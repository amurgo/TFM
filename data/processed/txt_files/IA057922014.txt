Law Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the  appellant's  appeal  on  human
    rights grounds against the respondent's decision to refuse to grant him
    continued  leave  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier   1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant, and against her concomitant decision to  remove
    him from  the  UK  by  way  of  directions  under  Section  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  The First-tier  Tribunal
    did not make an anonymity order, and I do not  consider  that  such  an
    order is required for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The claimant is a national of Nigeria, whose date of birth is 28 August
    1978.  On 4 February 2008 he was granted  leave  to  enter  the  United
    Kingdom as a student until 30 September 2009.  He was granted leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant until 7 October 2011.  His
    last grant of leave to remain was as a student, and his leave  in  this
    capacity ran until 2 March 2013.  He is  recorded  as  having  made  an
    application for leave to remain as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant
    during the currency of his student leave, which was refused on  20  May
    2013.  As evidence of access to funds, he had provided  a  bank  letter
    from the United Bank of Africa; a declaration from Mr  Adebiyi  Saheed;
    and a letter of validity from  Alfred  Olawale  &  Co  (barristers  and
    solicitors in Nigeria).  The bank letter from the United Bank of Africa
    was not acceptable as it did  not  confirm  that  the  institution  was
    regulated by the appropriate regulatory body  nor  did  it  confirm  Mr
    Saheed's contact details.  Furthermore, the letter of validity from the
    Nigerian legal representatives was not acceptable as it  did  not  show
    the registration authority of the  legal  representatives  to  practice
    legally in Nigeria which was where the declaration from Mr  Saheed  was
    made.  He had not therefore submitted the specified evidence as  listed
    under paragraph 41-SD to establish that he had access to the funds that
    he was claiming.

 3. The appellant made a fresh application for leave to remain as a Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant on 1 October 2013. He relied on access to  funds
    of �200,000 held in the United Bank of Africa in Nigeria.  He  had  not
    already invested any of the  funds  in  a  UK  business.   He  was  the
    director of a new or existing business, and his  standard  occupational
    classification most closely matched that of  engineering  professionals
    not elsewhere classified.  He said he had access to available funds  to
    support himself, and he  was  relying  on  personal  bank  or  building
    society statements covering a consecutive 90 day period.

 4. In support of his application he relied for evidence of maintenance  on
    documents from Crest Microfinance Bank in Nigeria.  In a  letter  dated
    24 July 2013 the bank confirmed that the appellant was the prime  mover
    of the "captioned accounts" and he held a savings account with  one  of
    their branches of which he was the sole signatory.  The  address  given
    for the claimant on the account was an address in Nigeria.  The closing
    balance in the account as of 22 July 2013 was 1,840,385.90 naira.   The
    appellant also provided a business current account  statement  for  the
    company which he had set up, Elight Integrated Services Limited.

 5. In a letter of 13 January 2014 the Secretary of State explained why she
    was refusing the claimant's application.  He had stated he  had  access
    to at least �200,000 to invest in business in the UK.  But as his  last
    grant of leave to remain in the United Kingdom was that  of  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student, he did not qualify for the award of points under the
    provisions in table 4A located in Appendix A, as per paragraph  36A  of
    that Appendix.  His application could only be  considered  under  table
    4B.  For the award of points he must  have  access  to  not  less  than
    �50,000 from either (i) one or more registered venture capitalist firms
    regulated by  the  Financial  Services  Authority,  (ii)  one  or  more
    registered UK entrepreneurial seed funding competitions which meets the
    requirements defined in Appendix A of the Immigration Rules;  or  (iii)
    one  or  more  UK  government  departments   or   devolved   government
    departments in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.  As he had provided
    no suitable evidence that he was receiving the funding from one,  or  a
    combination, of the above sources, he was not eligible for the award of
    points for attributes.

 6. The application was  also  refused  on  maintenance  grounds.   He  had
    provided bank statements from Barclays Bank plc and Crest  Microfinance
    Bank to demonstrate that he had been in possession of at least �900  of
    available funds for a consecutive 90 day period ending no more than  31
    days before  the  date  of  his  application.   The  most  recent  bank
    statements provided were dated more than 31 days prior to the  date  of
    the application.  The Barclays Bank statements  also  showed  that  the
    specified account was a business account,  and  so  did  not  meet  the
    specified requirements.

 7. In line with paragraph 245DD(l) of the Rules, an assessment as detailed
    in paragraph 245DD(h) of the Rules had not been carried out.  The  SSHD
    reserved the right to carry out this assessment in any challenge of the
    decision or in future applications for Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant
    status.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 8. The claimant's appeal came before Judge Metzer sitting  in  the  First-
    tier Tribunal at Taylor House on 30 June 2014.  Mr Slatter  of  Counsel
    appeared  on  behalf  of  the  claimant,  and  Ms  Jones,  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer, appeared on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State.
    Included in the claimant's bundle  for  the  hearing  was  the  refusal
    letter of 21 May 2013 in respect of  the  claimant's  original  Tier  1
    application of 20 November 2012.  As evidence of access  to  funds,  he
    had  provided  a  bank  letter  from  the  United  Bank  of  Africa;  a
    declaration from Mr Adebiyi Saheed;  and  a  letter  of  validity  from
    Alfred Olawale & Co (barristers and solicitors in Nigeria).   The  bank
    letter from the United Bank of Africa was not acceptable as it did  not
    confirm  that  the  institution  was  regulated  by   the   appropriate
    regulatory body  nor  did  it  confirm  Mr  Saheed's  contact  details.
    Furthermore,  the  letter  of  validity   from   the   Nigerian   legal
    representatives was not acceptable as it did not show the  registration
    authority of the legal representatives to practice legally  in  Nigeria
    which was where the declaration from Mr Saheed was made.   He  had  not
    therefore submitted the specified evidence as listed under paragraph 41-
    SD to establish that he had access to the funds that he was claiming.

 9. In his witness statement for the hearing, the  claimant  accepted  that
    there had been evidential deficiencies in his earlier application.   As
    a result of establishing, among other things, that Mr Olawale  did  not
    produce a practising certificate, he had been advised to  withdraw  his
    appeal against that decision.  Elight Integrated Services  Limited  was
    operating in the business of telecommunication, oil and  gas  services.
    It had been operating  in  the  UK  telecommunications  industry  since
    January 2013.  The company currently had a good  business  relationship
    with major telecom and oil companies like Ericsson UK, Vodaphone, Shell
    Nigeria  and  others  who  supplied  them  with  quality  products   at
    competitive prices.  He pleaded with the court to allow his  appeal  as
    his business was subsisting and ongoing.  His business  had  not  moved
    due to the travel restrictions placed on him.  If they were lifted,  he
    would be able to bring more business to the UK and to employ about five
    British people, and more, immediately.

10. He briefly referred to his family circumstances at  paragraph  23.   He
    had two children, a boy born on 1 April 2011 and a daughter born on  12
    April 2014 and they both needed him to be in the country to look  after
    them.

11. Mr Slatter's skeleton  argument  for  the  hearing  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal refers to a letter of  sponsorship  from  Mr  Saheed  dated  1
    October 2012.  In that letter, Mr  Saheed  described  the  claimant  as
    being an in-law.  At paragraph 4, he observed that although not  raised
    in the first refusal decision, the second refusal decision relied  upon
    paragraph 36A of Appendix A.  Mr Slatter submitted it was  not  obvious
    what the sufficiently important legislative objective was for  awarding
    points in a manner that was based on a last grant of leave  as  opposed
    to a previous grant of leave.  The claimant had enjoyed Tier  1  (Post-
    Study Work) status immediately prior to his last grant of  leave  as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.  There  was  no  rational  connection
    between the legitimate aim of the economic well-being  of  the  country
    and the specific provisions of the Rules.   This  was  relevant  to  an
    assessment of proportionality under Article 8.

12. He went on to say that the claimant had a wife and two children who had
    lawfully resided with the claimant  in  the  UK.   There  had  been  no
    breaches of immigration law.  The family  had  developed  private  life
    ties in the UK which would be interfered by  the  decision  to  remove.
    The general issues of needing to  limit  numbers  who  have  access  to
    public services and the benefits of the NHS, and who would be  able  to
    compete or housing and employment with  those  already  here,  did  not
    outweigh the economic interests of permitting the  development  of  the
    claimant's business and his economic investment into the UK.

13. The First-tier Tribunal was invited to allow the appeal  as  being  not
    compatible with the private life rights of the claimant and his  family
    members, and therefore unlawful.  This was so applying the general  law
    in relation to Article 8, rather than any provisions of the Immigration
    Rules.

14. In his subsequent determination, Judge Metzer  records  Mr  Slatter  as
    conceding that the claimant could  not  succeed  under  the  Rules  but
    submitting that he should succeed under Article 8.  Ms  Jones  conceded
    that his right to private life was engaged under Article  8(1)  of  the
    ECHR, and the  sole  issue  requiring  the  judge's  determination  was
    whether it  would  be  disproportionate  under  Article  8(2)  for  the
    claimant to be returned to Nigeria.

15. The judge found that the claimant was presently a telecom engineer  and
    the chief executive officer  of  Elight  Integrated  Services  Limited,
    which had operated in the UK telecommunications industry since  January
    2013 when he became a director of it.   He  found  that  the  documents
    demonstrated that cash money was available  to  the  claimant  who  had
    permission to use the money to invest  in  a  business  in  the  United
    Kingdom and was transferrable.  That  money  remained  available.   The
    United Bank of Africa was regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria, and
    it was clear that  the  claimant's  business  enjoyed  a  good  working
    relationship with a number of  well-known  and  substantial  companies.
    The judge continued:

         "Although it is acknowledged that  the  [claimant]  cannot  succeed
         under the Rules, I find that the [claimant] has established that he
         has substantial funds and backing available to him  and  that  such
         sums would be  immediately  transferrable  as  and  when  required.
         Taking into account the [SSHD's] legitimate interest in immigration
         control, and bearing in mind the [claimant]  and  his  family  have
         been in the United Kingdom for some time and  in  the  [claimant's]
         case for over six  years  and  taking  into  account  what  he  has
         achieved both as a  student  and  subsequently  in  regard  to  the
         business he has set up in the United Kingdom  and  the  substantial
         funds which he is proposing to invest in that  business  likely  to
         create further job opportunities, I find that taking  into  account
         the  [SSHD's]  legitimate  interest  in  immigration  control   and
         applying the Razgar five limb test, it would be a  disproportionate
         interference with the [claimant's] rights under Article 8(2) of the
         ECHR were the [claimant] to be returned to Nigeria."

The Application for Permission to Appeal

16. A member of the Specialist Appeals  Team  settled  an  application  for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on behalf of  the  Secretary
    of State.  The judge had erred in  law  by  finding  that  the  refusal
    engaged the operation of Article  8.   Secondly,  the  judge  erred  by
    having  regard  to  the  claimant's  apparent  near-miss  against   the
    requirements  of  the  Rules  as  a  relevant  consideration   in   the
    proportionality analysis.  Thirdly, the judge erred in law  by  failing
    to identify compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised  under
    the Rules in order to ground an arguable case for the  grant  of  leave
    outside the Rules.  Fourthly, the judge erred in law by failing to have
    regard in the  proportionality  exercise  to  the  public  interest  in
    effective immigration control.

The Grant of Permission

17. On 31 July 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge Fisher granted permission  to
    appeal for the following reasons:

         It is clear that the judge was not assisted at all  by  the  SSHD's
         representative at the hearing, who  conceded  that  Article  8  was
         engaged, and submitted that the sole issue  for  determination  was
         that of proportionality.  It is equally clear that the SSHD gave no
         consideration to either paragraph 276ADE  or  Appendix  FM  in  her
         refusal letter.  Nevertheless, in accordance with the  decision  in
         Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC), the judge was required to consider
         whether there were  any  compelling  circumstances  for  warranting
         consideration of Article 8 on conventional  grounds.   Instead,  he
         proceeded to consider Article 8 of the ECHR on  the  basis  of  the
         concession that  the  claimant  was  unable  to  meet  the  Tier  1
         requirements.   It  is  also  arguable  that   his   reasoning   on
         proportionality was inadequate.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

18. At the hearing before me, Mr Slatter mounted a robust defence of  Judge
    Metzer's determination, developing the arguments advanced by him in  an
    extensive Rule 24 response.

19. Mr Wilding submitted that the Rule 24 response highlighted another flaw
    in the judge's determination which had not been specifically raised  in
    the grounds of appeal, which was a lack  of  adequate  reasoning.   The
    claimant's application was  always  doomed  to  fail,  as  he  was  not
    eligible to rely on funding from a private individual.  The Rule  which
    prevented him from doing this  had  been  attacked  by  Mr  Slatter  as
    irrational, but the judge had wholly ignored this aspect of  the  case,
    and had simply purported to exercise a general dispensing power,  which
    was completely contrary to authority, in particular paragraph  [57]  of
    the Supreme Court case of Patel.  Mr Slatter's attack was in any  event
    unjustified.  The restriction had been introduced to  combat  extensive
    abuse, and therefore it had a legitimate objective.

20. After hearing Mr Slatter in reply, I ruled that an  error  of  law  was
    made out.  I gave my reasons for so  finding  in  short  form,  and  my
    extended reasons are set out below.  Mr Slatter and Mr Wilding were  in
    agreement that no further  evidence  needed  to  be  elicited  for  the
    purposes of the decision being remade, and that the Upper Tribunal  was
    the appropriate forum for the remaking of  the  decision.   I  received
    brief further submissions from both parties  as  to  how  the  decision
    should be remade.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

21. A concession of fact by a Presenting Officer should be accepted by  the
    Tribunal, but not a concession of law if that concession is  erroneous.
    The concession made by Ms  Jones  was  erroneous  in  law.   While  the
    claimant had clearly resided in the United Kingdom for  a  sufficiently
    long period such that his  private  life  rights  were  engaged,  Judge
    Metzer should not have embarked on an old-style Article  8  assessment,
    applying the five point Razgar test, without  first  analysing  whether
    there was a viable claim under Rule 276ADE;  and,  if  there  was  not,
    applying the test set out in Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) and  Gulshan
    [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC), namely that only if there may be  arguably  good
    grounds for granting leave to remain outside the Rules, is it necessary
    for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider  whether  those  compelling
    circumstances are not sufficiently recognised under them.

22. It does not matter that the claimant did not apply for leave to  remain
    on private life grounds,  or  that  the  Secretary  of  State  did  not
    consider Rule 276ADE when making a removal decision  against  him.   By
    raising an Article 8 claim in his appeal, the claimant brought Appendix
    FM and Rule 276ADE into play.  These Rules set out how the Secretary of
    State considers the balance should be struck in family and private life
    claims. So it is necessary to consider a family or private  life  claim
    through the prism of the new Rules first, in order to get to the  point
    of being able to ascertain whether there are arguably good grounds  for
    granting leave to remain outside the Rules.

23. Mr Slatter referred me to MM  (Lebanon)  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985,  where
    Aikens LJ at [128] said:

         Nagre does not add anything to the debate, save for  the  statement
         that if a particular person is outside the  rule  then  he  has  to
         demonstrate, as a preliminary to a consideration outside the  rule,
         that he has an arguable case that there may  be  good  grounds  for
         granting leave to remain outside the  rules.   I  cannot  see  much
         utility in imposing  this  further,  intermediary,  test.   If  the
         applicant cannot satisfy the rule, then there either is or there is
         not a further Article 8 claim.  That will have to be determined  by
         the relevant decision-maker.

24. Mr Slatter submitted that this showed that Nagre  and  Gulshan  are  no
    longer good law.  I do not consider this to be case, not least  because
    Aikens LJ's remarks are obiter and the Nagre threshold test  was  cited
    with approval by the Master of the Rolls in MF (Nigeria) v SSHD. So far
    as I am aware, Aikens LJ is a lone voice at Court of  Appeal  level  in
    questioning the utility of applying a threshold test (i.e. is  there  a
    good arguable claim outside the rules?) before deciding whether  it  is
    necessary to embark on an old-style Article 8 assessment, applying  the
    five point Razgar test.. In any event, Aikens  LJ  is  not  giving  his
    approval to what occurred in this  case.  He  says  that  the  relevant
    decision-maker must determine whether there is  or  is  not  a  further
    Article 8 claim. This  necessarily  implies  an  anterior  requirement:
    which is for the decision-maker to determine first whether there is  an
    Article 8 claim within the Rules.

25. At paragraph [134] of his judgment, Aikens LJ says:

         Where the relevant group of IRs, upon  their  proper  construction,
         provide a 'complete code' for dealing with  a  person's  Convention
         rights in the context of a particular IR  or  statutory  provision,
         such as in the case of  'foreign  criminals',  then  the  balancing
         exercise and the way the various  factors  are  to  be  taken  into
         account in an individual case must be done in accordance with  that
         code, although references to  'exceptional  circumstances'  in  the
         code will nonetheless entail a proportionality  exercise.   But  if
         the relevant group of IRs is not such a 'complete  code'  then  the
         proportionality test will be more at large, albeit  guided  by  the
         Huang tests and UK and Strasbourg case law.

26. As there is not a complete code in respect of the Article 8  rights  of
    failed Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrants, the proportionality test is more
    at large, but it is very far  from  being  unfettered.   The  following
    passage in paragraph [105]  of  Shahzad  (Article  8:  legitimate  aim)
    [2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC) is pertinent to this case:

         Applying the main principles we  have  derived  from  case  law  on
         Article 8(2) to the judge's assessment of the claimant's  case,  it
         will be immediately apparent that the judge wrongly  addressed  his
         task when considering the proportionality of the legitimate aim  of
         'economic  well-being'  (which  was  the  only  legitimate  aim  he
         considered to be  engaged).   Although  making  reference  to  'the
         legitimate aim of securing the economic well-being  of  the  UK  by
         sensible immigration control' (which clearly identified  that  this
         head extended to the general (or 'macro') level, he wholly confined
         his  actual  assessment  of  the  weight  to  be  attached  to  the
         legitimate aim pursued by the decision of  the  SSHD  to  a  simple
         calculus at the individual or  'micro'  level,  so  that  all  that
         appeared in the balance sheet were the funds the claimant had  paid
         in course fees and the fact that he  had  enough  to  maintain  and
         accommodate himself.  He wholly overlooked that even in cases where
         there is no cost to the state incurred by an individual student  in
         terms of fees and maintenance and  accommodation,  the  immigration
         rules reflect  an  assessment  made  by  the  government  with  the
         sanction of Parliament of what requirements are necessary in  order
         to ensure sufficient control on the number of persons entering into
         or being able to stay in the UK and for how  long  and  under  what
         conditions.  Their terms quintessentially require an assessment  at
         the 'macro' level.  He failed to take into account whether  general
         aspects of 'economic well-being', including the need to  limit  the
         numbers who have access to public services and the benefits of  the
         NHS and who are able to compete for housing and for employment with
         those already here ...

27. This passage highlights the flaw in Judge Metzer's approach.  In  Rules
    which have been laid before  Parliament  the  Secretary  of  State  has
    deliberately limited the eligibility of applicants in the  position  of
    the claimant to those who can show  access  to  investment  funds  from
    designated sources within  the  UK.   The  justifications  for  such  a
    limitation lie at  a  macro  level.   But  Judge  Metzer  confined  his
    assessment of the weight to be attached to the legitimate  aim  pursued
    by the decision of the Secretary of State to a simple calculus  at  the
    individual or micro level, so that all  that  appears  in  the  balance
    sheet are what the claimant can personally contribute to the UK through
    his business, and the employment opportunities which he  says  it  will
    create.  Judge Metzer wholly fails to take  into  account  the  general
    aspects of economic well-being, including the need to limit the numbers
    who have access to public services and the benefits of the NHS and  who
    are able to compete for housing and for employment with  those  already
    here.

28. In addition, the judge does not mention at  all  the  central  argument
    relied on by Mr Slatter in support of the Article 8  claim,  which  was
    that there was no rational connection between  the  legitimate  aim  of
    preserving the country's economic well-being and the specific provision
    in the Rules which prevented the claimant from  relying  on  investment
    funding from a relative in Nigeria.  It is  reasonable  to  infer  that
    this argument underpins Judge Metzer's conclusion  on  proportionality.
    But as it is not discussed, the losing party does not know why she  has
    lost.

29. In conclusion, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is  vitiated  by
    an error of law due to a lack of  adequate  reasoning,  such  that  the
    decision should be set aside and remade.

The Remaking of the Decision

30. Paragraph 36A was introduced into the Rules by HC 760  on  13  December
    2012.  The appellant's first application as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    Migrant was made before  this  date,  and  this  may  explain  why  the
    provision was not invoked when this first application was refused.   In
    any event, the first application fell to be refused for other reasons.

31. It is not suggested that the claimant has a viable claim under Appendix
    FM of the Rules, or indeed under Rule 276ADE.  The claimant has  strong
    connections to Nigeria, as  he  and  all  members  of  his  family  are
    Nigerian nationals.  They would be returning together, and so there  is
    no question of the children being left behind in the UK  without  their
    mother or father. Moreover, the claimant is related as an in-law to  Mr
    Saheed, the source of the investment funds, and  the  claimant  has  an
    address in Nigeria, as evidenced by his account with Crest Microfinance
    Bank.  So there is no indication  that  the  claimant  would  have  any
    difficulties whatsoever in living and working in Nigeria,  rather  than
    living and working in the UK.

32. Turning to an Article 8 claim outside  the  Rules,  in  the  claimant's
    favour is the principle  that  the  threshold  for  the  engagement  of
    private life rights is relatively low.  On the other hand, there is  no
    right to work or study per se in  the  country  of  one's  choice,  and
    equally there is no right per se to set up a business in the country of
    one's choice.  The claimant has never had a legitimate  expectation  of
    being able to remain with his  family  in  the  United  Kingdom  on  an
    indefinite basis.  He  entered  the  United  Kingdom  for  a  temporary
    purpose, and his  extensions  of  leave  have  also  only  been  for  a
    temporary purpose.  The expectation has been that  he  will  return  to
    Nigeria at the end of his limited leave, unless he  can  bring  himself
    within a Rule enabling him to further extend his  stay  here  with  his
    family.

33. As he is facing removal, I am persuaded that questions 1 and 2  of  the
    Razgar test  should  be  answered  in  his  favour.   I  consider  that
    questions 3 and 4 of the Razgar test should be answered  in  favour  of
    the respondent, so the issue in controversy is proportionality.

34. Mr Slatter's principal argument on proportionality  is  that  the  Rule
    preventing the claimant from relying  on  funding  from  Mr  Saheed  is
    irrational, or can be stigmatised as being arbitrary and objectionable.
     Alternatively,  it  can  be  said  to  operate  disproportionately  in
    relation to him, as the effect is to require him to return  to  Nigeria
    in order to apply for leave to enter.

35. Mr Slatter's attack on paragraph 36A is not supported by any  evidence.
    The general principle is that he  who  asserts,  must  prove.   In  any
    event, I  am  satisfied  that  as  originally  introduced  the  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  scheme  was  open  to  abuse,  and  that   the
    introduction of Rule 36A was part of a package of  measures  introduced
    in December 2012, and subsequently in the spring of  2013,  to  prevent
    abuse.

36. Judge Metzer found that the funding in question was genuinely available
    to the claimant. But it was not open to him, nor is it open to  me,  to
    rewrite the Rules so as to fit in with the facts of a particular  case.
    The claimant has at all times had the benefit of legal  representation,
    and following the introduction of paragraph 36A in  December  2012,  he
    had no legitimate expectation of being able to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom as a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  relying  on  investment
    funding from a relative in Nigeria.  The claimant's last grant of leave
    to remain was as a student, and studying is what he is supposed to have
    been doing during the currency of this student  visa.   So  he  has  no
    grounds for complaint that the effect of the  removal  decision  is  to
    prevent him from continuing to operate  a  telecommunications  business
    which he set up in January 2013, during the  currency  of  his  student
    visa. He was never going to be able to obtain leave to remain to pursue
    such a business.  Furthermore, it was not part of the  evidence  before
    the First-tier Tribunal that he had committed funds or resources to the
    development of the business in the UK which would be lost if he had  to
    return to Nigeria.  The burden of his  complaint  was  simply  that  he
    could not realise his ambition to grow the business which  he  had  set
    up.

37. Against this background, there is no substance in the argument that  it
    is unreasonable to require the claimant to return to Nigeria.  It is  a
    matter for him whether he seeks to return as a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    Migrant. In such circumstances,  he  will  not  have  to  surmount  the
    barrier of paragraph 36, which only applies to those seeking  leave  to
    remain.  It is not disproportionate that the claimant should  be  faced
    with this choice: the choice between remaining in Nigeria to pursue his
    business interests there or seeking to return to the United Kingdom  as
    a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.

38. I am satisfied that the proposed interference strikes  a  fair  balance
    between the rights and interests of, on the one hand, the claimant  and
    affected family members, and, on the other hand, the wider interests of
    society.  It is proportionate the legitimate public interests ought  to
    be achieved, namely the protection of the country's economic well-being
    and the prevention of disorder.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the  decision  is  set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is
substituted: this appeal is dismissed on all grounds raised.
