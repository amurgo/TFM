R (on the application of ZM and SK) v The London Borough of Croydon  (Dental
age assessment) [2016] UKUT 00559 (IAC)


Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber)

Heard at Field House
on 7 and 17 October 2016



             IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW



                                   Before

                      MR C M G OCKELTON, VICE PRESIDENT


                                   Between


                     THE QUEEN ON THE APPLICATION OF ZM
                                                                   Applicant
                                     and

                          LONDON BOROUGH OF CROYDON
                                                                  Respondent


                                     And

                     THE QUEEN ON THE APPLICATION OF SK

                                     and

                        THE LONDON BOROUGH OF CROYDON
                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

Mr I Wise QC and Mr C McCarthy instructed by Bhatia Best Solicitors,
appeared on behalf of both Applicants.

Mr J Swirsky, instructed by London Borough of Croydon Legal Department,
appeared on behalf of the Respondent.



   1.   Considerable circumspection must always be deployed in responding to
      a claim that statistical evidence tends  to  prove  a  fact  about  an
      individual.  Statistics may be more useful to decision-makers  at  the
      far ends of the scale (where they may be able to show the plausibility
      or implausibility of a proposition) than in the middle  of  the  scale
      where they purport to show the likelihood  of  the  correctness  of  a
      plausible proposition.


   2.   When considering statistical evidence  it  is  always  necessary  to
      determine whether the population constituting the database from  which
      the statistics are drawn is sufficiently identical to  the  population
      from which the individual is drawn.


   3.   The fact that all teeth are  mature  in  the  sense  that  all  have
      reached Demirjian stage H is a sign of chronological maturity  but  is
      not a reliable indicator of whether an individual is more or less than
      18 years old. The use of the  Demirjian  stages  below  stage  H  does
      appear to be more reliable in the prediction of age,  particularly  in
      the lower teens.


   4.   None of the three mandibular  maturity  markers  so  far  identified
      appears yet  to  have  attained  such  acceptance  in  the  scientific
      community  that  it  can  be  accepted  as  a  reliable   pointer   to
      chronological age in the late teens in males.

   5.   Dental wear is not a guide to chronological age in  the  absence  of
      data for a population with similar  diet  and  masticatory  habits  to
      those of the person under examination.

   6.  The decision of the Court of Appeal in London Borough of Croydon v  Y
      should not be read as prohibiting a person from refusing to undergo  a
      dental examination.  However, (i) the risk inherent in the exposure to
      x-rays during the taking of the  dental  panoramic  tomograph  is  not
      likely to be a reasonable ground for refusing to allow  the  tomograph
      to be made, given the advantages stemming  from  ascertainment  of  an
      individual's true age, and (ii)  despite  the  reservations  expressed
      herein, analysis of a person's dental maturity may well have something
      to add to the process of assessing chronological age.

   7.   It therefore follows that generally speaking the taking of a  dental
      tomograph should be ordered if a party seeks it, and (because  of  the
      process of dental maturity) the earlier the tomograph  is  taken,  the
      more likely it is to be of assistance.


                          DECISION ON APPLICATIONS

   1. This judgment contains general guidance on  the  use  of  evidence  of
      dental development in the assessment of age.


   2.   In  each  of  these  judicial  review  applications,  the  applicant
      challenges the assessment of his age by the respondent London  Borough
      of Croydon.  ZM arrived in the United Kingdom in 2015.  He says he  is
      from Afghanistan and was born on 10 May  2001.   He  was  assessed  by
      social workers working for London Borough of Croydon.  They decided on
      23  November  2015  that  he  was  over  18  years  old.  The  present
      proceedings were issued on 4 December 2015.  Permission was granted by
      Picken J at an oral hearing on 28  January  2015  and  the  claim  was
      transferred to this Tribunal.

   3. SK came to  the  United  Kingdom  in  2015.   He  claims  to  be  from
      Afghanistan and to have been 15 years old at the time of  his  journey
      to the United Kingdom.  An age assessment  was  undertaken  by  social
      workers employed by Croydon; their decision on 16 September  2015  was
      that he was over 18.  The present claim was issued on 1 October  2015.
      Permission was granted by Sir Stephen Silber on 28  January  2016  and
      the matter was transferred to this Tribunal.

   4. In each case application notices have been filed  by  the  respondent.
      For present  purposes  they  are  to  similar  effect.   They  may  be
      summarised as seeking an order from the Tribunal that  the  respondent
      be permitted to rely on expert evidence from Professor Graham  Roberts
      (whose relevant expertise is in dental  development).   It  is  common
      ground that in each case it will be necessary for a dental x-ray to be
      taken as part  of  Professor  Roberts'  assessment.   The  respondents
      further seek in each case an order that  if  the  applicant  does  not
      agree to be assessed by Professor Roberts (including by the taking  of
      the x-ray) his claim be struck out.  In the application relating to ZM
      further disclosure is also sought, and the respondent seeks  an  order
      that the claim be stayed as an alternative to being struck out if  the
      applicant does not comply  with  either  element  of  the  substantive
      directions sought.

   5. These applications  were  listed  for  hearing,  with  copious  expert
      evidence,  including  in  particular  a  full  report  from  Professor
      Roberts, and supporting documentation  and  articles,  on  10  and  17
      October 2016.  I heard oral evidence from Professor Roberts, called by
      Croydon; Professor Cole, one of the applicants' witnesses, assisted me
      in the analysis of Professor Roberts' evidence, but did not in the end
      give substantive evidence.  At the conclusion  of  Professor  Roberts'
      evidence I gave my provisional views on it and on the application.  It
      was agreed that no further oral evidence was necessary and the  matter
      proceeded to submissions.  At  the  end  of  the  submissions,  on  17
      October, I decided that the applicants should undergo the  x-rays  and
      that  the  parties  would  be  at  liberty  to  rely  on  such  expert
      interpretation of the x-rays as became available to them: I  indicated
      that the full reasons for those directions would follow in writing.

   THE LEGAL BACKGROUND AND THE BACKGROUND TO CROYDON'S APPLICATIONS

   6. The starting point in these cases, as in most age assessment cases, is
      that the applicant claims as a child to be entitled to services  under
      or derived from the Children Act 1989.  The local  authority  declines
      to provide the services, on the ground that the applicant  is  not  in
      truth a child.  The issue of the applicant's age is thus the matter in
      dispute.  In R (A) v Croydon LBC  [2009]  UKSC  8  the  Supreme  Court
      decided that to the question whether an individual  is  or  is  not  a
      child "there is a right or wrong answer" (Lady Hale at [27]) and  that
      it was for the Court to determine it.  Subsequent decisions have  made
      it clear that the determination of an applicant's age is to be made on
      all the evidence available and, where relevant, an assessment  of  its
      credibility.  Although the formal dispute between the parties is as to
      the accuracy or otherwise of an assessment already made, the Court  is
      not concerned merely with choosing between  the  age  claimed  by  the
      applicant and the age assessed by the respondent, but, in the exercise
      of its supervisory jurisdiction, it is to decide  on  the  balance  of
      probabilities whether the applicant was or was  not  a  child  at  the
      relevant time (R (CJ) v Cardiff City Council [2011] EWCA Civ 1590).


   7. The Supreme Court's decision in A is based firmly on  the  wording  of
      the Children Act 1989.  Numerous challenges to age assessments on  the
      basis of their actual accuracy have subsequently been  brought.   Most
      have been transferred to, and are decided by, this Tribunal.  Although
      as a result of the decision  in  A,  it  is  clearly  the  Court's  or
      Tribunal's task to determine an individual's  age  in  proceedings  of
      this type, there is no reason at all to suppose that a judge,  looking
      in detail at the evidence made available in  a  single  case,  is  any
      better at determining a person's age  than  competent  social  workers
      constantly dealing with young  people,  some  of  known  and  some  of
      unknown age.  Indeed, the reverse is probably true.  And there is,  of
      course, no way of telling whether or not  the  judicial  decision  has
      been accurate in any of the  cases  that  have  been  the  subject  of
      litigation, nor whether it has been more accurate  than  the  original
      decision under challenge.  It is within  everybody's  experience  that
      some individuals, particularly individuals in their  teens,  may  seem
      much more mature (or less mature) than their known age would  suggest.
      As a result, everybody knows that there is no sure way of assigning  a
      chronological age to an individual, particularly a  teenager  or  late
      teenager, on the basis of physical, mental or social  characteristics.
      Age assessment judicial reviews  are  lengthy  and  expensive,  almost
      always  wholly  at  public  expense.   The  only   certainly   correct
      propositions that can be made about them are that  they  enable  those
      professionals involved in them to derive an  income  from  the  public
      purse, and that the system satisfies the demands of the  law,  however
      irrational it may be to  regard  its  substantive  results  as  either
      correct or an improvement on any other age-assessment system.

   8. In this context it is not surprising that there has been a search  for
      a testing process which might enable an accurate, objective assessment
      of the age of a young person whose age is unknown.  In  recent  years,
      one of the targets of interest and research has been related to dental
      development.  Some  respectable  opinions  suggest  that,  in  certain
      circumstances, an examination of an  individual's  dental  development
      can give a very clear and accurate guide to that individual's age.

   9. Because of the geographical situation of  Home  Office  premises,  the
      London Borough of Croydon is a frequent respondent in  age  assessment
      claims.  It appears to have adopted  the  view  that  age  assessments
      based upon dental development are sufficiently reliable to be of great
      assistance, although Mr Swirsky emphasised to me that Croydon does not
      seek a dental age assessment in every  case.   In  London  Borough  of
      Croydon v Y [2016] EWCA Civ 398 Croydon had applied to  this  Tribunal
      for an order that Y's challenge to his age assessment should be struck
      out (or stayed) unless he consented to and cooperated fully with (i) a
      dental examination (including a dental x-ray)  by  Professor  Roberts,
      (ii) a psychiatric examination and (iii) a further age  assessment  by
      two Croydon social workers.  The applicant made it clear that he would
      not cooperate with the dental examination.  The Tribunal  refused  the
      order sought.  On appeal, the Court of Appeal decided that each of the
      reasons given by the Tribunal for refusing the order  was  not  sound.
      The order itself could therefore not stand.  The Court substituted  an
      order granting the application.  In the words of  the  Master  of  the
      Rolls, who gave the lead judgment, at [22]:


           "Having rejected the three reasons relied on by the judge, I  am
           satisfied that the judge should have made the  order  sought  by
           Croydon.  It was reasonably necessary to enable it to defend the
           challenge to its  age  assessment.   Y's  refusal  to  give  his
           consent was unreasonable."


  10.  It  is,  I  think,  fair  to  say  that  the  only  consideration  of
      reasonableness was in relation to the timetable (on  which  the  Court
      found that the judges' assumed concerns were misplaced),  not  on  the
      substantive question  of  the  efficacy  of  evidence  from  Professor
      Roberts or any dangers arising from the dental x-ray.   At  [23],  the
      Master of the Rolls said this:


           "By way of a postscript, I  wish  to  add  two  points.   First,
           although Y's expert witnesses have diagnosed  him  as  suffering
           from complex PTSD, it is not suggested on his behalf that any of
           the three requested assessments would  cause  him  psychological
           harm.  Secondly, it is said that the  method  of  assessing  age
           using mean data taken from dental x-rays  is  controversial  and
           unreliable.  But it is impossible  for  the  court  to  reach  a
           conclusion on whether this is correct or not.  In  my  view,  it
           cannot be a reason  for  refusing  the  order.   No  doubt,  the
           reliability of the assessment based on  dental  x-rays  will  be
           investigated at the hearing."


  11. So far as dental examination is concerned, the orders  sought  in  the
      present cases are similar to that in Croydon v Y.  I do not,  however,
      read the decision of the Court of Appeal in that case  as  prohibiting
      for all time the refusal of  such  an  application.   As  the  closing
      paragraphs of the Master of the Rolls' judgment made clear, a  crucial
      question is whether in an individual case the conduct  of  the  person
      opposing the application is reasonable.  Further the decision  of  the
      Court of Appeal was made in the context of no decision being taken  on
      the extent to which evidence derived from dental x-rays  could  assist
      age assessment in general or the assessment  before  the  Tribunal  in
      that particular case.


  12. It is not clear from the decision whether Y had indicated  any  reason
      for his decision to refuse to  cooperate.   In  the  present  cases  a
      reason  was  formulated:  the  perceptible  danger  of   exposing   an
      individual to x-rays.  That  is  a  matter  that  therefore  fell,  or
      appeared to fall, for consideration as part of  the  determination  of
      the respondent's applications.

   THE ISSUES


  13. In considering whether the orders ought to  be  made  in  the  present
      cases, and what, if any, guidance can be given  on  the  use,  in  age
      assessment judicial reviews, of a data obtained  from  dental  x-rays,
      the following considerations therefore arise.  First, what can be said
      about dental development as  seen  by  x-radiograph  or  otherwise  in
      relation to the chronological age of an  individual?   What  data  are
      available, and what observations can  reliably  be  made  about  those
      data?  Secondly, to what extent can the answers to the first  question
      be used to reach a conclusion about the age of an individual whose age
      is unknown? In particular, to what extent can  the  data  be  used  to
      determine whether an individual of unknown age is more or less than 18
      years old?  The answer to these questions  depends  not  only  on  the
      availability of data, but on  the  propriety  of  reasoning  from  the
      statistical  analysis  of  a  database   to   the   determination   of
      characteristics of an individual not within that  database.   Thirdly,
      given that a Tribunal is unlikely to be able to assess  the  raw  data
      itself, is the interpretation provided by  an  expert  (and  Professor
      Roberts in particular) sufficiently reliable to assist the Tribunal in
      determining an individual's age?  Fourthly,  what,  if  any,  are  the
      dangers of undergoing a dental x-ray?


   THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPEARANCE OF TEETH


  14. This section is intended to  be  an  uncontroversial  summary  of  the
      relevant parts of the material before me.  More controversial  issues,
      including the interpretation and use of the  materials  summarised  in
      this section, are included in subsequent sections.


  15. Human teeth emerge individually and develop gradually.  It is possible
      to observe their emergence and other morphological features  during  a
      clinical examination, but a detailed examination of dental development
      requires an x-ray.   The standard method used is  a  dental  panoramic
      tomograph, which, by recording data from around the outside the mouth,
      provides an image showing all the teeth in more or less straight lines
      with their roots arrayed and so  readily  examinable.   The  tomograph
      enables  individual  teeth  to  be  assigned  to  specific  stages  of
      development.

  16. Several systems of classification of stages have been proposed.   That
      used by Professor Roberts and, as appears from  the  literature,  very
      many others, is derived from a paper  by  Demirjian  and  others  [1],
      although the assessment process outlined in that paper is not  adopted
      by Professor Roberts or perhaps by anybody  else.   Eight  stages  are
      identified, lettered A-H: I do not need to set these out, save to  say
      that the difference between G and H is that in G the ends of the  root
      canals  are  still  partly  open,  whereas  in  H  they   are   closed
      (specifically, in molars, the distal root is closed).  The description
      of stage H includes  also  the  following  wording:  "The  periodontal
      membrane has a uniform width around the root and apex".   The  8-stage
      scheme is said to be amenable to accurate application,  in  the  sense
      that analysts can  readily  be  trained  to  assign  individual  teeth
      accurately to the correct stage.


  17. Individual teeth attain different  stages  at  different  speeds,  but
      typically teeth nearer the front of the mouth are at a later stage  of
      development than those further back.  The third molars[2] are the last
      to emerge and normally the last to achieve full maturity at stage H.

  18. It is apparent from the foregoing that a tooth which has  not  reached
      stage H is somewhere on its road to doing so, but a  tooth  which  has
      reached stage H is fully mature;  and  if  the  entire  dentition  has
      reached stage H no further development that can be described by the 8-
      stage process can take place.  Until then, it is possible to provide a
      description indicating which (if any) of the teeth have reached  stage
      H and, in addition, listing those teeth which have reached  other  and
      if so what stages.  A number of databases have been  assembled,  which
      have been available  to  individual  authors.   There  are  thus  data
      relating to a number of different groups.

  19. The reference data set used by Professor Roberts is that assembled  by
      the Dental Age Research London Information Group (DARLInG), consisting
      of a large number of white Caucasians of known age.  Because  a  stage
      earlier than H is, during  the  process  of  dental  maturation,  both
      achieved and lost (by attainment of the next stage), it  is  possible,
      by comparison with the database, to  generate  information  about  the
      ages between which the stage in question typically occurs in the tooth
      in question.  The more immature teeth there are in the mouth, the more
      information can be generated in this way and, it  is  said,  the  more
      accurate is the prediction of the age of an individual of unknown age.
       The method used is a simple average: the average ages of those in the
      reference data set displaying the observed stage  of  each  individual
      tooth are themselves averaged together to provide a predicted age  for
      the  individual.   This  is  accompanied  by  an  estimate  of   error
      calculated as the inter-  quartile  width,  similarly  averaged.   The
      results, tested by prediction in this way of the  age  of  individuals
      whose chronological age is in fact known, but not to the examiner, are
      impressive at the beginning of the teenage years.   Not  surprisingly,
      it appears that this method loses accuracy as the number  of  immature
      teeth available to be used in the calculation decreases as more  teeth
      attain stage H.  Nevertheless, the simple average method, as described
      above, is used by some  examiners  for  the  purposes  of  dental  age
      assessment in all cases where there is at least one tooth that has not
      reached stage H.


  20. This method is not applicable when all the teeth have reached stage H:
      the dentition is mature and will remain mature whether the  individual
      is 17, 37 or 87.  Further, because of the way in  which  the  data  is
      assembled,  that  is  to  say,  typically,  by  the   examination   of
      individuals at unplanned stages of their dental development, there  is
      no way of knowing how long an individual showing mature dentition  has
      been in that state.  The tooth that most recently achieved stage H may
      have done so six months ago or two years ago or (in  the  case  of  an
      older individual) twenty years ago.  What can be done is to record the
      ages of those whose tomograph shows completely mature  dentition.   In
      each case this is not, and can not be, a record of the  age  at  which
      the individual achieved dental maturity: it is, instead, a  record  of
      the lowest possible age at which dental maturity was  reached.   In  a
      large database, however, these data can usefully be compared with  the
      ages of those who were at  the  last  stage  before  completed  dental
      maturity, that is to say, with one tooth only  at  stage  G.   In  the
      result, data for the attainment of stage H in all  teeth,  or  in  the
      lower left third molar, which is regarded as a diagnostic sample, have
      been collected for a number of populations.


  21. There is considerable difficulty in determining whether those data can
      properly  be   converted   into   probabilistic   estimates   of   the
      chronological age of a person of unknown age who is  dentally  mature.
      Without any detailed calculation, the sparsity  of  records  of  young
      teenagers with teeth all at stage H might well suggest that a  claimed
      age of 13 is highly unlikely.  Much more difficult is  the  assessment
      of the probability of the individual in question being  more  or  less
      than 18 years old.  The difficulty arises not merely  because  of  the
      inherent dangers of calculating the facts from probabilities, to which
      I advert below, but because the data collected do not  have  a  Normal
      Distribution.   That is the consequence both of the  method  of  their
      collection and of the fact  that  an  individual  with  fully  matured
      dentition may be very substantially older than the age at which he  or
      she achieved mature dentition.  One method of deriving an estimate  of
      probability from data of this sort is by a process of censoring, which
      attempts to confine the data used in the analysis to data which  might
      properly contribute to it.  The symmetry or assessable skewness  of  a
      Normal Distribution demands that appropriate censorship  criteria  are
      used at both the upper and the lower ends of the age range.  There  is
      considerable  dissent  between  experts,  apparent  in   the   present
      applications, as to how censoring should properly be done and  whether
      Professor Roberts' method is effective or accurate.   Be  that  as  it
      may, predictions of age based on  the  fact  that  an  individual  has
      achieved stage H in all his teeth, and his lower left third  molar  in
      particular, have been produced and apparently widely used.


  22. In the previous discussion it has been  assumed  that  no  development
      takes place beyond stage H.  In recent years attention has been  given
      to determining whether teeth which  have  reached  stage  H  show  any
      further signs of maturation.  The result has been  the  identification
      of three  separate  "mandibular  maturity  markers".   As  their  name
      suggests, these are not strictly directed to the  teeth,  but  to  the
      lower jaw (mandible) in which they sit.  The  examinations  have  been
      confined to cases where the lower left third molar has attained  stage
      H.  It is not clear whether the markers described are  dependent  upon
      the achievement of stage H or whether any of them may be  observed  in
      relation to earlier Demirjian stages.

  23. The three proposed mandibular maturity markers are as follows.

  24. First, Root Canal Width.  This marker  proceeds  upon  the  assumption
      that following the attainment of  stage  H,  the  width  of  the  root
      canals, as perceived on the tomograph, narrows  in  each  tooth.   The
      assessment of root canal width is a comparison of the perceived widths
      of the root canals in all three lower left molars.   Three  stages  or
      grades are described.  In grade 1 (or  A),  the  widths  of  the  root
      canals in the first molar are less than those  in  the  second  molar,
      which in turn are less than those in the third molar.  At grade 2  (or
      B) the widths are the same  for  the  first  and  second  molars,  but
      narrower than the third molar.  In grade  3  (or  C)  the  root  canal
      widths are the same in all three molars.  The  database  available  to
      Professor Roberts enabled him to examine root canal widths in about  a
      thousand tomographs.  Using the criteria I have set out, he found that
      the minimum age of the attainment of grade 3 (C)  in  that  population
      was 18.45 years for females and 18.16 for  males.   Surprisingly,  the
      minimum age of attainment of stage B was 18.29 for males.  There is no
      published account of this anatomical  phenomenon  or  (therefore)  any
      published reaction to it, but a paper by Professor Roberts and  others
      was presented to the American Academy of Forensic Science in  February
      2016 and a revised version of it has been accepted for publication  in
      the Journal of Forensic Sciences. [3]


  25. The second mandibular maturity marker is Root Pulp  Visibility.   This
      is based on an analysis of the appearance of  the  root  pulp  in  the
      lower left third molar.  At stage A the  pulp  is  visible  along  the
      whole length of both root canals,  at  stage  B  it  appears  to  have
      retreated in one canal but not the other; at stage C it has  retreated
      almost fully in one canal and begun to retreat in the other; at  stage
      D the root pulp is not visible in either root canal.  It is (so far as
      I understand Professor Roberts' oral evidence) not clear whether  this
      phenomenon is a result of dental change, or of maturation and  perhaps
      greater opacity of the mandible.

  26. This marker was first published by Olze and others in 2010  [4]  in  a
      reference data set of about 1200 individuals.   They  found  that  the
      minimum age for the attainment of stage C in females was  rather  over
      23 years and in males rather over 22  years  (I  have  summarised  the
      results in that way because of the distribution of individuals amongst
      the various stages).   A further examination of root  pulp  visibility
      was published by P�rez-Mongiovi and others in 2015  [5].   Their  data
      set  consisted  of  much  smaller  population.   The  minimum  age  of
      attainment of stage C was 18.8 years in  females  and  18.1  years  in
      males.  The authors concluded that  their  analysis  does  not  wholly
      support the analysis of Olze, but that stage D (which, like Olze, they
      call "stage 3", their  scale  being  0,  1,  2,  3)  can  be  used  as
      indicating that females are over 21 but that "in males, other  markers
      should be used".   Professor Roberts' analysis is of about a  thousand
      individuals, but, as it happened, the overwhelming  majority  were  at
      stages A or B.  The minimum ages for the attainment of  stage  C  were
      18.58 in females and 18.16 in males and of stage D  22.45  in  females
      and 20.19 in males.  The arithmetic mean was over 23 years old in each
      of those four cases,  with  (again  in  each  case)  an  error  margin
      represented by the inter-quartile width of about a year each way.  The
      data for stages C and D, were, however, limited to 49 females  and  75
      males.  Dr Lucas (who works with Professor Roberts and is in fact  his
      wife) and others, including Professor Roberts, have submitted a  paper
      [6] presenting these results and suggesting that root pulp  visibility
      provides a clear indication of whether or not subjects  are  below  or
      above 18 years old.


  27.  The  third  mandibular  maturity  marker  is   Periodontal   Ligament
      Visibility.  It will be remembered that the  description  of  stage  H
      includes a reference to a periodontal ligament of uniform width around
      the  tooth,  but  without  reference  to  its  visibility.  The  x-ray
      visibility  of  the   periodontal   ligament   or   membrane   reduces
      progressively as the tooth (again, in particular, the lower left third
      molar) settles into position.  Radiographically,  a  visible  ligament
      appears as a space between the tooth and the mandible.  The stages are
      A: 100% of the ligament visible (that is, the space appears all around
      the tooth); B: 75-50% of  the  ligament  visible;  C:  50-25%  of  the
      ligament visible; D: 0% of the ligament visible.  Those are the stages
      proposed by Professor Roberts.  The gaps between A and B and between C
      and D (for example, 85%  and  20%  do  not  fall  within  any  of  the
      described stages) are unexplained.  In the pioneering  paper  on  this
      topic, again by Olze and others[7] the stages are 0, 1, 2, 3  and  the
      definition is in descriptive rather than numerical terms.

  28. Olze examined about 1200 individuals and found that in every case  the
      minimum age for the attainment of his stage 1 (= Roberts' B) was  over
      18 years.  In a sample of nearly 500 Portuguese subjects Sequeira  and
      others[8] were not able to confirm Olze's results precisely, but  were
      able to conclude that the achievement of stage 3 in males suggests  an
      age of more than 21 (the minimum was 19.1 and the mean 26.9), but that
      a different process would have to be used for the  assessment  of  the
      age of females.  Professor  Roberts'  analysis  of  about  a  thousand
      individuals from the database available to him  showed  a  minimum  of
      over 18 years in both sexes for the attainment  of  stages  C  and  D,
      albeit only just over 18 for stage C and a little over 18 and  a  half
      in both sexes for stage D.  The averages for those stages were over 22
      and over 23 for both sexes and the inter quartile width between  about
      one and about two years either side.  A paper by Dr Lucas  and  others
      including Professor Roberts  with  the  ambitious  title  "Periodontal
      Ligament Visibility - A Conclusive Mandibular Maturity Marker  at  the
      18-year Threshold" is forthcoming  in  the  International  Journal  of
      Legal Medicine.


  29. It is perhaps worth observing  in  relation  to  Periodontal  Ligament
      Visibility first that, as my description  of  the  stages  shows,  the
      definitions are perhaps a little vaguer than in relation to the  other
      markers, and secondly that the published data, in particular, those of
      Olze, show that the attainment of the final  described  stage  is  not
      necessarily to be regarded as a feature of youth.  In  the  population
      examined, 135 females and 112 males were 35  or  over,  but  only  115
      female lower third molars and 145 male lower third molars  were  found
      at the most mature stage.  (As the figures in the tables  make  clear,
      in many individuals both lower third  molars  were  examined  and  the
      results presented).


  30. A further sign of age, observable by clinical examination rather  than
      by radiograph, is dental wear.  In the  present  cases,  Croydon  have
      made it clear that they do not rely on dental wear  as  diagnostic  of
      age, but in my judgment it has to feature in a general  assessment  of
      the  evidence,  not  only  because  it  is  apparently  used  by  some
      examiners, but because specifically Professor Roberts uses or has used
      it.  The only authority to which I was directed is  a  1975  paper  by
      Akpata. [9]  He used a scoring of dental attrition following the  work
      of T R Murphy, who had studied aboriginal Australians.  The scale runs
      from 0 to 10.  Akpata's sample examined each of the molars  (totalling
      352 in all) available for examination in a population aged between  20
      and 80.  He found that in each age group the attrition score  for  the
      first molar would be higher than that for the others.   He  concluded,
      however, that there is "a very high degree of relationship between age
      and the mean attrition score for the first molar".   The  results  are
      presented in a number of ways, including a graph showing selected mean
      attrition scores plotted against the age of the individual.


  31.  It  is  said  that  the  progress  of  dental  maturity  is  governed
      genetically, not by features such as wealth or nutrition.   If  it  is
      governed genetically, the genetic make- up of the reference data  sets
      may be of some interest.  Indeed many authors specifically state  that
      comparability is attainable only by reference to a  comparable  racial
      or ethnic  group.   This  is  clearly  Professor  Roberts'  view.  The
      assertion appears not only in his opinion for this  case  but  in  his
      chapter in the Encyclopaedia of Forensic and Legal Medicine [10]:

          "The primary data source for DAA  should  be  a  RDS  based  on  a
          clearly defined racial or ethnic group."

  32. Similar observations are found in Sequeira[11]:


          "These data concern only the Portuguese population, and for  other
          populations specific-population data should be used",


      and by Olze [12] who indicates that although no data on the  ethnicity
      of the population he examines have been collected, it may  be  assumed
      to be almost wholly Caucasian.  In terms of  the  progress  of  dental
      maturation this view is not, however,  universally  accepted.   P�rez-
      Mongiovi, [13] gives a contrary view as follows:

          "The ossification rate  can  be  affected  by  the  socio-economic
          status of the patient, meaning that the use of x-ray standards  on
          a person of  a  lower  socio-economic  status  than  that  of  the
          reference population usually leads to an underestimation of  their
          age Still, similarly to other skeletal maturation  methods,  there
          is a  low  impact  of  ethnicity,  allowing  x-ray  standards  for
          forensic age estimation to be applied in different ethnic  groups,
          regardless of the reference population sample".


      Professor Liversidge, both in her written evidence before  me  and  in
      her published work [14]  considers  that  only  small  differences  in
      average ages are attributable to ethnic differences.

  33. It would be inappropriate in this section to comment further  on  that
      difference of opinion.  It is, however, relevant to what follows  that
      Professor Roberts has  noted  a  difference  in  the  average  age  of
      attainment for stage H of  the  lower  left  third  molar  in  various
      geographical surveys.  He records this as  follows,  the  first  being
      from his own research on the DARLInG  database  and  the  others  from
      published research of other authors:


      |UK Caucasian            |19.40                    |
|Kuwait                  |20.36                    |
|Israel                  |20.96                    |
|Korean (South)          |21.10                    |
|Chinese (Han)           |22.40                    |



  34. This is also the appropriate place to note that in a 2009  paper  [15]
      Knell and others examined data available to them in Switzerland.  They
      divided the sample into those from Switzerland and  those  from  South
      Eastern Europe, including the Balkans and Turkey.  It was  found  that
      the latter  population  achieved  dental  maturity  about  six  months
      earlier than the Swiss population, although the  sample  was  somewhat
      limited.


  35. Finally, it is to be noted that  in  his  paper  on  tooth  attrition,
      Akpata says that:


          "For tooth attrition to be applied in age determination, the  rate
          of wear must first be established for the community  with  similar
          diet and chewing habits".

   REASONING FROM STATISTICS: DECIDING BY NUMBERS


  36. In this section  I  consider  some  of  the  issues  arising  from  an
      invitation to a judge to make findings of  fact  based  on  calculated
      probabilities.  It is not necessary to undertake a full  treatment  of
      the issue, and it would be presumptuous  to  try.   But  a  number  of
      things said during  the  hearing  drew  attention  to  the  scope  for
      misunderstanding; and in a judgment that is supposed to give  guidance
      it is therefore desirable to draw attention to these matters.  In what
      follows I do not attempt to set out the basis of proof by induction or
      of the calculation of probabilities based on statistics.  Instead, the
      two examples below, and the  observations  connected  with  them,  are
      intended to illustrate some of the differences between  the  world  of
      statistics and the world of the judicial  fact-finder,  and  to  alert
      judges to some of the alarm bells that ought to ring  in  their  minds
      when they are asked to act on statistical  evidence  or  to  say  that
      because analysis of a database can produce a probability of more  than
      (or perhaps a good deal more than) 50% for a contested fact the  judge
      should regard it as proved.


  37. Suppose there are 100 young men in a room: they have a common  feature
      - for example they play a particular  sport  at  a  particular  level.
      Their ages are known, and recorded in years and months.   In  summary,
      two are 19 (ie having had their 19th birthday  but  not  their  20th),
      eighty-four are 18, ten are 17, three are 16  and  one  is  15.    The
      average (mean) age is  18  years  7  months  (but  as  it  happens  no
      individual is of that age exactly).  Now suppose that the records  are
      all destroyed or become hopelessly confused, so that there is  no  way
      of knowing which person had which age. One person leaves the room  and
      comes before a judge for age assessment.  With no  other  information,
      what can be said (or 'found', to the civil standard) about his age?

  38. Clearly he is not under 15, and equally clearly he is not over 20.   A
      bookmaker (or statistician) could provide the betting odds that he is,
      for example, at least 18.  Similarly, calculations could be made about
      the range of error and the likelihood of any particular  error  if  it
      were to be decided that he has the mean  age  of  18  years  7  months
      (which we happen to know cannot be his actual age).  But none of  this
      will help to tell which of the hundred young men in fact came  out  of
      the door.  We know that one was only  15,  and  there  is  nothing  to
      suggest that the person who came out was not  that  one.   Being  told
      that the chances that a person leaving the room is over 18 are 86% (or
      whatever) does not help a bit.

  39. Further, the statistical probabilities  or  odds  calculated  in  such
      circumstances rely on the selection of one person to  leave  the  room
      being random.  If it turns out, for example, that after  the  loss  of
      the records everybody was rushing to get out  of  the  room,  and  the
      person in charge of the exit door said that the youngest should  leave
      first, odds based on random exit are obviously  worthless.   In  those
      circumstances the persons who leave first are highly likely  to  be  a
      combination of (a) those  who  know  they  are  amongst  the  youngest
      present; (b) those who, correctly or incorrectly, think they  are  the
      youngest present; and (c) those who know  they  are  not  amongst  the
      youngest present, but think they can get away with claiming they are.

  40. Most ordinary statistical calculation of probabilities  depends  on  a
      number of basic assumptions.  One  is  that  the  database  accurately
      reflects the background from which the unknown fact whose  probability
      is to be calculated has come.  This factor is  avoided  in  the  above
      example by knowing that the person came out of the room.  It is  clear
      that if the prediction was to be about a 101st young man, who had  not
      been in the  room  at  all,  but  also  plays  sport  at  that  level,
      assumptions would need to be made about whether the one hundred in the
      room represented all people playing sport at that level, so that facts
      about the hundred were to be taken as facts about the whole group.


  41. The second basic assumption, made in many  but  not  all  mathematical
      calculations, is that the statistics being studied are distributed  in
      a standard fashion,  showing  a  'bell  curve',  symmetrical  about  a
      central point which is both the mean (arithmetical  average)  and  the
      median (half of the recorded figures are lower, and half  are  higher,
      than the  median).   If  the  curve  is  not  symmetrical,  meaningful
      calculations can still be made; but if the distribution is not of this
      form the calculations will not work.  In the example of the young  men
      in the room, if (instead of their age in years and months) the  number
      of exact birthdays they had each had had been recorded,  any  hope  of
      doing statistical calculations would be gravely compromised by any who
      gave figures between 3 and 5, having been born on 29 February.   Steps
      would have to be taken to  exclude  or  censor  these  figures  before
      calculations could be made.

  42.  The  third  assumption,  made  in  many  simple   and   less   simple
      calculations, but entirely inappropriate for many others, is that  the
      event or fact whose probability is being  calculated  bears  a  random
      relationship  to  the  records  in  the  comparable   database.    The
      calculation of probabilities of the age of the person who emerged from
      the room based solely on the known distribution of ages  in  the  room
      only works if the person leaving the room is or can  be  taken  to  be
      chosen at random.  If that assumption cannot  be  made  the  odds  are
      wrong.  If heights as well as ages had been recorded and  if  it  were
      known, for example, that the  person  leaving  the  room  was  in  the
      shortest twenty-five per cent, the calculation again could be made, of
      the probability of the person being over 18, given that he was in  the
      shortest twenty-five per cent.  But as is clear from the example about
      the youngest being told to leave first, the part  of  the  calculation
      that is the 'given' may be incalculable  or  more  or  less  so.   The
      calculation of odds based on preconditions not precisely known is  the
      realm  of  bookmakers  and  punters  rather  than  statisticians,  and
      bookmakers and punters do not always get it right.


  43. One final point to make on this example is  that  if  the  statistical
      calculations of probability were to be relied upon to make  a  finding
      of fact in relation to age, it looks as though each of the  people  in
      the room, assessed separately, would be found to be 18  or  over.   We
      know that that would be incorrect in 14 of the 100 cases, although  of
      course we would never know which.

  44. Take another example.  Suppose the resolution of a civil case  depends
      on the question whether it  rained  in  Little  Marple,  a  hamlet  in
      Gloomshire for which no detailed records are available, on 26  October
      1999.  The rainfall records for Gloomshire show that year  after  year
      there is rain on 25 of the 31 days in October.  Based on that alone it
      is difficult to see that one would be justified  in  finding  that  it
      rained in Little Marple on 26 October; and even if the figures  showed
      that there was more rain towards the end of the month that  would  not
      help very much.  What the statistics  would  provide,  however,  is  a
      matrix within which other evidence might be assessed.   With  so  much
      evidence of October being a rainy month in  Gloomshire,  it  might  be
      easier to accept the evidence of an otherwise frail witness  who  said
      he remembered having to put his galoshes on to go out to  dinner  that
      night.  If the month had been June  and  the  evidence  that  rain  in
      Gloomshire in June is exceptionally rare, the same evidence might  not
      have been so readily capable of being accepted.


  45. In that example, the thing to note is that the  reasoning  moved  into
      quite informal language.  Statistical probabilities  can  be  combined
      with other statistical probabilities, but they  are  not  amenable  to
      precise combination with other forms of inductive reasoning.  They can
      nevertheless provide a valuable matrix for the consideration of  other
      evidence.

  46. What is also apparent  is  that  whereas  for  most  purposes  of  the
      calculation of statistical probabilities the most informative data are
      measurably close to the mean, once the reasoning moves away  from  the
      mathematical to the judicial, it is the extremes that are likely to be
      most useful.   The  phrases  used  above  were  'a  rainy  month'  and
      'exceptionally rare'.  If the relevant month had been  September,  and
      the records showed that there is rain on 19  of  the  thirty  days  of
      September, it is perhaps unlikely that either that  statistic  or  any
      probability calculated from it would be  of  any  perceptible  use  in
      determining the issue.

  47. The conclusions that may be drawn are warnings rather than guidance or
      instruction.  First,  figures  produced  may  be  misleading,  and  in
      particular the fact that an element of evidence is adduced in  numeric
      form does not mean  that  it  is  entitled  to  be  regarded  as  more
      persuasive.  Secondly, if probabilities are presented, it  is  crucial
      to ensure that any  factors  counting  against  randomness  have  been
      properly factored in, and it is essential that the database  used  for
      the calculations is genuinely appropriate for the individual  fact  in
      issue.   Thirdly,  material  derived  from  a  database  may   be   of
      considerable use if it shows that the fact claimed  is  impossible  or
      highly unlikely; and in that context such material may assist  in  the
      assessment  of  the  reliability  of  other  evidence.   Fourthly,  an
      assessment of the probability of a basic fact  about  a  person  where
      that fact is plausible but unknown is unlikely  to  be  assisted  very
      much by a statistical probability doing little  more  than  confirming
      plausibility.  Fifthly, judges  should  be  extremely  cautious  about
      accepting a submission that a calculated probability of a figure  over
      fifty per cent means that a fact is  proved  to  the  civil  standard.
      Judicial proof is a matter of persuasion,  not  mathematics;  and  the
      crucial question may well be: supposing I  make  a  finding  based  on
      these figures, how likely is it that I shall be wrong and is that risk
      acceptable in the context of this case?


   THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE


  48.  In  this  section  I  intend  to  state  my  conclusions  about  what
      propositions can properly be derived from the available data that  are
      relevant to the assessment of  the  age  of  a  person  whose  age  is
      unknown.  The conclusions in this section are intended to be  general:
      I deal with Professor  Roberts'  use  of  the  material  in  the  next
      section.  In this section I deal first (A-C) with the  possibility  of
      predictions where the individual of unknown age has a  similar  ethnic
      background to the individuals surveyed in an available reference  data
      set.  I then turn at D to the additional issues raised by this process
      of age assessment where no such reference data set is available.


   A.  Where one or more teeth have not reached Demirjian stage H

  49. Where there are immature teeth in the mouth, the simple average method
      described in section 3 above appears to  be  quite  reliable.   It  is
      clearly more reliable if the number of immature teeth is  greater:  so
      it is more reliable if the individual is  younger.   The  evidence  on
      assessment at the 10-and 13-year old boundaries adduced  by  Professor
      Roberts was impressive: there was no specific discussion of it at  the
      hearing but I did not receive the  impression  that  the  use  of  the
      simple average method based on a substantial database is  the  subject
      of serious dissent amongst the scientific community.   It  may  be  of
      limited assistance in age assessment cases, because the claimants  are
      not usually young enough for there  to  be  a  substantial  number  of
      immature teeth to provide a potentially accurate prediction of age  by
      this means.  That is not, however, the  end  of  the  matter  for  age
      assessment purposes.  One thing that is clear is that  the  earlier  a
      tomograph is taken, the more likely it is to show immature teeth,  and
      therefore the more likely it is that there will  be  scope  for  using
      data relating to immature teeth.


   B. Where all teeth have reached Demirjian stage H

  50. As dental maturity is a sign of general  maturity,  a  great  deal  of
      attention has been paid to the possibility of predicting age from  the
      fact of the acquisition of mature dentition.  This poses  considerable
      difficulties, as explained above.  The age  at  which  the  individual
      achieved dental maturity is not normally known: all that can  be  said
      is that it was a date before the date of the x-ray.  That  error  will
      operate to attribute an age younger than the  true  age  (because  the
      stage H data all relate to subjects older than the date of achievement
      of stage H): whatever may be thought about the desirability  of  that,
      it is an error nonetheless.  More crucial is the  fact  that  plotting
      age against number of  individuals  with  mature  dentition  does  not
      produce a symmetrical graph, because all  individuals  achieve  mature
      dentition if they survive long enough to do so.  Thus, calculations of
      probability  based  on  standard  deviations   appear   to   have   no
      application.  One possible solution is the censoring of  the  data  to
      confine  it  to  an  apparently  relevant  age  group,  but,  as   was
      demonstrated at the hearing, there is no universally accepted  way  in
      which this  can  be  done.   A  further  difficulty  arises  precisely
      because, for most individuals, dental maturity is achieved in the late
      teens, and the attribution of an age of above  or  below  18  by  this
      method is therefore extremely hazardous: the  eighteenth  birthday  is
      likely to be within the margin of error of the prediction.  Indeed, in
      a recent paper [16] Professor Roberts with others concluded  that  the
      prediction of whether a person had  achieved  his  or  her  eighteenth
      birthday based on all teeth being seen at Demirjian stage H  would  be
      wrong almost as often as it was right: as he put it, the  process  was
      no better than tossing a coin.  I shall have to refer  to  this  paper
      again in the next section.

  51. Despite these considerations, it is clear that dental maturity is  one
      of the markers of general maturation and hence of a chronological  age
      likely to be in the latter half of the teens.  What is  likely  to  be
      more persuasive than a calculation based on the  inter-quartile  width
      is a basic statement of the  minimum  age  of  a  person  with  mature
      dentition observed in the database, perhaps with  some  indication  of
      the number of individuals in the year of age each side of that.   That
      material might, in an appropriate case, lead to an observation that no
      individual of the appellant's claimed age (or, only a tiny minority of
      individuals of the appellant's claimed age)  had  been  observed  with
      mature dentition.  But unless the case permits an observation of  that
      strength, it may well be that the mere fact that an individual's teeth
      are  all  at  Demirjian  stage  H  can  contribute   little   to   the
      determination of whether he or she has obtained the age of  18  years:
      it merely confirms the plausibility of that hypothesis.

   C. The Mandibular Maturity Markers.

  52. This is a developing  field.   Despite  the  confidence  expressed  by
      Professor Roberts I am wholly unpersuaded that any of  the  mandibular
      maturity markers is as yet backed up by sufficient expert analysis  to
      be reliable as an indicator of age.


  53. Although two of the Markers (Root  Canal  Visibility  and  Periodontal
      Ligament Visibility) have been the subject of  papers  other  than  by
      Professor Roberts and his colleagues, the results (in  particular  the
      predictions of age derived from them) show  little  agreement.   There
      are obviously several possible reasons for this.  One may be that  the
      samples are not yet large enough.  One may be a difference  in  ethnic
      background (a matter to which  I  return  in  general  later  in  this
      section).  A further possibility is that the authors of the  different
      papers were not observing precisely the same phenomena: although  each
      paper is based  on  a  cross-checking  of  the  comparability  of  the
      observations being made, there  does  not  appear  to  have  been  any
      checking between the authors of the different papers, and where  in  a
      new field comparatively isolated analyses occur there  may  be  little
      opportunity for precise comparison of the opinions  of  the  different
      analysts.  Professor Roberts and his colleagues are in the process  of
      contributing to the literature on each of the three markers: one, Root
      Canal Width, has, so far as I am aware, been observed and analysed  by
      the DARLInG team only.  Although all the papers have been accepted for
      publication, none of them has yet been subject to  debate:  acceptance
      for  publication  indicates  that  the  hypothesis  of  the  paper  is
      respectable: it does not mean that it  is  correct.   I  am  therefore
      unable to share the confidence expressed in the title of the paper  by
      Professor Roberts  and  his  colleagues  in  relation  to  periodontal
      ligament visibility, and in general it does not appear to me  that  it
      is yet right to allow determinations of age to be based too firmly  on
      any of the Mandibular Maturity Markers.

  54. Nevertheless, it may well be worth collecting data on them,  in  case,
      as knowledge develops, assessments of age based on  them  become  more
      clearly reliable.

   D. Ethnic Background

  55. I now turn to the issue of the ethnic make up of the various available
      reference data sets.  The view that ethnic  background  is  of  little
      effect or importance in the relationship between chronological age and
      dental maturation is, as I have said, held by some authors, but it  is
      very far from easy to accept.  The available  data  mentioned  in  the
      table in para 33 above appear at least to show that dental  maturation
      in some far eastern  populations  is  achieved  later  than  in  white
      Caucasians  in  the  DARLInG  database.   This  introduces  a  further
      likelihood of error into age assessments based on any given  reference
      data set, unless the individual being assessed is of the  same  ethnic
      background as the members of the reference data set.

  56. There is no reference data set for young Afghan males.  The  dates  of
      birth are not officially recorded in Afghanistan, and it has therefore
      been assumed that  it  would  be  impossible  to  compile  a  database
      including analysed dental tomographs of Afghans of known  age.   I  am
      not confident that that assumption is correct.  It is true that births
      are not recorded in Afghanistan, but, (given that the  determinant  is
      ethnic background rather than place of birth)  it  is  not  clear  why
      attention has not yet been given to those of Afghan parentage born  in
      other countries where records are kept, for example, Russia,  Pakistan
      and western countries.  There appear, indeed, to be no available large
      reference data sets of any comparable racial or ethnic group, which is
      somewhat surprising[17].  In the  circumstances  it  is  difficult  or
      impossible to ascertain the error introduced by  use  of  a  reference
      data set composed of individuals of an ethnic background different  to
      that of an Afghan individual being examined.  The level  of  potential
      uncertainty appears to be high: there is not, for example, any obvious
      reason for supposing that the data for unexamined ethnic groups  falls
      within the limits so far ascertained in examined ethnic groups.


  57. So far as  concerns  dental  attrition,  the  authoritative  paper  by
      Akpata, to which reference is made in section 3, makes it  clear  that
      deductions from observed tooth wear depend on a knowledge of the  diet
      and chewing habits of the relevant population.  There appears to be no
      evidence that any other population has diet and chewing habits similar
      to those in the population analysed by Akpata.

   PROFESSOR ROBERTS' OPINIONS

  58. Professor Graham  Roberts  currently  holds  a  position  of  Visiting
      Professor  at  King's  College  London.   His  clinical  and  academic
      activities continue vigorously following his retirement from full-time
      employment.  His career in clinical dentistry and dental pathology has
      been extensive and distinguished.  He is the author or joint author of
      numerous articles and parts of books, for  the  most  part  on  dental
      pathology and related topics but his curriculum vitae (running  to  38
      pages in the copy provided to the Tribunal) includes some 30  articles
      related to dental age assessment.  All but 6 have been published since
      2010.  The journals of  publication  range  from  the  British  Dental
      Journal and the Journal of  Forensic  Science  to  the  Indian  Dental
      Association Times.  His knowledge and expertise are  beyond  question.
      They were demonstrated at the hearing, as also, if I may say so,  were
      his teaching abilities: he was able to put across complex concepts  in
      a way that enabled them to be understood by mere lawyers.  He  has  in
      the past few years, perhaps largely since his retirement from a  full-
      time Chair, made dental age assessment his particular speciality.  His
      knowledge of this area, its scientific  background  and  the  research
      literature, is encyclopaedic.


  59. He has also provided, either alone or jointly with Dr Lucas, over  650
      dental age assessments.   A sample of such an assessment  is  attached
      to his written expert report.

  60. The present applications by Croydon relate not only to the acquisition
      of dental maturity data from the individuals who  have  brought  these
      claims: they seek also an order  that  they  be  allowed  to  rely  on
      Professor  Roberts'  opinion  evidence.   It  is  therefore  of   some
      importance to determine not merely whether the  techniques  of  dental
      age assessment are sound, but whether Professor  Roberts'  opinion  in
      relation to individual cases is reliable.  Thus, during  the  hearing,
      considerable attention was paid  to  the  sample  report  provided  by
      Professor Roberts and to setting that report in  the  context  of  the
      other evidence, including his own evidence  about  his  own  views  of
      areas some of which are controversial.  Typically, a social worker  or
      a Court or Tribunal will have the raw data interpreted in the form  of
      a report such as that exhibited by Professor Roberts.  It is therefore
      important to know whether the views expressed in such  report  can  be
      accepted on the faith of the knowledge of the author of the report, or
      whether it is proper to have any reservations about them.

  61. The sample report is anonymised: in what follows  "X"  represents  the
      redacted name of the individual.  The part of the report dealing  with
      age assessment is in the following terms:

          "A. Stage of Development of the Lower Left Third Molar


          The feature of note on the radiograph of X is that the lower  left
          third molar is at stage H (LL8Hm) in its development.  This  means
          that it is completely formed and will not  develop  further.   The
          lower right third molar is a mirror image of the lower left  third
          molar.  For age estimation purposes it is appropriate to  consider
          only the LL8.


          The data for this stage of the development in males indicate  that
          on average, the subject is 19.40 years old.  The middle 50% of the
          data (the inter quartile width) ranges from 18.10 years  to  20.91
          years - a span of 2.81 years.  The probability that X is under  18
          years is 0.2037.  The corollary to this is  that  the  probability
          that X is over 18 years is 0.7963 (79.63%).


          The plain English version may be stated as  "X  is  likely  to  be
          19.40 years plus or minus 1.405 years".


          B. Root Pulp Visibility


          A further biological marker is the loss of visibility of the  Root
          Canal  Pulp  as  discerned  on  the  Dental  Panoramic   Tomograph
          [radiograph of all the teeth visualised on a single x-ray].


          The youngest that X could be using this parameter is 25.2 years.


          C. Periodontal Ligament Visibility


          An additional biological marker is visibility of  the  periodontal
          ligament discernable on a Dental Panoramic Tomograph.


          The youngest that X could be using this parameter is 26.2 years.


          D. Tooth wear


          The wear discernable on the occlusal (biting) surfaces is a  clear
          indicator of an age over 20 years.  The  wear  has  been  assessed
          using the criteria described in Nigeria.


          This gives an age assessment of 27 years.


          Plain English explanation


          The data available related to these four methods of estimating age
          indicate very  strongly  that  X  is  19.4  years  or  more.   The
          information available on
             B. Root Pulp Visibility,
             C. Periodontal Ligament Visibility, and
             D. Tooth Wear indicates that there is  very  strong  likelihood
             that X is over 25 years old.


          There remains the question of the  role  played  by  ethnicity  in
          growth  and  development  of  the  teeth.   [There  is   then   an
          introduction to the figures set out in the table in para 33 above,
          and those figures are given].


          It is clear that the further east from  the  prime  meridian,  the
          higher the average age for the attainment of stage H of the  lower
          third molar i.e. completion of root growth."


  62. References are given to a 2010 paper by Lewis and Senn  on  assessment
      of age using the development of the third molar and to the  papers  by
      Olze and Akpata and to the Encyclopaedia  chapter,  to  which  I  have
      already referred[18], but no further explanation is given and no other
      reservations are stated.  The date of this sample report has also been
      redacted, save for the year, which is 2015.   The  individual  was  of
      Afghan origin.


  63. That report invokes four separate methods of age assessment  based  on
      the appearance, radiographic or morphological, of the subject's teeth.
       Each one of the four assessments raises, in my judgment, considerable
      concerns, contained as each of them is  in  a  report  from  Professor
      Roberts in 2015. (That is to say, the earliest possible  date  of  the
      report is 1 January 2015; the latest  possible  date  is  31  December
      2015; there is no more precise  information  about  the  date  of  the
      report.)

  64. First, the report communicates an assessment of age based on the  fact
      that the lower third molars are at  Demirjian  stage  H.   As  I  have
      already said, that is a process of age assessment that is or has  been
      used widely.  So far as Professor Roberts is  concerned,  however,  he
      and Dr Lucas (the other signatory of  the  report  under  examination)
      submitted their paper casting very serious doubt on the reliability of
      age assessment by this method to the Journal of Forensic Sciences on 7
      July 2015.  That means that for the second half of the year  Professor
      Roberts is on record as holding the  view  expressed  in  that  paper,
      which is that the assessment of whether a person is over or  under  18
      by the use of this method is not much better than tossing a  coin,  as
      he put it in his evidence.  But, of course, neither the research,  nor
      the writing of the paper, nor its preparation by four nominal  authors
      for publication, can have been done instantaneously.  The truth of the
      matter is that this view must have been adopted by  Professor  Roberts
      considerably before the date of the submission of the paper.   Bearing
      in mind the previous history of age assessment  by  this  method,  the
      very undertaking of the research suggests  that  the  authors  of  the
      paper were sceptical about the accuracy about that method.  In  short,
      I regard it as in the highest degree unlikely that at any date in 2015
      either Professor Roberts or Dr Lucas held  the  view  that  the  first
      method of age assessment used in their report was reliable.  But there
      is no suggestion of that in their  report  itself.   Mr  Wise  pressed
      Professor Roberts on this at the hearing.  Professor Roberts  did  not
      say  that  this  showed  that  the  report  must  have  pre-dated  his
      suspicions or research: he simply said that this was a method that was
      frequently used.


  65. I should say also that, at the hearing, Professor  Roberts  was  clear
      that he no longer uses the attainment of stage H in  all  teeth  as  a
      measure of age: instead, the attainment of stage H  in  all  teeth  is
      simply the borderline between the use of  the  simple  average  method
      (available if not all teeth have reached stage H) and  the  mandibular
      maturity markers when all teeth have reached stage H.


  66. The second method of age assessment in the report under examination is
      Root Pulp Visibility.  In  this  part  of  the  report,  there  is  no
      indication of the stage said to be observed, but  the  statement  that
      the youngest that the subject could be using this  parameter  is  25.2
      years, with a reference to Olze's paper, indicates that the stage  was
      stage 3.  There is no reference to the fact that  there  had  been  no
      confirmation of Olze's data.  On 24 June 2015  P�rez-Mongiovi's  paper
      was produced, giving a minimum age of 19.1 for the attainment  of  the
      same stage in males.  Clearly  if  (but  only  if)  the  report  under
      examination was produced in the first six  months  of  the  year,  one
      could not expect a reference to the  latter  paper.   The  report  is,
      however, produced as  an  appropriate  sample  attached  to  Professor
      Roberts' evidence dated 6 September 2016.   There  appears  to  be  no
      suggestion that it  would  be  appropriate  either  to  refer  to  the
      different implications arising from the P�rez-Mongiovi  paper,  or  to
      offer any recognition that the difference in the results of that paper
      and the Olze paper may cast doubt on the accuracy  of  age  assessment
      based on the data in either of the papers.


  67. The third method used in the report under examination  is  Periodontal
      Ligament Visibility.  Here, using the same method  of  interpretation,
      it can be ascertained that the  subject  had  attained  stage  3,  and
      Olze's figures are passed on to  the  reader  of  the  report  without
      comment.  The paper by Sequeira and others was accepted by the Journal
      of Clinical and Experimental Dentistry on 26 July 2014, and  published
      in the last number for 2014.  It was thus available to anybody writing
      a report in 2015.  The minimum age  for  a  male  exhibiting  stage  3
      development according to that paper is 19.1 years.  Here, because  the
      paper came out before the report, it must be  regarded  as  even  more
      surprising that there are no references to it  or  to  the  danger  of
      relying on Olze's figures.

  68. There is a further difficulty in the use of  two  separate  Mandibular
      Maturity Markers.  In summarising the work done  on  them  so  far,  I
      noted the apparent  lack  of  any  evidence  that  any  of  the  three
      Mandibular Maturity Markers  are  dependant  upon  the  attainment  of
      Demirjian stage H.  It is also true,  however,  that  there  does  not
      appear as yet to be any examination of whether  they  are  independent
      one of another.  Each of  the  published  analyses  to  which  I  have
      referred deals with one of them: I was not referred to any analysis of
      two or three of  them  in  conjunction.   This  is  relevant  for  the
      following reason.  If in any individual they are  independent  one  of
      another, they provide separate pieces of information,  each  of  which
      may (if  this  method  is  reliable  at  all)  provide  assistance  in
      assessing the age of the individual.  If, however, the one or more  of
      the ways in which the development  of  maturity  has  apparently  been
      detected is dependent upon another, that is to say if they operate  in
      parallel in each individual or (in  particular)  if  any  of  them  is
      caused by any  of  the  others,  then  although  a  second  Mandibular
      Maturity Marker observation will help to confirm the accuracy  of  the
      first, the two together say no more than one.   In  the  report  under
      examination, root pulp visibility and periodontal ligament  visibility
      are treated as though they are separate indicators of age.  I  do  not
      think that there is any proper basis for that: so far as I  have  been
      told, they may only be separate confirmation of a more general  notion
      of mandibular maturity.

  69. The fourth age assessment method relied on by Professor Roberts in the
      report is Tooth Wear.  Here it is said that the  wear  observed  is  a
      clear indicator of an age over 20 years, with an estimate of 27  years
      based on Akpata's paper.  As I have already indicated, Akpata's  paper
      contains a warning not to use  tooth  wear  as  an  indicator  of  age
      without  knowledge  of  the  nutrition  and  chewing  habits  of   the
      population under examination.   Anybody  reading  Akpata's  paper  and
      thinking that Professor Roberts was reliable  would  no  doubt  assume
      that Professor Roberts had appropriate data for the age assessment  of
      an Afghan male by tooth wear.  In fact, that is  not  the  case.   The
      lack of such data does not, however, discourage Professor Roberts from
      making an estimate.  As he said in the course of his evidence,  it  is
      appropriate to make an assessment on  the  data  that  are  available.
      That applies, apparently, even if the data are not shown to  have  any
      relevance at all to the subject being examined.

  70. So far  as  ethnic  variation  is  concerned,  Professor  Roberts  was
      insistent in his evidence that he himself makes no adjustment: what he
      does is to set out  the  available  data  for  different  populations.
      That, as has been seen, is what the  report  under  examination  does.
      However, the report goes further: it asserts that "it  is  clear  that
      the further east from the prime meridian, the higher the  average  age
      for the  attainment  of  stage  H  of  the  lower  third  molar,  i.e.
      completion of root growth".  That was  a  view  upon  which  Professor
      Roberts also expanded at the hearing.  If the assertion in the  report
      is right, it would imply that an assessment using the DARLInG database
      would underestimate the age of anybody east of London.

  71. The assertion by Professor Roberts in the  report,  however,  bristles
      with difficulties.  The first  is  that,  both  as  expressed  and  as
      potentially derived from the data cited, it could apply  only  to  the
      attainment of stage H of the lower third molar, which is, in Professor
      Roberts' view, not reliable anyway.  Secondly, the assertion does  not
      even match the available data.  Not only does it ignore the fact  that
      Israel is not east of Kuwait but over a  thousand  kilometres  to  the
      west; it also ignores the data in the paper by Knell and  others,  who
      found, as noted above, that south east Europeans were about six months
      ahead of Swiss.  Thirdly, there does not in any event seem to  be  any
      good reason for supposing that the  relevant  ages  for  Afghan  males
      would  be  something  between  Israelis  and  Koreans:  there  was  no
      ethnological basis  for  such  view  cited  before  me.   It  may  be,
      therefore, that Afghan males obtain dental maturity earlier than those
      in the DARLInG database, or later than Han Chinese: one simply  cannot
      say.  Fourthly, although the influence, if any, of ethnicity is indeed
      said to be genetic, the research giving  rise  to  the  figures  cited
      appears, at least in part, to be derived from populations available in
      the quoted geographical localities, rather than populations  carefully
      sorted by ethnicity.  There is, so far as I am aware, no reason at all
      to suppose that the rate of  tooth  development  is  affected  by  the
      geographical location of the subject.

  72. The figures quoted in Professor Roberts' opinion do  not  support  the
      assertion he makes  immediately  after  quoting  those  figures;  that
      assertion has no other support.  The rate of maturation  of  teeth  in
      the Afghan male is at present a matter on which there are no data  and
      on which there is no proper basis for supposition.  I appreciate that,
      as noted above, there are experts who regard the role of ethnicity  as
      minor.  If they are right, the lack of data for Afghan males  is  much
      less of a problem.  The point here, however, is that Professor Roberts
      is not one of those experts.  He thinks it does make a difference, but
      he is prepared to make what really amount to wild guesses  about  what
      difference.   When he was asked about this at  the  hearing  he  again
      said that you have to work on the data that you have.

  73. Mr  Wise  QC  suggested,  by  his  questions,  that  the  sparsity  of
      information in Professor Roberts' opinions was  deliberately  designed
      to prevent them  being  read  critically  and  therefore  possibly  to
      deceive a reader.  I am not persuaded of that.  It does, however, seem
      to me that Professor Roberts has developed an attitude of omniscience,
      in which he is prepared to assume that what  he  says  goes.   Coupled
      with that,  he  seems  to  be  prepared  to  base  apparently  precise
      assessments on material which simply cannot support those assessments.
       The most alarming example of this in the report under examination  is
      obviously that of tooth wear.  Croydon's assertion that  they  do  not
      rely on tooth wear does not help: the point is that Professor  Roberts
      was prepared to express  this  opinion  in  a  formal  age  assessment
      report.  The difficulties in relation  to  the  other  age  assessment
      methods in the report are more  subtle,  but  they  are  of  the  same
      nature.  In relation to each of the four age assessment methods, there
      was reliance on unreliable data, or failure  to  mention  difficulties
      about use of the data, or both.  In the circumstances I have, with the
      greatest regret, reached the conclusion that  an  assessment  in  this
      form (or anything like it) by Professor Roberts should  be  read  with
      the greatest of caution and should be acted on only if there has  been
      a proper explanation of the basis for the opinions expressed.

   THE DANGERS OF X-RAY TOMOGRAPHY


  74. The exposure of an individual to x-rays during the process  of  making
      the dental tomograph used  in  age  assessment  creates  a  small  but
      measureable risk of the development of cancer.  The risk is  variously
      assessed  and  is  agreed  to  be  comparable  to  that  undergone  in
      international flight.  Although  when  the  present  applications  for
      judicial review were commenced, the applicants invoked the risk as one
      of the reasons for them not to undergo age assessment based on  dental
      tomograph, by the time of the hearing before me it was agreed  between
      the parties that the risks were small and  the  applicants  no  longer
      sought to rely on this argument.


  75. The British Dental Association takes the view that dental  examination
      does not produce an  accurate  assessment  of  age,  and  that  it  is
      unethical to expose an individual to a dental x-ray where there is "no
      direct health benefit".   That  view  is  obviously  entitled  to  the
      highest respect, but in my judgment it is too narrowly based.   First,
      I am satisfied that the information obtained by a dental tomograph may
      in many cases provide some assistance in age assessments: there may be
      other cases in  which  it  provides  information  which  is  virtually
      diagnostic  on  whether  the  individual  has  or  has  not  passed  a
      particular age.  Secondly, the correct assessment of  age  enables  an
      individual to receive the appropriate support when growing up,  to  be
      categorised as ready  or  not  yet  ready  for  work,  to  obtain  the
      appropriate level of benefits, and in all other ways to be treated  in
      an appropriate manner by the society in which he finds himself.  It is
      thus of the very greatest benefit both to the person in  question  and
      to the public as a whole that, where age is disputed, it should be, so
      far as possible, assessed correctly.


  76. Taking all those factors together, it  seems  to  me  that,  generally
      speaking, the invocation of the risk deriving from exposure to  x-rays
      will not be a good reason for an individual whose age is  disputed  to
      refuse to undergo the process leading to the production  of  an  x-ray
      dental tomograph.  There may, of course, be cases where the individual
      can show that, for some special  reason,  the  risk  in  his  case  is
      higher, and that may demand separate consideration.  But there  is  no
      suggestion of that in either of the two applications before me.

   CONCLUSIONS

  77. I draw the following general conclusions about dental  development  as
      an aid to age assessment.


          1) The description of dental maturity by reference to the
             Demirjian stages appears to be widely-used and useful.  It is
             of very limited use for age assessment when all or very nearly
             all teeth have reached stage H and the fact that all teeth have
             reached stage H is not of itself sufficient to be a guide to
             whether a person is or is not over the age of 18.

          2) None of the three Mandibular Maturity Markers described in this
             judgment has yet been sufficiently examined to enable it safely
             to be said that it is diagnostic of age.  Further work is
             needed on the comparability of the data from different studies
             and the causes of the presentation of the markers and their
             independence one of another, as well as a wider range of
             acceptance in the relevant scientific community.

          3) Dental wear may in some circumstances help to establish age but
             only if data for a population with similar diet and chewing
             habits are available.

          4) The relevance of ethnic background to the progress of dental
             maturity is not yet clear.



  78. In that context there is  obviously  room  for  doubt  whether  dental
      evidence should be received in age assessment cases. It  seems  to  me
      that as long as there is no risk of its being over-valued it is or may
      be of use at the present time.  Further, in this very active field  of
      research, it may be that the relevance of  ethnic  background  may  be
      decisively shown to be negligible, which would  enormously  widen  the
      range of reference data available to every investigator.  And  further
      investigation  and  more  published   research   may   establish   the
      reliability of one or more of the Mandibular Maturity Markers.  In the
      mean time, and despite all the reservations, a  dental  tomograph  may
      provide information making  a  claim  extremely  likely  or  extremely
      unlikely, and  may  identify  features  of  assistance  between  those
      extremes.


  79. I therefore offer the following guidance

          1) Evidence obtained by x-ray dental tomography may well be
             relevant to age assessment.

          2) Generally speaking, the danger to an individual arising from
             exposure to x-rays in the tomography process is wholly
             outweighed by the intended benefit of a contribution to the
             evidence used in age assessment.  It is likely to be
             unreasonable for a young person whose age is disputed to refuse
             to undergo the process, or for a refusal to be entered on his
             behalf.  The earlier a tomograph is taken, the more likely it
             is to offer useful information.

          3) Judges should beware of being misled into over-valuing
             statistical evidence in the context of a fact-finding exercise.
              They should bear in mind the risks of error and consider in an
             individual case whether that risk is tolerable. They should be
             prepared to question the assumptions behind statistical
             calculations and ensure that the reference data set is valid
             and that all factors capable of affecting the calculations have
             been taken into account.

          4) Judges should be prepared also to question the basis of
             opinions expressed in a report or opinion.  Opinions sharing
             major features with that examined in the present judgment are
             unlikely to be worthy of reliance, and judges should be wary of
             accepting age assessments that appear to rely extensively on
             the reputation of the author rather than the detail,
             consistency and currency of the data.

  80. Following the hearing Croydon accepted the age claimed by ZM  and  his
      application for Judicial Review was withdrawn by  Consent  Order.  The
      claim by SK continues.
