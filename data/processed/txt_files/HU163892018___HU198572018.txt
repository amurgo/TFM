                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellants born on 10th March 1978 and 1st April 1978  respectively
    are both citizens of Pakistan and are husband and wife.  The Appellants
    had made application on 24th July 2018 for indefinite leave  to  remain
    on the basis of long residence in the UK and the second Appellant leave
    to remain under Appendix FM  and  paragraph  276B  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The Respondent had refused their applications with reference to
    paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.  The Appellants had appealed
    that decision and their appeal was heard by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Phull sitting at Taylor House on 6th December 2018.  The judge
    had allowed the appeals on human rights grounds.  The Respondent sought
    permission to appeal and  permission  was  granted  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on 4th April 2019.  It was said that it was arguable that  the
    judge had failed to give reasons or adequate reasons for accepting  the
    first Appellant's account  as  credible  and  secondly  had  failed  to
    properly apply the decision and reasons in the case of R v Khan  [2018]
    UKUT 00384.  Directions were issued for the Upper Tribunal  to  firstly
    decide whether an error of law had been made by the First-tier Tribunal
    and the matter came before me in accordance with those directions.

Submissions on Behalf of the Respondent

 2. I was referred to the recent decision in  Balajigari  [2019]  EWCA  Civ
    673, in particular paragraphs 40 to 43.  It was further  submitted  the
    judge did not appear to appreciate that there were two separate periods
    of concern  with  respect  to  the  Appellant's  tax  affairs  and  the
    Appellant's evidence that he was depressed because a series  of  deaths
    in his family could not have affected those periods that  predated  the
    deaths.  There was simply an inadequacy of explanation as  to  why  the
    deaths would have impacted on his ability to  deal  with  matters  when
    looking at the proper return  of  chronology  of  the  tax  return  and
    applications.

Submissions on Behalf of the Appellants

 3. It was submitted that it was a high threshold to find an inadequacy  of
    reasons and the judge  had  given  reasons  principally  based  on  the
    Appellant's evidence that his mind was taken with  the  deaths  in  his
    family.  It was further said the judge had provided other factors  that
    he had considered in the Appellants' favour.  In respect of the case of
    Khan it was submitted that was a judicial review case only and that the
    matters referred to in  Khan  as  being  reasons  for  the  arousal  of
    suspicion were only four possible reasons, rather than a checklist.

 4. At the conclusion I reserved my decision to consider the documents  and
    submissions made.  I now provide that decision with my reasons.

Decision and Reasons

 5. The judge set out by way of self-direction the burden and  standard  of
    proof at paragraph 4.  He said "in immigration appeals  the  burden  of
    proof is upon the Appellant and the standard of proof is the balance of
    probabilities".  Whilst that is correct in general terms, in this  type
    of case  where  an  assertion  of  dishonesty  is  being  made  by  the
    Respondent it is a misdirection.  The case of  Balajigari  [2019]  EWCA
    Civ 673 sets out the appropriate position in cases of this nature.   At
    paragraph 43 when reviewing the case of R v Khan [2018]  the  Court  of
    Appeal said

         "We consider (as Martin Spencer J did) that the concept of standard
         of proof is not inappropriate in  the  present  context.   This  is
         because what is being asserted by the Secretary of State is that an
         applicant for ILR has been dishonest.  That is a serious allegation
         carrying with it serious consequences.  Accordingly we  agree  that
         the Secretary of  State  must  be  satisfied  that  dishonesty  has
         occurred the standard of proof being the balance of probability but
         bearing in mind the  serious  nature  of  the  allegation  and  the
         serious  consequences  which  follow  from  such   a   finding   of
         dishonesty".

 6. However whilst the judge did not necessarily direct himself accordingly
    the issue is whether that led to any material error, particularly given
    he found in the Appellants' favour.

 7. The judge properly looked at the explanation provided by the  Appellant
    to see whether the Appellant had been involved in any criminality.   He
    gave reasons why he found on balance that  not  to  be  the  case.   In
    summary at paragraphs 16 to 19 he found  the  Appellant  had  not  been
    dishonest for the following reasons:

      1) He had paid the tax he was told that he owed and had not  seen  the
         final tax return.

      2) Following the 2013 return there had been a number of deaths in  his
         family and he had been grieving.

      3) He only became aware of the  tax  issues  when  he  instructed  his
         lawyers in 2015 to apply for leave to remain.   He  then  submitted
         revised tax returns and paid tax due.

      4) He complained to his accountant.

      5) Unprompted by the Respondent or HMRC he realised the error in  2016
         and rectified it promptly.

 8. The judge further found at paragraph 21 that  the  decision  to  invoke
    paragraph 322(5) was inconsistent with the  Secretary  of  State's  own
    policy guidance dated  11th  January  2018  (quoted  by  the  judge  at
    paragraph 15).  It is difficult to see how the judge  could  find  that
    decision  to  invoke  paragraph  322(5)  by  the   Respondent   to   be
    inconsistent with her own policy.  The  policy  stated  inter  alia  "a
    person does not need to have been convicted of a criminal  offence  for
    this provision to apply".  The judge further had referred at  paragraph
    16 to the case of Khan [2018].  R v Khan at  paragraph  41  had  stated



         "The starting point seems to me that when the  Secretary  of  State
         discovers a significant difference between the income claimed in  a
         previous application for leave to remain and the income declared to
         HMRC she is entitled to draw an inference that  the  Appellant  has
         been deceitful or  dishonest  and  should  be  refused  ILR  within
         paragraph 322(5)".

 9. In this decision the Appellant had in his May 2011 application declared
    a total income of �58,612, including �42,700 from self-employment.   In
    his tax return to HMRC 2010/2011 he claimed to have earned only �12,272
    from self-employment.

10. In his application dated May 2013 he claimed total income  of  �55,922,
    including �22,300 from dividends.  In his tax return for  2012/2013  he
    had declared a total income of �31,000  all  from  PAYE  and  no  self-
    employed income  or  dividends.   Accordingly  there  were  significant
    discrepancies in two tax years, both being years  where  the  Appellant
    made visa applications and as noted by the judge being the  only  years
    the Appellant claimed to have been involved in self-employment.

11. The case of Balajigari (paragraph 106) further notes

         "Each case will depend on its  own  facts  but  where  an  earnings
         discrepancy is relied upon (and  without  changing  the  burden  of
         proof which remains  on  the  Secretary  of  State  so  far  as  an
         allegation that an applicant was  dishonest  is  concerned)  it  is
         unlikely that  a  Tribunal  will  be  prepared  to  accept  a  mere
         assertion  from  an  applicant  or  their   accountant   that   the
         discrepancy  was  simply   a   'mistake'   without   a   full   and
         particularised explanation of what  the  mistake  was  and  how  it
         arose".

12. Leaving aside the judge's misdirection on the burden  and  standard  of
    proof it is clear that he had in mind  R  v  Khan  and  looked  at  the
    explanation provided by the Appellant.  The discrepancies in this  case
    were significant and also covered two separate  tax  periods  and  were
    coincidental with two separate visa applications in those years.  Those
    years also appear to have been the only two years the Appellant claimed
    to be self-employed.  The higher figures given in the visa applications
    gave the Appellant points that allowed him to successfully obtain visas
    he might not otherwise have obtained.  In all those  circumstances  and
    bearing in mind the commentary in Khan and in Balajigari there  was  an
    inadequacy of reasoning provided by the judge.  It was not clear why he
    found deaths in the family which all  postdated  the  tax  returns  and
    relevant  visa  applications  would  have  caused   those   significant
    differences.  There is some inconsistency in his finding  of  when  the
    error was discovered.  At paragraph 17 he appears to accept it  was  in
    2015 when his lawyers were putting together evidence for his  leave  to
    remain application that would require him to disclose previous earnings
    when self-employed; whilst at paragraph 19 he refers to "unprompted  by
    the Respondent or HMRC he realised an error in 2016".   He  appears  to
    accept the explanation that the Appellant relied upon his accountant to
    prepare and file tax returns while silent upon the accountant's  letter
    indicating the Appellant had signed returns before they  were  sent  to
    HMRC and they the accountants  have  followed  normal  procedures.   He
    further found that the Respondent had not followed its own guidance but
    provided no explanation as  to  why  he  found  that  to  be  the  case
    particularly bearing in mind that which was said in Khan  and  referred
    to by the judge within his decision.

13. In summary the judge whilst clearly aware of that case and facts in the
    case that he was deciding did not regrettably provide  an  adequate  or
    consistent explanation  for  his  findings  in  a  case  where  it  was
    incumbent upon the judge to consider whether there had been a full  and
    particularised explanation  provided  by  the  Appellant  and  then  an
    adequacy of reasoning as to why  the  judge  found  in  favour  of  the
    Appellant. That was not adequately done in this case.





Decision

A material error of law was made by the judge in this  case  such  that  the
decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be set aside and made afresh.

No anonymity direction is made.
