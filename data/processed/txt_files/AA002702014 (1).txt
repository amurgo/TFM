                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This was an appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Freer promulgated on 21st February 2014, following a  hearing  at
    Birmingham Sheldon Court on 11th February 2014.  In the  determination,
    the judge dismissed the appeal of the Appellant, who applied  for,  and
    was granted, permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and  thus  the
    matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Afghanistan, and has  a  disputed
    age, which arises on account of his alleging that he was born  on  26th
    November 1996, but it being formally determined  that  he  was  instead
    born on 8th October 1994.  His claim has three aspects.  First, that he
    is entitled to asylum on account  of  his  imputed  political  opinion.
    Second, that he is entitled to humanitarian protection as a  result  of
    the risk of indiscriminate violence in Afghanistan.  Third, that he  is
    entitled to Article 8 right to family and private life in the UK.

The Judge's Findings

 3. This appeal has a tortuous history.  Judge Freer determined the  appeal
    against the background of a previous appeal by Judge Graham,  observing
    that, "as Judge Graham dealt only with an  extremely  narrow  point,  I
    find that I  am  the  first  judge  to  deal  with  all  other  issues"
    (paragraph 4).  The "extremely narrow point" that  is  referred  to  in
    Judge Graham's determination relates to the  finding  by  Judge  Graham
    that Section 55 of the BCIA 2009 was not  properly  considered  so  the
    appeal was allowed to the  very  limited  extent  that  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State should consider Section 55.  (See paragraph 3).

 4. Judge Freer made a number of findings, two of which are  of  particular
    note, and importance in this appeal.  First, Judge Freer dealt with the
    Appellant's asylum claim as follows:

         "The matter went back to the drawing board because  of  Section  55
         point.  I see no evidence that the Respondent (or Judge Graham) has
         ever positively accepted the core account at all.   The  burden  of
         proof  remains  on  the  Appellant  and,  due  to  his  very   poor
         credibility, I find that he does not meet  the  low  threshold  for
         asylum or other claims, as I will go on  to  elaborate"  (paragraph
         50).

    Second, the judge now dealt with the Appellant's claim for humanitarian
    protection, with express regard to the fact that he  was  of  a  tender
    age.  Judge Freer observed that, "the Appellant is now  aged  19  years
    and is not shown to be especially at risk of the factors listed [in  AA
    (unattended children) Afghanistan  CG  [2012]  UKUT  00016],  given  my
    findings on the evidence (see paragraph 64).

 5. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 6. The grounds of  application  state  that  the  expert,  Dr  Birch,  had
    undertaken an age assessment, finding that the Appellant was 14ï¿½  years
    of age, on 26th May 2011, given his date  of  birth  of  26th  November
    1996, and that he had only reached  majority  on  26th  November  2014.
    Therefore, age was clearly an issue.  Judge Freer had  not  dealt  with
    the issue of age at all.  He had simply accepted the age assessment  as
    formally given to him.  Second, the judge had made no  findings  as  to
    the  Respondent  Secretary  of  State's  assertion  of  non-cooperation
    regarding  the  tracing  of  family  members  of   the   Appellant   in
    Afghanistan.  There was evidence in the form of a letter from  the  Red
    Cross, which had rebutted any suggestion that the  Appellant  had  been
    less than compliant in providing information about his  family  members
    in Afghanistan.

 7. On 12th March 2014, permission to appeal was granted.

 8. On 25th March 2014 a Rule 24 response was  entered  by  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State to the  effect  that,  in  this  appeal  their  real
    concerns centre around the age of  the  Appellant,  but  this  was  not
    necessarily material as the evidence before the Respondent led  her  to
    the conclusion that the Appellant was an adult.  Furthermore, the judge
    was entitled to conclude that the Appellant's evidence that  his  uncle
    was a Taliban commander was not credible and that  he  would  not  face
    persecution when returned.

Submissions

 9. At the hearing before me on 9th  May  2014  Mr  Bedford,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Appellant, submitted a skeleton argument, which contained
    four essential points.

10. First, he submitted that Judge Freer was  simply  wrong  to  adopt  the
    reasoning of Judge Graham before him in holding that the  core  account
    of the Appellant had been rejected previously,  because  that  decision
    had been appealed, and comprehensively allowed,  so  that  all  matters
    fell to be re-determined again.  In particular, submitted  Mr  Bedford,
    it was the case that the Respondent's submissions  before  Judge  Freer
    now were such that they needed to be expressly rejected by  the  judge.
    These submissions were that the appellant faced a threat from his uncle
    who was actively looking for him and had influence in Afghanistan, that
    there had been no change in the evidence of the Appellant  since  2011,
    that he was no longer a boy, and that his age should be  considered  as
    it was now (see paragraph 31).  Mr Bedford submitted that the  decision
    letter of 2011 was withdrawn following an appeal.   Therefore,  matters
    fell to be considered afresh by Judge Freer.  The fact that Judge Freer
    stated at paragraph 50 that he would take as  his  starting  point  the
    findings of Judge Graham, were misconceived.

11. Second, the age assessment was contested.  Yet, apart  from  the  judge
    stating at the outset (at paragraph 11) that the Appellant was  "so  it
    is thought, born on 8th October 1994", there was no assessment of  what
    the age of the Appellant was.  This was particularly serious given that
    Dr Birch, the expert, had given a view on  this.   The  Respondent  had
    submitted that the Appellant was 19 years old (see  paragraph  33)  and
    the judge then simply went  on  to  adopt  this  by  holding  that  the
    Appellant was indeed 19 years of age (see paragraph 64).  There was  no
    assessment.

12. Third, there was no assessment of the  Appellant's  evidence  that  his
    parents had died and the Appellant's witness statement in  relation  to
    this was simply not discussed by the judge.

13. Finally, the letter from the Red Cross maintaining that  the  Appellant
    had not been obstructive in relation to the tracing of  his  family  in
    Afghanistan was not addressed by the judge at all.

14. For his part, Mr Smart submitted that he would rely upon  the  Rule  24
    response.  This appeal had a chequered history.  However, there  is  no
    error.  At paragraph 4, Judge Freer had made it clear that Judge Graham
    had determined his appeal on a narrow point alone and that it  fell  to
    Judge Freer now to deal with all the issues.   Therefore,  Judge  Freer
    was clearly aware of the fact that he had to deal with all the  issues.
    Judge Freer then makes his assessment at paragraph 50.  As for the  age
    assessment, the one and a half page  Grounds  of  Appeal  before  Judge
    Freer, running  into  fourteen  paragraphs,  take  no  issue  with  the
    assessment of age at all.   Moreover,  nothing  was  said  about  being
    disadvantaged by the Secretary of State failing to deal with the matter
    early.

15. In reply, Mr Bedford submitted that the Grounds of Appeal before  Judge
    Freer, of fourteen paragraphs, do make the  challenges  that  would  be
    made today, and certainly it was not the case that there  had  been  no
    suggestion  (see  paragraph  8)  that  the  Appellant  had   not   been
    disadvantaged.   Furthermore,  paragraph  13  draws  attention  to  the
    Appellant's witness statement, and this should have led  the  judge  to
    enquire into the witness statement, and consider the  Appellant's  age,
    which was not done.  The plain fact was, that if Dr Burgess' report was
    to be taken at face value, then the  Appellant  was  a  child  when  he
    arrived and is still a child, because  he  only  becomes  an  adult  in
    November 2014.

Error of Law

16. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside that decision.  My  reasons  are  as
    follows.

17. The judge appears to have fallen  into  a  fundamental  error  in  this
    appeal by taking the position, after recognises that this was a  matter
    which "went back to the drawing board because of the Section 55  point"
    following the determination of Judge Graham, but then  observing  that,
    "I see no evidence that the  Respondent  (or  Judge  Graham)  has  ever
    positively accepted the core account at all".  It was for  the  present
    judge to determine the  Appellant's  "core  account  in  terms  of  its
    reliability and veracity.  To suggest that the burden of proof  remains
    on the Appellant "and due to his very poor credibility" that  "he  does
    not meet the low threshold for asylum or other claims"  (paragraph  50)
    is not helpful because the fact that his claim is not accepted  by  the
    Respondent, still requires the judge, as  a  fact-finding  Tribunal  to
    make these findings of fact.  Yet, the findings were not made, save for
    the adoption of the refusal letter.

18. In the same way the  fact  was  that  the  age  of  the  Appellant  was
    contested.  The judge, however, stated that "the Appellant is now  aged
    19 years" (paragraph 64) when discussing the report  of  Dr  Birch  and
    considering where the issue  of  liability  lay.   The  errors  are  so
    fundamental in this respect that there must be a finding of an error of
    law, and the decision should be set aside.

19. I cannot, however,  under  Section  12(2)  of  TCEA  2007,  remake  the
    decision because the evidence has to be reheard  again  in  the  proper
    manner to enable the Appellant to have  the  benefit  of  a  First-tier
    Tribunal ruling in accordance with the Practice Statement 7.2, as there
    has been a failing to accord the Appellant a fair hearing at the First-
    tier Tribunal.

20. Accordingly, whilst I make a finding of an error of law, this matter is
    remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal to be determined again on a de
    novo basis with all issues outstanding.

Decision

21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    allowed to the extent that  it  is  remitted  back  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, to be heard by a judge other than Judge Freer, on all  issues
    on a de novo basis.

22. Anonymity order is made.
