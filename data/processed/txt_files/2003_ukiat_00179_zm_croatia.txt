For the Appellant:           Mr M Malik, instructed by Sutovic and Hartigan
For the Respondent:          Ms J Bracken, Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



  1. This is an appeal from the determination of an  Adjudicator,  Mr  S  S
     Chohan, dated 9th April 2003.  He  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal
     against the refusal of the Respondent to grant him leave to enter  and
     to refuse to grant him asylum.   The  appeal  was  dismissed  on  both
     Refugee Convention and ECHR grounds.

  2. The Appellant is a Serb from Vukovar in Croatia.  He left Croatia with
     his wife, arriving in the United Kingdom on 28th June  1999  where  he
     claimed asylum.  He said that many relatives had been  killed  by  the
     Croatians, that he received constant threatening telephone calls  that
     he would be killed if he did not leave Croatia, that he had fought  in
     the RSK Army and had been harassed by the police.  There was  evidence
     before the Adjudicator to the effect that the family  house  had  been
     badly damaged and that for some time no-one has lived there,  although
     he said that members of his family had lived there for a  while  after
     it had been damaged.  He said he did not have the money to repair  the
     house.  Although there was some confusion about children, it  appeared
     that the Appellant had step-children who lived with his wife's  mother
     in Croatia.

  3. The Adjudicator generally accepted the credibility of the  Appellant's
     account.  He considered  whether  there  would  be  a  sufficiency  of
     protection in Croatia and whether there would be a breach of Article 3
     if the Appellant were to  be  returned  there.   He  referred  to  the
     extensive objective material which  had  been  submitted  and  to  the
     decision of this Tribunal in  S&K  [2002]  UKIAT  05613  Starred,  the
     determination in which was notified  on  3rd  December  2002.   Having
     considered both his own analysis of the background  material  and  the
     decision  in  S&K,  the  Adjudicator  concluded  that  there  were  no
     particular circumstances justifying  a  different  approach  from  the
     general one set out in S&K and accordingly he dismissed the appeal.

  4. There were two grounds of appeal in respect of  which  permission  was
     granted.  The first was that  there  was  a  renewed  application  for
     permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal pending in S&K.   Plainly,
     it was hoped that if the Court of Appeal allowed an appeal in S&K that
     would affect the approach of the Tribunal or Adjudicator on a remittal
     to the situation in Croatia for Serbs.  The second ground  related  to
     Article 8 and contended that leave to appeal should be given,  pending
     the final determination of Ullah [2002] EWCA Civ 1856 in the House  of
     Lords.  In effect, neither of those grounds have been pursued in front
     of us.  The Court of Appeal refused permission to appeal in  S&K,  and
     although Ullah is still pending in the House  of  Lords,  it  was  not
     suggested that that was a reason why this appeal should be allowed.

  5. Additionally, Mr Malik, who appeared  for  the  Appellant,  recognised
     that it was extremely difficult for him to pursue any argument now  in
     relation to this Appellant and the background circumstances in Croatia
     in the light of the further consideration which the Tribunal had given
     to the matter in DK v SSHD [2003] UKIAT 00153K (Croatia).  Although Mr
     Malik did not formally abandon the appeal on those grounds in order to
     retain such further appeal rights as might be open to him, he did  not
     argue them in front of us.  We have considered  the  circumstances  in
     this case nonetheless, but we do not consider in the light of the  two
     decisions to which we have referred and the background  material  that
     there is any basis for allowing the appeal on those grounds.

  6. Mr Malik, however, sought to introduce  a  further  ground  of  appeal
     which bore a very tenuous connection to the Article 8 point raised  in
     the original grounds of appeal.  We gave him permission  to  vary  his
     grounds of appeal by the addition of this third ground.  He  contended
     that it would be a breach of the Appellant's Article 8  rights  and  a
     disproportionate interference with them, notwithstanding the need  for
     consistent and firm immigration  control,  for  the  Appellant  to  be
     returned to Croatia.  He said that the  Appellant  and  his  wife  now
     enjoyed family life within the United Kingdom.  They had done so since
     June 1999, now for some 4� years.  The Respondent had taken  2�  years
     to reach his decision on the asylum application.  Had the  Appellant's
     application been considered within a reasonable time of his arrival in
     the United Kingdom, and it would have  been  reasonable  to  expect  a
     decision within one year, the Appellant would have benefited from  the
     way in which asylum applications from Serbs from  Croatia  were  being
     considered.  Although Mr Malik accepted that he could not  in  reality
     say that there was a policy of granting asylum in 1999 through to June
     2000, nonetheless the odds were that the  decision  taken  within  one
     year of his arrival in the country would have been favourable  to  the
     Appellant, whereas the delayed decision was not.  He accepted that the
     position of the Appellant's wife was dependant  upon  the  Appellant's
     own position and gave rise to no separate consideration.  But Mr Malik
     pointed out that in addition to the interference with their life  here
     if they had to return to  Croatia,  they  would  also  experience  the
     difficulties of life in Croatia in terms of accommodation, employment,
     discrimination and they would have to start from scratch,  whereas  in
     the United Kingdom they had sought  to  work  to  maintain  themselves
     until they were prevented by law from doing so.

  7. Mr Malik referred us to a number of  authorities  in  support  of  his
     propositions.  He relied upon the decision in Shala v SSHD [2003] EWCA
     Civ 233 for  the  proposition,  when  considering  proportionality  in
     Article 8 ECHR, that it was relevant to consider  the  effect  of  the
     time taken by the Secretary of State to reach  his  decision  and  the
     consequences which such a  delay  had  on  the  prospects  of  someone
     receiving the benefit of a policy or exception.   In  that  case,  the
     period between claim and the Respondent's  decision  was  four  years.
     During that period, the Appellant in that  case,  who  was  an  ethnic
     Albanian from Kosovo, had met a Czech national who was also an  asylum
     seeker and they had begun co-habiting.  She and her two sons had  been
     granted refugee status just over a year before the decision in respect
     of that Appellant.  They had been co-habiting for some 2� years before
     the Home Office decision in respect of the Appellant and were  married
     three months after it.  The Appellant's wife had never been to Kosovo,
     spoke no Albanian and she and her sons had been in the United  Kingdom
     for some four years by the time she married the  Appellant.   Had  the
     Appellant's application been dealt with with reasonable promptness, he
     would have been granted refugee status or at least  exceptional  leave
     to remain.  This was described as the Respondent's policy up until the
     middle of 1999, some two years before the decision letter.   He  would
     not then have been required to leave the United Kingdom and  to  apply
     from Kosovo as somebody who merely had temporary admission;  he  would
     have been able to make his application for a variation  in  his  leave
     from within the United Kingdom.  The Court of  Appeal  concluded  that
     the Tribunal ought to have seen the fact that the delay  by  the  Home
     Office in determining his case had deprived him of  the  advantage  of
     making the application for variation in  his  leave  from  within  the
     United Kingdom as an exceptional circumstance, unlike the  normal  run
     of cases where a person with no leave to enter  sought  leave  on  the
     basis of marriage.  It was said to be unfair  that  he  should  suffer
     because of an uncertainty arising from the Home Office failings;  they
     were concerned that allowing him to apply in-country  would  encourage
     others to exploit the established procedures.  However, to require the
     Appellant to leave the United Kingdom and apply from Kosovo  would  be
     clearly disproportionate.  Mr  Malik  said  that  that  general  point
     applied to the circumstances of this Appellant.

  8. Shala had been  applied  in  relation  to  a  case  certified  by  the
     Secretary of State as manifestly unfounded by Moses J in  Ala  v  SSHD
     [2003] EWHC 521 (Admin).  Finally, we were referred to the  fact  that
     Dyson LJ had regarded the Shala point as one which had a real prospect
     of success in granting permission to appeal from  a  decision  of  the
     Tribunal in another case.  We were shown the skeleton  argument  which
     had persuaded him to grant permission on paper.   What  was  submitted
     was that the decision on the claim in  that  case  had  been  delayed,
     there had been a change in circumstances and had the case been decided
     by the Secretary of State within  a  reasonable  time,  the  Appellant
     would have been granted refugee status and it was disproportionate  to
     require the Appellant to be returned.  As to the latter case, we  find
     no assistance in a skeleton argument  and  a  short  comment  granting
     permission.  It carries no authority beyond to suggest that the  point
     was seen as arguable.  We are not considering  whether  this  case  is
     arguable.  We are considering what  the  decision  in  it  should  be.
     Insufficient facts have been provided about that third  case  for  any
     parallels to be drawn in any event.

  9. Mr Malik also submitted that the references  in  R  v  SSHD  ex  parte
     Mahmood [2000] EWCA Civ 315, to the removal of one family member  from
     a state where other members of the family are  lawfully  resident  not
     necessarily  infringing  Article  8  "provided  that  there   are   no
     insurmountable obstacles to the family living together in the  country
     of origin of the family member excluded" (para 55(3) per Lord Phillips
     MR), had been taken as imposing a  test  that  was  harsher  than  was
     intended.  It did not require the difficulties to be  such  that  they
     were simply incapable of being overcome.   They  covered  difficulties
     which should not have to be overcome, even though it might be possible
     at some significant cost to do so.

 10. We do not accept these submissions.  First, there was no group  policy
     towards Serbian asylum seekers from Croatia in 1999 and each case  had
     to be determined on its own merit, as the then advice  to  caseworkers
     showed in Bulletin 2 and 4 of 1999.  There was no more than a  general
     presumption that Serbs from certain identified war-affected areas "may
     be able to substantiate a claim to asylum  on  the  grounds  of  their
     ethnicity".

 11. Second, there would be no significant  interference  with  private  or
     family life if the Appellant and his wife were  returned  to  Croatia.
     They were married before they arrived in the United Kingdom;  both are
     of the same nationality;  there is nothing from the Appellant's wife's
     circumstances which gives  rise  to  any  separate  considerations  of
     asylum or human rights because her position is entirely  dependant  on
     his, as Mr Malik accepted.  There are no  insurmountable  barriers  to
     the return of any family member, therefore, however much  the  bar  is
     lowered by the Appellant's submissions.  There is no more interference
     here than is involved in the impact of  the  removal  itself  and  the
     undoubted hardships which would be faced on  return  to  Croatia.   We
     recognise those difficulties and the feeling of  stability  gained  in
     the United Kingdom through their time here.  However, we do not regard
     that as a significant interference with their private or family life.

 12. The Appellant's position is no different from the many  failed  asylum
     seekers whose cases have been dealt with too  slowly  in  a  congested
     decision-making system, and in respect  of  which  circumstances  have
     changed in their country of nationality or habitual  residence  during
     that process.  Indeed, the Refugee Convention itself  recognises  that
     even if someone had been granted refugee status, changed circumstances
     permit the return of refugees conformably with the Convention.  We  do
     not say that the delay in the decision-making process  is  irrelevant,
     and we recognise that had  the  claim  been  dealt  with  rather  more
     expeditiously, there is a real likelihood that  either  indefinite  or
     exceptional leave to remain would have been granted.  However, we  see
     nothing disproportionate in relation to  the  degree  of  interference
     with the Appellant's private or family life with the return of him and
     his wife to Croatia  for  all  its  hardships.   They  will  still  be
     together as a couple.  They can be reunited with the children  of  the
     family in Croatia and with the Appellant's  wife's  parents,  who  are
     also in Croatia.  Their personal links in  this  country  are  to  the
     friends whom they have made  in  their  time  here.   The  Appellant's
     family, except for his wife and her children, have been killed.

 13. This case is very different from both Shala and Ala.   In  Shala,  the
     private or family life relied on had  only  become  established  as  a
     result of the time spent by the Appellant in this country when he  met
     someone here;  not so here.  That person and her children had  refugee
     status;  not so here.  He was a Kosovan, but his wife and her children
     were Czechs and had no connection with Kosovo;   very  different  from
     here.  The issue was whether the family should be split  up  while  he
     alone went to Kosovo to apply  for  entry  clearance,  an  application
     quite likely to be granted, in circumstances where had his application
     for asylum been dealt with reasonably quickly he would have been  able
     to make an in-country application for variation  of  leave.   That  is
     wholly   different   in   the   degree   of   interference   and   the
     disproportionate nature of the consequences of delay as the  Secretary
     of State would have had it.

 14. Again in Ala, the circumstances were different.   The  Kosovan  asylum
     seeker whose case, determined in time, would probably have led to some
     form of leave to remain, married a British citizen with a  child  whom
     he met here.  Before the Secretary of State's decision on  his  claim,
     they also had a child of their own.  Again,  the  Secretary  of  State
     required him to leave the United Kingdom so as  to  apply  abroad  for
     entry clearance.   The  degree  of  interference  was  obviously  very
     significantly greater and the object being achieved by  requiring  the
     departure less clear from the immigration control point  of  view  as,
     like Shala, the Secretary of State was not so much concerned with  the
     position of the  particular  family  but  more  with  maintaining  the
     integrity of the entry clearance system and discouraging  others  from
     jumping the queue.  It is to be remembered also that the actual  issue
     in that case was only whether the Secretary of State's approach to  or
     ignoring of delay in the decision-making process in relation to Kosovo
     made his certifying  of  the  asylum  claim  as  manifestly  unfounded
     unlawful, rather than any ultimate decision on his claim.

 15. The degree of interference in those cases was  markedly  greater  than
     that involved here because each case involved the splitting up of  the
     family, even if only for a temporary  period.   That  does  not  arise
     here.  The family would  be  reunited  with  their  children  if  they
     returned to Croatia.  The object of removal in those cases was also of
     less importance for immigration control. It was expected in both cases
     that entry clearance would be  granted  and  so  the  purpose  of  the
     removal was not to exclude the Appellants from the United Kingdom, but
     to require them to go through the required procedures for the purposes
     of maintaining the integrity of the system without regard  in  reality
     to the particular needs of the family in question.  Here,  the  family
     would not be split up:  indeed, it would be closer to being united and
     the purpose of the enforcement of  immigration  control  here  is  not
     merely to inflict on a family  the  procedural  requirements  for  the
     maintenance of an effective immigration control  system,  which  arise
     only because of that same system's earlier failings.

 16. The question of whether the delay in the decision-making process  made
     the Secretary of State's decision disproportionate was not  considered
     by him.  It does not appear to have been raised for his consideration.
      It was not suggested by any party that the matter should be sent back
     in order for his views on the matter to  be  obtained,  leading  to  a
     further round of decision-making.  It is not  for  us  to  attempt  to
     anticipate or guess at what his views might be:  it is for us to reach
     a conclusion as to whether removal would be proportionate here.

 17. For the reasons which we have given, we do not consider  that  removal
     would be disproportionate notwithstanding the delay in  the  decision-
     making process and accordingly this appeal is dismissed.
