                                  Anonymity

I make an order under r.14(1) of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008 prohibiting the disclosure or publication of  any  matter  likely
to lead members of the public to identify the original appellant. No  report
of these proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  him.   This
direction applies to both the appellant and to the respondent and all  other
persons. Failure to comply with this direction could  lead  to  contempt  of
court proceedings.
I make this anonymity direction because the decision refers to the  original
appellant's minor daughter.
The parties at liberty to apply to discharge this order, with reasons.


Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr D Clarke, Senior Presenting Officer.
For the respondent:    Ms C Bayati, of Counsel, instructed by Appleby Shaw
Solicitors.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

A. INTRODUCTION

 1. I shall refer to Mr A S hereafter as the "claimant". The claimant is  a
    national of Albania born on 3 July 1984.

 2. The Secretary of State was granted permission to appeal the decision of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal D A Thomas (hereafter the "judge") who
    allowed the claimant's appeal  on  human  rights  grounds  (Article  8)
    against the Secretary of State's decision of 31 January 2018 to  refuse
    his human rights claim[1] of 23 August 2016 in which he relied upon his
    right to his family life,  said  to  have  been  established  with  his
    partner ("SC") and his daughter ("SS") by SC born on 26 May  2016,  and
    his right to his private life  in  the  United  Kingdom.  In  the  same
    decision letter, the Secretary of State  also  refused  to  revoke  (or
    purported to refuse to revoke) a deportation  order  made  against  the
    claimant on 8 January 2010.

 3. The Secretary of State's appeal was heard in the Upper Tribunal  on  22
    January 2019 before Lord Beckett sitting as an Upper Tribunal Judge and
    Upper Tribunal Judge Gill (hereafter the "panel"). At the hearing on 22
    January  2019  (the  "EOL  hearing"),  the  Secretary  of   State   was
    represented by Mr D Clarke and the claimant was  represented  by  Mr  A
    Metzer QC.

 4. By a decision (with directions) sent to the parties on 25 January  2019
    (hereafter the "EOL decision"), the panel set  aside  the  decision  of
    Judge Thomas. The reasons for the decision and the directions given  by
    the panel are set out in the EOL decision and summarised below.

 5. The "resumed  hearing",  in  order  to  re-make  the  decision  on  the
    claimant's appeal against the respondent's decision of 31 January 2018,
    was first listed before me on 9 April 2019. On that date, I heard  oral
    evidence from  three  witnesses,  summarised  below.  The  hearing  was
    adjourned part-heard and re-listed to be heard on 30 July 2019.

 6. In her skeleton argument for the hearing on 9 April  2019  (the  "April
    2019 skeleton argument"), Ms Bayati raised new issues on the claimant's
    behalf, for the first time. Following the adjournment on 9 April  2019,
    the claimant made an application, on 10 June 2019,  for  permission  to
    raise an additional ground of appeal (in fact there was more  than  one
    ground) which  included  an  issue  as  to  jurisdiction  and,  in  the
    alternative, legality of the decision. In a nutshell, the submission is
    that there was no power in  law  to  make  the  deportation  order  and
    therefore the decision to refuse to revoke the deportation order was  a
    nullity. There was therefore no jurisdiction for the Upper Tribunal  to
    hear this appeal.

 7. In the April 2019 skeleton argument and in her  skeleton  argument  for
    the hearing on 30 July 2019 (the "July  2019  skeleton  argument"),  Ms
    Bayati also contended that, in the event that I decided that there  was
    an appeal before  the  Upper  Tribunal,   s.117C  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the "2002 Act") and paras 362-399A  of
    the Immigration Rules do not apply to the assessment of the  claimant's
    human rights claim, although she accepted that the  claimant  satisfied
    the definition of "foreign criminal" in s.117D(2).

 8. Accordingly, Ms Bayati contended that s.117A-B of the 2002 Act and para
    276ADE,  Appendix  FM  and  Exception  EX.1.  of  Appendix  FM  in  the
    Immigration Rules apply  instead  in  assessing  the  claimant's  human
    rights claim. This argument was  not  raised  before  Judge  Thomas  or
    before the panel at the EOL hearing.

 9. In the event that I decided that s.117C of the 2002 Act and paras  362-
    399A of the Immigration Rules apply, the issues between the parties are
    as follows:

    (i)    whether the requirement in para  399(b)(i)  of  the  Immigration
         Rules, that the relationship between a  deportee  and  his  or  her
         partner must have been formed at a time when the  deportee  was  in
         the United Kingdom lawfully, applies so as to preclude the claimant
         from relying upon s.117C(5) of the 2002  Act  notwithstanding  that
         s.117C(5) makes no mention of the requirement.

    (ii)   whether it is unduly harsh for SS and (if the  claimant  is  not
         precluded from relying on s.117C(5)) for SC to live in  the  United
         Kingdom without the claimant.

         Mr Clarke said that he accepted that it would be  unduly  harsh  to
         expect SC and SS to live in Albania.

    (iii)  if the answers to questions (i) and (ii) are 'No', then  whether
         there are  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those
         described in paras 399 and 399A  or  the  exceptions  mentioned  in
         s.117C(5) of the 2002 Act.

10. In the event that I decided that s.117C of the 2002 Act and paras  362-
    399A of the Immigration Rules do not apply, Mr Clarke conceded, in view
    of the findings of fact that were preserved in the EOL  decision,  that
    the claimant has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with SS
    who is a qualifying child and that it would not be reasonable to expect
    SS to leave the United Kingdom. In such event,  the  claimant's  appeal
    would be allowed with reference to.117B(6) of the  2002  Act  and  para
    399(a).

11. At the hearing on 9 April 2019 and on 30 July 2019, I made it clear  to
    the parties that I  would  hear  submissions  on  the  application  for
    permission to raise additional grounds of appeal de bene esse.

12. Annex A to this decision sets  out  ss.117A-D  of  the  2002  Act,  the
    Immigration Rules relating to deportation  and  the  Immigration  Rules
    relating to non-deportation cases. Annex B is the EOL decision.



B. BACKGROUND

13. The claimant first arrived in the United Kingdom on 15  July  2005.  He
    claimed asylum on 21 July 2005 in a false  name  and  falsely  claiming
    that his date of birth was 1 July 1989. He was in fact already 21 years
    old on arrival. His asylum claim was refused. Believing  him  to  be  a
    minor, the Secretary of State granted the claimant discretionary  leave
    to remain (DLR) until 9 September 2006.

14. On 12 September 2006, the claimant made an application  to  extend  his
    leave. However, on 17 October 2006, he  was  sentenced  to  12  months'
    Detention and  Training  Order  ("DTO")  following  his  conviction  at
    Channel  Juvenile  Court  of  an  offence  of  possession  of  a  false
    instrument.

15. On 15 March 2007 (hereafter the "March 2007  decision"),  the  claimant
    was notified of the Secretary of State's decision to make a deportation
    order against him. This decision conferred a right of appeal which  the
    claimant duly exercised (appeal reference: IA/04663/2007).

16. The claimant in appeal number: IA/04663/2007 is BS with a date of birth
    of 1 July 1989. The claimant's appeal was first listed for  hearing  in
    the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal ("AIT") on 2 May 2007 but adjourned
    on 30 April 2007. It was then re-listed to be heard on 18 May 2007.

17. The decision letter dated 31 January  2018  states  that  the  claimant
    withdrew his appeal on 21 May 2007, which the  claimant  disputes.  The
    claimant contends that the Secretary of State withdrew the decision  at
    the   hearing   on   18   May   2007.   This   is   relevant   to   the
    jurisdiction/legality issue.

18. The claimant was released from the DTO on 17 March 2007. On 18  January
    2008, he was listed as an absconder. On  1  December  2009,  the  Dutch
    authorities informed the Home Office that the claimant was  being  held
    in  prison  in  the  Netherlands  until  January  2010  following   his
    conviction for using a false passport in respect of which he received a
    sentence of 14 months' imprisonment.

19. On 8 January 2010, the claimant returned to the United Kingdom and  was
    detained. On the same date, the deportation order was signed.

20. The chronology in the decision letter dated 31 January 2018 states that
    the claimant was deported to Albania on 10 February 2010  although  the
    claimant states that he returned to Albania voluntarily.

21. In his application of 23 August 2016 for leave to remain on  the  basis
    of his rights under Article 8, the claimant admitted that he re-entered
    the United Kingdom illegally in July 2010.

22. The claimant met SC in July 2011. They started living together in  July
    2013.



C. THE EOL DECISION

23. The EOL decision may be summarised as follows:

    (i)    The panel concluded (ground 1),  and  as  was  conceded  on  the
         claimant's behalf, that the judge had erred in law  in  failing  to
         treat the claimant as a "foreign criminal" as defined in  s.117D(2)
         of the 2002 Act.

    (ii)   The panel concluded that the error was material as it was  clear
         that the judge had considered the claimant's Article 8 claim  in  a
         freestanding way (para 43 of the EOL decision) wholly uninformed by
         the weight that is accorded to the public interest  in  deportation
         by the creation of the scheme in paras 398, 399  and  399A  of  the
         Immigration Rules which provided for the two exceptions in para 399
         and para 399A and the proviso in para 398 of the Immigration  Rules
         (para 45 of the EOL decision).

    (iii)  In addition (ground 2), the judge had materially erred in law by
         failing to give adequate reasons for her finding that  family  life
         could not continue in Albania (paras 52-53 of the EOL decision).

    (iv)   Finally, the judge had erred in law by taking  into  account  in
         the claimant's favour the fact that he can speak English,  as  this
         was a neutral factor pursuant to Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803.  The
         panel considered that, whilst this error may not have been material
         to the outcome, it added to  the  already  determinative  case  for
         setting aside the judge's decision (para 55 of the EOL decision).

24. The panel directed that the decision on the claimant's  appeal  be  re-
    made in the Upper Tribunal and further issued the following  directions
    (para 58 of the EOL decision):

    (i)    The judge's summary of the evidence she heard at  paras  5-9  of
         her decision to stand as a record of  the  evidence  given  to  the
         First-tier Tribunal (the "FtT").

    (ii)   The following findings to stand, as Mr Metzer had submitted:

         a) at para 23, that the  claimant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
             relationship with SC and SS; and

         b) at para 24, the findings made by the judge as follows:

                  "... Despite her age, [SS]  will  be  familiar  with  [the
                  claimant] as her father. She has a real relationship  with
                  her maternal grandparents who are settled in the UK. As  a
                  British citizen  she  is  entitled  to  the  benefits  and
                  entitlements of her nationality. Her  best  interests  are
                  served with her remaining in the care of both  parents  in
                  the UK".



D. THE APPLICATION FOR PERMISSION TO AMEND THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL

(i) Evidence before me concerning the "withdrawal"

25. As stated above, the decision letter dated 31 January 2018 states  that
    the claimant withdrew his appeal against the March 2007 decision  which
    the claimant disputes. In this regard:

    (i)    Para 6 of the claimant's skeleton argument dated 12 August 2018,
         from Mr S Muquit, of Counsel, that was before Judge  Thomas  stated
         that it was not clear what had happened to the claimant's appeal of
         2007  and  that  evidence  disclosed  as  part  of  a  "Freedom  of
         Information" ("FOI") request suggests that "no  final  outcome  was
         entered on CID".

    (ii)   Para 2 of the April  2019  skeleton  argument  states  that  the
         claimant claimed that his appeal was successful, that there was  no
         determination or notice from the AIT and that the  minutes  of  the
         Home Office in this regard were unclear and inconsistent, it  being
         stated in one minute that the appeal was withdrawn by the  claimant
         and in another that it was accepted that he was a minor.

    (iii)  By two emails of the same date (3 April  2019),  the  claimant's
         representatives (Appleby Shaw Solicitors) requested the FtT  for  a
         copy of  the  determination  in  the  claimant's  appeal.  No  such
         determination had been received by the date of the  hearing  before
         me on 9 April 2019. Following  the  adjournment  of  that  hearing,
         Appleby Shaw Solicitors sent to the Upper Tribunal by  email  dated
         17 April 2019 the following documents:

         (a)      The manuscript Record of Proceedings of Immigration  Judge
             Mayall dated 18 May 2007 which states:

                  "H.O. wdrew the decision.

                  Decision withdrawn"

         (b)      A "Notice of Decision" under document reference AIT70 (the
             "AIT70 Notice"). This is a  pro-forma  document  with  various
             options. The following boxes were ticked:

                  The Appellant has withdrawn the appeal by notice

                      Orally before the Tribunal on 18 May, 2007

                  The Respondent has withdrawn the original decision(s)

26. At para 13 of her July 2019 skeleton argument, Ms Bayati  submits  that
    the AIT70 Notice shows that the claimant  withdrew  his  appeal  orally
    because the Secretary of State had withdrawn his decision.

(ii) The jurisdiction/legality issue - the parties' submissions

27. The claimant's case on  the  jurisdiction  or  legality  issue  may  be
    summarised as follows:

28. The March 2007 decision was a decision  to  make  a  deportation  order
    under s.3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971 (the  "1971  Act")  on  the
    ground that the claimant's deportation  was  conducive  to  the  public
    good. The claimant had a right of appeal pursuant to s.82(1)(j) of  the
    2002 Act as it was then in force. The claimant exercised his  right  of
    appeal.  The  Secretary  of  State  could  only  proceed  to  issue   a
    deportation order if the March  2007  decision  was  either  upheld  on
    appeal or not appealed.

29. The effect of the withdrawal by the Secretary of  State  of  the  March
    2007 decision was that there was  no  power  to  make  the  deportation
    order. The deportation order dated  8  January  2010  was  therefore  a
    nullity. Since it was a nullity, there was no need to set it  aside  or
    to quash it. Given that  the  deportation  order  was  a  nullity,  the
    refusal to revoke the deportation order was also  a  nullity.  In  this
    regard, Ms Bayati relied upon paras 33-43 of  the  decision  of  Jeremy
    Baker J in R (Pryor) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 2853 and  paras  93-94  of  the
    decision of Hayden J in R (Sino) v SSHD [2015] EWHC 1831.

30. Furthermore, the refusal of the claimant's human rights claim was  also
    a nullity for the following reasons:

    (i)    As there was only one decision made on 31 January  2018  and  as
         the decision to refuse  to  revoke  the  deportation  order  was  a
         nullity, the refusal of the claimant's human rights claim was  also
         a nullity.

    (ii)   In the alternative, the refusal of the claimant's  human  rights
         claim was a nullity because it was inextricably tied  up  with  the
         refusal to revoke the deportation order so that they stand or  fall
         together. His human rights claim was considered on the  basis  that
         he was the subject of deportation action and  a  foreign  criminal.
         Both the starting point and the  end  point  of  the  Secretary  of
         State's consideration  of  the  claimant's  Article  8  claim  were
         incorrect. The entire assessment of  the  claimant's  human  rights
         claim was made on the basis that it was  conducive  to  the  public
         good to deport him and was therefore  fundamentally  flawed  and  a
         nullity.

    (iii)  In the  further  alternative,  the  human  rights  decision  was
         unlawful or perverse because the assessment of proportionality  was
         based on the claimant's case being one which  concerned  revocation
         of a deportation order.

31. There was therefore no appeal before the FtT or the Upper Tribunal.

32. The fact that the jurisdiction issue was being raised late  was  not  a
    bar because the Upper Tribunal either has jurisdiction or it does  not.
    It was therefore irrelevant that the claimant was taking issue with the
    legality of the deportation order 9 years after it was made.

33. In the alternative, the decision to refuse to  revoke  the  deportation
    order was unlawful.  This  is  because  the  March  2007  decision  was
    withdrawn and therefore the deportation order was unlawful. An unlawful
    decision is a valid decision until set aside, whereas a  decision  that
    is a nullity has no legal effect.

34. Any issue as to timeliness in  relation  to  the  submission  that  the
    refusal to revoke the deportation order was unlawful should not be held
    against the claimant for the following reasons: Until  16  April  2019,
    the claimant did not know the  outcome  of  the  hearing  before  Judge
    Mayall on 18 May 2007. Ms Bayati submitted that it only became clear in
    April 2019 that the deportation order made in 2010  was  defective.  in
    any event, he was in detention in 2010 and then subsequently removed.

35. At paras 9-11 of her July 2019 skeleton  argument,  Ms  Bayati  accepts
    that the Upper Tribunal has no power to allow an appeal on  the  ground
    that the decision is not in  accordance  with  the  law.  However,  she
    submits that the question whether a decision is in accordance with  the
    law is highly relevant to  the  claimant's  human  rights  claim  under
    Article 8.

36. In response, Mr Clarke submitted that the distinction sought to be made
    between a decision that is a  nullity  and  an  unlawful  decision  was
    wrong. The July 2019 skeleton argument contends that the decision dated
    31 January 2018 was a nullity because it was unlawful  under  the  1971
    Act. He submitted that the claimant was requesting me to set aside  two
    decisions, i.e. the deportation order and the refusal of the claimant's
    human rights claim in the decision letter dated  31  January  2018.  He
    referred me to the Court of Appeal's decision in MS  (Pakistan)  [2018]
    EWCA Civ 594 which considered whether an indirect  challenge  could  be
    made on an appeal to the legality of a "Conclusive Grounds" decision by
    the Competent Authority which did not attract a  right  of  appeal  but
    which could only be  challenged  by  judicial  review  proceedings.  He
    submitted that it was not open to me to declare the  deportation  order
    and/or the refusal to revoke the deportation order a nullity.

37. Although Mr Clarke accepted that it was necessary for  there  to  be  a
    lawful decision to make a deportation order in order for there to be  a
    lawful deportation order, he submitted that, pursuant to MS (Pakistan),
    it was  not  possible  for  me  to  go  behind  or  "step  around"  the
    deportation order or the refusal to revoke the deportation order unless
    the claimant is able to show that the decision in question was perverse
    or irrational. In this regard, he drew my attention to the  fact  that,
    when the claimant was returned to the United Kingdom in January 2010, a
    new factual matrix arose. His  true  date  of  birth  was  known  then,
    whereas he was assumed to be a child at the date when  the  March  2007
    was said to have been withdrawn. As at the date of the  hearing  before
    Judge Mayall in May 2007, he was 18 years old on his  assumed  date  of
    birth and therefore would not have qualified for  a  deportation  order
    under the UK Borders Act 2007 which came into effect five months later.
    By January 2010, he was recognised to be an adult. Mr Clarke  submitted
    that the claimant should not be allowed to benefit  from  the  lies  he
    told about his identity and his date of birth.

38. In response, Ms Bayati submitted that the reason why the  Secretary  of
    State withdrew the March 2007 decision was irrelevant. The fact of  the
    withdrawal meant that there was no power in law to issue a  deportation
    order. She submitted that, in any event,  it  was  not  known  why  the
    Secretary of State withdrew the March 2007 decision.

(iii) The jurisdiction/legality issue - assessment

39. The relevant parts of the decision letter dated 31 January 2018 are  as
    follows:

    (i)    The decision letter begins as follows:

             "Home Office

             Notice of decision

             In compliance with the Immigration (Notices) Regulations  2003
             made under section 105 of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
             Asylum Act 2002

             ...

             Thank you for your letter of 5 August 2016 in which  you  made
             further submissions about your  deportation  from  the  UK  in
             which you claim that your deportation would  breach  the  UK's
             obligations under the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights
             (ECHR)."

    (ii)   There is then a heading entitled  "Article  8  ECHR"  the  first
         paragraph of which quotes in full the content  of  Article  8.  The
         next paragraph then reads:

             "The Immigration Rules at paragraph A362 and  paragraphs  A398
             to 399D set out the  practice  to  be  followed  by  officials
             acting on behalf of the Secretary of State when considering an
             Article 8 claim from a person liable  to  deportation  on  the
             basis   of   criminal   convictions.   These   rules   reflect
             Parliament's view of what the public interest requires for the
             purposes of Article 8(2). Parliament's  view  is  set  out  at
             sections  117A  to  117D  in  Part  5A  of  the   Nationality,
             Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  (as   inserted   by   the
             Immigration Act 2014)."

    (iii)  The Secretary of State then  considered  the  claimant's  family
         life claim followed by his private life  claim  and  whether  there
         were very compelling circumstances over and above  those  described
         in paras 399 and 399A. Paras 390 and  390A  were  then  considered,
         following which there is this paragraph in the decision letter:

             "Decision

             Your further submissions have been fully considered but I have
             concluded for the reasons explained  above  that  you  do  not
             qualify for leave to enter or remain in the UK on any basis.

             I have further concluded for the reasons explained above  that
             there are no grounds  on  which  to  revoke  your  deportation
             order."

40. Ms Bayati did not contend that the decision  letter  dated  31  January
    2018 did not refuse the claimant's human rights claim. In essence,  she
    submits that the decision letter dated 31 January 2018 was  one  single
    indivisible decision that did two things, i.e. refused  to  revoke  the
    deportation order and refused the claimant's human rights claim.  Since
    it was indivisible (in her submission), the two aspects of the decision
    stand or fall together in her submission.

41. In my view, it is plain from the decision letter dated 31 January  2018
    that the main part of the decision letter comprised of the  refusal  of
    the claimant's human rights claim. It is clear from the very  beginning
    of the letter that the Secretary of State was addressing the claimant's
    human rights claim and that, having reached the conclusion  that  there
    would be no breach of the claimant's human rights claim,  the  decision
    was made to refuse to revoke the deportation order. Thus, if Ms  Bayati
    is correct, that the decision letter was one indivisible decision  such
    that the two aspects of  it  stand  or  fall  together,  I  would  have
    concluded that this was principally a decision to refuse the claimant's
    human rights claim and that  the  decision  to  refuse  to  revoke  the
    deportation order was made because it was decided that  the  claimant's
    human rights claim fell for refusal.

42. However, I  do  not  accept  that  the  decision  was  one  indivisible
    decision. In my judgement, it is clear that there were  two  decisions;
    namely, a decision to refuse the claimant's human rights  claim  of  23
    August 2016 and a decision to refuse to revoke  the  deportation  order
    made on 8 January 2010.

43. I take support from the fact that a similar situation  arose  in  Smith
    (appealable decisions; PTA requirements; anonymity) [2019]  UKUT  00216
    (IAC) (Lane J  as  President,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Gill  and  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Finch). The decision letter in that  case  comprised  of
    two separate decisions; namely,  a  decision  to  refuse  to  revoke  a
    deportation order and a decision to refuse the claimant's human  rights
    claim (para 39). The Upper Tribunal decided that the claimant  in  that
    appeal was entitled, through the mechanism of the human rights  appeal,
    to contend that his removal would violate Article 8 although he had  no
    in-country  right  of  appeal  against  the  refusal  to   revoke   the
    deportation order

44. In her submissions, Ms Bayati stressed the fact that only one  decision
    was issued. I cannot see why it should make a  difference  whether  the
    refusal of the claimant's human rights claim and the refusal to  revoke
    the deportation order were notified in separate decision letters or  in
    the same decision letter. To the contrary, it makes sense for  the  two
    decisions to be notified in the same decision letter  in  view  of  the
    fact that the refusal to revoke the deportation order followed from the
    Secretary of State's consideration of the claimant's circumstances  and
    the decision to refuse his human rights claim.

45. I do not accept that the two decisions in the  instant  appeal  are  so
    inextricably linked that they stand or fall together. It is  true  that
    the decision to refuse  to  revoke  the  deportation  order  was  taken
    because of the negative  conclusion  on  the  claimant's  human  rights
    claim. They were therefore linked in that sense. However,  the  alleged
    illegality in the decision to refuse to revoke  the  deportation  order
    arises because it is said that there was no lawful deportation order. I
    can see no reason in law why any such defect in the refusal  to  revoke
    the deportation order should be regarded  as  fatally  'infecting'  the
    refusal of the human rights claim.

46. Ms Bayati's fallback submission was that the human rights decision  was
    unlawful or perverse because  the  assessment  of  proportionality  was
    based on the claimant's case being one which concerned  the  revocation
    of a deportation order. In other words, it is submitted that  the  fact
    that the Secretary of State considered the human rights  claim  against
    the wrong framework in assessing proportionality, that is, by  applying
    s.117C as opposed to s.117B of the 2002 Act, has the  effect  that  the
    refusal of the  human  rights  claim  is  unlawful  or  perverse.  This
    submission ignores the fact that the Upper Tribunal is bound to  assess
    proportionality  for  itself  when  re-making  the  decision   on   the
    claimant's appeal. It is simply not  open  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  to
    decide a statutory appeal by declaring that the decision to refuse  the
    human rights claim was unlawful or perverse because the proportionality
    assessment by the Secretary of State was incorrectly made  against  the
    framework in s.117C.

47. The Tribunal's jurisdiction is founded upon whether there was a refusal
    of a human rights claim that has not been certified  or  refused  under
    para 353 of the Immigration  Rules  and  whether  an  appeal  has  been
    brought on human rights grounds. Section 86 of the 2002 Act provides:

         86 Determination of appeal

         (1)      This section applies on an appeal under section 82(1).

         (2)      The Tribunal must determine-

             (a) any matter raised as a ground of appeal, and

             (b) ...

48. As the decision letter dated  31  January  2018  did  not  certify  the
    claimant's human rights claim and his claim was not refused under  para
    353 of the Immigration Rules, the claimant had a right  of  appeal.  He
    exercised that right of appeal. He did bring an appeal on human  rights
    grounds. Ms Bayati's application for permission to amend the grounds of
    appeal did not withdraw the human rights ground of appeal. The Tribunal
    must  therefore  determine  his  human  rights  claim  as  mandated  by
    s.86(2)(a).

49. There is therefore an appeal before the Upper Tribunal on human  rights
    grounds. The Tribunal  therefore  has  jurisdiction,  for  all  of  the
    reasons given above.

50. The Tribunal has jurisdiction whether or not the deportation order  was
    a nullity or unlawful or perverse or irrational and whether or not  the
    refusal to revoke the deportation order was a nullity  or  unlawful  or
    perverse or irrational. There is therefore  no  need  to  decide  these
    issues or whether there was power in law to make the deportation  order
    decision of 8 January 2010 in order to decide the jurisdiction issue. I
    have therefore not found it necessary to deal  with  the  decisions  in
    Pryor or Sino or MS (Pakistan) although  I  have  read  and  considered
    them.

51. This is a convenient point at which to deal with Ms Bayati's submission
    that, although the Tribunal has no power to  allow  an  appeal  on  the
    ground that the decision is  not  in  accordance  with  the  law,  this
    remains highly relevant to the claimant's human rights claim. Ms Bayati
    did not develop this submission further. It is clear, however, that  Ms
    Bayati's submission concerns the legality of the refusal to revoke  the
    deportation order.

52. This submission relates to the third step  of  the  five-step  approach
    explained by Lord Bingham at para 17 of R (Razgar) v SSHD  [2004]  UKHL
    27, i.e. that any interference must be  in  accordance  with  the  law.
    However, whilst Ms Bayati's submission concerns the refusal  to  revoke
    the deportation order, the third step  of  the  five-step  approach  in
    Razgar concerns the decision to  refuse  the  claimant's  human  rights
    claim. In view of my decision that the two are separate decisions, I am
    satisfied that the interference is in accordance with the law  for  the
    purposes of the third step.

53. I have not  found  it  necessary  to  take  into  account  whether  the
    Secretary of State withdrew the March  2007  decision  or  whether  the
    claimant withdrew his appeal for reasons that were not related  to  the
    Secretary of State's withdrawal. However, for the sake of completeness,
    I should say that the evidence is that it was the  Secretary  of  State
    who withdrew the decision and  that  the  claimant  then  withdrew  his
    appeal because the Secretary of State had withdrawn  his  decision.  My
    reasons are as follows:

    (i)    The evidence concerning the Secretary  of  State's  reasons  for
         withdrawing the decision is not clear. There is some inconsistency.
         The evidence produced as a result of the FOI request  suggests,  on
         the one hand, that it may have  been  due  to  the  fact  that  the
         Secretary of State mistakenly considered that the  claimant  was  a
         minor.

    (ii)   However, there is also evidence which suggests that, in view  of
         the fact that the claimant had not re-offended  since  the  offence
         for which he received  a  DTO,  it  was  not  considered  that  the
         Secretary of State would be successful in the appeal.

    (iii)   Importantly,  the  AIT70  Notice  specifically  refers  to  the
         Secretary of State having withdrawn the original decision and Judge
         Mayall's Record of the proceedings states  that  the  decision  was
         withdrawn.

(iv) The applicable framework - the parties' submissions

54. The next issue raised in the application for permission  to  amend  the
    grounds   is   whether   the   applicable   framework   for   assessing
    proportionality is that which relates to deportation and revocation  of
    deportation (that is, s.117C of the 2002 Act and paras 362-399A of  the
    Immigration Rules) or that which relates to non-deportation cases (that
    is, s.117A-B of the 2002 Act and paras 276ADE, Appendix FM and EX.1  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules).

55. Section 117A(2) and s.117C(7) of the 2002 Act provide as follows:

         S.117A:

         (2)      In considering the public interest question, the court or
         tribunal must (in particular) have regard-

             (a) in all cases, to the considerations listed in section
             117B, and

             (b) in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals,
             to the considerations listed in section 117C.

         S.117C:

         (7)      The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be
         taken into account where a court or tribunal is considering a
         decision to deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that the
         reason for the decision was the offence or offences for which the
         criminal has been convicted.

         (My emphasis)

56. The claimant's case may be summarised as follows:

    (i)    Ms Bayati accepted that the claimant satisfied the definition of
         "foreign criminal " in s.117D(2).

    (ii)   However, given that the deportation order was a nullity, this is
         not a case "concerning the  deportation"  of  a  foreign  criminal.
         Since s.117A(2)(b) only requires s.117C to be considered "in  cases
         concerning the deportation of foreign criminals", s.117C  does  not
         apply.

    (iii)  Furthermore, there is no "decision to deport" within the meaning
         of s.117C(7).

57. Mr Clarke submitted that,  given  that  the  appeal  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal was an appeal against a decision  to  refuse  a  human  rights
    claim, the question whether the case concerns deportation falls  to  be
    considered only when the Upper Tribunal is considering proportionality.
    He submitted that s.117C does apply because the claimant's human rights
    claim does "concern deportation",  pursuant  to  s.117A(2)(b).  In  his
    submission, there was a "decision to deport" within s.117C(7).

(v) The applicable framework - assessment

58. It can be seen from para 55(ii) above that the claimant's case is drawn
    from Ms Bayati's submission that the deportation order is a nullity.

59. The Upper Tribunal no longer has the power to declare that  a  decision
    is a nullity or that it is invalid. In my judgment, it would  undermine
    Parliament's decision to remove that power and the  related  ground  of
    appeal (by the amendments made to ss.82-86  of  the  2002  Act  by  the
    Immigration Act 2014) if it were open to a claimant to  argue,  in  the
    context of a human rights appeal, that a decision to deport  him  or  a
    refusal to revoke a deportation order was a nullity  or  unlawful.  Any
    such  challenge  must  be  brought  elsewhere.  Until  and  unless  the
    deportation order and/or the  refusal  to  revoke  it  are  declared  a
    nullity  or  quashed,  the  instant  case  is  a  case  that  "concerns
    deportation" for the purposes of s.117A(2)(b). There is a  decision  to
    deport for the purposes of s.117C(7). There is simply no  mechanism  by
    which the Tribunal can step around the fact that there is  in  place  a
    deportation order and a refusal to revoke it.

60. I have therefore concluded that the correct  legal  framework  is  that
    which applies by virtue of s.117A(2)(b), that  is,  s.117C  applies  as
    well as paras 362-399A of the Immigration Rules apply.

61. Having dealt with all of the  issues  raised  in  the  application  for
    permission to amend the grounds, I now step back to consider whether to
    grant the application for permission to amend the grounds of appeal. In
    doing so, I take into account that I have rejected all of  Ms  Bayati's
    submissions for reasons which I have given  above.  I  also  take  into
    account the following:

    (i)    As I have said, the proper avenue for bringing any challenge  to
         the legality of the deportation order and the refusal to revoke the
         deportation order was by bringing a judicial review claim. However,
         any such judicial review claim would now be seriously out of  time.
         Over 9 years have elapsed since the deportation order was made  and
         over 1 1/2 years  since  the  decision  to  refuse  to  revoke  the
         deportation order.

    (ii)   At one stage, Ms Bayati referred me to paras 6-7 of the skeleton
         argument that was before Judge Thomas. In my  judgment,  paras  6-7
         did not make any legality argument, much less an argument that  the
         FtT did not have jurisdiction. Paras 6-7 of the  skeleton  argument
         before Judge Thomas raised various facts  under  a  heading  called
         "material facts" without advancing any legal points on the basis of
         the facts. The claimant's response dated 14 January 2019, which was
         settled by Mr Metzer, under  rule  24  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
         (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  did  not  raise  any  jurisdiction  or
         legality arguments, nor did Mr Metzer raise any such  arguments  at
         the EOL hearing on 22 January 2019.

    (iii)  There has therefore been a very serious delay indeed in bringing
         the jurisdiction and legality arguments.

    (iv)   Ms Bayati submitted that any issue as to timeliness  should  not
         be held against the claimant. She submitted that the  claimant  did
         not know the outcome of the appeal before  Judge  Mayall  until  16
         April 2019 and that, in any event, he was in detention in 2010  and
         then subsequently removed.

    (v)    However, the fact is that the claimant was represented by Dexter
         Montague & Partners at the time of his appeal before Judge  Mayall.
         Furthermore, the AIT70 Notice was sent to him at the  address  that
         was held on the records and to Dexter Montague & Partners. I do not
         accept the submission at para 2 of the April 2019 skeleton argument
         that there was no determination or  notice  from  the  AIT  of  the
         appeal in 2007. The AIT70 Notice  was  plainly  sent  to  both  the
         claimant and his representatives. It is  most  unlikely  that  both
         went missing. If the claimant did not know that the  appeal  before
         Judge Mayall had been concluded, it begs the question  why  he  has
         not enquired about the appeal in the years since May 2007. Not only
         was  he  was  represented  then,  he  has  had  access   to   legal
         representation since notwithstanding that he was in  detention  and
         subsequently removed. He re-entered the United Kingdom illegally in
         July 2010. No explanation has been given why he waited until  April
         2019 before taking steps to obtain documentation from the FtT in an
         effort to confirm what had happened to his appeal in 2007.

62. In all of the circumstances, and for all of the reasons given above,  I
    refuse  to  exercise  my  discretion  to  grant  the  application   for
    permission to amend the grounds of  appeal  so  as  to  add  additional
    grounds.



E. RE-MAKING OF THE DECISION ON THE CLAIMANT'S APPEAL

63. On 9 April 2019, I heard oral evidence from the claimant, SC  and  SC's
    father, Mr NC.  Their oral evidence is set  out  at  Annex  B  to  this
    decision. Although I summarise their  evidence  in  this  part  of  the
    decision, I stress that I have taken into account all of their oral and
    written evidence as well as all of the other documents that  have  been
    served. I have taken into account  the  other  witness  statements  and
    letters, including the witness statement of NC's wife,  the  claimant's
    brother, the witness statements and  letters  at  14-18  and  87-89  of
    bundle A, medical evidence relating to SC, the psychology report  dated
    27 July 2018 of Mr Roy Shuttleworth (pages 19-24 of bundle A)  and  the
    many photographs handed to me at the hearing on 9 April 2019.

64. I have taken into account the summary  of  Judge  Thomas  of  the  oral
    evidence that was before her, at paras 5-9 of her  decision.  I  remind
    myself that the EOL decision preserved the following findings of fact:

    a)     at para 23, that the  claimant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with SC and SS; and

    b)     at para 24, the findings made by the judge as follows:

             "...  Despite  her  age,  [SS]  will  be  familiar  with  [the
             claimant] as her father. She has a real relationship with  her
             maternal grandparents who are settled in the UK. As a  British
             citizen she is entitled to the benefits  and  entitlements  of
             her nationality.  Her  best  interests  are  served  with  her
             remaining in the care of both parents in the UK".

65. At the hearing on 30 July 2019, Mr Clarke informed  me  that  the  Home
    Office file had not reached  him  and  therefore  he  had  not  had  an
    opportunity to refresh his memory on the oral evidence that  was  heard
    on 9 April 2019. I provided Mr Clarke with a copy of my typed notes  of
    the claimant's oral  evidence.  Ms  Bayati  agreed  that  it  would  be
    appropriate for me to read to Mr Clarke from my hand-written  notes  of
    the oral evidence of SC and NC so that  he  could  participate  in  the
    hearing of the Article 8 appeal.

66. I have decided that s.117C of the 2002 Act as well as paras 362-399A of
    the Immigration Rules apply. The issue is whether  the  claimant  comes
    within one of the exceptions  to  deportation  and,  if  he  does  not,
    whether there are very compelling circumstances over  and  above  those
    described in paras 399 and 399A so that  the  public  interest  in  his
    deportation is outweighed. The standard of  proof  is  the  balance  of
    probabilities.  I  have  taken  into  account  the  relevant  case-law,
    including but not limited to Razgar, ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4
    as to the best interests of a child being a primary  consideration  and
    Beoku-Betts [2008] UKHL 39 as to the need  to  take  into  account  the
    human rights of those with whom a claimant enjoys family life.

67. At the hearing on 9 April 2019, Ms Bayati informed me that she did  not
    rely upon the private life exception and that her  real  focus  was  on
    whether it would be unduly harsh for SS if  the  claimant  were  to  be
    removed. At the hearing on 30 July 2019, she  asked  me  to  take  into
    account the claimant's private life exception, the family  life-partner
    exception, the family life-child exception together with  the  historic
    nature of the claimant's offence and the  fact  that  he  has  not  re-
    offended in the event that it is necessary for  me  to  decide  whether
    there are very compelling circumstances over and above those  described
    in paras 399 and 399A.

68. Notwithstanding that Ms Bayati only relied upon the claimant's  private
    life claim if it became necessary for me to decide  whether  there  are
    very compelling circumstances over and above those described  in  paras
    399 and 399A, I shall follow a  structured  approach,  by  considering,
    first, whether any of the exceptions apply and, if not,  whether  there
    are very compelling circumstances over and  above  those  described  in
    paras 399 and 399A.  This approach reveals  the  extent  to  which  the
    relevant criteria in each exception is satisfied or is  not  satisfied.
    This is relevant in considering the public interest in deportation when
    assessing whether there are  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
    above those described in  paras  399  and  399A  if  that  question  is
    reached.

(i) Oral evidence heard on 9 April 2019

The claimant's oral evidence

69. The claimant recalled making his statement dated 9 August 2018 (pages 1-
    5 of bundle A) and his statement dated  8  April  2019  (pages  1-2  of
    bundle B). He wished to delete the incomplete sentence at  the  top  of
    his second page  of  his  statement  dated  8  April  2019.  With  this
    correction, the contents of his statements were true and correct to the
    best of his recollection.

70. Six of the large number of photographs that  had  been  submitted  were
    shown to the claimant.  He  identified  his  daughter,  his  daughter's
    friend and three cousins.

71. In cross-examination, the claimant said  that,  if  he  is  allowed  to
    remain in the United  Kingdom,  he  would  undertake  employment  as  a
    builder. He has experience in brick-laying. His wife would then stay at
    home and look after their daughter. He would be able to earn as much as
    his wife currently earns, i.e. �2,000 a month, as a bricklayer.

72. The claimant would not be able to  work  as  a  bricklayer  in  Albania
    because such jobs are not available. The maximum pay is  �3.00-�3.50  a
    day. The claimant was referred to the evidence at pages 71-77 of bundle
    A which provided some  evidence  about  the  rate  of  unemployment  in
    Albania and pages 71-77 of bundle A which provided  a  table  comparing
    the gross domestic product ("GDP") of Albania and the  United  Kingdom.
    Asked why there was no evidence to support his claim that he could only
    earn �3 a day as a bricklayer in Albania, he said that payslips are not
    provided by employers in Albania. It is not possible to obtain evidence
    of how much builders and bricklayers earn in Albania.

73. Asked whether job  advertisements  in  Albania  indicate  what  pay  is
    offered, the claimant said that potential workers are  told  what  they
    would be paid when they turn up to ask for the jobs.

74. The claimant has not made  any  enquiries  about  the  availability  of
    employment for him in Albania. However, he knows how much he would earn
    because his uncle in Albania works in the building trade. His uncle  is
    a bricklayer in Albania. Asked whether his uncle  could  have  provided
    him with evidence to confirm how much he would earn as a bricklayer  in
    Albania, the claimant said that  the  evidence  he  had  given  to  the
    Tribunal was what his uncle had told him.

75. Asked whether his uncle could introduce  him  to  employers  who  could
    offer him work in Albania, the claimant said he did not think so. It is
    hard to get jobs in Albania.

76. The claimant's uncle is old, being 60 years old. He has a  wife  and  a
    son who is 33 or 34 years old and who lives with him. He also has three
    daughters who are married. They all live in his uncle's house. He could
    not live with his uncle because there is not enough  space.  His  uncle
    has always worked as a bricklayer. Asked whether this  means  that  his
    uncle was able to raise four children on his earnings as a  bricklayer,
    the claimant said that his uncle used to farm and work as a  bricklayer
    in a village before he moved to the city where his children grew up and
    where he worked as a bricklayer.

77. SC's parents live about 10 minutes away from his home. The claimant has
    a brother who lives in Reading in the United Kingdom. His  brother  has
    children. He confirmed his evidence in first  witness  statement,  that
    his brother and his family have been his bedrock during the hard  times
    that he and his wife have experienced. He  sees  his  brother's  family
    once a week. He takes his daughter with him to visit them.

78. Asked whether there was any reason to think that his  brother  and  his
    brother's family would not continue to provide support to his wife  and
    daughter if he were to return to Albania, the  claimant  said  that  it
    would be different if he was not around, although they  would  continue
    to provide support. Asked how it would be different, he  said  that  he
    would not be in the United Kingdom to see his brother once or  twice  a
    week and it would be difficult for his brother to visit SC and  SS.  He
    confirmed that his brother and his family would support SC and help her
    if he was not in the United Kingdom. Once he leaves the United Kingdom,
    the family will feel different because he will not be present.

79. SC's parents help the claimant and SC financially, if they  are  stuck.
    However, they have their  own  lives.  At  the  moment,  they  are  not
    providing any financial help. They only do so if the  claimant  and  SC
    are really in need of something. Para 8 of the decision of Judge Thomas
    stated that SC's parents  help  the  claimant  and  SC  financially  if
    needed. Asked whether  they  would  continue  to  do  if  the  claimant
    returned to Albania, he said that they would not, not even until he was
    able to support himself in Albania. If he leaves the United Kingdom, SC
    would have to stop work. She would therefore require a lot of financial
    assistance.

80. The claimant confirmed that his mother and sister are  in  Albania.  In
    addition, he had his uncle who he had mentioned earlier.

81. Asked why he would not be able to stay with his mother  temporarily  if
    he returned to Albania given that he had  stayed  with  his  mother  on
    returning to Albania previously, he said that his mother  has  her  own
    life and he is not a child anymore. He has  not  discussed  the  matter
    with his mother.

82. The claimant said that his daughter does not hold Albanian  nationality
    in addition to British citizenship. This is because he has  not  had  a
    chance to go to Albania and he does not know  if  dual  nationality  is
    permitted.

83. SC has suffered from anxiety for about 8 to 10 years.

SC's oral evidence

84. SC confirmed the contents of her first witness statement dated 9 August
    2018 (pages 6-9 of bundle A) and her second witness statement  dated  8
    April 2019 (pages 3-5 of bundle B).

85. SC said that she is claustrophobic and has not travelled  by  plane  in
    the last six years. She has suffered from  claustrophobia  on  and  off
    since she was 18 years old. Even as she travelled to the hearing centre
    on 9 April 2019, her anxiety level was getting very high. She is taking
    Propranolol for anxiety and panic attacks, which is the reason why  she
    is unable to fly.

86. SC said that, if the claimant  is  removed,  she  would  have  to  stop
    working in order to care for her daughter. She would therefore have  to
    rely upon the benefit system to support herself. At present, her father
    helps her and the claimant by giving them extra money when they need it
    but he would not be able to pay for all of her outgoings if she had  to
    give up work. Even if she works full-time, she would not be able to pay
    for childcare.

87. SS is three years old and will begin to  attend  nursery  in  September
    2019 for 3 hours a day five days a week. It would be her choice  as  to
    whether SS attends the morning session or the afternoon  session.  SC's
    mother works part-time for 16 hours a week. She works from 9 am to 3.30
    pm and returns home at about 4pm. Her father works full-time in a bank.
    Her parents are elderly and  they  both  work.  They  work  Mondays  to
    Fridays and have two days off a week.

88. SC has two brothers and an older  sister.  Her  older  sister  and  her
    younger brother both live in Coventry. Her older  brother,  who  is  30
    years old and who suffers  from  schizophrenia  and  other  conditions,
    lives with her parents. He does not work.

89. SC said that it is not possible for her to rely  upon  her  parents  to
    help her with looking after  SS  because  they  look  after  her  older
    brother and also because SS would have a  half  term  holiday  every  6
    weeks. Her older brother is unstable at the moment. He  has  good  days
    and bad days and sometimes her parents are called out of work  to  look
    after him.

90. The claimant's brother lives close by. The brother's wife, who does not
    work, is very busy with her own children, including  a  new-born  baby.
    She would therefore be unable  to  help  SC.  SC  sees  the  claimant's
    brother and his family maybe once every two weeks and when she has  her
    days off, maybe once a week or twice.

91. Asked why she would not be able to raise SS on her own in view  of  the
    fact that many working single parents raise children on their own,  she
    said that her worry was not so much about the fact that she  would  not
    be working but the fact that her family would be split.

92. Asked to explain why her circumstances  were  such  that  it  would  be
    unduly harsh to expect her and SC to live in the United Kingdom without
    the claimant, SC said that the claimant is SS's primary carer. He looks
    after SS so that SC can work. If SC is unable to work,  she  would  not
    have money to cover her living costs. She would have to rely  upon  the
    benefits system. She would have a split and broken family. SS would  be
    distraught. SS's bond with the claimant is stronger than her bond  with
    SC.

93. When SC met the claimant, she was aware of his immigration status. They
    decided that they wanted to be  together.  This  outweighed  everything
    else. If he is removed, she would not go with him to  live  in  Albania
    because she would not be able to do so.

NC's oral evidence

94. NC confirmed the contents of his statement dated 8 August  2018  (pages
    10-11 of bundle A). Financially, he supports SC with small  amounts  of
    money, "hundreds of  pounds",  when  she  and  the  claimant  run  into
    difficulties.

95. NC's older son has just been diagnosed with schizophrenia  and  autism.
    He is now 31 years old and has been living at home with NC and his wife
    for a year.  They  are  providing  him  with  care  and  mental  health
    treatment privately which is costing thousands. It  took  the  NHS  two
    years to diagnose his son with schizophrenia. He was aggressive and, at
    one point, the NHS suggested that the son live in a tent in  the  woods
    whilst they found him a hospice. His wife then cashed  in  her  pension
    and they paid a total of �9,000 for him to stay at a Travelodge.  After
    having his new medication, he has returned  to  his  former  quiet  and
    sensitive self. He returned to live with NC and his wife.

96. NC and his wife were then asked to pay �750 for  an  autism  test.  Now
    that he has been diagnosed with autism, the NHS mental health team have
    said that they cannot treat his autism. NC and his wife will  therefore
    have to pay for his autism treatment privately. Hopefully the NHS  will
    pay for his schizophrenia therapy. His son  needs  Dialectic  Behaviour
    Therapy ("DBT") which has not been offered by the  NHS,  although  they
    have waited for 2 years.  It is not clear what will  happen  concerning
    the schizophrenia treatment. It is  not  known  whether  the  NHS  will
    provide it because the  NHS  team  has  said  that  his  son  will  not
    understand the schizophrenia treatment given that he has been diagnosed
    with autism.

97. Asked how much the autism  treatment  would  cost,  NC  said  that  the
    therapy costs �90 per hour and his son would need two sessions  of  one
    hour each a month. The monthly costs would therefore be �180.

98. In examination-in-chief, NC said that his  son  is  currently  studying
    English literature in Reading University. In  re-examination,  he  said
    that his son commenced a different course  in  2016  which  he  had  to
    suspend in 2017 after commencing his second year, at the suggestion  of
    the University, due to his health problems. He is not  well  enough  to
    return to that course. He has therefore  commenced  a  part-time  music
    course a Newbury College for 3 days a week which he finds is very  good
    for his condition.

99. NC said that he works as a temporary I.T. consultant. He  is  62  years
    old and hopes to retire soon. Occasionally, he has to provide emergency
    funding to his younger son who is studying for a PhD at university.

100. Mr Clarke put to NC that, if the claimant were to be  removed,  he  and
    his wife could help SC either financially or with  childcare,  NC  said
    that he could help but he could be out of work very soon.  He  has  not
    worked in telecommunications  for  15  years.  He  has  specialised  in
    banking which is shedding staff. He could help SC with small amounts of
    money. He and his wife have a lot of expenses and they do not have much
    spare money. He only has a small pension and he is therefore putting as
    much money as he can into his pension.

101. Questioned further about his work, NC said that he is a director  in  a
    company which he owns. The company takes temporary assignments or fixed
    term contracts, for work on a full-time basis. His wife works  for  the
    same company, 30 hours a week. She works Mondays to Thursday, 6 hours a
    day, and has Fridays and the weekends off. She works from 7.30 a.m.  to
    about 1.30 p.m. or 2 p.m., Mondays to Thursdays. Mr Clarke  put  to  NC
    that SC had suggested that her mother worked five days a week. NC  said
    that his wife used to work five days a week but she  decided  that  she
    wanted to take more time off work.

102. NC said that his company was set up 5 years ago.  Asked  whether  there
    has ever been any problem in his company obtaining work  since  it  was
    set up, NC said that he has been lucky in being  able  to  obtain  work
    over the last 30 years. Asked whether there have been any gaps  in  the
    contracts, he said  that  he  has  been  able  to  secure  back-to-back
    contracts. He is the company's only employee.

103. Asked to explain why SC had said that he worked in a  bank  whereas  he
    had said that he was a company director, NC said that his time is split
    between his I.T. consultancy work and his  work  in  telecommunications
    and settlement  systems,  enhancing  existing  systems,  in  investment
    banking.

104. Concerning his household income, NC said, initially, that  he  and  his
    wife earn �10,000 each and they each receive �25,000  each  by  way  of
    dividends. He then said that he takes  �8,500  in  the  form  of  gross
    salary and �25,000 as dividends from his company,  making  a  total  of
    �33,000. His wife takes a similar amount, �33,000 in  total.  Asked  to
    explain his earlier evidence which was different, he  said  that  their
    joint total takings were �66,000-�67,000.  They  owe  �6,000  on  their
    mortgage.

105. Asked how often he and his wife see SC and SS, he said  that  his  wife
    babysits SS on Saturdays because SC works at a hairdresser's  salon  on
    Saturdays.

106. Asked whether he and his wife could give SC more emotional  support  if
    the claimant were to be removed, NC said that he works in  London.  His
    wife could visit SC and support her emotionally on  Fridays,  Saturdays
    and Sundays and possibly the evenings on the other days.  However,  she
    also looks  after  their  older  son  who  deteriorates  badly  in  the
    afternoons. They have to help him in the evenings.

107. Asked to explain why he had earlier said that his son had  reverted  to
    his former quiet sensitive self, whereas he was now saying that his son
    deteriorates badly in the afternoons, NC said that since his medication
    was changed, his son has become depressed and becomes paranoid when  he
    goes out. He then returns home in a bad state,  talking  about  killing
    himself. Asked why he had said earlier that his son had returned to his
    former quiet sensitive self, NC said that his son is quiet. Previously,
    he was aggressive, punching holes in the walls and insulting people  in
    the street. His behaviour now is not such as requires  anyone  to  look
    after him in the morning. He only needs help in the afternoons.

(ii) Assessment of the evidence

108. For reasons which I will give later, I find that, even if the  evidence
    before me is taken at its highest, the outcome of this appeal would  be
    the same. However, as I have heard oral evidence and in order to  adopt
    a "belt and braces"  approach,  I  will  assess  credibility  and  make
    findings of fact.

109. I did not find the three witnesses who gave  oral  evidence  before  me
    credible. My reasons are as follows:

110. The claimant said in his oral evidence that he would  not  be  able  to
    obtain work as a bricklayer in Albania because, he said, such jobs  are
    not available.  I  found  his  unsupported  evidence  that  work  as  a
    bricklayer is not obtainable in Albania  incredible.  It  was  his  own
    evidence that his uncle works as  a  bricklayer  and,  when  questioned
    further, he admitted that he had  not  made  any  enquiries  about  the
    availability of work in Albania.

111. The claimant's evidence that he could only earn �3 a day in Albania  as
    a bricklayer is not supported  by  any  evidence.  In  his  attempt  to
    explain why there was no supporting evidence, he said that  it  is  not
    possible to obtain evidence of how much builders and  bricklayers  earn
    in Albania. I did not find this evidence credible given that his  uncle
    works as a bricklayer. He could have asked his  uncle  to  provide  him
    with some independent supporting evidence. Instead, he  said  that  his
    uncle had told him that he could only earn �3 a day and  that  was  the
    evidence he was giving to the Tribunal.

112. I do not accept the claimant's explanation that he would  not  be  able
    to stay with his mother temporarily if  he  returned  to  Albania.  His
    explanation was that his mother has her own life and he  is  not  child
    anymore. However, he stayed with her when he  returned  to  Albania  in
    2010 when he was 25 years old and was therefore no longer a child then.



113. I do not accept the claimant's evidence that NC and his wife would  not
    be prepared to help him financially temporarily until  he  is  able  to
    support himself in Albania. It is clear to me, on all of the  oral  and
    written  evidence,  including  Mr  Shuttleworth's  description  of  the
    relationship between SS and the claimant, on the  one  hand,  and  SS's
    parents, that they are all very close and NC  and  his  wife  are  very
    supportive of SS and the claimant. I do not believe  that  NC  and  his
    wife would simply let the claimant fend for himself if he needed short-
    term financial assistance. Likewise, it is clear that the  claimant  is
    close to his brother and his brother's family. I do not  believe  that,
    if SC needed assistance with childcare, the claimant's brother and  his
    wife would refuse to help.

114. SC sought to suggest that she would be unable to look  to  her  parents
    for help with childcare, saying that her parents are elderly, that they
    work Mondays to Fridays and only have two days off whereas it was clear
    from NC's evidence that his wife has three days  off  a  week.  It  was
    clear to me that this is a close-knit family as indeed Mr  Shuttleworth
    indicates at para 18 of his report. I do not find it credible  that  SC
    would not have known that her mother now works four days a week and has
    three days off. I find that she sought to mislead me.

115. SC's evidence that she has suffered from claustrophobia for 6 years  is
    not supported by any medical evidence. The medical evidence at pages 6-
    7 of Bundle B comprises of her GP's records from 31  July  2017  to  26
    November 2018. It is clear  that  she  is  taking  Propranolol  10  mgs
    tablets once a day for generalised anxiety. She has had  panic  attacks
    and migraines. There is no mention of  any  problem  of  claustrophobia
    reported to the GP between 31 July 2017 to 26 November 2018.  The  list
    of "problems" at the bottom of page 7 which records "problems" reported
    to her doctor between 23 June 2010 and 8 July 2016 makes no mention  of
    claustrophobia.

116. When I asked Ms Bayati at the hearing on 9  April  2019  whether  there
    was any further medical evidence, Ms Bayati informed me that there  had
    not been sufficient time to obtain any. However, the EOL  decision  was
    sent to the parties on 25 January 2019. There was  ample  time  between
    then and the hearing on 9 April 2019 and certainly before  the  hearing
    on 31 July 2019 for medical evidence to be obtained and  submitted.  In
    view of my general assessment of SC's credibility, I find that  it  has
    not been shown that SC suffers from claustrophobia or that  this  would
    prevent her from travelling to Albania to visit the claimant.

117. The GP's records at pages 6-7 were printed on 5 April 2019. This  shows
    that SC was taking Propranolol as at April 2019.

118. There was a tendency on the part of all  three  witnesses  to  downplay
    the possibility of financial support for SC and the claimant from  SC's
    parents in the future. I do not accept  the  claimant's  evidence  that
    SC's parents would not or could not help financially at all, given that
    SC and her parents are a close family, that SC's parents have helped SC
    and the claimant financially in the  past  and,  on  my  findings,  are
    financially able to do so in the future for the reasons given below.

119. NC initially sought to portray that his work was insecure  saying  that
    he was a temporary I.T. consultant. However, when  questioned  further,
    he said that he was a company director, that he owned the company, that
    the company had always had back-to-back contracts in the past and  that
    he had been very lucky in being able to obtain work over  the  last  30
    years.  It  was  plain  from  his  subsequent  evidence  (upon  further
    questioning) that his work was not insecure at all.

120.  NC  initially  said  that  the  treatment  for  his  son  "is  costing
    thousands", giving the impression that this was  the  ongoing  cost  of
    treatment for his son. He said that he and his wife had  paid  for  the
    son's accommodation at Travelodge which cost �9,000. Plainly  this  was
    not the cost of treatment but the cost of accommodation.  Upon  further
    questioning, it became clear not only that this cost had  already  been
    incurred, the circumstances that gave rise to the cost of accommodation
    being incurred are not likely to arise again as the son  has  now  been
    diagnosed and is receiving treatment.

121. Furthermore, the actual cost to NC and his wife of his son's  treatment
    in the past was �750 for an autism test. As to the cost  of  his  son's
    treatment in the future, it became clear on further questioning that NC
    currently anticipates having to pay for two sessions of therapy a month
    for his son's treatment for autism. This would cost a total of  �180  a
    month. NC said he did not know if the  NHS  would  pay  for  his  son's
    schizophrenia treatment. There is simply  no  evidence  how  much  this
    would cost if NC and his wife have to provide it to his son.

122. On the whole of the evidence, I find that the  evidence  NC  gave  upon
    further questioning simply did not tally with his initial evidence that
    his son's treatment "is costing thousands".

123. I do not accept NC's evidence that he and his wife have little cash  to
    spare, given that it is plain that they only  have  a  small  mortgage,
    their joint income is �70,000 according to  his  initial  evidence  and
    �66,000 according to his subsequent evidence and that, on the facts  as
    known at present, his son's treatment would cost �180 a month.

124. For the reasons given above, I find that SC would be able  to  look  to
    her parents for some financial support to pay for childcare. NC and his
    wife are able and willing to provide financial assistance  to  SC  and,
    temporarily, to the claimant until he is able  to  support  himself  in
    Albania.

125. NC initially said that, after his son received medication, he  returned
    to his former quiet sensitive self. However, when questioned whether he
    and his wife could give SC more emotional support if  the  claimant  is
    removed, he said that his son deteriorates  badly  in  the  afternoons.
    There was no mention of this in the earlier part of his evidence.  When
    asked to explain his earlier evidence that his son had returned to  his
    former quiet sensitive self, he said that his son is  quiet  and  needs
    help in the afternoons. This does not explain his  failure  to  mention
    earlier that his son still needs help in the  afternoons.  His  initial
    evidence that his son has returned to his former  quiet  and  sensitive
    self was not  consistent  with  SC's  evidence  that  her  brother  was
    unstable at the moment.

126. Mr Shuttleworth's report was prepared following his  meeting  with  the
    claimant and SC on 24 July 2018. On the basis of his interview with the
    claimant and SC, Mr Shuttleworth said, inter alia,  that  the  claimant
    was the "leader and primary carer" of SS  (para  15);  that  given  his
    experience and observations it was clear to him that the  claimant  was
    the "parent in control" and to whom SS listened  the  most  (para  14);
    that  it  was  clear  to  him  that  SS  "would  be  quite   devastated
    emotionally" if the claimant were to leave the United Kingdom; and that
    he "would suggest that this could well  have  a  major  effect  on  her
    emotional development which is  clearly  at  a  crucial  stage  at  her
    present age" (para 11). It appears that  SS  was  not  present  at  the
    meeting from which it must follow that Mr Shuttleworth was relying upon
    what was relayed to him by the claimant and SC. Nevertheless, I  accept
    his evidence. I place some weight, as I  consider  appropriate,  on  Mr
    Shuttleworth's report.

127. On the whole of the evidence, I make the following findings  which  are
    in addition to the preserved findings of Judge Thomas:

    (i)    The claimant, SC and SS are a close family unit, albeit that  SS
         is closer to the claimant than to SC. They as  a  family  unit  are
         also close to NC and his wife who, according to  Mr  Shuttleworth's
         report (para 18) are regular visitors.

    (ii)   If the claimant is removed, SC and also  SS  would  have  strong
         emotional support from NC  and  his  wife.  They  would  also  have
         emotional support from the claimant's brother and his family.

    (iii)  SC would be able to obtain some financial support and some  help
         with childcare from her parents. She would also be able  to  obtain
         some help with childcare from the family of the claimant's brother,
         who are also close to SC and the claimant.

    (iv)   It has not been shown that SC would be unable to pay for any gap
         in childcare and also support herself if she continued to work full-
         time and/or reduced her hours of work.

    (v)    SC is suffering from generalised anxiety. She has also had panic
         attacks and migraines.  I do  not  accept  that  she  suffers  from
         claustrophobia.

(iii) Exception 1 - private life exception (s.117C(4)) and para 399A

128. It  is  plain  that  the  claimant  cannot  satisfy  the  private  life
    exception because he has not  been  lawfully  resident  in  the  United
    Kingdom for most of his life.

129. In addition, it is necessary for  the  claimant  to  show  that  he  is
    socially and culturally integrated. This is a concept which  is  to  be
    interpreted with common sense: SC (Jamaica) [2017] EWCA Civ 2112.

130. I find that the evidence before me is insufficient  to  show  that  the
    claimant is  culturally integrated into society in the United  Kingdom.
    He speaks English. He is married to a British citizen. He is  close  to
    his wife's family. There is also a letter of support from SC's aunt (at
    page 18 of bundle A) and a letter of support from her brother (page  17
    of bundle A). However, whilst this is relevant evidence, there is  very
    limited evidence indeed of integration into the wider society. There is
    a witness statement from someone who describes himself as a very  close
    friend (page 14-15 of bundle A) and who says that the claimant and  his
    family have a strong network of friends in Reading and are an  integral
    and valued part of the community in which they reside. However, no  one
    else from this "strong network of friends" has written to  support  the
    claimant's appeal. He himself did not attend to give oral evidence.

131. The very limited evidence of integration into  society  in  the  United
    Kingdom is surprising given the length of the claimant's residence.

132. On the evidence before me, I find that the  claimant  is  not  socially
    and culturally integrated into the United Kingdom.

133. In considering the claimant's circumstances on  return  to  Albania,  I
    remind myself of para 14 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in SSHD
    v Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ  813, which reads:

         "14.      In  my  view,  the  concept  of  a   foreign   criminal's
             "integration" into the country to which it is proposed that he
             be deported, as set out in section  117C(4)(c)  and  paragraph
             399A, is a broad one. It is not confined to the  mere  ability
             to find a job or to sustain life while  living  in  the  other
             country. It is not appropriate to treat the statutory language
             as subject to some gloss and it will usually be sufficient for
             a court or tribunal simply to direct itself in the terms  that
             Parliament has chosen to use. The idea of "integration"  calls
             for a broad evaluative judgment to be made as to  whether  the
             individual  will  be  enough  of  an  insider  in   terms   of
             understanding how life in the society in that other country is
             carried on and a capacity to participate in it, so as to  have
             a reasonable opportunity to be accepted there, to be  able  to
             operate on a day-to-day basis in that society and to build  up
             within a reasonable time a variety of human  relationships  to
             give substance to the individual's

134. The claimant has lived in the United Kingdom since his  arrival  on  15
    July 2005, save for two periods: (i) following his  appeal  hearing  in
    May 2007, and in December 2009, the  Dutch  authorities  contacted  the
    Home Office and stated that he was serving  a  prison  sentence  there,
    following which he was returned to the  United  Kingdom  on  8  January
    2010; and (ii) from 10 February 2010 when he was  deported  to  Albania
    and July 2010 when he re-entered the United Kingdom illegally. Although
    it is not clear precisely when in 2007/2008/2008  he  left  the  United
    Kingdom, he has nevertheless lived in the United  Kingdom  for  a  very
    long period, on any view. However, he has not claimed that  his  length
    of residence in the United Kingdom is such that, on that account alone,
    he would experience very significant obstacles to his reintegration  in
    Albania.

135. The claimant was born in Albania  and  grew  up  in  Albania.  He  left
    Albania at the age of 21 years. His mother and sister are  in  Albania.
    He also has an uncle who is in the same trade, i.e. bricklaying.  I  do
    not accept the claimant's evidence that he would not be able to  obtain
    employment as a bricklayer or find some other  suitable  employment  in
    Albania to support himself. I find that he would be able to  find  work
    and support himself. He has said not said  that  he  no  longer  speaks
    Albanian. I have found that he would be able to look to NC and his wife
    for short-term financial assistance until he is able to support himself
    in Albania.

136. On the whole of the evidence, I find  that  there  would  not  be  very
    significant obstacles to the claimant's reintegration in Albania.

137. Accordingly, the claimant does not satisfy the private  life  exception
    for three entirely separate reasons, each of which is determinative  of
    the exception.

(iv) Exception 2 - the family life-partner  exception  (s.117C(5)  and  para
399(b)

138. The claimant met SC in July 2011. They began living  together  in  July
    2013. As stated at para 13 above, he was granted DLR until 9  September
    2006 in a false name  and  assumed  date  of  birth.  Accordingly,  his
    relationship with SC was formed at a time when he  was  in  the  United
    Kingdom unlawfully.

139. Under para 399(b)(i) of the Immigration Rules, it must  be  shown  that
    the claimant and SC formed  their  relationship  at  a  time  when  the
    claimant was in the United Kingdom lawfully and his immigration  status
    was not precarious. This requirement is not mirrored in  s.117C(5).  Mr
    Clarke submitted that the claimant could not satisfy the  family  life-
    partner exception because he could not satisfy para  399(b)(i)  of  the
    Immigration Rules. Ms Bayati relied upon the fact that the  requirement
    in para 399(b)(i) is not mirrored in s.117C(5).

140. Ms Bayati did not refer me to any authority to support her  proposition
    whereas Mr Clarke relied upon Chege ("is a persistent offender") [2016]
    UKUT 00187 (IAC). In Chege, the  Upper  Tribunal  held  that  the  term
    "persistent offender" in s.117D(2)(c) of the 2002  Act  must  mean  the
    same  thing  as  "persistent  offender"  in  paragraph  398(c)  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

141. I agree with Mr Clarke that, by analogy with the  reasoning  in  Chege,
    s.117C(5) and para 399(b)  must  be  applied  consistently.  There  are
    numerous judgments of the higher courts in which  the  requirements  in
    para 399(b) have been applied without  it  being  considered  that  the
    family life-partner exception in  s.117C(5)  sets  different  and  less
    onerous criteria. To the contrary, the  Upper  Tribunal  considered  in
    Bossade (ss.117A-D: Interrelationship with Rules) [2015] UKUT 415 (IAC)
    that paras 398-399A set out the substantive requirements whereas s.117A-
    D set out the statements of principle.  This  makes  sense,  especially
    when one considers that the family-life exception in s.117C(5) does not
    set out the two-limbed requirement set  out  at  paras  399(b)(ii)  and
    (iii) but only refers to it being necessary to show that the effect  of
    deportation on the partner would be unduly harsh.

142. I therefore do not accept Ms  Bayati's  submission.  I  have  therefore
    concluded that the claimant cannot satisfy the criteria for the  family
    life-partner exception because his relationship with SC was established
    when he was in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

143. In any event, although Mr Clarke  accepted  that  it  would  be  unduly
    harsh for SC to live in Albania, I find that it  would  not  be  unduly
    harsh for SC to remain in the United Kingdom without the  claimant.  My
    reasons are as follows:

144. It is clear from KO (Nigeria) that the threshold for the  term  "unduly
    harsh" is an elevated one. At para 23 of its judgment in KO  (Nigeria),
    the Supreme Court said:

         "23.     ... the expression "unduly harsh" seems  clearly  intended
             to introduce a higher hurdle  than  that  of  "reasonableness"
             under section 117B(6), taking account of the  public  interest
             in the deportation of  foreign  criminals.  Further  the  word
             "unduly" implies an element of  comparison.  It  assumes  that
             there is a "due" level of "harshness", that is a  level  which
             may be acceptable or  justifiable  in  the  relevant  context.
             "Unduly" implies something going beyond that level.... One  is
             looking for a degree of  harshness  going  beyond  what  would
             necessarily  be  involved  for  any  child  faced   with   the
             deportation of a parent...."

145. At para 27, the Supreme Court approved of  the  guidance  given  in  MK
    (Sierra Leone) v SSHD [2015] UKUT 223 (IAC) as to the  meaning  of  the
    phrase "unduly harsh". Para 27 reads:

         "27.     Authoritative guidance as to the meaning of "unduly harsh"
             in this context was given by the Upper Tribunal  (McCloskey  J
             President and  UT  Judge  Perkins)  in  MK  (Sierra  Leone)  v
             Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2015]  UKUT  223
             (IAC), [2015] INLR 563, para 46, a decision given on 15  April
             2015. They referred to the "evaluative assessment" required of
             the tribunal:

                  "By way of self-direction, we  are  mindful  that  'unduly
                  harsh' does not equate with  uncomfortable,  inconvenient,
                  undesirable  or  merely  difficult.  Rather,  it  poses  a
                  considerably more  elevated  threshold.  'Harsh'  in  this
                  context, denotes something severe, or  bleak.  It  is  the
                  antithesis of pleasant or  comfortable.  Furthermore,  the
                  addition of the adverb 'unduly' raises an already elevated
                  standard still higher."

146. I find that SC's circumstances as they have been found to be  (I  refer
    to my findings of fact and the preserved findings of Judge Thomas)  are
    not such as to reach the threshold explained in  KO  (Nigeria)  and  MK
    (Sierra Leone), albeit that it might seem harsh, subjectively, to those
    affected by it. Indeed, even if SC has to give up  work  completely  in
    order to care for SS and relies upon the benefit system  for  financial
    support and even if she does suffer from claustrophobia so that she and
    SS would be unable to visit the claimant for several years, I find that
    the threshold of undue harshness is not reached.

(v) Exception 2 -  the  family  life-child  exception  (s.117C(5)  and  para
399(a)

147. Given the preserved  findings  of  Judge  Thomas  and  that  Mr  Clarke
    accepted that it would be unduly harsh for SS to live in  Albania,  the
    sole issue is whether it would be unduly harsh for SS to remain in  the
    United Kingdom without the claimant.

148. I again remind myself of all of the evidence in the case, including  Mr
    Shuttleworth's report, and the findings made, including  the  preserved
    finding of Judge Thomas that it is in the best interests of SS for  her
    to remain in the United Kingdom in the care of both parents. I  see  no
    reason not to accept his opinion that SS  "would  be  quite  devastated
    emotionally" if the claimant were to leave the United Kingdom; and that
    he "would suggest that this could well  have  a  major  effect  on  her
    emotional development which is  clearly  at  a  crucial  stage  at  her
    present age".

149. It is clear from KO (Nigeria) that I must not  take  into  account  the
    public interest but consider SS's circumstances and decide  whether  it
    would be unduly harsh for her the remain in the United Kingdom  without
    the claimant. There is nothing in KO (Nigeria) which precludes me  from
    taking  into  account  the  best  interests  of   SS   as   a   primary
    consideration.

150. Having considered  everything  in  the  round  and  having  taken  into
    account the best interests of SS as a  primary  consideration,  I  find
    that it would not be unduly harsh  for  SS  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom without the claimant, given the elevated threshold that applies
    as explained in KO (Nigeria) and MK (Sierra Leone), albeit that I again
    acknowledge that this decision might seem harsh, subjectively, to those
    affected by it.

151. Accordingly, the family life-child exception does not apply.

(vi) Very compelling circumstances over and above those described  in  paras
399 and 399A

152. The Court of Appeal held, in NA (Pakistan) and  others  v  SSHD  [2016]
    EWCA Civ 662, that foreign criminals who have not been sentenced  to  a
    period of imprisonment of at least 4 years may also seek  to  establish
    that there are very compelling  circumstances,  over  and  above  those
    described in Exceptions 1 and 2. The Court of Appeal also held  that  a
    deportee could rely,  by  way  of  very  compelling  circumstances,  on
    factual matters falling within the scope of the exceptions and  that  a
    person whose circumstances fell exclusively within the exceptions might
    still be able to  demonstrate  very  compelling  circumstances  if  the
    factual matters which fell within the exceptions went well beyond  what
    was necessary to make out a bare case under the exceptions.

153. In other words, a foreign  criminal  can  rely  on  matters  within  or
    outside the scope of the circumstances described in the exceptions, but
    would need to rely  on  features  which  made  their  Article  8  claim
    "especially strong" in the case of an offender sentenced  to  a  period
    imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12 months  (para  29  of
    the judgment) and "an especially compelling kind ... going well  beyond
    what would be necessary to make a bare case of the  kind  described  in
    Exceptions 1 and 2" in the case of an offender sentenced to a period of
    imprisonment of at least 4 years (para 30 of the judgment).

154. At paras 33 and 34 of NA (Pakistan), the Court of Appeal said:

         "33.     Although there  is  no  'exceptionality'  requirement,  it
             inexorably follows from the statutory scheme that the cases in
             which circumstances are sufficiently  compelling  to  outweigh
             the high public interest in deportation  will  be  rare.   The
             commonplace incidents of family life, such as  ageing  parents
             in poor  health  or  the  natural  love  between  parents  and
             children, will not be sufficient.

         34.      The best  interests  of  children  certainly  carry  great
             weight, as identified by Lord Kerr in HH v  Deputy  Prosecutor
             of the Italian Republic [2012] UKSC 25; [2013]  1  AC  338  at
             [145].  Nevertheless, it is a consequence of criminal  conduct
             that offenders may be separated from their children  for  many
             years, contrary to the best interests of those children.   The
             desirability  of  children  being  with  both  parents  is   a
             commonplace  of  family  life.   That   is   not   usually   a
             sufficiently compelling  circumstance  to  outweigh  the  high
             public interest in deporting foreign criminals.   As  Rafferty
             LJ observed in Secretary of State for the Home Department v CT
             (Vietnam) [2016] EWCA Civ 488 at [38]:

                  "Neither  the  British  nationality  of  the  respondent's
                  children nor their likely separation from their father for
                  a long time are exceptional circumstances  which  outweigh
                  the public interest in his deportation.""

         (My emphasis)

155. The public interest falls to be taken into account at this  stage.  The
    claimant was convicted of the offence in  October  2006  for  which  he
    received a sentence of 12 months' DTO. This goes in his favour  because
    the sentence is at the lowest level that can bring an individual within
    the S.117C.  However,  the  offence  in  question  was  an  offence  of
    possession of a  false  instrument.  There  is  a  public  interest  in
    deterring people from committing such offences.

156. The public interest is  increased  by  reason  of  the  fact  that  the
    claimant claimed asylum in a false name and with a false date of birth,
    obtaining DLR because the Secretary of  State  believed  him  to  be  a
    minor. Furthermore, after he was deported on 10 February 2010,  he  re-
    entered the United Kingdom illegally.

157. I take into account my assessment of the evidence in  relation  to  the
    private life exception,  the  family  life-partner  exception  and  the
    family life-child exception.

158. I accept that, during the claimant's lengthy residence,  he  will  have
    established private life. However, he has not submitted any evidence to
    show  that  there  are  any  strong  elements  of  his  private   life.
    Furthermore, any private life established in the period before his true
    name and date of birth were disclosed to the Secretary  of  State,  was
    established in the full knowledge that he had deceived the Secretary of
    State. He has subsequently established his private  life  in  the  full
    knowledge that his immigration  status  was  unlawful.  I  give  little
    weight to the claimant's private life established in the United Kingdom
    whilst he has been present unlawfully, pursuant  to  s.117B(4)  of  the
    2002 Act, although I bear in mind that the "little  weight"  provisions
    are not a fixity.

159. Given the very limited evidence, I find that there are no  features  of
    the claimant's private life that are especially strong, notwithstanding
    the length of his residence in the United Kingdom.

160. Ms Bayati asked me to take into account the  fact  that  the  lapse  of
    time since the claimant committed his offence and that he has  not  re-
    offended since.  The claimant says in his first witness statement  that
    he deeply regrets his actions, he is extremely remorseful  and  he  has
    not committed any offence since. NC says in his witness statement  that
    the claimant made errors of judgment. He speaks of the claimant's  good
    character. The close friend (page 14 of bundle A) says the claimant has
    changed a lot.

161. However, in Danso v SSHD [2015] EWCA  Civ  596,  the  Court  of  Appeal
    said, at para 20,  that  rehabilitation  and  the  lack  of  subsequent
    offending are not  uncommon  and  do  not  contribute  greatly  to  the
    existence  of  very  compelling  circumstances  required  to   outweigh
    deportation, although it may amount to an important  factor  in  a  few
    cases.  More recently, in Binbuga v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 551, the Court
    of Appeal said that rehabilitation involved no more  than  returning  a
    person to a place where society expects him to be and that it generally
    carries no material weight in the proportionality balance.

162. In my view, there is nothing in the  claimant's  case  which  justifies
    treating the fact that he has not committed any further offences as  an
    important factor or one which contributes in any material  way  in  his
    favour  in  my  assessment  of  whether  there  are   very   compelling
    circumstances, over and above the exceptions. This is not  one  of  the
    few cases in which rehabilitation and the lack of subsequent  offending
    amount to an important factor. He has not produced anything to  suggest
    that these considerations should be regarded as  important  factors  in
    his particular case.

163. In his witness statement,  the  claimant  says  that  his  daughter  is
    innocent and should not be punished. This is an empty point.  There  is
    no question of SS being punished.

164. Ms Bayati did not rely upon  any  factual  matters  that  do  not  fall
    within the scope of the exceptions I have  considered.  Once  again,  I
    remind myself of the impact on SC of the claimant's  removal  including
    the fact that she may find it difficult to remain in employment and may
    have to  rely  upon  financial  support  from  her  parents  and/or  on
    benefits.

165. I take into account the impact on SS  and,  in  this  regard,  what  Mr
    Shuttleworth says in his report. I take into account her best interests
    as a primary consideration.

166. I take into account the fact that Mr Clarke accepted, on behalf of  the
    Secretary of State, that it would be unduly harsh for SC and SS to live
    in Albania with the claimant. I take into account that this is a  happy
    family unit that will be fractured for years to  come.   On  the  other
    hand, it is relevant  also  to  bear  in  mind  that  deportation  does
    separate families.

167. I have taken  everything  into  account  whether  or  not  specifically
    referred to. Having taken everything into account and having given such
    weight as I consider  appropriate  to  the  relevant  factors,  I  have
    concluded that the claimant has failed to show that there are  features
    of his case that make his Article 8 claim especially strong. I  am  not
    satisfied that there are very compelling circumstances which would make
    his deportation a disproportionate  interference  with  his  Article  8
    rights  and  those  of  SC  and  SS,  considering  their  circumstances
    individually and collectively.

168.  I  therefore  re-make  the  decision  on  the  claimant's  appeal   by
    dismissing it.

169. Finally, as I said earlier, this is not a case in which the  assessment
    of credibility makes a difference  to  the  outcome.  Even  taking  the
    evidence before me at its highest, including:

    (i)    that SC is claustrophobic and would not be  able  to  travel  to
         Albania; therefore that this family  would  be  split  for  several
         years including during the period whilst SS is growing  up  without
         even the possibility of SC and SS visiting the claimant

    (ii)   that SC would have to give up work entirely  in  order  to  look
         after SS and thereby be  forced  to  rely  entirely  upon  benefits
         because she would  be  unable  to  look  to  her  parents  for  any
         financial support

    (iii)  that SS is very close to the claimant who is her primary  carer;
         she is closer the  him  than  she  is  to  SC;  and  she  would  be
         devastated emotionally if the claimant is removed

    (iv)   Mr Shuttleworth's opinion that "this could  well  have  a  major
         effect on [SS's]  emotional  development  which  is  clearly  at  a
         crucial stage at her present age"

    and taking into account the findings of Judge  Thomas,  including  that
    the best interests of SS  are  served  with  remaining  in  the  United
    Kingdom in the care of both of her parents, I would  have  reached  the
    same findings of fact in relation to each exception and  whether  there
    are very compelling circumstances over and  above  those  described  in
    paras 399 and 399A.

    Decision

    The decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal D  A  Thomas  involved
    the making of errors of law sufficient to require it to be  set  aside.
    Accordingly, the decision of  Judge  Thomas  to  allow  the  claimant's
    appeal against the respondent decision on human rights grounds was  set
    aside. I re-make the decision on  the  claimant's  appeal  against  the
    Secretary of State's decision by dismissing it on human rights grounds.

Upper Tribunal Judge Gill               Date: 11 August 2019

                                   Annex A


    SS.82 AND 86 OF THE 2002 ACT




    82 Right of appeal to the Tribunal

    (1)    A person ("P") may appeal to the Tribunal where-

         (a)      the Secretary of State has decided to refuse a protection
             claim made by P,

         (b)      the Secretary of State has decided to refuse a human
             rights claim made by P, or

         (c)      the Secretary of State has decided to revoke P's
             protection status.

    (2)    For the purposes of this Part-

         (a)      a "protection claim" is a claim made by a person ("P")
             that removal of P from the United Kingdom-

             (i) would breach the United Kingdom's obligations under the
                  Refugee Convention, or

             (ii)      would breach the United Kingdom's obligations in
                  relation to persons eligible for a grant of humanitarian
                  protection;

         (b)      P's protection claim is refused if the Secretary of State
             makes one or more of the following decisions-

             (i) that removal of P from the United Kingdom would not breach
                  the United Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee
                  Convention;

             (ii)      that removal of P from the United Kingdom would not
                  breach the United Kingdom's obligations in relation to
                  persons eligible for a grant of humanitarian protection;

         (c)      a person has "protection status" if the person has been
             granted leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom as a
             refugee or as a person eligible for a grant of humanitarian
             protection;

         (d)      humanitarian protection" is to be construed in accordance
             with the immigration rules;

         (e)      "refugee" has the same meaning as in the Refugee
             Convention.

    (3)    ...

    86 Determination of appeal

    (1)    This section applies on an appeal under section 82(1).

    (2)    The Tribunal must determine-

         (a)      any matter raised as a ground of appeal, and

         (b)      any matter which section 85 requires it to consider




    SS.117A-D OF THE 2002 ACT




    117A Application of this Part

    (1)    This Part applies where a court or tribunal is required to
         determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts -

         (a)      breaches a person's right to respect for private and
             family life under Article 8, and

         (b)      as a result would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human
             Rights Act 1998.

    (2)    In considering the public interest question, the court or
         tribunal must (in particular) have regard -

         (a)      in all cases, to the considerations listed in section
             117B, and

         (b)      in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals,
             to the considerations listed in section 117C.

    (3)    In subsection (2), "the public interest question" means the
         question of whether an interference with a person's right to
         respect for private and family life is justified under Article
         8(2).

    117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all cases

    (1)    The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the
         public interest.

    (2)    It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests
         of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who
         seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able to speak
         English, because persons who can speak English -

         (a)      are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

         (b)      are better able to integrate into society.

    (3)    It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests
         of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who
         seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are financially
         independent, because such persons -

         (a)      are not a burden on taxpayers, and

         (b)      are better able to integrate into society.

    (4)    Little weight should be given to -

         (a)      a private life, or

         (b)      a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

         that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
         United Kingdom unlawfully.

    (5)    Little weight should be given to a private life established by a
         person at a time when the person's immigration status is
         precarious.

    (6)    In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where -

         (a)      the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and

         (b)      it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave
             the United Kingdom.

    117C Article 8 additional considerations in cases involving foreign
    criminals.

    (1)    The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.

    (2)    The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.

    (3)    In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has not been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the
         public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or
         Exception 2 applies.

    (4)    Exception 1 applies where -

         (a)      C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for
             most of C's life,

         (b)      C is socially and culturally integrated in the United
             Kingdom, and

         (c)      there would be very significant obstacles to C's
             integration into the country to which C is proposed to be
             deported.

    (5)    Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

    (6)    In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public interest
         requires deportation unless there are very compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and
         2.

    (7)    The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be taken
         into account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to
         deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that the reason for
         the decision was the offence or offences for which the criminal has
         been convicted.

    117D Interpretation of this Part

    (1)    In this Part -

         "Article 8" means Article 8 of the European Convention on Human
         Rights;

         "qualifying child" means a person who is under the age of 18 and
         who -

         (a)      is a British citizen, or

         (b)      has lived in the United Kingdom for a continuous period of
             seven years or more;

         "qualifying partner" means a partner who -

         (a)      is a British citizen, or

         (b)      who is settled in the United Kingdom (within the meaning
             of the Immigration Act 1971 - see section 33(2A) of that Act).



    (2)    In this Part, "foreign criminal" means a person -

         (a)      who is not a British citizen,

         (b)      who has been convicted in the United Kingdom of an
             offence, and

         (c)      who -

             (i) has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least
                  12 months,

             (ii)      has been convicted of an offence that has caused
                  serious harm, or

             (iii)     is a persistent offender.

    (3)    For the purposes of subsection (2)(b), a person subject to an
         order under -

         (a)      section 5 of the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964
             (insanity etc),

         (b)      section 57 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995
             (insanity etc), or (c) Article 50A of the Mental Health
             (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 (insanity etc), has not been
             convicted of an offence.

    (4)    In this Part, references to a person who has been sentenced to a
         period of imprisonment of a certain length of time -

         (a)      do not include a person who has received a suspended
             sentence (unless a court subsequently orders that the sentence
             or any part of it (of whatever length) is to take effect);

         (b)      do not include a person who has been sentenced to a period
             of imprisonment of that length of time only by virtue of being
             sentenced to consecutive sentences amounting in aggregate to
             that length of time;

         (c)      include a person who is sentenced to detention, or ordered
             or directed to be detained, in an institution other than a
             prison (including, in particular, a hospital or an institution
             for young offenders) for that length of time; and

         (d)      include a person who is sentenced to imprisonment or
             detention, or ordered or directed to be detained, for an
             indeterminate period, provided that it may last for at least
             that length of time.

    (5)    If any question arises for the purposes of this Part as to
         whether a person is a British citizen, it is for the person
         asserting that fact to prove it."







    THE IMMIGRATION RULES RELATING TO DEPORTATION




    A362. Where Article 8 is raised in the  context  of  deportation  under
    Part 13 of these Rules, the claim under Article  8  will  only  succeed
    where the requirements of these rules as  at  28  July  2014  are  met,
    regardless of when the notice of intention to deport or the deportation
    order, as appropriate, was served.'

    Revocation of deportation order

    390. An application for revocation  of  a  deportation  order  will  be
    considered  in  the  light  of  all  the  circumstances  including  the
    following:

         (i)      the grounds on which the order was made;

         (ii)     any representations made in support of revocation;

         (iii)    the interests of the community, including the  maintenance
         of an effective immigration control;

         (iv)      the   interests   of   the   applicant,   including   any
         compassionate circumstances.

    390A. Where paragraph 398 applies the Secretary of State will  consider
    whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not, it will only
    be in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in maintaining
    the deportation order will be outweighed by other factors.

    391. In the case of a person who has been deported following conviction
    for a criminal offence, the continuation of a deportation order against
    that person will be the proper course:

         (a)      in the case of a conviction for an offence for  which  the
         person was sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of  less  than  4
         years, unless 10  years  have  elapsed  since  the  making  of  the
         deportation  order  when,  if  an  application  for  revocation  is
         received, consideration will be given on a case by  case  basis  to
         whether the deportation order should be maintained, or

         (b)      in the case of a conviction for an offence for  which  the
         person was sentenced to a period of  imprisonment  of  at  least  4
         years, at any time,

    unless, in either case, the continuation would be contrary to the Human
    Rights Convention or the Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status
    of Refugees, or there are other exceptional circumstances that mean the
    continuation is outweighed by compelling factors.

    391A. In other cases, revocation of the  order  will  not  normally  be
    authorised unless the situation has been materially altered, either  by
    a change of circumstances  since  the  order  was  made,  or  by  fresh
    information  coming  to  light  which  was  not  before  the  appellate
    authorities or the Secretary of State. The passage of  time  since  the
    person was deported may also in itself  amount  to  such  a  change  of
    circumstances as to warrant revocation of the order.

    392. Revocation of a deportation order  does  not  entitle  the  person
    concerned to re-enter the United Kingdom; it renders  him  eligible  to
    apply for  admission  under  the  Immigration  Rules.  Application  for
    revocation of the order may be made to the Entry Clearance  Officer  or
    direct to the Home Office.

    396. Where a person is liable to deportation the presumption  shall  be
    that the public interest requires deportation.  It  is  in  the  public
    interest to deport where the Secretary of State must make a deportation
    order in accordance with section 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007.

    397. A deportation order will not  be  made  if  the  person's  removal
    pursuant to the order would be contrary to the UK's  obligations  under
    the  Refugee  Convention  or  the  Human   Rights   Convention.   Where
    deportation would not be contrary to these obligations, it will only be
    in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in deportation is
    outweighed.

    A.398. These rules apply where:

         (a)      a foreign criminal liable to deportation claims  that  his
         deportation would be contrary to the United  Kingdom's  obligations
         under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention;

         (b)      a foreign criminal applies for a  deportation  order  made
         against him to be revoked.

    398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary  to
    the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the  Human  Rights  Convention,
    and

         (a)      the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive  to
         the public good and in the public interest because they  have  been
         convicted of an offence for which they have  been  sentenced  to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years;

         (b)      the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive  to
         the public good and in the public interest because they  have  been
         convicted of an offence for which they have  been  sentenced  to  a
         period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12 months;
         or

         (c)      the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive  to
         the public good and in the public interest because, in the view  of
         the Secretary of State, their offending has caused serious harm  or
         they are a persistent offender who shows a particular disregard for
         the law,

    the Secretary of State in assessing that claim  will  consider  whether
    paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not, the public  interest
    in deportation will only be outweighed by other factors where there are
    very  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those  described  in
    paragraphs 399 and 399A.

    399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies if -

         (a)       the  person  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
         relationship with a child under the age of 18 years who is  in  the
         UK and

             (i) the child is a British citizen; or

             (ii)      the child has lived in the UK  continuously  for  at
             least the 7  years  immediately  preceding  the  date  of  the
             immigration decision; and in either case

                  (a)  it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in the
                  country to which the person is to be deported; and

                  (b)  it would be unduly harsh for the child to  remain  in
                  the UK without the person who is to be deported; or

         (b)      the person has a genuine and subsisting relationship  with
         a partner who is in the UK and is a British citizen or  settled  in
         the UK, and

             (i) the relationship was formed at  a  time  when  the  person
             (deportee) was in the UK lawfully and their immigration status
             was not precarious; and

             (ii)      it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live in
             the country to which the person is to be deported, because  of
             compelling circumstances over and  above  those  described  in
             paragraph EX.2 of Appendix FM; and

             (iii)     it would be unduly harsh for that partner to  remain
             in the UK without the person who is to be deported.

    399A. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies if -



         (a)      the person has been lawfully resident in the UK  for  most
         of his life; and

         (b)      he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and

         (c)       there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles   to   his
         integration into  the  country  to  which  it  is  proposed  he  is
         deported.







    THE IMMIGRATION RULES IN NON-DEPORTATION CASES




    Para 276ADE of the Immigration Rules:

    276ADE (1). The requirements to be met by an  applicant  for  leave  to
    remain on the grounds of private life in the UK are that at the date of
    application, the applicant:

    (i)    does not fall for refusal under any of the grounds in Section S-
    LTR 1.2 to S-LTR 2.3. and S-LTR.3.1. in Appendix FM; and

    (ii)   has made a valid application for leave to remain on the  grounds
    of private life in the UK; and

    (iii)  has  lived  continuously  in  the  UK  for  at  least  20  years
    (discounting any period of imprisonment); or

    (iv)   is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously  in  the
    UK for at least 7 years (discounting any period of imprisonment) and it
    would not be reasonable to expect the applicant to leave the UK; or

    (v)    is aged 18 years or above and under 25 years and  has  spent  at
    least half of his life living continuously in the UK  (discounting  any
    period of imprisonment); or

    (vi)   subject to sub-paragraph (2), is aged 18  years  or  above,  has
    lived continuously in the UK for less than 20  years  (discounting  any
    period of imprisonment) but there would be very  significant  obstacles
    to the applicant's integration into the country to which he would  have
    to go if required to leave the UK




    Appendix FM, Exceptions EX.1 and EX.2

    Section EX: Exceptions to certain eligibility requirements for leave to
    remain as a partner or parent

    EX.1. This paragraph applies if

    (a)

         (i)      the  applicant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
         relationship with a child who-

             (aa)      is under the age of 18 years, or was under  the  age
             of 18 years when the applicant was first granted leave on  the
             basis that this paragraph applied;

             (bb)      is in the UK;

             (cc)      is  a  British  Citizen  or  has  lived  in  the  UK
             continuously for at least the 7  years  immediately  preceding
             the date of application; and

         (ii)     taking into account their  best  interests  as  a  primary
         consideration, it would not be reasonable to expect  the  child  to
         leave the UK; or

    (b)    the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship  with  a
    partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled in the UK or
    in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection, and there  are
    insurmountable obstacles to family life with  that  partner  continuing
    outside the UK.

    EX.2. For the purposes of paragraph EX.1.(b) "insurmountable obstacles"
    means the very significant difficulties which would  be  faced  by  the
    applicant or their partner in continuing  their  family  life  together
    outside the UK and which could not be overcome  or  would  entail  very
    serious hardship for the applicant or their partner.

                                  Anonymity

We make an order under r.14(1) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008 prohibiting the disclosure or publication of  any  matter  likely
to lead members of the public to identify the original appellant. No  report
of these proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  him.   This
direction applies to both the original appellant and to the  respondent  and
all other persons. Failure to comply  with  this  direction  could  lead  to
contempt of court proceedings.
We make this anonymity order because the decision  refers  to  the  original
appellant's minor daughter.
The parties at liberty to apply to discharge this order, with reasons.


Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.
For  the  respondent:     Mr  A.  Metzer  QC,  instructed  by  Appleby  Shaw
Solicitors.

                           Decision and Directions

 1. The Secretary of State  has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  the
    decision of Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Thomas  (hereafter  the
    "judge") who, in a decision promulgated on 27 September 2018  following
    a hearing on 16 August 2018, allowed the appeal of Mr  A  S  (hereafter
    the "claimant"), a national of Albania born on 3 July 1984,  against  a
    decision of the respondent of 31 January 2018 to  refuse  to  revoke  a
    deportation order signed on 8  January  2010  (served  on  10  February
    2010).

 2. In the decision letter, the  respondent  considered  and  rejected  the
    claimant's private and family life claim under Article 8  of  the  1950
    European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and  Fundamental
    Freedoms (ECHR). The claimant's family life  claim  was  based  on  his
    relationship with his partner ("SC") and his daughter ("SS") by SC born
    on 26 May 2016.

 3. Deportation proceedings were commenced against the  claimant  following
    his conviction at Channel Juvenile Court of an offence of possession of
    a false instrument. On 17 October 2006, he was sentenced to a  12-month
    Detention and Training Order ("DTO").

 4. As will be seen, the judge decided that the claimant was not a "foreign
    criminal"  for  the  purposes  of  paras  398,  399  and  399A  of  the
    Immigration Rules and that section 117C of the Nationality, Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 (the "2002 Act") did not apply.

 5. We have not considered it necessary to set  out  the  full  immigration
    history.

Ambit of the grant of permission

 6. An issue arose before us as to whether the grant of permission by Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal Lambert was limited to the issue  raised  in
    paras 1-3 of the grounds, i.e. Ground 1 as set out at para 18(i) below,
    that the judge materially erred in law by failing to treat the claimant
    as a foreign criminal.

 7. In the section of the standard form  document,  Judge  Lambert  stated:
    "Permission to appeal  is  GRANTED".  Judge  Lambert  said,  under  the
    heading "Reasons for decision", as follows:

         "1.      ...

         2. Paragraphs 1-3 of the grounds take issue with the  finding  made
             by the Judge at paragraph 22 that [the  claimant's]  12  month
             detention and training  order  did  not  make  him  a  foreign
             criminal within paragraph 398(b) 'because his  sentence  falls
             short of 12 months' imprisonment'. It appears that  the  judge
             has misread sub paragraph (b) which refers to  a  sentence  of
             'at least 12 months'. The ground is arguable and material.

         3. The remaining grounds may amount to no more than a  disagreement
             with the judges's [sic] finding.

         4. There is therefore an arguable error of  law  disclosed  by  the
             application."

 8. Mr Metzer submitted that the grant of permission was limited to  Ground
    1. He accepted that the decision of the President  and  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Dawson in Safi and others (permission to appeal decisions) [2018]
    UKUT 00388 (IAC) applies. However, he submitted that it was clear  from
    para 3 of Judge Lambert's  decision  that  she  did  not  consider  the
    remaining  grounds  arguable.  Para  4  of  Judge  Lambert's   decision
    referring  to  "...  an  arguable  error  of  law..."  shows  that  she
    considered that only one ground was arguable.

 9. We decided that the grant of permission was  a  general  grant,  as  we
    stated at the hearing. We shall now give our reasons for that decision.



10. In the first place, we do not consider that the  "Reasons"  section  of
    Judge Lambert's decision was, on its face, unambiguous. This is because
    para 3 states that "The remaining grounds may amount  to  more  than  a
    disagreement..."  (our  emphasis).  If  she  had  intended  to   refuse
    permission on the remaining grounds,  clearer  words  would  have  been
    needed to the effect that the remaining grounds  were  unarguable,  not
    merely that "[they] may amount to more than a disagreement...". In  our
    view, para 3 is consistent with Judge Lambert merely expressing a  view
    about the merits of the remaining grounds. On the other  hand,  para  4
    casts some ambiguity, in  that,  it  refers  in  the  singular  to  "an
    arguable error of law". Where there is some ambiguity, this  should  be
    resolved in favour of the applicant, as the Court  of  Appeal  held  at
    para 77 of SSHD v Rodriguez; Mandalia and Patel v SSHD [2014] EWCA  Civ
    2, referred to at para 22 of Safi and applied by the  Tribunal  in  the
    Safi decision. The fact that the applicant is the  Secretary  of  State
    makes no difference, in our view.

11. We are therefore of the view that para 46 of Safi applies. This reads:

         "Henceforth,  it  is  likely  to  be  only  in   very   exceptional
         circumstances  that  the  Upper  Tribunal  will  be  persuaded   to
         entertain a submission that a decision which, on its  face,  grants
         permission to appeal without express limitation is to be  construed
         as anything other than a grant of permission on all of the  grounds
         accompanying the application for permission.  That is highly likely
         to be so, regardless of  what  may  be  said  in  the  reasons  for
         decision section of the document."

12. In our judgement, there were no such "very  exceptional  circumstances"
    nor did Mr Metzer suggest that there were.

13. In any event, even if we are wrong in our reasons as  given  above,  we
    exercised our discretion to entertain  the  remaining  grounds,  having
    taken into account the fact that Mr Metzer said that he was prepared to
    deal with the remaining grounds, as he had submitted a response to  the
    Secretary of State's grounds which dealt with all of the grounds.

The judge's decision

14. The judge considered that the claimant was not a "foreign criminal" for
    the purposes of paras 398, 399 and 399A of the Immigration Rules  (para
    22 of her decision). In her view, the claimant's sentence fell short of
    12 months' imprisonment. She therefore concluded that  paras  398,  399
    and 399A did not  apply  to  the  claimant  (para  22  of  the  judge's
    decision) and proceeded to consider the claimant's Article 8  claim  in
    line with the approach explained in Razgar [2004] UKHL  27  and  Hesham
    Ali (Iraq) v SSHD [2016] UKSC60, at paras 23-30 of  her  decision.  She
    found, inter alia, that the claimant enjoyed family life with SC and SS
    (para 23).

15. At para 25, in relation to proportionality, the  judge  considered  the
    care the claimant provides for SS; that SS is  a  British  citizen  and
    entitled to the benefits and entitlements of her nationality; her  best
    interests were to remain in the care of  both  parents  in  the  United
    Kingdom; and that deportation would  result  in  a  lengthy  separation
    between SS and the claimant which she considered would not  be  in  the
    best interests of SS. At para 26, the judge considered  the  fact  that
    the claimant had two offences for using a false instrument, one in  the
    United Kingdom and one in Holland for which he was sentenced to  a  DTO
    in the United Kingdom and 14  months'  imprisonment  in  Holland;  that
    these offences were committed between 2006 and 2008; and that there had
    been no further offending in the past 10 years. In these circumstances,
    she said that she did not find that  the  claimant  was  a  "persistent
    offender" and therefore that s.117C of the 2002 Act does not apply.

16. At para 27, the judge took into account, in the claimant's favour,  the
    fact that he speaks English and has work skills, which she  said  would
    aid integration; and that little weight  was  to  be  accorded  to  his
    private life and family life with SC  because  such  private  life  and
    family life had been established whilst he was in  the  United  Kingdom
    unlawfully. At para 28, she said that she weighed in  the  balance  the
    fact that the claimant's deportation is deemed to be conducive  to  the
    public good because of his lack of a right of abode, that  he  had  re-
    entered the United Kingdom illegally in July 2010 and has remained here
    since; and that he re-entered the  United  Kingdom  in  breach  of  the
    deportation order. At para 29, she said that she weighed in the balance
    the length of time that has passed since the claimant's offences in the
    United  Kingdom  and  in  Holland  which,  in   her   view,   indicated
    rehabilitation. She noted that the claimant now has a genuine passport.
    At para 30, she said:

         "I have considered all relevant factors, and find (a)  the  child's
         best  interests  and  (b)  the  age  of  the  offence,  amount   to
         exceptional circumstances that just tips the  balance  against  the
         public interest in [the  claimant's]  removal  in  this  particular
         case. For these reasons, I find that the decision breaches  Article
         8 ECHR".

         (Our emphasis)

17. It is therefore plain that the judge did  consider,  as  she  said  she
    would, the claimant's Article 8 claim in a  free-standing  way  outside
    the scheme set out in the Immigration Rules, in particular, paras  398,
    399 and 399A.

The grounds and the claimant's written response

18. Mr Clarke informed us that he did not pursue  paras  8  and  9  of  the
    grounds. He pursued the remaining grounds which may  be  summarised  as
    follows:

    (i)    (Ground 1, paras 1-3 of the grounds) The judge erred in  law  by
         failing to treat the claimant as a foreign criminal as  defined  in
         s.117D(2)-(4) of the 2002  Act.  She  therefore  erred  in  law  in
         failing to apply paras 398, 399 and 399A of the  Immigration  Rules
         and s.117C of the 2002 Act.

    (ii)   (Ground 2, para 5 of the  grounds)  The  judge  failed  to  give
         adequate reasons why family life could not continue in Albania.  SS
         was only two years old and therefore had not started her  education
         yet. There was no evidence before the judge of the effect that  the
         claimant's deportation would have on SS. There  was  nothing  which
         would allow the claimant's circumstances  to  overcome  the  public
         interest.

    (iii)  (Ground 3, para 10 of the grounds) The  judge  erred  in  taking
         into account, in the claimant's favour, the  fact  that  he  speaks
         English because this is neutral factor, as the Court of Appeal held
         in Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803.

    (iv)   (Ground 4, para 11 of the grounds) The judge failed to take into
         account the fact that the claimant is not financially  independent.
         This is a reference to s.117B(3) of the 2002 Act.

    (v)    (Ground 5, final sentence of para 4 of the  grounds)  The  judge
         failed to consider the question of revocation.

19. In relation to Ground 1, the claimant's response dated 14 January  2019
    under rule 24 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
    (hereafter the "Reply")  conceded  that  a  12-month  DTO  brought  the
    claimant within the definition of "foreign criminal" in s.117D  of  the
    2002, that s.117C therefore applies and  that  the  judge  should  have
    considered paras 398 and 399 of the Immigration Rules.

20. However, it is said, for the reasons  given  in  the  Reply,  that  the
    judge's error was not material. In summary, the Reply relies  upon  the
    evidence of:

    (i)    SC who said that SS could not move to  Albania  because  of  the
         strong ties to  family  in  the  United  Kingdom,  the  patriarchal
         society in Albania and discrimination that SS would be subjected to
         as a woman; and  that  as  a  result,  SC  would  not  permit  such
         relocation;

    (ii)   Mr Roy Shuttleworth, Clinical Consultant,  who  stated,  in  his
         report dated 27 July 2018, that, although SS was  clearly  attached
         to her mother, she is much more attached to her father;  that  this
         was demonstrated by a  "nice,  warm,  tactile  relationship";  that
         given SS's age, she would be devastated emotionally if  her  father
         were  to  leave  which  may  have  an  effect  on   her   emotional
         development; that, furthermore, separation of a stable family  unit
         would cause major disruption in itself;  that  SS  does  not  speak
         Albanian and would find  the  culture  strange;  and  that  medical
         facilities and appropriate education for SS would also be difficult
         to find.

21. The Reply contends (para 23) that the judge had considered all  of  the
    evidence and submissions of the parties and  had  made  a  finding,  at
    least by clear implication, that it would be unduly harsh on SS for the
    claimant to be deported. At para 27, the Reply contends that,  even  if
    the judge had considered s.117C of the 2002 Act and  para  399  of  the
    Immigration Rules, she would have reached the conclusion that it  would
    be unduly harsh on SS if the claimant were to be deported.

22. In relation to Ground 2, the Reply contends (paras 30 and  33-34)  that
    the judge heard a  considerable  amount  of  evidence.  She  was  fully
    entitled to reach her findings of fact. The effects of  the  claimant's
    deportation on SS constituted a major part of the hearing.

23. In relation to Ground 3, the Reply draws attention  to  the  fact  that
    s.117B(2)  clearly  emphasises  the  fact  that  the  English  language
    requirement is in the public interest because persons who are  able  to
    speak English are less of a burden on tax-payers and able to  integrate
    into society.  In  any  event,  the  judge  considered  the  claimant's
    knowledge of English in the round along with the rest of the  evidence.



24. In relation to Ground 4, the  Reply  contends,  inter  alia,  that  the
    claimant's family were not a burden on the  taxpayer  on  the  evidence
    before the judge. Although the claimant relied  upon  SC,  he  was  not
    financially dependent in the sense of being a burden on the taxpayer.

Submissions

25. In  relation  to  Ground  1,  Mr  Clarke  submitted  that  the  judge's
    assessment of the impact  on  SS  of  the  claimant's  deportation  was
    limited to considering her best interests, whereas the test she  should
    have applied pursuant  to  s.117C(5)  is  whether  the  effect  of  the
    claimant's deportation on SS would be unduly harsh. The  Supreme  Court
    held in KO (Nigeria) and others v SSHD [2018] UKSC 53  that  the  Upper
    Tribunal had correctly stated the threshold to be applied in MK (Sierra
    Leone) v SSHD [2015] UKUT 223. The judge had  not  even  mentioned  the
    threshold in her decision. He submitted that, in  the  absence  of  any
    findings as to whether the effect of the claimant's  deportation  would
    be unduly harsh on SS, it was impossible to see how a mere  finding  as
    to the best interests of SS was sufficient to  show  that  the  judge's
    error was immaterial.

26. Mr Clarke submitted that Ground 2 followed from Ground 1. He  submitted
    that, irrespective  of  whether  or  not  there  was  any  evidence  to
    establish the effect on SS of being separated from  the  claimant,  the
    fact was that there was no reasoning to explain why the impact on SS of
    the claimant's deportation would be unduly harsh. There was no  mention
    of the applicable threshold for undue hardship or any applicable  case-
    law.

27. Mr Clarke continued to rely on Grounds 3 and  4  as  explained  in  the
    written grounds.

28. Mr Clarke drew our attention to para  44  of  KO  (Nigeria)  where  the
    Supreme Court held that the Secretary of State's concession  in  Sanade
    (British children - Zambrano - Dereci) [2012] UKUT 48,  to  the  effect
    that a British citizen child could not be expected to relocate  outside
    the United Kingdom, was made in error.  He  informed  us  that  he  was
    restricted by Home Office guidance to the effect that  British  citizen
    children should not be expected to leave the territory of the  European
    Union.

29. In response, Mr Metzer submitted that the Secretary of State's guidance
    was nevertheless relevant to proportionality.

30. In relation to Ground 1, Mr Metzer took us through  the  report  of  Mr
    Shuttleworth. He submitted that it was clear from the report  that,  as
    SC is the breadwinner,  SS  is  often  with  the  claimant.  The  judge
    summarised the report at para 10 of her decision. Although she did  not
    refer to it subsequently in her assessment of  the  appeal,  Mr  Metzer
    submitted that the report did "find its way" into the judge's findings,
    as indicated, for example, by the third sentence  of  para  24  of  her
    decision where she said: "The [claimant] plays a  significant  role  in
    [SS'] upbringing and is her main carer whilst her mother  works";  para
    30 where she said "I have considered all relevant factors..."; and  her
    references to the best interests of SS which, he submitted, were  based
    on Mr Shuttleworth's report. Accordingly,  Mr  Metzer  submitted  that,
    even if the judge had considered whether the impact of  the  claimant's
    deportation would be unduly harsh on SS, she would have concluded  that
    it was.

31. In response, Mr Clarke submitted that the  judge's  decision  does  not
    refer to the reasoning advanced by Mr Metzer. He reminded us  that  the
    Court of Appeal has held that it  would  be  very  rare  for  the  best
    interests of a child to outweigh the public interest in deportation.

32. We reserved  our  decision  on  the  question  whether  the  judge  had
    materially erred in law.

33. We asked the parties to address us on the appropriate  disposal  if  we
    were to conclude that the judge had materially erred in  law.  In  such
    event, both agreed that:

    (i)    the judge's findings as set out at para 22 of the  Reply  should
         stand; and

    (ii)   the judge's summary of the oral evidence at  paras  5-9  of  her
         decision should stand as the record of the oral evidence  given  at
         the hearing before the judge.

34. As to whether the appeal should be remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal
    for the decision on the appeal to  be  re-made  or  whether  the  Upper
    Tribunal should re-make the decision, we pointed out that the fact that
    the claimant was successful before the judge may justify  remittal.  On
    the other hand, the fact that the issues to be considered were  limited
    and that certain findings were to  be  preserved  suggest  that  it  is
    appropriate for the Upper Tribunal to re-make the decision.

35. Mr Metzer agreed that, if a material error of law was found, we  should
    retain this appeal in the Upper Tribunal and that  the  Upper  Tribunal
    should re-make the decision on the appeal.

Assessment

36. As will be seen from our summary of the submissions at the hearing,  Mr
    Clarke did not address us on Ground 5 although he said that  he  relied
    upon the written grounds and did not say that he withdrew any  part  of
    para 4 of the grounds.

37. Ground 5 states that the judge  failed  to  consider  the  question  of
    revocation. The decision letter refers to paras 390  and  390A  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  Ground  5  makes  no  material  difference  to  our
    assessment of whether the judge had  materially  erred  in  law,  given
    that: (i) Mr Metzer accepted that the claimant fell to be treated as  a
    foreign criminal and therefore that  para  398(b)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules applies; (ii) para 390A of the  Immigration  Rules  provides,  in
    respect of decisions to refuse to revoke  a  deportation  order,  that,
    where para 398 applies, the Secretary of State  will  consider  whether
    para 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not, it will  be  only  be  in
    exceptional circumstances that the public interest in  maintaining  the
    deportation order will be outweighed by other factors;  and  (iii)  the
    question whether the judge  materially  erred  in  law  in  failing  to
    consider and apply para 399(a) is the subject of  Ground  1  which  the
    parties did address at the hearing.

38. We therefore turn to Ground 1.

39. Section 117C provides (insofar as relevant to the issues before us,  as
    follows:

         117C Article 8 additional considerations in cases involving foreign
         criminals.

         (1)      The deportation of foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
         interest.

         (2)      The more  serious  the  offence  committed  by  a  foreign
         criminal, the greater is the public interest in deportation of  the
         criminal.

         (3)      In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has  not  been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,  the
         public interest requires C's  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
         Exception 2 applies.

         (4)      Exception 1 applies where-

             (a) ...,

             (b) ..., and

             (c) ....

         (5)      Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

         (6)      In the case of a foreign criminal who has  been  sentenced
         to a period of imprisonment of at  least  four  years,  the  public
         interest requires deportation  unless  there  are  very  compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2.

         (7)      ...

40. It is clear from KO (Nigeria) that the general rules in  s.117B(1)  and
    (2) have been reflected by the enactment of the categories of  "foreign
    criminal", defined by reference to whether or not their sentences  were
    of four years or more, and two precisely defined exceptions in  S.117C,
    that the two exceptions are free-standing and that the public  interest
    therefore does not fall for further consideration in  deciding  whether
    one or both of the exceptions apply. This is not in dispute between the
    parties.

41. We pause here to stress that, pursuant to the Supreme Court's  judgment
    in KO (Nigeria), the term "unduly harsh" in  s.117C(5)  therefore  sets
    the threshold that takes account of the weight of the  public  interest
    in deportation cases. In other words, the weight of the public interest
    is fixed by the creation of the categories of  "foreign  criminal"  and
    the exceptions in s.117C. There is no room for a  judge  to  give  such
    weight as he or she considers is the appropriate weight to  the  public
    interest in the particular circumstances of a case.

42. It is clear from KO (Nigeria) that the term "unduly harsh" in Exception
    2 in s.117C(5) of the 2002 Act sets a high threshold. As  the  Tribunal
    said in MK (Sierra Leone):

         "'unduly harsh' does not equate with  uncomfortable,  inconvenient,
         undesirable or merely difficult. Rather, it  poses  a  considerably
         more elevated threshold. 'Harsh' in this context, denotes something
         severe, or bleak. It is the antithesis of pleasant or  comfortable.
         Furthermore, the addition of the adverb 'unduly' raises an  already
         elevated standard still higher."

43. It follows from the above that the judge's failure to apply Exception 2
    in s.117C(5) and consider whether the claimant's deportation  would  be
    unduly harsh on SS means that she failed to give appropriate weight  to
    the public interest. She made her own decision  on  the  weight  to  be
    given to the public interest in  a  free-standing  way  which,  in  our
    judgment, is simply impermissible  in  view  of  the  judgment  of  the
    Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria). This is a fundamental, and fatal,  error
    of law, in our judgment.

44. Mr Metzer sought to persuade  us  that  the  error  was  not  material,
    referring in detail to the report of Mr Shuttleworth  that  was  before
    the judge and the judge's findings. There are several difficulties with
    his submissions which  we  concluded  are  not  well-founded,  for  the
    following reasons:

45. In the first place, Mr Metzer's submissions  ignore  the  ratio  in  KO
    (Nigeria) (see our paras 40-41 above). The judge's  assessment  of  the
    claimant's Article 8 claim was wholly uninformed by the weight that  is
    accorded to the public interest in deportation by the scheme  in  paras
    398, 399 and 399A, i.e. the creation  of  the  categories  of  "foreign
    criminal" and the two exceptions in s.117C. As we have said,  she  made
    her own decision on the weight to be given to the public interest in  a
    free-standing way  which,  as  we  have  also  said,  is  impermissible
    following the judgment in KO (Nigeria).

46. In the second place, Mr Metzer was,  in  effect,  suggesting  that  the
    judge's consideration of the best interests of SS was equivalent  to  a
    proper consideration of the relevant threshold in deciding whether  the
    claimant's deportation would be unduly harsh on SS. However,  the  fact
    is that it is impossible to equate the two. Consideration of  the  best
    interests of a child is part of an assessment  of  whether  deportation
    would be unduly harsh on the child but the fact is  that  the  two  are
    separate considerations. Furthermore, there is an applicable  threshold
    in deciding whether the impact of a parent's deportation will be unduly
    harsh on a child whereas there is no threshold applicable  in  deciding
    what is in the best interests of a child.

47. Thirdly, given the high threshold applicable in  deciding  whether  the
    impact on SS of the claimant's deportation would be  unduly  harsh,  it
    simply cannot be  said,  on  the  evidence  before  her  including  the
    evidence of SC and (which we accept the judge did  take  into  account)
    the report of Mr Shuttleworth that, if the judge had considered whether
    Exception 2 applied and decided whether  deportation  would  be  unduly
    harsh on SS, she would inevitably have reached the same conclusion.  We
    have to be circumspect in what we say about the content of the evidence
    of SC and Mr Shuttleworth, given that the decision will be  re-made  in
    the Upper Tribunal (see below), less it be said that we have pre-judged
    their evidence in advance of the resumed hearing. We can  and  do  say,
    however, that the evidence is such that the judge may or may  not  have
    concluded that it would be unduly  harsh  on  SS  if  the  claimant  is
    deported. What is clear is that it is not  inevitable  that  she  would
    have concluded that deportation would be unduly harsh on  SS.  This  is
    what Mr Metzer would need to establish in order to persuade us that the
    judge would have reached the same conclusion, which he failed to do.

48. This is especially so given that, at para 30 of her decision, the judge
    said that the best interests of SS and the age of the offence amount to
    "exceptional circumstances that  just  tips  the  balance  against  the
    public interest in [the claimant's] removal". Not only does  this  make
    clear  that  the  threshold  she  applied  was  the  different  one  of
    "exceptional circumstances" applicable in a free-standing consideration
    of Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules, she concluded that the  two
    factors she mentioned at para 30 (the best interests of SS and the  age
    of the offence) "just tipped the balance..." (our emphasis).

49. Accordingly, in our judgment, there is no room for any view to be taken
    of the judge's error in failing to treat  the  claimant  as  a  foreign
    criminal other than that it was material, irrespective of Grounds 2,  3
    and 4. For the reasons given above, we reject  Mr  Metzer's  submission
    that the judge made a finding, at least by implication, that  it  would
    be unduly harsh on SS if the claimant were to be deported.

50. Accordingly, it is not necessary, strictly speaking,  for  us  to  rely
    upon Grounds 2, 3 and 4 to set aside the judge's decision.

51. However, we will proceed to consider Grounds 2-4.

52. We agree with Mr Clarke that Ground 2  follows  from  Ground  1.  As  a
    consequence of the error she made in relation to  Ground  1,  which  we
    have decided was material in itself, we are satisfied  that  the  judge
    materially erred in law by failing to give  adequate  reasons  for  her
    finding that family life could not continue in Albania.

53. We note that Mr Clarke said that he was restricted in arguing  that  it
    would be reasonable for SS to relocate outside  the  territory  of  the
    European Union due to Home Office guidance to the effect  that  British
    citizen children should not be expected to leave the territory  of  the
    European Union. Mr Metzer submitted that the Home Office  guidance  was
    relevant in deciding proportionality. However,  we  are  bound  by  the
    judgment of the Supreme Court  in  KO  (Nigeria).  At  para  44  of  KO
    (Nigeria), the Supreme Court held that the  concession  in  Sanade  was
    made in error. Accordingly, the Secretary of  State's  guidance  cannot
    bind judges of the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal.

54. Ground 2 is therefore established.

55. In relation to Ground 3, Mr Metzer's submissions and the submissions in
    the Reply are misconceived as they ignore the judgment of the Court  of
    Appeal in Rhuppiah to the effect that the fact that a person can  speak
    English is a neutral factor.  The  judge  therefore  plainly  erred  in
    taking into account in the claimant's favour the fact  that  he  speaks
    English. On its own, this may not have been material to the outcome, if
    the judge had considered Exception 2 and not made the  material  errors
    she made in relation to Grounds 1 and 2. However, the fact is that  she
    did make those material errors. Her  error  in  relation  to  Ground  3
    simply adds to the already determinative case  for  setting  aside  her
    decision.

56. We are satisfied that there is no substance in Ground 4  given,  as  Mr
    Metzer submitted, there was no  evidence  before  the  judge  that  the
    claimant and his family were a burden on the taxpayer and  that  he  is
    dependent on SC.

57. For all of the above reasons, we set aside the decision of Judge Thomas
    to allow the  appeal  on  human  rights  grounds  in  relation  to  the
    claimant's rights under Article 8.

58. We direct that:

    (i)    The judge's summary of the evidence she heard at  paras  5-9  of
         her decision shall stand as a record of the evidence given  to  the
         First-tier Tribunal.

    (ii)   The following findings shall also stand as Mr Metzer submitted:

         a) at para 23, that the  claimant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
             relationship with SC and SS.

         b) at paras 24, the findings made by the judge as follows:

                  "... Despite her age, [SS]  will  be  familiar  with  [the
                  claimant] as her father. She has a real relationship  with
                  her maternal grandparents who are settled in the UK. As  a
                  British citizen  she  is  entitled  to  the  benefits  and
                  entitlements of her nationality. Her  best  interests  are
                  served with her remaining in the care of both  parents  in
                  the UK".

59. Mr Metzer and Mr Clarke agreed that, in the  event  that  we  concluded
    that the judge had materially erred in law and set aside her  decision,
    the Upper Tribunal should re-make the decision on the appeal. We see no
    reason why the appeal should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

60. Since the  Upper  Tribunal  will  be  re-making  the  decision  on  the
    claimant's appeal, the parties' attention is drawn  to  the  revocation
    provisions in paras  390-392  which,  it  would  seem,  are  applicable
    notwithstanding that the claimant is presently in the  United  Kingdom,
    in addition to paras 398, 399 and 399A and the exceptions in s.117C  of
    the 2002 Act. In addition, as stated above, the Upper Tribunal is bound
    by para 44 of the Supreme Court's judgment in KO (Nigeria).

61. This appeal will be listed for a further (or  resumed)  hearing  before
    Upper Tribunal Judge Gill, sitting alone.
