                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a determination
        of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Newberry  promulgated  following  a
        hearing at Taylor House on the 9th January 2014, in which the Judge
        allowed the appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds.


     2. The decision is challenged by the Secretary of State on  the  basis
        that although the Judge noted the  reasons  why  the  Secretary  of
        State  had  refused  the  application  under  Appendix  FM  of  the
        Immigration Rules, this fact does not feature in the determination.
         The Judge failed to follow the correct approach when assessing  an
        Article 8 claim and  did  not  consider  whether  there  were  good
        grounds for granting leave outside the Rules or  the  existence  of
        compelling circumstances not recognised under the Rules.



Background


     3. Mr Nelson, who was born on 24th September 1949,  is  a  citizen  of
        Venezuela. His wife was born on 5th November 1951 and is a  citizen
        of Venezuela too.  Their immigration histories show that Mr  Nelson
        entered the United Kingdom lawfully  on  28th  January  2001  as  a
        visitor. His leave was extended following a successful appeal until
        31st October 2003, as a student. Since this date  he  has  been  an
        overstayer. Mrs Nelson joined her husband in the  UK  approximately
        six months after his arrival and presumably was  granted  leave  in
        line. She brought their two children with her who are now over  the
        age of 18.


     4. On 31st August 2012 an application was made  for  leave  to  remain
        under Article 8 ECHR. This was refused by the Secretary of State in
        a refusal letter  dated  the  29th  October  2013  under  both  the
        Immigration Rules and Article 8 ECHR when considering whether there
        were any exceptional circumstances.


     5. Having heard evidence and the advocate's submissions it appears the
        Judge's findings are set  out  in  paragraphs  18  and  19  of  the
        determination in the following terms:


              18. The Appellant and his family have been  in  the  UK  since
   2001, almost                 14  years.  There  is  no  doubt  they  have
   established a family life as well                   as  a  private  life.
   The First Appellant is a self-employed electrician                    and
   has not  been  in  receipt  of  benefits.  The  children  of  the  family
     have been educated in the UK and his son is due to  attend  university.
              Both Appellants are closely involved with the  care  of  their
                  grandchildren, one of whom is unwell and hospitalised from
   time to                 time.


              19. Were the Appellant to be returned, he would have  no  home
   and no                  wider family support.   His  children,  with  one
   exception, do not live                in Venezuela.  The business he  has
   successfully built up over the                years would be  lost.  Both
   Appellants are deeply involved in the                  church and  it  is
   not    challenged    that    they    are    involved    in     charitable
   work, in addition to regular  churchgoing.  In  my  view,  the  severance
     from their children  and  grandchildren  would  be  particularly  harsh
     and in my view disproportionate in the context  of  a  long  period  of
          continual residence.







Discussion



     6. There are a number of clear errors in the determination.  The first
        of these is structural in that the Judge appears to note  the  fact
        the appeal was refused under the Immigration Rules but then, having
        set out the Razgar principles, proceeds  to  determine  it  on  the
        basis of Article 8 ECHR, without more.


     7. The Judge was required to consider the merits of the  human  rights
        claim in accordance with the approach  set  out  by  the  Court  of
        Appeal in MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ  1192,  the  High  Court  in
        Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) and by the Upper Tribunal in  Gulshan
        [2013] UKUT 640, as confirmed by Shahzad (Art  8:  legitimate  aim)
        [2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC).  These judgments have made it  clear  that
        the question of proportionality must be looked at in the context of
        the Immigration  Rules  with  no  need  to  go  on  to  a  specific
        assessment under Article 8 if it is clear from the facts that there
        are no particular compelling or exceptional circumstances requiring
        that course to be taken.


     8. That approach is consistent with what the Court of Appeal  said  in
        MF  (Nigeria)  and  with  the  approach  of  the  House  of  Lords,
        particularly in cases such as  Huang  [2007]  UKHL  11  and  Razgar
        [2004] UKHL 27.  In Shahzad it was found that where an area of  the
        Rules does not have such an express mechanism such as that found in
        the deportation provisions, the approach  in  Nagre  ([29]-[31]  in
        particular) and Gulshan should be followed: i.e. after applying the
        requirements of the Rules, only  if  there  may  be  arguably  good
        grounds for granting leave to remain outside them is  it  necessary
        for Article 8 purposes to go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are
        compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them.


     9. The starting position for the Judge was to look at  the  Rules  and
        see whether the Applicant was able to meet their  requirements.  If
        not, the question arises whether  the  decision  would  lead  to  a
        breach of Article 8 but in the context of whether there are factors
        not covered by the Rules which give rise to the  need  to  consider
        Article 8 further.


    10. The key question in relation to the  assessment  of  Article  8  is
        whether the decision to  refuse  to  grant  leave  will  result  in
        compelling  circumstances  giving  rise  to   unjustifiably   harsh
        consequences for the Applicant or any family  member,  such  as  to
        establish an arguable case at this time.  In Gulshan  it  was  held
        that the term "insurmountable obstacles"  in  provisions  such  as
        Section EX.1 are not obstacles which  are  impossible  to  surmount
        They concern the practical  possibilities  of  relocation.  In  the
        absence of such insurmountable obstacles, it is necessary  to  show
        other  non-standard  and  particular  features  demonstrating  that
        removal will be unjustifiably harsh. The material provided  to  the
        Judge did not arguably establish that such circumstances exist.


    11. The second error is that even if the Judge was entitled to consider
        the merits of the appeal by reference to Article 8 ECHR he fails to
        particularise the nature of the family and  private  life  that  he
        claims exists in paragraph 18 and appears to go on to  undertake  a
        proportionately balancing exercise in paragraph 19 in the  briefest
        of terms without giving adequate  reasons  for  findings  made  and
        making no mention whatsoever of the weight given to  the  Secretary
        of State's case which is a relevant part of any properly  conducted
        proportionality exercise under Article 8 ECHR.


    12. Mr Malik, whilst not conceding any error, properly recognised  that
        the Judge had erred in his approach and assessment to the  evidence
        but submitted that any error was not material, on the basis that if
        the exercise was properly conducted the result will be exactly  the
        same.


    13. When asked to specify the nature of the human  rights  that  it  is
        claimed exist it was  submitted  that  these  include  family  life
        between both  Appellants  and  their  children  and  grandchildren.
        Private  life  included  their  ties  to  the  church,  the   First
        Appellants electricians business in the United Kingdom,  the  house
        they have purchased, and the life  they  have  established  in  the
        United Kingdom during the time they have been here.


    14. Length of residence in the UK is a matter that is now  incorporated
        into the Immigration Rules.  It is also  a  relevant  consideration
        the majority of the private life they seek to rely  upon  has  been
        acquired during a time when they had no lawful leave to  remain  in
        the United Kingdom.   Their  immigration  history  shows  that  for
        approximately ten years they have been overstays with no legitimate
        expectation that they will be permitted to remain or  lawful  right
        to do so. They have therefore developed the life they now have, and
        are seeking to protect, knowing their situation is precarious.


    15. In relation to the children; their son is over  18  years  of  age,
        lives with them in their property in the United Kingdom, and  hopes
        to start university in September 2014.  It is settled jurisprudence
        that Article 8 does not given an individual the right to choose the
        country in which they live and neither is there a right for a  non-
        national to be educated in this country. Their  son  has  leave  to
        remain until 23rd October 2016 but it was not established  that  he
        cannot  attend  university  in  Venezuela  or  that  it   will   be
        unreasonable in all the circumstances to expect him to do so.  This
        is not a case in which an individual is halfway through a course of
        education as his university education has  yet  to  be  started.  I
        accept that further to the decision of the European Court of  Human
        Rights  in  AA  v  United  Kingdom  individuals  circumstances  can
        establish that family life continues to exist between him  and  his
        parents, notwithstanding having attained the age of majority.


    16. In relation to  the  Appellants'  daughter;  she  is  over  18  and
        independent having her own home and family. It was not  established
        that the relationship between the Appellants and their daughter  is
        anything other than one of the  normal  emotional  ties  one  would
        expect between parents and their children in a close  family  unit.
        It is not been established  on  the  evidence  that  the  necessary
        degree of dependency exists to satisfy the requirement  for  family
        life recognised by Article 8.


    17. The relationship with the children does fall outside the  Rules  as
        they  are  both  adults  as  does   the   relationship   with   the
        grandchildren.  This latter  claim  is  based  upon  the  fact  the
        grandchildren have medical needs,  as  evidenced  by  the  material
        available to the Judge, that the Appellants  play  a  role  helping
        their daughter to enable her to attend appointments and to make  it
        easier for her to meet the needs of her family unit.


    18. Mr Malik was asked about  the  consequences  of  removal  for  this
        family. He submitted that if they return they will be  homeless  as
        the government had taken their flat and given it to the tenant  who
        is an occupation.   It was also submitted the First Appellant is in
        his mid-60s and would find it difficult to find work  meaning  that
        the family will be destitute. It was also submitted there  will  be
        "great concerns" regarding the impact upon  the  grandchildren  and
        their daughter and that when everything is considered in the  round
        there are exceptional circumstances resulting in harsh consequences
        if the Appellants are forced to leave the country.


    19. The reality of the changes to the Immigration Rules which came into
        force in July 2012 is that they now present a formidable hurdle for
        individuals unable to succeed under paragraph 276 ADE  or  Appendix
        FM.


    20. The fact the Appellants have  overstayed  for  ten  years  and  are
        unable  to  succeed  under  the  Rules  is  material  for  in  such
        circumstances it is necessary to consider whether the Secretary  of
        State's decision will result  in  compelling  circumstances  giving
        rise to unjustifiably harsh consequences for the Appellants' or any
        family member as stated above.


    21. The First Appellant has established his own business and brought  a
        property in the United Kingdom and both he  and  his  wife  have  a
        private life established;  which  includes  the  church  and  their
        family in this country.  As stated above,  they  were  fully  aware
        that their position is precarious.  Whilst I accept that  returning
        to Venezuela after such a period of time in the United Kingdom will
        cause some degree of hardship and need to readjust it  is  accepted
        that the Appellants have another son who has remained in  Venezuela
        and it has not been shown that he will be unable to assist them  in
        making necessary practical arrangements.  They may have lost  their
        flat but it has not been shown that they will be unable  to  secure
        appropriate accommodation.  They have  a  property  in  the  United
        Kingdom, in Mitcham in Surrey, which has equity in  the  region  of
        �35,000 and it has not been shown that it  could  not  be  sold  or
        rented out to produce an income.  If sold it  has  not  been  shown
        that from  the  proceeds  the  Appellants  would  not  be  able  to
        accommodate or maintain themselves  until  they  are  able  to  re-
        establish their lives in Venezuela.


    22. The First Appellant is a qualified electrician who has  established
        a business in the United Kingdom.  It has not been  shown  that  he
        will be unable to re-establish a business or obtain  employment  in
        that country from which he can support himself and his wife.


    23. The Appellants son has no  right  to  be  educated  in  the  United
        Kingdom and it was accepted that he is likely to  return  with  his
        parents to Venezuela. This has not been shown to be unreasonable in
        all the circumstances as it has  not  been  shown  that  he  cannot
        attend university in the country of which he  is  a  national.   No
        sufficiently adverse impact on the future  welfare  or  educational
        prospects of this young man has been established.


    24. The private life the Appellants enjoy with their daughter  will  be
        materially changed and become reliant upon indirect contact  and  I
        accept that there will be  some  distress  if  the  Appellants  are
        returned  to  Venezuelan  with  their  daughter  and  grandchildren
        remaining in the United Kingdom.  It has not been  shown,  however,
        that the impact of removing the Appellants will be  such  that  the
        degree of any physical or emotional harm that may  result  will  be
        sufficient to cross the necessary threshold.  It appears to be  one
        of emotional distress, confusion, and the  need  for  a  period  of
        adjustment but it is not been shown that the family who  remain  in
        the United Kingdom will not be able to readjust and re-establish  a
        routine. It is not been  shown  that  the  best  interests  of  the
        grandchildren require  the  Appellants  to  remain  in  the  United
        Kingdom as it has not  been  shown  that  their  fundamental  needs
        cannot be met by their mother; with or without  the  assistance  of
        the statutory services.


    25. Having considered the appropriate legal provisions and the case  as
        advanced by both parties,  with  the  degree  of  anxious  scrutiny
        required in an appeal of this  nature,  I  find  that  the  Judge's
        approach to this case is infected by legal error  material  to  the
        decision to allow the appeal.  I set the  determination  aside.  In
        light of the material advanced and the correct application  of  the
        law  to  this  case  I  do  not  find  that  the  Appellants   have
        substantiated their claim to be entitled to a  grant  of  leave  to
        remain in the United Kingdom under Article 8 or on any other basis.


    26. It was submitted during the course of the hearing by the Appellants
        that in Venezuela life was difficult for  them  but  no  Article  3
        claim was advanced before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  if  they
        believe they have a valid asylum/protection claim the Secretary  of
        State has set out  procedures  for  making  such  a  claim  in  the
        Immigration Rules. It is not an issue before this Tribunal  in  any
        event.


Decision

    27. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. This appeal is dismissed.


   Anonymity.


    28. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005. I make no such order pursuant to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).


   Fee Award.


   Note: this is not part of the determination.


    29. In the light of my decision to re-make the decision in  the  appeal
        by dismissing it, I have considered whether to  make  a  fee  award
        (rule  23A  (costs)  of  the  Asylum   and   Immigration   Tribunal
        (Procedure) Rules 2005  and  section  12(4)(a)  of  the  Tribunals,
        Courts and Enforcement Act 2007).


          I have had regard to the Joint  Presidential  Guidance  Note:  Fee
   Awards in           Immigration Appeals (December 2011).


          I make no fee award.


          Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.
