Representation:

For the Appellant:     First Appellant in person
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Hussain in which he dismissed the appeal of the Appellants, citizens of
    India, against the Secretary of State's decision  to  refuse  leave  to
    remain and set removal directions.


 2. The First Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom in 2010 as a  Tier  1
    (post-study work) Migrant and the Second Appellant was and remains  his
    dependent. Leave to remain in this category expired on 28 July 2014 and
    on 22 July 2014 the First Appellant applied for further leave to remain
    as a Tier 4 (General) Student migrant. His application was  refused  by
    the  Respondent  on  4  November  2014  and  the   Second   Appellant's
    application as his dependent was  refused  on  26  November  2014.  The
    Appellants exercised their right of appeal against these decisions  and
    this is the appeal that was heard before Judge Hussain on 27 July  2015
    and dismissed. The appeal was heard on papers at  the  request  of  the
    Appellants' legal  representatives.  The  Appellants'  application  for
    permission to appeal against the First-tier Tribunal  Judge's  decision
    was  granted  on  12  February  2016  by  First-tier   Tribunal   Judge
    Hollingworth in the following terms

       This case was  decided  on  the  papers.  The  Judge  has  stated  at
       paragraph 10 of the decision that despite an exhausted  (sic)  search
       he was unable to locate the Appellant's grounds of appeal.


       It is arguable that the Appellants have been denied  a  fair  hearing
       given that the Judge was not in possession of the Grounds  of  Appeal
       when deciding the case.


       It is further arguable that the Judge  should  have  dealt  with  the
       question of whether there would be a breach of Article 8.






 3. By a rule 24 response dated 3 March 2016  the  Respondent  opposed  the
    appeal although the person preparing that response did not  have  sight
    of the case file.


 4. At the hearing before me Mr Richards  appeared  for  the  Secretary  of
    State and the First Appellant appeared in person. No skeleton arguments
    were submitted.


Submissions

 5. The First Appellant said that he came here in 2010 and had a post study
    work Visa until 2014. He was trying  to  get  a  work  permit.  He  met
    someone in London who said that he could offer him a  work  permit,  he
    found him on Gumtree. He took �3000 but he delayed,  he  said  that  he
    would get a sponsorship letter but nothing happened. As the post  study
    work visa expired on 28 July 2014 he said  he  would  issue  the  First
    Appellant with a CAS the time being. The First Appellant said  that  it
    was his fault, he did not take advice. The months went on. This man was
    a fraud. When he found out it was too late and he contacted the police.
    He got a reference number. He also got a refund of �1500. When  he  got
    the decision letter he understood, it was right. The Home  Office  took
    the right decision. The First Appellant said that he has had  a  child.
    The child is 19 months old. The First Appellant and his wife have  been
    away from India for six years. He said that he had come here to plead a
    favour. He and his wife both work. It will be difficult in his  country
    to find a job. He has debts too which he is not in a position to clear.
    The First Appellant is working for British Gas in a call centre and his
    wife is a care assistant. The First Appellant  asked  if  the  Tribunal
    could give him some time. His parents in India  are  elderly  and  they
    depend on him. He is their only son. The First Appellant asked  whether
    the Tribunal could do something for him. He promised that he would  not
    be a burden on the state.




 6. For the Respondent Mr Richards said that the Judge made his decision on
    the evidence before him. It was difficult to see how he could have come
    to a different decision.




 7. I said that it was inevitable that  the  Appellants'  appeal  would  be
    dismissed and I returned reserved my written decision.




    Error of law

 8. The Appellants are citizens of India who came  to  the  United  Kingdom
    lawfully in 2010. They have remained in this  country  lawfully  and  I
    have no reason to believe that the Appellants are anything  other  than
    honest and law-abiding people. The First Appellant  obtained  leave  to
    enter and remain as  a  post-study  work  migrant.  He  quite  candidly
    explains to me that it was his wish and intent to obtain a work  permit
    when his permission to stay expired. He sought the help of a person who
    took money from him but who did not get the work permit. An application
    was instead made for leave to remain as a student. It is a  requirement
    for such an application to succeed for the applicant to  have  a  valid
    confirmation of acceptance for studies (CAS).  The  Appellant  did  not
    have one and accordingly the application  was  refused.  The  Appellant
    accepts that the decision to refuse was  correct.  Undoubtedly  it  was
    correct. The application did not meet the requirements of the rules.




 9. The Appellant took legal advice and Notice of Appeal was lodged against
    the decision. The Appellants' legal representatives, Legend  Solicitors
    drafted grounds of appeal which do not  help  greatly.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge did not have those grounds before him but in the context
    of the circumstances prevailing there is nothing to  suggest  it  would
    have made any difference to his decision. The grounds of appeal firstly
    complain that the Second Appellant's refusal letter has  been  received
    but not that of the First Appellant. The substance of the grounds reads
    as follows


       "appellants contend that the decision is not in accordance  with  the
       immigration rules, decision is not otherwise in accordance  with  the
       common law duty of fairness and also the decision is unlawful because
       it is incompatible with the  appellant's  right  under  the  European
       Convention on human rights"




10. It is common ground that  the  decision  was  in  accordance  with  the
    Immigration Rules. So far  as  the  common  law  duty  of  fairness  is
    concerned there is no specification of the way in which it  is  alleged
    that such duty has been breached. It is clear from the  evidence  given
    by the First Appellant that any unfairness that there may have been was
    perpetrated by the person employed to  help  him  rather  than  by  the
    Respondent.




11. The way in which it is alleged that the decision is  incompatible  with
    the Appellants' rights under the European Convention on Human Rights is
    equally non-specific. The Judge did not separately deal with the  Human
    Rights Convention at the First-tier Tribunal  hearing.  To  the  extent
    that he may have erred by failing to do so there was in my judgement no
    material error of law. There was no  detail  whatsoever  given  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal as to how the  Appellants'  rights  may  have  been
    breached. Without such detail it  was  impossible  for  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge to find compelling reasons, or indeed  any  reasons,  to
    consider  the  Appellants'  circumstances  outside  the  terms  of  the
    Immigration Rules. Further and in any event it is clear that this is  a
    family who have spent some six years in the United Kingdom with limited
    leave to remain and will be able to return to India as  a  family  with
    their infant child. There can be no arguable  case  that  their  rights
    under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human  Rights  or  indeed
    any other article has been breached.




12. There is in my judgment  no  error  of  law  material  to  the  Judge's
    decision to dismiss this appeal.






Conclusion

13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error of law for the reasons set out above.


14. This appeal is dismissed.  The  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    stands.
