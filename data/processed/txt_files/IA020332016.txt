Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr M. Iqbal, Counsel
For the respondent:    Mr N. Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant appealed  against  the  respondent's  decision  date  19
    April 2016 to refuse to grant  leave  to  remain  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student Migrant. The application was made on the 07 March 2014. This is
    an 'old style' appeal to be  decided  under  the  provisions  in  force
    before the changes made to Part V of the Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 ("NIAA 2002") by the Immigration Act 2014 ("IA 2014").

2.    The respondent refused the application with reference to  the  General
    Grounds for Refusal contained in  paragraph  322(1A)  (false  documents
    submitted with the application) of the immigration rules. The applicant
    submitted a TOEIC English language certificate  issued  by  Educational
    Testing Services (ETS) in support of the application.  The  certificate
    was obtained from Universal Training Centre on 22 January 2014. ETS had
    declared the certificate to be 'invalid' because there was "significant
    evidence to conclude that your certificate was fraudulently obtained by
    the use of a proxy test taker".

3.    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Trevaskis  ("the  judge")  dismissed  the
    appeal in a decision  promulgated  on  22  September  2017.  The  judge
    considered the evidence put forward by the respondent, which included a
    'look-up tool' print out relating to the particular test certificate, a
    'look-up tool' print out for Universal Training Centre for  22  January
    2014, the 'generic' statements of Rebecca Collings and Peter Millington
    and a Project Fa�ade report of  the  criminal  inquiry  into  fraud  at
    Universal Training Centre.

4.    The judge went on to  consider  the  appellant's  oral  evidence.  The
    appellant explained that he lived in Southall, but had taken  the  test
    in Watford because he didn't have much time to take the test and it was
    the nearest place. He denied that he went there because he  heard  that
    people were able to cheat at that centre. He told the judge that  there
    were 15-20 people taking the test that day. His photograph  was  taken.
    He didn't see anyone cheating. The appellant relied on the fact that he
    had taken an English language test in 2011 and had no  need  to  use  a
    proxy. The judge noted the submissions made by both representatives and
    outlined relevant case law. The judge began his findings  at  paragraph
    22 as follows:

         "22.     The approach to this decision is to begin  by  considering
         whether the respondent has met the burden  of  proof  upon  her  to
         raise a reasonable suspicion that the test results were obtained by
         deception. I have  considered  the  evidence  relied  upon  by  the
         respondent in that context; notwithstanding the absence of analysis
         of the voice recording, I am  satisfied  that  the  respondent  has
         produced sufficient evidence to discharge her burden  of  proof  of
         deception, so as to give rise to a burden of proof on the appellant
         to provide an innocent explanation. In doing so I am following  the
         authority quoted above."

5.    The judge had the benefit of hearing evidence from the  appellant  and
    noted that he was able to "understand and express  himself  effectively
    in English". He reminded himself that there might be many  reasons  why
    someone might cheat in a test regardless of their standard of  English.
    He noted the appellant's explanation as to why he chose that particular
    test centre. The judge took into account the passage of time since  the
    appellant took the test, but noted that the appellant's recollection of
    how many people took the test that day was markedly different from  the
    ETS 'look-up tool' print out, which only showed  that  two  tests  were
    taken at Universal Training Centre on 22 January 2014. The  judge  went
    on to consider  the  evidence  in  the  Project  Fa�ade  report,  which
    contained the "remarkable statistic" that 75% of the test results  over
    a period of 23 months were deemed 'invalid'. The appellant's  test  was
    amongst them. The judge went on to state:

         "28.     The appellant has taken and passed a further test in 2011.
         While that shows that he may not have needed to cheat in the  tests
         in 2014, it is not conclusive evidence that he did not do so."

6.    After having considered the evidence as a whole  the  judge  concluded
    that the test  certificate  was  obtained  fraudulently  and  that  the
    General Grounds for Refusal applied.

7.    The appellant appealed against the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  on
    the following grounds:

          i) The First-tier Tribunal erred in failing to consider  why  the
             appellant would cheat when he passed a similar  test  in  2011
             successfully and erred in finding that it was not  "conclusive
             evidence" that he did not cheat in the 2014 test (grounds 1  &
             3 make largely the same point).

         ii) The First-tier Tribunal failed to make clear findings  on  the
             credibility of the appellant's oral evidence.

        iii) The First-tier Tribunal erred in referring  to  evidence  from
             Project Fa�ade when it was not included  in  the  respondent's
             bundle. This ground was  abandoned  at  the  hearing.  It  was
             accepted that there was  a  supplementary  bundle  before  the
             First-tier Tribunal.

Decision and reasons

8.    I find that none of the points  raised  on  behalf  of  the  appellant
    demonstrate that the First-tier Tribunal decision involved  the  making
    of an error of law that would have made any material difference to  the
    outcome of the appeal.

9.    Although the judge's reference to "conclusive  evidence"  in  relation
    to the test taken in 2011 was inaccurate, elsewhere in the decision the
    judge clearly had in mind the correct burden and standard of proof.  He
    directed himself to relevant decisions in R (Gazi) v SSHD  [2015]  UKUT
    00327, SM & Qadir v SSHD [2016] UKUT 00229, SSHD v Shehzad [2016]  EWCA
    Civ 615 and MA (ETS-TOEIC) [2016] UKUT 00450.  He  began  his  findings
    with a legally accurate summary of the task ahead of him [22].

10.   I agree  that  the  judge  could  have  made  more  detailed  findings
    relating to the credibility of the appellant as a witness.  However,  I
    have considered whether what he said was sufficient in the  context  of
    the evidence before him. The appellant's witness statement  provided  a
    limited response to the allegation  of  fraud.  The  only  reasons  put
    forward in response were that (i)  his  photograph  was  on  the  TOEIC
    certificate (implying that he attended the test centre);  and  (ii)  he
    passed an earlier English language test successfully in 2011. Mr  Iqbal
    accepted that the first point did  not  take  the  matter  any  further
    because a photograph is included on any TOEIC certificate whether it is
    genuine or false.

11.   The judge summarised the  evidence  given  by  the  appellant  at  the
    hearing. He made his own observations about the appellant's ability  to
    express himself at the hearing [23]. However, it was  open  to  him  to
    take into account that there could be many reasons  why  someone  might
    cheat rather than taking  the  test  themselves  "regardless  of  their
    ability". This approach was consistent with what was said in  MA  (ETS-
    TOEIC testing) at [57]:

         "57.     Second, we acknowledge the suggestion that  the  Appellant
         had no reason to engage  in  the  deception  which  we  have  found
         proven. However, this has not deflected us in any way from reaching
         our main findings and conclusions.  In  the  abstract,  of  course,
         there is a range of reasons why persons proficient in  English  may
         engage in TOEIC  fraud.  These  include,  inexhaustively,  lack  of
         confidence, fear of  failure,  lack  of  time  and  commitment  and
         contempt  for  the  immigration   system.   These   reasons   could
         conceivably overlap in individual cases  and  there  is  scope  for
         other explanations for deceitful conduct in this sphere. We are not
         required to make the further finding of why the  Appellant  engaged
         in deception and to this we add that this issue  was  not  explored
         during the hearing. We resist any  temptation  to  speculate  about
         this discrete matter.

12.   The judge's subsequent observation at [24]  clearly  followed  on  and
    formed part of his finding at [23] although it was not stated in terms.
    He noted  that  the  appellant's  explanation  for  choosing  Universal
    Training Centre was that he was "under time pressure to obtain the test
    certificate". I find that it is reasonable to infer that the judge took
    this into account as a possible alternative explanation as to  why  the
    appellant might cheat despite his English language ability. It was open
    to the judge to take this information into account.

13.   The judge set out the discrepancy in the appellant's  evidence  as  to
    how many people took the test on 22 January 2014. The judge  considered
    whether the passage of time since the  test  might  have  impaired  the
    appellant's memory. I agree that the judge  could  have  explained  the
    point in more detail, however, the discrepancy between the  appellant's
    evidence that around 15-20 people took the test and  the  ETS  'look-up
    tool' evidence showing that only two tests were taken that day  was  so
    stark that I find little  reasoning  was  in  fact  necessary.  If  the
    numbers  had  been  closer  I  might  have  considered   that   further
    explanation was required, but the discrepancy was  clear  and  was  not
    adequately explained by the passage of time.

14.   It is accepted that there was a supplementary bundle before the  judge
    containing further information specific to Universal  Training  Centre.
    It was open to the judge to take into account the  damning  information
    in the Project Fa�ade report, which stated that  75%  of  test  results
    over a period of 23 months (including the date the appellant  took  the
    test) were deemed invalid. Although  the  judge  did  not  outline  the
    evidence in the decision, the report went further. It also stated  that
    Universal Training Centre was one of the centres highlighted in the BBC
    Panorama programme that first uncovered widespread  fraud.  The  report
    stated that the college owners, directors and agents have been  charged
    with conspiring to facilitate a breach of immigration law  although  at
    the date of the report, the outcome of the trial  was  not  yet  known.
    During the Project Fa�ade investigation, it  was  said  that  documents
    were discovered at Universal Training  Centre,  which  related  to  the
    tests taken at the college listing the candidate name alongside that of
    the 'pilot' used, the fee  paid,  the  agent  details  and  the  "score
    required". In addition to this evidence the ETS 'look-up tool' relating
    to the tests taken at Universal Training Centre on  the  day  that  the
    appellant took the test showed that only two tests were taken and  both
    were deemed 'invalid'.

15.   The combination  of  the  generic  evidence  of  widespread  fraud  at
    several test centres, as well as specific information relating  to  the
    level of fraud at Universal Training Centre, in  combination  with  the
    ETS 'look-up tool' confirming  that  ETS  had  deemed  the  certificate
    'invalid' due to  evidence  of  a  proxy  test  taker,  was  compelling
    evidence to support the respondent's allegation.

16.   In offering an 'innocent explanation' to the  evidence  the  appellant
    could only say that he spoke English well enough  to  pass  a  previous
    test and therefore  had  no  motive  to  cheat.  The  judge  took  this
    explanation into account and rightly noted that there  might  be  other
    reasons why a person might cheat. In  this  case,  he  noted  that  the
    appellant was "under time pressure" to obtain a  test  certificate.  It
    was open to the judge to take into account a major discrepancy  in  the
    appellant's evidence, which could not be explained  adequately  by  the
    vagaries of memory over the passage of time.  Although  I  accept  that
    more detailed reasons might have been given, what the  judge  said  was
    sufficient  given  the  limited  evidence  the  appellant  produced  in
    response to the allegation. It is  understandable  that  the  appellant
    disagrees with the decision but it is not  arguable  that  the  judge's
    findings were outside a range of reasonable responses to the  evidence.
    It was open to the judge to conclude that the respondent's evidence was
    sufficiently compelling to show that the appellant relied upon a  false
    document in support of the application and that the General Grounds for
    Refusal applied.
