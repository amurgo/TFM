For the Appellant:     Mr K Smyth, Solicitor, Kesar & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Miss E Savage, Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Both parties appeal from the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge
    Oliver sitting at Hatton Cross on 28 April 2015) whereby  he  dismissed
    the appellant's appeal on asylum and humanitarian  protection  grounds,
    but allowed his appeal under Article 3 ECHR on the ground that  he  was
    at risk of serious ill-treatment if returned to Kabul.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal made an anonymity direction in favour of the appellant, and  I
    consider it is appropriate that the appellant continues to be  accorded
    anonymity for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The background to this case is that the appellant is an Afghan national
    with an assessed date of birth of 1 August 1996.  He claimed asylum  in
    the UK on 12 September 2012.  His claim was refused on  22  April  2013
    but he was granted discretionary leave to remain as  a  minor  until  1
    February 2014.  The appellant pursued an upgrade appeal,  arguing  that
    he should have been recognised as a refugee. This ground of appeal  was
    dismissed, but his appeal was allowed to the limited  extent  that  the
    decision was not in accordance with the law as the Home Office had  not
    made any effort to trace the appellant's family.

The Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim was that he  originated  from  Baghlan  Province.
    His mother remained in Afghanistan with his 3 year  old  sister  and  2
    year old brother.  He had not been able to establish contact with  them
    since leaving  Afghanistan  one  year  ago.   His  reason  for  fleeing
    Afghanistan was that his father was a policeman, who had been  murdered
    by the Taliban.  This had happened last year (2011).  A few days  after
    his father's funeral, a group of men came to the  family  home  looking
    for him.  His mother told him to run to the bazaar,  and  she  came  to
    find him a few hours later.  She said they were the Taliban and as  she
    could not protect him from them, she had  decided  that  he  should  go
    abroad.  His mother took him to Kabul, leaving his younger brother  and
    sister at home alone.  In Kabul she arranged for an agent to  take  him
    to the UK, and he travelled via Pakistan, Iran and Turkey.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal in September 2013

 4. In his decision dated 5 September 2013, Judge Vaudin  d'Imï¿½court  found
    that the appellant suffered from a congenital hearing defect which made
    him  very  vulnerable  and  as  having  probably  caused  him  to  have
    educational problems.  The evidence showed that he was a young man with
    complex  speech,  language  and  communication  difficulties.   He  was
    currently with a foster family and  it  was  clear  that  although  his
    social communication skills were very well developed and he was able to
    interact appropriately with his peers and teachers, he was  nonetheless
    to a great extent dependent on others for  his  wellbeing  and  general
    welfare.  He would not be able to lead a totally  independent  life  at
    the moment.  For example, he was incapable of caring for himself by way
    of cooking and making decisions with regards  to  his  wellbeing.   His
    self help skills were very limited.  Cooking was the most obvious  area
    where the appellant needed extra support.

 5. When the appeal first came before him on 5 June 2013, he had raised  as
    a clear issue his serious concern with regards to the  lack  of  effort
    made by his solicitors to substantiate his account of his father  being
    in the police and being killed in consequence.  When the  case  resumed
    before him on 4 September, no effort had been made at  all  to  "trace"
    the appellant's account of his father having been in the  police  force
    and being killed by the Taliban.  The judge was  satisfied  to  a  very
    high degree of probability that there would have been a record kept  of
    deaths of police officers serving in the Baghlan area, particularly  if
    it had occurred in the circumstances alleged by the appellant.  When Mr
    Smyth was quizzed about the matter, he  accepted  that,  in  accordance
    with his client's instructions, no tracing  effort  had  been  made  to
    verify the appellant's account.

 6. Although he suffered from a degree of vulnerability,  the  judge  found
    him to be sufficiently mature enough to be able to adhere to an account
    that his father was in the police force and killed by  the  Taliban  as
    the basis of his claim.  He was also just as  capable  of  having  made
    that up, if prompted to do so.  The appellant was  certainly  perceived
    by  his  family  to  be  sufficiently  mature  to  make  his  way  from
    Afghanistan to Europe, a journey which they must have been aware  would
    take a considerable period of time.  Despite  his  vulnerabilities,  he
    was able to do that successfully.

 7. The judge was entirely satisfied that the appellant  still  had  family
    living in the Baghlan area, which included his mother, his brother  and
    sister and more likely his father, and if not, his stepfather.  He  was
    also  satisfied  that  the  appellant  had  at  least  one  grandparent
    presently living in Kabul.

 8. It was entirely possible that the appellant had not  had  communication
    with his family since his arrival in the United Kingdom.  Nevertheless,
    this did not mean that the appellant had no family or  relative  abroad
    to whom he could turn to for  support.   His  solicitors  had  made  no
    effort to trace his family in Kabul or his family in the Baghlan  area.
    They were perfectly able to do so but it would appear  that  they  have
    been instructed not to do so.  At paragraph [66] the  judge  held  that
    the appellant was a minor and a vulnerable individual who would not  be
    able to survive in Afghanistan on his own and that he would not be able
    to relocate on his own in Afghanistan:

         "Nevertheless, on the evidence that I have heard in this case I was
         also entirely satisfied the appellant has family  support  both  in
         Kabul and in his home area."

 9. The judge reiterated this finding at paragraph  [69].   He  added  that
    these people could be contacted on his behalf by his solicitors and  by
    the  respondent  at  his  request  if  he  gave  them   the   necessary
    information.

10. At paragraph [74] he found that the Secretary of State  had  failed  in
    her tracing duty, but he also wished to underline  the  fact  that  the
    appellant and his solicitors had failed  to  assist  the  Secretary  of
    State in carrying out that duty.  He was satisfied  the  appellant  was
    aware that his family remained in Afghanistan and that he had given the
    correct address for his family, but no effort had been made by them  to
    trace the family.  The solicitors acting on  behalf  of  the  appellant
    were quite capable of writing to  the  family  and  seeking  out  their
    assistance in this case but had failed to do so as well.  It seemed  to
    him that this was on the appellant's instructions.

The Decision of the Upper Tribunal in December 2013

11. The appellant appealed  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  ("UT")  against  this
    decision, and his appeal came before a panel of three UT judges sitting
    at the Royal Courts of Justice on  12  November  2013.  The  panel  was
    chaired by Lord Matthews.

12. In a determination running to fifteen  pages,  the  UT  gave  extensive
    reasons for dismissing the appellant's appeal against the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal.

13. The ground of appeal which is of relevance to the  current  appeal  was
    the appellant's asserted status as "an  unattended  child".   Counsel's
    contention on behalf of the appellant was that, since  he  was  not  in
    contact with his family at the date of the hearing, and since he  would
    be at risk as a vulnerable minor on his own in  Afghanistan,  the  only
    conclusion open to the judge was that the appellant had  made  out  his
    entitlement to international protection.

14. Mr Deller, who appeared on behalf of the Secretary of  State,  rejected
    the proposition that the appellant was to be treated as  an  unattended
    child merely because he  had  not  in  fact  maintained  contact.   The
    finding that there were family members in Kabul  and  Baghlan  defeated
    any suggestion that he had a well-founded fear of persecution on return
    to Afghanistan as an unattended child.

15. The UT agreed with Mr Deller.  They  held  that  there  was  really  no
    evidence that the family were uncontactable.  While it was not for  the
    respondent to shuffle off her responsibilities to endeavour to trace  a
    family by referring the child to the Red Cross, nonetheless it was  for
    the appellant to make out his case.  He had not made out  a  case  that
    his family were not contactable.  On the contrary,  he  obviously  felt
    able to instruct a friend to make contact with  them.   (The  appellant
    had a friend who went back to Afghanistan on a visit. The appellant had
    asked this friend to bring back photographs of his family.  The  First-
    tier Tribunal judge found that the appellant must have told this friend
    where and how to contact his family.)

16. At paragraph [54] the UT acknowledged that this only dealt with part of
    the problem.  It might be said of  the  decision  that  they  had  just
    reached  that  they  too  were  looking  to  the  future.   They   were
    predicating the lack of risk on the basis of  contact  which  would  be
    made in the future, which was  precisely  what  was  complained  of  in
    relation to the determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   However,
    they were not satisfied that the fact that administrative  arrangements
    had to be made meant that the tempus inspiciendum of  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal fell to be regarded as in the future.

17. They cited paragraph [53] of HK and Others Afghanistan CG  [2010]  UKUT
    378 as follows:

         "It was pointed out in the respective refusal letters that once  an
         application for  return  assistance  has  been  approved,  the  IOM
         sending mission  makes  travel  arrangements  and  IOM  Afghanistan
         provides reception assistance through  the  co-ordination  cell  at
         Kabul  Airport.   Their  personnel  guide   beneficiaries   through
         immigration and  customs  processes.   Temporary  accommodation  is
         provided  upon   request   and   returnees   are   offered   onward
         transportation and assistance to their final  destination.   It  is
         therefore our conclusion that  assistance  would  be  available  to
         these  appellants,  both  in  seeking  out   their   relatives   in
         Afghanistan, and in facilitating their reunion and the reception of
         the appellants upon return to Kabul.  As noted above,  we  have  no
         reason to believe that contact with their families will be  impeded
         by the situation in Afghanistan, and have no reason to believe that
         the families have moved from where they were previously living."

18. They also cited paragraph [54] of HK, where the UT said:

         "The families are all able to make arrangements  for  the  boys  to
         travel out of Afghanistan to the west.   They  travelled  with  the
         assistance of agents and each of the families was clearly  able  to
         provide the finance for such journeys, which is no small amount  of
         money.  We have no reason to believe that their families could  not
         travel to Kabul to meet them on their return."

19. The panel also referred to ST (Child asylum seekers) Sri  Lanka  [2013]
    UKUT 292 (IAC) where the UT made the following  comments  at  paragraph
    73(d):

         "If the Home Office were,  hypothetically,  to  return  to  Colombo
         Airport at the present time, it would be doing  so  under  a  legal
         regime of UK law that imposed a duty to safeguard him  and  protect
         him whilst he was under their  jurisdiction.   At  the  least  this
         would require the provision of a suitable escort for the  appellant
         on his journey to Colombo.  It would also require suitable  liaison
         with the High Commission, any willing family members, international
         organisations or local social services on his  arrival.   He  would
         not just be dumped at the airport or the nearest beach."

20. The conclusion which the UT drew from the cited passages in HK  and  ST
    was that while the risk had to be  assessed  as  at  the  date  of  the
    hearing,  nonetheless  in  each  case  it  was  also  recognised   that
    administrative arrangements would have to be put in place in the future
    to facilitate the return of the individual  concerned.   That  did  not
    mean that the decision on the merits was flawed.

The reasons for refusing the appellant further leave

21. On 30 January 2014 the appellant applied for further leave to remain in
    the United Kingdom, and on 9 December 2014 the Secretary of State  gave
    her reasons for refusing to grant him further leave to remain.

22. On the issue of risk on return, his solicitors said that he was not  in
    contact with his family.  This did not equate to it being impossible to
    trace his family.  In the determination promulgated on 9 December 2013,
    the Upper Tribunal had cited with approval the passage in HK which said
    that where a child has close relatives in Afghanistan who would  assist
    him in leaving the country, any assertion that such family members  are
    not contactable or unable to meet the child in Kabul and care  for  him
    on return should be  supported  by  credible  evidence  of  efforts  to
    contact those family members and their inability to meet and  care  for
    the child in the event of return.

23. His  representatives  had  failed  to  provide  such  evidence  in  his
    application. So he had yet to  explore  all  avenues  open  to  him  to
    establish contact with his family in Afghanistan.  Regarding  the  UK's
    obligations to conduct family tracing, it  had  not  been  possible  to
    locate his family on the information he had supplied.

24. On 19 May  2014,  a  representative  of  the  Secretary  of  State  had
    contacted the appellant and informed him of the family tracing services
    available to assist  family  members  who  had  become  separated.   In
    addition, on 17 June 2014 the representative on behalf of the Secretary
    of State had contacted his solicitors to advise them that they  or  his
    guardian "must" start the process to contact his family.   But  he  had
    provided no evidence to show that he had  approached  the  British  Red
    Cross or International Social Services  in  an  attempt  to  trace  his
    family.  So he had not demonstrated he had made any credible efforts to
    contact his family, and that these efforts had failed.

25. The respondent made reference to EU (Afghanistan)  and  Others  v  SSHD
    [2013] EWCA Civ 32 and to AK (Article 15(c)) Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT
    163.  It was not believed he had any reason to remain in the  UK  as  a
    refugee. He had fabricated his story in order to gain leave  to  remain
    and he was more than capable of sustaining himself in Afghanistan.   He
    was a healthy, well educated male who had demonstrated  resourcefulness
    by leaving Afghanistan and remaining in the UK for around  three  years
    and three months.  He was now an adult and would not  be  returning  to
    Afghanistan as an unattended child.  Therefore the findings in  HK,  LQ
    and  AA  were  no  longer  considered   applicable   to   his   current
    circumstances.  The issue of  locating  his  family  members  was  thus
    purely academic.

The Hearing before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

26. Both parties were legally  represented  at  the  hearing  before  Judge
    Oliver.  The appellant was present at the  hearing,  and  followed  the
    proceedings with the assistance of a court  interpreter.   He  was  not
    however called to give evidence.   The  hearing  proceeded  by  way  of
    submissions only.  Mr Smyth stated that Devaseelan applied, but the key
    unresolved issue was the method  of  return.   He  submitted  that  the
    practicalities of removal had not previously been relevant.  He  relied
    heavily on the decision in JI v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 279 to  argue  the
    courts could not delegate to the respondent the  ultimate  question  of
    whether return would be safe.  The date of return  was  subject  to  an
    assessment of the risk involved.  The  appellant  was  being  asked  to
    travel alone for three and a half hours to his village.  The  risk  had
    to be decided at the date of the hearing.   The  crucial  question  was
    whether he could be met at the airport and then safely escorted to  his
    family members.

27. The Presenting Officer relied on the refusal letters and emphasised the
    findings of fact  in  the  previous  appeal  which  were  preserved  by
    Devaseelan.  He submitted that it was difficult to know where the truth
    stopped and the fabrication started.

28. The judge's findings are very brief,  and  I  reproduce  them  verbatim
    below:

         "35. I am bound by the previous findings of fact.   In  respect  of
             the asylum claim I find that the  limited  basis  on  which  I
             could approach the facts to apply my own independent  judgment
             is not open to me.  I accordingly find  that  the  appellant's
             asylum claim fails, and together with it his article  3  claim
             insofar as it relates to his claim to fear ill-treatment  from
             the Taliban on return.  I note too that  he  has  only  lately
             shown any enthusiasm for tracing his family.   While  this  is
             relevant  to  a  finding  whether  he  has  family  still   in
             Afghanistan it cannot be relevant to the  separate  article  3
             question as to  the  safety  of  his  return  to  Kabul.   The
             reasoning in JI is compelling and even more pertinent to  this
             case because this is a case  where  no  assurances  have  been
             given by the respondent.  The evidence on the ground  is  very
             recent and is reflected in the Foreign Office's current advice
             to travellers, warning against all  but  essential  travel  to
             Kabul  and  most  of  Baghlan.   I  have  taken  account   the
             depressing uncertainty in the current  proposed  arrangements,
             as reflected in the email correspondence which  Mr  Smyth  has
             helpfully conducted with the humanitarian boots on the ground.
              I note too that the appellant appears to fall  into  both  of
             the categories of returnees to which the minister referred  in
             the quote I have cited above and is  accordingly  at  risk  of
             serious ill-treatment in breach of article 3."

The Appeal of the Secretary of State

29. The Secretary of State appealed  against  the  decision  to  allow  the
    appeal on Article 3 grounds, arguing that  the  judge  had  incorrectly
    looked at the fact that an injunction had been sought  on  removals  to
    Afghanistan as being determinative of the Article 3 claim,  instead  of
    applying the findings of extant country  guidance,  in  particular  the
    country guidance given in AK.  Reliance was placed on SG (Iraq)  [2012]
    EWCA Civ 940 where the Court of Appeal stated at  paragraph  [47]  that
    decision-makers and Tribunal  judges  were  required  to  take  country
    guidance determinations into account, and to follow  them  unless  very
    strong grounds supported by cogent  evidence  were  adduced  justifying
    their not doing so.

The Appellant's Cross-Appeal

30. The appellant's cross-appeal mirrored his Rule 24 response opposing the
    Secretary of State's appeal, but it also went further.

31. In the light of the  appellant's  particular  vulnerabilities  and  the
    absence of  family  support  to  receive  him  at  Kabul  International
    Airport, Judge Oliver had properly found that he would be at risk under
    Article 3 ECHR.  But in the light of that finding,  his  appeal  should
    also be allowed under the Refugee  Convention,  as  his  attainment  of
    majority did not mean that he fell outside the particular social  group
    recognised in LQ (Age:  immutable  characteristic)  Afghanistan  [2008]
    UKAIT 0005.  Although he was no longer a child, the appellant was  only
    aged 18 at the date of the hearing, and there was no bright line across
    which the risk to and the needs of a child suddenly disappear,  as  was
    held inter alia in K (Afghanistan) and Others v Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 1014.

Discussion

32. The issue in JI was whether  the  claimant's  proposed  deportation  to
    Ethiopia would engender a real risk that JI would suffer torture or ill-
    treatment at the hands of the Ethiopian authorities.   The  SIAC  judge
    had  found  that,  absent  assurances  given   in   a   memorandum   of
    understanding, there would be a  real  risk  that  the  claimant  would
    suffer torture or ill-treatment on return contrary to Article  3  ECHR.
    He also found the Ethiopian government could be trusted to comply  with
    those  assurances.   There  was  however  work  to  be  done  before  a
    monitoring body, referred to as the EHRC, would have  developed  proper
    capacity for monitoring.  The SIAC judge found that  the  Secretary  of
    State would not deport the appellant before  all  that  work  had  been
    done, and had undertaken to give removal directions  five  days  before
    the date of deportation.  That would allow the claimant sufficient time
    to commence judicial review  proceedings,  if  he  contended  that  the
    necessary work in relation to preparation for monitoring  had  not  yet
    been done.

33. The issue before the Court of Appeal was to what extent could the  SIAC
    leave issues to be resolved by the Secretary of State at a future date?
     Giving the leading judgment of the court, Jackson LJ at paragraph [49]
    held that an assurance or undertaking  which  the  Secretary  of  State
    gives is a relevant factor for the  court  or  Tribunal  to  take  into
    account.  But such an assurance or undertaking could not operate so  as
    to cut down the legal protection to which an individual was entitled.

34. This analysis was consistent with the reasoning of the Court of  Appeal
    in CL (Vietnam) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2008]
    EWCA Civ 1551.  In CL the claimant arrived in the United Kingdom as  an
    unaccompanied child and claimed asylum.  The Secretary of State refused
    his claim.  An Immigration Judge allowed the claimant's appeal  on  the
    basis that  there  were  not  adequate  reception  facilities  for  the
    claimant in his home state.  The Secretary of  State  appealed  to  the
    AIT, and gave an undertaking  he  would  not  return  the  claimant  to
    Vietnam,  unless  he  was  satisfied  the  reception  facilities   were
    adequate.  The AIT allowed the Secretary of  State's  appeal,  and  the
    claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal.  The Court of Appeal  allowed
    the claimant's appeal, as the effect of the procedure  being  advocated
    was to remove the child's statutory right of appeal on that  aspect  of
    the Article 8 claim, and to leave  the  child  with  the  more  limited
    remedy of judicial review.

35. However Jackson LJ went on to cite SH (Iraq) [2009] EWCA Civ 462  which
    had a different outcome.  This was an asylum claim concerning an  Iraqi
    Kurd who came from the northern region of Iraq.  One of  the  arguments
    raised in the Court of Appeal was that there was no practical and  safe
    route by which he could be returned to northern Iraq.   Keene  LJ,  who
    was the same judge who had been part of the  court  that  allowed  CL's
    appeal, rejected this argument for the following reasons:

         "No removal directions have yet been settled  for  the  appellant's
         return, and it is therefore unclear as to how and where he would be
         returned.   The  issue  of  accessibility,  its  safety   and   its
         practicality cannot therefore yet be judged in any meaningful sense
         (my emphasis).  Those issues will of course  change  over  time  as
         well as being dependent upon  the  method  and  location  to  which
         return is to be effected.  If, when those  removal  directions  are
         set, there would be a  real  risk  of  this  country  breaking  its
         obligations under the Refugee Convention or  the  ECHR  because  of
         those directions, they themselves  could  then  be  challenged  but
         there is nothing it seems to me in this particular point."

36. Jackson LJ said that SH differed from CL in that in SH  the  court  was
    not relying on any undertaking by the Secretary of  State.   The  court
    was instead leaving for later resolution by the Secretary of  State  an
    issue  which  the  appellant  had  raised  at  a  late  stage  in   the
    proceedings.

37. Jackson LJ went on to formulate a set of principles at  paragraph  [55]
    which included the following:

         "(v) If the route or method of return  is  unknown,  the  court  or
             Tribunal may in appropriate cases leave this matter for  later
             decision by the Secretary of State.  If the Secretary of State
             fails to address the matter properly, the claimant's remedy is
             by way of making a fresh claim  or  bringing  judicial  review
             proceedings.

         (vi) The  court  or  Tribunal  cannot,  however,  delegate  to  the
             Secretary of State the resolution of any material  element  of
             the legal claim which the claimant  has  brought  before  that
             court or Tribunal for determination."

38. In his decision,  Judge  Oliver  says  that  the  reasoning  in  JI  is
    compelling and even more pertinent to this case because this is a  case
    where  no  assurances  have  been  given  by  the   respondent.    This
    observation indicates to me that he has  not  properly  understood  the
    ratio of JI.

39. Removal directions had not  yet  been  set,  and  so  removal  was  not
    imminent. The appellant's removal was also  not  imminent  for  another
    reason. According to a  statement  made  by  the  Afghan  Ministry  for
    Refugees and Repatriation on 28 February 2015, which the judge referred
    to in his decision, the appellant was in a category of persons who  was
    not going to be allowed to  disembark.   So  for  the  time  being  the
    appellant's removal was a practical impossibility.

40.  I accept that the likely route of return was known, which was that the
    appellant would be  flown  to  Kabul.   However,  in  addition  to  the
    question of when the apparent embargo on returning persons such as  the
    appellant was going to be lifted, the major unknown was (and still  is)
    whether arrangements can be made for an adult family member to  receive
    him on his arrival at the airport.

41. Contrary to the submission which Mr Smyth apparently made to the First-
    tier Tribunal, JI does not establish a  universal  principle  that  the
    courts cannot delegate to  the  respondent  the  ultimate  question  of
    whether return will be safe.  JI is much more limited in its scope.  It
    does not "overturn" the findings of the UT in this appellant's  earlier
    appeal.  It does not show that the UT's decision was per incuriam.

42. The burden of proof continues to rest with the appellant to  show  that
    family members in Afghanistan are not contactable so as to be  able  to
    meet him at Kabul Airport.

43. Mr Smyth relies on the concession made by the respondent  in  paragraph
    [31] of the refusal letter as showing that the position has  moved  on.
    He submits it has moved on because the respondent accepted in paragraph
    [31] that she was unable to contact the appellant's family.   But  this
    concession was withdrawn in the same letter.  For  the  author  of  the
    letter went on to give an account  of  what  the  respondent  had  done
    pursuant to her duty to trace. It is apparent from  this  account  that
    the Home Office had, in accordance with its  invariable  practice,  not
    itself tried to  trace  the  appellant's  family,  but  had  sought  to
    encourage and facilitate tracing by the appellant and  his  solicitors.
    As the respondent correctly surmised, the appellant had  not  made  any
    effort to contact his  family  through  the  Red  Cross,  nor  had  his
    solicitors made any effort to contact his family, for instance  by  the
    method recommended by First-tier Tribunal Judge Vaudin d'Imï¿½court.

44. Accordingly, at the  date  of  the  hearing  before  Judge  Oliver  the
    position had not in  fact  changed.  It  remained  the  case  that  the
    appellant had family in Baghlan Province and in  Kabul,  as  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Vaudin d'Imï¿½court had found. There was  no  evidence  of
    the appellant being  in  contact  with  his  family,  but  equally  the
    appellant had not discharged the burden of proving that he  was  unable
    to make contact with family members in Baghlan Province or Kabul.

45. So Judge Oliver was  right,  applying  Devaseelan,  to  find  that  the
    appellant had still not  discharged  the  burden  of  proving  that  he
    qualified for recognition as of refugee upon LQ grounds.

46. It therefore follows that  the  appellant's  cross-appeal  fails.   The
    judge did not err in law in finding the appellant did not  qualify  for
    recognition as a refugee. It also follows that, insofar as the  Article
    3 finding was based on the appellant's  asserted  vulnerability  as  an
    unattended child (applying the "no bright line" principle), this was an
    error  of  law.   For  the  appellant  could  not   simultaneously   be
    invulnerable from an asylum perspective, while being vulnerable from an
    Article 3  ECHR  perspective.   The  burden  had  not  shifted  to  the
    Secretary of State to prove that  there  would  be  adequate  reception
    facilities, and adequate  onward  transportation  facilities,  for  the
    appellant in circumstances where (a) he had not shown that  his  family
    were not contactable; and (b) his removal was not imminent.

47. The other consideration which underlay the judge's finding on Article 3
    ECHR was his assumption that the statement by the Minister, the Foreign
    Office's  current  advice  to  travellers  and  the  obtaining  of   an
    injunction against the removal by charter flight to Kabul of a group of
    failed Afghan  asylum  seekers  combined  to  show  that  the  security
    situation in Afghanistan had deteriorated to a point where there was  a
    real risk of Article 3 harm on return for all failed asylum seekers, or
    at least for those who came from dangerous provinces.

48. But the evidence referred to by the judge did not in fact undermine the
    country guidance given in cases such as AK that internal relocation  to
    Kabul is safe and reasonable for a young adult male with no  particular
    risk profile (such as  having  a  vulnerability  akin  to  that  of  an
    unattended child).  The judge erred  in  law  in  treating  the  latest
    developments (the Ministerial Statement, the Foreign Office advice  and
    the obtaining of an injunction) as in effect  superseding  the  country
    guidance of AK.  Moreover, he did  not  give  any  reasons,  let  alone
    cogent reasons, for not following extant country guidance  or  for  his
    implicit finding that the appellant faced a real risk of Article 3 harm
    in Kabul and/or in his home area of Baghlan Province.  The  appellant's
    home area in Baghlan province, in common with most of Baghlan province,
    is not regarded by the  Foreign  Office  as  being  so  dangerous  that
    persons are advised not to travel there at all.

49. Mr Smyth did not seek to defend the judge's finding  on  Article  3  by
    reference to the Ministerial Statement, the Foreign  Office  advice  or
    the injunction.  He acknowledged that  the  judicial  review  claim  in
    which the injunction had been granted had  ultimately  failed  for  the
    reasons given by the President of the UT sitting with UT Judge Allen in
    R (on the application of Naziri and Others) v Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department (JR - scope - evidence) IJR [2015] UKUT 437  (IAC),
    a decision promulgated on 27 July 2015.

50. The UT ruled inter alia as follows at paragraph [96]:

         "The Tribunal is equipped  to  make  a  further,  ex  post  factor,
         assessment  of  the  impugned  decisions  having  regard   to   the
         postdecision  evidence  which  it  has  received.   This   includes
         evidence of the successful repatriation of Afghan nationals in  the
         United Kingdom and other countries to a  series  of  provinces  (my
         emphasis).  In this context we refer particularly to  the  evidence
         digested in [50] above, which we accept.  The  evidence  reinforces
         our conclusion that the impugned  decisions  of  the  Secretary  of
         State are unimpeachable on the grounds advanced by the applicants."

51. Accordingly, I find that  the  judge  erred  in  law  in  allowing  the
    appellant's appeal under Article 3 ECHR.

The Remaking of the Decision on the Human Rights Claim

52. In the light of (a) my reasons for finding an error of law, and (b)  Mr
    Smyth's stance on the Article 3 claim (only seeking to maintain  it  on
    the ground that the  appellant  should  be  treated  as  an  unattended
    child), I am satisfied that the decision under Article 3 ECHR should be
    remade in favour of the Secretary of State.

53. Although the appellant formerly raised an Article 8 claim, it does  not
    appear from the grounds of appeal that  the  appellant  relied  on  any
    additional facts beyond those relied on in support  of  his  claim  for
    international protection.  The appellant has also not cross-appealed on
    the basis that  his  human  rights  claim  should  be  allowed  in  the
    alternative under Article 8.  The appellant did not  give  evidence  in
    support of an Article 8 claim, and no viable  private  or  family  life
    claim is disclosed under the Rules.  While the appellant's private life
    rights are plainly engaged outside the  Rules,  the  decision  appealed
    against is in accordance  with  the  law  and  it  is  necessary  in  a
    democratic society.  Having regard to Section 117B of the 2002 Act, the
    decision appealed against is plainly proportionate.

Notice of Decision

54. The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed, and the appellant's  appeal
    is dismissed.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  dismissing  the
    appeal on asylum and humanitarian protection did not contain  an  error
    of law, and accordingly that part of the decision stands.  The decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the appeal on human rights  grounds
    contained an error of law, and accordingly the decision  is  set  aside
    and the following decision is substituted: the  appellant's  appeal  on
    human rights grounds is dismissed.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
