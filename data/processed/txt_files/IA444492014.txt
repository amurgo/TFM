                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. For ease of reference I shall refer to the parties as they were  before
    the First-tier Tribunal. Thus, the Secretary of State is once more  the
    Respondent and Mr Nisar is the Appellant.

 2. This is an appeal by the Respondent against the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Seelhoff (hereafter the judge), promulgated on  11  June
    2015, in which he allowed the Appellant's appeal under the  Immigration
    Rules.  The Appellant's appeal to the First-tier Tribunal had  in  turn
    been against the Respondent's decision of 15 October 2014, refusing  to
    vary leave to remain and to remove him from the United Kingdom  by  way
    of  directions  under  Section  47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum   and
    Nationality Act 2006.

 3.  The  Respondent's  original  decision  had  been  in  response  to  an
    application made on 3 July 2014 seeking indefinite leave to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom  on  the  basis  of  ten  years'  continuous  lawful
    residence.  The Respondent had not been satisfied as to the  continuous
    lawful residence and had refused the application on that  basis  alone.
    As far as the reasons for refusal letter is concerned nothing was  said
    about the  public  proviso  provision  in  paragraph  276B(ii)  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The Respondent's decision also dealt with Article 8
    and refused the application on this basis as well.

The hearing before the judge

 4. The Respondent was unrepresented at the hearing.

 5. The judge considered the evidence before him and found at paragraph  14
    that the Appellant had in fact acquired ten  years'  continuous  lawful
    residence in the United  Kingdom.   Paragraph  14  concludes  with  the
    following statement by the judge: "I therefore find that the  Appellant
    is entitled to indefinite leave to remain under the Immigration Rules".
     The appeal was allowed outright.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 6. The Respondent sought permission to appeal on the basis that the  judge
    should not have allowed the appeal outright but ought instead  to  have
    allowed it on the limited basis that the decision under appeal was  not
    otherwise in accordance with the law, given that the Respondent had yet
    to exercise her discretion under paragraph 276B(ii) of the  Immigration
    Rules.  Reference is made in the grounds to the Upper Tribunal decision
    in GK (long residence, immigration history) [2008] UKAIT  00011  (IAC).
    Permission to appeal was refused in the first instance  by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal but was granted by Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Taylor  on  10
    October 2015.

The hearing before me

 7. At the outset of the hearing Mr Abbas provided Ms Sreeraman and  myself
    with printouts  of  notes  from  the  Respondent's  GCID  system.   The
    relevant entry to which I was referred was generated on 7 October 2014,
    prior to the Respondent's decision.  At page 5 of the printout there is
    an indication that as of that date the Respondent had  no  concerns  in
    respect of the  considerations  under  paragraph  276B(ii).   Mr  Abbas
    confirmed that these notes were not before the judge.  In  addition  to
    the notes Mr Abbas provided me with  the  Respondent's  long  residence
    guidance (v12.0, valid from 17 October 2014).  Mr Abbas submitted  that
    in light of the GCID information the judge had not materially erred  in
    law by allowing the appeal outright.  This  was  because  although  the
    Respondent had not exercised her discretion in terms (i.e. nothing  had
    been said about this on the face of the reasons  for  refusal  letter),
    the GCID notes confirmed that discretion  had  been  considered  and  a
    conclusion reached in the Appellant's favour.  Although the  judge  was
    unaware of this, any error committed by  him  in  allowing  the  appeal
    outright was immaterial because discretion had  already  in  fact  been
    exercised by the Respondent prior to the decision under appeal.

 8. Ms Sreeraman accepted that the judge's finding in respect  of  the  ten
    years' continuous lawful residence had been open to him.   However  she
    submitted that the judge had not known about the existence of the  GCID
    notes when making his decision and  that  his  error  in  allowing  the
    appeal outright was indeed material.  She accepted that if the  judge's
    decision was to be set aside  I  could  re-make  the  decision  on  the
    evidence before me and could properly allow the appeal, but only to the
    limited extent that it should be sent back  to  the  Respondent  for  a
    lawful exercise of discretion under paragraph 276B(ii).

 9. In response Mr Abbas reiterated the immateriality of any error and also
    added that this matter had been going on now for some time  and  should
    not be prolonged further.

Decision on error of law

10. In my view there was a material error of law in the judge's decision.

11. He was of course perfectly entitled to conclude that the Appellant  had
    in fact acquired the necessary residence in the United Kingdom, and the
    Respondent has expressly accepted this (both in the grounds  of  appeal
    and before me).  However, it is clear that in light of  decisions  such
    as GK and Ukus (discretion: when reviewable) [2012] UKUT  00307  (IAC),
    the judge should then have allowed  the  appeal  only  to  the  limited
    extent the decision under appeal was not otherwise in  accordance  with
    the law and that the Appellant's application for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain remained outstanding before the Respondent awaiting a fresh  and
    lawful decision, with particular  reference  to  the  discretion  under
    paragraph 276B(ii).

12. The judge was wholly unaware  of  the  existence  of  the  GCID  notes.
    Nothing was said about the discretionary element of paragraph  276B(ii)
    at the hearing before him, and of course nothing had been said  in  the
    reasons for refusal letter. In addition, there had been  no  concession
    of  the  issue  by  a  Presenting   Officer   (the   Respondent   being
    unrepresented before the judge). In  short,  there  was  no  evidential
    basis upon which the  judge  could  have  concluded  (expressly  or  by
    implication) that the discretion had been exercised at all, or that any
    such exercise could only have resulted in a favourable outcome for  the
    Appellant. There is an error of law here.

13. Is it material? Yes.

14. I am not convinced that the  GCID  entry  constituted  an  exercise  of
    discretion by the Respondent  in  the  first  place.  There  is  simply
    nothing in the decision notified to the Appellant and against which his
    appeal is brought. In any event, although the GCID notes  would  appear
    to have been in the Appellant's favour as regards the  public  interest
    proviso under the paragraph 276B(ii), there was of  course  a  temporal
    gap between the entry on 7 October 2014 and  the  judge's  decision  in
    June 2015.  It was possible that new matters may have come to light  or
    that new circumstances may have come into existence  which  could  have
    affected the view of the Respondent and/or the judge.  Given  that  the
    discretion issue was not addressed at all by the judge and the temporal
    gap, I am not sufficiently confident that the  outcome  of  the  appeal
    would have been the same absent the error of law.

15. In light of the above I conclude that the decision must be set aside.

Re-making the decision

16. Both representatives were agreed that  I  could  re-make  the  decision
    based upon the evidence before me.  This I now proceed to do.

17. The judge's finding as to the length of continuous lawful residence has
    not been challenged and is preserved.  Therefore the Appellant  clearly
    meets the requirement of paragraph 276B(i) of the Immigration Rules.

18. In respect of paragraph 276B(ii), I am not satisfied that there has  in
    fact been an exercise of  discretion  insofar  as  the  decision  under
    appeal is concerned. The GCID entry is an indication of a  view  taken,
    but is not a confirmed outcome as regards the discretion. In any event,
    I look at the Appellant's case as of today and there  been  no  further
    consideration of the Appellant's case since October 2014.  Further,  Ms
    Sreeraman has not conceded the outcome of any discretionary exercise. I
    am not  satisfied  that  an  exercise  of  discretion  under  paragraph
    276B(ii) would, as of now, permit of only one answer.

19. In these circumstances I allow the appeal only to  the  limited  extent
    that the decision of the Respondent was  not  otherwise  in  accordance
    with the law.

20. I would add the following observations. The contents of the GCID  notes
    are relevant and on  the  face  of  it  they  certainly  appear  to  be
    favourable to the Appellant as of October  2014.   In  making  a  fresh
    decision the Respondent will need to have regard to the view of her own
    caseworker at that time.

21. When considering the exercise of discretion now one would hope  that  a
    speedy decision can be reached, as this matter has indeed been somewhat
    protracted  now.    It   may   be   advisable   for   the   Appellant's
    representatives to submit any updated information to the Respondent  in
    the near future and prior to any fresh decision being made.

Anonymity

22. No direction has been sought and none is required.



Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

I re-make the decision by allowing the appeal on the limited basis that  the
Secretary of State's decision was not otherwise in accordance with the  law.
Mr Nisar's application for indefinite leave to remain is outstanding  before
the Secretary of State, awaiting a lawful decision in  light  of  the  Upper
Tribunal's decision.

No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to  make  a  full  fee
award of �140.00. This is because the Respondent should  have  accepted  the
lawful residence on the evidence before  her.  Further,  there  should  also
have been an exercise of discretion (one way of the other) in  the  original
refusal notice.
