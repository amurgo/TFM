                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Place,  promulgated  on  29th  March  2019,  following  a  hearing   at
    Nottingham on  22nd  March  2019.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the   Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Iraq, was born on 1st January  1979,  and
    is a female.  She appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated
    9th August 2019, refusing to grant her leave to remain in the UK on the
    basis of her private and family life as a spouse  of  her  husband,  Mr
    [KH], who has British citizenship, and is presently settled in the  UK.



The Appellant's Claim

 3. The essence of the Appellant's claim was set out by the  judge  in  the
    determination.  Mr [H], the Appellant's husband, is a British  citizen.
    He and the Appellant married  in  Iraq  in  2012.   She  was  initially
    refused entry clearance as a spouse.  Eventually she entered the UK  on
    a spouse's visa in January 2014  in  a  lawful  manner.   She  and  her
    husband have been trying for a child.  They  have  undergone  fertility
    treatment in the UK.  They had one round of treatment on  the  NHS  and
    are in the midst of  private  treatment  which  has  cost  them  around
    ï¿½10,000, "a cost which family members have helped  to  meet"  so  that,
    "just three days before the hearing, the Appellant had had  a  positive
    pregnancy test and she is due to have a scan in about two weeks'  time"
    (paragraph 9).

 4. The concern that the Appellant and her husband have now  is  that  they
    will not be able to access fertility treatment in Iraq, in addition  to
    the stress of having to return to that  country,  which  will  make  it
    harder for her to have a normal pregnancy thereafter.  Mr  [H]  himself
    came to the UK about twenty years ago, as an asylum seeker, and  he  is
    now settled in the UK.  He works as a painter  and  a  decorator.   His
    business depends on word of mouth and recommendations.  He could not go
    and live in Iraq because "there will be pressure on their  relationship
    if they were to  return  to  Iraq  due  to  a  stigma  associated  with
    childlessness" (paragraph 13).  In any event, the  Appellant's  husband
    did not have any  close  family  members  living  in  Iraq  any  longer
    (paragraph 14).  The judge found it to be the case that "their evidence
    was consistent and I found them truthful witnesses" (paragraph 7).

 5. In relation to the judge's findings, the judge made  two  observations.
    First, she concluded that "the Appellant  could  integrate  into  Iraqi
    society if she were to return" because she had lived there most of  her
    life, and that moreover "it will be possible for Mr  [H]  to  integrate
    into society" given that Mr [H] had made various visits over  the  last
    twenty years back to Iraq after his arrival in this country  (paragraph
    8).  The judge's conclusion was that  "there  is  no  reason  why  they
    cannot continue their family life in Iraq" (paragraph 18).

 6. The second observation that the judge made,  was  in  relation  to  the
    conduct of the proportionality exercise.  Here the judge  stated  that,
    "I accept that both the Appellant and Mr [H] have built  up  a  private
    life in the UK through employment, study  and  community  involvement".
    The judge then went on to say that, nevertheless, "in  the  Appellant's
    case there was never any guarantee that she would be able to remain  in
    the UK and I give her private life little weight".  In  particular,  as
    far as Mr [H] was concerned, "when he chose to marry the  Appellant  he
    knew or should have known that she would only be able to remain in  the
    UK if the requirements of the Immigration Rules were satisfied ...".

 7. In these circumstances one of the judge's conclusion was that, "I  find
    the legitimate aim of maintaining  proper  immigration  control  weighs
    more strongly in the balance than Mr [H]'s private  life".   The  judge
    then went on to consider the Section 117B considerations and  concluded
    that  the  public  interest  in  immigration  control   was   important
    (paragraph 20).

 8. The judge was not unsympathetic to the fact that the Appellant  and  Mr
    [H] were undergoing infertility treatment in the UK,  but  it  did  not
    appear to be the case that infertility treatment was not  available  in
    Iraq.  The judge came to this conclusion, "although I fully acknowledge
    the emotional difficulties caused by childlessness", but that  "it  has
    not been shown that there will be any risk to  the  Appellant's  or  Mr
    [H]'s health in returning to Iraq, even if treatment were very hard  to
    access there".

 9. In these circumstances, the judge held that, "I find that the fact that
    the couple are undergoing fertility treatment in  the  UK  raised  very
    little in their favour in the proportionality exercise that I  have  to
    undertake" (paragraph 22).

10. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

11. The grounds of application state that  the  judge  did  not  adequately
    consider the consequences to the Appellant in respect of a pregnancy if
    she is removed to Iraq.  It was not in dispute at the hearing that  the
    Appellant's pregnancy could require close monitoring, and  would  be  a
    pregnancy where the IVF team from Care would remain  linked  and  where
    the Appellant would derive considerable benefit from the  uninterrupted
    presence and care of her husband, who was  a  prospective  father,  who
    would remain in the United Kingdom.  Accordingly, the judge even failed
    to have  regard  to  the  fact  that  State  parties  have  a  positive
    obligation to promote a real family life.

12. Permission to appeal was granted on 16th May 2019  on  the  basis  that
    this could be one of  those  "very  rare  cases"  contemplated  by  the
    Tribunal in GS and EO (India) where reliance on Article 8 of the  Human
    Rights Convention might properly occur.  This was  endorsed  by  Akhalu
    (health claim: ECHR Article 8) Nigeria [2013] UKUT 400.

Submissions

13. At the hearing before me on 9th August 2018,  Mr  Ahmed,  appearing  as
    Counsel  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant,  relied  on  the  grounds   of
    application.  He has submitted that the  finding  that  there  were  no
    "insurmountable obstacles" by the judge, was not determinative  of  the
    entire proportionality exercise that had to be undertaken,  given  that
    the matter had to be reconsidered in any event outside the  Immigration
    Rules.

14. Therefore, although the judge could not really come to  the  conclusion
    that  under  the  Rules,  there  were  no  "insurmountable  obstacles",
    nevertheless, it was important to look at the position of the right  to
    family life outside the Immigration Rules.  In this regard,  the  judge
    had manifestly failed to do so.

15. This is because when  undertaking  the  proportionality  exercise,  the
    judge simply focuses upon the private life of the Appellant and Mr  [H]
    separately from each other.  There is no consideration of  their  right
    to family life as a couple.  This was clear from what the judge  states
    at paragraph 19.

16. Second, the conclusion that the balance  of  considerations  inevitably
    fell in favour of  the  Secretary  of  State's  policy  of  maintaining
    immigration control did not follow.  The  judge's  assessment  in  this
    regard had been unnecessarily one-sided when she observed that

         "Mr [H] does have a substantial private life in the UK but when  he
         chose to marry the Appellant he knew or should have known that  she
         would only be able to remain in the UK if the requirements  of  the
         Immigration Rules were satisfied ..." (paragraph 19).

17. This is because the family life interest between the parties  had  been
    created prior to the Appellant's entry to the UK.  Mr [H] had  gone  to
    Iraq in 2012 and married the Appellant there.  He was a British citizen
    and he was entitled to do so.  The Appellant had then entered the UK in
    a lawful manner.  She would have had every expectation of being able to
    live with her husband as his wife, as any normal wife  would  do.   She
    had not, after all, entered the UK illegally.




18. She had not developed her family life with him conscious  of  the  fact
    that her status was "precarious", in the sense  that  the  relationship
    had not been created in anything other than a normal and lawful  manner
    following which entry to the UK had followed as Mr  [H]'s  lawful  wife
    under the Immigration Rules.   The  judge's  failure  to  consider  the
    family  life  interest  between  them  led  to  a  particularly   harsh
    conclusion in the observation that, "I find  that  the  fact  that  the
    couple are undergoing fertility treatment in the UK weighs very  little
    in their favour ..." (paragraph 22).

19. For his part, Mr McVeety  submitted  that  the  leading  Supreme  Court
    judgment in Agyarko [2017] UKSC 1, involved a case where IVF  fertility
    treatment was being undertaken by one of the parties (see paragraphs 30
    to 32), but the court had held that this did not mean that  there  were
    "insurmountable obstacles" to return back to their home  country".   It
    was not the case that the judge's consideration  was  confined  to  the
    "private life" of the parties, because at paragraph 18,  the  judge  is
    considering the family life of the parties.  He had to accept that  the
    Appellant was now seven months pregnant and could not presently fly  to
    Iraq.  Nevertheless, at the time of the making  of  the  decision,  the
    findings made by the judge were open to her.

Error of Law

20. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside the decision.   My  reasons  are  as
    follows.  First, the judge has failed to take  into  account  the  fact
    that the Appellant entered as the lawful wife of Mr  [H],  following  a
    marriage in Iraq in 2012, and did so in a lawful manner on  a  spouse's
    visa, such that family life had been created between the  two  of  them
    prior to her entry to this country.  The judge failed to consider  this
    in  her  assessment  exercise.   Mr  McVeety  submits  that  there   is
    consideration of the family life between the two of them  at  paragraph
    18.  This is not so.  What is said there is  that  every  time  Mr  [H]
    returned back to Iraq over the last twenty years "he  found  family  or
    friends to stay with each time they returned to Iraq"  (paragraph  18).
    There is no  consideration  there  of  the  family  life  between  this
    lawfully wedded couple, namely, the Appellant and Mr [H].

21.  Secondly,  and  far  more  seriously,   in   terms   of   the   actual
    proportionality exercise that is  undertaken  (at  paragraph  19),  the
    judge is categorically clear that she is focusing only upon the private
    life of these two individuals when she begins with the statement  that,
    "I accept that both the Appellant and Mr [H] have built  up  a  private
    life in the UK through employment,  study  and  community  involvement"
    (paragraph 19).

22. It is because the focus is simply upon the fact  that  they  have  each
    built up a private life, that the judge  then  continues  in  the  next
    sentence on the basis that, "however, in the Appellant's case there was
    never any guarantee that she would be able in the UK  and  I  give  her
    private life little weight" (paragraph 19).

23. In the same way, when consideration is given to Mr [H], it was observed
    that

         "Mr [H] does have a substantial private life in the UK but when  he
         chose to marry the Appellant he knew or should have known that  she
         would only be able to remain in the UK if the requirements  of  the
         Immigration Rules were satisfied ..." (paragraph 19).

24. There is quite simply no consideration of the family life  between  the
    two of them.  Third, this is no less important because this is  a  case
    where the family life in question is that of a British citizen  who  is
    presently settled in the UK, namely, Mr [H].  In MM [2013]  EWHC  1900,
    Mr Justice Blake, observed that,

         "I consider that  British  nationality  is  of  importance  in  the
         present context, because if  the  spouse  cannot  obtain  admission
         under the Rules, and the citizen Sponsor wants to enjoy family life
         and matrimonial cohabitation following marriage he or she will have
         to leave the country of nationality in order to  do  so.   Even  if
         there are no insurmountable obstacles to a  British  citizen  doing
         so, this is a serious interference with the right of residence (see
         Pitchford LJ in Quila at [72])" (see MM at paragraph 104).

25. Accordingly, the judge's conclusion inevitably fell into error when she
    observes that, "I find that the legitimate aim  of  maintaining  proper
    immigration control weighs more strongly in the balance than  Mr  [H]'s
    private life" (paragraph 19).  This  has  in  turn  impacted  upon  the
    conclusions in the final paragraph (at paragraph 22), where  the  judge
    observes that, "I fully acknowledge the emotional  difficulties  caused
    by childlessness", but that, "even  if  treatment  were  very  hard  to
    access there".  This would have a very little  weight  as  far  as  the
    proportionality  exercise  was  concerned   (paragraph   22)   if   the
    proportionality exercise has only been undertaken  in  the  context  of
    each party's individual private life rights, but not  with  respect  to
    their family life.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal amounts to an error of law.   I  set
aside the decision  of  the  original  judge.   I  remake  the  decision  as
follows.  This appeal is remitted back to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  be
decided by a judge other than Judge Place, pursuant  to  Practice  Statement
7.2(b) of the Practice Directions.

An anonymity order is not made.
