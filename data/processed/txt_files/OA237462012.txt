For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant, PD, is a citizen of Zimbabwe. The appellant is a  minor.
    The appellant is applying for entry clearance to the UK as the child of
    a person settled in the UK  under  paragraph  297  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 2. I have considered whether or not it is appropriate to make an anonymity
    direction.  The case concerns the status and rights of a minor.  Having
    considered all of the circumstances I consider it necessary to make  an
    anonymity direction.

 3. This is an appeal against the determination  of  Designated  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Baird promulgated on 21st July 2014.   Leave  to  appeal
    was granted on 29th August 2014. The leave raises the issue of whether
    the judge has approached the issue of sole responsibility in accordance
    with the case of TD (paragraph 297 (i)(e)  sole  responsibility)  Yemen
    [2006] UKAIT 00049. The leave thereafter grants permission  to  appeal.
    There was no limitation on the grounds that can be raised before me.

 4. Thus the case appeared before me as an appeal in the Upper Tribunal  to
    determine in the first instance whether there is a  material  error  of
    law within the determination.

 5. The date of the ECO's decision is the 5th November 2012. By Section  85
    and 85 A of the 2002 Act as amend the appeal has to  be  determined  in
    accordance with the evidence pertaining to the date  of  the  decision.
    The application had been made on 10 September 2012.

 6. Judge Baird had refused this appeal on two main grounds. The first, the
    issue raised in the leave, related to whether the sponsor had had  sole
    responsibility for the appellant and the second related to finances, in
    that the income  of  the  sponsor  was  insufficient  to  maintain  the
    appellant and herself in accordance with the requirements of the rules.



 7. In respect of the appellant's finances the  matter  is  dealt  with  in
    paragraph 7 of the determination. The accounts of the sponsor disclosed
    a net yearly profit/income from self-employment between 29 July 2012 on
    30 June 2013 of �7720. Thus the sponsor had  a  net  weekly  income  of
    �148.46.

 8. Within the VAF it was stated that  the  sponsor's  monthly  income  was
    �2200. It  was  also  asserted  that  the  sponsor  was  working  as  a
    hairdresser 10 hours a week and earning �300. I draw specific attention
    to paragraph 8.7.12 where it was asked whether or not the  sponsor  had
    any savings and it was stated that she had none.

 9. In order to meet the requirements of the rules the sponsor has to  have
    sufficient to support herself and  the  appellant  to  the  adequately,
    which has been taken as being at a level equivalent  to  the  level  of
    social security/benefits payments.

10. The level of benefits for a single person with a child  is  �71.00  for
    the sponsor plus �64.99 for the child plus �22.20 family premium  as  a
    single parent  plus  rent  and  council  tax  payments/housing  benefit
    payments. The sponsor would therefore  need  income  of  �138.19  after
    taking account of her rent and council tax.

11. The sponsor's rent was �60.09p at  the  time  of  the  decision.  After
    paying the rent the sponsor would therefore be  left  with  �88.35  net
    income resulting in a weekly shortfall of �49.84p. During the course of
    the hearing the appellant's representative stated  that  the  shortfall
    was �39.75p. I do not have the calculations upon which that  figure  is
    based.

12. In order to make up the shortfall the sponsor was seeking to rely  upon
    money that she had in her bank account.

13. At the time of the original application the sponsor's bank account  had
    on the bank statements provided a credit balance  of  �217.51.  On  the
    basis of that evidence the appellant and the sponsor could not meet the
    financial requirements of the rules.

14. However the sponsor  had  produced  further  bank  statements  for  the
    hearing. Those bank statements indicated on  and  after  9  November  a
    series of deposits were made into the account. Those deposits  are  not
    consistent with the history of the account. On 9 November 2012 �400 was
    paid in; on 12 November 2012 �458; on 15 November �500; on 19  November
    �500; and on 20 November �1000.  A  total  of  �2,858.   To  cover  the
    deficit between the income and  social  benefits  payment  the  savings
    would last just over a year and a little  over  a  month  [57  weeks  x
    �49.48= �2820.36] or approximately a year and 19  weeks  if  the  lower
    figure is taken. [71 x 39.75 = �2,822.25] [although as  these  are  the
    only funds the cost of a flight to the UK would also have to  be  taken
    out].

15.  There seemed to be a number of issues with regard to the source of the
    money. No reference had been made in the VAF to  any  savings  at  all.
    According to the sponsor these are monies that were owed to her.  There
    is no assessment of  whether  it  is  accepted  that  the  monies  were
    genuinely owed her and had  merely  been  repaid  to  or  whether  that
    explanation was accepted. Equally there is no assessment as to  whether
    or not in light of the savings the appellant and the sponsor could meet
    the requirements of the rules. With that  in  mind  consideration  will
    have to be given to the cases of Jahangara Begum & others (maintenance:
    savings) Bangladesh [2011] UKUT 00246(IAC)  and KA and others (Adequacy
    of Maintenance) Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065.

16. The second issue  raised  within  the  determination  relates  to  sole
    responsibility. In the determination the judge has stated in  paragraph
    17 that:-

         It may well be that all the significant decisions in his life would
         be made by the Sponsor and indeed  some  of  the  less  significant
         decisions such as perhaps being allowed to go on an outing, but  in
         practical terms it must leave the case that his  grandmother  makes
         many decisions for him in the course of a week.

17. As identified in the case law the principal issue in  determining  sole
    responsibility is who  has  made  all  the  significant  decisions  and
    directed the life of the child. The case however  recognises  that  the
    day-to-day decisions may have to be made by  people  that  are  present
    with the child on a day-to-day basis.

18. In the circumstances it appears that the judge has failed to apply  the
    guidance  in  the  case  of  TD   (Paragraph   297(i)(e)   ;   "   sole
    responsibility") Yemen UKAIT 00049. Equally it appears that  the  judge
    has failed to make decisions as to whether or  not  the  funds  in  the
    account and the sponsor are genuinely available to the  sponsor  to  be
    used in the system the support of the appellant and whether taking into
    account those  savings  there  is  sufficient  funds  to  maintain  the
    appellant.

19. There is therefore a material error of law  within  the  determination.
    The proper course appears to me for the appeal to be remitted  back  to
    the First-tier Tribunal hearing a fresh on the issues identified. I see
    no reason to revisit the other requirements of the rules as it has been
    found to the benefit of the appellant that he meets the requirements.

20. Accordingly for the reasons set out I find that there  is  no  material
    error of law within the determination and remit the case  back  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for a hearing on the issues identified.
