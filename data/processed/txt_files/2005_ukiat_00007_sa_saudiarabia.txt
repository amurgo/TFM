                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


For the Appellant:           Mr. C. Trent, Home Office Presenting Officer.
For the Respondent:    Mr. S. Muquit, Counsel.

1.    The Appellant, the Secretary of State for the  Home  Department,  has
    been  granted  permission  to  appeal  to  the  tribunal  against   the
    determination of an Adjudicator (Mr.  J.  Simpson)  promulgated  on  16
    February 2004, when he allowed the appeal of the Respondent against the
    decision of the Appellant dated  31  October  2001  to  refuse  to  the
    Respondent a variation of his leave to remain in the United Kingdom  in
    business as a self-employed lawyer.

2.    We have decided to allow the appeal of the Secretary of State.
3.    The basis of the Appellant's refusal to vary the  Respondent's  leave
    was that the Secretary of State was not satisfied that  the  Respondent
    could show audited accounts that  demonstrated  the  precise  financial
    position of the Respondent's business, nor that he could show  that  he
    was actively involved on a full-time  basis  in  trading  or  providing
    services on his own account or in partnership or in the  promotion  and
    management of the company as a director.   Furthermore,  the  Appellant
    was not satisfied that the Respondent could show that his share of  the
    profits of the business was  sufficient  to  accommodate  him  and  his
    dependants without recourse to employment (other than his work for  the
    business) or to  public  funds.   Ms  D.K.  Gill,  Vice  President,  in
    granting permission to appeal observed as follows:

      "The  Adjudicator  allowed  the  appeal  against  the  refusal  under
         paragraph 206 of the Immigration Rules.  In doing  so,  he  stated
         that he would take a pragmatic approach  and  would  exercise  his
         discretion to allow the appeal.

      The grounds assert that there is no discretion  under  paragraph  206
         and that, if the requirements of paragraph 206 are not  met,  then
         refusal is mandatory under paragraph 208.

      The grounds are arguable.  It is arguable that the Adjudicator had no
         jurisdiction to  allow  the  appeal,  as  he  had  concluded  (see
         paragraph 21) that the decision was lawful".

4.    The grounds of appeal were as follows:

      "1.   The  Adjudicator  has  allowed  this  non-asylum  appeal  under
         paragraph 206 of HC 395.

      2.    At paragraph 20 of the determination the Adjudicator states  'I
         am satisfied as a fact that due to  the  solicitor's  default  the
         Appellant failed to comply  with  the  requirements  of  paragraph
         206(ii) and that the  Respondent  was  entitled  on  the  evidence
         before him at  the  date  of  decision  to  refuse  the  extension
         requested on that ground'.  However  following  deliberating  over
         various factors relating  to  the  Respondent's  circumstances  at
         paragraph 21, the Adjudicator, at paragraph 22, states 'For  these
         reasons, I have decided to take a pragmatic approach and  exercise
         my discretion to allow this appeal.

      It is submitted that the Adjudicator erred in law in  exercising  his
         discretion  and  allowing  the  appeal  because   there   are   no
         discretionary powers  for  the  Adjudicator  to  exercise  in  the
         particular area of the Rules, which the  Adjudicator  was  dealing
         with.  Rule 208 HC 395 states unambiguously that 'an extension  of
         stay in order to remain in  business  is  to  be  refused  if  the
         Secretary of State is not satisfied that each of the  requirements
         of paragraph 206 is met'.

      Whilst some areas of the Rules allow for the exercise of  discretion,
         e.g. Rule 322(2-11) which is prefaced  by  'Grounds  on  which  an
         application to vary leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
         should normally be refused', Rule 206 is unequivocal.

      It is submitted that the proper  course  is  for  the  appeal  to  be
         dismissed  and  a  further  application  submitted  to  allow  the
         Secretary of State the opportunity to assess  any  evidence  which
         clearly post-dates the decision.

      3.    It is submitted that this determination is flawed and should be
         set aside".

5.     The Tribunal received  a  letter  from  the  Appellant's  solicitors
    Messrs. Aston  Clark  dated  17  November  2004  that  in  addition  to
    enclosing their Counsel's skeleton  argument  and  other  documentation
    explained that the Respondent's two  eldest  dependants  had  submitted
    applications for indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom which
    were pending consideration at the Home Office.  They continued:

      "Likewise,  the  (Respondent)  has  submitted  a  further  and  fresh
         application for an extension to his leave to remain given that  he
         continues to satisfy all the requirements necessary to be met  for
         a business person seeking further leave in the UK".

6.    We  noted  that  within  the  Respondent's  skeleton  argument  there
    appeared before paragraph 28 a sub-heading marked "Cross Appeal".  That
    raised submissions relating to issues that it was  contended  concerned
    Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the "ECHR").

7.    Mr. Muquit submitted that as such, a cross appeal had been  filed  in
    time.

8.    There  were  strong  objections  raised  by  Mr.  Trent  who  rightly
    submitted that the requirements of Rule 19 had not been complied with.

9.    The Tribunal carefully considered the request to admit that which Mr.
    Muquit described as a Respondent's notice.  Rule 19(2) requires that  a
    notice must be filed
      (a)   within such period as the Tribunal may direct; or
      (b)   where the Tribunal makes no such direction, within 10 days,

      after the Respondent is served with notice  that  the  Appellant  has
    been granted permission to appeal.  It was noteworthy that as Mr. Trent
    pointed out, the cross appeal had not been served upon  the  Respondent
    in compliance with the Rules.

10.   Mr. Muquit submitted that there was an overriding discretion  of  the
    Tribunal to permit a Respondent's Notice notwithstanding the failure to
    strictly comply with the Rules.

11.   We did not agree and indeed observe that Mr. Muquit's submission  was
    doubtless derived from Rule 37 of the 2003 Rules.  This  provides  that
    the Appellate Authority "may, subject to these Rules, and to any  other
    enactment, decide the procedure to  be  followed  in  relation  to  any
    appeal or application".

12.   With respect to Mr. Muquit, the problem with  his  submission  is  of
    course that the words "subject to  these  Rules"  in  Rule  37  clearly
    indicate  that  the  discretion   of   the   Appellate   Authority   is
    circumscribed by what is to be found in the  other  provisions  of  the
    Rules, including Rule 19(2).

13.   The Tribunal considers  that  even  if  there  is  power  within  the
    Procedure Rules to enable it to permit  a  Respondent's  notice  to  be
    served upon the Appellant outside the time limit set by Rule 19(2),  it
    would only be appropriate to exercise it if good reason could be  shown
    for the Respondent not to have filed the notice and served a copy  upon
    the Appellant within the requisite timescale.  In the present  case  no
    such reason existed.

14.   Mr. Muquit told us that it was his understanding that a copy  of  the
    "cross appeal" had been served upon the Home Office but Mr.  Trent  was
    able to tell us that no such record of service appeared within the Home
    Office file before him.

15.   It was indeed noteworthy that Mr. Muquit frankly admitted  (following
    an expression of our concern that  his  instructing  solicitors  should
    appreciate the necessity to comply with the requirements of  Rule  19),
    that this was a matter that he had previously drawn to the attention of
    those instructing him.  We observed in such circumstances that this was
    yet a further example of the failure of those instructing him  to  heed
    his advice and comply with the strict requirements of the Rules.

16.   In the circumstances we were not prepared to permit the cross  appeal
    tendered.

17.    Both  parties  recognised  that  the   Adjudicator's   determination
    disclosed material errors of law.

18.   It was Mr. Muquit's submission that the material  error  lay  in  the
    Adjudicator's  approach  in  that  he  should  have  found   that   the
    Appellant's decision  was  not  in  accordance  with  the  law  or  the
    Immigration Rules applicable to this case.

19.   He otherwise shared the view of Mr. Trent with which we wholly agree.

20.   At paragraph 20 of his determination the Adjudicator stated:

      "I am satisfied as a fact that due to  the  solicitor's  default  the
         Appellant failed to comply  with  the  requirements  of  paragraph
         206(ii) and that the  Respondent  was  entitled  on  the  evidence
         before him at  the  date  of  decision  to  refuse  the  extension
         requested on that ground".

21.   Clearly on that finding the proper course for the  Adjudicator  would
    have been to dismiss the Respondent's appeal.  Instead  he  appears  to
    have allowed the appeal not for reasons  of  law  but  for  reasons  of
    pragmatism.  Indeed the Adjudicator made this  clear  at  paragraph  22
    when he stated:

      "I have  decided  to  take  a  pragmatic  approach  and  exercise  my
         discretion to allow this appeal".

22.   Mr. Trent submitted that he relied on the grounds of appeal to  which
    he added that it was not reasonably  foreseeable  that  the  Respondent
    could meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  Indeed paragraph
    208 of HC 395 was clear in its terms, namely:

      "208.  An extension of stay in order to remain in business is  to  be
         refused if the Secretary of State is not satisfied  that  each  of
         the requirements of paragraph 206 is met".

23.   Mr. Trent continued that paragraph 208 did apply  and  therefore  the
    application had to be refused.

24.    For  the  sake  of  completeness  we  would  set  out  the  relevant
    requirements of paragraph 206 of HC 395 insofar as they relate  to  the
    circumstances of this appeal:

      "206.   The requirements for an extension of stay in order to  remain
         in business in the United Kingdom are that the applicant can show:

      (ii)  audited accounts which show the precise financial  position  of
              the business and which confirm that he has invested not  less
              than �200,000 of his own money directly into the business  in
              the United Kingdom and

      (iii) that he is actively involved on a full-time basis in trading or
              providing services on his own account or in partnership or in
              the promotion and management of the company as a director and

      (iv)  that his level of financial investment is proportional  to  his
              interest in the business".

25.   The requirements of paragraph 206(i)-(x) are cumulative and therefore
    failure to comply with any one of the requirements of the Rule would be
    fatal to an application.

26.   It is apparent from the  papers  before  us  and  indeed  before  the
    Adjudicator, that on 4 September 2001 the  Home  Office  wrote  to  the
    Respondent's solicitors following their client's application of 2  July
    2001 for further leave to remain  as  a  self-employed  lawyer  in  the
    United Kingdom and on behalf of his wife and children for further leave
    as his  dependants.   The  Home  Office  in  their  letter  listed  the
    documents before them and continued:

      "However, to  enable  your  client's  application  to  be  considered
         further, could  you  please  arrange  for  the  following  further
         evidence to be forwarded to us.

      (1)   Please forward the letter from the  Law  Society  to  the  Home
             Office confirming  there  is  no  objection  to  Mr.  Alothaim
             continuing to practise in the UK as an attorney consultant  in
             Shari'ah law (i.e.  the  enclosure  to  the  letter  mentioned
             above).

       (2)    Please  forward  up-to-date  evidence  that  your  client  is
             practising as a self-employed consultant  accordingly  and  is
             earning  sufficient  profit  from  this   self-employment   to
             maintain  and  accommodate  himself  e.g.  accounts  for   his
             business for the previous year and latest balance sheet with a
             copy of his tax return".

27.   On 18 September 2001 the Respondent's solicitors replied and enclosed
    the letter of 20 June 2001 addressed to the Home  Office  and  the  Law
    Society.  As regards the Home Office's request as set out at (2) above,
    the solicitors stated as follows:

      "At this stage we are unable to provide our client's accounts for the
         business, balance sheet or tax return.

      Since obtaining permission to practise from the Law Society  and  the
         appropriate visa from the Home Office last year,  our  client  has
         commenced actions with a view to establishing a business.

      For example, he has undertaken extensive building work  at  his  home
         address to build an office, and we enclose a copy of the  building
         plans for your reference.

      He has arranged for  his  practice  to  be  advertised  with  various
         institutions in Saudi  Arabia  together  with  the  Saudi  Arabian
         Embassy in London (letter enclosed for your reference).

      He is currently seeking an appointment with a bank  to  organise  the
         opening of a business account together with instructing a suitable
         accountant to be responsible for his business accounts.

      He has received a number of telephone enquiries from persons  seeking
         his advice (referred to him from the Embassy) whom he has assisted
         with general advice.  No charge for this advice has yet been  made
         until his business is fully running,  together  with  his  opinion
         that these pro bono  advices  shall  lead  to  more  goodwill  and
         advertisement of his services  for  the  future  building  of  the
         business.

      As we are sure that  you  will  appreciate,  such  a  niche  area  of
         practice will take time to establish itself, although  our  client
         is confident that in time for next year's  renewal,  he  shall  be
         able to produce some form of business accounts.

       With  respect  to  the  requirement  that  our  client  is  able  to
         accommodate and support himself and his family without recourse to
         public funds, we are sure  that  the  bank  statements  previously
         provided  to  you  shall  confirm  that  our  client's   financial
         circumstances allow him to comfortably  support  himself  and  his
         family.  In due course he hopes that the income generated from his
         business will  in  itself  be  sufficient  for  accommodation  and
         support of him and his family.

      We  trust  that  the  information  provided  in  this  letter  is  in
         satisfaction of your request, and that  our  client's  application
         for an extension to his  leave  to  remain  in  the  UK  shall  be
         favourably concluded".

28.   The point about the above reply  is  that  it  did  not  provide  the
    information that was specifically required under the provisions of  not
    least paragraph 206(ii) of HC 395.

29.   We would however clarify that as  pointed  out  by  Mr.  Muquit,  the
    Respondent as an overseas lawyer was not required to show that  he  had
    invested not less than �200,000 of his  own  money  directly  into  the
    business in the United Kingdom.  However it is apparent that he was not
    providing audited accounts that showed the precise  financial  position
    of the business.

30.   Mr. Muquit submitted that that these requirements  should  have  been
    reasonably foreseeable as being met on the part  of  the  Secretary  of
    State in that as the Adjudicator had noted from the bundle of documents
    before him:

      "The first trading period dated 14 December 2001 were prepared  ready
         to be approved by the Appellant which is a matter of only 6  weeks
         after the date of refusal and 12 weeks after the  deficient  reply
         from the Appellant's solicitors".

31.   Mr. Muquit maintained that the Secretary of State had failed to place
    matters in their historical context.  This was not,  he  submitted,  an
    application in isolation.  The Respondent had arrived in  this  country
    following the grant of a student  visa  and  had  subsequently  made  a
    successful application under the Rules to conduct a business as a self-
    employed lawyer, a consultant in Sharia law, that had been granted  for
    twelve months on 12 July 2000.  The fact that the  Respondent  met  all
    the requirements of those particular Rules  in  order  to  obtain  such
    entry clearance should have been a factor which the Secretary of  State
    could have taken into account.  Further, Mr. Muquit  argued,  Rule  206
    only required that the  Respondent  could  show  for  example,  audited
    accounts, not that they should actually be produced in support  of  the
    application.

32.   We were not persuaded by those submissions.  Indeed with  respect  to
    Mr. Muquit, it flies in the face of commonsense to suggest that "show,"
    means an ability to produce required evidence under the  relevant  Rule
    at some indeterminate date in the future.  Were that to be so, it would
    frankly make nonsense of the Rules.  We conclude this  is  not  a  case
    that relates to future intentions.  Rule 206 obligates the applicant to
    produce the required evidence at the time of the application.
33.   Indeed  this  was  directly  observed  by  the  Adjudicator  when  at
    paragraph 19 of his determination the Adjudicator continued as follows:

      "I suspect those accounts were in the process of  being  prepared  by
         the Appellant's accountants at the time the  solicitors  wrote  to
         the Respondent in September and had the  solicitors  informed  the
         Respondent of this with a request to defer a decision for a  short
         time pending  production  of  the  accounts  it  would  have  been
         granted.  Had this been done it  is  likely  the  application  for
         extension would have been granted and  the  Appellant  would  have
         been spared the anxiety and expense of this appeal".

34.   He was therefore  correct  in  continuing  at  paragraph  20  of  his
    determination as follows:

      "I am satisfied as a fact that due to  the  solicitor's  default  the
         Appellant failed to comply  with  the  requirements  of  paragraph
         206(ii) and that the  Respondent  was  entitled  on  the  evidence
         before him at  the  date  of  decision  to  refuse  the  extension
         requested on that ground".

35.   It was Mr. Trent's submissions with which we entirely concur, that at
    that stage of the determination it only remained for the Adjudicator to
    dismiss the Respondent's appeal and his failure to do so and even worse
    to allow the  appeal  not  on  legal  principles  but  for  reasons  of
    pragmatism was a clear and material error of law.

36.   Rule 206 requires there to be a pre-existing  business  with  audited
    accounts.  If they are not there then the Rules  are  simply  not  met.
    The Secretary of State had asked for further information to  facilitate
    the application but it was  not  provided.   Insofar  as  Rule  208  is
    concerned we reject Mr. Muquit's submission that it is implicit  within
    the Rule that the Secretary of State  has  a  discretion  that  he  may
    exercise.  The Rule is clear.   It  does  not  disclose  a  discretion.
    Either the  Secretary  of  State  is  or  is  not  satisfied  that  the
    requirements of Rule 206 are met.  To be satisfied is a matter of  fact
    and not a matter of discretion.  The Rule is clear:

      "208.  An extension of stay in order to remain in business is  to  be
         refused if the Secretary of State is not satisfied  that  each  of
         the requirements of paragraph 206 is met".

       In  this  case  for  reasons  which  were  abundantly  obvious,  the
    requirements of Rule 206 were  not  met  and  the  Secretary  of  State
    therefore properly refused  the  application  in  compliance  with  the
    Rules.

37.   Mr. Muquit had referred us to the decision  of  the  Tribunal  in  CA
    (Date of decision - Evidence)  Nigeria  [2004]  UKIAT  00243  where  at
    paragraph 7 the Deputy President Mr. C.M.G. Ockleton had  stated  inter
    alia:

      "In assessing the circumstances at any particular date in  the  past,
         it is right to look at evidence subsequent to that date,  provided
         that the evidence is relevant to assessing what the  circumstances
         were on that date.  This is a rule of commonsense as well as being
         a very well-established rule of law - so well established that  no
         authority is necessary, although perhaps R v IAT ex parte  Kotecha
         [1982] Imm AR 88 will serve."

38.   With respect to Mr. Muquit what he fails to appreciate  is  that  the
    circumstances in this case were  that  the  Respondent  was  unable  to
    comply with the mandatory requirements of the  relevant  Rule  in  that
    inter alia he was unable to produce audited accounts.  The Secretary of
    State could not have considered it reasonably foreseeable even  if,  as
    Mr. Muquit contends and as found by implication by the Adjudicator, the
    solicitors had failed to make entirely clear the applicant's  position,
    namely that it is claimed by the solicitors in the grounds of appeal:

      "In the first year of business, from July  2000,  (the  Respondent's)
         accountants are not required to submit a tax return  with  audited
         accounts until January 2002.   Therefore,  such  audited  accounts
         were not available at the time of submission  of  the  application
         for an extension of his leave.  This was explained and should have
         been accepted as a reasonable explanation".

39.   However as the Adjudicator rightly observed at paragraph  18  of  his
    determination:

      "Whilst I  accept  this  is  an  adequate  explanation  for  the  non
         existence of a tax return it is wholly inadequate with  regard  to
         non provision of  audited  accounts  and  displays  a  fundamental
         failure by  the  solicitors  to  distinguish  between  fiscal  and
         immigration requirements.  Paragraph 206(ii) of HC  395  makes  it
         abundantly clear that for immigration purposes an  application  to
         extend leave to remain has to be supported  by  audited  accounts.
         This  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  Inland   Revenue   taxation
         requirements  to  which  different  provisions   apply   and   the
         (Respondent's) solicitors' failure to  understand  the  difference
         has placed the (Respondent) and his  family  in  grave  danger  of
         having the present appeal refused as it is  manifestly  plain  the
         (Respondent) has failed to comply with paragraph 206(ii)".

40.   Mr. Muquit further referred us to the decision of the Tribunal in  SS
    Malaysia [2004] UKIAT 00091 that held inter alia that  in  relation  to
    events that took place after a  decision  had  been  made  the  correct
    reasoning to apply to section 65 appeals was that set out  in  Kotecha,
    namely that the question of whether an entry clearance decision was  in
    accordance with the law, was to  be  determined  by  the  circumstances
    prevailing at the time of the ECO's decision.  There might  however  be
    instances where post-decision events  would  be  admissible  where  for
    example such events would illuminate what had  previously  occurred  or
    related to events that were  reasonably  foreseeable  at  the  date  of
    decision.

41.   We now deal with the question of reasonable foreseeability and  post-
    decision evidence.  The position at the date of decision in  this  case
    was that this Respondent was unable to meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules.  The fact that he might have been able to do so at a later  date
    is irrelevant.

42.   Further and as we pointed out to  Mr.  Muquit,  paragraph  2  of  the
    Immigration Rules HC 395 state as follows:

      "Immigration Officers, Entry Clearance Officers and all staff at  the
         Home Office Immigration and Nationality (Directorate)  will  carry
         out their duties without regard to the race, colour or religion of
         persons seeking to enter or remain in the United Kingdom  (and  in
         compliance of the provisions of the Human Rights Act 1998)".

      There is nothing about the requirements of Article 8 of the ECHR that
    negates the need for this Respondent to comply with the requirement  of
    the Immigration Rules as regards the  production  of  audited  accounts
    that had to be produced at the time the application was made.

43.   Article 8 is not there to  permit  a  claimant  to  opt  out  of  the
    requirements of the Rules on the basis that had  his  application  been
    made at a later date he would have been able to meet  the  requirements
    of the Rules.

44.   We are mindful, as indeed was the Adjudicator, that the claimant  had
    been lawfully in  the  United  Kingdom  and  had  attempted  to  secure
    immigration permission lawfully to operate his business and that he and
    his family were "well integrated in the United Kingdom  and  have  been
    here for 8� years".  Further that the claimant  was  as  found  by  the
    Adjudicator to be a highly educated and well qualified man  offering  a
    specialised service not readily available from  others.   However,  the
    Respondent failed to produce audited accounts, that being a significant
    feature of the application without which it could properly be said that
    the  Respondent  had  not  established  his   entitlement   under   the
    Immigration Rules for leave to remain. Therefore, if as in the case  of
    this Respondent, he did not comply with the Rules, for a  reason  which
    could not be described as an insignificant non-compliance, we find that
    there is no reason why Article 8 should assist the Respondent to  avoid
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules which are in themselves Human
    Rights Act compliant.

45.   For the above reasons we find that the decision of the  Secretary  of
    State was  in  accordance  with  the  law  and  the  Immigration  Rules
    applicable to this case.  Further the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of
    State did not place the United Kingdom in  breach  of  its  obligations
    under Article 8 of the ECHR.

46.   We therefore allow the appeal of the Secretary of State.
