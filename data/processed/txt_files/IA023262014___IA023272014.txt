Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Afzal (Legal Representative)
For the Respondent:    Mrs Pettersen (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The first-named appellant (hereinafter referred to as  the  appellant),
    born March 8, 1966 and the second named appellant is his daughter, born
    September 26, 1988. They are both citizens of Pakistan. The appellant's
    wife and other child are  dependants  on  his  application.  They  both
    submitted applications for leave to remain  under  article  8  ECHR  on
    January 25, 2012. These applications were refused without  a  right  of
    appeal but following a request for reconsideration dated June  8,  2012
    the respondent reconsidered their  applications  but  refused  them  on
    December 16, 2013. At the same time a  decision  was  taken  to  remove
    them.

 2. The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under Section  82(1)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on January 6, 2014.
    On June 6, 2014 Judge of the First Tier Tribunal T  Jones  (hereinafter
    referred to as the "FtTJ") heard their appeals. He  refused  all  their
    appeals  under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  article  8  ECHR   in   a
    determination promulgated on June 25, 2014.

 3. The appellants lodged grounds of appeal on July 2, 2014 and on July 14,
    2014 Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Levin  granted  permission  to
    appeal finding it arguable the FtTJ had possibly erred  in  considering
    the appeal under the new  Immigration  Rules  as  the  application  was
    lodged before July 9, 2014 and it was also arguable the  FtTJ  had  not
    taken into account the best interests of the children.

 4. The appellants and family  attended  the  hearing  before  me  and  was
    represented by Mr Afzal.

    SUBMISSIONS


 5. Mr Afzal adopted his  grounds  of  appeal  and  skeleton  argument  and
    submitted:


      a. The FtTJ erred by considering the appeal under the  new  rules.  As
         the application had been made before July 9,  2012  the  respondent
         and FtTJ should have considered the appeal without having regard to
         Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE.  By  considering  the  case  under
         those Rules the FtTJ materially erred.


      b. The FtTJ failed to have regard to the respondent's  own  policy  on
         children who had been in the United Kingdom for over  seven  years.
         The appellant's children including the second-named had been in the
         United Kingdom for over seven years and the  respondent  failed  to
         have regard to the provisions of EX.1 of Appendix FM which provides
         for leave to be granted where a child has been here  for  at  least
         seven years. The second appellant has been here for 9 �  years  and
         there are no countervailing circumstances  requiring  her  removal.
         The FtTJ failed to have  regard  to  Section  55  of  the  Borders,
         Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.


 6. Mrs Pettersen responded  to  the  appellants'  grounds  of  appeal  and
    submitted there was no error in law. She submitted:

      a. The grounds of appeal had no basis.


      b. The appellants had not made an  application  under  the  Rules  and
         accordingly the respondent correctly considered  the  appeal  under
         the new Rules. The Court in Edgehill v SSHD  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  402
         made clear that where an  application  under  the  Rules  was  made
         before July 2012 then it should be considered under the old  Rules.
         Paragraph A277 states:


             "From 9 July 2012 Appendix FM will apply to  all  applications
             to which Part 8 of these rules applied on  or  before  8  July
             2012 except where the provisions of Part 8 are  preserved  and
             continue to apply, as set out in paragraph A280."


      c. The appellant  had  not  made  an  application  under  any  of  the
         provisions of part  8  and  the  FtTJ  was  perfectly  entitled  to
         consider the application as he did.


      d. In any event, the FtTJ clearly considered the appeal under  article
         8 as demonstrated by his approach in paragraphs  [23],  [25],  [32]
         and [33]. At paragraph [34] he dismissed the appeals under  article
         8 ECHR. In reaching his decision he clearly had regard  to  section
         55 of the 2009 Act.


      e. Mr Afzal argued that the FtTJ erred by considering the appeal under
         the new Rules but also sought to argue that the  respondent  should
         have had regard to the policy guidance from 2014 when  applications
         were considered under the  new  Rules.  In  any  event  the  second
         appellant did not meet the requirement of the Rules because she and
         her sibling only arrived in the United Kingdom on  June  14,  2005.
         The children could not demonstrate at least seven years at the date
         of application as the seven year period would mean the  application
         would have to  have  been  made  after  June  14,  2012  and  these
         applications were initially made  on  January  12,  2012  and  then
         renewed on June 8, 2012. The period was less than seven  years  and
         any policy did not apply.


      f.    There was no error in law.


 7. Mr Afzal responded to those submissions and questions posed  by  myself
    as follows:


      a. The transitional provisions apply to all cases where there has been
         an application under the  Rules.  This  was  a  reconsideration  of
         earlier decisions so was caught by the transitional provisions.


      b. Whilst noting the calculation of time spent  here  by  the  second-
         named appellant he submitted that the guidance should be taken into
         account as she had now been here for 9 � years.


      c.  The  finding  in  paragraph  [34]  of  the  determination  was   a
         "throwaway" comment.


 8. I reserved my decision on all issues.

    MY FINDINGS ON ERROR IN LAW

 9. The main thrust of this appeal was that  the  FtTJ  wrongly  considered
    this application under the new Rules and  should  have  considered  the
    appeal under the old Rules.


10. Having listened to the submissions I am satisfied Mr Afzal's submission
    is flawed. Both the application submitted in January and June 2012 were
    applications for "discretionary leave to remain in the UK on the  basis
    of the most compelling and compassionate grounds under article 8 ECHR".
    The renewal letter dated June 8, 2012 refers to the fact the respondent
    had refused this application without a right of  appeal  and  the  June
    letter purely deals with an article 8 application.

11. The transitional provisions of the Immigration  Rules  as  set  out  in
    paragraphs A277 to A280 make it clear the application has to  be  under
    the Rules and a part 8 application. This application was not under  the
    Rules. This issue was argued before the FtTJ and he came  to  the  same
    conclusion as I do. Although permission was granted on this point I  am
    satisfied that the rules and the case of Edgehill make  it  clear  that
    applications under specified Rules made before July 9, 2012 are  to  be
    dealt with under the old Rules so the appellant is not  prejudiced.  As
    this was an application under article 8 ECHR the  respondent  and  FtTJ
    were correct in their approach.

12. The second issue raised related to policy guidance. It  is  clear  that
    neither child were covered by the policy because neither had accrued  7
    years stay at the date of application and the  second  named  appellant
    was over the age of eighteen when the application  was  lodged  in  any
    event. The FtTJ did not err in the circumstances  in  her  approach  to
    this issue.

13. The FtTJ clearly had regard to all of the circumstances.  In  paragraph
    [32] of his determination the  FtTJ  considered  the  position  of  the
    youngest child and made clear he had considered the best  interests  of
    the child.  He  further  considered  the  position  of  the  family  in
    paragraph [33] and in light of the decision of EV (Phillipines) & Ors v
    SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 874  the  FtTJ  was  perfectly  entitled  to  find
    removal of the family including the younger child was proportionate.

14. The FtTJ clearly considered  the  position  under  the  new  rules  and
    article 8 ECHR. He clearly considers proportionality and dismisses  the
    appeals under article 8 ECHR in paragraph [34] of his determination.

15. There is no error in law.

    DECISION


16. There was no material error of law and  the  original  decisions  shall
    stand both in respect of the Immigration Rules and article 8 ECHR.

17. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order has been made and no request for an order was submitted to me.
