                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Jarvis, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Mosaku of Emerald Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent is a Nigerian national who  was  born  on  15  September
    1983.  She entered the United Kingdom in 2007, holding entry  clearance
    as a student.  She was subsequently granted further periods of leave to
    remain as a student and then under Tier 1 of the Points Based System.

 2. From 2016 onwards, the  respondent  made  applications  for  Indefinite
    Leave to Remain.  The first two applications were made under Tier 1  of
    the PBS.  These were refused without a  right  of  appeal.   The  third
    application was based on the accrual of ten  years'  continuous  lawful
    residence,  under  paragraph  276B  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   That
    application was made by the respondent on 22 December 2017 and  refused
    by the Secretary of State on 12 January 2019.

 3. The  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  application  under  paragraphs
    276B(ii)(c), (iii) and paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.  Each
    of these grounds of refusal was the result of the Secretary of  State's
    conclusion that the respondent  had  employed  deception  in  her  past
    dealings with the Home Office or  Her  Majesty's  Revenue  and  Customs
    ("HMRC").  The Secretary of State noted  that  there  were  significant
    discrepancies between the amount of self-employed earnings declared  by
    the respondent to HMRC in the years 2010/2011  and  2012/2013  and  the
    self-employed earnings relied upon by the  respondent  in  applications
    for leave to remain.   The  Secretary  of  State  considered  that  the
    respondent had intended to deceive one or the other department and that
    her conduct in that regard  rendered  it  undesirable  for  her  to  be
    granted ILR.  That general ground of refusal, under paragraph 322(5) of
    the Immigration Rules, mandated the refusal of  the  application  under
    paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules.  These grounds of refusal gave
    rise to what was described by the Court of Appeal in Balajigari  [2019]
    EWCA Civ 673; [2019] 1 WLR 4647 as an 'earnings discrepancy case'.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 4. The respondent appealed against the decision of 12 January  2019.   Her
    appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Marisa Cohen,  sitting  at
    Hatton Cross, on 15 July 2019.  The respondent was  represented  by  Ms
    Mosaku.  The  Secretary  of  State  was  represented  by  a  Presenting
    Officer.  The  judge  heard  evidence  from  the  respondent  and  four
    additional witnesses: the respondent's husband, her two  sisters-in-law
    and her  pastor.   She  received  detailed  submissions  from  the  two
    representatives, after which she reserved her decision on the appeal.

 5. The judge's decision is  lengthy  and  detailed.   She  summarised  the
    decision under appeal at [8]-[11].  She  directed  herself  as  to  the
    burden and standard of proof at [12]-[13].  She set out the evidence at
    [14]-[30] and the submissions made by  both  representatives  at  [31]-
    [38].  At [39]-[40], the judge made reference to the salient  parts  of
    the Immigration Rules  and  then,  at  [41]-[44],  she  made  extensive
    reference to authority, including Balajigari and R (Khan) v SSHD [2018]
    UKUT 384 (IAC); [2019] Imm AR 239.

 6. At [45]-[54], the judge set out her conclusions on the central question
    in the appeal, of whether or not the respondent had employed  deception
    in her dealings with the Home Office or HMRC.  The judge noted that the
    respondent had completed her own tax returns in the years 2010/2011 and
    2012/2013.  At [47], she recalled the size of the discrepancies between
    the sums disclosed to the two departments:

         "As rightly pointed out by the Respondent and  Mr  Terrell  on  his
         behalf, the errors are striking.  The Appellant's profit  from  her
         self-employment for the year 2010-2011 was  initially  said  to  be
         �1638.00 with profit from all employment said to be  �20,235.   The
         total income tax due was �328.60.  The figure for  the  Appellant's
         self-employment was later corrected to  �15,378.00  which  together
         with the profit from all employment  led  to  a  total  income  tax
         figure plus Class 4 NI insurance contributions of �3,3849.64.   For
         the year  2012-2013  the  Appellant's  self-employment  income  was
         initially said to be �93.00 which together  with  the  profit  from
         employment of �20,442.00 led to total  income  tax  due  of  �19.00
         whereas in 2012-2013 the self-employment was said to be  �16,373.00
         together with profit from employment of �20,442 led to a figure  of
         �4,045.12 for income tax and Class 4 NI insurance contributions."

 7. Rejecting a submission made by Ms Mosaku on behalf of  the  respondent,
    the judge  concluded  that  there  had  been  adequate  notice  of  the
    Secretary of State's concerns:  [48]-[49].   At  [50],  she  noted  the
    explanations provided for these discrepancies.  In respect of the first
    year, the respondent had not noticed that there was a  misstatement  in
    the figures and did not expect them to be inaccurate.   In  respect  of
    the second year, she had a great deal going on at the time, including a
    new house in June 2013 and her first baby  in  October  2013.  She  had
    barely filed the tax return on time and had not noticed  the  error  at
    the time.  She had noticed the errors subsequently, in 2015,  when  she
    came to check the paperwork.  She had written to HMRC in  October  2015
    in order to correct the errors and she  had  paid  the  tax  due.   The
    critical paragraph in  the  judge's  decision  is  [51],  which  it  is
    necessary to set out in full:

         "The Appellant's oral  evidence  in  relation  to  the  errors  was
         consistent with the matters set out in her witness statements.  The
         Appellant's  oral  evidence  came  across  as  straightforward  and
         without embellishment.  Significantly, I did not find  evidence  of
         exaggeration in relation to the Appellant's  circumstances  at  the
         time of submitting the tax returns in the face of significant cross-
         examination.  Her case is relatively simple -  in  respect  of  the
         2010-2011 tax return she input the wrong figures online and  simply
         did not realise that they were incorrect.  In relation to 2012-2013
         she had so much going on at the time, including caring for a three-
         month old baby and was not in a position to appreciate  the  errors
         she made at the time of a tax submission made  very  close  to  the
         deadline.  Together with these circumstances, I have to  weigh  the
         striking nature of the errors; the sheer difference in the  figures
         inputted.  Balancing the evidence  as  a  whole,  I  find  it  more
         probable  than  not  that  the  errors  were  the  consequence   of
         carelessness, as opposed to deliberate or dishonest conduct on  the
         Appellant's part.  Mr Terrell submitted powerfully that even if the
         Appellant's explanation could be accepted in relation to 2010-2011,
         by 2012-2013  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  she  would  have
         realised the errors given the relatively very  low  figure  of  tax
         due.  However, it was the 2012-2013 period when the Appellant had a
         new baby and other upheaval in her life.  Had it been the other way
         around, I may have found against the Appellant.   However,  in  all
         the circumstances, I accept that the figures  initially  attributed
         to the tax returns were mere input errors and were not the  product
         of dishonesty or deception."

 8. At [52], the judge rejected the Secretary of State's  alternative  case
    that the self-employment was not genuine; she  found  the  evidence  in
    relation to the nature of the self-employment to be consistent and  the
    oral evidence as to the way in which the  errors  were  discovered  was
    compelling.  The  respondent  would  have  had  to  submit  significant
    evidence to the Secretary of State in support  of  her  self-employment
    and the respondent had  given  oral  evidence  that  she  had  provided
    invoices at the time.  In reaching the conclusion that there  had  been
    only carelessness or mistake on the part of the respondent, as  opposed
    to dishonesty or deception, the judge made clear that she had not taken
    into account the respondent's subsequent conduct,  since  she  did  not
    consider that relevant to her behaviour at the time she filed  the  tax
    returns: [53].

 9. At [55], the judge stated that the appeal fell to  be  allowed  because
    the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  had  been  met.   In  the
    remaining paragraphs of the decision, she explained how she would  have
    reached the same conclusion in any event, applying a traditional Razgar
    [2004] 2 AC 368 analysis.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

10. The respondent sought permission to appeal  from  the  FtT,  contending
    that the judge had  failed  to  give  adequate  reasons  and  that  the
    conclusion at [51] was irrational.  That error was  said  to  undermine
    the Article 8 ECHR analysis as  a  whole.   First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Saffer refused permission on  the  basis  that  the  grounds  expressed
    nothing more than a disagreement with the judge's analysis.

11. The respondent renewed her application for permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal. The  original  grounds  of  appeal  were  relied  upon,
    although  the  emphasis  was  altered.   It  was  emphasised  that  the
    complaint was a rationality challenge advanced on two bases.   Firstly,
    it was irrational for the Tribunal to have accepted that the respondent
    could have declared less  than  2%  of  her  taxable  earnings  without
    realising the  mistake  and,  secondly,  the  judge's  approach  raised
    concerns about 'just how low the level of plausibility  has  to  be  to
    meet the standard of proof'.

12. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Sheridan,  who
    noted that it was

         "arguably irrational;/not open to the  judge  to  accept  that  the
         appellant had made  an  honest  mistake  given  the  scale  of  the
         discrepancy between her actual income and the income declared, that
         she had significantly understated her income on  two  separate  tax
         returns and that the  appellant's  explanation,  arguably  did  not
         provide a plausible explanation for how such mistakes  occurred  on
         two occasions."

13. Before me, Mr Jarvis adopted the grounds of appeal and  submitted  that
    the judge's conclusion had been irrational, inadequately  reasoned  and
    gave rise to concerns over the  standard  of  proof  she  had  actually
    applied.  He accepted that it was for the judge to  find  the  relevant
    facts  and  that  the  Upper  Tribunal  would  be   circumspect   about
    interfering with her analysis.  That was particularly so when there was
    ample self-direction on the part of the judge, all of  which  suggested
    that she had approached  her  task  correctly.    It  was  relevant  to
    recall, however, that  there  were  two  very  serious  errors  in  the
    respondent's tax returns and that she had  personally  completed  those
    returns online.  The judge had failed to give adequate reasons for  her
    conclusion that the respondent had  been  able  to  make  such  serious
    errors in two years and for her acceptance of the  account  that  these
    problems had only been discovered  by  the  respondent  in  2015.   The
    reasons given in [51] of the judge's decision did not actually  provide
    an adequate explanation for the scale of the errors.

14. Ms Mosaku responded at some length,  robustly  defending  the  decision
    reached by the judge.  She adopted her skeleton  and  reminded  me,  in
    particular, of the hesitance  with  which  an  appellate  court  should
    interfere with a factual conclusion reached by a  specialist  Tribunal.
    There was extensive  evidence  before  the  judge,  in  both  oral  and
    documentary form, and, having assessed that evidence with  great  care,
    the judge had concluded that the respondent had not intended to deceive
    the Home Office or HMRC in the period in question.  The respondent  had
    been thoroughly cross-examined, as had the  additional  witnesses,  and
    the judge's findings had been open to her.  It was relevant to  recall,
    as had the judge, that the respondent's income from self-employment was
    one part of her income; she was also employed at the material times and
    the tax from her employment had been paid by PAYE.  Also  relevant  was
    the fact that HMRC had not  imposed  a  penalty  in  2015.   The  judge
    clearly took account of the way  in  which  the  respondent  had  given
    evidence, as well as the factual content of that evidence.   The  judge
    was plainly aware  of  the  applicable  legal  principles  as  she  had
    directed  herself  meticulously.   The  Secretary  of  State's   appeal
    amounted,  in  truth,  to  nothing  more  than  a   disagreement   with
    conclusions lawfully reached  by  the  judge.   In  the  event  that  a
    material error of law was found, the correct relief was for there to be
    a de novo hearing before another judge in the FtT.

15. Mr Jarvis did not wish to respond.

16. I reserved my decision on the question of whether there was an error of
    law in the decision of the FtT and whether, if so, the  correct  course
    was as suggested by Ms Mosaku.

Analysis

17. In considering the Secretary of  State's  appeal  against  the  judge's
    decision, I bear firmly in mind the principles  which  Ms  Mosaku  very
    properly relied upon in  her  cogent  submissions.   In  particular,  I
    recall what was said by Lady Hale at [30] of AH (Sudan) [2007] UKHL 49;
    [2008] 1 AC 678:

         "This is an expert tribunal charged with  administering  a  complex
         area of law in challenging circumstances. To paraphrase  a  view  I
         have expressed about such expert tribunals in another context,  the
         ordinary  courts  should  approach  appeals  from  them   with   an
         appropriate degree of caution; it is probable that in understanding
         and applying the law in their specialised field the  tribunal  will
         have got it right: see  Cooke  v  Secretary  of  State  for  Social
         Security [2001] EWCA Civ 734, [2002] 3 All ER 279,  para  16.  They
         and they alone are the judges of the facts. It is not  enough  that
         their decision on those facts may seem harsh to people who have not
         heard and read the evidence and arguments which they have heard and
         read. Their decisions should be respected unless it is quite  clear
         that they have misdirected  themselves  in  law.  Appellate  courts
         should not rush to find  such  misdirections  simply  because  they
         might have reached a different conclusion on the facts or expressed
         themselves differently."

18. The importance of those principles has been  underscored  regularly  by
    the Court of Appeal, most recently by Floyd LJ (with  whom  Coulson  LJ
    agreed) in UT (Sri Lanka)  [2019]  EWCA  Civ  1095.   At  [19]  of  his
    judgment, Floyd LJ cited what was said by Lady Hale in AH (Sudan).   He
    went on, at [26], to recall what had  been  said  by  Lord  Hope  in  R
    (Jones) v FtT and CICA [2013] UKSC 19, regarding the judicial restraint
    which must be exercised when considering the reasons given by  a  first
    instance tribunal.  Lord Hope stated that "the appellate  court  should
    not assume too  readily  that  the  tribunal  misdirected  itself  just
    because not every step in its reasoning  is  fully  set  out  in  it.".
    Floyd LJ also cited what had been said by Lord Lane CJ at p794 of  R  v
    IAT ex parte Khan [1983] QB 790, that a Tribunal's reasoning  might  be
    either expressly stated or inferentially stated.

19. Similar dicta appear regularly in decisions of the Court of  Appeal  in
    other contexts.  In Mackenzie v  Alcoa  Manufacturing  [2019]  EWA  Civ
    2110, for example, Garnham J was held to have erred in his decision  to
    interfere with the findings reached by the trial judge, HJJ Vosper  QC,
    in a trial for damages for personal injury  for  noise-induced  hearing
    loss.  At [54], Dingemans LJ (with whom  Baker  and  Bean  LJJ  agreed)
    adopted the language of Lewison LJ in Fage v Chobani [2014] EWCA Civ  5
    when he said this:

         "It is established that appellate courts should be very cautious in
         overturning findings of fact made by a first instance judge.   This
         is because first instance judges have seen witnesses and take  into
         account the whole "sea" of the evidence, rather  than  indulged  in
         impermissible "island hopping" to parts only of the  evidence,  and
         because  duplication  of  effort  on  appeal  is  undesirable   and
         increases costs and delay.  Judges hearing appeals on facts  should
         only interfere if a finding of fact was made which had no basis  in
         the evidence, or where there was a demonstrable misunderstanding of
         relevant evidence, or a demonstrable failure to  consider  relevant
         evidence so that the decision could not reasonably be explained  or
         justified."

20. With those dicta in mind, I reject the Secretary of State's  submission
    that the judge applied the wrong standard of proof.   The  standard  of
    proof was correctly stated by her and there is  nothing  whatsoever  in
    the decision to suggest that she departed from  that  standard  in  her
    assessment.   There  is  reference  not  only   to   the   balance   of
    probabilities but also to the judge considering  whether  an  assertion
    made  is  more  likely  than  not.   In  fairness  to  Mr  Jarvis,   he
    acknowledged the difficulty he faced in making this  submission,  which
    rather withered on the vine.

21. Nor do I accept the principal  submission  made  by  the  Secretary  of
    State, which is  that  the  judge's  decision  was  irrational  in  the
    Wednesbury sense.  It is obviously highly unlikely that  a  person  who
    earns in the region of �1300 per month from self-employment  could  err
    so fundamentally on their tax return that they innocently declared only
    �93 from self-employment for the entire  year.   As  long  as  adequate
    reasons were provided for accepting that account, however,  I  consider
    that it would be open to a judge to accept that such a 'striking' error
    was indeed an innocent one.   The  real  question  in  this  appeal  is
    whether the reasons provided by the judge were actually adequate.

22. In considering that question, the litmus test is  whether  the  reasons
    were given in sufficient detail to demonstrate the basis upon which the
    judge acted and the reasons that led her to her decision.  The  reasons
    need not be elaborate  or  lengthy  and  appellate  bodies  must  guard
    against complaints based on an alleged insufficiency of  reasons  which
    are, in truth, simply a disagreement with the outcome: R (Iran) v  SSHD
    [2005] INLR 535.  Ms Mosaku submitted powerfully  before  me  that  the
    reasons provided by the judge were adequate. She reminded me  that  the
    judge had heard from the respondent, her family members and her  pastor
    and submitted that the judge had given adequate reasons for concluding,
    when confronted with  that  sea  of  evidence,  that  the  respondent's
    conduct had not been dishonest.

23. Notwithstanding Ms Mosaku's powerful submissions, I have  come  to  the
    clear  conclusion  that  the  judge's  decision  does  not,  even  when
    considered as a whole, provide adequate reasons for her conclusion that
    the respondent's conduct was not dishonest.  The critical part  of  the
    judge's decision is [51], which I have reproduced in  full  above.   In
    respect of the 2010/2011 tax year, the judge gave no  adequate  reasons
    for concluding that the respondent  had  personally  entered  incorrect
    figures.  She simply concluded that the  respondent  had  not  realised
    that the figures were incorrect.   Had  the  figure  in  question  been
    marginally wrong, or even if there had been  a  decimal  point  in  the
    wrong place, I might  have  considered  there  to  be  an  adequacy  of
    reasons.  But in the 2010/2011 tax year, the respondent  declared  only
    �1638 by way of self-employed  income  to  HMRC,  whereas  she  claimed
    �15378 of self-employed income in her application to the respondent.

24. It does  not  suffice,  in  my  judgment,  merely  to  state  that  the
    respondent had not appreciated that there was  an  error.   She  is  an
    educated woman who was  completing  the  return  online  herself.   The
    completion of a tax return online requires an  individual  to  complete
    separate sections for employment  and  self-employment  and  there  are
    regular requirements to verify the information previously entered.   At
    the end of the process, prior to submission, there is a formal  warning
    that  false  information  might  lead   to   financial   penalties   or
    prosecution.  Given these safeguards, it is not at all clear  from  the
    judge's decision how the respondent came to submit a  tax  return  with
    such a serious error.  In all the circumstances, I  consider  that  the
    judge's reasons for concluding that the  respondent  made  an  innocent
    error in respect of the 2010/2011 tax  year  were  legally  inadequate.
    Even when the detailed decision is considered as a whole, the Secretary
    of State is unable to discern how the respondent came to make  such  an
    innocent mistake.

25. In respect of the 2012/2013  tax  year,  I  recognise  that  the  judge
    provided more reasoning.  The discrepancy in this period was even  more
    striking, as the judge noted.  The respondent declared �93 to  HMRC  in
    self-employed earnings, whereas she relied on self-employed earnings of
    �16373 in her application for further leave to remain.  The  respondent
    attributed these errors to having a new baby and a new  house,  and  to
    completing the tax return very close to  the  deadline.   Having  taken
    into account the evidence as a whole, including the manner in which the
    respondent had given her own evidence, the judge was prepared to accept
    this explanation.  Again, however, I come to the clear conclusion  that
    the judge omitted a step in her process of reasoning.

26. The judge explained the respondent's circumstances at the time that she
    personally completed the tax return but she failed to  consider  or  to
    explain how those circumstances came to explain the egregious error  in
    the figure presented.  As I observed to Ms Mosaku at the hearing, there
    is nothing  in  the  judge's  decision  which  enables  the  reader  to
    understand why it was that the respondent, a woman  who  was  receiving
    close to �1400 per month from self-employment, declaring  only  �93  of
    that income to the Revenue for the entire tax year.  Having a new baby,
    a new house and a degree  of  time  pressure  does  not  begin,  in  my
    judgment, to explain how an error of that magnitude came to be made  in
    the first place, or how the tax return came  to  be  submitted  by  the
    respondent.  In order to submit the return, the respondent  would  have
    been asked to confirm that sum more  than  once  and  would  have  been
    warned about the consequences of a false declaration.  In the  face  of
    those safeguards, it is by no means clear from the judge's decision how
    the respondent's circumstances resulted in the erroneous declaration.

27. Ms Mosaku submitted that  the  Tribunal  would  require  a  counsel  of
    perfection if it found for the Secretary of State on  this  basis,  and
    that Mr Jarvis merely sought 'reasons for reasons' but I do not  agree.
    The judge was required to set out with sufficient clarity  the  reasons
    why these serious errors came to be made.  In respect of the  2010/2011
    return, she clearly failed to do  so.   In  respect  of  the  2012/2013
    return, she failed to  explain  anything  more  than  the  respondent's
    circumstances at the time, and she failed  to  state  her  reasons  for
    accepting that those circumstances led an educated woman to  declare  a
    self-employed income which was so drastically lower than the income she
    relied upon in a different context.

28. In the circumstances, I accept the Secretary of State's submission that
    the decision is vitiated by legal error and that it cannot stand.   The
    conclusions reached at [55] were determinative of the appeal,  and  the
    Article 8 ECHR analysis  which  followed  was  not  undertaken  in  the
    alternative.  Ms Mosaku submitted that the appropriate relief,  were  I
    to reach that conclusion, was for the appeal  to  be  remitted  to  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  for  re-hearing  afresh.   Mr  Jarvis   made   no
    submissions on relief.  Since it would not be appropriate  for  any  of
    the judge's findings to be preserved, I accept that  remission  to  the
    FtT is the proper course.  For the avoidance  of  doubt,  that  hearing
    will be de novo before any judge of the FtT other  than  Judge  Marissa
    Cohen.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal was  vitiated  by  legal  error  and
cannot stand.  The appeal will be remitted to the FtT for  a  fresh  hearing
