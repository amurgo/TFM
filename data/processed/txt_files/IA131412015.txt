For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R Singer, Counsel, instructed by Wellers Law
Group


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The respondent (hereafter the claimant) is  a  citizen  of  India.  She
    first came to the  UK in  May  2010  as  a  visitor.  Subsequently  she
    obtained entry clearance as a fianc�e. This was granted in  March 2011.
     On 3 June 2011 the claimant's fianc�, Mr Bonthron, sadly passed  away.
    On 8 September 2011  she  applied  for  leave  to  remain  outside  the
    Immigration Rules. The SSHD granted a short period of leave  until  May
    2012 to allow her to recover from her sponsor's death and complete  her
    affairs.  After returning to India the  claimant  applied  successfully
    for a Tier 4 (General) Student  visa  and  commenced  her  Finance  and
    Management MSc degree on 10 November  2014.  On  22  January  2015  she
    applied for leave to remain on Article 8 grounds.

2.   On 18  March  the  appellant  (hereafter  the  SSHD)  made  a  decision
    refusing to vary leave to remain and giving directions for removal. She
    appealed.  In a decision sent on  14  March  2016  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge (FtT) Judge Pears allowed  her  appeal  on  the  basis  that  the
    decision was not in accordance with the law.  The basis for  the  judge
    allowing the appeal was that he accepted the submissions of Counsel for
    the claimant that the SSHD had failed to consider whether the  claimant
    had suffered an historic injustice by not  being  advised  in  2011  to
    apply for ILR.  Those submissions had  argued  that  the  Secretary  of
    State had enacted a specific immigration  rule  for  ILR  for  bereaved
    spouses namely para 287(6) which provided:

         "287(b) The requirements for indefinite leave  to  remain  for  the
         bereaved spouse or civil partner of a person who  was  present  and
         settled in the United Kingdom are that:


         (i)(a) the applicant was admitted  to  the  United  Kingdom  for  a
         period of not exceeding 27 months or given an extension of stay for
         a period of 2 years as the spouse or  civil  partner  of  a  person
         present and settled in the United Kingdom in accordance  paragraphs
         281 and 286 of these Rules; or


         ---(b) the applicant was admitted  to  the  United  Kingdom  for  a
         period not exceeding 27 months or given an extension of stay for  a
         period of 2 years as the unmarried or same-sex partner of a  person
         present and settled  in  the  United  Kingdom  in  accordance  with
         paragraphs 195AA to 295F of these  Rules  and  during  that  period
         married or formed a civil partnership with the person  whom  he  or
         she was admitted or granted an extension of stay to join; and


         (ii) the person whom the  applicant  was  admitted  or  granted  an
         extension of stay to join died during that period; and


         (iii) the applicant was still the spouse or civil  partner  of  the
         person he or she was admitted or granted an extension  of  stay  to
         join at the time of the death; and


         (iv) each of the parties intended  to  live  permanently  with  the
         other as his or her spouse or civil partner  and  the  marriage  or
         civil partnership was subsisting at the time of the death; or


         (v) the applicant does not have one or m  ore  unspent  convictions
         within the meaning of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974."

3.   The SSHD's grounds submitted that the judge  was  wrong  to  allow  the
    appeal on the above basis because the aforesaid rule  was  confined  to
    bereaved spouses who had been admitted to  the  UK  for  a  period  not
    exceeding 27 months or given an extension of stay for a period  of  two
    years "as the spouse .... of a person present and  settled  in  the  UK
    ...".  The claimant had been admitted as a fianc�e,  not  as  a  spouse
    (para 287(6)). The SSHD's grounds also failed to give  reasons  "as  to
    whether there were any exceptional circumstances in order to   consider
    Article 8 outside of the Rules".

4.   I am grateful to both parties for their submissions.

5.   I have no hesitation in finding that  the  judge  materially  erred  in
    law. Whether through oversight or  some  other  reason  the  judge  was
    simply wrong to consider that the claimant had a  potential  basis  for
    being granted ILR under the Rules in force in November 2011.  The  SSHD
    is entirely right in pointing out that the old Rules only provided  for
    a grant of ILR to bereaved spouses,  not  bereaved  fianc�(e)s.   There
    being no "historic" rule under which the  claimant  stood  to  benefit,
    there could not have been an  "historic  injustice"  arising  from  the
    failure of the SSHD to consider the  claimant  under  it.  The  judge's
    decision cannot be construed as an allowance under Article 8 because he
    expressly stated that it would "not be appropriate to decide  the  case
    finally and consider the [claimant's] rights under Article  8"  and  "I
    make no decision in relation to Article 8" ([21]).

6.   Mr Singer sought at one  point  to  argue  that  the  judge's  "not  in
    accordance with the law" decision was still justified even though there
    was in fact no immigration rule because the SSHD could   have   granted
    ILR on a discretionary  basis.  However even assuming the  SSHD  had  a
    policy at the time making it possible to grant ILR (Mr Singer  did  not
    provide chapter and verse), it is  clear  that  she  did  exercise  her
    discretion by way of making a grant of DLR and  the  claimant  did  not
    seek to challenge that - and indeed decided to leave the UK  to  return
    to India.  Hence there cannot be  said  to  be  any  kind  of  historic
    injustice in the SSHD's treatment of the claimant's case.

7.   Accordingly I find that the FtT judge materially erred in law  and  her
    decision is set aside.

8.   Both the  representatives  urged  that  if  I  set  aside  the  judge's
    decision I should remit it  to  the  FtT  to  consider  the  claimant's
    Article 8 grounds of appeal.  I am in agreement  with  them  that  this
    would be the fairest course as the  claimant  has  effectively  had  no
    assessment of her Article 8 grounds of  appeal.   Mr  Singer  said  the
    claimant would want to give evidence and call witnesses.  I am not sure
    that is necessary, since it would appear that there  is  little  or  no
    dispute as regards the facts of the claimant's case.  However, I direct
    that  the  claimant's  representatives  produce   witness   statements,
    presumably updated from before, from the claimant and any other persons
    whose evidence she intends to rely on in her appeal, at  least  7  days
    before the date fixed for the next hearing which will be a CMR, so that
    the new FtT judge can decide whether in any oral evidence is necessary.



No anonymity direction is made.
