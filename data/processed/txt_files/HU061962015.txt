Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Although the Appellant is the Secretary of State I refer to the parties
    as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Appellant, a Filipino national, appealed to the First-tier Tribunal
    against a decision of the Secretary of State dated 15th September  2015
    to refuse his application for leave to  remain  on  the  basis  of  his
    private and family life in the UK. In a decision  promulgated  on  13th
    February  2017  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  M  R  Oliver  allowed  the
    Appellant's appeal.  The Secretary of State appeals  to  this  Tribunal
    with permission granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  McGinty  on  16th
    August 2017.

 3. The background to this appeal is that the Appellant entered the  UK  on
    10th March 2008 with a student visa valid until 31st August 2009.   His
    further application for leave to remain as a student was granted  until
    30th July 2012.  He made an application for  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    application which was withdrawn in June 2013 and on 13th  January  2013
    he made an application for leave  to  remain  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules which was refused on 12th June 2013 with no right of appeal.   In
    July 2013 and March 2014 he made  applications  for  a  residence  card
    under the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations.   These  applications  were
    refused in February and May  2014.   On  21st  July  2015  he  made  an
    application for leave to remain on the grounds of  private  and  family
    life.  The basis of that application was that the Appellant was a carer
    for Mrs Benjamin. The Secretary of State refused  that  application  on
    15th September 2015.  At the time  of  the  appeal  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal the Appellant's situation had changed Mrs Benjamin had died on
    26th June 2016. The Appellant's case  was  that  after  Mrs  Benjamin's
    death he  undertook  caring  duties  for  Mrs  Benjamin's  brother,  Mr
    Garfield, and his wife.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge decided that the
    Appellant could not meet the requirements of paragraph  276ADE  of  the
    Immigration Rules, however the judge considered the appeal in terms  of
    Article 8 and allowed the appeal on human rights grounds.

 4. In the Grounds of Appeal the Secretary  of  State  contended  that  the
    judge erred in law in failing to properly assess Article 8 in  that  he
    failed to follow the steps set out in R v SSHD ex parte  Razgar  [2004]
    UKHL 27.  It is contended that the judge failed to make any findings in
    relation to the nature, if any, of the Appellant's private life in  the
    UK.  It is further  contended  that  the  judge  failed  to  adequately
    consider the state's responsibility to provide care to  the  Garfields.
    It is contended that the judge failed to adequately consider and  weigh
    the fact that the Appellant is an overstayer and failed  to  adequately
    consider public interest. It is therefore contended  that  the  judge's
    consideration  of  the  proportionality  element  of  the   Article   8
    assessment is lacking.

 5. In granting permission to  appeal  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  McGinty
    considered  it  arguable  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge   has
    materially erred in his approach to Article 8 and has failed to  follow
    the five stage approach set out in Razgar.  It  is  further  considered
    arguable as a Robinson obvious point that the judge had not  adequately
    explained how there can be family life between the Appellant and Mr and
    Mrs Garfield.  It was also considered arguable that the judge  had  not
    considered Section 117A to D of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
    Act 2002.

 6. At the time of the hearing before  me  the  circumstances  had  further
    changed in that Mr Garfield died in January 2017.

 7. In his submissions Mr Bramble contended that the judge's  consideration
    of Article 8 in paragraph 12  of  the  decision  is  insufficient.   He
    submitted that the focus in the assessment was upon the Garfield family
    rather than upon the Appellant and that the  judge  had  undertaken  no
    analysis of the relationship between the Appellant and the person he is
    caring for. He submitted that the judge had failed to assess the impact
    on the public purse and failed to assess whether the family  could  pay
    for any care required.  He  submitted  that  the  judge's  findings  at
    paragraph 9 show that, as the Appellant is being paid less than  agency
    care, he provides cheap labour in comparison.  In  his  submission  the
    judge had engaged in speculation as to the cost to the public purse  of
    providing alternative care to the Garfields.   In  his  submission  the
    judge had not set out all of the competing factors at paragraph 12.

 8. In her submissions Ms Beach  relied  on  the  Rule  24  response.   She
    submitted that the judge set out the evidence before him at  paragraphs
    8, 9 and 10 and it was clear from the analysis there and  at  paragraph
    12 that the judge was  aware  that  the  Appellant's  status  had  been
    initially precarious and latterly unlawful.   It  was  clear  that  the
    judge had this in mind in his assessment.  She referred to the evidence
    before the judge as to the relationship between the Appellant  and  the
    family and submitted that the evidence showed that this was  more  than
    an employment relationship as the Appellant is viewed as  a  member  of
    the family.  She submitted that the Appellant had therefore established
    some form of private life in the UK.  She submitted that the judge  had
    taken into account the evidence in relation to  Mrs  Garfield  and  her
    difficulties in coping with caring for her husband.  In  terms  of  the
    evidence of the cost to the public  purse  Ms  Beach  referred  to  the
    Appellant's bundle where at page  146  there  is  a  reference  to  the
    Garfields' savings being over the threshold but that they would run out
    as care is very expensive.  She referred to page 123 of the Appellant's
    bundle where there is a statement from  Mr  and  Mrs  Garfield's  three
    children which states that it would not be financially viable to employ
    a full-time agency carer due to the enormous agency costs  which  would
    not be sustainable.  In terms of the Appellant's pay  she  referred  to
    page 22 (the application for leave to remain)  which  showed  that  the
    Appellant was being paid �1,700 per month as  well  as  being  provided
    with rent-free accommodation at the employers' house.

Error of Law

 9. As acknowledged by both parties the judge's assessment of Article 8  is
    contained in paragraph 12 of the decision.  The judge's conclusion that
    the Appellant cannot bring himself within paragraph 276ADE of the Rules
    as he has skills which he can utilise upon return to his family and  he
    has not lost ties with the Philippines was not disputed.  The judge did
    take into account that the Appellant's immigration status "has been  at
    best precarious, but recently unlawful". The judge went on to  consider
    the appeal outside of the Rules because "the circumstances of the  care
    arrangements are such that the sheer practicality  of  the  comparative
    arrangements warrants consideration of article 8 outside the rules".

10. The judge's proportionality assessment is carried out in the  following
    passage in paragraph 12:-

         "Although the Appellant's immigration history deserves  no  reward,
         the public interest in upholding the importance of  fair  but  firm
         immigration control has to be balanced against the very significant
         saving to the public purse in keeping Mrs Garfield well  enough  to
         remain at home and to avoid the high cost to the  public  purse  in
         providing care to both her and Mr Garfield, especially at this time
         when  resources  are  critically  stretched.   In  coming  to   the
         judgement that the Appellant's removal would in these circumstances
         be disproportionate I have taken into consideration the quality  of
         the care as well as its quantity and  that  it  is  provided  to  2
         British citizens who have, I assume, lived not only long  but  also
         uncriticised lives, paying taxes and observing their civic duties".

11. It is  apparent  to  me  from  reading  this  assessment  that  a  very
    significant factor tipping the balance in favour of  the  Appellant  in
    this case is the "very significant  saving  to  the  public  purse"  in
    keeping the Garfields at home.  However, Ms Beach was unable to  direct
    me to any direct evidence in relation to the Garfields'  finances.   In
    fact the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal Judge  indicated  that
    the Garfields had resources which would provide for care for a  certain
    period of time and that the Garfields' savings were above the threshold
    for benefits, though would go  below  that  threshold  over  "the  next
    couple of years", although the Garfields' daughter said  at  that  time
    she did not know the exact amount of their  savings  (Social  Services'
    assessment of August 2016 at page 146 of the Appellant's bundle  before
    the First-tier Tribunal).  On the basis  of  the  evidence  before  the
    judge therefore, there was no basis on which  to  conclude  that  there
    would be a "high cost to the public purse" in  providing  care  to  the
    Garfields.  In fact, the evidence indicated that the  couple  did  have
    resources which may well pay for care in the absence of the  Appellant.
    In these circumstances the judge made a finding at paragraph  12  which
    was simply not based on the evidence before him.

12. It is clear from reading paragraph 12 that this was the primary  factor
    tipping the balance in favour of the Appellant.  In these circumstances
    the assessment at paragraph 12 has no basis in the evidence and  cannot
    stand.  Accordingly,  in  my  view  the  judge's  decision  contains  a
    material error of law and I set it aside.



Remaking the Decision

13. In advance of the hearing the Appellant had submitted an Upper Tribunal
    bundle containing the documents already before the First-tier  Tribunal
    and updated statements and evidence.   I  take  this  into  account  in
    remaking the decision.  I also heard oral evidence from  the  Appellant
    and from two witnesses, Mrs Garfield's daughter, Jenny Lazarus, and her
    niece,  Paulette  Jaffe.   Each  witness  confirmed  their   statements
    contained in the Appellant's bundle.

14. In his oral evidence the Appellant said that he is paid �400 a week  by
    Mrs Garfield for looking after her and he said that he had not returned
    to the  Philippines  since  coming  to  the  UK  in  2008.   In  cross-
    examination the Appellant said that he is the only one who looks  after
    Mrs Garfield, he is the main carer.  He has breaks during  the  day  if
    she is sleeping or watching television.  He also  helps  out  with  Mrs
    Garfield's son who has Multiple Sclerosis and lives about five  minutes
    walk away.  I asked the Appellant if he works seven days a week and  he
    said that he works five days a week and that the  other  two  days  Mrs
    Garfield's daughters visit her or she is at their house.  He  confirmed
    that he has no other connections in the local community or  in  the  UK
    apart from the Garfield family.

15. In her oral evidence Mrs Lazarus said that since her father's death her
    mother has suffered from anxiety, depression and is  lonely,  unsettled
    and struggling.  She described her relationship with the  Appellant  as
    "lovely".  She described him as being like a son and said that she  has
    known him for eight or nine years and that he is a wonderful  companion
    for her as well as her carer.  In cross-examination she said  that  the
    Appellant helps out with her brother if his family is away or if he  is
    having difficulties, but he said that this is not very  often  as  they
    live very close by and he sometimes helps out for a short period.   She
    said that her mother needs someone to be there  in  the  night-time  in
    case she gets up and in the morning she needs someone to encourage  her
    to get out of  bed.   She  needs  someone  to  prepare  her  meals  and
    medication and help with her shopping.  When asked if  Social  Services
    had been involved since the death of her father Mrs Lazarus  said  that
    they had replaced her mother's bathchair.  She said that the  Appellant
    had been with her aunt and uncle for seven or eight years and that  her
    parents were very close to them and would have seen the Appellant often
    in their company.

16. In her oral evidence Ms Jaffe described the  relationship  between  the
    Appellant and Mrs Garfield as being very close.  She said that since Mr
    Garfield died Mrs Garfield has become more dependent on the  Appellant.
    She described him as "an angel" and says that he goes far  beyond  what
    is expected of him.  She said that he had worked  for  her  mother  for
    seven years and had been like a son to her parents.



My Findings

17. There was no  submission  that  the  Appellant  meets  requirements  of
    Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules or  any  other
    provisions of the Rules.  In these circumstances I go  on  to  consider
    the appeal under Article 8.

18. I follow the steps set out in the case of Razgar.  The first  issue  is
    whether the Appellant has established private or family life in the UK.
     Mr Bramble accepted that the Appellant has developed private  life  as
    he has been in the UK  since  2008.   In  his  view  any  private  life
    established is narrow and limited as the Appellant has  at  this  point
    been a carer for the Garfield family since July 2016 and only  for  Mrs
    Garfield since the death of Mr Garfield  in  January  2017.   Ms  Beach
    submitted that there is a qualifying family  relationship  between  the
    Appellant and the  wider  Garfield  family  members  and  that  he  has
    developed a real relationship with all of them.   She  did  not  submit
    that he had established family life with  them.  The  Appellant  is  an
    adult who is paid to look after Mrs Garfield, having previously  looked
    after her husband and before  that  his  sister.  The  relationship  is
    essentially one  of  employee  and  employer.  The  evidence  does  not
    establish that this relationship amounts to family life.

19. I accept on the basis of the evidence that the Appellant has  developed
    a private life in the United Kingdom.  Given that he has not  developed
    any connections in the UK outside of the Garfield family,  his  private
    life is one based on his ties with that family  only.   In  considering
    the nature and extent of the private life  I  note  that  he  has  been
    living with Mrs Garfield since July 2016.   I  take  into  account  the
    nature of the duties undertaken by the Appellant for  Mrs  Garfield  as
    set out in Mrs Lazarus's statement  and  in  their  oral  evidence.   I
    accept that the Appellant prepares meals, administers medication, takes
    her out for walks, takes her to the doctor, helps her with bathing  and
    general household duties and with shopping and that he  encourages  her
    to get up in the mornings.  I accept that he is a  companion  for  her.
    The Appellant appears to have a good relationship with the wider family
    members.  I accept that he has developed a private life on this  basis.



20. If he were to be removed from the UK I accept that  his  removal  would
    interfere with the private  life  he  has  developed  with  the  family
    members and with the private life of those family members.  As accepted
    by Ms Beach the decision is in accordance with  the  law  in  that  the
    Appellant cannot meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

21. The issue therefore is whether the decision to refuse  the  Appellant's
    application  for  leave  to  remain   is   justified,   necessary   and
    proportionate.  I take account of paragraph 117B  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The Appellant gave oral  evidence  to
    me in English and I accept that he speaks English.   The  Appellant  is
    financially independent because of his employment  with  Mrs  Garfield.
    The Appellant's private life with Mrs Garfield's in-laws  and  extended
    family began at a time when he had  limited  leave  and  therefore  his
    immigration status was  precarious.   Mr  Bramble  submitted  that  the
    Appellant has had no leave to remain since 12th June 2013.  It may well
    be from his immigration history that he has  had  no  leave  to  remain
    since July 2012 as I note that, despite making applications, he was not
    granted any leave to remain after that date.  In any event he  has  had
    no leave to remain since at the latest June 2013, therefore his private
    life with Mr and Mrs Garfield was established while he was  in  the  UK
    unlawfully.  I accept that little weight does not mean no weight but  I
    attach little weight to the Appellant's private life in  light  of  his
    precarious then unlawful status.

22. I take into account the evidence in relation to Mrs Garfield.   I  note
    the letter from her GP of 26th October 2017 where the GP says  "I  have
    been asked by the family to  write  a  short  summary  of  her  medical
    history which necessitates a carer full time".  The  GP  said  that  he
    wholeheartedly supported the carer remaining in place and said it would
    be "extremely unhelpful for her to have to find another carer".  The GP
    details Mrs Garfield's history of type 2 diabetes, degenerative changes
    in her lower back and a pacemaker having been fitted for  an  AV  heart
    block.  He also says that she suffers with significant anxiety  and  is
    under the care of a psychiatrist.  He says that a carer is required and
    that he wholeheartedly supports the continuation that it continues.   I
    also take into account the report from the Consultant Psychiatrist, the
    Medical Director of the Priory Hospital in  North  London,  dated  24th
    October 2017 which states that Mrs Garfield has been his patient  since
    July 2016 and has a history of depression and anxiety which started  in
    2012.  It also says that she has severe arthritis and can be in  a  lot
    of pain and her mobility is severely limited.  She was admitted to  The
    Priory Hospital with severe depressive illness  in  July  2016  and  is
    taking anti-depressant medication. The psychiatrist refers to the  fact
    that the Appellant is a full-time live-in carer and says:-

         "If Mr Ulancga were not there  to  look  after  Mrs  Garfield,  her
         health would deteriorate, she would  become  more  depressed,  more
         anxious and she would require hospital admission.   The  care  that
         Mrs Garfield gets from Mr Ulancga contains her depression and keeps
         her out of hospital".

23. I take into account the Appellant's evidence as set out in a  statement
    that he is a companion for Mrs Garfield and that she benefits from  his
    presence.   I  take  into  account  the  evidence  about   the   health
    difficulties of Mrs Garfield's son and the fact that her two  daughters
    "both visit their mother occasionally" (paragraph 10 of the Appellant's
    statement).  I take into account also  the  letter  from  Mrs  Garfield
    herself dated 17th October 2017.  She says that she is 80 years old and
    talks about her health problems and  the  medication  she  takes.   She
    talks about her depression and the fact that the Appellant has  been  a
    big help to her and that she is close to him.   She  describes  how  he
    helped her after the death of her husband.  She sets  out  his  duties.
    She too says that if were not for the Appellant her health  would  have
    deteriorated and in particular her depression. It is  clear  from  this
    evidence that Mrs Garfield benefits from a companion and carer. However
    there is nothing in the evidence to indicate that this care  cannot  be
    provided by someone else.

24. On the basis of the evidence  before  me  I  do  not  accept  that  Mrs
    Garfield would be reliant upon the state for support in the absence  of
    the Appellant.  There is no evidence before me as to her funds.   There
    is no evidence to indicate that she could not arrange  for  alternative
    care on a private basis, perhaps by employing another live-in carer  or
    coming to some other arrangement.  It appears from the Appellant's  own
    evidence that there are times when Mrs Garfield  does  not  need  care;
    when she is watching television or when she  is  sleeping,  and  it  is
    clear that he has time off at times during the day.  I also  note  that
    he does not work at weekends when care is provided  by  Mrs  Garfield's
    daughters.  Whilst Mrs Garfield has formed a bond  with  the  Appellant
    she could replace the care he provides and could develop  a  bond  with
    another carer employed on a similar basis.

25. Whilst it appears that Mrs Garfield has funds to employ another  carer,
    it appears that there have been no further applications for  assistance
    from Social Services. Accordingly it is not clear what,  if  any,  care
    might be provided for Mrs Garfield having carried out a proper and full
    assessment of her current needs. Whilst the family may prefer that  Mrs
    Garfield has a live-in carer, it may well be  that  such  care  is  not
    considered strictly necessary by Social Services.  Further, it  appears
    that the report from the GP supporting the care provided at the  moment
    to Mrs Garfield does not in terms say that she needs a full-time carer.
     In any event, the GP says that it would be "extremely  unhelpful"  for
    her to have to find another carer. This does not mean that it cannot be
    done or that she would not benefit from another carer.

26. I must also take into account that it  must  have  been  known  to  Mrs
    Garfield and her family at the time that the Appellant became the carer
    for the family that he did not have leave to remain in the UK. This  is
    a factor they should have taken into account in coming to  the  current
    arrangement as should the Appellant. I also take account of the  letter
    from the Psychiatrist and note the opinion that if the  Appellant  were
    not there to look after Mrs  Garfield  her  health  would  deteriorate.
    However, there is no opinion that this care must be  provided  only  by
    the  Appellant  rather  than  another  carer,  whether   full-time   or
    otherwise, and the Psychiatrist undertook no analysis as to whether the
    care provided by the Appellant could be provided by someone else.

27. Therefore in  weighing  the  public  interest  of  the  maintenance  of
    immigration control in circumstances where the Appellant has been  here
    unlawfully whilst developing the caring relationship with Mrs Garfield,
    and taking into account the fact that the care could be  provided  from
    other sources, whether  privately  or  through  Social  Services  or  a
    combination of both, in my view it is clear that public interest is not
    outweighed by the impact of the Appellant's departure upon Mrs Garfield
    and the wider Garfield family.

28. Whilst the Appellant has developed friendships with the other  Garfield
    family  members,  there  is  no  reason  why  these   friendships   and
    connections could not be continued even if he leaves the UK.

29.  In  conclusion,  in  remaking  the  decision  I  have  considered  the
    Appellant's private life under  Article  8  and  I  conclude  that  the
    decision to refuse the application is proportionate to the  Appellant's
    private life.
