Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Cole, Counsel for Westkin Associates, London
For the Respondent:    Mr Kandola, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of  Nigeria  born  on  19th  May  1985.   He
    appealed against the decision of the Respondent  dated  20th  May  2014
    refusing the Appellant leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a  Tier
    1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  His appeal was heard by Judge of the  First-
    tier Tribunal Hands on 30th October 2014.   The  appeal  was  dismissed
    under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  on  human  rights  grounds  in   a
    determination promulgated on 18th November 2014.

 2. An application for permission to appeal was lodged and  permission  was
    granted by Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Foudy  on  16th  February
    2015.  The permission states that it is arguable that the  judge  erred
    in that she made numerous factual errors that suggests she had mixed up
    the Appellant's appeal with another appeal and/or had copied  parts  of
    her determination from another person's determination.  The  permission
    states that because of these errors the judge's findings may have  been
    contaminated.

 3. There was an error of law hearing at  Field  House  on  20th  May  2015
    before me.  I issued a determination on 17th June 2015.  I  found  that
    there were material errors of law in the First-tier Tribunal's decision
    and directed a second stage hearing before the Upper  Tribunal  on  all
    issues.  None of the  findings  in  the  First-tier  determination  are
    preserved.

 4. This is the second stage hearing

The Hearing

 5. There were no preliminary matters.

 6. The Appellant took the stand and asked that his statement of 26th  June
    2015 be used as evidence for the hearing.

 7. The Presenting Officer referred to the refusal letter which states that
    a large part of the money which the Appellant will be investing,  comes
    from his father.  This amounts to �42,500  but  instead  of  the  money
    going directly to the Appellant or his company from his father  it  was
    transferred to the account of the Appellant's cousin Mohammed Abdullahi
    by a money transfer company.  The  Appellant's  evidence  is  that  his
    cousin knew people in the money transfer company and that is why it was
    transferred into his name.

 8. The Presenting Officer asked the Appellant if his father is in  Nigeria
    and he said he is.  He was  asked  why  his  father  did  not  directly
    transfer the money into the Appellant's UK bank account.  He said  that
    finance is highly regulated in Nigeria and you can only transfer �5,000
    at a time every three months from  there,  so  he  would  have  had  to
    transfer the money in bits.  He said this only applies  to  individuals
    not companies but his father does not own a company  in  Nigeria.   The
    Appellant said that his father works for Nestles.  The  Appellant  said
    he had put �7,500 with his father so his father had sent the �50,000 in
    one lump and this consisted of �7,500 belonging to  the  Appellant  and
    �42,500  belonging  to  his  father.   He  said  that  the  money   was
    transferred from his  father's  Nigerian  bank  account  to  the  money
    transfer company.  He said his father's name is Abdulrazak  Abdulsalam.
    He said his bank is the FCMB Bank.  He was asked if there  is  evidence
    of this and I was referred to the Appellant's bundle in which there  is
    a letter from the Appellant's father, "To Whom it May Concern", stating
    that he has transferred �50,000 to the Appellant into his  Lloyds  bank
    account.  The Presenting Officer asked if there is a bank statement  to
    support this letter and I was referred to page 169 of  the  Appellant's
    bundle.  On 10th January 2014 the sum of 12,024,900 NGN was  taken  out
    of the Appellant's bank account.  It is described as "CD Express  Ltd".
    The Presenting Officer said that this had not been submitted  with  his
    application and  the  Appellant  said  that  correct.   The  Presenting
    Officer stated that this is  therefore  postdecision  evidence  and  is
    inadmissible in a PBS case.  He referred to Section  85A(4)(d)  of  the
    2006 Act.  Counsel for the Appellant argued that this is  a  non-points
    based issue and that this evidence should be accepted.  The  Presenting
    Officer referred me to the case of Ahmed and Others in which this point
    was settled and submitted that  although  this  may  not  be  a  points
    scoring  issue,  in  a  PBS  case  only  evidence  submitted  with  the
    application can be considered.  The Presenting Officer  also  submitted
    that the letter from  the  Appellant's  father,  at  page  160  of  the
    Appellant's  bundle,  postdates  the  application.    The   Appellant's
    representative submitted  that  all  the  documents  in  Annex  A  were
    submitted with the application but in Annex B  some  of  the  documents
    were not submitted with the application.  I asked what date  the  money
    was transferred on  and  was  told  it  was  10th  January  2014.   The
    Presenting  Officer  submitted  that  what  was  submitted   with   the
    application is in the Respondent's bundle on file.  I  am  disregarding
    Annex B.

 9. I was referred to the refusal letter.  The company  was  registered  on
    24th June 2013 and the Appellant's  father  transferred  the  money  in
    January 2014.  The company started  trading  in  August  2013  and  the
    Presenting Officer asked the Appellant if he had not needed  the  money
    in August 2013. He asked why  the  money  was  transferred  six  months
    later.  He asked him if it was transferred because of this  application
    and was told that it was not.  The Appellant said he had not needed the
    money any earlier as this was a new business and  the  money  was  only
    needed as the business grew.  He was asked about start-up costs and the
    Appellant said he had had some money of his own and the �50,000  is  to
    enable him to develop the business.

10. The Presenting Officer referred me to a Lloyds Bank letter  dated  31st
    March 2014, addressed to Musrat Ltd, the Appellant's company.  This  is
    the letter opening the bank account.  The bank statement is at page 113
    of the Appellant's bundle and on 21st August 2013  when  the  Appellant
    started trading there was �416.12 in the bank and on 22nd July 2013 the
    balance in the account was �5.53.  The Appellant was asked why  he  did
    not need more start-up money and he said he just needed bits and pieces
    of money when he started so he could register the company and take  out
    insurance indemnity and the like and that the  �50,000  is  needed  for
    developing the business.  He said that he later needed to get a website
    and do some training and that is when he asked his father for financial
    help.  He said his father then had to gather the money together and  at
    the same time he, the Appellant, had to sort out his residence  in  the
    United Kingdom.

11. The Presenting Officer asked the Appellant about the  contract  between
    Musrat Ltd and Michael Page International Recruitment Ltd which  is  at
    page 138 of the Appellant's bundle.   He  pointed  out  that  there  is
    nothing in the contract to  show  it  has  been  signed  electronically
    although it is dated 24th February 2014.  The Appellant said  that  the
    contract has been taken as signed on that  date.   He  was  asked  what
    services Musrat Ltd will be providing  to  Michael  Page  International
    Recruitment Ltd and he said financial services advice,  on  compliance.
    He  said  that  Musrat  Ltd  introduced  certain  procedures  into  the
    recruitment company and ensured that the company was being  run  within
    the compliance Regulations so that the company would not be  fined  for
    misdemeanours.  He was asked why a recruitment company would need  that
    kind of advice and he said that he was actually doing the work  for  an
    asset management company which is  one  of  the  recruitment  company's
    clients.  He said that the asset management company  is  called  "State
    Street".  He said that it is a PLC and its turnover is in  billions  of
    pounds.  The Presenting Officer asked him if he had been  entrusted  to
    deal with the FSA compliance procedures and  he  said  that  a  company
    called Navigant owns the consultancy  part  of  State  Street  and  the
    Appellant's company forms a resource for that company.  He said the end
    client is State Street and he was asked if he was advising Navigant and
    he said he was going through Navigant but working for State Street.  He
    again said that the work he does forms a resource for the company.   He
    was asked what his actual services were and he said he looked into  the
    way the company deals with their clients under the  Financial  Services
    Act, Rules.

12. The Presenting Officer returned to the question of the transfer of  the
    funds from the Appellant's father.  The Appellant  confirmed  that  his
    father works for Nestles.  He was asked why his father could  not  send
    the money through Nestles and he said it is  not  his  company,  he  is
    employed by them.

13. The Appellant was asked about his business plan and who wrote it.   The
    Appellant said that he wrote it.  It was put to him that in the refusal
    letter it is stated that a lot of the business plan has been taken  out
    of the business plan belonging to another company.  The Appellant  said
    he had done research before he wrote the plan so some  of  the  clauses
    have been taken out of other companies' business plans.  He  was  asked
    if he  has  a  website  for  Musrat  Ltd  and  he  said  he  has  under
    musratltd.co.uk.  The Presenting Officer said he had Googled  this  but
    it had not shown up.  The Appellant said the full  address  has  to  be
    typed in as  he  cannot  afford  optimisation  at  this  stage  in  his
    business.  He said some  of  the  other  companies  deal  with  private
    financial services.  He said he had not prepared the website himself.

14. The Presenting Officer asked the Appellant about the work he was  doing
    for Hays Recruiting Services.  He said that  again  it  was  compliance
    management relating to financial services.  It was put to him that  the
    contract with them is very generalised and actually refers to him as  a
    temporary worker so it looks as if he was actually an employee of  that
    company.  The Presenting Officer put to the Appellant that  you  cannot
    tell from the contract that  it  is  for  compliance  management.   The
    Appellant said that that is the way the contracts are  issued  by  that
    company.  He said the contract is just  confirmation  of  him  being  a
    consultant for Hays.  He said the actual work he did was for  Barclays,
    through Hays.

15. I asked the Appellant if he had two contracts, one for Hays and one for
    Barclays.  He  said  there  is  only  one  contract  through  Hays  for
    Barclays.  He said that before he started his own company he  had  been
    doing temporary work with Hays for Barclays.  The contract is dated 8th
    July 2013.

16. The Presenting Officer asked the Appellant if his business has accounts
    and he said it has and details were put in with  his  application.   He
    then said that the accounts were  not  completed  before  he  made  his
    application but they have been submitted to Companies House.   He  said
    he made the application on 13th March 2014.

17. Once the money was paid by the Appellant's father to his cousin it  was
    then transferred to the Appellant but shortly after that it  was  again
    transferred out of the Appellant's account to a friend of his.  I asked
    him about this.  He said his friend is a research  student  and  needed
    the money as he wanted to move stuff to Nigeria.  He said he  had  lent
    him the money but he did not do the deal so he gave the money back.   I
    asked him what would have happened if his friend had done the deal  and
    he said his friend had wanted to buy goods and resell them and it would
    have been very quick so he would have got the money  back  quickly.   I
    asked him for evidence of this but he was unable to give me any.  I put
    to him that he was taking a big risk lending this sum of money  to  his
    friend and he said he trusted his friend and  had  compassion  for  his
    situation.

18. There was no re-examination by Counsel.

19. The Presenting Officer made his  submissions  relying  on  the  refusal
    letter.  He submitted that the Respondent is  not  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant intends to establish  a  business.   He  submitted  that  the
    Respondent does not believe that the Appellant has a genuine intent  to
    invest the money or that the money is available to  him  based  on  the
    evidence which has been produced.   He  submitted  that  there  are  no
    documents showing where the �50,000 came from i.e.  the  provenance  of
    the funds.  The Appellant has now given an explanation stating that the
    funds came from his father's bank account but the  bank  statement  and
    the letter from  the  bank  which  have  now  been  provided  were  not
    submitted with the application and no good reason has been given as  to
    why they were not submitted.  He submitted that  there  has  been  some
    suspicious activity relating to this money.  He submitted  that  it  is
    not clear why the money was transferred from the money transfer company
    to the Appellant's cousin and that no  sooner  was  the  money  in  the
    Appellant's account then it was transferred to a friend before it  came
    back to the Appellant.  He  submitted  that  if  the  money  is  indeed
    intended for the Appellant to establish a new company and is needed for
    that, it is not credible that he would take the risk of transferring it
    to a friend and he submitted that the Respondent does not believe  that
    these funds are available to the Appellant.

20. He submitted that the  Appellant's  father  transferred  the  funds  in
    January 2014 but the Appellant was trading in June 2013.  He  submitted
    that based on the bank statements for the company it  is  not  credible
    that the Appellant did not need the money at the outset to set  matters
    up.  He submitted that start-up costs are expensive.  He submitted that
    based on what is before me it seems that  the  money  was  put  forward
    purely to boost  this  Tier  1  application.   He  submitted  that  the
    Appellant's business is not a genuine business.  The business plan  was
    copied from another company's business plan and the website was  copied
    from another company's website.  He submitted that everything has  been
    manufactured and he referred to the services which the Appellant states
    he provided for Michael Page International and  Hays  Asset  Management
    Company.  He submitted that the contracts are in very general terms and
    the answers to the questions the Appellant was  asked  at  the  hearing
    were vague and general.  There is no evidence of Navigant being an  arm
    of the asset management  company  and  there  are  no  details  in  the
    evidence which are specific and for this kind of business that would be
    necessary.  The Appellant referred to  his  client  as  a  PLC  but  no
    details have been given about this.  It is not clear  relating  to  the
    Hay/Barclays contract how the complaints  mentioned  by  the  Appellant
    were settled.  He submitted that the contracts  are  not  specific  and
    there has been no explanation about why the Appellant did not  get  any
    documents from Hays or from Michael Page about what work was done.

21. The Presenting Officer submitted that this application  does  not  show
    that the Appellant genuinely intends to start a business  or  that  the
    funds are genuinely available to him.

22. I was asked to dismiss the appeal under the Rules.

23. He submitted that there are no Article 8 matters in this claim and this
    has been accepted by the Appellant and his solicitor.

24. The Appellant's representative made his submissions submitting that the
    Appellant's application is viable and credible.  He submitted  that  it
    is credible that his father, who works for Nestles, would give his  son
    money to set up a company in the United  Kingdom.   He  submitted  that
    there is nothing to disprove  that  and  although  the  refusal  letter
    states that the Respondent has difficulties with  this  money  being  a
    gift to the Appellant from his father, there is  nothing  to  say  that
    that is not the case.  He submitted that money has been  given  by  one
    family member to another to help that family member get on in life  and
    this is not incredible and should be accepted by the Home  Office.   He
    submitted that the money was transferred into the  Appellant's  account
    and is in the Appellant's possession and he submitted that all that  is
    required in terms of the Rules is that the money is in the  Appellant's
    possession.

25. With regard to the question of why the money  was  transferred  a  long
    time  after  the  company  had  started,  Counsel  submitted  that  the
    Appellant has fully explained this at the hearing today.  He  submitted
    that the Appellant was able to pay the start-up costs himself  for  the
    company and at the present time the company has traded very little  and
    is a small company.  He submitted that the Appellant's  statement  that
    the money will be used to grow his business  is  a  credible,  sensible
    explanation.  He submitted that the fact that the money was transferred
    after the company started trading  should  not  raise  any  credibility
    issues.

26. Counsel submitted that the insurance documents are on file, as are bank
    statements and that the viability of the funds should be accepted.

27. With regard to the business plan, Counsel submitted that when the  Tier
    1 interview record  is  considered  it  appears  that  the  experienced
    interviewer's opinion is that this  is  a  credible  entrepreneur.   He
    states that  the  customer  answered  the  majority  of  the  questions
    satisfactorily and states "I  therefore  deem  him  to  be  a  credible
    entrepreneur at the interview stage of his application."  I  was  asked
    to give this considerable weight.  He submitted that it is not  unusual
    to take clauses from another business plan for your own  business  plan
    when you are setting up a company.  He submitted that the Appellant did
    not set up the website himself and again the  fact  that  some  of  the
    clauses come  from  other  websites  does  not  make  them  wrong.   He
    submitted that the Appellant placed himself in the shoes  of  a  larger
    company when setting up his business as he hopes to expand his business
    considerably in the future.

28. He referred to the Appellant's accountant being based in  Scotland  and
    submitted that  this  person  was  recommended  to  the  Appellant  and
    documents can  be  sent  back  and  forwards  and  the  fact  that  the
    accountant is in Scotland should not be held against this  application.



29. I was referred to  the  refusal  letter  in  which  the  Respondent  is
    concerned about the Appellant's business experience.  I was referred to
    the Appellant's witness statement in which it is made clear that he has
    two degrees from the United Kingdom in finance and  business,  being  a
    degree in accountancy and a masters degree in  finance  and  management
    and he submitted that this must be sufficient for this project.

30. I was asked to find that the application is credible and viable  and  I
    was asked to allow the appeal.

Decision and Reasons

31. The burden of proof is on the  Appellant  and  all  the  terms  of  the
    Immigration  Rules  relating  to  Tier  1  entrepreneurs,  have  to  be
    satisfied.  The standard of proof is the balance of  probabilities  and
    the Respondent is not satisfied that on the  balance  of  probabilities
    the Appellant genuinely intends and is able to establish, take over  or
    become a director of one or more businesses within the next six  months
    or that he genuinely intends to invest the money referred to in table 4
    of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules in his business or businesses.

32. The first issue is the �50,000 which has to be in his own possession or
    in the financial accounts of a UK incorporated business of which he  is
    a director or has to be available from a third party or  parties  named
    in the application under the terms of the declaration  referred  to  in
    paragraph 41-SD(b) of Appendix A.

33. The Appellant has explained  why  his  father  used  a  money  transfer
    company to send the money  to  the  Appellant.   The  transfer  company
    however did not pay the money from  the  Appellant's  father  into  the
    Appellant's or his company's bank account.  Instead the money was  paid
    into the Appellant's cousin's account.  The Appellant's explanation  is
    that it was this cousin who introduced him to the transfer company  but
    I do not find that it makes sense for the transfer company to have done
    this and I have noted that no objections were  made  by  the  Appellant
    when this was done although this must surely have been an error on  the
    part of the transfer company.  His cousin then passed the money to  the
    Appellant who very quickly moved it out of his account into the account
    of a person the Appellant describes as a friend who  wanted  to  export
    goods from the United Kingdom to Nigeria and sell them and  needed  the
    money urgently.  This is not a credible explanation.  The Appellant  is
    depending on  this  �50,000  to  enable  his  visa  application  to  be
    successful and I find it to lack credibility that he  would  take  this
    kind of risk with the money if his application was genuine.  The  money
    is now in the Appellant's possession which is what is required  by  the
    Rules but, I have difficulty  finding  that  he  genuinely  intends  to
    invest the money in his business. I find that it  is  likely  that  the
    money has been  obtained  by  the  Appellant  solely  to  satisfy  this
    application.

34. When the Appellant started up his business he had very little money  in
    the bank.  Start-up costs, especially insurance indemnity premiums  are
    normally very expensive but the Appellant's evidence is that he did not
    require much money and it was  only  when  he  started  thinking  about
    developing his business that he asked  his  father  to  lend  him  some
    money.  This was six months after the start-up of  the  business.   The
    Appellant states that �7,500 of his own money forms part of the �50,000
    but this �50,000 was all paid to the Appellant  from  his  father  and,
    there is no evidence that any of the money belonged originally  to  the
    Appellant.  We have now been given a letter from the Appellant's father
    and a bank statement in the Appellant's father's name but I  am  unable
    to take these into account as in  terms  of  the  Rules,  all  required
    documents have to be submitted  with  the  application  otherwise  they
    cannot be relied on.  There is therefore a lack of  evidence  of  where
    the money came from.

35. The Appellant has certainly registered a company called Musrat Ltd.   I
    have to decide whether he genuinely intends to  establish  a  business,
    before his visa can be granted to him.

36. I have noted the  Respondent's  objection  to  the  business  plan  and
    website using clauses from other companies' business plans or websites.
     This is quite a normal thing and I am not unduly concerned about this.



37. The Appellant was not asked any questions about any market research  he
    might have done but when he was interviewed, he appeared to be  unaware
    of  how  many  other  businesses  traded  in  his  area  as   financial
    consultants.  When his contracts are  considered  these  are  extremely
    general and when the Appellant was asked about what  work  he  did  for
    Michael  Page  International  Recruitment  Ltd  and   Hays   Recruiting
    Services, his answers were in general terms and there is  nothing  from
    either of these companies to state what work  they  wanted  done,  what
    work he actually did and what exactly the Appellant was advising  these
    companies about. Companies like Barclays and Navigant Consulting Europe
    Ltd are big companies and I find that it would be normal for  there  to
    be evidence from the companies themselves of exactly what business  was
    transacted by the Appellant on their  behalf.   The  Respondent  states
    that the Hays contract is an employment contract.  It  certainly  could
    be, but the Appellant has stated that that is not the case.  I  am  not
    satisfied with the contracts as a whole.

38. I am not concerned that the Appellant has employed an  accountant  from
    Scotland in the circumstances, although it is sometimes handy  to  have
    somebody close at hand to deal with your accounts.

39. I have noted that the Appellant has good qualifications from the United
    Kingdom but he has very little business experience.

40. I have noted that the Appellant was found to be credible at his initial
    interview on 13th May 2014.  It seems that he was employed by  Hays  at
    the time he claims to have started his own  company  and  became  self-
    employed.  In the contract for Hays/Barclays, Hays refers to him  as  a
    PAYE temporary worker for the payroll and not the  contracted  company.
    The self billing for this however was sent to Musrat Ltd from Hays.  It
    mentions  the  Appellant  as  "the  worker".    On   the   balance   of
    probabilities, I find that the Appellant was an agency worker  and  not
    the worker of a subcontracted company called Musrat Ltd.  The  evidence
    provided is not sufficient to demonstrate that  he  was  operating  his
    company by fulfilling contracts.

41. The evidence given by the Appellant today is that his father  does  not
    have a company and  yet  the  Appellant  claims  to  have  managed  his
    father's family business  in  Nigeria.   His  father  is  in  full-time
    employment with Nestles.  What the Appellant  seems  to  have  done  is
    managed his father's financial affairs, if indeed he did that.

42. I find that the Appellant has a lack  of  knowledge  of  what  he  will
    actually be doing during his working day relating to his consultancy on
    the financial  services  of  big  companies  like  Barclays  and  I  am
    concerned about the lack of detail he was able to give the Tribunal  of
    what exactly he would be doing for these companies.  I  do  not  really
    understand why big companies like these would employ a new company with
    one director to carry out their compliance under the Financial Services
    Act but this is merely conjecture.

43. My main problem however is the money.  The Appellant has  a  number  of
    bank accounts and money is transferred from one to the other regularly.
     Some of the bank statements are missing.  No reason has been given for
    the funds being moved from one account  to  the  other  and  I  am  not
    satisfied with the provenance of the funds.  I therefore find  that  on
    the balance of probabilities, these funds may well not be available for
    investment into the Appellant's business.  The way the money  was  paid
    into his bank account is strange but the real credibility issue for  me
    is that the Appellant, as soon as he received  the  funds,  transferred
    them to Richard Ittaman because he needed funds to set  up  a  business
    connected to Nigeria.  This is totally incredible.  I find that if  the
    Appellant was setting up a genuine business he would not have done this
    and the fact that he has done this and the lack  of  credibility  I  am
    attaching thereto, gives a lack of  credibility  to  the  rest  of  the
    evidence.  I accept that the Appellant has in  his  possession  �50,000
    but I am not satisfied that he intends to invest it to set up a genuine
    business.

44. Based on what  is  before  me,  I  find  that  the  Appellant  has  not
    satisfactorily demonstrated that he is a genuine  entrepreneur  as  set
    out at paragraph  245DD(h)  and  when  assessing,  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities,  the  points  listed  at  paragraph  245DD(i)   of   the
    Immigration Rules, I find that I have to dismiss the appeal.  The terms
    of the Immigration Rules have not been satisfied.

45. With regard to Article 8 of ECHR, this Appellant has been in the United
    Kingdom as a student and a post-study work migrant.  All of  his  visas
    have a clause which states that the Appellant has to return to  Nigeria
    when the term of  the  visas  end.   He  has  never  had  a  legitimate
    expectation of remaining in the United Kingdom.  I accept that  he  has
    private life in the United Kingdom.  I know nothing  about  his  family
    life.

46. Based on the Immigration Rules and the Article 8 aspect of these  Rules
    this Appellant's application cannot succeed on  human  rights  grounds.
    Both parties at the hearing  accepted  that  there  are  no  Article  8
    matters.
