For the Appellant:     Mr G Saunders, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms M Cohen of Counsel instructed by Wilson
Solicitors LLP


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is the appeal of the Secretary of State but we will refer  to  the
    original appellant, a citizen of Lithuania born on 4 October  1965,  as
    the appellant herein.

2.   The appellant arrived in this country in May  1998  as  a  visitor  and
    applied for asylum in January 1999.  This application  was  only  dealt
    with after a long delay in May 2012.

3.   The appellant has been addicted to heroin since his experiences in  the
    Russian army in Afghanistan in the mid 1980s.  He has  been  prescribed
    methadone as treatment for controlled drug dependency.  He has residual
    symptoms of PTSD.

4.   The appellant has a lengthy criminal  history  largely  caused  by  his
    desire to obtain money to fuel his drug dependency.

5.   On 8 June 2010 at Snaresbrook Crown Court the appellant  was  convicted
    of robbery and sentenced to three years and six months' imprisonment.

6.   The sentencing judge noted that the appellant  had  pleaded  guilty  at
    the first available opportunity to a robbery of a lady of  60  who  was
    the sole occupant of her shop as she opened it  in  the  morning.   The
    appellant had sought to attack the shopkeeper and had taken about  �150
    to �200 from the till.  He had pushed her through  the  back  door  and
    into the storeroom but because the appellant could not get out  he  had
    had to get her assistance to exit the shop  and  he  had  led  out  the
    shopkeeper too.  The judge found that  the  appellant  had  attacked  a
    vulnerable individual and that the offence represented a  huge  step-up
    in the appellant's offending behaviour.

7.   On 22 May 2012 the respondent decided to deport the appellant,  on  the
    same day refusing his application for asylum.

8.   An appeal was lodged against the Secretary of State's decision but  the
    appeal was not proceeded with on asylum grounds before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal who dismissed that aspect of the case and we need  to  say  no
    more about it.

9.   The appellant's appeal came before a panel on  4  June  2013  when  the
    appellant was represented, as he was before us, by Ms Cohen.  The panel
    heard oral evidence from the appellant.  The panel also had the benefit
    of  a  report  from  a  consultant  psychiatrist,  a  letter  from  the
    appellant's probation officer and medical documentation in  respect  of
    the appellant.  The appellant was expected to have surgery on  the  day
    following the hearing at Hillingdon Hospital.

10.  The appellant had had a number of opportunities in the past to  address
    his drug dependency and the panel turned to assess the  credibility  of
    his evidence that he would not suffer another relapse.  It  was  agreed
    that he had not had any alcohol or drug relapse or  problems  while  in
    custody for the period of three years since his  imprisonment.   Having
    assessed the appellant's evidence-in-chief and in cross-examination the
    panel found the appellant to be genuine, honest  and  credible  in  his
    evidence as to his belief that there would be no further relapses.  The
    panel also accepted him as genuine and credible in his  acceptance  and
    regret of his past conduct.  The panel noted the appellant had attended
    a number of courses in prison  and  had  been  made  aware  of  various
    supporting systems which would be  of  substantial  assistance  to  the
    appellant on his release.  The  panel  found  genuine  the  appellant's
    evidence that he wanted to see  his  grandson  who  had  been  born  in
    December 2012.  He was concerned that he might not have much longer  to
    live, particularly in the light of the pending  operation.   The  panel
    took into account the courses undertaken by the appellant and the  fact
    that he would be supervised  on  his  release  was  well  as  receiving
    support from  the  community  mental  health  team,  the  Hackney  Drug
    Treatment Agency and an alcohol treatment provider.  The panel accepted
    the appellant's evidence that he  would  readily  co-operate  with  the
    supervision and assistance.  The appellant was found  to  be  genuinely
    contrite and genuinely determined to rehabilitate himself.

11.  The panel considered the submissions based on the Regulations  and  the
    appellant's length of residence.  The panel considered Regulation 21 of
    the EEA Regulations.  It was accepted  that  the  appellant  could  not
    establish a permanent right of residence under Regulations 21(3) as  he
    had not resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period  of  five
    years in accordance with the Regulations.  The  panel  found  that  the
    appellant could not establish that he had resided in the United Kingdom
    for a continuous period of ten years to bring himself within Regulation
    21(4)(a)  having  considered  FV  (Italy)  [2012]  EWCA  Civ  1199  and
    Tsakouridis [2011] 2CMLR 11.  The panel noted that it had been accepted
    by Ms Cohen that the question of integration was a basic factor in  the
    assessment of continuous residence under Regulation 21(4)(a).

12.  In the circumstances the panel turned to  consider  the  issues  raised
    under Regulation 21(1) and whether the decision had been taken  on  the
    grounds of public policy, public security or public health.  The  panel
    then considered Regulation 21(5) and (6):


         '(5) Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public policy
             or public security it shall, in addition to complying with the
             preceding  paragraphs  of  this  Regulation,   be   taken   in
             accordance with the following principles:-


             (a)   the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
                  proportionality;


             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
                  conduct of the person concerned;


             (c)   the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned  must
                  represent a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
                  threat affecting  one  of  the  fundamental  interests  of
                  society;


             (d)  matters isolated from  particulars  of  the  case  or  to
                  relate to considerations  of  general  prevention  do  not
                  justify the decision;


             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
                  themselves justify the decision.


         (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on  the  grounds  of  public
             policy or public security in  relation  to  a  person  who  is
             resident in the United Kingdom the decision  maker  must  take
             account of considerations such as the age,  state  of  health,
             family and economic situation  of  the  person,  the  person's
             length of residence in the United Kingdom, the person's social
             and cultural integration  into  the  United  Kingdom  and  the
             extent of the person's links with his country of origin."

13.  The panel found that the appellant's state of health was precarious  at
    best and reiterated that the  appellant  had  impressed  the  panel  as
    genuine in his determination not to relapse.   There  was  very  little
    contact between the appellant and his son and his social  and  cultural
    integration into the United Kingdom had been of  an  extremely  limited
    nature.  His links with Lithuania were also  limited  and  he  had  not
    lived there for the previous fifteen years.

14.  The panel turned to consider  the  issues  in  Regulation  21(5).   The
    panel noted that the line to be drawn in assessing the requirements  of
    Regulation 21(5)(c) was a difficult one.  It found that the appellant's
    conduct had represented  a  genuine  and  sufficiently  serious  threat
    affecting one of the fundamental interests of society in the  past  and
    it would continue to do so unless the appellant was  able  properly  to
    rehabilitate himself and not relapse.  That would depend on his  future
    conduct.  The panel found that he had a genuine determination to  avoid
    relapsing and to concentrate on rebuilding his health in  view  of  his
    serious  health  problems  and  because  of  his  desire  to  build   a
    relationship with his son and grandson.  The  threat  was  nevertheless
    present because it was a hope for the future that he would not relapse.

15.  The panel considered the  cases  of  Essa  [2012]  EWCA  Civ  1718  and
    Tsakouridis and the issue of rehabilitation.   It  found  that  if  the
    appellant  was  able  to  avoid  relapsing  then   the   prospects   of
    rehabilitation would be very substantial.  The appellant would  have  a
    comprehensive rehabilitation programme in the United Kingdom and  there
    was no indication that  any  such  rehabilitative  programme  would  be
    available in Lithuania although appropriate medical treatment would be.
     The panel did not consider that the Secretary of State's decision  was
    proportionate in all the circumstances and allowed the appeal under the
    Regulations.  The panel emphasised that if the appellant did  not  take
    the opportunity to rehabilitate himself and refrain from offending, any
    future assessment would be different.

16.  The Secretary of State appealed the decision  on  the  basis  that  the
    issue of  rehabilitation  was  not  a  material  consideration  in  the
    proportionality assessment given that the  panel  had  found  that  the
    appellant had not integrated into UK society.  In the  alternative,  in
    the absence of evidence of the prospects of rehabilitation in Lithuania
    the panel was not in a position to be able to make a comparison between
    rehabilitation in the two countries.  The panel's  findings  about  the
    appellant's prospects for rehabilitation in the UK were speculative.

17.  The First-tier Tribunal  refused  the  application  for  permission  to
    appeal finding that rehabilitation was a relevant consideration for the
    panel in  the  light  of  the  appellant's  state  of  health  and  the
    importance that absence from drug abuse was to that  state  of  health.
    However Upper Tribunal Judge Macleman granted permission to  appeal  on
    26 July 2013 finding it debateable whether  prospective  rehabilitation
    in the UK ruled out deportation of a person not integrated in the UK.

18.  On 12 August 2013 the appellant filed a reply drafted by Ms Cohen.   It
    was submitted that the principle of rehabilitation was relevant and  Ms
    Cohen referred among other things to the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to refuse the  application  for  permission  to  appeal.   The
    Secretary of State had adduced no evidence in relation to the prospects
    for rehabilitation and there were  no  submissions  by  the  Presenting
    Officer on the subject either.

19.  Mr Saunders submitted that the First-tier Tribunal  had  not  conducted
    an overall assessment.  While there was not a  bright  line  concerning
    rehabilitation no integration had been found in this case and there was
    no reason why rehabilitation  should  not  take  place  in  the  United
    Kingdom rather than Lithuania.  All the appellant had was a  decade  or
    so of residence of no  great  quality.   There  was  no  evidence  that
    Lithuania lacked facilities that might be required for  the  appellant.
    Reference was made to paragraph 95  of  the  opinion  of  the  advocate
    general in Tsakouridis.  In the Court of Appeal in Essa at paragraph 16
    the Court of Appeal had found the opinion to be  over  prescriptive  in
    stating it was incumbent  upon  a  primary  decision  maker  "to  state
    precisely in what way that decision does not prejudice  the  offender's
    rehabilitation".

20.  Ms Cohen relied on her response.  While  the  question  of  integration
    was of some weight it  was  not  the  only  factor  and  the  issue  of
    rehabilitation was a relevant factor.  It had been accepted  that  this
    was not a bright line issue.  It was a question of fact.  The  case  of
    Essa [2013] UKUT 00316 (IAC) did not  assist  Mr  Saunders.   Ms  Cohen
    referred to paragraph 28 of  Essa  -  the  longer  the  residence,  the
    greater the degree of integration was likely to be - this  indicated  a
    fact-sensitive approach was required.

21.  The appellant had resided in this country for fourteen  years  and  the
    length of residence was a weighty factor  to  place  into  the  scales.
    There  may  be  cases  where   there   was   little   integration   but
    rehabilitation would mean the decision would be resolved in the  favour
    of the appellant.

22.  There was a principle involved in that it was not in the  interests  of
    the  EU  for  persons  to  be  removed  to  the  detriment   of   their
    rehabilitation.  The panel had made a  reasoned  decision  taking  into
    account factors such as the medical issues and the  courses  undertaken
    by the appellant.  What was  said  in  paragraph  35  of  the  Tribunal
    decision in Essa was obiter and of course the panel  had  not  had  the
    case before it.  It was clear the panel had the consideration in  mind.
    The appellant had demonstrated a genuine commitment to avoid a relapse.
     Accordingly he was not likely to  remain  a  present  threat  for  the
    indefinite future.

23.  Mr Saunders submitted that what had been said in Essa in  paragraph  26
    was not obiter.  Genuine integration  must  be  directed  at  qualified
    persons.  People who had just arrived and had not yet become  qualified
    persons or had not been qualified persons for five years  could  always
    be removed.  If their presence during their period  of  residence  made
    them a present threat to public policy it would  be  inconsistent  with
    the  purposes  of  the  Directive  to  weigh  in  the  balance  against
    deportation their future prospects of rehabilitation.

24.  The appellant had been in  the  UK  for  fourteen  years  but  had  not
    integrated for fourteen years.  This was not a question of being partly
    integrated.  The issue of rehabilitation did not arise at all.

25.  At the conclusion of the submissions  we  reserved  our  decision.   We
    remind ourselves that we can only interfere with the  determination  if
    it was flawed in law.  We further remind ourselves that the  First-tier
    Tribunal had the benefit of hearing oral evidence  from  the  appellant
    and were plainly impressed by what he said.

26.  The key issue in this case is whether the panel erred  in  taking  into
    account prospective rehabilitation in the UK.   Mr  Saunders  took  the
    point that because the appellant was not integrated the issue  did  not
    arise.

27.  Of course if the panel had taken  into  account  an  irrelevant  matter
    their decision would be flawed in law.  Under paragraph  21(6)  of  the
    2006 Regulations, which we have set out above, the  decision  maker  is
    required  to  take  into   account   various   considerations.    These
    considerations are not expressed  as  an  exhaustive  list.   They  are
    considerations "such as the age,  state  of  health"  etc.   Among  the
    factors is the question of the length of residence and state of health.
     There is also the issue of the appellant's links with the  country  of
    origin.  The panel refers to the relevant factors in paragraphs 118  to
    119 of its decision.  It refers to the appellant's  age  and  state  of
    health.  It refers to the appellant's efforts at rehabilitation.  There
    is the issue of his operation.   It  found  the  appellant's  state  of
    health to be under threat.  There was also the issue of limited  social
    and  cultural  integration.   There  were  however  limited  links   to
    Lithuania although he had spent his formative years there.

28.  We do not see that the panel misdirected itself  in  referring  to  the
    issue of rehabilitation in  relation  to  Regulation  21(6).   Firstly,
    Regulation 21(6) is not an exhaustive list of circumstances to be taken
    into consideration.  Certainly it would be difficult  to  deal  with  a
    person's state of health without  considering  what  steps  were  being
    taken to resolve health issues.  The health issues were such  that  the
    appellant was in doubt about how long he had to live and  this  was  of
    course one of the factors that impressed the panel when  it  considered
    that the appellant's motivation for change was  genuine.   This  was  a
    case where the panel found that the prospects for  rehabilitation  were
    both realistic and substantial in the United Kingdom  and  while  there
    was  medical  treatment  available  in  Lithuania  the   rehabilitative
    programme available to the appellant in the UK would not  be  available
    in Lithuania.  This was a case in which the appellant was on  the  road
    to rehabilitation and the panel found that the threat to society  would
    very substantially diminish if the  appellant  did  not  relapse.   The
    panel found that there was  no  capacity  or  interest  to  assist  the
    appellant in  Lithuania  in  a  similar  fashion  and  as  is  said  in
    paragraphs 24 to 26 of the appellant's reply no evidence had  been  put
    before the panel on the matter and no submissions had been made at  the
    hearing on the subject.

29.  The key question in this case is whether  the  panel  erred  in  taking
    into account the issue of the appellant's rehabilitation in the  United
    Kingdom and the effect on that rehabilitation of removal.

30.  We are  unable  to  conclude  that  the  panel  took  into  account  an
    irrelevant matter.  What is said in Regulation 21(6) as we have said is
    wide enough to include this consideration.  The impact of removal would
    in every case be a fact sensitive exercise.   The  panel  clearly  went
    into the facts of this case in very great detail.  It had a  number  of
    difficult technical issues to resolve.

31.  The negative impact of removal on rehabilitation  will  of  course  not
    always be a decisive factor.  We accept that the impact will be greater
    in the case of an integrated EU citizen but we do not accept that it is
    a factor not to be taken into account when dealing with a  person  such
    as the appellant who has been in this country for a number of years and
    has only limited ties with his country of origin as  the  panel  found.
    While the Court of Appeal in Essa noted that the ECJ  had  not  adopted
    the suggestion in the advocate general's opinion that a decision  maker
    should state precisely in what way the decision did not  prejudice  the
    offender's rehabilitation no doubt the panel would have  been  assisted
    by some material on the matter.  We are not satisfied  that  the  panel
    materially misdirected itself in commenting on the absence of material.
     It may be that not every panel would have reached  the  same  decision
    but as we have said it  did  have  the  benefit  of  hearing  from  the
    appellant and assessing the evidence with very great care.   The  panel
    did not reach this decision lightly.  In the circumstances of this case
    we are not persuaded it materially misdirected itself.  As it noted  in
    paragraph 134 of its decision this is  very  likely  to  be  the  final
    opportunity of the appellant  to  demonstrate  that  he  can  take  the
    advantage of the opportunity he has been offered.

32.  We are grateful  to  Mr  Saunders  for  his  characteristically  clear,
    concise and trenchant submissions.  However, for the  reasons  we  have
    given we find that the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  not
    materially flawed in law and we direct that it shall stand.
