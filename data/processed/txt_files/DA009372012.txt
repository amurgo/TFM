                           DETERMINATION & REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Maurice Cohen and a lay member), sitting at Kingston on
    25 January, to  a deportation appeal  by  a  citizen  of  Albania.  The
    appellant illegally entered this country and falsely, as he now admits,
    claimed asylum, as an inhabitant of Kosovo in 1999: his appeal  against
    refusal of that was finally dismissed on 21 February 2001, but the Home
    Office went on considering representations on his behalf till 2009.

 2. Also in 2009, on 23 June the appellant  was  fined  for  possession  of
    class 'A' drugs; on 23 August his son Rey Malko Shazivari was born,  to
    Adisa Malko, now a British citizen, and 35. Not long  after  that,  the
    appellant was caught in possession of criminal property to the value of
    just  under  �23,000,  and  what  the  sentencing  judge  described  as
    "significant amounts of cocaine": after about eight months  in  custody
    on remand, and following a trial, he was convicted and on 25  May  2010
    sentenced to six years' imprisonment. A deportation order automatically
    followed, served after some further inquiries on 26 October  2012.  The
    panel allowed the appellant's appeal  under  article  8  of  the  Human
    Rights Convention, on the strength of his  family  life.  Earlier  this
    year, he was passed fit for release by HM Prison Service, but  kept  in
    immigration detention till bailed in April by a first-tier judge  whose
    reasons for doing so are not before me.

 3. Error of law    The Home Office applied for and were  given  permission
    to appeal on several grounds, the first of  which  involved  what  they
    said was the panel's failure to  give  adequate  consideration  to  the
    legitimate aim of prevention of crime, which even strong family reasons
    might not outweigh: see JO (Uganda) and JT (Ivory  Coast)  [2010]  EWCA
    Civ 10. I  invited  Miss  Tobin  to  show  me  how  they  had  properly
    considered that, and she referred me to a number  of  passages  in  the
    panel's decision, first at paragraphs 2 and 4, setting out the fact  of
    the appellant's conviction and the Home Office's argument on  it;  then
    passim, referring in general terms to the need to  maintain  "effective
    law and order".

 4. In my view this was not enough: this was a very serious crime,  with  a
    sentence many times longer  than  required  to  bring  about  automatic
    deportation. The panel needed to show that they  had  themselves  taken
    into consideration that  there  was  a  correspondingly  strong  public
    interest in the appellant's removal: then if, as  they  decided,  there
    were even stronger family reasons against it, they  could  balance  the
    two properly against each other. As it was, they did not show that they
    had properly considered the public interest side of the case, and  that
    was an error of law which requires a fresh hearing.

 5. Only two other points on the grounds needed mentioning at  that  stage:
    first, the panel were clearly wrong to describe the appellant as having
    come here as a minor in 1999, when even on the date of birth they  gave
    he was 24. Second, the permission judge was quite right  to  discourage
    the  Home  Office  from  relying  on  paragraph  398  et  seq.  of  the
    Immigration Rules; and they could not expect to be heard on that point,
    unless not only MF  but Izuazu (Article 8  -  new  rules)  [2013]  UKUT
    (IAC) 45 had meanwhile been overruled by the Court of Appeal.

 6. Miss Tobin asked that the panel's positive findings should be preserved
    for the re-hearing I directed: in a case of this  kind,  those  of  any
    importance concerned not the appellant's credibility as such, but  what
    they thought about the strength of his family life, on the basis of the
    view they had of him with his son in court. While their views  on  that
    are certainly something to be taken into account, this will be a  fresh
    hearing for the decision to be re-made, and in the  end  that  decision
    will be for me to take on my own view of all the  evidence,  after  the
    necessary balancing exercise.

 7. Fresh hearing   Mr Behbahani began by renewing the application  for  an
    adjournment, previously refused by another  judge,  so  that  he  could
    instruct  an  independent  social  worker  to  report  on  the  present
    situation of the appellant and his family. However when I  said  I  had
    seen the appellant with Rey at the error of law hearing, and  took  the
    view that they clearly had a genuine warm  relationship,  Mr  Behbahani
    sensibly withdrew the application.

 8. History   Both the appellant and Miss Malko gave oral  evidence  before
    me: I shall call her by her personal name, Adisa, from now on, as  this
    case is very much about the two of them, Rey and  their  second  child,
    still en ventre sa m�re but due in February, as a family,  on  the  one
    side; and the public interest on the other. The appellant and Adisa are
    both from the south of Albania, but first got to know each  other  over
    here, in 1999, when she too arrived and made a false asylum claim as  a
    Kosovan. From then till 2005 they were together in  this  country;  but
    then their relationship broke down. In 2006 Adisa's mother  suffered  a
    stroke in Albania, and she decided to make a voluntary assisted  return
    to be with her.

 9. While Adisa was back in Albania,  her  mother  introduced  her  to  the
    family of Naim Hajdini, and a marriage was arranged between them.  They
    must have met at some stage, because on 29 November 2006,  despite  her
    immigration history, she was given a visa to enter this country as  his
    fianc�e, which she did on  2  December.  Two  years'  leave  to  remain
    followed in March 2007, with indefinite leave to  remain  on  26  March
    2009. By this time, however, she  and  the  appellant  had  met  again,
    towards the end of 2008; but just before Christmas Naim found out  they
    were having an affair: nevertheless she and  Naim  got  back  together,
    till in April 2009 Adisa let the appellant know she  was  carrying  his
    child. She had known from the start that he had no right to be in  this
    country, apart from the application he was pursuing.

10. Adisa herself agreed in evidence that she must have been  aware  rather
    earlier of this pregnancy, which came to term  in  August,  though  she
    said her condition had had to be confirmed by a blood test taken by her
    GP. She accepted that she would have been aware of it  by  the  end  of
    March, when she got indefinite leave to remain as Naim's  wife,  though
    she said the two of them were still trying to save their marriage:  "he
    kind of accepted me being pregnant, but by the end of May that was it".
    So in June 2009 Adisa and the appellant moved back in together.

11. Offences  At this stage Adisa says the appellant was still gambling and
    taking drugs: on 25 June 2009 he was fined, as already  mentioned,  for
    possession of cocaine, and on 22 September caught in possession of  the
    large quantity of the drug, and the �23,000 in cash which  led  to  his
    conviction and 6 years' sentence the following May. The appellant still
    denies any involvement with class 'A' drugs beyond  simple  possession.
    His explanation is this: he had moved house with Adisa, mainly to avoid
    his old gambling and using haunts, just  before  Rey  was  born  on  23
    August 2009, and they had given a party to celebrate that.

12. When the appellant had gone out to meet a friend who  didn't  know  the
    way to his new flat, he  received  a  call  from  his  dealer  and  was
    arrested by police with a lump of cocaine  on  him.  To  his  surprise,
    these officers turned out to be not ordinary Metropolitan  Police,  but
    from the Serious Organised Crimes Agency [SOCA], and they found �23,000
    in his flat. The appellant's explanation for this was that he  had  won
    it betting, and he not only had the slips to prove it, but was able  to
    call the manageress of the betting shop to support that. As  I  pointed
    out to the appellant, and he accepted, that version of events must have
    been disbelieved by the jury, who found him  guilty  of  possession  of
    criminal property: the money was confiscated, and he went on  to  serve
    his sentence, without any appeal in those proceedings.

13. Imprisonment    What appears to be a partial copy of  a  sentence  plan
    dates back to September 2010. Later  the  appellant's  suitability  for
    release on licence was considered, and there is a  slightly  indistinct
    faxed extract from the usual Offender Assessment System  [OASys]  form,
    dated 23 November 2012. It is very clearly not the whole form,  because
    it contains only the page with the 'Summary Sheet  -  Risk  of  serious
    harm', and not the assessment of the risk of re-offending, which is  an
    important part of the document as a whole. It is the responsibility  of
    both sides in a case of this kind to put a complete OASys  form  before
    the Tribunal, and the unexplained submission of  a  partial  one,  when
    both sides had had all the time given by a  second  appeal  to  prepare
    their cases, is not acceptable. I drew this to both  sides'  attention:
    realistically neither asked for an adjournment,  which  I  should  have
    refused, both in the public interest and in the family's.

14. So far as the form goes, 'Lifestyle and associates', drug  and  alcohol
    misuse, as well as 'thinking and behaviour'  and  'attitudes'  are  all
    given as 'Linked to reoffending'; but only  drug  misuse  is  given  as
    'Linked to risk'. The risk of the appellant's causing serious  harm  is
    given as low to all categories, whether in prison or at large. The form
    is followed by a reference from a  prison  officer,  dated  23  January
    2013, describing the appellant as very well-behaved and polite, both to
    officers and prisoners.  The  reference  mentions  that  he  "...  does
    sometimes have to be  chased  to  do  his  job",  which  on  the  whole
    increases my confidence in the rest of what is said.

15. There are also certificates from various courses the appellant  did  in
    prison, including one on drugs, lasting most of January 2010;  but,  as
    the sentencing judge said,  his  own  misuse  of  drugs  was  "entirely
    incidental"  to  the  very  serious  offences  of  which  he  had  been
    convicted: "The reality was that you were ... supplying drugs  to  fund
    ... a relatively luxurious lifestyle".  A drink course report  suggests
    the appellant has been trying to overcome that problem too. Before  the
    appellant's release on 3 April 2013, e-mails from UKBA  confirmed  that
    his home address with Adisa was suitable for him to go  to.  The  final
    piece of  evidence  from  an  official  source  about  the  appellant's
    progress to which I was  referred  was  a  letter  from  his  'Offender
    Manager' at the London Probation Trust, dated 11 June, confirming  that
    since his release he had complied  with  all  supervision  and  licence
    requirements.

16. Present situation      The appellant,  Adisa  and  Rey  have  all  been
    living together in her flat since 3 April: she works  from  home  as  a
    free-lance web-site designer, and says she supports all three of  them.
    The appellant helps her round the house, especially by  taking  Rey  to
    the park when she needs peace and quiet to  work:  they  play  football
    together, and Rey rides his scooter. Other parents  she  knows  from  a
    playground where they both take Rey have told her how proud  he  is  of
    his father. He is a happy  child:  although  Adisa  speaks  to  him  in
    Albanian, he always answers in English, and has surprised her with  the
    words he knows: for example, one day when a friend of  hers  wanted  to
    prevent him scooting through the park, he complained  "Stop  protecting
    me!" In my view, as things stand, they are a very happy family,  and  I
    don't think that will change with  the  arrival  of  the  new  baby  in
    February.

17. Future    Adisa says, quite understandably, that she will stay in  this
    country whatever happens. She couldn't do her IT work in  Albania,  and
    her only relation who is close to her there, following the death of her
    mother six months ago is an aunt, not at all well herself.  Adisa  does
    have uncles in Albania too, but isn't at all close to them:  they  have
    their own families to look after, and couldn't help  her  if  she  went
    back. What Adisa likes about  this  country  is  all  the  benefits  it
    offers: not income support, which she doesn't approve of  at  all,  but
    the education and the NHS. The appellant for his part has parents still
    living in Albania;  they  would  take  him  in,  but  are  on  pensions
    themselves, and have told him there are no jobs to be had.

18.  Law        This  is  a  very  much  pronounced-on  field,  though  the
    principles have been perfectly clear since  the  UK  Borders  Act  2007
    provided for automatic deportation of those  sentenced  to  12  months'
    imprisonment or more for a single offence. Masih (deportation -  public
    interest - basic principles) Pakistan [2012] UKUT 46  (IAC)  sets  them
    out, by reference to the English  and  European  jurisprudence,  as  it
    stood at the time. So far as relevant to the present  case,  where  the
    appellant is well over 18, and, though he has spent a good deal of time
    in this country, has done so as a grown-up, and without leave, they are
    as follows

    (a)      In a case of automatic deportation, full account must be taken
        of  the  strong  public  interest  in  removing  foreign   citizens
        convicted  of  serious  offences,  which  lies  not  only  in   the
        prevention of further  offences  on  the  part  of  the  individual
        concerned, but in deterring others  from  committing  them  in  the
        first place.
    (b)     Deportation  of   foreign   criminals   expresses   society's
        condemnation of  serious  criminal  activity  and  promotes  public
        confidence in the treatment of foreign citizens who have  committed
        them.
    (c)      The starting-point for assessing the facts of the offence  of
        which an individual has been committed, and their effect on others,
        and on the public as a  whole,  must  be  the  view  taken  by  the
        sentencing judge.
    (d)     The appeal has to be dealt with on the basis of the  situation
        at the date of the hearing.
    (e)      Full account should also be taken of any  developments  since
        sentence was passed, for example the  result  of  any  disciplinary
        adjudications in prison or  detention,  or  any  OASys  or  licence
        report.

19. The very latest pronouncement by the Court of Appeal is in SS (Nigeria)
    [2013] EWCA Civ 550, inevitably by way of a re-statement of  principle,
    rather than any startling new aper�u: while it may be news to some that
    the principle involved in automatic deportation is  Parliament's  will,
    and not the Secretary of State's,  that  too  should  have  been  clear
    enough since the 2007 Act. Also  well-established  are  the  principles
    where children are concerned: as Lady Hale said in ZH (Tanzania) [2011]
    UKSC 4, their best interests are neither paramount,  nor  the  primary,
    but a  primary consideration. If explanation of that were required,  at
    paragraph 44 in SS (Nigeria) it is given as meaning 'a consideration of
    substantial importance'.



20. The Court of  Appeal's  summary  of  general  considerations  comes  at
    paragraph 47:

    (1)       The principle of  minimal  interference  is  the  essence  of
        proportionality: it ensures that the  ECHR  right  in  question  is
        never treated as a token or  a  ritual,  and  thus  guarantees  its
        force.
    (2)       In a child case the  right  in  question  (the  child's  best
        interests) is always a consideration of substantial importance.
    (3)       Article 8 contains no rule of "exceptionality", but the  more
        pressing  the  public  interest  in  removal  or  deportation,  the
        stronger must be the claim under Article 8 if it is to prevail.
    (4)        Upon  the  question  whether  the   principle   of   minimal
        interference is fulfilled,  the  primary  decision-maker  enjoys  a
        variable margin of discretion, at its broadest where  the  decision
        applies general policy created by primary legislation.

    In plain English, 'minimal interference' means that  article  8  rights
    should be interfered with as little  as  is  necessary  to  fulfil  the
    public purpose in hand.

21. The Court of Appeal had already referred  specifically  to  deportation
    cases at 46; what was said there is repeated, with added  emphasis,  at
    55:

        ... while the authorities demonstrate that  there  is  no  rule  of
        exceptionality for Article 8, they also clearly show that the  more
        pressing  the  public  interest  in  removal  or  deportation,  the
        stronger must be the claim under Article 8 if it is to prevail. The
        pressing nature of the public interest here is vividly informed  by
        the fact  that  by  Parliament's  express  declaration  the  public
        interest is injured if the criminal's deportation is not  effected.
        Such a result could in my judgment only  be  justified  by  a  very
        strong claim indeed.

22. Child/children: best interests      Although Adisa is expecting a child
    in February, it was not suggested that I should do other than  consider
    the situation at the date of the hearing, when only  Rey  is  in  legal
    terms 'in being'; but I do not think the existence of  a  second  child
    could significantly change the position in any event, except as set out
    at 24 - 25. When I made clear to Mr Behbahani  that  I  accepted  as  a
    general principle that children need a  present  father,  and  do  much
    better with one than without, he sensibly refrained  from  any  further
    reference to the numerous articles to that effect which appear  in  the
    appellant's bundle. The principle is one of ordinary common sense,  not
    requiring any 'scientific' support.

23. Whether children are happier and better off without a  present  father,
    rather than one who  continues  to  be  involved  in  serious  criminal
    offences, is not I think a question capable of any general  answer:  of
    course a criminal who gets caught is liable  not  to  be  present  very
    much. I am going to deal here with Rey's best interests in being  where
    he is now, in a happy united family; then I shall turn to  the  example
    the appellant might give him in future when I have considered the facts
    about his criminality.

24. So far as the present situation is concerned, there  can  be  no  doubt
    that it is far and away in Rey's best interests for things to  stay  as
    they are, rather than for the appellant  to  be  removed  to  Albanian,
    leaving his family here: while  Adisa  is  a  capable  and  independent
    person, she will be busy with the new baby next year and  beyond,  and,
    as soon as she can, busy with her work again. I have some  doubts  just
    how much help around the house this appellant or any other Albanian man
    is likely to be; but, having seen them together, I have no  doubt  that
    he does spend a lot of time with Rey, which  both  takes  pressure  off
    Adisa, and gives Rey the grown-up company he needs at  his  age.  In  a
    year or two Rey will be at primary school, and need less of  that;  but
    for the present he and Adisa, not to mention the new  baby,  will  need
    the appellant very much.

25. Other article 8 interests     The appellant would not be  destitute  or
    homeless on return to Albanian, and it is to his credit that he has not
    tried to pretend so. He would no doubt find it very hard  to  get  paid
    work, and lead a rather more restricted life than here, besides  losing
    direct contact with Rey and  the  new  baby,  at  ages  where  that  is
    crucial. However, all that would be his own fault, for the very serious
    crime he has committed, and not of much weight in comparison to that.

26. Adisa would also lose the appellant's help and support; but, while  she
    has committed no crime herself, and may possibly not have realized that
    the "relatively luxurious lifestyle"  referred  to  by  the  sentencing
    judge was paid for by the appellant's dealing in cocaine,  rather  than
    by gambling, she certainly did realize that he had no right  to  be  in
    this country when she took up with him again  on  her  return  here  in
    2008. Yet she chose to accept the indefinite leave to  remain  she  had
    been given as the wife of Naim, without saying anything at all  to  the
    Home Office about the situation as it really was.

27. Adisa says  she  was  still  trying  to  save  her  marriage;  but  her
    relationship with the appellant, which had lasted before  from  1999  -
    2005, was very far from a casual affair. It must  have  been  clear  to
    her, before she got indefinite leave to remain as  Naim's  wife  on  26
    March 2009, that she was carrying the appellant's child, to be born  on
    23 August; and I do not believe she meant to  do  anything  other  than
    stand by him. I have to say that in my view Adisa has, at least to that
    extent, deliberately manipulated this country's immigration  system  to
    her own advantage. While no doubt that included her view  of  the  best
    interests of her then unborn child, as  well  as  the  appellant's  and
    hers, it does mean that her article 8 rights are of  less  weight  than
    they might otherwise be.

28. Public interest There is no need to repeat what has been said  so  many
    times in so many courts about the harmful effect of  class  'A'  drugs,
    not limited to the users themselves,  but  seriously  affecting  others
    they rob, burgle and otherwise steal from to feed their  habit.  It  is
    not hard to sympathize with simple users; but this appellant, according
    to the sentencing judge, was only a user incidentally to  dealing.  The
    judge, having heard the  evidence  on  which  the  jury  convicted  the
    appellant, did not find it necessary to go into too much  detail  about
    what he had done. However, the length of  the  sentence  passed,  about
    twice what an ordinary street dealer might expect, and  the  amount  of
    ill-gotten money found in the appellant's possession, show that he  was
    no common pedlar.

29. The appellant himself acknowledged that the jury's verdict  had  to  be
    respected; but he still kept up his denial of any guilt  beyond  simple
    possession of cocaine. Mr Behbahani suggested that I should not  attach
    too much importance to this; and certainly the appellant has served his
    sentence, and is in a way appealingly straightforward in  his  view  of
    the events which had led to it. However, I am not  now  concerned  with
    punishing him, but with whether the public interest requires him to go.
    The real difficulty for someone who  denies  doing  anything  seriously
    wrong in the first place, but has been convicted of it by  a  jury,  is
    that it is hard to find in his attitude any assurance of real reform of
    the ways in which he had, but denies having gone wrong.

30. The  only  official  source  material  I  have  about  the  appellant's
    prospects of reform is in the very partial OASys assessment (see  13  -
    14). I am not prepared to assume that, because  the  'risk  of  serious
    harm' is assessed as 'low', so also  must  the  risk  of  re-offending:
    though of course the two things are linked, the familiar  full  version
    of the OASys report deals with them as  separate  categories.  It  also
    gives the opportunity for a number of other assessments to be made,  in
    particular about the offender's attitude to his crime.

31. If this appellant had simply been drawn into dealing on the side  by  a
    drug habit of his  own,  then  the  courses  he  undertook  in  prison,
    together with the happy family life he  is  leading  for  the  present,
    might perhaps have given the necessary assurance  of  reform;  but  his
    case is quite different. The evidence, as judged by the  jury  and  the
    sentencing judge, shows on the contrary that  he  dealt  in  drugs  for
    money, and quite serious money at that, and his own use of them was  on
    the side. The easy money to be made by such activity can all too easily
    become a way of life; and, while the appellant's family life might make
    him regret the trouble he has caused them, I am  not  prepared,  having
    heard what he himself says about what he has done, to accept that he is
    more likely than not to turn away from it for the foreseeable future.

32. I have no doubt that the appellant is a loving father to Rey, and would
    be, if he had the chance, to his unborn child; and I  accept  that,  as
    things stand, he is a supportive baby-father to Adisa. While  he  might
    manage, even if he did not turn away from dealing in  future,  to  keep
    his involvement from his children,  the  probabilities,  based  on  the
    events which led to his conviction, are that he would not provide  them
    with a good example, and that he, and they with him would be drawn down
    into misery. That in the end, whatever the present  position  (see  24)
    has to mean that Rey's long-term best interests would not be served  by
    letting the appellant stay in this country.

33. Rey's interests were the strongest consideration against those  of  the
    public,  even  more  strongly  in  favour  of  this  appellant's  being
    deported. It must be quite clear from SS (Nigeria) , even for those who
    did not find it so before, that there is a strong  public  interest  in
    the deportation of anyone  sentenced  even  to  so  little,  relatively
    speaking, as 12 months' imprisonment for a  single  offence.  While  it
    would be a mistake to extrapolate  arithmetically  from  that  to  this
    appellant's six years', both the sentence passed on him, and the nature
    of his offence, show a  very  strong  public  interest  indeed  in  his
    deportation.

34. Though the appellant's present family situation  might  make  a  strong
    claim for him to be allowed to stay with them, if there were  any  real
    assurance of his reform, as things stand  I  do  not  think  it  raises
    anything like the 'very strong claim indeed', required in SS (Nigeria),
    especially when weighed against the gravity of his crimes. I  can  well
    understand why the first-tier panel decided as they did, and I  do  not
    reach my own conclusion with any particular enthusiasm.  The  appellant
    has both charm and intelligence, as one of the  reports  on  him  makes
    clear; Adisa is a very charming and hard-working person  indeed,  while
    Rey from what I have seen of him is a delightful  child.  It  would  be
    very tempting to make them all happy; but, unfortunately  for  them,  I
    have a public duty to do which makes that impossible.
