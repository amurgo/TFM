For the Respondent:    Mr V Jagadeshal, Counsel instructed by Turpin Miller
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal allowing the appeal of the respondent,  hereinafter
    "the claimant", against the decision of the Secretary of  State  on  24
    May 2018 to make her the subject of a deportation order.

 2. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I make an order prohibiting the disclosure or publication  of  any
    matter likely to lead members of the public to identify  the  claimant.
    Breach of this order can be punished as a contempt  of  court.  I  make
    this order because the merits of the case concern the  welfare  of  two
    children who are British citizens, a son who I identify as "F" who  was
    born in July 2003 and so is now 15 years old and a daughter "E" who was
    born in December 2006 and so is now 12 years old.   The  respondent  is
    their mother and is a national of Belgium.  She was born in  July  1976
    and says that she entered the United Kingdom in 1994 when  she  was  18
    years old.

 3. The claimant says that she has lived in the United Kingdom  since  then
    and has been exercising treaty rights. She  is  married  to  a  British
    national and on 3 October 2017 they were each sent to  prison  for  two
    and a half years.  They had  been  convicted  of  cheating  the  public
    revenue.  In simple terms, they had run a business  and  collected  tax
    and national insurance payments that they did  not  forward.   Although
    the offence was a joint  enterprise  this  appellant  had  cheated  the
    public purse out of something in the order of ï¿½254,000.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal allowed the  appeal  out  of  concern  for  the
    claimant's children.

 5. I begin by looking carefully at the First-tier Tribunal's decision  and
    reasons.

 6. The judge noted that the Secretary of State accepted (eventually)  that
    the claimant has a genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship  with
    her children.  It was not accepted that she  had  a  similarly  genuine
    subsisting and relationship with her husband who is a British national.
     According to the First-tier Tribunal Judge, it was not  accepted  that
    it would be "unduly harsh" for the children to move to Belgium to  live
    with their mother or to remain in the  United  Kingdom  and  have  such
    contact with their mother as they could arrange.

 7. The claimant represented herself before the  First-tier  Tribunal.   It
    may be that some of the inconsistencies in her evidence were the result
    of careless preparation rather than an intention to deceive because the
    corrected version appears to have emerged without difficulty during the
    hearing but she had claimed to have had no relationship with her family
    in Belgium and then changed her evidence to say she  had  some  contact
    with her father and brother.

 8. The judge found her an "intelligent, articulate and confident woman".

 9. The judge was particularly interested  in  what  had  happened  to  the
    children.  In anticipation  of  a  prison  sentence  the  claimant  had
    arranged for them to live with their paternal uncle and aunt  but  that
    relationship broke down and the children went into foster care.

10.  The  judge  noted  that  in  the  local  authority's  papers  it   was
    contemplated that the claimant's partner would be released from  prison
    and would live subject to electronic tagging in a place where he  could
    not accommodate the children.  It was the claimant's son's case that he
    "didn't really know" his father.  His father  used  to  stay  with  the
    family most weekends.  He  spent  a  of  time  in  London  running  the
    business.  The judge noted that F had been out of school for  seventeen
    months and his education had suffered.

11. It was said that the children's father had "inconsistent contact" since
    being imprisoned.  There was a long letter from  a  key  social  worker
    stating that the  father  maintained  regular  telephone  and  sporadic
    postal contact  with  the  children.   It  was  the  father's  declared
    intention to move together to a house in Yorkshire after his release.

12. The judge noted that the children do not speak French fluently but  had
    seen school reports indicating the children do  speak  German  although
    she accepted they had only very limited knowledge of Dutch.  The social
    worker was anxious that the children remained in  the  United  Kingdom,
    being of the opinion that "we would like to stress  the  importance  of
    both children to remain in the country of their birth so  as  to  avoid
    any disruptions or possible distress  caused  by  social  dislocation".
    This recommendation was based without regard to the criminality of  the
    mother but solely on the needs of the children.

13. The judge was not satisfied that the claimant had acquired a  right  of
    permanent residence in the United Kingdom.  This appears to be based on
    uncertain evidence about her economic activity.  The  judge  noted  too
    that the children's father was born in 1949 so he will be 70,  in  fact
    very soon.

14. The judge said at paragraph 44:

         "I have assessed the evidence as a whole and having done so I  find
         that the [claimant] has been the  children's  primary  carer  since
         they were very young children.  The children do know their  father,
         but he is a distant figure and does not have a strong  relationship
         with them, being a distant figure  in  their  lives  who  has  only
         visited them in their home once a week from about 2007 onwards when
         they moved to Suffolk with their mother."

15. The judge was not satisfied that there was  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship  between  the  parents.   She  noted  too  the  claimant's
    evidence that their children's father did not feel able to  look  after
    them.  The judge found that he had said different things  at  different
    times about his proposals for the children and concluded that she was:

         "Not satisfied that [the claimant's husband] is committed to caring
         for the children after his release from prison and I accept that he
         has told the [claimant] that he does not think he can care for them
         as he is too old.  His becoming the sole or primary  carer  of  the
         children really  does  not  fit  in  with  his  plans  to  move  to
         Yorkshire.  These children have endured two  changes  of  home  and
         school since last October and  I  find  it  significant  that  [the
         claimant's husband] is not prioritising  trying  to  keep  them  in
         their current school over his plans."

16. The judge noted too that  the  claimant's  husband  had  supported  the
    family financially from the business.

17. The judge found  the  prospects  of  rehabilitation  for  the  claimant
    equally good in the United Kingdom and Belgium but  she  was  satisfied
    that the claimant did present  a  "genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
    serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests  of  society"
    (paragraph 51).  This was based on the  apparent  failure  to  come  to
    terms with the conviction and to accept  responsibility  for  what  had
    happened.

18. At paragraph 53, the judge, rightly, noted that the real issue  in  the
    appeal is whether the decision is proportionate having  regard  to  the
    best interests of the minors.

19. The judge continued at paragraph 56:

         "Social Services have made it very clear  that  they  consider  the
         removal of the two children from the UK to  be  contrary  to  their
         best interests". There was a caveat to this in that  they  did  not
         know the  extent  of  the  criminal  offending,  but  it  would  be
         difficult to avoid finding that a forced move  for  these  children
         would be contrary to their best interests,  given  that  these  two
         children are 14 and 11, are British nationals, were born  here  and
         have never lived in Belgium.  I am satisfied that they  both  speak
         French but speaking it and coping with an  education  system  using
         French and Flemish are two very different things.  They have had to
         endure great upset in their  young  lives  due  entirely  to  their
         parents' behaviour.  They have been removed from school  and  home-
         schooled for a time although I am not satisfied that this was  done
         in a satisfactory way.  They were placed with relatives when  their
         parents were imprisoned and when this did not work out,  they  were
         put into foster care.  Their father is elderly and feels he  cannot
         look after them and while it may seem surprising, given  that  they
         are currently in foster care, the fact remains that  he  has  never
         been their day-to-day carer.  Their mother has been their sole day-
         to-day carer throughout their childhood.  I am satisfied that their
         father is neither willing nor able  to  take  on  their  day-to-day
         care."

20. Mr Mills did not draft the grounds.  To the extent that they  challenge
    the lawfulness of the First-tier Tribunal Judge's conclusion  that  the
    children would not be looked after by their  father,  they  are  wholly
    inept.  It might be thought a poor reflection on the children's  father
    that he did not show more enthusiasm for becoming their carer  but  the
    facts are that he has never been their carer, he is now  70  years  old
    and the children are teenagers.  He has honoured  his  responsibilities
    to the children by providing for them financially but the finding  that
    he had never done much more is plainly open to  the  judge  and  it  is
    unarguable that she was entitled to conclude that  they  would  not  be
    subject to his care.

21. The judge then had to decide whether it was best for the children  that
    their mother remained in the United Kingdom.  She had no hesitation  in
    concluding that it  was.   This  is  completely  uncontroversial.   The
    children have never lived anywhere else  and,  as  has  been  explained
    rather carefully by the judge,  that  had  considerable  disruption  in
    their lives it is very  desirable  that  they  have  no  more  than  is
    necessary.

22. Of course, the clear finding about the best interests of the  child  is
    not determinative of the appeal.  All things  have  to  be  considered.
    The judge, correctly, concerned herself with the proportionality of the
    decision.  She found that the children should not be expected to go and
    live in Belgium.  She did not regard this  as  completely  unthinkable.
    She considered how they might cope and noted they have some language in
    common and of course they would have a supportive mother but the  judge
    was concerned about the disruption they had experienced in  the  recent
    past and noted that all of their understanding and cultural development
    has been in the United Kingdom.  Mr  Jagadeshal  accepted  there  might
    have been room for this issue to have been decided differently but that
    is not the point.  It was decided in the way it was.  Mr Mills properly
    reminded me of the important public interest in removing people who are
    due to be deported and it is plain that the judge only had to  consider
    proportionality because she was satisfied that the appellant was  still
    a risk.

23. The judge's view was that the best interests of the children were clear
    and outweighed the public interest in removing the mother.  I reflected
    carefully on the grounds and Mr Mills' reflective and apt  submissions.
    The fact remains that this is a considered decision where  the  correct
    law was identified and where the public interest  was  clearly  in  the
    mind of the judge.  It was not mentioned in  passing  but  referred  to
    more than once in the decision and was very much in her mind before she
    reached her conclusion.  It is an entirely sensible decision  that  the
    children should not be expected to leave  the  United  Kingdom  and  an
    entirely sensible decision that  their  best  interest  lies  in  their
    mother remaining with them to  give  the  care  and  guidance  that  is
    necessary in their teenage years. The decision  that  removal  was  not
    proportionate and that more weight should be given to the interests  of
    the children than the public interest in removal was a  considered  and
    the conclusion was open to her.

24. It would have been better  if  the  judge  had  referred  expressly  to
    schedule 1 of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016
    but the judge clearly appreciated  the  importance  to  the  public  of
    removing criminals as well as the best interests of the British citizen
    children.  The  offending  involves  dishonesty.  It  does   not   have
    aggravating feature of involving particularly abhorrent crimes  such  a
    trafficking or drug abuse  and  it  is  not  international  crime.  The
    relationship with the  children  was  not  forged  cynically  when  the
    claimant  could  have  expected  her  conduct  to  have  attracted  the
    attention of the authorities.

25. All in all, I find no material error of law in the decision.

    Notice of Decision

    There is no error of law here and I dismiss the  Secretary  of  State's
    appeal against the First-tier Tribunal's decision.
