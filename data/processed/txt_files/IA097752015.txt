Representation:
For the claimant: Mr A Khan, instructed by Bukhari Chambers Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Row  promulgated  20.7.15,  allowing   the
    claimant's appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State, dated
    23.2.15, to refuse her application  made  on  24.12.14  for  indefinite
    leave to remain in the UK as the victim of domestic violence,  pursuant
    to paragraph 289A of the Immigration Rules and to remove her  from  the
    UK pursuant to section 47 of the Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act
    2006. The Judge heard the appeal on 16.7.15.

 2. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Grant  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    23.10.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 16.2.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. I found such error of law in the making of the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal as to require the decision of Judge Row to be set  aside,
    and remitted the making of the decision in the appeal to be made afresh
    in the  First-tier  Tribunal.  Having  indicated  my  decision  at  the
    hearing, I reserved my reasons, which I now give.

 5. The relevant background can be briefly summarised as follows. Following
    her marriage to her cousin, the claimant arrived in the UK on 30.10.12.
    Her marriage broke down during her probationary  leave  period  and  in
    fact within 5 months of arrival. She left her husband in March 2013 and
    went to live with her sister. She claims to have  been  the  victim  of
    domestic violence, including being slapped and burnt with  a  cigarette
    on two occasions. No divorce proceedings were instituted and in January
    2015 she began to live with another man, also a relation, and  was  due
    to give birth to their child in November 2015.

 6. In summary, the single ground of application for permission  to  appeal
    submits that in the absence of evidence to satisfy the requirements  of
    the Rules, the claimant failed to discharge the burden of proof on  her
    and the judge erred in finding the claimant was a  victim  of  domestic
    violence.

 7. In granting permission to  appeal  Judge  Grant  noted  that  paragraph
    289A(iii) of the Immigration Rules requires  the  claimant  to  produce
    evidence that the relationship was caused to break down as a result  of
    domestic violence. The claimant produced GP notes showing that she  had
    reported domestic violence many months after the allege event and there
    was no examination or other  independent  evidence.  The  Secretary  of
    State submits that this is not direct  evidence  but  no  more  than  a
    recital of what the claimant told her GP, and which would  be  entirely
    consistent with her laying the foundation for a claim to remain on  the
    grounds of domestic violence.

 8. The medical notes show that she visited her GP on 26.8.14 and  reported
    cigarette burns. The GP did not record seeing any scars or marks, which
    is significant when it is well known that a cigarette burn  leave  very
    distinctive scaring. There were further visits on 29.9.14 and 18.11.14,
    in which the claimant also asserted having been the victim of  domestic
    violence. However, she left her husband in March  2013  and  the  first
    report to the GP was not until some 17 months later.

 9. More significantly, it is clear from �19 through to �22 of the decision
    that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  was  not  satisfied  about  the
    claimant's  assertions  of  domestic  violence.  The  judge   expressed
    "reservations" about the evidence of the claimant and her  sister.  The
    judge did not accept the claimant's account of when she first began  to
    live with her present partner and  concluded  that  both  she  and  her
    sister were not telling the truth. The  judge  considered  the  medical
    notes,  stating  at  �22  that,  "I  am  not  convinced  that   it   is
    corroboration. The judge noted that  she  had  seen  her  GP  on  three
    previous occasions after the supposed date of the domestic violence and
    yet never mentioned it on any of those occasions.

10. At �23, the judge considered that the GP visit in  August  2014,  three
    months before her application was submitted, "gives the impression that
    she saw her GP then for the purpose  of  establishing  a  reference  to
    domestic violence on  the  medical  records  which  could  be  used  to
    corroborate her case."

11. Despite those findings and reservations, the judge went on  at  �24  to
    observe that the fact that the claimant and her sister  may  have  been
    less than honest about the nature of her relationship with her  present
    partner, "does not necessarily mean that she is lying about having been
    assaulted. Nor does the fact that  she  may  have  visited  her  GP  to
    establish a record of domestic violence mean that no domestic  violence
    had taken place."

12. Whilst the judge was  in  effect  right  to  keep  an  open  mind,  the
    difficulty with the decision is that at �26 the judge departed entirely
    from the evidence and in effect speculated, stating,  "Something  cause
    the breakdown of the marriage," and at �28 and continuing in �29,  "The
    appellant had been with her husband for less than five months.  In  her
    circumstances it must have been  something  drastic  which  caused  the
    separation.  The  marriage  had  broken  down   quickly.   The   likely
    explanation I find I that the appellant is telling the truth about  the
    domestic violence she was subjected to and that this was the  cause  of
    the breakdown of the marriage."

13. On the findings of the judge, there is  no  evidential  basis  for  the
    conclusion  reached;  it  is  entirely  speculation  to  suggest   that
    "something" must have caused the breakdown of the marriage and then  to
    conclude that that something must be domestic violence; there  are,  of
    course, many other reasons for the breakdown of such relationship.  The
    claimant's credibility had been undermined, she had been disbelieved on
    elements of her claim, there was a lack of independent evidence, and an
    apparent attempt to shore up the claim by making very  late  claims  to
    her GP of domestic violence, despite having failed to mention the  same
    when making earlier visits to the same doctor.  The  judge  appears  to
    excuse the absence of evidence in �24  and  �25.  The  reasoning  cited
    provides inadequate and flawed justification for the conclusion reached
    by the First-tier Tribunal Judge. It would, in theory, have  been  open
    to the judge to reach a conclusion that the claimant is truthful  about
    domestic violence, but the way  in  which  the  decision  was  made  is
    perverse and amounts to an error of law such that the  decision  cannot
    stand and must be set aside. As the judge did not  go  on  to  consider
    whether there were any compelling  circumstances  to  justify  granting
    leave to remain outside the Rules  on  the  basis  of  article  8  ECHR
    private and/or family life, it was not possible to conclude the  appeal
    by simply remaking the decision in the Upper Tribunal.

14. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts are  unclear  on  a
    crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of  those  issues.
    The errors of the First-tier Tribunal Judge vitiates all other findings
    of fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been
    a valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

15. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties
    to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I
    do so on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within  the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  nature  or
    extent of any judicial fact finding which is necessary for the decision
    in the appeal to  be  re-made  is  such  that,  having  regard  to  the
    overriding objective to deal with cases fairly  and  justly,  including
    with the avoidance of delay, I find that it  is  appropriate  to  remit
    this appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusions:

16. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside  to  be  remade
    afresh, with no findings of fact preserved.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the making of the decision in the appeal to  the
                    First-tier Tribunal.

    fact preserved;

18. It may be  listed  before  any  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,  with  the
    exception of Judge Row and Judge EB Grant;

19. There will be two witnesses in addition to the claimant;

20. The estimated length of hearing is 2 hours;

21. An interpreter in Urdu will be required;

22. Not less than 14 working days before the relisted appeal  hearing,  the

    Documents produced on the day of the hearing will not be accepted.


Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be decided.
