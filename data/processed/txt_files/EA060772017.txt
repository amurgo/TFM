For the Appellant:     Mr Lourdes instructed by JML Solicitors.

For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a national of Ghana born on 20th May 1986 and  he  was
    granted permission to appeal against a decision of First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Monson,  promulgated  on  28th  December  2018.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  dismissed  an  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State dated 14th June 2017 which refused  his  application
    for permanent residence as the former spouse of Ms A L A on  the  basis
    that he had not provided evidence of  a  retained  right  of  residence
    further to Regulation 10(5) and 15(1)(f) of the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2016.

 2. The Secretary of State refused the application  for  a  residence  card
    because he had not shown that his EEA  national  former  spouse  was  a
    qualified person  or  had  permanent  residence  on  the  date  of  the
    termination of the marriage.  He had also failed  to  demonstrate  that
    between him and his sponsor he had collectively exercised Treaty rights
    for a continuous period of five years.  The information provided within
    his application to the Secretary of State  relating  to  the  sponsor's
    exercise of treaty rights ran to the  27th  February  2014  only.   The
    documents  indicated  earnings  from  April  2011  onwards  and   'your
    sponsor's  employment  is  then  comprehensively   documented   (across
    payslips, P 45s, P 60s, bank statements, and  employer  correspondence)
    continuously to the point of a final  payment  made  on  27th  February
    2014'.  The Secretary  of  State  therefore  recognised  the  sponsor's
    exercise of Treaty rights between 6th  April  2011  and  27th  February
    2014. The Secretary of State identified that the covering  letter  with
    the application indicated that the sponsor thereafter  moved  to  self-
    employment but no financial evidence nor any other information relating
    to the self-employment had been supplied  with  the  application  other
    than an HMRC letter dated 10th June 2014 indicating that  his  sponsors
    registration as self-employed had failed due to  an  incomplete  online
    application.  As the reasons for refusal  letter  noted,  the  covering
    letter with the application identified that the  appellant  lived  with
    his ex-wife up to the point of divorce and the point of  divorce  began
    only from the date they submitted their divorce petition. The Secretary
    of State concluded that it was therefore reasonable to expect him to be
    able to provide sufficient documentation to  evidence  how  his  former
    spouse was exercising treaty rights until that same point January 2015.
     Documentation such as joint BT billing continued to the point  of  the
    sponsor's petition for divorce.

 3. In the determination the First-tier Tribunal judge recorded that

    (i)    the evidence before him comprised the bundle of documents  filed
    by the Home Office, the bundle of documents filed  by  the  appellant's
    solicitors and a witness statement from I L of HMRC dated 30th November
    2018 which had been produced pursuant to an 'Amos'  direction  made  by
    the Tribunal on 18 June 2018.

    (ii)   the appellant married his EEA national sponsor on  20th  January
    2011, and he was issued with a five-year residence card on  6  December
    2011 which was valid until the 6th December 2016. The divorce  petition
    was issued on 15th January 2015 and the decree absolute granted  on  23
    October 2015

    (iii)  Mr I L of the HMRC in his witness statement confirmed

         (a)      there was no HMRC self-assessment tax record held for  the
         sponsor

         (b)      there was no  employment  record  held  by  HMRC  for  the
         sponsor for the tax year ending April 2015 or the tax  year  ending
         in 2016

         (c)      between 6th of April 2013 and 21st April 2014 the  sponsor
         earned �4813.20.

         (d)      between 6th of April  2013  and  5th  of  April  2014  the
         sponsor earned nothing as an employee Bayleaf Cleaning Ltd

    (iv)   the judge found the appellant had not discharged the  burden  of
    proving that his ex-spouse was exercising the right at  the  time  that
    she all the appellant filed the divorce  in  January  2015  (Baigazieva
    [2018] EWCA Civ 1088)

    (v)    the earliest evidence of the sponsor  exercising  treaty  rights
    was from April 2011 and therefore it followed she had  not  shown  that
    she had acquired permanent residence by 21 February 2014.  There was no
    evidence of any meaningful economic activity on her part after February
    2014 and the appellant and the sponsor had only been married  for  just
    over 3 years

    (vi)   The ex-spouse had not been shown to be exercising treaty  rights
    from 21st February 2014 and thus the appellant was not able to show  he
    qualified for a permanent right of residence either on the  basis  that
    he had resided in accordance with  the  EEA  regulations  for  5  years
    continuously or on the basis that collectively he and the  sponsor  had
    exercised Treaty rights over a continuous period of 5 years.

Application for Permission to Appeal


 4. The application for  permission  made  stated  that  the  determination
    contained material errors of law, specifically that the Tribunal,  when
    requesting information from HMRC in response to  the  'Amos'  direction
    cited the wrong National Insurance number for the spouse.  The  witness
    statement from I L recorded an NI number which 'may have used  briefly'
    (sic) until the acquiring of another number as quoted in the letter  of
    7th  June  2018.   The  Tribunal  had  erred  in  law  in  taking  this
    information into account and had not followed the  direction  contained
    in Rule 4 of the Tribunal Procedure Rules.  Further the Tribunal should
    have found that the Respondent in this case had not  ensured  that  the
    Section 40 of the United Kingdom Borders Act 2007 'conditions' had been
    followed by HMRC.  The Tribunal had erred in law in not  spotting  that
    the  NI  number  mentioned  on  7th  June  2018  'is  matching  in  the
    information that has been submitted in the  statement  from  the  HMRC'
    (sic). J2 (a previous P60 of the ex-spouse) in the bundle  demonstrated
    that the NI number of the spouse was SJ ** ** 31 A.

The Hearing

 5. At the hearing Mr Lourdes submitted that there were two NI numbers  for
    the spouse and that the Tribunal  direction  had  not  reflected  this.
    Hence the information from the HMRC was incomplete and this  the  judge
    had not taken into account.

 6. Mr Melvin submitted that the HMRC record  did  indeed  reflect  the  NI
    numbers.

 7. When I suggested that the Tribunal had made a direction  in  accordance
    with the request and letter  of  the  appellant's  previous  solicitors
    Elegant Law, Mr Lourdes submitted that  the  appellant  should  not  be
    visited with the faults of the solicitors.



Conclusions

 8. The First-tier Tribunal set out the key  issue  which  is  whether  the
    appellant's former spouse had been exercising treaty rights for 5 years
    by the date of divorce or  whether  the  appellant  had  shown  he  had
    retained rights of  residence  through  demonstrating  the  spouse  was
    exercising Treaty rights at January 2015, the point of divorce.   There
    was no evidence that the former  spouse  had  exercised  Treaty  rights
    prior to 2011 and the marriage only took place in 2011.   The  relevant
    timescales were addressed by the judge.

 9. The former solicitors acting for the appellant, until  the  application
    for permission to appeal, namely Elegant Solicitors,  made  a  specific
    request for the 'Amos' Direction in a letter to the Tribunal dated  7th
    June 2018.  In that letter the NI number given for the spouse was SK **
    ** 56 B.  The correct full name of the spouse and her date of birth was
    given.  There was no dispute as to those details.  Subsequently it  was
    argued that the documentation at J2 of the bundle showed that there was
    an alternative NI number (given above).   Not  only  did  the  Tribunal
    carry out the request for a direction in  the  form  requested  by  the
    former  legal  representatives  and  there  was  no  evidence  of   any
    complaint, but the HMRC made no reference to either  NI  number  given.
    There can be no criticism of the  Tribunal  failing  to  undertake  the
    request properly and thus of the judge for taking into account the HMRC
    witness statement.

10. The witness statement from the HMRC clearly set out the  full  name  of
    the spouse and her date of birth. The  search  was  conducted  on  that
    basis and the only number given was  that  which  was  described  as  a
    temporary NI number  'used  for  HMRC  purposes  only';  that  bore  no
    relation to either of the two NI numbers given for  the  ex-spouse  and
    was apparently for HMRC purposes only.   The Pay as you Earn Tax record
    for the spouse for 2013-2014 referred in the 'tax year record'  to  two
    companies 'Bayleaf Cleaning Ltd' for which no income was  recorded  but
    also Supervision Assured Ltd and identified that the former spouse  had
    earned �4813.20 between' 06-04-2013 and  21-02-2014'.   This,  however,
    was the company which issued the P60 and used NI number SJ ** ** 31  A,
    at J2 of the respondent's bundle and  the  same  NI  number  which  the
    Tribunal or  Judge  was  supposed  to  have  spotted.   This  employer,
    Supervision Assured Ltd, did use the NI number which  it  was  asserted
    should have been used and referenced by the Tribunal.  This record  was
    therefore detected by HMRC and correlates with the records supplied  by
    the Home Office and with the alternative  NI  number.  Thus,  the  HMRC
    accessed the records for the ex-spouse in relation to both NI  numbers.
    The witness statement also records that for the tax years 2014-2015 and
    2015 and 2016 there was 'no employment record held'.

11. As the First-tier Tribunal Judge found, there was no evidence that  the
    former spouse had acquired permanent residence, there was no record  of
    any economic activity prior to 2011 and there was no indication of  any
    economic activity or exercise of Treaty rights by the ex-spouse at  the
    point of divorce. The only evidence in relation to self-employment  was
    a letter of 10th June 2014 indicating that his  sponsor's  registration
    as self-employed had failed due to an  incomplete  online  application.
    Indeed, the Secretary of State noted that the documentation provided by
    the appellant indicated joint billing beyond the date of divorce.

12. Mr  Lourdes  tried  to  persuade  me  that,  in  the  alternative,  the
    respondent should have sought evidence in relation to  the  appellant's
    former wife being a jobseeker. That was not raised  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal and Amos v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 552 is not authority  for
    the shifting of  the  burden  of  proof  to  the  respondent  from  the
    appellant. Paragraph 40 of Amos explains that it is for  the  appellant
    to seek the relevant directions for a witness summons  or  a  direction
    requiring the Secretary of State to provide any information necessary.

13. The request made to the Tribunal was for  tax  records  from  HMRC  not
    information from any other department  about  Jobseeking  status  which
    would no doubt emanate from the Department  of  Work  and  Pensions  (a
    different department).   Even if that were the case, which it was  not,
    as stated at paragraph 42 of Amos:

         '42.  The  context  in  Kerr  was  social  security   rather   than
         immigration, a relevant distinction, as appears from  the  citation
         from Diplock J and Baroness Hale's conclusion  from  it.  Even  so,
         Baroness Hale was careful to limit her comments to information held
         by the department in  question.  Kerr  is  not  authority  for  the
         proposition that the Department for Social Development of  Northern
         Ireland, the appellant in the appeal, was under any duty to  obtain
         information  available   to   other   government   departments   or
         authorities. Even if transposed to the present context, it  is  not
         authority for the proposition that the Home Secretary is  bound  to
         make enquiries of other government departments  for  evidence  they
         may or may not have concerning issues before the Tribunal'

14. I find no legal error in the judge's assessment of the evidence nor  in
    his conclusions which were reasoned and thorough. There was no error on
    the part of the Tribunal in the request.  The decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal will stand.  Mr Ansah's appeal remains dismissed.
