               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Molyneux, instructed by Global Immigration
Solutions
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge J W  H  Law,  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent to refuse a human  rights  claim  consequent
    upon a decision to deport him pursuant  to  Section  32(5)  of  the  UK
    Borders Act 2007.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Algeria who arrived in the United Kingdom
    at the age of 12 in 2002.  He accompanied his father who claimed asylum
    with the appellant as his dependant.  That application was  refused  as
    was an application made by the appellant in his own  name  in  December
    2004.

 3. In May 2006 the  appellant  was  convicted  of  robbery  for  which  he
    received a sentence of five years and six months in  prison.   Although
    an appeal against deportation was dismissed in 2009, the  decision  was
    eventually withdrawn in February 2013 as the appellant wished to make a
    further decision under the UK Borders  Act  2007  consequent  upon  the
    conviction of the appellant on 3 October 2011 for robbery in possession
    of a shotgun to which he was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence  of
    imprisonment for public protection with a minimum  term  to  be  served
    before consideration of release of 90 months.

 4. The appellant has never had leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  but
    he does have a son born in 2011 who lives with his  mother.   There  is
    limited contact between the appellant and his son.

 5. The respondent's case is that, given  the  appellant's  sentence  to  a
    period of over four years, his deportation was conducive to the  public
    good and in  the  public  interest,  there  being  no  very  compelling
    circumstances over and above  those  described  in  the  Exceptions  to
    deportation set out at paragraphs  399  and  399A  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 6. The respondent  did  not  consider  that  there  were  very  compelling
    circumstances in this case given a lack  of  evidence  as  to  why  any
    family and or private life  could  not  be  continued  in  Algeria  and
    because he had not shown that there were significant obstacles  to  his
    integration into Algeria or that he had made any positive  contribution
    to British society.  The Secretary of State did not accept  that  there
    was any  genuine  and  subsisting  parental  relationship  between  the
    appellant and his son noting that the relationship  was  limited  to  a
    current court ordered ad hoc telephone conversation which  had  stopped
    in 2012.  It was also  noted  that  the  appellant's  parents,  sister,
    brother, niece, two nephews and a cousin were in the United Kingdom.

 7. The judge heard evidence  from  the  appellant,  his  mother,  and  his
    sister, finding that:

      i) the appellant has limited  family  life  with  his  son  which  was
         necessarily restricted as they had not met since 2014 and they  had
         been only in prison before that [33];

     ii) although there was a prospect of that  family  life  being  further
         developed if the appellant remained in  the  United  Kingdom  after
         release, whether that would take  place  depended  largely  on  the
         attitude of the child's mother as the existing family  court  order
         allows direct contact between the child and the appellant  only  if
         she had agreed to it, her failure to provide her own  statement  to
         the effect that she would  allow  further  contact  in  the  future
         raised some doubt as to her seriousness;

    iii) there was no family life between the appellant and  his  mother  or
         older sister;

     iv) there was a lack of evidence as to whether the appellant  has  been
         well integrated into his local community, it being conceded he  had
         not been lawfully resident in the UK for most of his life [35];

      v) the OASys assessment in November 2016 described him as presenting a
         high risk of harm to the public and community  and  enumerated  his
         offences whilst in prison [36];

     vi) the current psychiatric report of Dr Chahl indicated the  appellant
         has a personality disorder  rather  than  any  others  which  could
         respond to treatment  and/or  counselling;  that  therapy  will  on
         balance only have limited impact and, that there was no  supporting
         evidence to the suggestion that this therapy would not be available
         in Algeria;

    vii) Dr Chahl believed there to be a  high  risk  of  self-harm  if  the
         appellant were deported  to  Algeria,  noting  the  prison  medical
         records indicating that there had been self-harm  in  the  past  as
         recently as September 2017 [38];

   viii) it would not be unduly harsh for the child to remain in the  United
         Kingdom without the appellant [41] it being noted the appellant had
         made no attempt to resume contact with a child until  after  served
         with a notice of intention to deport in September 2016; that  there
         were no very compelling circumstances in the case; that he was  not
         satisfied  there   were   any   very   significant   obstacles   to
         reintegration into Algeria, applying Kamara [2016]  EWCA  Civ  813;
         and, no reason had been put forward as to why the  appellant  could
         not live with his grandmother and be supported  by  her  and  other
         relatives whilst he is finding a way of establishing himself;

     ix) medication and treatment the appellant might receive if he remained
         in  the  United  Kingdom  would  have  a  limited  impact  on   his
         personality disorder which was the apparent cause of the  self-harm
         and thus there is a risk of  him  continuing  to  self-harm  if  he
         remained in the United Kingdom [44];

      x) bearing in mind the strong public interest  in  deportation,  there
         were no very compelling circumstances in the appellant's favour.

 8. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had erred:-

      i) In making  findings  that  the  appellant  could  be  supported  by
         relatives in Algeria which was contrary  to  the  evidence  of  the
         appellant's  mother;  and,  in  speculating  that  the  appellant's
         brother visits Algeria, these errors  vitiating  finding  that  the
         appellant would have adequate support on return in the light of his
         mental health difficulties or traumatic past;

     ii) in failing to note Dr Chahl's conclusion that if the  appellant  is
         deported back to Algeria his prognosis will be much worse which may
         have led  to  conclusion  that  this  constitutes  very  compelling
         circumstances;

    iii)  in  failing  to  have  regard  to  other  material  evidence  when
         considering whether there were very compelling  circumstances  such
         that deportation would be disproportionate.

 9. On 2 July 2019 Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb granted permission on grounds
    1 and 2 but refused permission on ground 3.

10.  I  heard  submissions  from  both  representatives.   In  summary,  Mr
    Molyneux's argument is that taking together both of the errors,  it  is
    arguable that the judge erred in that were the  appellant  without  any
    means of support in Algeria and to be at risk of self-harm, this  could
    amount to very compelling circumstances.

11. I accept that the judge did not have regard to and, did not explain why
    he did not accept the evidence  of  the  appellant's  mother  that  the
    family in Algeria were unable to support him and there was nowhere  for
    him to stay.  I accept also that  the  findings  with  respect  to  the
    appellant's brother are speculative and not grounded in evidence.

12. That, however, is not necessarily material.  This is an appeal in which
    it was for the  appellant  to  show  that  there  are  very  compelling
    circumstances over and above those set out in Exceptions 1 and 2.   The
    judge properly directed himself with respect to that at [24].

13. The case law requires a  Tribunal  to  consider  first  whether  either
    Exception 1 or Exception 2 are met in assessing whether there  are,  in
    the case of a serious offender, that is one sentence which is more than
    four years - see NA (Pakistan) at [30].

14. Turning to Exception 1, it cannot be said that the applicant  has  been
    lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most of his life.   On  the
    contrary, for the greater amount of the time he has not  been  lawfully
    here and has spent a substantial length of time in prison.  Further, it
    could not rationally  be  said  that  he  is  socially  and  culturally
    integrated into the United Kingdom given that he has not been  educated
    here on his own evidence and has  committed  a  significant  number  of
    serious offences which has resulted in him being sentenced to terms  of
    imprisonment firstly for five years  and  six  months  and  then  to  a
    sentence with a minimum term of 90 months which was committed whilst he
    was on licence and in which the sentencing judge  made  it  clear  that
    were it not a case in which he was imposing that "if I were  passing  a
    determinate sentence upon the [appellant]... it would be a sentence  of
    fifteen years' imprisonment."  Over and above the relationship with his
    son, on no rational view of the facts as found could it  be  said  that
    the appellant is socially and culturally  integrated  into  the  United
    Kingdom.

15. In order for Exception 1 to be met, all three of the criteria  must  be
    met cumulatively.  For these reasons, even were  it  shown  that  there
    were very significant obstacles to his  integration  into  Algeria,  he
    would  nonetheless  be  very  far  from  showing  that  he  met   those
    exceptions.

16. Turning to  the  issue  of  the  appellant's  self-harming,  the  first
    observation is that a low suicide risk is identified.  It  is  observed
    from the report at [58] that as at  the  date  of  interview  the  last
    attempt at self-harm was a year previously it being observed that

         "He showed me scars on his left and right arm and also his abdomen.
          His abdomen was covered in scars  from  lacerations  that  he  had
         made.  The wound seems to have healed well and were  therefore  not
         recent.  He stated sometimes he gets too much for me and  I  can't'
         cope, Mr [L] told me that his self-harm  and  the  sight  of  blood
         gives him a sense of relief and it is sometimes a cry for help."

    It is also noted that [59] he told me that he  had  settled  relatively
    well in his current  prison  since  he  had  become  close  to  another
    prisoner who he  described  as  his  cellmate.   He  stated  that  this
    individual had been very supportive towards him.  Mr [L] said  that  he
    hears voices inside his head and sometimes wakes up screaming.   That's
    why I have not self-harmed because I have someone to talk to."

17. Having diagnosed a  mixed  personality  disorder  with  dis-social  and
    emotionally unstable personality features Dr Chahl reached a  prognosis
    that the personality disorder is lifelong, unlikely to  be  subject  to
    significant change.  It concluded  that  the  case  of  deportation  to
    Algeria and the risk of self-harm will be high but  that  the  risk  of
    suicide is likely to be low.  He was  pessimistic  about  psychological
    interventions working with the personality disorder and  the  prognosis
    it deported is as follows:

         "There is little doubt if Mr [L] is deported back  to  Algeria  his
         prognosis will be much worse.  He is likely to  struggle  with  yet
         another trauma of having to start life in a country (Algeria) where
         he has not spent any time as an adult.  His son is  a  UK  national
         and on his return to Algeria it is unlikely that  Mr  [L]  will  be
         allowed to return to the UK."

18. It was open to the judge to conclude that the appellant's condition  is
    one which can cure them while there was a risk of continuing  self-harm
    if he remained in the United Kingdom.   Equally,  the  judge  concluded
    that it was likely that there would be further self-harm on deportation
    [46] but concluded that these  would  not  amount  to  very  compelling
    circumstances. That was a finding open to him on the evidence, and  for
    which he gave adequate and sustainable reasons.

19. It has to be appreciated that even if  the  circumstances  were  unduly
    harsh, and that is a high threshold that would not be enough. While the
    prognosis for the appellant was that his situation would be fare  worse
    but the judge was entitled to conclude that taking that with the  other
    findings, there would be no factors such that exception  1  or  2  were
    met; or that there were no very compelling circumstances.

20. Further, the factors in this case are a long way from establishing  the
    high threshold to engage Article 3.  The risk of suicide  is  described
    as low and his self-harming does not reach that level.

21. For the sake of completeness, although  the  grounds  do  not  directly
    challenge the finding that the appellant's separation  from  his  child
    would not be unduly harsh, given the limited contact  with  the  child,
    the judge was manifestly entitled to conclude that this was so. Viewing
    the lack of contact it cannot be said that this was a case in which the
    relevant exception might be met.

22. In reality ground 2 is a disagreement with the judge's  findings.   The
    judge accepted that there was a  risk  of  self-harm  but  nevertheless
    considered that this was not a very compelling circumstance even  taken
    into account with the others.  That was clearly a finding open  to  the
    judge and for which he gave adequate and sustainable reasons.

23. Further, in MS (s.117C(6): "very compelling circumstances") Philippines
    [2019] UKUT 122 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal said this:

         "In determining pursuant to section  117C(6)  of  the  Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 whether there are  very  compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2
         in subsections (4) and (5), such as to outweigh the public interest
         in the deportation of a foreign criminal, a court or tribunal  must
         take into account, together with any other relevant public interest
         considerations, the seriousness of the particular offence of  which
         the foreign criminal was convicted; not merely whether the  foreign
         criminal was or was not sentenced to imprisonment of  more  than  4
         years. Nothing in KO (Nigeria) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
         Department [2018] UKSC 53 demands a contrary conclusion."

24. In his sentencing remarks the  judge:  described  the  offence  as  "an
    extremely serious offence" in which the appellant and others burgled  a
    farm and  threatened  the  78  year  old  farmer,  stealing  money  and
    firearms; found that the  appellant  presents  a  significant  risk  of
    serious  harm  to  the  public;  and,  concluded  that  a  sentence  of
    imprisonment for public protection was necessary. In the circumstances,
    and given that the offence was committed while  the  appellant  was  on
    licence for an earlier offence for which he was sentenced to 5 � years'
    imprisonment, there was inevitably a  strong  public  interest  in  his
    deportation, and the judge was clearly entitled to conclude it was  not
    outweighed.

25. Accordingly, I am not satisfied the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    involved the making of an error of law and I uphold it.

Notice of Decision

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of
    an error of law and I uphold it
