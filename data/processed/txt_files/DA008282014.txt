                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal to the Upper Tribunal by the Appellant in relation to
    a Decision and Reasons of First-tier Tribunal Judge Brown,  promulgated
    on 19th November 2014 following a  hearing  at  Taylor  House  on  13th
    November 2014.

 2. The facts of the case are that the Appellant, now 25 years  old,  is  a
    citizen of Jamaica.  He came to the UK as quite a young child in  1996.
    Initially he had no leave but he was granted Indefinite Leave to Remain
    in 2002.  In January 2007, when he  was  17ï¿½  approximately,  at  Inner
    London Crown Court he was convicted of wounding with  intent  to  cause
    grievous bodily harm and sentenced to six years' detention in  a  young
    offenders institution.  There were also two warnings  recorded  against
    him on previous occasions but those are not  particularly  relevant  to
    these proceedings.

 3. As a result of that conviction the Secretary of State made  a  Decision
    to deport him.  That Decision was made under the 1971 Act under Section
    3(5)(a) on the basis that his deportation was conducive to  the  public
    good.  It was not made under the UK Borders Act 2007,  Section  32  and
    quite simply the reason for that is because as the Appellant was  under
    the age of 18 at the date of conviction the Secretary of  State   could
    not invoke that procedure because of Section 33(3).

 4. The Appellant's appeal against the Decision  to  deport  him  was  that
    which came before Judge Brown and it is his  Decision  to  dismiss  the
    appeal which is under challenge today.  The grounds seeking  permission
    to appeal are three in number.  I shall take them  in  the  order  they
    appear in the grounds  rather  than  the  order  that  they  have  been
    addressed today.

 5. The first ground argues that the Judge failed to properly consider  the
    exceptions in Section 117C of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002 as it has been amended by Section 19 of  the  Immigration  Act
    2014.  The grounds argue that because the Appellant has been in the  UK
    for most of his life and integrated into the UK there  are  significant
    obstacles to his removal and therefore  the  appeal  should  have  been
    allowed.  The grounds say that it is clear from the facts of  the  case
    and from the arguments put forward that he had spent most of  his  life
    in the UK, coming at the tender age of 5 (7 in the  determination)  and
    has not left the UK since.  The grounds also say it is clear that there
    would be significant obstacles to his family life continuing in Jamaica
    which has been proved on the balance of probabilities.

 6. Before me it was argued that there were very  compelling  circumstances
    in this case on the basis that the Appellant has spent most of his life
    here, that he has no connection whatsoever to  Jamaica,  that  all  his
    contacts are in the UK and that it would be unduly harsh for him to  be
    deported.  He said there were insurmountable obstacles to his  starting
    life over in Jamaica.  It would be difficult for him to find a job.  He
    would not have means to survive whereas here he has a livelihood.   His
    partner, he argued, because she was a  recognised  refugee  from  Syria
    prior to being granted British citizenship, would be unable to live  in
    Jamaica with him.

 7. There are a number of difficulties  with  the  claims  with  regard  to
    Section  117C.   Section  117  has  to  be  taken  into  account   when
    considering proportionality.  Section 117B contains matters which  have
    to be taken into account in every case and Section  117C  contains  the
    additional factors that must be taken  into  account  when  looking  at
    deportation.  Section 117C also distinguishes between deportation of  a
    foreign criminal  who  has  committed  an  offence  for  which  he  was
    sentenced to less than two years, more than two  years  and  more  than
    four years.

 8. For a foreign criminal who has been sentenced  to  in  excess  of  four
    years there is a very stringent test and we are  told  in  the  Statute
    that the public interest requires deportation  unless  there  are  very
    compelling circumstances over and above those that are described in the
    two exceptions.  The first exception (s.117C(4)) which Mr  Ibhakgbemien
    argued applied is that (a) the Appellant had been lawfully resident  in
    the UK for most of his life, (b) is socially and culturally  integrated
    in the UK and (c) there would be  very  significant  obstacles  to  the
    Appellant's integration into his home country.

 9. In this case (a) and (b) are clearly  satisfied.   The  issue  is  (c);
    whether there  are  very  significant  obstacles,  not  obstacles,  not
    significant  obstacles,  but  very   significant   obstacles   to   his
    integration.  That is a very different test than saying that it is  not
    fair or it is harsh to remove him because he is used to life  here;  he
    is settled here.  The issue is whether he can integrate in Jamaica  and
    the Judge in the Decision refers to the following facts:- the Appellant
    is of Jamaican origin;  he has a brother in Jamaica  who  he  does  not
    believe the family has lost contact with; he is young and  healthy;  he
    has been working in the UK  and there is no reason why he could not  do
    so in Jamaica;  he speaks the language. The Judge found  there  are  no
    significant obstacles and  certainly  no  very  significant  obstacles.
    Thus even had he been sentenced to less than  four  years  imprisonment
    the exception contained in s.117C(4) would not have availed him.  As he
    has been sentenced to more than  four  years  he  would  have  to  show
    factors over and above those contained  in  the  exception.  There  are
    none.

10. The second exception (s.117C(5)), although before me the two have  been
    conflated together, relates to a relationship with a qualifying partner
    or a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship  with  a  qualifying
    child and that the effect  of  the  applicant's  deportation  would  be
    unduly harsh, not on the applicant but on the qualifying partner or the
    children.  In this case  they  are  all  qualifying  because  they  are
    British citizens.  However, as the Judge pointed out  in  the  Decision
    the children in this case are very young, the language  in  Jamaica  is
    English, the removal of the Appellant, who  the  Judge  considered  did
    have a genuine relationship with the children, would no doubt be harsh;
    it would not be unduly harsh.  Similarly, whilst  neither  the  partner
    nor children can be required to leave the UK and indeed they  are  not;
    it is a matter of choice for them whether or not  they  go  to  Jamaica
    with him. If they wish to continue family life with  him  there  is  no
    reason why they cannot go to Jamaica.   The  bare  assertion  that  the
    Appellant's partner cannot go to Jamaica because she was a refugee from
    Syria has no merit whatsoever.  She  is  a  British  citizen;  she  can
    travel; she can make application to remain with  her  Jamaican  partner
    and the children. The children may  well  also  be  Jamaican  citizens.
    There is no error of law in relation to Section 117.

11. Although not referred to in the grounds, reference was made to  Section
    55 before me, no doubt because it was referred to by the Judge granting
    permission.  Section 55 of  course  is  a  requirement  that  the  best
    interests  of  the  children  have  to  be  considered  as  a   primary
    consideration.  Section 117 takes that into account because one of  the
    exceptions refers  to  children.   The  Judge  did  not  make  specific
    reference to Section 55.  However, I find that even had he done  so  it
    could have made no difference whatsoever.  Taking it  at  its  highest,
    the best interests of the children in this case require  the  Appellant
    to stay in the UK.  However, taken  cumulatively,  all  of   the  other
    factors, particularly the fact that the Appellant  was sentenced to six
    years imprisonment and therefore was guilty of a very  serious  offence
    required his deportation and  outweighed  the  best  interests  of  the
    children.

12. The second ground on which permission was sought  was  that  the  Judge
    applied the law incorrectly and that the  Secretary  of  State  had  no
    power to deport him under the UK Borders Act 2007 because he was  under
    18 at the date of conviction.  That displays a  breathtaking  ignorance
    of what this case was about because it is quite clear from  the  Letter
    of Refusal that the Secretary of State was well  aware  of  that  fact,
    which is why this was a conducive  deport,  not  one  taken  under  the
    provisions of the UK Borders Act 2007.  There is no error there.

13. Thirdly, there is reference to the Judge making an error of fact in his
    Decision on the basis that he said  that  the  applicant  was  last  in
    Jamaica at age 16 and it is asserted  that  he  has  not  travelled  to
    Jamaica since he came to the UK as a young child.  I find that a rather
    curious assertion because it is clear from the Record of Proceedings of
    the hearing where the same  representative  represented  the  Appellant
    that in cross-examination by the Presenting Officer the Appellant said:
    "Brother deported to Jamaica after  his  conviction.   Mother,  auntie,
    uncle, sister in the UK.  Back to Jamaica when my father died when aged
    16.  Not back since."  That clearly  was  his  evidence  and  therefore
    there is no error in the Judge referring to it.

14. Overall the Judge in this case has taken all the factors  into  account
    which he was required to.  The barrier to climb  for  anyone  convicted
    and sentenced to more than  four  years  is  extremely  high.   Section
    117C(6) makes clear that the existence of children and the  Appellant's
    deportation being unduly harsh on them in itself is not  enough.  There
    is nothing additional about this case that  would  warrant  the  appeal
    being allowed. Therefore I find that there is no material error of  law
    in the Decision and Reasons of the First-tier Tribunal Judge. I  uphold
    the Decision.

15. I would add that the ignorance I refer to at paragraph 12  above  seems
    to have found its  way  into  the  Judge's  mind  as  well  because  at
    paragraph 30 he said that the  deportation  was  correctly  made  under
    Section 32 of the UK Borders Act.  That is a mistake on his part but it
    is absolutely immaterial as at the end of the day  the  deportation  is
    lawful, not having been made under that Act  and  the  error  does  not
    taint the remainder of his findings.

16. For all those reasons the appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
