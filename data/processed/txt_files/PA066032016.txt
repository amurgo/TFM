                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW
Anonymity

  1. The First-tier Tribunal made an  anonymity  order.  I  have  not  been
     invited to rescind that order. The order remains appropriate  as  this
     is a protection claim.

Background

  2. This is an appeal from a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  P  J
     Carroll (hereafter "the Judge") which was promulgated on  25  November
     2016,  whereby  she  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the
     decision of the Secretary of State to refuse to  recognise  him  as  a
     refugee, or as a person otherwise requiring international protection.

  3. The Appellant is a national of Iran who claims to have entered the  UK
     shortly before he was encountered by the police on 4 August  2015.  He
     claimed asylum on 8 October 2015 on the basis that if he  returned  to
     Iran,  he  would  face  mistreatment  due  to  his   mother's   Afghan
     nationality.

  4. Before the Judge, the Appellant was 14 ï¿½ years old.  The  Judge  heard
     oral evidence from the Appellant and her findings of fact are set  out
     at paragraphs [22] onwards. Essentially, while the Judge accepted  the
     Appellant was of mixed heritage - his mother is of Afghan  origin  and
     his late father is an Iranian national - and observed that  the  claim
     was one of societal discrimination, she was not satisfied  that  "core
     aspects" of his account were credible. The Judge's reasons are set out
     in four sub-paragraphs (a) - (d) at [23]  and  can  be  summarised  as
     follows. The Judge noted inconsistencies in  the  Appellant's  account
     and his failure to adequately explain why he was unable to  remain  in
     contact with his mother  by  means  of  letter.  These  findings  were
     construed as being fatal to the Appellant's  credibility  leading  the
     Judge to dismiss the  protection  claim.  The  Judge  then  turned  to
     address the Appellant's claim contrary to Article 8 of the ECHR. In  a
     succinct paragraph the Judge found there was no  infringement  of  the
     Appellant's human rights given there was  no  question  of  him  being
     returned to Iran before he reached the age of majority [26].

The Application for Permission to Appeal

  5. The Appellant's representatives applied on his behalf  for  permission
     to appeal to the Upper Tribunal and  permission  was  granted  by  the
     First-tier Tribunal on  30  January  2017.  A  Rule  24  response  was
     subsequently settled on behalf of the Secretary of State opposing  the
     Appellant's appeal.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

  6.  At  the  hearing  before  me,   I   heard   submissions   from   both
     representatives. While Mr Kotas initially sought to defend the Judge's
     decision, he accepted following observations made by the Tribunal that
     the Judge's decision cannot stand. I  announced  by  decision  at  the
     hearing that I was satisfied the Judge erred in law and  I  set  aside
     the decision of the First-tier Tribunal. I now  give  my  reasons  for
     doing so.

Error of Law

  7. In an otherwise concise  and  focused  decision  I  am  satisfied  the
     Judge's decision is marred by material errors of law. In view  of  the
     Respondent's concession that the decision could not stand  it  is  not
     necessary to traverse all the grounds raised by Mr Fripp or set out my
     reasons in detail, but I briefly do so below.

  8. I am satisfied that the Judge adopted  an  unclear  and  unsustainable
     approach to her assessment of credibility. The  Judge  draws  negative
     inferences from the evidence she refers to at [23], but  her  analysis
     is unclear and inadequate in a case concerning a minor. In such  cases
     regard, should be given to the Joint Presidential Guidance Note  No  2
     of 2010: Child, Vulnerable  Adult  and  Sensitive  Appellant  Guidance
     which should be  followed  when  considering  the  evidence  of  child
     witnesses. There is no reference to it at  all  in  the  decision.  It
     seems therefore that no consideration was given to the fact that  this
     Appellant as a  child  was  vulnerable  within  the  meaning  of  that
     Guidance Note. In  the  particular  circumstances  of  this  case  the
     failure to address that matter is significant because it has an effect
     on all that follows. In my judgment, this  is  fatal  to  the  Judge's
     assessment of credibility as the appropriate allowance  was  not  made
     and considerations given in respect of  the  Appellant's  evidence.  A
     material error of law has thereby been committed.

  9. Further, the Judge  failed  to  examine  a  material  element  of  the
     Appellant's case namely, whether he was able in  practice  to  achieve
     recognition of his entitlement to Iranian nationality by  the  Iranian
     authorities  in  circumstances  where  his  father  is  deceased;  his
     mother's  Afghan  origin  and  the  fact   that   there   is   serious
     discrimination against Afghans in Iran.

 10. In all the circumstances, the Judge materially erred in  law.  I  thus
     set aside the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I  agree  with
     position adopted by both representatives that the  appropriate  course
     is to remit this matter to the First-tier Tribunal for  rehearing.  In
     view of my finding that the  Judge's  assessment  of  the  Appellant's
     credibility is flawed it is not appropriate to preserve the favourable
     findings at [22] made on behalf of  the  Appellant.  As  there  is  no
     challenge to the Judge's decision in respect of the Article  8  claim,
     the hearing is confined to a de novo hearing on whether the  Appellant
     is entitled to international protection.

Decision

 11. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains  material  errors  of
     law, such that it shall be set aside.

 12. The appeal is remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  de  novo
     hearing of the Appellant's protection claim  before  any  judge  apart
     from Judge P.J Carroll. A Case Management Review hearing  to  consider
     the implications of a  change  in  the  Appellant's  circumstances  as
     notified by Mr Fripp (in that he no longer follows  a  religion),  and
     the future progress of the appeal generally, shall be fixed as soon as
     that can be arranged.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to the Respondent. Failure to comply  with
this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
