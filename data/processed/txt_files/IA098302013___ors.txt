For the respondent: Miss Alice Holmes


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Eileen Herlihy), sitting at Taylor House on 28  October
    2013, to  appeals by a citizen of Pakistan, born 10 February 1979,  his
    dependent wife Abida, born 2 January 1987, and their son A,  also  born
    in Pakistan on 11 January 2007. The appellant has been in this  country
    since 2007, with continuous student leave till  9  March  2013:  before
    that expired, he applied for  tier  1  entrepreneur  leave,  which  was
    refused on 18 March 2013. Abida and A have been here since  July  2011.
    The permission judge expressly declined to grant permission  to  appeal
    on the points raised under the Immigration Rules, but  did  so  on  the
    sole basis that the hearing judge had not considered A's best interests
    in reaching her article 8 assessment.

 2. The appellant's proposed business partner Abdul Rafiq Butt was  refused
    permission to appeal altogether, though that decision appeared  in  the
    same document as the grant to these appellants. Perhaps as a result  of
    that, his case was listed for hearing with theirs; but  I  declined  to
    hear him. Despite the  terms  of  the  grant  of  permission  to  these
    appellants, sent out on 25 November, with notice of  hearing  following
    on 3 December, Mr Randhawa, without the elementary courtesy  of  giving
    notice of his intention, either to the Tribunal or to the Home  Office,
    sought before me to re-open the grounds of appeal under the Immigration
    Rules. Since  permission  had  not  been  expressly  refused  on  those
    grounds, I invited Mr Randhawa to persuade me, if he could,  that  they
    were arguable.

 3. The basis on which the appellant was refused entrepreneur leave was not
    set out as clearly as it might have been, either in the refusal  letter
    or  in  the  first-tier  decision.   Essentially   it   concerned   the
    availability to him (and Mr Butt) as  funding  for  their  business  of
    money held in an account in this country by a Mr Paramjit  Singh.  That
    needed to satisfy the following provisions of appendix A to the Rules:

       41. An applicant will only be considered to have access to funds if:
       (a) The specified documents in paragraph 41-SD are provided to show
       cash money to the amount required (this must not be in the form of
       assets);
       (b) The specified documents in paragraph 41-SD are provided to show
       that the applicant has permission to use the money to invest in a
       business in the UK;
       (c) The money is either held in a UK regulated financial institution
       or is transferable to the UK; and
       (d) The money will remain available to the applicant until such time
       as it is spent in the establishment or running of the applicant's
       business or businesses. ... 'Available to him' means that the funds
       are:
        (1)  in his own possession,
        (2)  in the financial accounts of a UK incorporated business of
           which he is the director, or
        (3)  available from the third party or parties named in the
           application under the terms of the declaration(s) referred to in
           paragraph 41-SD(b) of Appendix A.

 4. Requirements (a) and (c) were satisfied; so the appellant needed  first
    to provide the documents required by (b). Although the money  was  held
    in this country, he could not do so by satisfying the  requirements  of
    paragraph 41-SD (c) (ii), because, contrary to (c) (ii) (4), it was not
    held in his name, or Mr Butt's, but in that of Mr Singh. So  he  needed
    to comply with the requirements of paragraph 41-SD  (i):  the  relevant
    ones are these:

        (i) A letter from each financial institution holding the funds, to
       confirm the amount of money available. Each letter must: ...

       (6) state the applicant's name, and his team partner's name where
       relevant,

 5. Mr Randhawa told me that Mr Singh's bank, in common  with  the  general
    practice of other financial institutions in this country, had  declared
    themselves unable to produce such a letter, confirming the  availablity
    of funds in their own client's account to a third party. This may  well
    be the case, though Mr Randhawa was unable to produce any  letter  from
    the bank to confirm  it.  He  suggested  that  this  state  of  affairs
    defeated the underlying purpose of the Rules, and that  this  raised  a
    question of public importance.

 6. While it is possible that such a question might have to be  decided  in
    some future case, it is conceded, and in any case  beyond  doubt,  that
    this appellant could not satisfy the relevant provisions of the  Rules.
    If that was because banking law meant that they were incapable of being
    satisfied, then this was an argument which needed to be  properly  made
    before the hearing judge, who was faced  with  nothing  more  than  the
    apparent refusal of an  individual  bank  to  provide  the  documentary
    evidence required by the Rules.

 7. The judge was not even arguably wrong in law to hold  that  this  meant
    that the appellant was unable to  satisfy  those  requirements;  as  to
    whether the deficiency was one which could be cured by reference to the
    discretion given by paragraph 245AA (a) of the Rules, which arises

      (b)     If the applicant has submitted specified documents in which:

        (i)  Some of the documents in a sequence  have  been  omitted  (for
           example, if one bank statement from a series is missing);
        (ii) A document is in the wrong format (for example, if a letter is
           not on letterhead paper as specified); or
        (iii) A document is a copy and not an original document; or
        (iv) A document does not contain all of the specified information

    this appellant had been given an opportunity  by  the  Home  Office  to
    produce a bank letter which did comply with the requirements,  but  the
    further letter of 18 February 2013 still did  not  do  so.  I  told  Mr
    Randhawa I was not prepared to hear him further on the Rules.

 8. So far as the  article  8  point  on  which  permission  was  given  is
    concerned, Miss Holmes was prepared to concede that the judge had  been
    wrong not to make  A's  best  interests  a  primary  consideration,  as
    required by ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4. She was inclined to argue that
    this failure had not been material to the decision; however. since  the
    point had not been considered by (or, it seems, put to)  the  judge  at
    all, it seemed to me best to consider it on its merits for myself,  and
    re-make the article 8 decision on  that  basis.  Mr  Randhawa  did  not
    dissent from this course of action.

 9. Mr Randhawa told me that A was now in his third year at school in  this
    country: he submitted that the  appellant,  who  had  obtained  an  MBA
    degree from the University of Wales in the course of his stay here as a
    student, and had a business ready to go  ahead,  would  be  in  a  much
    better position to look after him, and his  mother,  in  this  country,
    than if they all had to return to Pakistan.

10. That was the full extent of my information about  A's  best  interests,
    even though these had formed the ground on which permission  to  appeal
    was given. Clearly at his age (still two  days  short  of  his  seventh
    birthday), he will stay with his mother and  father  whatever  happens.
    While the general trend of immigration suggests  that  their  financial
    prospects as a family  might  be  brighter  in  this  country  than  in
    Pakistan, there is nothing to suggest that this appellant,  clearly  an
    able man with an MBA from a respectable institution  in  this  country,
    would not be able to make his way and look after  his  family  properly
    back home.

11. That being the case, there is nothing but the two years and  a  term  A
    has spent at school in this country to suggest that his best  interests
    might be significantly in favour of  the  whole  family  staying  here.
    However, there is nothing from his school, or elsewhere,  to  show  any
    special needs on his part; and children of that age are generally  well
    capable of adapting to changes in  their  surroundings,  especially  if
    they continue to have, as  he  will,  the  love  and  support  of  both
    parents. No doubt going back to Pakistan after 2ï¿½ years here would be a
    big change for him; but English is an official  and  business  language
    there, as here, and the knowledge of it he will  have  got  could  only
    help him there.

12. I see no reason why A's best interests significantly  militate  against
    his return to Pakistan with his mother and  father.  There  is  nothing
    else in the appellants'  article  8  case  to  suggest  that  this  was
    disproportionate to the legitimate purpose of : none of them  has  ever
    had leave to remain in a capacity leading to settlement, or could  have
    had any legitimate expectation of that, without being  able  to  comply
    with the requirements of the Rules.
