     DECISION PURSUANT TO RULE 40(3)(a) OF THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER
                            TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

 1. The appellant, a citizen of India, appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal
    ("FtT") against a decision to refuse to issue a  residence  card  as  a
    dependant relative of a British citizen, pursuant to  regulation  9  of
    the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006.  The  FtT
    dismissed the appellant's appeal.

 2. Permission to appeal the FtT's decision having been granted, the appeal
    came before me on 19 December 2019.

 3. At the hearing before me it was agreed between the parties that the FtT
    erred in law in dismissing the appeal, for the reasons set out  in  the
    grounds of appeal and in the light of the decision  in  ZA  (Reg  9.EEA
    Regs: abuse of rights) Afghanistan [2019] UKUT 00281 (IAC).

 4. It was further agreed between the parties that in  those  circumstances
    the appropriate outcome is for the decision of the FtT to be set  aside
    for the decision to be re-made in  the  Upper  Tribunal,  allowing  the
    appeal.

 5. I agree that that is the appropriate course and I decide this appeal in
    the terms set out in paragraph 4 above.

 6. Pursuant to rule 40(3)(a) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008, no reasons (or further reasons) are required, the  decision
    being made with the consent of the parties.
