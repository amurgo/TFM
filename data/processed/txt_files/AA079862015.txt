                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's appeal against  the  decision  of  Judge  Pacey
    following a hearing at Birmingham on 28th June 2016.

 2. The background to this matter is as follows.

 3. The appellant is a minor having been born on 21st September  1998.   He
    left Albania on 8th February 2014 and arrived in the UK  on  3rd  March
    2014.  He claimed asylum on 24th April 2014 and  was  refused  on  30th
    April 2015.

 4. The basis of the appellant's case is that he is at risk  on  return  to
    Albania as a consequence of a blood feud.  His paternal uncle had  been
    killed on 5th September 1997, but his father only  discovered  who  the
    perpetrator of the murder was in 2013  some  three  months  before  the
    appellant left Albania.  No one has come forward to take responsibility
    for the death and the evidence before the judge  was  that  until  that
    happened the appellant's father would not forgive the murderer.  It  is
    said that his father says that he would not rest  until  he  had  taken
    revenge.  The appellant is therefore afraid that  if  his  father  does
    take revenge, the murderers  will  retaliate  by  killing  him  as  his
    father's eldest son.

 5. The judge, in a detailed and careful determination, took  into  account
    all of the relevant evidence, setting it out in the determination.  She
    found that the appellant was credible, particularly bearing in mind his
    young age, and she accepted that the murder had taken  place  and  that
    there had been no open-ended commitment to forgiveness  by  the  family
    until the murderer came forward.  There was therefore a possibility  of
    a revenge killing.  She took into account the  relevant  case  law,  in
    particular EH (Albania) CG [2012] UKUT 00348.

 6. At paragraph 38 of the determination she wrote as follows:

         "I also note that the last death (the only death) occurred 19 years
         or so ago.  Whilst  clearly  no  revenge  could  be  taken  by  the
         victim's family until the identity of the perpetrator became known,
         ie in 2013, nonetheless the fact remains that  the  death  occurred
         nearly 20 years ago.  Moreover, no revenge killing has been carried
         out by the Appellant's father in the 2ï¿½ years or so  since  he  did
         find out the perpetrator's identity.  The Appellant states that his
         father finds it difficult to do so.  If he found it hard to  do  so
         when he first learnt who the perpetrator was  and  when  reasonably
         then emotions were at their heights,  and  despite  the  apparently
         very strong pressure of Kanun law and honour, such that he took  to
         excessive drinking, then in my view it  is  reasonable  to  suppose
         that with the passage of time his  impetus  to  take  revenge  will
         weaken.  The dead man was the Appellant's uncle; there  are  closer
         family members who would reasonably be more at risk if  his  father
         took revenge; in particular his father himself and the  dead  man's
         adult son."

    She concluded that the appellant would only be at risk  if  his  father
    carried out the revenge killing and  he  was  currently  not  at  risk.
    Moreover internal relocation would be a possibility if he relocated  to
    a part of the country where Kanun law is not  so  prevalent.   On  that
    basis she dismissed the appeal.

 7. The appellant sought permission to appeal on a number  of  grounds.  It
    was noted that the appellant was found to be credible, that  the  judge
    had found that this was a modern blood feud, and it was argued that  it
    remained active until  a  reconciliation  was  brokered.   The  grounds
    criticise the judge's finding that  there  was  no  evidence  that  the
    killing was notorious, since the transcript of the DVD noted that 2,000
    men  attended  the  funeral.   Furthermore  the  judge  had  erred   by
    speculating that the appellant's father's impetus to take revenge would
    decrease over time and that  she  was  wrong  to  find  that  he  could
    relocate because he would be subject to self-confinement and  therefore
    it would be unduly harsh.

 8.  Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  Immigration  Judge  Ransley.
    Immigration Judge Ransley simply set out a summary of the  grounds  and
    said that the judge's decision involved arguable errors of law but  she
    did not say in what respect she considered that this was the case.

 9.  A  reply  was  served  by  the  Secretary  of  State   defending   the
    determination. The grounds had no merit.  It was obvious from the facts
    that there was currently no blood feud;  the claim was hypothetical and
    speculative.

10. Ms Manning, by way of submissions, relied on  her  grounds  and  argued
    that the judge had erred in finding that there  was  no  current  blood
    feud.  In particular she  drew  my  attention  to  a  letter  from  the
    appellant's mother which says that the father is  becoming  aggressive,
    nervous, drinking a lot of alcohol and thinking about nothing  but  how
    to kill and take revenge.  She pointed out that the appellant had  been
    found to be credible and the logical conclusion would be that he was at
    risk.

11. Mr Wilding relied on his Rule 24 response and said  there  was  nothing
    wrong with this determination.  It was simply an opportunity to attempt
    to re-argue the case which he said was extremely weak.  The  judge  had
    reached the only decision properly open to her.

12. I have to say that I am surprised  that  this  case  was  ever  granted
    permission  to  appeal.   This  is  a  well-thought-out  well  reasoned
    determination.

13. The judge conducted a painstaking review of all  of  the  evidence  and
    reached the only possible conclusion open to her on that evidence.   It
    is quite plain that the appellant cannot establish a  present  risk  on
    return.  The only death in the family occurred nineteen years  ago  and
    there has been no revenge attack by his  family  on  the  perpetrator's
    family to date.  The judge was perfectly entitled to observe  that  the
    appellant's family have known the identity  of  the  murderer's  family
    since 2013 and no action has been taken against them.  The  observation
    that the impetus to take revenge will weaken over time is self-evident.



14. The grounds are a simple disagreement with the decision and an  attempt
    to re-argue the case.  The determination will stand.   Accordingly  the
    appellant's appeal is dismissed.

Notice of Decision

15. The appeal is dismissed.
