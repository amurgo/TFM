Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J. Plowright of Counsel, instructed by Perera and
Company
For the Respondent:    Mr P Naith, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The appellant is a national of Nigeria, born on 27 February 1946.  He
       arrived in this country in 2007 on a 6-month visa, granted to  enable
       him to access private medical treatment.

    2. On 31 October 2014 the respondent  refused  the  appellant's  renewed
       application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom on human rights
       grounds. For the purposes of this appeal, the relevant determinations
       were:

        a. that the appellant did not meet the Suitability requirements for
           limited leave to remain on the grounds of family or private life
           under Paragraph 276ADE of Appendix FM to the Immigration  Rules.
           The respondent found that S-LTR.2.3 was  not  satisfied  because
           the appellant owes the NHS in excess of �1000; and

        b. that in any event, the appellant  could  not  satisfy  Paragraph
           276ADE(vi) because there were no very significant  obstacles  to
           the appellant integrating into Nigeria; and

        c. that the appellant's  medical  condition,  including  End  Stage
           Renal failure (meaning  that  the  appellant  requires  dialysis
           three times a week at least until a transplant is available) did
           not entail that his removal would be contrary to articles 3 or 8
           of the  ECHR.  The  appellant  would  have  access  to  adequate
           treatment in Nigeria (and  a  potential  donor  had  been  found
           there) and, in any event, the appellant's condition was  not  so
           serious as to cross the very high threshold  set  in  D  v.  The
           United Kingdom  (1997) 24 EHRR 423 (and recently considered  and
           applied in GS (India) and others [2015] EWCA Civ 40).

    3. The appellant's appeal was dismissed by  Judge  Nicholls  on  28  May
       2015.  The judge has no difficulty in rejecting the  appeal   against
       the  article  3  decision,  applying  the  decision  in  GS  (India),
       recording that the appellant  recognised  the  difficulties  in  that
       aspect of his appeal.

    4. In relation to the appeal against the determination in respect of the
       appellant's private life  claim,  the  judge  expressed  reservations
       about the finding  on  Suitability  (but  made  no  finding  in  that
       regard). However, the judge in any event saw no basis  on  which  the
       appellant could satisfy paragraph 276ADE(vi) because the only grounds
       for the appellant's contention that he would  face  very  significant
       obstacles in integrating into Nigeria were  related  to  his  medical
       condition.  Judge Nicholl held that, as the  Immigration  Rules  were
       designed to give effect to article 8 rights, those rules could not be
       satisfied where it was  established  that  there  was  no  breach  of
       article 8, such as in medical cases  which  did  not  meet  the  high
       threshold referred to in GS (India).

    5. On 17 August 2015 Judge Nicholson granted the appellant permission to
       appeal  on  the  grounds  that  Judge  Nicholls'  approach   to   the
       interrelationship between  paragraph  276ADE(vi)  and  article  8  in
       medical cases was novel and gave rise to an arguable point of law.

    6. The respondent, by letter dated 27 August 2015, took the  point  that
       the appellant cannot in any event succeed on  his  claim  because  he
       owes the  NHS  at  least  �200,000  and  cannot  therefore  meet  the
       suitability requirements for a private life.

    7. We invited Mr Plowright, counsel for the  appellant,  to  deal  first
       with the question of Suitability.  He referred us  to  the  following
       relevant provisions in Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules:

           "S-LTR.2.1. The applicant will normally be refused on grounds of
           suitability if any of paragraphs S-LTR.2.2. to 2.4. apply.

           ...

           S-LTR.2.3. One or  more  relevant  NHS  body  has  notified  the
           Secretary of State that the applicant has failed to pay  charges
           in accordance with the relevant NHS regulations  on  charges  to
           overseas visitors and the outstanding charges have a total value
           of at least �1000".

    8. Mr Plowright accepted that Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital had notified
       the respondent that his client had been invoiced for  charges  to  an
       overseas visitor totalling in excess of  �200,000  and  that  he  had
       failed to pay  any  of  those  charges.  He  further  accepted  that,
       although the NHS has stated  that  it  had  assessed  those  sums  as
       "irrecoverable", that did not mean that the invoices had ceased to be
       outstanding: the fact that a creditor does not see  any  prospect  of
       recovering a debt (and even writes it off  internally)  does  not  in
       itself remit the debt.

    9. Mr Plowright's relied instead on  the  discretionary  nature  of  the
       decision as to Suitability arising from non-payment of  NHS  charges,
       such a discretion being inherent  in  the  provision  that  leave  to
       remain will "normally" be refused in such circumstances. He  referred
       to the fact that that the respondent did not expressly carry out  any
       balancing exercise in considering the application  of  S-LTR.2.1,  an
       aspect on which Judge Nicholl also remarked in his decision.

   10. The respondent did, however, set out the history of  the  appellant's
       medical charges in some detail, as follows:

        a. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom in  2007,  expressly
           on the basis that he wished to access private medical treatment,
           stating that he had an appointment with a private clinic.

        b. In the event the appellant did not attend  such  a  clinic,  but
           instead obtained extensive treatment on the NHS.

        c. In October 2007 the appellant applied for an  extension  to  his
           visa, stating that he would leave after his  private  treatment.
           This application was supported by a letter from his sister dated
           21 October 2007, stating that she would  support  the  appellant
           throughout his stay for  medical  treatment.  In  contrast,  the
           month  before  his  sister  had  written  to  the  NHS   Finance
           Department  stating  that  she  was  unable  to  pay   for   the
           appellant's mounting NHS bills.

        d. In May 2008 the appellant submitted a letter in support  of  his
           application for an extension of stay, claiming that Guy's and St
           Thomas' Hospital had waived fees for treatment,  but  would  not
           confirm that in writing. But on 28 August 2008  that  NHS  Trust
           confirmed that the appellant had no right to free NHS care,  had
           been billed by the Overseas Visitors Office,  but  had  made  no
           payment. Those matters were re-confirmed in a  letter  dated  25
           September 2008.

        e. The appellant was refused leave  to  remain  in  2008,  and  his
           appeal was  dismissed  in  2009.  Judge  Mitchell  recorded  the
           appellant's sister's evidence that the NHS had  billed  �180,000
           for the appellant's treatment, but had agreed not to enforce the
           invoices it  was  sending.  However,  other  invoices  had  been
           submitted subsequent to that alleged agreement.

   11. It follows that the appellant has incurred  outstanding  NHS  charges
       many times the amount where leave to remain will normally be refused,
       and has done so whilst remaining in the United Kingdom illegally  and
       by exercising a  significant  degree  of  deception  in  relation  to
       payment for his medical treatment. It  is  therefore  not  surprising
       that the respondent took the 'normal' course  of  refusing  leave  to
       remain by reason of the outstanding charges.

   12. Indeed, it is not clear what countervailing factors should have  been
       considered on the question of Suitability: none was identified by the
       appellant in his application and none was suggested by Mr  Plowright.
       We accept Mr Plowright's submission that  the  respondent  must  take
       into account all relevant circumstances in exercising  a  discretion,
       but we cannot see that the respondent can be criticised for following
       a   course of action presumed by the Rules in a plain case, where  no
       countervailing factors are apparent or suggested.

   13. In view of our conclusion on the issue of Suitability,  the  question
       of law in respect of which permission to appeal was granted does  not
       arise for decision.
