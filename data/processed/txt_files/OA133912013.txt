For the Appellant:           Mr Tarlow,  Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Ilahi, Counsel


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Respondent is a national of Pakistan date of birth 6th August 1983.
    On the 14th April 2014 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Ghaffar)  allowed
    her appeal against refusal to grant her entry clearance as  the  spouse
    of a person present and settled in the UK. The Entry Clearance  Officer
    (ECO) now has permission to appeal against that decision.





 2. The matter in issue was whether the Respondent had met the requirements
    of EC-P.3.1 of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules. The Sponsor, a  Mr
    Nauman Hussain, claimed to earn �17,000 per  annum  in  his  employment
    with 'Weathershield' and a further �2000  per  annum  from  working  at
    'Crispy (UK) Ltd'.   In support of that claim he had submitted payslips
    and a letter from  Weathershield,  and  produced  his  bank  statements
    showing his Weathershield salary  to  be  paid  into  his  account.  In
    respect of Crispy he could produce payslips, a P60 and  a  letter  from
    his employer, but was unable to show the salary  being  paid  into  his
    account since he was  paid  in  cash.   The  Crispy  salary  could  not
    therefore be taken into account because paragraph A1.2 of Appendix  FM-
    SE requires income from employment to be evidenced by (a)  wage  slips,
    (b) a letter from the employer and (c) personal bank statements showing
    the salary being paid in: the latter he did not have.

 3. On appeal to the First-tier Tribunal Judge Ghaffar found as  fact  that
    the Sponsor did in fact earn �2000 per annum from Crispy,  which  taken
    with his Weathershield employment, took him over the required threshold
    of �18,600 per annum. He accepted that his salary at Crispy was paid to
    the  Sponsor  in  cash  and  did  not  therefore  appear  in  his  bank
    statements. Having made that finding he allowed the appeal outright.

 4. The ECO obtained permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  the
    ground that it was not open to the Judge to allow the appeal under  the
    Immigration Rules since the Respondent had plainly not met all  of  the
    requirements of the Rules, as outlined above. At a hearing on the  30th
    June 2014 Upper Tribunal Judge Dawson agreed  with  the  ECO  that  the
    determination contained this error of law and set the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal aside.

 5. The matter has  now  come  before  me  to  be  re-made.  I  have  heard
    submissions from Mr Tarlow and Mr Ilahi for which I am grateful.

 6. The point is a narrow one.  As Mr Tarlow agreed  the  determination  of
    the First-tier Tribunal contains undisturbed findings of fact that  the
    income of this family will be in excess of  �18,600.  The  Sponsor  has
    demonstrated that he was earning �17000  plus  �2000  at  the  date  of
    decision; his  difficulty  is  that  he  has  not  demonstrated  it  in
    accordance with Appendix FM-SE A1.2 (c).

 7. Paragraph A (e) of Appendix FM-SE reads as follows:
         (e) Where the decision-maker is satisfied that there is a valid
         reason why a specified document(s) cannot be supplied, e.g. because
         it is not issued in a particular country or has been permanently
         lost, he or she may exercise discretion not to apply the
         requirement for the document(s) or to request alternative or
         additional information or document(s) be submitted by the
         applicant.
 8. The decision of the ECO dated the 9th January 2013 is  entirely  silent
    on whether this, or any other 'evidential flexibility' policy has  been
    considered in the context of this  appeal.  The  P60,  wage  slips  and
    employer's letter in respect of  Crispy  all  appear  in  the  evidence
    before the ECO. It would seem that no consideration has been  given  to
    whether:


           a) the Sponsor  was  unable  to  produce  said  bank  statements
              because his employer chose to pay him in cash;


           b) whether that is a "valid reason" for not complying  with  the
              requirements of FM-SE A1.2  (c)  (noting  that  the  examples
              given in the rule itself, such a  document  being  lost,  are
              part of a non-exhaustive list and  serve  as  exempli  gratia
              rather than id est); and

           c)  whether  he  has  demonstrated  his  earnings  by  means  of
              alternative documents ie the P60 etc.


 9. I therefore allow the appeal on the basis that the decision was not  in
    accordance with  the  law  because  the  ECO  failed  to  consider  the
    discretion built into the  Rules.  No  doubt  when  the  ECO  comes  to
    exercise his or her discretion  consideration  will  be  given  to  the
    findings of fact of the First-tier  Tribunal  that  the  family  income
    does, as a matter of fact, exceed the required amount.




      Decisions

10. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error  of  law
    and it has been set aside.


11. I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it:  the  decision  of
    the Entry Clearance Officer was not in accordance with the law.
