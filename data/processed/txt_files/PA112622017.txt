                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr G P McGowan, of Quinn Martin & Langan Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This decision is to be read with:

      i) The respondent's decision  dated  20  October  2017,  refusing  the
         appellant's claim.

     ii) The appellant's grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

    iii) The decision of FtT Judge Sorrell, promulgated on 18 January 2018.

     iv) The appellant's grounds of appeal to the UT (1 - 7) stated  in  the
         application for permission to appeal filed on 31 January 2018.

      v) The grant  of  permission  by  FtT  Judge  Hollingworth,  dated  24
         February 2018.

     vi) The respondent's rule 24 response, dated  20  March  2018,  to  the
         grant of permission.

    vii) The letter from the appellant's solicitors dated 26 September 2018,
         seeking to argue a further ground (8) based  on  TF  &  MA  v  SSHD
         [2018] CSIH 58.

 2. Mr Govan did not oppose amendment of the grounds.

 3. The record of  proceedings  provided  by  the  appellant  supports  the
    proposition that the  judge  erred  as  contended  in  ground  (7),  by
    misunderstanding the evidence of Mr Taylor, which had not been that  he
    doubted the sincerity of the appellant, but that at one  stage  it  had
    been thought desirable for him to undertake further religious learning,
    following  which  he  was  considered  ready  for  baptism.   Mr  Govan
    confirmed that  the  note  kept  by  his  colleague  was  similar.   He
    acknowledged that there were two other errors of fact, and  that  these
    all fed into grounds (7) and (8).

 4. The following outcome was agreed.

 5. The decision of the FtT is set aside.

 6. The nature of the case is such that it is appropriate under section  12
    of the 2002 Act and Practice Statement 7.2 to remit to the FtT  for  an
    entirely fresh hearing.

 7. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Sorrell.

 8. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.

 9. This decision, as originally issued, said at paragraph 5 that the FtT's
    decision stood as a record of what  had  been  said.   The  appellant's
    solicitors point out in a letter dated  8  October  2018  that  it  was
    agreed the record  was  not  (entirely)  accurate.   This  decision  is
    accordingly re-issued under rule 42, without the relevant sentence,  to
    avoid any ambiguity and future doubt.
