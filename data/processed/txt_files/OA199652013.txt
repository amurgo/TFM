                       ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER - dhaka

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr G Hodgetts, instructed by South West Law
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who was born on 8  July  1987.
    He applied for entry clearance to join his wife (the  sponsor)  in  the
    UK.  That application was refused by the Entry Clearance Officer on  27
    October 2013 and the appellant appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    Before that hearing took place, the ECO made  a  fresh  decision  on  7
    September 2014 in the light of the Court of Appeal's decision in R  (MM
    (Lebanon)) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985.  The ECO maintained the  earlier
    refusal of entry clearance.

 2. The appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Mathews)  on  18
    November  2014.   Judge  Mathews  allowed  the   appeal   against   the
    application of the general refusal ground in para 320(11) of the  Rules
    but dismissed the appeal on its merits both under the Rules and Art  8.
    In relation to the Immigration Rules,  Judge  Mathews  found  that  the
    appellant could not meet the "partner" provisions in EC-P  of  Appendix
    FM in two respects.  First,  the  judge  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    appellant met the English language requirement.  Secondly  he  was  not
    satisfied in respect of the financial requirements, namely  based  upon
    her income in the six months prior to the application, that the sponsor
    had a pro rata income of ï¿½18,600 per annum.

 3. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  On 26
    January 2015,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (DJ  Macdonald)  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on the basis  that
    the judge was arguably wrong not to take  account  of  the  appellant's
    English language certificate which was in  existence  at  the  date  of
    decision and secondly the Judge had failed to take into account all the
    documentary evidence in relation to the appellant's claimed income.

 4. On 3 February 2015, the respondent served a rule 24 notice in which  he
    stated  that  he  did  not  "oppose  the  appellant's  application  for
    permission to appeal" and invited the Tribunal to determine the  appeal
    at a fresh oral hearing.

 5. Thus, the appeal came before me.  The error of law being conceded,  the
    decision fell to be re-made.

 6. Mr Mills, who represented the respondent, conceded that  the  appellant
    had established the requirements in Appendix FM.  He accepted that  the
    evidence, in accordance with  Appendix  FM-SE,  demonstrated  that  the
    sponsor  earned  sufficient  income  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM.  Further, Mr Mills accepted that the  appellant's  English
    language certificate was in existence at the date of  decision,  albeit
    that it was only produced at the appeal hearing.  He accepted that  the
    appellant met the English language requirement on  the  basis  of  that
    certificate.

 7. Mr Mills acknowledged that the  judge  had  found  in  the  appellant's
    favour on para 320(11) of the  Rules  and  that  had  not  been  cross-
    appealed by the respondent.  In those circumstances, he invited  me  to
    allow the appellant's appeal.

 8. In addition, Mr Mills did  not  suggest  that  the  appellant  did  not
    currently meet the  financial  requirements  of  the  Rules  and  that,
    therefore, he accepted that there was no  reason  why  entry  clearance
    should not be granted to him as a spouse to join his wife in the UK.

Decision

 9. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal under the Immigration Rules and Art 8 involved the making of  an
    error of law and is set aside.

10. I remake  the  decision  allowing  the  appellant's  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules, namely Section EC-P of Appendix FM.   The  appellant
    is entitled to the grant of entry clearance as a spouse.


                                                                      Signed



                                                                     A Grubb
                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal


TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I do not make a fee award as the appellant's appeal has  only  been  allowed
on the basis of  evidence  produced  at  the  appeal  hearing  (the  English
language certificate) and which was not  provided  to  the  Entry  Clearance
Officer when making his decision.



                                                                      Signed


                                                                     A Grubb
                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal
