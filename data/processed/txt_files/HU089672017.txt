Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
No anonymity direction was made by the First-tier Tribunal  Judge.  However,
as the appeal involves minor children, it is appropriate  to  anonymise  the
identity of the Appellant. Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs
otherwise,  the  Appellant  is  granted  anonymity.  No  report   of   these
proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member  of  his
family. This direction applies both to the Appellant and to the  Respondent.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      BACKGROUND

    1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State.  However,  we  continue
       to refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.
        The Respondent appeals against a decision  of  First-Tier  Tribunal
       Judge N Haria promulgated on 17 June 2019 ("the Decision")  (not  17
       June 2017 as stated on  the  face  of  the  Decision)  allowing  the
       Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision dated 9  August
       2017 refusing his human rights claim.  The Respondent's decision was
       made in the context of a decision refusing to  revoke  an  order  to
       deport the Appellant based on his criminal offending.


    2. The Appellant asserts that removal will breach his Article 8  rights
       based on his relationship with his partner, [VO] and her child  (the
       Appellant's stepson) [BHO]  and  also  the  relationship  which  the
       Appellant has recently re-kindled with his  biological  child  [VO2]
       who lives with her mother in the UK.  [VO2]  has  limited  leave  to
       remain in the UK.  [VO] and [BHO] are British citizens.

    3. The Judge recognised that [VO2] was not a "qualifying child"  within
       the definition in the Immigration Rules ("the  Rules")  and  Section
       117C Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  ("Section  117C")
       ([16(viii)] of the  Decision).   She  also  found  at  [74]  of  the
       Decision that the impact of deportation would not  be  unduly  harsh
       for [VO].  However, for reasons set out  at  [76]  to  [86]  of  the
       Decision, the Judge found that it would be unduly harsh for [BHO] to
       relocate to Nigeria with the Appellant or to remain with [VO] in the
       UK without the Appellant.

    4. The Respondent appealed the Decision on one  ground  which  contends
       that the Judge made a material misdirection  or  failed  to  provide
       adequate reasons for the finding  that  deportation  would  have  an
       unduly harsh impact on [BHO].

    5. On 12 July 2019, First-tier Tribunal Judge Fisher refused permission
       to appeal in the following terms so far as relevant:

            "... 3.    In her decision,  the  Judge  reminded  herself,  at
           paragraph 75, of the degree of  harshness  required.   She  gave
           careful consideration to all of the  evidence  relating  to  the
           children, especially the Appellant's stepson, who  suffers  from
           various educational, social and mental health  issues,  and  was
           entitled to conclude that it would be unduly harsh for the child
           to relocate to Nigeria,  or  to  lose  his  close  and  personal
           relationship with the Appellant.
            4.   The Judge's  findings  were  open  to  her,  and  she  was
           entitled to conclude that the consequences of deportation  would
           be unduly harsh.  She was at pains to adhere to the  appropriate
           test.  I am not satisfied that the grounds disclose any arguable
           error of law.  Accordingly, permission to appeal is refused."

    6. On renewed application to this Tribunal, permission was  granted  by
       Upper Tribunal Judge Pickup in the following terms, again so far  as
       relevant:


            "... 3.    It is  arguable  that,  whilst  at  [75]  the  judge
           correctly stated that one is looking for a degree  of  harshness
           going beyond that which would necessarily be  involved  for  any
           child faced with  the  deportation  of  a  parent,  the  various
           consequences relied on from [84] onwards do not go beyond  harsh
           to the point of being unduly harsh.  At  [86]  the  judge  found
           that the appellant's  removal  would  have  a  material  adverse
           effect on the child and mean he is no longer going to be able to
           maintain contact with  the  appellant  in  accordance  with  the
           family court order.  That cannot arguably amount to being unduly
           harsh.
            4.   In the circumstances, an arguable material error of law is
           disclosed by the grounds."


    7. The matter came before  us  to  decide  whether  the  Decision  does
       contain any error of law.  At the end of the hearing,  we  indicated
       that we were satisfied that no material error of law  was  disclosed
       by the Respondent's grounds and that we would provide our reasons in
       writing for so finding which we now turn to do.


    RESPONDENT'S GROUNDS


    8. The Respondent's grounds are  pleaded  in  short  order.   In  short
       summary, it is said that:
           (a)    the Judge has "failed to give clear reasons as to how the
           high threshold of unduly harsh consequences" is met;
           (b)   the reports from the professionals as to impact  on  [BHO]
           cited at [84] of the Decision "do not show that the  appellant's
           absence will lead to a complete collapse  in  the  physical,  or
           psychological welfare of the child" and  that  the  difficulties
           shown to exist by those reports "are  significantly  lower  than
           the threshold of unduly harsh consequences";
           (c)   the Judge did not suggest that the "physical and emotional
           needs of the child" could not continue to be met by [VO] and has
           given no consideration to the support offered by other agencies.


    9. The Respondent was directed to file a skeleton argument and did  so.
       The focus of the arguments there put is that  the  Judge  failed  to
       have regard to the high threshold for a finding that the  impact  of
       deportation is unduly harsh.  Reliance was placed  on  Secretary  of
       State for the Home Department v PG (Jamaica) [2019]  EWCA  Civ  1213
       ("PG (Jamaica)"), in particular  [38]  and  [39]  of  the  judgment.
       Those paragraphs point to the need for the degree of harshness to go
       "beyond what would necessarily be involved for any partner or  child
       of a foreign criminal facing deportation".  The Court also made  the
       point that "great distress" for a child is the expected  consequence
       of the deportation of one of the child's parents and that  something
       more is needed to reach a finding that the impact is  unduly  harsh.
       Reliance was also placed on the support which [VO] would continue to
       provide and the additional assistance which [BHO] could obtain  from
       agencies in the UK.  It is also asserted that the Judge provided  no
       evidential underpinning for  the  finding  at  [84(iv)]  that  [BHO]
       "would be unlikely to receive appropriate assistance and support  in
       Nigeria".  Finally, the Respondent points to [85] and  [86]  of  the
       Decision where it is said that the Judge has incorporated  her  best
       interests' assessment into the unduly harsh  consideration.   It  is
       asserted that best interests of a child cannot dictate  the  outcome
       in a deportation context.

      SUBMISSIONS AND DISCUSSION


   10. As Mr Moriarty pointed out in his submissions, some of Mr  Lindsay's
       submissions strayed beyond the pleaded grounds.  However, given  the
       wide-  ranging  nature  of  the  pleading  and  since   those   oral
       submissions  focussed,  in  essence,  on  whether  the   Judge   had
       recognised and applied the correct  test,  we  did  not  prevent  Mr
       Lindsay from developing the grounds in that way.

   11. We note at the outset that Mr Lindsay accepted that on the facts  of
       this case a Judge could conclude that the impact of  deportation  of
       the Appellant on [BHO] would be unduly harsh.  He  did  not  advance
       the case as one of perversity although he did indicate  that,  since
       part of the Respondent's case is that the conclusions are not  borne
       out by the reasons, that may be tantamount to an assertion that  the
       Decision is perverse.

   12. Mr Lindsay's first point concerns the Judge's application  of  case-
       law and, in particular, whether she recognised  the  high  threshold
       which applies to the "unduly harsh"  test.   Consideration  of  this
       test begins at [70] of the Decision with  a  heading  "Section  117C
       (5): Unduly harsh - the partner". The Judge  there  correctly  self-
       directs that the threshold is to be applied  without  any  balancing
       exercise (per KO (Nigeria) and others v Secretary of State  for  the
       Home Department [2018] UKSC 53 - "KO (Nigeria)").  Reference is then
       made to what is said about the elevated nature of the  threshold  in
       MK (Section 55 - Tribunal Options) Sierra Leone [2015] UKUT 223 ("MK
       (Sierra Leone)").  The Judge  thereafter  considers  the  impact  of
       deportation on the Appellant's partner [VO] and  concludes  at  [74]
       that the impact is not unduly harsh.  There then follows  a  further
       heading "Section 117C (5): Unduly harsh - the children".   At  [75],
       the Judge reminds herself of what is said in KO (Nigeria) that  "one
       is looking for a degree  of  harshness  going  beyond  [what]  would
       necessarily be involved for any child faced with the deportation  of
       a parent".  The Judge thereafter reviews the evidence in relation to
       the impact on [BHO] predominantly (although with mention  of  [VO2])
       before reaching the conclusion at [87]  that  the  impact  on  [BHO]
       would be unduly harsh.


   13. Based on  the  drafting  of  those  sections  of  the  Decision,  Mr
       Lindsay's first  point  was  that  the  Judge  considered  that  the
       elevated threshold applied only to the Appellant's partner  and  not
       the children. As he  pointed  out,  it  is  customary  for  Tribunal
       decisions to set out the law in one section and thereafter apply the
       law in what follows.  In this case, the Judge had  already  set  out
       the relevant law in detail in the section at [31]  to  [38]  of  the
       Decision.  Mr Lindsay submitted that the fact the Judge had  reached
       a conclusion based on the elevated threshold  in  relation  to  [VO]
       before moving on to a different section dealing  with  the  children
       which included no reference to that  threshold  indicated  that  the
       Judge had not (or may not have) applied that elevated  threshold  in
       what followed.  He pointed to the Judge's conclusions at  [88]  that
       both [VO] and [BHO] would be "severely negatively impacted"  by  the
       Appellant's deportation and yet had previously found the  impact  on
       [VO] not to be unduly harsh whereas the impact on  [BHO]  would  be.
       He also suggested that it was implicit in the Judge's  consideration
       of the evidence in  relation  to  [BHO]  that  she  was  considering
       whether the impact of deportation went  beyond  what  would  be  the
       normal consequences of deportation based on  the  citation  from  KO
       (Nigeria) but without any consideration of the high threshold  which
       applies.


   14. As Mr Moriarty pointed out, the reference to MK  (Sierra  Leone)  at
       [72] of the Decision follows on from the reference to  KO  (Nigeria)
       at [71] and is made in the context of the latter judgment.  As such,
       the  Judge  was  simply  applying  the  guidance  in  KO  (Nigeria).
       Moreover, MK (Sierra Leone) is a decision dealing with the impact on
       children.  As such, Mr Moriarty submitted that the citation at  [75]
       was simply an additional reference and  that  the  Judge  throughout
       both those sections was applying the elevated threshold.

   15. We remind ourselves that we are not here construing a  statute.   Of
       course, we must analyse the Decision to ascertain the test which the
       Judge has applied and whether she has applied the  correct  test  to
       the evidence.  The two sections to which we have made reference,  at
       [70] to [74] (concerning [VO])  and  at  [75]  to  [87]  (concerning
       [BHO]), are part of one longer section  beginning  at  [56]  of  the
       Decision and dealing as a whole  with  Article  8  ECHR.   As  such,
       simply because the Judge chooses to include a  relevant  proposition
       of law in one part of that section and does not thereafter repeat it
       does not mean that she can be taken to have forgotten about it.   As
       Mr Moriarty pointed out, there is no requirement for Judges to  keep
       repeating the legal test which applies.

   16. Moreover, we can find no indication  that,  in  her  review  of  the
       evidence relating to [BHO], the Judge had lost sight of the elevated
       threshold which applies.  As is pointed out at [77] of the Decision,
       and as the Respondent  accepts,  [BHO]  "suffers  from  a  range  of
       social, emotional, mental health and  learning  needs,  particularly
       following the Appellant's period of imprisonment and  the  death  of
       his biological father in May 2016".   The Judge points  at  [82]  of
       the  Decision  to  the  "copious   documentary   evidence   of   the
       relationship between the  Appellant  and  BHO  showing  the  adverse
       effect  on  him  of  separation  from  the  Appellant  due  to   his
       imprisonment". The Judge places particular emphasis on three  pieces
       of  evidence  from  Dr  Meheux  (who  is  a  Child  and   Adolescent
       Educational Psychologist), [BHO] himself and  from  [BHO]'s  school.
       The extracts from those pieces of evidence are  all  concerned  with
       the nature and extent of the adverse impacts on [BHO] caused by  the
       Appellant's absence during his detention.

   17. Mr Lindsay suggested that what is said at [84] of  the  Decision  is
       indicative of the Judge having only considered  whether  the  impact
       goes beyond what would necessarily  be  involved  in  a  deportation
       case.  No doubt referring back to what precedes that  paragraph  the
       Judge says that "[i]t is clear given the adverse impact  on  BHO  of
       his separation from the Appellant  whilst  he  was  imprisoned,  the
       impact of the Appellant's deportation on BHO is likely to go  beyond
       what would necessarily be involved for most children faced with  the
       deportation of a parent, due to BHO's personal  characteristics  and
       underlying  developmental  needs".   Rather   than   assisting   the
       Respondent's case, we consider that  this  sentence  undermines  it.
       The Judge is there making clear that what she  had  previously  been
       considering was the extent of the impact on [BHO] before looking  at
       this again in the context of  whether  it  went  beyond  the  normal
       consequences of deportation.

   18. For those reasons, we cannot accept that the Judge did not  have  in
       mind the correct  threshold  when  considering  the  impact  of  the
       Appellant's deportation on [BHO].

   19. Mr Lindsay also made the point  that  the  Judge  had  impermissibly
       included [VO2] when looking at the harshness of impact.  As we  have
       already noted, [VO2] is not a "qualifying child" for the purposes of
       the Rules or Section 117C.  Mr Lindsay directed our attention to the
       heading dealing with Section 117C (5) between [74] and [75] to which
       we have already referred.  He made the point  that  this  refers  to
       "children" rather than "child".  There is however  nothing  to  this
       point.  First, the entire section from [75] to [87] of the  Decision
       mentions [VO2] only once and that is at [86] where the Judge  points
       out that the Appellant's removal would mean that the Appellant would
       not be able to maintain contact with [VO2] in  accordance  with  the
       Family Court Order. That does not however amount to a  finding  that
       the impact on  [VO2]  would  be  unduly  harsh.   Second,  and  more
       importantly,  what  the  Judge  was  rightly  considering  was   the
       harshness of the impact on [BHO] alone.  Once  she  had  found  that
       this would be unduly harsh, the Appellant was entitled  to  succeed,
       irrespective of any reference to [VO2].


   20. It was also suggested that the Judge had wrongly  assumed  that  the
       best interests of the children dictate the outcome in a  deportation
       case.  That is based on what is said at [64] (wrongly numbered)  and
       [85] of the Decision. However, the Judge had already  conducted  her
       best interests' assessment (as she was bound to do) earlier  in  the
       Decision (at [52] to [55]).  As Mr Moriarty pointed  out,  what  the
       Judge was considering at [85] was the  Respondent's  assertion  that
       contact between [BHO] and the Appellant could be maintained  through
       visits and "modern means of communication".  That  was  relevant  to
       the harshness of impact on [BHO] based on the loss of  the  physical
       presence  of  the  Appellant.    It   was   therefore   a   relevant
       consideration.

   21. A further point made by Mr Lindsay  concerns  what  he  said  was  a
       muddling by the Judge of the harshness of [BHO] remaining in the  UK
       without the Appellant and returning to Nigeria with  him  and  [VO].
       He drew our attention to the list  of  the  factors  at  [84(i)]  to
       [84(vi)] of the Decision.  Initially, he submitted that (i) to (iii)
       were not relevant at all.  However, as was pointed out,  the  impact
       of deportation on a child who has the right to remain in the UK  has
       to be considered in the alternative  scenarios  that  a  child  will
       remain in the UK without the parent to be deported  or  will  return
       with that parent to the parent's country of origin (unless there  is
       a concession by the Respondent that the child cannot be expected  to
       leave which there was not in this case). He then said that the Judge
       should have considered the two alternatives separately as it was not
       clear which factor refers to which of the alternatives.

   22. We reject that submission.  First, it is in  our  view,  very  clear
       from the list at [84] of the  Decision  which  of  the  factors  are
       relevant to the possibility of the child leaving the UK.  Those  are
       at (i) to (iii).  Similarly, the evidence referred to  at  [80]  and
       [81] of the Decision is clearly relevant only to the possibility  of
       [BHO] leaving the UK.  We observe in passing, to deal  with  one  of
       the Respondent's points in her skeleton argument, that the  evidence
       referred to at [80] of  the  Decision  is  the  foundation  for  the
       finding at [84(iv)] that [BHO] "would be highly unlikely to  receive
       appropriate assistance and support in Nigeria". Second, what a Judge
       is directed to do by Section  117C  (5)  is  consider  whether  "the
       effect" on the child would be unduly harsh  which  encompasses  both
       alternatives.  It is the overall effect which the Judge is bound  to
       and did in this case consider.

   23. We have already drawn attention to the Judge's conclusion at [88] of
       the Decision that both [VO] and [BHO] would be "severely  negatively
       impacted" by the Appellant's deportation.  Mr  Lindsay  referred  to
       this as evidence that the Judge had applied the wrong  test  to  the
       impact on [BHO].  He made a further point in this regard.   He  said
       that the reference at the start of that paragraph to "the real world
       scenario" is clearly taken from KO (Nigeria) and is relevant only to
       the issue whether it is reasonable to expect a child to leave the UK
       (applying Section 117B (6)).  We accept that in the  context  of  KO
       (Nigeria), this is so. However, our understanding of what the  Judge
       was there saying is that, if the Appellant were to be deported,  the
       expectation would be that [VO] and [BHO] would remain.  Even  if  we
       are wrong about that, any error is not material.  The Judge  had  by
       then already found that the effect of  the  Appellant's  deportation
       for [BHO] would be unduly harsh which is sufficient in this case for
       the Appellant to succeed.

   24. Finally, we touch on two further points  arising  from  the  pleaded
       case and in response to Mr Moriarty's submissions.

   25. First, although Mr Lindsay did  not  deal  orally  with  the  ground
       concerning the support which [BHO] would have from  his  mother  and
       other agencies, Mr Moriarty drew our attention to  the  evidence  in
       that regard.  Although the Respondent says in the skeleton  argument
       that the evidence from the school was  that  [BHO]'s  behaviour  had
       improved following his biological father's  death,  as  Mr  Moriarty
       pointed out, this was with the support of "his very  caring  family"
       ([83]) which includes the Appellant.  The  letter  from  the  school
       goes on to point to the re-emergence of the same behaviour which the
       school  considered  to  be  "directly  linked"  to  the  Appellant's
       detention. Although we accept  that  the  evidence  shows  that  the
       family has the benefit of the support of other agencies which may be
       able to assist to support [VO] and [BHO], the Judge was entitled  to
       have regard to evidence  which  pointed  to  [BHO]'s  need  for  the
       presence of the Appellant in particular.

   26. Second, Mr Moriarty drew our attention to the case of  Secretary  of
       State for the Home Department v JG  (Jamaica  [2019]  EWCA  Civ  982
       which he said was analogous to, if not  less  compelling  than,  the
       instant case. As Mr Lindsay pointed out,  though,  the  Tribunal  is
       rarely assisted by a comparison between  the  facts  of  cases.   We
       accept that the reliance which the Respondent seeks to place  on  PG
       (Jamaica) is not of the same nature; she relies upon that  case  for
       what it has to say about the relevant test.  In this case,  however,
       we are quite satisfied that the  Judge  applied  the  correct  test,
       recognised the high threshold which applies and reached a conclusion
       which was open to her  that  the  threshold  was  satisfied  on  the
       evidence for the reasons she gave.

      CONCLUSIONS

   27. For those reasons, we are satisfied that there is no material  error
       of law disclosed by the Respondent's grounds.  We  therefore  uphold
       the Decision  with  the  consequence  that  the  Appellant's  appeal
       remains allowed.
