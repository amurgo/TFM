Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr T Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Jay Gajjar of Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. The  appellant  in  this  case  is  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the
    respondents are Mr Bashir and Mrs Asim.  However, for the  purposes  of
    this decision and reasons I refer to the parties as  they  were  before
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  where  Mr  Bashir  and  Mrs  Asim  were  the
    appellants.

 2. The first appellant is a national of Pakistan who appealed to the First-
    tier Tribunal against the decision of the respondent dated 13  February
    2018 to refuse his application for indefinite leave to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom based upon long  residence.   The  second  appellant  is
    dependent upon her husband the first appellant.  The case turns on  the
    fact that the respondent  found  that  the  application  of  the  first
    appellant fell for refusal under paragraph 322(5)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 3. Paragraph 322(5) provides, one of the Grounds on which leave to  remain
    and variation of leave to remain in the United Kingdom should  normally
    be refused, as follows:

         "... the undesirability  of  permitting  the  person  concerned  to
         remain in the United Kingdom in the light of his conduct (including
         convictions which do not fall within paragraph 322(1C)),  character
         or associations or the fact that he represents a threat to national
         security."

 4. This was because as part of the appellants' Tier 1 (General)  leave  to
    remain application of 25 March 2011 the appellant claimed  to  have  an
    income of �52,080.50 from all sources between  23  April  2010  and  28
    February 2011,  including  �14,501.49  from  Pay  As  You  Earn  (PAYE)
    employment and �37,554.75 from self-employment.  However, the appellant
    completed a tax questionnaire in 2017 and a revised tax calculation for
    2010/2011 dated 20 June 2016 shows the appellant initially  declared  a
    total income received of �14,757 including �10,407 from PAYE and �4,380
    from self-employment.

 5. On the basis of the original earnings declared to HMRC of  �14,767  the
    respondent confirmed that the appellant would have received  no  points
    for previous earnings and the respondent also noted that the  appellant
    amended the figures declared to HMRC on 16 February  2016  to  a  total
    income received of �50,316, including �17,898  from  PAYE  and  �32,418
    from self-employment.  The accompanying HMRC tax assessment  letter  of
    20 June 2016 stated that the appellant only made contact with  HMRC  on
    16 February 2016 and that the appellant was asked to pay an  additional
    �11,148.37 in  tax  as  a  result.   The  delay  of  several  years  in
    correcting the declaration to HMRC indicated, in the respondent's view,
    that the appellant had little intention of correcting  the  errors  and
    the respondent did not accept the appellant's explanation that the fact
    that the appellant's wife was undergoing fertility treatment was a good
    excuse.

 6. In a decision promulgated on 8 October 2018  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Swinnerton allowed the appellants' appeals.

 7. The Secretary of  State  appealed  with  permission  on  the  following
    grounds that:

      1) the First-tier Tribunal made a material misdirection of law in  its
         approach to whether the appellant had acted dishonestly by  placing
         significant emphasis on the fact that  HMRC  had  not  imposed  any
         penalty  or  taken  any  action  against  the  appellant  and   the
         respondent relied on  the  judicial  review  cases  of  R  (on  the
         application of Samant) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
         [2017] UKAITUR JR/6546/2016 and Abbasi JR/13807/2016; and

      2) failure to take into  account  and  resolve  conflict  of  fact  or
         opinion on material matters; in relation to whether  the  appellant
         may have inflated his income for visa purposes.

 8. Although Mr Lindsay attempted to introduce additional grounds of appeal
    it was not established before me that the new points made by Mr Lindsay
    were Robinson obvious.  In considering whether a ground not advanced in
    the application for permission should be considered I am not  satisfied
    that the grounds were ones which have a strong prospect of  success  or
    that the grounds relate to a decision which if undisturbed would breach
    the United Kingdom's international Treaty obligations or that  the  new
    grounds relate  to  an  issue  of  general  importance  (see  including
    AZ(error of law: jurisdiction; PTA practice)  Iran  [2018]  UKUT  00245
    (IAC)).

 9. Mr Lindsay relied on the guidance in the judicial review of R  (on  the
    application of Khan v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    (Dishonesty,  tax  return  paragraph  322(5)  [2018]  UKUT  00384.   In
    particular Mr Lindsay took me to paragraph 37 of that  case  which  set
    out the guidance in these cases and which differed from  the  headnote.
    It was Mr Lindsay's case that given that the case provided at (v):

         "Where an issue arises as to whether an error in relation to a  tax
         return has been honest or merely careless, the Secretary  of  State
         is obliged to consider the evidence pointing in each direction and,
         in her decision, to justify her conclusion  by  reference  to  that
         evidence.  In those circumstances  as  long  as  the  reasoning  is
         rational  and  the  evidence  has  been  properly  considered,  the
         decision of the Secretary of State cannot be impugned."

10. It was Mr Lindsay's submission that the First-tier  Tribunal  ought  to
    have dismissed the appeal on the basis that the Secretary of State  had
    properly considered the decision in the case including all the  factors
    pointing in each direction in the refusal letter.

11. Even if that ground were properly before me, which I am  not  satisfied
    it was, it is not made out.  The headnote makes no such reference and I
    am satisfied that the guidance at paragraph 37 is specifically directed
    to the circumstances where it is being considered, for judicial  review
    purposes, whether or not the Secretary of State  has  made  a  rational
    decision.

12. It is incumbent  on  the  First-tier  Tribunal  or  other  fact-finding
    Tribunal to consider all  the  evidence  and  reach  findings  on  that
    evidence.  Such an exercise cannot be fettered in the manner  suggested
    by Mr Lindsay, whereby the First-tier Tribunal is, in effect,  required
    to accept the decision of the respondent as to dishonesty  in  relation
    to a tax return.  The purported new ground is misconceived.

13. Similarly, although Mr Lindsay submitted that the judge had  failed  to
    consider, as set out at page 4 of the reasons for refusal letter,  that
    there had been a delay of several years in the appellant rectifying his
    tax matters and the judge had failed to make findings on this  was  not
    in the respondent's grounds of appeal.  In any event, even if it  were,
    I am not satisfied it was made out as the judge clearly had in mind all
    the relevant factors including the delay as  set  out  in  the  judge's
    recitation of the reasons for refusal at paragraphs [3] to [7]  of  the
    decision and reasons.  The judge also specifically  indicated  at  [19]
    that he had considered  all  the  documentary  evidence,  even  if  not
    specifically referred to and specifically considered the issue  of  the
    amended tax return.

14. Any failure to specifically reference the delay cannot  be  a  material
    error in the  circumstances  where  the  judge  found  the  appellant's
    general explanation to be credible.  For the avoidance of doubt, I also
    reject Mr Lindsay's primary submission that  this  was  an  appeal  not
    properly capable of succeeding given his interpretation of the guidance
    cited at paragraph 37(v) of the case in Khan.

15. In relation to the grounds that were before me, I am satisfied that the
    First-tier Tribunal did not place excessive weight on HMRC's actions in
    this case.  The judge conducted an examination of all of  the  evidence
    including the fact that the  first  appellant  was  not  subject  to  a
    penalty by HMRC, but that was not the end of  the  matter.   The  judge
    took into consideration that the HMRC had characterised the appellant's
    failure to provide an amended tax return in good time as "a failure  to
    take reasonable care".  The judge agreed with that assessment.

16. I take into consideration that the judge properly directed  himself  as
    to the guidance in Khan and the factors set out by  Mr  Justice  Martin
    Spencer which are recorded as follows in the headnote (v):

         "When considering whether or not  the  appellant  is  dishonest  or
         merely  careless  the  Secretary  of  State  should  consider   the
         following matters, inter alia, as well as the extent to which  they
         are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):

          i) Whether the explanation for the error  by  the  accountant  is
             plausible;

         ii) Whether the documentation which can be assumed to  exist  (for
             example,  correspondence  between  the   appellant   and   his
             accountant at the time of the tax return) has  been  disclosed
             or there is a plausible explanation for why it is missing;

        iii) Why the appellant did not realise that an error had been  made
             because his liability to pay tax was less than he should  have
             expected;

         iv) Whether, at any stage, the appellant has taken steps to remedy
             the situation and, if so, when those steps were taken and  the
             explanation for any significant delay."

17. The First-tier Tribunal followed that guidance and at [21]  found  that
    the Respondent was  entitled  to  draw  an  inference  that  the  first
    appellant had been deceitful and dishonest  and  the  judge  took  into
    consideration that this was the appellant's first year of trading  from
    2010 to 2011, that he had some bookkeeping knowledge but was not  well-
    versed in  tax  matters  and  had  relied  on  the  experience  of  his
    accountant, although he acknowledged that he had checked the tax return
    and that he had been distracted and preoccupied by his wife's fertility
    treatment and the circumstances around it.

18. The judge took into consideration that the first appellant had  clearly
    underdeclared a significant amount of income and was  now  required  to
    pay the tax  back.   It  was  the  judge's  findings  that  whilst  the
    appellant had failed to take reasonable care in his  behaviour  towards
    his tax matters it was reasonable to accept that  he  would  have  been
    distracted by the fertility treatment.  It was open  to  the  judge  to
    take into consideration  as  he  did,  as  a  factor,  that  the  first
    appellant had not had to amend any other tax returns  other  than  from
    2010/2011 and that he was not subject to any penalty.

19. The judge also had clearly in mind that the appellant had  taken  steps
    to remedy the delay and had given an explanation to remedy the  mistake
    and had given an explanation for it, which the judge accepted.

20. It was open to the judge to find as he did at [22] that  the  appellant
    had not been dishonest having considered "all the circumstances of this
    case".  It cannot properly be said that in making that  fact  sensitive
    assessment  the  judge  ought  to  have  completely  ignored  the  HMRC
    assessment.  Although not  determinative,  the  absence  of  a  penalty
    imposed  by  HMRC  is  not  necessarily  irrelevant  in   relation   to
    consideration as the issue of deception.  I take into consideration the
    authorities relied on by the Secretary of State of  Samant  and  Abbasi
    (see above) which were assessing whether the respondent's decisions had
    been rational in finding that  the  individuals  have  been  dishonest.
    Whilst neither of the judges in those cases (which were  considered  by
    Mr Justice Spencer in Khan) concluded that the Secretary of  State  had
    been irrational, that cannot bind another  decision  maker  in  placing
    some weight on the HMRC's actions in a particular case.

21. This case is also  distinguishable  from  Samant  where  there  was  no
    information from the HMRC in that case as to its thinking  by  contrast
    to the current case where the HMRC did assess the  appellant's  conduct
    and found it to be a failure to have taken reasonable care.

22. Whilst another judge may have reached a different decision,  the  judge
    gave adequate reasons for placing the weight on  the  matters  he  did,
    including considering in the round the  approach  of  the  HMRC.   That
    cannot be said to be irrational and is sustainable.  The  first  ground
    of appeal is not made out.

23. In relation to the second ground of appeal in the respondent's grounds,
    it is evident from the decision that the First-tier Tribunal was  aware
    of the Secretary of State's basis for refusal, including the allegation
    that the respondent had alternatively inflated his income in  order  to
    secure leave to remain.  It is relevant that the judge clearly accepted
    the appellant as credible for the reasons he  gave  and  there  was  no
    specific challenge in the Secretary of State's grounds of appeal to the
    judge's findings that the appellant would have been distracted  at  the
    time of the tax return because of the family issues; nor is the overall
    positive credibility finding specifically challenged.

24. Although Mr Gajjar produced a new document (which was the  respondent's
    reply to a Subject Access Request for a copy of the case record of  the
    consideration of the first appellant's 2011  application)  I  have  not
    attached any weight to this document.  Although Mr Lindsay on  the  one
    hand  did  not  make  any  specific  objection   to   the   appellants'
    representative  submitting  this  to  the  Tribunal   he   subsequently
    indicated that he was prejudiced by not having considered it.   I  have
    therefore disregarded it.

25. However, I have considered  the  submissions  of  Mr  Gajjar  that  the
    appellant was granted leave in 2011 which would only have occurred as a
    result of the Secretary of State's scrutiny of all the evidence  before
    her including the evidence of income.  Mr Gajjar relied on the grant of
    leave as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant dated 20th  April  2011  which  was
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

26. I accept Mr Gajjar's submission  that  the  initial  burden  of  proof,
    insofar as dishonesty is concerned, is with  the  Secretary  of  State.
    Whilst,  as  confirmed  by  Khan,  a  significant  discrepancy  may  be
    sufficient for a prima facie inference of dishonesty in respect of  the
    HMRC, I take into account that  the  appellants'  previous  immigration
    application and  the  evidence  of  earnings  were  accepted  following
    careful scrutiny and that the HMRC's view was that  the  appellant  had
    been careless in his tax matters rather than dishonest.

27. I also note in passing that although  the  Presenting  Officer  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal relied on the reasons for  refusal  there  were  no
    specific submissions made (and it was not suggested that the  recording
    by the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  anything  other  than  accurate)  in
    relation to the claim that  the  appellant  had  falsely  inflated  his
    income in order to obtain leave in 2011.

28. The second ground of appeal is not made out.  The judge was entitled to
    find, for the evidence-based reasons he gave, that the  respondent  had
    failed to establish that the appellant's conduct fell within  paragraph
    322(5).
