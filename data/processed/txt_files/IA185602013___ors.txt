Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr Lee (20 June 2014) and Mr Biggs (5 September
                    2014), Counsel instructed by TSA Law
For the Respondent:    Mr Tarlow, Specialist Appeals Team





                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants appeal to the Upper Tribunal the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing the first appellant's appeal against a refusal
    of leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  The second  and
    third appellants  are  his  wife  and  child  respectively,  and  their
    applications for leave to remain as his dependants were refused in line
    with the rejection of his application.  The First-tier Tribunal did not
    make an anonymity order, and I do not consider that such  an  order  is
    required for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. As the first appellant is the main appellant in this  appeal,  I  shall
    hereafter refer to him simply as the appellant save where  the  context
    otherwise requires.  The appellant is a national of  Bangladesh,  whose
    date of birth is 31 December 1981.   He  first  landed  in  the  United
    Kingdom on 2 July 2005 with valid entry clearance as  a  student.   His
    last grant of leave to remain as a student expired on 30 January  2011.
    On 2 November 2010 he was granted leave to remain until 2 November 2012
    as a Tier 1 post-study worker.

 3. On 31 October 2012 the appellant applied for leave to remain as a  Tier
    1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  In his application form, he said he was part
    of an entrepreneurial team.  His entrepreneurial  team  member  was  Mr
    Saidul Islam, also a national of Bangladesh.  At G10, he  indicated  he
    was relying on access to a total sum of money of �50,000 in Lloyds  TSB
    Bank.  At Q20, he indicated he was relying on a printout of  a  current
    appointment report from Companies House showing him listed as a company
    director.

 4. His application was presented with the assistance of  a  caseworker  at
    Universal Solicitors.  In section 7, the representative provided a list
    of  the  documents  that  were  being  provided  in  support   of   the
    application.  This list included the following: job contract agreement;
    business bank statements for three months; personal bank statements for
    three months; business website page; business  advertising  on  Gumtree
    (one page); agreement for accountancy and tax consultancy services;  an
    accountant's cover letter; a CT41GC; a current  appointment  report;  a
    business registration certificate; representative cover letter;  and  a
    business proposal.

 5. In the respondent's bundle in my file, which  was  compiled  on  7  May
    2013,  the  following  documents  provided  with  the  application  are
    annexed: Lloyds TSB Bank statements for IMSI (UK) Ltd; ABC Book-keeping
    and Accountancy agreement dated 17 August 2012;  ABC  Book-keeping  and
    Accountancy letter dated  22  October  2012;  advertising  materials  -
    printout of advert on Gumtree and  printout  of  company  website;  and
    business contract between AMSI (UK) Ltd and Mr Zuhurul Islam.

 6. The Lloyds TSB Bank statements showed that the appellant had  paid  the
    sum of �22,000 in September 2012 into the bank account of AMSI (UK) Ltd
    held at the Lloyds TSB Branch in Victoria Docks, London E16.  The total
    balance in the account as of 28 September 2012 was �33,308.70.

 7. In a letter dated 22 October 2012 Mr Ashraf Pervez of ABC  Book-keeping
    and Accountancy confirmed that the appellant and Mr Saidul  Islam  each
    held 50 shares of �1  each  in  AMSI  (UK)  Ltd  ("the  company").   He
    continued: "From the verification of the company bank accounts (copy of
    statement enclosed) we also confirm that Mr Islam and  Mahmud  invested
    �50,000 in the proposed business, in which Mr Islam and Mr  Adnan  have
    equal access".

 8. A set of company bank accounts was not included with  the  application,
    and it is not clear what he meant by "copy of statement enclosed".

The Reasons for Refusal

 9. On 7 May 2013 the Secretary of State gave her reasons for refusing  the
    application, and for making a decision to remove the appellant from the
    UK by way of directions under Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and
    Nationality Act 2006.

10. The appellant claimed 25 points for access to funds as  required  under
    paragraph 245DD(b) of Appendix A of the Rules.   But  he  had  provided
    insufficient evidence with his application.   For  invested  funds,  he
    needed to provide  a  company  bank  statement,  audited  or  unaudited
    accounts and a letter of confirmation from a regulated accountant.

11. He had provided a company bank statement showing that he had �50,000 of
    funds.  As this was in the company's  name,  he  had  also  to  provide
    audited or unaudited accounts and also a letter of confirmation from  a
    regulated accountant to show that he and his team member  had  invested
    the funds.

12. He had provided an accountant's letter, and the accountant  claimed  to
    be registered with ACCA.  But it had been confirmed by ACCA that "they"
    were not.  So the accountant's letter was not  acceptable  evidence  to
    show the funds had been invested.

13. In addition, he had not provided any accounts to  show  the  investment
    made by the appellant directly.  He also did not meet the  requirements
    for non-invested funds.

14. There  was  also  insufficient  evidence  of  business  activity.   The
    business contract he provided did not specifically describe the service
    which was provided by the  business,  and  also  did  not  include  the
    contact details of the other party involved.  In addition  to  this  he
    had  not  provided  sufficient  advertising  material.   As  previously
    stated, this should  include  his  name,  business  name  and  business
    activity.   Unfortunately  the  business  activity  described  in   the
    advertising did not reflect the job title he had provided.

The Grounds of Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

15. The appellant instructed new solicitors to assist him in his appeal for
    the First-tier Tribunal.  They settled lengthy grounds of appeal on his
    behalf.  They acknowledged that his previous legal representatives  had
    failed to submit unaudited accounts with the application.   However  on
    22 April  2013  the  appellant  had  sent  unaudited  accounts,  a  new
    advertisement and a revised service agreement in line with  the  Rules.
    The respondent failed to consider those relevant  documents,  and  this
    amounted to an arguable error of law.

16. It was also not true that the appellant's accountant was not registered
    with ACCA.  He obviously was a member of ACCA,  as  he  had  given  his
    membership number of 0910859.

The Additional Evidence provided by way of Appeal

17. For the purposes  of  the  hearing  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the
    appellant's  solicitors  compiled  a  bundle  containing  a  membership
    certificate for Mr Ashraf  Pervez,  company  bank  statement,  business
    contracts, business adverts, and an  accountant's  certificate,  report
    and accounts.  The bundle also included a determination of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal (Judge Andonian) allowing the appeal of Mr  Saidul  Islam
    against the refusal of his application for leave to remain as a Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant.

18. Mr Islam's application had been refused on 13 May 2013.  The grounds of
    refusal were identical to those that  had  been  deployed  against  the
    appellant.  At paragraph 11, Judge Andonian held  that  the  respondent
    had not properly considered the accountant's details.   He  found  that
    the Company accountants were members of the FSA and ACCA.

19. Judge Andonian went on to hold that it was very clear from the evidence
    before him that �50,000 was equally held between the two team  members.
    This was evidenced in the documents provided by the accountants and the
    company information.  In addition, if the respondent was not  satisfied
    with the information that had been provided,  she  had  the  option  of
    making a simple telephone call or writing by letter or email to request
    some  clarification  in  accordance  with  her  evidential  flexibility
    policy.

20. As to the contract, if it  was  not  in  the  format  required  by  the
    respondent, then one of her agents could have contacted  Mr  Islam  and
    advised him as to its deficiencies.  The further information could then
    have been provided.  He allowed Mr Islam's appeal under the Rules.

21. The appellant's bundle contained a set of bank statements  relating  to
    the Company.  The bank statement in the respondent's bundle (see above)
    was to be found at page  32.   At  page  31,  there  was  another  bank
    statement in respect of the same account running from 14 August 2012 to
    19 October 2012.  This showed that as a result of a series of deposits,
    mainly by an entity called "Eastern" the balance  in  the  account  had
    risen to just over �50,000 on 19 October 2012.

22. At page 52 onwards of the appellant's bundle, there  was  a  management
    report and accounts for the company dated 31 March 2013.  According  to
    these accounts, the appellant and Mr Islam each held 25,000  �1  shares
    in the company.

23. The principal activities of the company during the year continued to be
    the import of IT, computer and electronic equipment  and  resale.   The
    report was approved by the board on 13 May 2013.   A  profit  and  loss
    account for the company for the period 26 July 2012 to  31  March  2013
    showed a zero turnover.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

24. The appellant's appeal came before Judge Lawrence sitting in the First-
    tier Tribunal at Hatton Cross on 18 December 2013.  The appellants were
    represented by Mr T Aziz of TSA Law, and the  Secretary  of  State  was
    represented by Ms L Baines, Counsel.  The appellant  was  called  as  a
    witness, and was cross-examined by Ms Baines on the  documents  in  the
    appellant's bundle.  He accepted that the set of accounts he relied  on
    (at pages 54 onwards) were not approved when they were submitted to the
    respondent.  They were approved on 13 May 2013,  which  was  after  the
    date of decision.

25. He accepted that the advertisements at pages 49 and 50  of  the  bundle
    had not been submitted with the application, and  he  thought  he  sent
    them after the date of decision.

26. The appellant was asked about a Technical  Support  Services  Agreement
    dated 7 March 2013, at pages 44 to 47 of the  bundle.   This  agreement
    was between the company and Mr Bhuiyan.  His address, telephone  number
    and email address were given in the document.   He  had  not  submitted
    this contract to the respondent.  The contract with "Islam" was for one
    year, but Mr Islam had terminated the contract after six months in June
    2013.

27. In his subsequent determination, Judge Lawrence records  the  appellant
    as having given evidence that the contract at pages 44 to 47  purported
    to "amend" the contract between the Company  and,  by  implication,  Mr
    Zuhurul Islam.  It is convenient to note at this stage that this is not
    what is recorded in the judge's manuscript note of the proceedings, and
    clearly the contract at pages 44 to 47 is not with Mr Zuhurul Islam but
    someone else by a different name.

28. In re-examination, the appellant is recorded as giving evidence that he
    had submitted  "the  additional  information",  including  the  amended
    contract, on 22 April 2013.

29. The judge's findings are set  out  in  paragraphs  15  onwards  of  his
    determination, promulgated on 7 January 2014.  He did  not  accept  the
    evidence of the appellant that he had submitted additional evidence  in
    the correct form to the Secretary of  State  before  the  date  of  her
    decision.  The burden of proof rested with the appellant to show  this,
    and the post office receipt which he had provided at  the  hearing  was
    insufficient to discharge this burden of  proof.   In  any  event,  the
    judge held that the appellant had to send all  the  requisite  evidence
    with his application, and not supply it in a piecemeal fashion.

30. The judge went on to deal with Mr Aziz's argument on the application of
    the evidential flexibility policy.  The judge made the following ruling
    at paragraph 22:

         The Tribunal is  not  in  a  position  to  verify  or  authenticate
         information contained in the documents submitted  to  the  Tribunal
         with the appeal.  The Rules require an applicant to submit evidence
         to the respondent with the application  for  a  good  reason.   The
         reason is the respondent has the task and responsibility to  verify
         the information contained in them.  The Tribunal has no such  task.
         The Tribunal is equipped,  for  example,  to  determine  whether  a
         particular document was submitted with the application but  has  no
         means  of  determining  whether  the  evidence  contained  in   any
         particular document is authentic.  It therefore cannot accede to Mr
         Aziz's submission that I should act on the fresh evidence submitted
         to the Tribunal.

31. The judge went on to address the assertion by the  Secretary  of  State
    that the accountant relied by the appellant was not a member  of  ACCA.
    He observed that the respondent ought to have provided evidence of  any
    response obtained from ACCA.  Mr Aziz relied on  the  determination  of
    Judge Andonian in support of the contention  that  the  accountant  was
    indeed a member of ACCA.  But there was no evidence that  Mr  Aziz  had
    sought permission  from  the  relevant  persons  or  bodies  before  he
    disclosed this information to the Tribunal.  Also he did not know  what
    evidence was submitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  in  support  of  Mr
    Islam's appeal.  So he did not attach any weight  to  Judge  Andonian's
    determination.

The Eventual Grant of Permission to Appeal

32. The appellant applied for permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal,
    raising a number of grounds of appeal.  The application was refused  by
    the First-tier Tribunal,  but  permission  was  granted  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Dawson on 30 April  2014.  Judge  Dawson's  reasons  for
    granting permission were as follows:

         Having found at [10] the applicant was lacking a  good  command  of
         English, it is arguable  that  the  conclusion  at  [15]  that  the
         appellant reluctantly accepted his application did not contain  all
         the requisite information either because he was evasive or  because
         his English was inadequate required  the  judge  to  explain  which
         characteristic undermined the credibility.  If the latter, then  it
         is arguable the judge should not have given such weight to what was
         said at the hearing.

         It is also arguable the judge failed to explain how he factored  in
         the failure by the SSHD to provide a  bundle  in  deciding  not  to
         accept that further material had not been sent prior to decision.

         The other grounds have less arguable merit in them, but  permission
         is granted on all.

         It will be for the Upper Tribunal to  decide  when  considering  if
         there  is  an  error,  whether,  even  if  the  SSHD  had  received
         additional material prior to decision, she was required to take  it
         into account.

The Hearing on 20 June 2014

33. At the hearing in  the  Upper  Tribunal,  I  received  some  additional
    evidence that was not before the First-tier Tribunal.

34. I was shown a letter apparently sent by Universal Solicitors to the  UK
    Border Agency in Sheffield on 22 April 2013 in respect of the appellant
    and Mr Saidul  Islam.   The  solicitors  said  they  were  sending  the
    following documents in support of their client's application:

         1.   updated marketing material;

         2.   sales contracts;

         3.   unaudited accounts with details of shareholdings.

35. I was also shown a track and trace document  indicating  that  an  item
    with a designated reference number was  delivered  from  the  Sheffield
    delivery office on 23 April 2013.  I have since checked  the  reference
    given in the track and trace document  with  that  given  in  the  post
    office receipt that was before the First-tier Tribunal, and I  am  able
    to confirm that the reference number is the same.

36. On behalf of the Secretary of State,  Mr  Tarlow  accepted  there  were
    errors in the determination.  But he submitted  that  the  errors  were
    immaterial to the conclusion.  There were some documents which  had  to
    be provided with the application, and at least  one  of  these  crucial
    documents had not been: this was a document saying the amount of  money
    available to each team member.

37.  For  the  appellant,  Mr  Lee  submitted  that  the  errors   in   the
    determination were so widespread that the appellant had in effect  been
    deprived of  a  fair  hearing.   Alternatively,  there  was  sufficient
    evidence to show that the refusal decision was not in  accordance  with
    the law, and the application should be remitted  to  the  Secretary  of
    State for  fresh  consideration.   He  submitted  that  the  favourable
    determination of Judge Andonian in respect of the other entrepreneurial
    team member, and the  subsequent  grant  of  leave  to  remain  by  the
    Secretary of State to Mr Islam, meant that it  was  difficult  for  the
    Secretary of State to justify the appellant being  treated  differently
    from Mr Islam.

Resons for Finding an Error of Law

38. The appellant's bundle contained documentary evidence indicative of  Mr
    Pervez's membership of ACCA.  In addition, the judge had before  him  a
    determination of Judge Andonian in which the judge had accepted that he
    was a member of ACCA.  Conversely, the respondent had not provided  any
    evidence to support the assertion made in  the  refusal  decision  that
    ACCA had confirmed Mr Pervez was not registered with them.

39. Judge Lawrence addresses the question of the accountant's membership of
    ACCA in paragraph 24 of his determination.  He  acknowledges  that  the
    respondent has failed  to  provide  evidence  to  support  the  alleged
    response from ACCA in response to an  enquiry  about  the  accountant's
    membership.  The judge goes on to refer to the determination  of  Judge
    Andonian.  But he attaches no weight to the determination for  the  two
    reasons referred to in paragraph 31 above.

40. I do not consider  that  the  first  reason  given  by  the  judge  for
    attaching no weight to the  contents  of  the  determination  of  Judge
    Andonian stands up to scrutiny.  The  hearing  of  the  entrepreneurial
    team member's appeal took place in open court and the determination  of
    Judge Andonian is a public document, albeit that in  practice  the  co-
    operation of the entrepreneurial team member would have  been  required
    in order for the appellant to gain  access  to  it.   Since  they  were
    supposedly fellow directors in a business which they had set up, it was
    strongly to be inferred that the determination was  being  deployed  in
    the appellant's appeal with the express consent of his  entrepreneurial
    team member. So the judge was wrong not to take it into account on  the
    ground that the appellant needed first to show that he had the  express
    consent of the Tribunal or his team member to deploy it.

41. With regards to the second objection, it is of  course  true  that  the
    judge did not know what evidence Judge Andonian had seen.  But  it  was
    reasonably to  be  inferred  that  the  same  evidence  that  had  been
    successfully deployed in the appeal of the entrepreneurial team  member
    was also being relied upon in the instant appeal; and prima  facie  the
    judge fails to take account of this evidence, which is included in  the
    appellant's bundle. He makes no mention of it.

42. In conclusion, I find that the judge has not given adequate reasons for
    resolving the issue of the accountant's membership of ACCA against  the
    appellant.

43. With regard to the other deficiencies in the application identified  in
    the refusal letter, the appellant's case before the First-tier Tribunal
    was  that  these  deficiencies  were  rectified  by  the  provision  of
    additional documents under cover of a letter from the solicitors  dated
    22 April 2013.  This aspect of the appellant's case raises a number  of
    sub-issues: was anything sent at all? If so, precisely what  additional
    documents were sent? Having identified  these,  was  the  Secretary  of
    State required to take into account all the additional  documents  when
    making a decision on the application, or some of them or none of them?

44. With regards to the  first  sub-issue,  the  appellant  relies  on  the
    evidence provided by way of appeal to the Upper Tribunal to  show  that
    the judge made a mistake of fact in resolving this issue  against  him.
    But he has not shown that with reasonable diligence this evidence could
    not have been deployed before the First-tier Tribunal.

45. Nonetheless, I am persuaded  that  the  judge  did  not  give  adequate
    reasons for his adverse conclusion on the  first  sub-issue,  which  he
    reached upon more  limited  evidence  than  is  now  available  to  me.
    Although in the early stages of his determination it looks  as  if  the
    judge might be minded to make an adverse  credibility  finding  against
    the appellant, he does not in the event do so.  He  appears  to  accept
    that the appellant's apparent inability to answer clear  questions  put
    to him by Ms Baines is at least equally likely to flow  from  the  fact
    that he has a poor command of the English language.

46. Accordingly, his rejection of  the  appellant's  evidence  that  he/his
    previous solicitors sent additional documents on 22 April 2013  is  not
    underpinned by a finding that the appellant is not a witness of  truth.
    Furthermore, it was not apparently disputed  that  the  PO  Box  number
    given on the post office receipt produced at the hearing is the correct
    PO Box address for communications with the respondent in respect  of  a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant application.

47. Having (wrongly) resolved the first sub-issue  against  the  appellant,
    the judge did not adequately engage with either the second or the third
    sub-issues. Of particular significance is the judge's treatment of  the
    question of evidential flexibility.  At the end of  paragraph  20,  the
    judge finds that the appellant has to send all the  requisite  evidence
    with his application.  While this is the general rule,  the  evidential
    flexibility policy as codified in paragraph 245AA of the Rules does not
    preclude  the  respondent  requesting  in   appropriate   circumstances
    additional information or documents;  or  the  respondent  taking  into
    account additional information and documents that have been volunteered
    by a PBS applicant between the date of  application  and  the  date  of
    eventual decision.

48. As I explored with Mr Lee in the course of  oral  argument,  there  are
    some specified documents that must have come into existence by the date
    of application. But this  constraint  does  not  necessarily  apply  to
    additional contracts and advertising material.

49. If the answer to the second sub-issue was clear to me (what  additional
    documents were provided?) I would  be  able  to  perform  the  exercise
    envisaged by Judge Dawson, and I would be able to make a finding on  Mr
    Tarlow's submission that  the  additional  material  was  incapable  of
    salvaging the appellant's position. As it is, this exercise  will  have
    to be postponed.

50. In conclusion, I find that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  was
    vitiated by a material error of law, such that it should be  set  aside
    and re-made.

Future Disposal

51. I considered that the Upper Tribunal was the appropriate forum for  the
    decision to be re-made.  I  did  not  accept  that  the  appellant  was
    deprived of a fair hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.  Furthermore,  I
    did not consider it necessary for the appeal to be re-heard de novo.  I
    considered  that  the  appropriate  starting  point  was  Mr   Tarlow's
    concession that the question of the  accountant's  membership  of  ACCA
    should have been resolved in the appellant's favour.  So this ground of
    objection in the refusal decision fell away.

52. The factual inquiry which was outstanding was precisely what,  if  any,
    relevant specified documents were posted to the respondent on 22  April
    2013;  and  (from  the  respondent's  perspective)  whether  they  were
    received; and, if so, why they were ignored.

53. The oral evidence of the appellant was confused  and  contradictory  on
    the topic of what was sent, and the bundle which was prepared  for  the
    hearing  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  distinguish   between
    documents which clearly came into existence after the date of  decision
    (such as the approved unaudited accounts) and documents which are  said
    to have been provided on 22 April 2013.

54. I said I  would  be  assisted  by  the  respondent  producing  all  the
    documents submitted with the application, and any additional  specified
    documents held on the file.  For the avoidance of  doubt,  it  did  not
    appear to  be  the  case  that  the  respondent  failed  to  compile  a
    respondent's bundle for the hearing in the  First-tier  Tribunal.   But
    the respondent's bundle did not purport to contain  all  the  documents
    submitted with the application, and it  clearly  did  not  contain  any
    documents provided after the date of application.

The resumed hearing on 5 September 2014

55. For the purposes of this hearing, the appellant's solicitors compiled a
    fresh bundle of documents containing the documents which the  appellant
    said had been  enclosed  under  cover  of  the  letter  from  Universal
    Solicitors dated 22 April 2013.

56. The appellant adopted as his evidence-in-chief his witness statement in
    the bundle, and he was asked supplementary questions by Mr  Biggs.   He
    had personally attended at the offices of Universal  Solicitors  on  22
    April 2013, and had placed  the  enclosures  in  the  envelope  in  the
    presence of his solicitor.  He had then taken the letter  to  the  Post
    Office, and thus had obtained a Post Office receipt.  He had  submitted
    the original Post Office receipt to the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  The
    documents which he had enclosed were (a) the  online  advertisement  at
    page 74, (b) the contract with a customer dated 7 March 2013  at  pages
    70 to 73, and (c) the unaudited management report and accounts for Amsi
    (UK) Limited dated 31 March 2013 at pages 77 to 83.

57. The appellant was cross-examined about the following statement  at  the
    bottom of page 79: "This report was approved by the  board  on  13  May
    2013 and signed by its order."

58. The appellant  agreed  with  Mr  Tarlow  that  the  unaudited  accounts
    provided on 22 April 2013 could not have contained this statement.   He
    was asked when this statement was added.  He answered  he  had  kept  a
    photocopy of what he had sent to the Home Office, and he indicated that
    he had later substituted a new page 79, or that he had substituted  the
    set of accounts generated after the  board  meeting  of  13  May  2013.
    There were no board minutes approving the accounts.

59. In re-examination, he was asked whether he had kept a copy of  what  he
    had sent to the Home Office.  He answered maybe it was a mistake by the
    accountant. He confirmed that no board meeting had been arranged before
    he had submitted a set of accounts on 22 April 2013.  He was asked  why
    he had not provided a copy of the accounts that were actually submitted
    on 22 April 2013.  He said he did not have enough time  to  submit  the
    accounts.  He had obtained the set of accounts at pages 77 onwards from
    the accountants at a later stage.

60. In his closing submissions on  behalf  of  the  respondent,  Mr  Tarlow
    repeated his earlier concession about  the  accountant's  qualification
    and also  conceded  that  some  further  documents  were  sent  to  the
    Secretary of State under cover of the letter of 22 April 2013.  But  he
    did not specify which documents had been sent, and  he  submitted  that
    what was sent came too late. So the  Secretary  of  State  was  not  in
    breach of the evidential flexibility principles in not taking them into
    account.

61.  In  reply,  Mr  Biggs  referred  me  to  his  skeleton  argument.   He
    acknowledged that it was a difficulty about the statement at the bottom
    of page 79, but he submitted  that  on  balance  of  probabilities  the
    appellant had provided the documents identified by him under  cover  of
    the letter of 22 April 2013; and that  these  documents  satisfactorily
    filled in the gaps in terms of  compliance  with  paragraph  41-SD  and
    paragraph 46-SD (specified documents needed to establish the amount  of
    money that an applicant has already  invested).   The  failure  by  the
    respondent to consider the documents therefore fatally  undermined  the
    legality of her subsequent refusal decision.

62. The appeal should be allowed on the basis that the refusal decision  of
    7 May 2013 was unlawful on public  law  grounds.   If  there  were  any
    defects in the documents submitted, they  were  minor  and  within  the
    scope of the evidential flexibility discretion  under  paragraph  245AA
    and the respondent's policy.  In any event, there was no basis  in  the
    Rules for imposing a fixed timeline on  the  submission  of  documents,
    such as those in issue in the instant appeal.  The  Rules  in  question
    are very different from those considered in Secretary of State for  the
    Home Department v Raju and Others [2013] EWCA Civ 754.

63. Finally, Mr Biggs relied on Mr Islam's successful appeal, and the  fact
    that the respondent had since granted Mr Islam leave  to  remain  as  a
    Tier  1  Entrepreneur  Migrant.   In  the  light  of   the   favourable
    determination in Mr Islam's case, which the respondent had implemented,
    the respondent was bound by the principle of consistency  to  recognise
    that the appellant's application was genuine and met the requirement of
    the Rules, because it was identical  to  the  application  made  by  Mr
    Islam.  So the refusal decision of 7 May 2013  was  unlawful  as  being
    contrary to the principle of consistency.   In  any  event,  the  Upper
    Tribunal should treat the findings and conclusions in Mr  Islam's  case
    with appropriate respect and deference, and I should be guided  by  the
    principles in Devaseelan [2002] UKAIT 000702.

Discussion and Findings

64. Although the appellant's position is to some  extent  salvaged  by  the
    concessions made by Mr Tarlow, the evidence as to  what  precisely  was
    served  under  cover  of  the  letter  of   22   April   2013   remains
    unsatisfactory and I do not find the appellant to be a reliable witness
    on this topic.

65. In his witness statement for the First-tier Tribunal, dated 12 December
    2013, the appellant said at paragraph 6 that he had submitted  all  the
    required documents at the time of  making  his  application.   If  some
    documents were missed or in the wrong  format,  that  could  have  been
    rectified by contacting  him  or  his  representative  in  writing  and
    requesting the correct documents.

66. The fact that he did not mention in this witness statement that he  had
    sent additional documents under cover of letter of 22 April  2013,  and
    he did not complain that they had not been taken into account, tends to
    undermine the credibility of  his  assertion  that  he  was  personally
    involved in such a process or indeed that he became aware that any such
    process had taken place.

67. The second anomaly is that the covering letter refers to sale contracts
    (plural), but the appellant only claims  to  have  inserted  one  sales
    contract.

68. The third anomaly is that the document at page 74, which is a print-out
    of an online advertisement, does not have any  date  on  it  so  as  to
    demonstrate that it was printed off on either 21 or 22 April  2013,  as
    opposed to subsequently.  The search information  at  the  top  of  the
    page, which might have contained a date, is partially obscured  by  the
    appellant's business card.  Thus the document at page 74 is in  fact  a
    photocopy of two documents, the business card being superimposed on the
    advert.  The appellant's explanation for this is that he  inserted  his
    business card into the  envelope,  and  when  the  respondent  came  to
    compile the Home Office bundle for Mr Islam's appeal, the  case  worker
    concerned superimposed his business card  on  the  advertisement.   But
    there is no reference in  the  covering  letter  to  the  provision  of
    business cards as well as other material.

69. As the document at page 74 bears a page number consistent with it being
    included in the  Home  Office  bundle  for  Mr  Islam's  appeal,  I  am
    persuaded that it was provided to the  respondent  in  advance  of  the
    refusal decision, and I am prepared to  accept  that  it  was  provided
    under cover of the letter of 22 April. However, the presence of page 74
    in Mr Islam's Home Office bundle undermines the appellant's  case  that
    unaudited accounts were also sent with page 74.  For if they had  been,
    they are likely to have also been included in  Mr  Islam's  bundle  (so
    that the appellant would have been able to produce them in this appeal)
    and/or there would not have been the parallel assertion made against Mr
    Islam that no accounts had been provided.

70. Finally, there is conflicting evidence about the unaudited accounts.  I
    do not find the appellant credible in his assertion that he provided an
    earlier version of the accounts that are contained in the bundle.   The
    plain implication of the letter from Mr Pervez  dated  9  January  2014
    (page 55) is that he delivered the accounts  to  the  directors  on  15
    April 2013 with the statement at the bottom of page 79  included.   His
    justification for doing so  was  that  the  accounts  were  due  to  be
    approved by the board of directors on 13 May 2013 at a  board  meeting,
    "according to our information."

71. However, the appellant confirmed in his oral evidence that no date  for
    a board meeting had been set at the time when the accounts were sent on
    22 April 2013.  So, on his evidence, it would have been impossible  for
    Mr Pervez to have included such a statement in the  accounts.   At  the
    same time, the appellant has not produced the version of  the  accounts
    which was allegedly sent, and Mr Pervez in his statement of  9  January
    2014 does not suggest that an earlier version ever existed.

72. While  the  covering  letter  refers  to  unaudited  accounts,  on  the
    appellant's evidence the solicitors did not assume  responsibility  for
    the enclosures.  They left that task to the appellant.

73. The appellant's evidence below was equally unsatisfactory,  and  having
    taken all the relevant evidence into account, I find that the appellant
    is not a reliable witness on the question of what was sent under  cover
    of the letter of 22 April 2013, and I find that the cover letter cannot
    be taken at its face value. Some documents  were  sent,  including  the
    document at page 74, but the appellant has not shown that accounts were
    sent.

74. If I am wrong about that, the accounts which  were  supplied  were  not
    accounts which the Secretary of State could reasonably be  expected  to
    take into consideration.  On the face of it, the document provided  was
    a document which told a lie about itself.  It was not a report that had
    been approved by the board on 13 May 2013 and signed by its order.

75. On the same page, the following is  stated  in  respect  of  directors'
    responsibilities: "Under company law directors  must  not  approve  the
    accounts unless they are satisfied they give a true and  fair  view  of
    the state of the affairs of the company and of the profit  or  loss  of
    the company for that period (my emphasis)".   These  accounts  had  not
    been approved, as the Board had not yet met to approve them.

76. Moreover, the document does not meet the requirements of paragraph  46-
    SD.  Paragraph 46-SD(ii) provides that if the applicant's  business  is
    not required to produce audited accounts,  unaudited  accounts  and  an
    accountant's certificate of confirmation must  be  provided.   No  such
    certificate of confirmation was  provided  with  these  accounts  under
    cover of the letter of 22 April 2013.

77. Paragraph 46-SD(b) further provides the accounts must clearly show  the
    name of the accountant, the date the accounts were  produced,  and  how
    much the applicant has invested in the business.   The  date  that  the
    accounts have been produced is not indicated on the document.

78. Paragraph 245AA provides that the UK  Border  Agency/Home  Office  will
    only consider documents that have been submitted with the  application,
    and will only consider documents submitted after the application  where
    they are submitted in accordance with sub-paragraph (b).

79. It follows that if a document is not submitted in accordance with  sub-
    paragraph (b) there is prima  facie  no  breach  of  the  Rule  in  the
    respondent not taking that document  into  account.   The  evidence  of
    business activity provided with the application was deficient  for  the
    reasons set out earlier in this determination. The  problem  identified
    by the Secretary of State in  the  refusal  letter  was  not  that  the
    documents were in  the  wrong  format.   The  problem  was  a  lack  of
    mandatory information, such as contact details; and in the case of  the
    business contract,  there  was  an  asserted  failure  to  specifically
    describe the services which were provided  by  the  business.   Against
    this background, the additional evidence of business activity  provided
    in the letter of 22 April 2013 does not come within the scope  of  sub-
    paragraph (b) of paragraph 245AA.   It  is  not  repackaging  the  same
    evidence in the correct format.  It is presenting new evidence.

80. The unaudited accounts clearly do not fall within  the  scope  of  sub-
    paragraph (b).  For the appellant had not sought to provide  this  type
    of evidence with the application.  But he should have done, as  he  was
    asserting that he had invested the sum of �25,000 in the company  prior
    to the date of application. So the provision of unaudited  accounts  as
    evidence of such investment was a mandatory requirement under paragraph
    46-SD from the outset.

81. If (contrary to my primary finding) a set of accounts  was  sent  under
    the letter of 22 April 2013, the respondent was wrong to say  that  the
    appellant had not provided any accounts.  But there was  no  breach  of
    evidential flexibility principles or a common law duty of fairness,  as
    the appellant had still not  provided  a  specified  document:  namely,
    unaudited accounts which complied with the requirements of paragraph 46-
    SD.   As  previously  canvassed,  the   defects   in   the   accounting
    documentation are not minor, but are  highly  significant.   As  of  22
    April 2013 they were draft accounts which had not been approved by  the
    board, and in respect of which there was no certificate of confirmation
    from the accountants.

82. I take into account the fact that Judge  Andonian  allowed  Mr  Islam's
    appeal on evidence which in many respects was, or  is  likely  to  have
    been, identical to that relied on in this  appeal.   But  it  does  not
    appear to have been suggested in that appeal that the respondent failed
    to take into account documents which had been tendered under cover of a
    letter dated 22 April 2013.  The Judge proceeded on the premise that Mr
    Islam had provided sufficient documents with his  initial  application,
    and  that  the  Secretary  of  State  had  acted  unreasonably  in  not
    contacting Mr Islam for clarification in relation to  "any  matters  of
    mandatory requirement that she thought had not been properly  provided,
    and that she thought were not provided in terms of documents  being  in
    the appropriate format."

83. The Presenting Officer at the hearing argued that it was not a question
    of documents not being in the appropriate  format,  but  documents  not
    being made  available  at  all.   Judge  Andonian's  response  to  that
    submission was as follows: "With great respect, I cannot see that  from
    the voluminous evidence before me." So I gain no  assistance  from  his
    approach to Mr Islam's appeal in determining the discrete  issue  which
    has arisen in this appeal.

84. Accordingly, I find that the appellant  has  failed  to  discharge  the
    burden of proving that the refusal decision was not in accordance  with
    the Rules or was otherwise not in accordance  with  the  law.   I  find
    there was no common law unfairness in the Secretary of  State  refusing
    the application on the evidence  which  had  been  submitted,  and  not
    seeking further documents or clarification from  the  appellant  before
    making an adverse decision on his application.

85. The fact that the appellant has  failed  in  his  appeal,  whereas  his
    entrepreneurial team member has been successful,  raises  the  question
    whether the outcome is perverse, and  thus  whether  the  appellant  is
    entitled to any relief in consequence.  Thus far,  I  do  not  consider
    there has been any inconsistency on the part of the Secretary of State.
      The  Secretary  of  State  has  acted   consistently   towards   both
    entrepreneurial  team  members,  in  that  she  rejected   both   their
    applications on  the  grounds  that  they  had  not  provided  all  the
    specified documents.  So the fact that Mr Islam was successful  in  his
    appeal against the refusal  decision  directed  against  him  does  not
    establish retrospectively that the refusal  decision  directed  towards
    the appellant was unlawful  as  being  contrary  to  the  principle  of
    consistency.  The inconsistency of outcome comes about because  of  the
    differing fortunes of the appellant and  Mr  Islam  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  I have earlier explained in this determination  why  I  have
    come to a different conclusion from that of Judge Andonian.

86. However, the fact that the Secretary of State has gone on to  grant  Mr
    Islam leave to remain fortifies the appellant's position with regard to
    a fresh application for leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1  Entrepreneur
    Migrant.  The findings of Judge Andonian as to the  genuine  nature  of
    the business stand unchallenged. Indeed, they were not put in issue  in
    either  refusal  letter.   The  appellant  is  not  facing  a   removal
    direction, and it is open to him to make a fresh application for  leave
    to remain within 28 days of  his  appeal  rights  being  deemed  to  be
    exhausted, without becoming an overstayer.  As this avenue is  open  to
    the appellant, I do not consider that the consequences of  the  refusal
    decision have such gravity as to engage Article 8(1) ECHR.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal
contained an error of law, and accordingly the decision  is  set  aside  and
the following decision is substituted: the appellant's  appeal  against  the
refusal of further leave to remain  is  dismissed  on  all  grounds  raised.
