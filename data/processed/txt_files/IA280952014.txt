For the Appellant:     Mr David Shaw (Solicitor)
For the Respondent:    Mr C Kandola (HOPO)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Boylan Kemp, promulgated on 3rd June 2015, following a hearing at
    Birmingham Sheldon Court on 5th May 2015.  In  the  determination,  the
    judge allowed the appeal of Mrs Rajeswary Thiagarajah.  The  Respondent
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka, who was born on 27th  February
    1939.  She is 76 years of age.  She appealed against  the  decision  of
    the Respondent Secretary of State dated 3rd  July  2014,  refusing  her
    application for leave to remain in the UK on human rights grounds.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that she has lived in Sri Lanka for her entire
    life.  She had three sons born between 1962 and 1969.  Her husband died
    in 1982.  She has no other family  members  left  in  Sri  Lanka.   The
    Appellant was visiting her UK based son, who is her Sponsor,  when  her
    eldest son moved to Australia, and with whom the Appellant had lived in
    Sri Lanka prior to his emigrating to Australia.  She left in  May  2013
    to visit her son in Canada before travelling to the UK on 11th November
    2013.  Her health has significantly deteriorated since she has been  in
    the UK.  She is unable to care for herself if returned  to  Sri  Lanka.
    There is insufficient care available for her in Sri  Lanka.   Moreover,
    she is not  able  to  financially,  physically,  and  emotionally  have
    anybody else support her.  She cannot be cared for  by  her  two  other
    sons, one of whom is in Australia and the other is in North America.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge held that the Appellant could  not  succeed  under  paragraph
    276ADE(1) and could not satisfy the dependent adult relative Rule under
    EC-DR.1.1(a) which requires the applicant to be outside the UK  at  the
    time of the application, which she plainly was not in this  case.   The
    Appellant's  appeal  would  fail  under  the  Immigration  Rules   (see
    paragraph 27).

 5. The judge went on to consider the submission made  on  the  Appellant's
    behalf that she was an elderly woman now who would find having to go to
    a foreign country frightening, and that she is dependent on her  family
    due to her age and health (see paragraph 31).

 6. The judge concluded that the Appellant had a family and private life in
    the UK.  In the circumstances, requiring her to return  permanently  to
    Sri Lanka would be an interference of such gravity as to engage Article
    8 (see paragraph 34).  The judge went on to  find  that  the  Appellant
    "has developed a strong bond with her grandchildren and that she  would
    be greatly upset if she had to leave them, and that she would be unable
    to cope on her own if she were to go back  to  Sri  Lanka  and  she  is
    dependent on her family in the UK" (paragraph 35).

 7. Furthermore, the judge observed how the Appellant  had  given  evidence
    that, "she would not be able to obtain a carer to help her in Sri Lanka
    as there are none available and that  there  is  no  professional  body
    providing carers" (paragraph 36).  Furthermore, the Sponsor's statement
    also echoed this concern, "as to the Appellant's ability  to  care  for
    herself on a daily basis due to age and health" (paragraph 37).   There
    were also medical letters from practitioners (paragraph 38).

 8. Taking the medical evidence into account and noting that "the Appellant
    has age and health related conditions that means she  is  reliant  upon
    her family to perform everyday tasks such as cooking and shopping", the
    judge concluded that, "there is a level of dependency that goes  beyond
    the normal family ties and so the principles set out in Kugathas [2003]
    INLR 170 apply" (paragraph 43).

 9. On this basis, the judge allowed the appeal on human rights grounds.

Grounds of Application

10. The grounds of application state that the judge was wrong to allow  the
    appeal on Article 8 grounds because the judge had observed already that
    the Appellant had lived "the vast majority" of her life  in  Sri  Lanka
    (see paragraph 44), and the Sponsor could arrange for a carer  for  her
    in Sri Lanka (see paragraph 42), and her presence in this  country  had
    been wholly precarious  such  that  there  was  a  public  interest  in
    maintaining effective immigration controls.

11. On 11th August 2015, permission to appeal was granted on the basis that
    the judge had made only a superficial reference to public  interest  in
    paragraph 33 of the decision and allowing the appeal  on  human  rights
    grounds had not been properly justified.

Submissions

12. At the hearing before me on 6th November 2015, Mr Kandola, appearing on
    behalf  of  the  Respondent  Secretary  of  State,  submitted  that  at
    paragraph 24 the judge had noted that  this  was  an  application  that
    could not succeed under the Rules because the Appellant was required to
    be outside  the  UK  in  order  to  make  a  dependent  adult  relative
    application.  At paragraph 27 the judge had observed that, "it would be
    proportionate to require the Appellant to return to Sri Lanka so as  to
    make her application to return as an adult  dependent  relative"  under
    the Immigration Rules (see paragraph 27).  That, submitted Mr  Kandola,
    was nub of the appeal.  The judge had considered both  the  Immigration
    Rule requirement as  well  as  the  proportionality  of  requiring  the
    Appellant to return and to make  a  fresh  application  from  overseas.
    There is noting further to be  said.   Consideration  of  the  doctor's
    letters (see page 131) suggesting that the Appellant suffered from type
    2 diabetes, and had the early onset of dementia and  high  cholesterol,
    were not the kind of medical problems that could not be catered for  in
    Sri Lanka, and an appeal could not have  been  allowed  on  exceptional
    grounds on this basis.

13.  For  his  part,  Mr  Shaw  submitted  that  he  would  rely  upon  the
    "Appellant's response  to  the  Respondent's  Notice  of  Appeal".   He
    submitted that the judge had  considered  every  one  of  the  elements
    applicable in  this  appeal.   Having  done  so,  the  judge  said  (at
    paragraph 33) that the Razgar Rules had to be applied before the appeal
    could be allowed under Article 8.  He gave proper consideration then to
    the "public  interest"  requirement.   He  then  went  on  to  say  (at
    paragraph  34)  that  the  main  issue  was   whether   it   would   be
    proportionate, as a matter of human rights law, to  allow  the  appeal.
    He then considered (at paragraph 35) the fact that there was a  "strong
    bond with her grandchildren and that she would be greatly upset if  she
    had to leave them".  At paragraph 42, the  judge  recognised  that  the
    Sponsor had said in cross-examination that he could arrange for a carer
    for the Appellant in Sri Lanka, "but he did not know if they would look
    after her in the same way  as  her  children  would,  and  that  he  is
    concerned they would simply do the day-to-day chores and not deal  with
    the fact that she was emotionally down" (paragraph  42).   It  was  not
    enough to say that carers were available in Sri Lanka.

14. The main question was how  this  would  affect  the  Appellant  in  her
    present circumstances when she already knew that  she  could  be  well-
    cared for by her own relatives and children in the UK.   This  was  the
    aspect that the judge had specifically  considered  himself.   Mr  Shaw
    submitted that the Sponsor and his  wife  were  high  earners,  earning
    �50,000 and �30,000 respectively.  They  could  afford  to  look  after
    their mother without recourse to public funds, and  thereby  minimising
    the public interest in the enforcement of immigration  control  against
    her.  They had a five bedroom house.

15. The Sponsor was vulnerable and showed clinical signs of early  dementia
    that were of concern to the entire  family.   As  far  as  the  judge's
    reference to it being "proportionate to require the Appellant to return
    to Sri Lanka so as to make  her  application  to  return  as  an  adult
    dependent relative" (see paragraph 27) is concerned, what  this  refers
    to plainly is that this was not a "Chikamba-style" type case,  so  that
    the Immigration Rules plainly had to be adhered to.  This is made quite
    clear  in  the  paragraph  where  the  judge   refers   to   it   being
    "proportionate".  Thereafter, however, the judge goes  on  to  consider
    the human  rights  aspect  of  the  case  quite  independently  of  the
    Immigration Rules, and it is at this stage  that  he  states  that  the
    remaining question is  "whether  or  not  such  interference  would  be
    proportionate" (see paragraph 34).

16. At this stage the judge then begins to look at the human rights aspects
    of  the  case,  drawing  attention  to  the  "strong  bond   with   her
    grandchildren" and how the Appellant states in her  witness  statement,
    that, "as a lone elderly woman I would be vulnerable.  Age is  catching
    up with me and I am hard of hearing.  I find it difficult to  move  and
    would have trouble shopping and cooking".

17. These matters the judge was entitled  to  look  at  as  a  question  of
    "proportionality" in the context of human rights law.  Having done  so,
    the judge was of the view that the appeal should be  allowed  on  human
    rights grounds.  To say so was not to fall into error.

18. In reply, Mr Kandola submitted that the  Appellant  did  not  meet  the
    Immigration Rules and the proper course of action was for her to return
    and to make a fresh application under the Immigration Rules.

No Error of Law

19. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.  My  reasons  are
    as follows.  The judge here found that the Appellant had a private  and
    family life (see paragraph 34) which went beyond  normal  family  ties.
    He took into account the  Appellant's  age,  her  health,  and  related
    conditions and that she is reliant upon  her  family  to  perform  such
    everyday tasks as cooking and shopping  (paragraph  43).   He  observed
    that the Sponsor was financially  independent  and  had  undertaken  to
    provide for the Appellant (paragraph 44).  There  was  also  sufficient
    accommodation.  The judge had particular regard to the medical evidence
    (at paragraph 43).

20. He took into account the public interest.  He  was  quite  specific  in
    stating that, ".... I must take into account the public interest in the
    maintenance of effective immigration control, as  set  out  in  Section
    117B ..." (paragraph 33).  It is not as if this  was  overlooked.   The
    matter was considered comprehensively and the balance of considerations
    plainly fell in favour of the Appellant, and the judge expounded  upon,
    as he was entitled to do.

21. In Budhathoki (reasons for decisions) [2014] UKUT  341,  Haddon-Cave  J
    confirmed that, "it is generally unnecessary and unhelpful  for  First-
    tier Tribunal judgements to rehearse every detail  raised  in  a  case,
    provided that judges .... identify and resolve  key  conflicts  in  the
    evidence and explain in clear and brief terms that  their  reasons,  so
    that the parties can understand why they have won or  lost".   This  is
    plainly the case here.

22. It confirms the earlier position set out  in  Shizad  [2013]  UKUT  85,
    where the Tribunal stated that the "reasons it did not make sense is if
    the decision as a whole makes sense".   This  is  manifestly  the  case
    here.  The challenge in this case amounts to a  disagreement  with  the
    judge's findings.  There is no error of law.  The judge is entitled, on
    the evidence, to come to the conclusions that he did.

Decision

The decision of the original judge did not amount to an error of  law.   The
decision stands.  The appeal of the Secretary of State is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
