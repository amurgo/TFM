                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Before us the appellant was  represented  by  Mr  R  Budworth  of  Counsel
instructed by  Tolulope  A  Laleya,  Solicitors  and  the  respondent  was
represented by Miss C Hanrahan, a Home Office Presenting Officer.

The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria.  He was born on 30 January 1979 and
so  is  now  almost  25  years  old.    He  appeals  the  decision  of  an
Adjudicator, Mr James R Devittie, who in a determination promulgated on 12
May 2003 dismissed his appeal against a decision of  the  Entry  Clearance
Officer that he was not entitled to enter the United Kingdom as a visitor.

At paragraph 5 of the determination the Adjudicator says: "In  considering
this appeal I shall bear in mind that it is for the appellant to show that
on a balance  of  probabilities,  the  decision  of  the  ECO  is  not  in
accordance with the law and the immigration rules."

Whilst this does reflect the language of paragraph 21 of Schedule 4 of the
Immigration and Asylum Act 1999,  it  is  a  phrase  that  gives  us  some
concern. It is clear from the Act, and is long settled law, that,  subject
to the need to show respect for, which does not mean necessarily coming to
the same conclusion as, the opinions of people who have heard  a  claimant
or other witness, the adjudicator must decide the case for himself on  the
material before him. (We note in parentheses that there is a very  helpful
passage in  Macdonald  &  Webber  5th  edition  at  18.78  explaining  the
adjudicator's powers when "reviewing questions of fact")

In paragraph 6  the  Adjudicator  says:  "I  am  satisfied  that  the  ECO
correctly found that he was not satisfied that the appellant  was  seeking
entry genuinely for the purpose stated and that he would return at the end
of his visit." The issue before the Adjudicator is not whether or  not  he
agrees with the Entry Clearance Officer  but  whether  the  appellant  has
satisfied the Adjudicator that he is  entitled  to  entry  to  the  United
Kingdom.    Adjudicators  do  not  review  decisions  of  Entry  Clearance
Officers.   It is the Adjudicator's duty to make up his own  mind  on  the
evidence before him.

It is also concerns us that the Adjudicator does not mention the  relevant
immigration rule in the determination.  He was being required to  consider
paragraph 41 of HC 395.    The Entry Clearance Officer did not make it  as
clear as he should have done but it is apparent that the  Entry  Clearance
Officer was not satisfied that the appellant "is genuinely  seeking  entry
as a visitor for the limited period as stated  by  him,  not  exceeding  6
months: and intends to leave the United Kingdom at the end of  the  period
of the visit as stated by him:"  These are the requirements  of  paragraph
41(i) and (ii) of HC 395. Almost certainly the Adjudicator had this  fully
in the front of his mind but it would have been better if he had stated it
unequivocally at the start of the determination.

The grounds of appeal criticise the Adjudicator for  not  considering  the
appellant's case but for simply setting out the  substance  of  the  Entry
Clearance Officer's reasons for refusing the application and  the  grounds
of appeal.   That criticism is justified.   This  determination  does  not
show any analysis of the relevant evidence.

At paragraph 6 of  the  determination  the  Adjudicator,  having  accepted
positive aspects of the appellant's case, says "I  am  unable  however  to
find fault with the reasoning that the appellant as a young single man has
not demonstrated sufficiently strong ties with Nigeria".   The Adjudicator
did not have to find fault with that reasoning.  It is not  a  requirement
of the rules that the appellant has strong ties with  Nigeria.   Certainly
it is a fact in the case that can illuminate  other  evidence  but  it  is
irrelevant that the Entry Clearance  Officer  thought  this  an  important
point unless he persuades the adjudicator that it is by relevant argument.
What the Adjudicator should have been doing  was  asking  himself  if  the
evidence persuaded him that the appellant satisfied  the  requirements  of
the rules.

In his Form IM2A dated 28 August 2002 the appellant said that he wanted to
visit the United Kingdom for a period of 4 weeks for a family visit.

The Entry Clearance Officer accepted that the appellant  had  two  sisters
and a brother living in the United Kingdom and that one sister  had  lived
there since 1993.   The Entry Clearance Officer found that  the  appellant
was unable to provide a satisfactory explanation as to why  he  wanted  to
visit her after all this time and went on to find that lack of explanation
led him to doubt the appellant's  intentions.    The  appellant  indicated
that he intended to do his service with the National  Youth  Corp  and  to
complete his studies and then work in  the  family  business.   The  Entry
Clearance Officer found that the  appellant  had  not  shown  sufficiently
strong family, social and economic ties in Nigeria  to  conclude  that  he
intended to return.   The Entry Clearance Officer also found the financial
outlay on the proposed trip to  be  disproportionate  to  the  appellant's
circumstances.  It is not  particularly  clear  how  the  Entry  Clearance
Officer came to the conclusions that he did.    The  Adjudicator  was  not
impressed with them.   The Adjudicator found expressly that there  was  no
justification for the Entry Clearance Officer's opinion that the appellant
could not provide any reason why he wanted to visit  his  sister  and  the
Adjudicator expressly accepted that the appellant's mother had  sufficient
funds to make available to the appellant for his visit.

With respect  to  the  Adjudicator  there  is  simply  no  basis  for  the
Adjudicator's conclusion that the appellant did not intend  to  return  to
Nigeria at the end of his visit.  Indeed, more correctly, the  Adjudicator
did not reach this conclusion.  What  the  Adjudicator  did  was  to  find
himself unable to disagree with the Entry Clearance  Officer  in  reaching
that conclusion.  This illustrates clearly how the Adjudicator misdirected
himself.   There is no proper basis for the conclusion that the  appellant
does not intend to return to Nigeria at the end of the proposed  visit  or
that the appellant was not genuinely seeking entry as a  visitor  for  the
limited period as stated by him.

We do not know what is in this appellant's mind.  However,  we  are  quite
satisfied that  the  evidence  before  the  Adjudicator,  and  indeed  the
Adjudicator's findings of fact, when applied properly to the rules  should
have led him to the conclusion that the appeal ought to be allowed.

We allow this appeal.
