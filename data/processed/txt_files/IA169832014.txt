Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Bramble
For the Respondent:    Ms Sharkey

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Mr Govindarajan is a citizen of India born in 1976.  On 25 March 2014 a
    decision was made by the Secretary of State to refuse to vary his leave
    to remain as a Tier 1  (General)  Migrant  and  to  remove  by  way  of
    directions.  His application was made on 21 January 2014.

 2. He appealed.

 3. Although in proceedings before me the Appellant  is  the  Secretary  of
    State, for convenience I retain the designations as  they  were  before
    the First-tier Tribunal, thus, Mr Govindarajan is the Appellant and the
    Secretary of State, the Respondent.

 4. The Respondent's  decision  was  made  under  paragraph  245CA  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  Specifically, the Respondent was not satisfied that
    the Appellant met the  requirements  to  be  awarded  75  points  under
    Appendix A (245CA(b)).  In that regard the  Appellant  had  claimed  40
    points for earnings in the range of �35,000 to  �39,999  (�22,862  from
    his employment and  �13,175  from  self-employment).   The  figure  for
    employment was not in dispute.  However, the Respondent did not  accept
    the self-employment earnings.  Accordingly, the Respondent  awarded  15
    points for previous earnings in the range �20,000 to �22,999.

 5. It was stated in the decision letter that the  Respondent  had  applied
    the Genuine Earnings Test to the application as outlined  in  paragraph
    19(i) in Appendix  A.   The  Respondent  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    earnings which the  Appellant  had  claimed  from  his  self-employment
    trading in the UK were from genuine  self-employment.   The  Respondent
    had considered all nine points of the Genuine Earnings Test, but it was
    stated that she only had concerns  with  the  following:  the  evidence
    which the Appellant had submitted; whether  the  earnings  claimed  had
    been earned through genuine employment,  rather  than  being  borrowed,
    gifted, or otherwise shown in the  financial  transactions  or  records
    without being earned; whether the business from which the earnings were
    claimed can be shown to exist and be lawfully and genuinely trading.

 6. Further, the Respondent expressed concerns in the decision  in  respect
    of the legitimacy of the earnings claimed as income from  his  business
    trading as 'M Power'.  It was stated that during his interview  he  was
    asked about how he  was  paid  and  the  payment  period  he  gave  his
    customers, but that he failed to specify how  these  arrangements  were
    made.  He did not specify the agents he referred to in his interview or
    the reasons for delays  in  payment.   The  Respondent  was  unable  to
    determine the payment process for his trading and  considered  that  he
    had failed to detail the involvement of these agencies.

 7. The Respondent was also concerned with the business relationship he had
    with his accountant.

 8. Following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 25 November 2014  Judge  of  the
    First tier Sieffert allowed the appeal.

 9. The judge, from paragraph 14ff of the determination, narrates in detail
    the documents submitted by the Appellant with his application.  At [31]-
    [32] she notes that he  sought  at  the  hearing  to  lodge  additional
    documents.  This was opposed by the Presenting  Officer  because,  this
    being a Points Based case, only documents which had  been  provided  at
    the time of the application could be considered.

10.  However,  the  judge  admitted  them   as   evidence   accepting   the
    representative's  submission  that  comments  in  the  refusal   letter
    amounted to an allegation of deception.

11. The judge's conclusions are  at  [37]-[40].   She  found  that  'having
    considered the evidence as  a  whole'  the  Appellant  was  a  credible
    witness [37].

12. She went on (at [38]): "(He) submitted documents with  his  application
    form which were included in  the  Appellant's  bundle.   This  included
    business bank statements showing payments from each of his  clients,  a
    letter from his accountant identifying and confirming the  sums  earned
    from his self-employment together with other documents.   (He)  made  a
    number of criticisms of the interview process which are referred to  in
    his witness statement and additional oral evidence at the hearing.  The
    interviewer  was  not  satisfied  with  his  answers  and  doubted  the
    reliability of his claim to income from self-employment.   (He)  sought
    to clarify the position in a letter following the interview.   However,
    his application was refused. ... He has  produced  further  documentary
    evidence to rebut the Respondent's rejection of his  application  which
    Ms Sharkey submitted amounted to a 'veiled allegation of deception'".

13. She concluded (at [39]): "I have carefully considered the documents and
    evidence overall.  There  is  nothing  to  suggest  that  the  firm  of
    accountants have not acted properly and professionally  throughout.   I
    am satisfied that (he) has explained the mechanics of how the  business
    is run and that this is a genuine business which generated  the  income
    claimed".

14. The Respondent sought permission to appeal which was granted.

15. At the error of law hearing Mr Bramble sought to  rely  on  the  single
    ground, namely, that the judge erred in permitting  the  production  of
    post application documents.  It was speculation  on  the  part  of  the
    representative that there was a veiled allegation of deception.   There
    was no evidence to support that assertion.  Had the  Respondent  wished
    to assert deception she would have done so under the Rules.

16. Ms Sharkey's position before me was essentially the same as it had been
    before the First-tier Tribunal.  There  was  clear  indication  in  the
    Respondent's reasons for refusal  that  she  considered  the  documents
    lodged with the application to be fraudulent.

17. In considering this matter the  sole  issue  is  the  admissibility  of
    evidence.  Section 85 of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 reads:

         "...

         (4)  On an appeal under Section 82(1) ... against  a  decision  the
             Tribunal may consider  evidence  about  any  matter  which  it
             thinks relevant to the substance of  the  decision,  including
             evidence which concerns a matter arising after the date of the
             decision.

         (5)  But sub-section (4) is subject to the  exceptions  in  section
             85A.

         Section 85(A) states:

         ...

         (3)  Exception 2 applies to an appeal under section 82(1) if

             (a)  the appeal is against an immigration decision of  a  kind
                  specified in section 82(2)(a) or (d);

             (b)  the immigration decision concerned an  application  of  a
                  kind identified in immigration rules as  requiring  to  be
                  considered under a 'Points Based System';

             ...

         (4)  Where Exception 2 applies the Tribunal may  consider  evidence
             adduced by the Appellant only if it -

             (a)  was submitted in support of, and at the time  of  making,
                  the application to which the immigration decision related;



             ...

             (c)  is adduced to prove that a document is genuine or valid."

18. The First-tier Judge noted (at [20]) the  following  from  the  refusal
    letter:

         "When you were asked why you chose your accountant you  replied  'I
         have known them for about 3 years.  I have sought  business  advice
         from them'.  You failed to elaborate on the nature of the  business
         advice you received from your accountant during the  interview  and
         there are questions surrounding his involvement in your application
         and whether the documents supplied may not  have  been  created  by
         yourself."

19. I do not find merit in the submission that had the Respondent wished to
    allege dishonesty she would have  done  so  under  the  Rules.   In  my
    judgment the words "... there are questions surrounding  (accountant's)
    involvement in your application and whether the documents supplied  may
    not have been created by yourself" are clear in meaning.  The judge was
    entitled to  treat  them  as  amounting  to  a  "veiled  allegation  of
    dishonesty". Indeed, they are scarcely even "veiled". They are overt in
    respect of the documents submitted with the application.  As  such  the
    judge was entitled to find that the documents submitted at the hearing,
    and which she found directly relevant as  rebuttal  to  the  allegation
    that the earlier documents submitted were not "genuine or valid",  were
    admissible under section 85A(3)(c).

20. It is not submitted that having admitted the later documentary evidence
    she was not entitled to reach, for the reasons she gave, her conclusion
    that the income from  self-employment  was  as  claimed  and  that  the
    Appellant was entitled to  the  points  claimed  and  that  he  thereby
    satisfied the Rule.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shows no material error of  law  and
that decision allowing the appeal shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
