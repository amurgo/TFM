                                   Before

                        UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE MOULDEN

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


    Representation:

                            For the Appellant: the appellant appeared
           in person and was not represented
          For the Respondent: Mr P Nath a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica who  was  born  on  29  November
      1978. On 12 January 2009  the  respondent  made  a  deportation  order
      against him by virtue of section 32 (5) of the UK Borders Act 2007. At
      various times their positions have been transposed, each  has  changed
      from being the appellant to the respondent and  vice  versa.  In  this
      determination and in the hope of achieving consistency and  clarity  I
      will refer to the claimant as the appellant and the Secretary of State
      as the respondent.


   2. The appellant appealed against the deportation order  and  his  appeal
      was heard in the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal by a panel consisting
      of an Immigration Judge and a non-legal member on 28 April 2009.  Both
      parties were represented. The appellant's  appeal  was  dismissed.  He
      applied for and obtained an order for reconsideration.  On  12  August
      2009 a Senior Immigration Judge found that the panel had erred in  law
      by misunderstanding important aspects of the evidence as to  when  the
      appellant and his partner (later  his  wife)  had  lived  together.  A
      rehearing was ordered.


   3. The appeal was re-heard in  the  Asylum  and  Appeal  Tribunal  by  an
      Immigration Judge on 5 October 2009.  Once  again  both  parties  were
      represented. By this stage it was clear  that  the  appeal  was  being
      pursued on Article 8 human rights grounds only. The judge allowed  the
      appellant's appeal.


   4. The respondent sought permission to appeal  to  the  Court  of  Appeal
      which was granted by a Senior Immigration Judge. On 24 June  2010  the
      Court of Appeal heard the appeal. By this stage the appellant was  not
      legally represented. Counsel appeared for the respondent. The Court of
      Appeal allowed the appeal, quashed the  decision  of  the  Immigration
      Judge dated 15 October 2009 (which followed the hearing on  5  October
      2009) and directed that "the matter be remitted for reconsideration in
      its entirety to the Upper Tribunal".


   5. The rehearing has been listed before the Upper Tribunal on a number of
      occasions, as far as I can see on 25 June  2012,  20  March  2013,  16
      April 2013 and today. The appellant  does  not  appear  to  have  been
      legally represented since sometime before the Court of Appeal hearing.
      Various directions have been given in an attempt to  ensure  that  all
      the necessary documents and witness statements  were  put  before  the
      Tribunal, preferably in advance of the  hearing  and  giving  everyone
      time to consider them. Except to a very limited extent  the  appellant
      has not complied with these directions.


   6. The first occasion on which the appellant appeared before  me  was  16
      April 2013. He told me  that  he  had  been  trying  to  obtain  legal
      representation, so far without success, but he has an appointment with
      a solicitor later that week which he hoped would lead to his obtaining
      legal help. He had not  been  able  to  afford  the  sums  which  some
      solicitors had asked for.  He  told  me  that  he  was  not  currently
      working. His funds were very limited and he hoped to be able to obtain
      legal aid. He accepted that he had received the notices of hearing and
      the  various  directions.  He  asked  for  an  adjournment  which  the
      Presenting Officer opposed. I granted  the  adjournment  to  give  the
      appellant  another  and  probably  last   chance   to   obtain   legal
      representation. I explained to him what he needed to do  in  order  to
      comply with  the  directions,  the  importance  of  supplying  witness
      statements and documents and that he should bring all his witnesses to
      the adjourned hearing. I indicated that he would be unlikely to obtain
      another adjournment.


   7. At today's hearing the appellant told me that he had not been able  to
      afford the fee sought by the solicitor he had been to see and had  not
      been able to obtain legal aid. He brought with him Mrs X  who  is  his
      mother-in-law, Ms Y who is the mother of his son A,  A  aged  12,  his
      daughter B aged 18 and his daughter C aged 11. He said that  his  wife
      could not attend because she was unwell; suffering from a stomach  bug
      and his son D wished to attend but could not  do  so  because  he  was
      taking a Maths exam. He indicated that he wished  to  call  all  those
      present to give evidence. He produced letters from A, B, C and  Ms  Y.
      There was no letter or statement from his wife.


   8. Mr Nath indicated that he would not wish to cross  examine  any  child
      witness. Ms Y, A's mother, expressed a strong preference that her  son
      should not  give  evidence  or  remain  in  the  hearing  room.  After
      discussion as to whether it was appropriate for  younger  children  to
      give evidence or to remain in the hearing room  the  appellant  agreed
      that the best course of action would be  for  A  and  C  not  to  give
      evidence or to remain in the hearing  room.  B,  aged  18  would  give
      evidence.


   9. I went through the documents on the Tribunal file with the  appellant.
      It appears that he has everything in the respondent's bundle.  I  told
      him that there was on the Tribunal  file  a  bundle  prepared  by  his
      former solicitors running to 63 pages which was put before  the  panel
      for the first hearing. I showed it to him and he agreed that this  was
      the case. Mr Nath did not have this bundle so copies  were  taken  for
      him and I gave him time to read them. The appellant thought that there
      had been a further bundle produced by his solicitors for a  subsequent
      hearing, probably the hearing on October 2009. These are  not  on  the
      Tribunal file. The appellant  could  not  remember  what  this  bundle
      contained or whether there was anything important on which  he  wanted
      to rely. I told him that he and his witnesses could give  evidence  in
      relation to matters both before and after what  was  set  out  in  the
      witness statements annexed to the bundle before me. Copies of the case
      law to which reference was made were given to the appellant.


  10. I explained the hearing procedure to the appellant and to each witness
      what was required of him or her. I told the appellant that I would  do
      my best to assist him within the limits of fairness to both sides.  It
      was clear that the appellant did not know how to order his evidence or
      ask questions of his witnesses. If I had left him to  attempt  this  I
      considered that only limited coherent evidence would have emerged  and
      important issues would not have been addressed. In  the  circumstances
      and without objection from Mr Nath  I  took  the  appellant  and  each
      witness through his or her evidence taking as my starting  point  such
      witness statements, letters and other information as I have.  I  asked
      the appellant and  the  other  witnesses  whether  they  wish  to  add
      anything. Mr Nath cross-examined the witnesses apart from B.








  11. I heard oral evidence from the appellant, Ms Y, Mrs  X  and  B.  Their
      evidence is set out in my record of proceedings.


  12. Mr Nath relied on the reasons for refusal letter of  19  January  2009
      and  the  judge's  sentencing  remarks.  He  argued  that  there  were
      uncertainties and inconsistencies as  to  the  periods  of  separation
      between the appellant and his wife. For one period he  said  2005  and
      she said 2006, although later he said that she was right. There was no
      documentary evidence to show the addresses at which the appellant  had
      lived  or  for  what  periods.  There  was  no  documentary   evidence
      confirming his claimed periods of employment.


  13. Mr Nath submitted that the appellant's conviction in 2007  was  for  a
      very serious class A drugs offence. Since then he had  been  convicted
      of drink-driving. Before the 2007 offence there were three convictions
      for possession of cannabis, one caution  and  another  conviction  for
      driving without insurance. The OASYS  report  appeared  to  have  been
      produced in 2007 and put him at medium to  low  risk  of  reoffending.
      There was no subsequent report.


  14. In relation to the Article 8 grounds and his  family  situation  there
      was little evidence about  his  children's  progress  in  life  or  at
      school. At this point the appellant said that he had a letter from C's
      head teacher dated 6 June 2013 which he  produced.  Mr  Nath  did  not
      object and I accepted this in evidence. Mr Nath argued that  it  would
      have been helpful to have evidence from the  appellant's  wife.  There
      was no medical evidence to show that she was not  fit  to  attend  the
      hearing.


  15. Mr Nath accepted that this was a case decided before 9 July  2012.  He
      relied on Ogundimu (Article 8 - new  rules)  Nigeria  [2013]  UKUT  60
      (IAC), MF (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT 00393 (IAC)  and
      Green (Article 8 - new rules) [2013] UKUT 00254  (IAC).  He  submitted
      that I should consider the appeal under the new rules but  might  then
      find it necessary to go on and consider the appeal under the Article 8
      jurisprudence outside the new rules.  He  argued  that  the  appellant
      failed under the new rules because he had not been in this country for
      20 years. I should look at the competing interests of  the  public  on
      the one hand and the appellant his wife and children on the other.  He
      had shown a total disregard the laws of the UK. Mr Nath accepted  that
      the appellant had established private life here but he  had  committed
      very serious offences. I was asked to dismiss the appeal.


  16. The appellant said that on release from prison he was on probation and
      had no difficulties with his probation officer. If he had been in  any
      trouble he would have been sent back to prison.  In  relation  to  the
      drink-driving offence he argued said that he  was  not  far  over  the
      limit and had not realised that this was the case. He was  finding  it
      difficult to get work because he needed to show his passport which was
      held by the Home Office. He said that at some earlier stage  the  Home
      Office had told him that they would not be  pursuing  the  deportation
      order. He was not able to tell me who had said this or when. He agreed
      that it had not been put in writing. He said that he had been  refused
      naturalisation only because he had not provided his  driving  licence.
      He had a provisional driving licence but accepted that he had not sent
      it to the respondent because it was with the DVLA for endorsement.  He
      asked me to allow his appeal. I reserved my determination.


  17. The decision of the original panel was found to be flawed  and  a  "de
      novo" hearing was ordered. The subsequent decision of the  Immigration
      Judge was quashed by the Court of  Appeal.  In  the  circumstances  no
      findings of credibility or fact are preserved from either decision and
      I  cannot  treat  them  as  my  starting  point  applying   Devaseelan
      principles. However I can,  with  caution,  look  at  the  records  of
      evidence given  on  those  occasions  as  they  are  set  out  in  the
      determinations.  This  is  necessary  and  helpful  because   of   the
      limitations in the  evidence  submitted  to  me  by  an  unrepresented
      appellant. In 2009 the appellant  was  represented  and  the  evidence
      given then helps establish the position at that time.


  18. Looking at the evidence in the round I make  the  following  findings.
      The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica who arrived  in  the  UK  on  17
      October 1999 as a visitor. He was 20 years of age. He was granted  one
      month's leave but overstayed. On 5 January 2000 he applied  for  leave
      to stay as a student on a computer course. He attended the college for
      less than half of the possible sessions. His application  was  refused
      on 20 November 2000. In March 2000 he started living with  Z.  I  will
      refer to her as his wife although they did not marry until later.


  19. On 20 April 2001 the appellant was served with papers as an overstayer
      and his removal to Jamaica was set for 21 April 2001.  However  before
      he could be removed his representatives made an application for asylum
      on his behalf claiming that he had a well founded fear of  persecution
      in Jamaica.


  20. On 10  September  2001  the  appellant  made  an  application  for  an
      extension of stay as the spouse of  his  wife.  It  appears  that  the
      asylum claim was dropped. On 29 March 2003 the appellant  was  granted
      leave to remain in the UK until 29 March 2004  on  the  basis  of  his
      marriage. On 16 March 2004 he was granted indefinite leave  to  remain
      in the UK. On 26 October 2005 he applied for  naturalisation  but  was
      unable to provide his driving licence. On 23 May 2006 his  application
      for naturalisation was refused.


  21. On 26 April 2001 the appellant was cautioned for the possession  of  a
      class B drug, cannabis. On 25  July  2001  at  Greenwich  Magistrate's
      Court the appellant was  convicted  of  possessing  a  class  B  drug,
      cannabis, on 20 July 2001. He was fined �40 and costs. On 13 May  2003
      at Wycombe and Beaconsfield Magistrate's Court  he  was  convicted  of
      possessing a class B drug, cannabis, on 7 May 2003. He was  fined  �80
      and costs. On 16 June 2003, at the  same  Magistrate's  Court  he  was
      convicted of possessing a class B drug, cannabis, on 9 June  2003  and
      given a conditional discharge for 12 months. On 16  November  2007  at
      Snaresbrook Crown Court, having pleaded not guilty, he  was  convicted
      of possessing a class A controlled drug, cocaine, on 8 September 2006.
      He was sentenced to 40 months imprisonment. He was sent to  prison  on
      16 November 2007 and released on  28  July  2009.  In  his  sentencing
      remarks the judge emphasised the seriousness of drug  dealing.  Whilst
      the evidence did not seem to indicate that the appellant was "near  to
      the top of the network of drug dealing" the  real  circumstances  were
      not clear because his case was that he knew nothing about  the  drugs.
      The panel who heard the appellant's appeal in 2009 recorded that there
      was no probation, OASYS or other report before them dealing  with  the
      risk of reoffending. There is no such evidence before me.


  22.  I cannot find any documentary evidence that the  appellant  has  also
      been convicted for driving without insurance although he accepts  that
      he was convicted in 2001 and points were put on his  licence.  In  his
      evidence before me the appellant admitted that since his release  from
      prison he has been convicted of drink-driving in February 2012. He was
      disqualified from driving  for  nine  months,  ordered  to  attend  an
      awareness course and the fine and costs totalled approximately �385.


  23. There are five children with whom  the  appellant  claims  to  have  a
      fatherly relationship. B who was born in 1994 is the daughter  of  his
      wife by a previous relationship. He is not  her  natural  father.  She
      lives with the appellant and his wife. C who was born in 2002  is  the
      daughter of the appellant and his wife. She lives with  the  appellant
      and his wife. A was born in 2001 and is the son of the  appellant  and
      Ms Y. He lives with his mother. D was born in 1997. He is the  son  of
      the appellant and Q and lives with his mother in the UK. E was born in
      1995. He is the son of the appellant and R. He lives in Jamaica.


  24. I find that the appellant has done some work in the UK, mainly in  the
      building trade. He claimed that since his release from prison in  July
      2009 he had worked approximately 85% of the time. On the other hand he
      said that he was  finding  it  very  difficult  to  obtain  employment
      because he did not have his passport and needed to produce  this  when
      applying for a job. Whilst he gave a number which he said was his  tax
      reference number and said that he was working through  an  agency  and
      had started work the day before the hearing he produced no documentary
      evidence to show  any  post-release  employment.  I  accept  that  the
      appellant has done some work in the UK but I do not accept that it has
      been for as high a proportion of the time as he  claims.  Without  his
      passport or other acceptable identity verification documentation it is
      probable  that  he  would  have  difficulty  in  obtaining  legitimate
      employment. The appellant accepts that there was a period during which
      he was paid Jobseekers Allowance. He has not produced any  documentary
      evidence  about  this  and  I  find  that  he  has  probably  received
      Jobseekers Allowance for periods since his  release  from  prison.  He
      accepts and I find that his wife is in receipt  of  benefits.  He  has
      produced no evidence to show the extent of these. The appellant is  in
      good health.








  25. I find that the appellant is currently living with his wife, B  and  C
      in a property rented  from  the  local  authority.  The  accommodation
      consists of two bedrooms, bathroom, kitchen, living and dining  rooms.
      He has lived there since March 2000 but with periods of absence.  They
      met in December 1999 and married in 2001. The first period of  absence
      was in 2000 when he left and went to live with Ms Y. Their son  A  was
      born in May 2001. In 2005 or more probably 2006 the appellant and  his
      wife were arguing and going  through  a  very  difficult  period.  The
      appellant rented a room for about six months where he spent some time.
      His evidence is not clear as to how much of the time  he  spent  there
      and how much with his wife. They were separated  between  16  November
      2007 and 28 July 2009 when the appellant was in prison.


  26. The only witness statement I have from the appellant's  wife  is  that
      submitted for the purpose of the panel hearing in 2009. It is unsigned
      and marked as a "Draft Witness Statement". I  accept  that  she  is  a
      British citizen and  that  her  parents  and  siblings  live  in  this
      country. In 2009 she claimed to be working  full-time  as  a  learning
      support assistant. She has not said what she is doing now and there is
      no documentary evidence about any current employment. There is no  up-
      to-date evidence from her as to the state of her relationship with the
      appellant or whether they have lived together at all  times  since  he
      was released from prison. In her 2009 witness statement she  expressed
      strong disapproval because the appellant smoked cannabis and  she  was
      not able to persuade  him  to  stop.  She  confirmed  the  periods  of
      separation to which I have referred and I prefer her evidence that one
      period was in 2006  rather  than  2005.  She  made  it  clear  to  the
      appellant that if he reoffended after release from  prison  she  would
      not allow him back into the lives of their children. I have  not  been
      told her views on his drink-driving conviction. However, she said that
      he was a good father to the children. In 2009 she said  that  she  was
      depressed. At that stage she said  that  she  would  not  be  able  to
      relocate to Jamaica. She had only been there on holiday. The  children
      were settled here; she would not be able to obtain  a  good  education
      for them in Jamaica and she did not think that the country was a  safe
      place to raise her daughters. Some of this evidence  is  confirmed  by
      others and I accept her evidence as to the position and her  views  in
      2009.


  27. I find Ms Y to be a credible witness. She is a British citizen  and  a
      teacher of English as a foreign language to adults. Apart from  A  she
      has two younger children. The appellant is not their father.  A  lives
      with her but most weekends goes to stay with  the  appellant  and  his
      wife. He gets on well with B and C. There is  not  much  communication
      between her and the appellant's wife. She described the  appellant  as
      like a father to A and that A  looks  up  to  and  respects  him.  She
      thought that A would be devastated if the appellant had to  leave  the
      country and she considers him to be a good influence in his life.  The
      appellant gives her money from time to time when he can. A has been in
      touch with the appellant from his birth until now, apart from the time
      when the appellant was in prison.





  28. I find the appellant's mother-in-law to be a credible witness. She  is
      a British citizen. She provided an unsigned and undated draft  witness
      statement in 2009. She also gave evidence before me. She said that she
      was not aware of the appellant having spent any periods apart from her
      daughter since he came out of prison. She saw her  daughter  regularly
      and often stayed with her and the appellant. She  confirmed  that  the
      appellant and her daughter were living with B and C.  A  and  D  often
      came to stay. She regarded the appellant and her  daughter  as  having
      had their ups and downs and quarrels. When asked what was  wrong  with
      her daughter and why she could not attend the  hearing  she  mentioned
      tummy trouble and said that there was always  something  wrong.  Asked
      about her daughter's mental health she said that she always seemed  to
      be ill and got depressed.


  29. I find B to be a credible witness. She is a British  citizen.  She  is
      living with her mother, her sister C and the appellant. She calls  the
      appellant by his first name. She is in touch with her  natural  father
      who went to Spain but returned recently. She calls him Dad. She has  a
      good relationship with the appellant. Her mother was unable to  attend
      the hearing because she was unwell. She confirmed that A and  D  would
      come and stay most weeks. She regards them as her brothers. She is  in
      college studying accountancy. She passed seven GCSEs at grade  C.  She
      said that the appellant and her mother had  lived  together  since  he
      came out of prison.


  30. I have letters from C, A, B and Ms Y. I have addressed the evidence of
      B and Ms Y, who gave oral evidence. C and A  ask  that  the  appellant
      should not be sent back to Jamaica. They speak of him as a caring  and
      attentive father figure.  A  says  that  the  appellant  supports  and
      encourages him at his cricket club.


  31. Section 32 (1) of the UK Borders Act 2007 ("the 2007 Act")  defines  a
      foreign criminal as a person who is not a British citizen who has been
      convicted in the United Kingdom of an offence and,  as  in  this  case
      (Condition 1), has been sentenced to a period of  imprisonment  of  at
      least 12 months. Under section 35 (4) of the 2007 Act, for the purpose
      of section 3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971, the deportation  of  a
      foreign  criminal  is  conducive  to  the  public   good.   In   these
      circumstances the Secretary of State must  make  a  deportation  order
      subject to Section 33  of  the  2007  Act  which  sets  out  statutory
      exceptions one of which is whether the removal  of  the  appellant  in
      pursuance of the deportation order would breach his Convention rights.
      The appellant claims that his removal would  infringe  his  Article  8
      human rights and those of his wife, children and family.


  32. I have considered whether I should apply the new Immigration Rules (HC
      194) introduced on 9 July 2012. In the light of the  determination  in
      MF (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012]  UKUT  00393  (IAC)  and  in
      particular paragraphs 58 to 60 I conclude that the application of  the
      new rules is not retrospective. The respondent's decision in this case
      was taken as long ago as 12 January 2009. I am not persuaded that  the
      new rules applied to the decision under appeal in this  case.  In  the
      circumstances I consider the Article 8 grounds in  the  light  of  the
      established jurisprudence and follow the framework set out  in  Razgar
      [2004] UKHL 27.

  33. I find that the appellant has established a private and family life in
      this country. Applying the tests set out by Lord Bingham in Razgar his
      removal would be an  interference  by  a  public  authority  with  the
      exercise of his right to respect for his private and family life.  The
      threshold is not a high one and I find that  such  interference  would
      have consequences  of  such  gravity  as  potentially  to  engage  the
      operation of Article 8. The interference would be in  accordance  with
      the law and necessary in a democratic  society  in  the  interests  of
      national security, public safety or the  economic  well-being  of  the
      country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for  the  protection
      of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and  freedoms
      of others. In this case  the  primary  factor  is  the  prevention  of
      disorder  or  crime.  The  final  conclusion  turns  on  whether  such
      interference is proportionate to the legitimate public end  sought  to
      be achieved.


  34. I turn first to the interests of the appellant's  children  and  treat
      them as a primary consideration. By this I mean not just the first  to
      be considered but also as a matter of substantial importance. I  treat
      as the appellant's children not only his natural  children  but  those
      who have to a greater or  lesser  extent  regarded  him  as  a  father
      figure. They are B, C, A, D and E. I have no  reports  from  a  social
      worker or the children's schools except a brief letter from  the  head
      teacher of C's school which confirms her attendance  and  states  that
      the appellant "takes a keen interest  in  all  of  the  activities  at
      ........ (school) and attends all parent evenings". E lives in Jamaica
      and does not have a family life with the appellant in this country. If
      the appellant were to return to Jamaica it is probable that they would
      see more of each other.  The  other  children  either  live  with  the
      appellant or see  him  regularly.  They  get  on  well  together.  The
      appellant is attached to them and they to him. He helps with sport and
      schoolwork. They do not want him to leave the country and  would  miss
      him a great deal if he left. Only two of the children  live  with  him
      all the time and all but E had to deal with his absence whilst he  was
      in prison. I have no objective evidence as to how the  children  coped
      whilst  the  appellant  was  in  prison  or  any  assessment  of   the
      consequences for their well-being if he had to leave the country.  All
      of them appear to enjoy good health. The  appellant  has  some  family
      life with Ms Y but wholly related to their son A.


  35. Because she did not attend the hearing and did not provide  a  witness
      statement the current relationship between the appellant and his  wife
      is not clear. They have been together since 2000 but there  have  been
      serious disagreements and periods of separation, the longest whilst he
      was in prison. The appellant's wife has recurring health problems  and
      depression although the regularity and seriousness of  these  are  not
      clear. It is not clear to what  extent  she  has  been  aware  of  the
      appellant's immigration status. However, she is a British  citizen  as
      are her children and although she has been to Jamaica on  holiday  she
      has not lived there. Her close  family  are  in  this  country  and  I
      conclude that it would not be reasonable to expect her or her children
      go and live in Jamaica. It would not be reasonable to expect the other
      children living in this country to go and live in Jamaica.


  36.  I  have  been  provided  with  very  little  information  about   the
      appellant's private life in this country although I accept that he has
      one. In the proportionality balance it adds a little  to  the  greater
      weight to be attached to family life.


  37. At times the appellant  has  worked  the  immigration  system  in  his
      favour. He has been an overstayer. His attendance record as a  student
      is not impressive. In order to remain  in  this  country  he  made  an
      asylum claim which he dropped as soon as he was able to apply to  stay
      on the basis of his marriage. However, he has had leave to  remain  in
      this country for most of the 14 years he has been  here.  He  has  one
      caution and three convictions for using cannabis and did not heed  his
      wife's strong objections to his use of cannabis which he did not  hide
      from her. He has been convicted  of  driving  without  insurance.  His
      conviction for dealing in cocaine is a very serious offence for  which
      he was sentenced to 40 months imprisonment. He was convicted following
      a plea of not guilty. Since then  he  has  been  convicted  of  drink-
      driving. The difficulties he has encountered  in  finding  work  could
      increase the risk of further drug  dealing.  The  appellant  does  not
      appear to have had any concern for the effect on his children  at  the
      time of the offence  which  led  to  his  conviction  for  dealing  in
      cocaine.


  38. The appellant's deportation would render it unlawful for him to return
      to this country whilst the deportation order remains in  force.  As  a
      consequence his deportation would be likely to  result  in  him  being
      separated from his family for a considerable period of time except for
      visits they could make to him if they could afford to do so and modern
      means of communication.


  39. I have had regard to what is said in SS (Nigeria) v SSHD  [2013]  EWCA
      Civ 550 and I attach considerable weight to the fact  that  Parliament
      has provided in primary legislation "a well justified  imperative  for
      the protection of the  public  and  to  reflect  the  public's  proper
      condemnation of serious wrongdoers". The 2007 Act gives  great  weight
      to the deportation of foreign criminals. The appellant  was  convicted
      of a serious offence of selling class A drugs. There is no independent
      evidence of the risk of  reoffending  but  I  take  into  account  his
      attitude to the criminal law shown by the caution and convictions  for
      using cannabis and motoring offences including drink-driving. There is
      no indication that further evidence about the  children,  for  example
      from an independent social worker, might make any difference. There is
      no  suggestion  of  existing  problems  which  might  require  further
      investigation.


  40. I have made an anonymity direction in order to protect  the  interests
      of the children.


  41. I find that the appellant's case under Article 8  and  especially  the
      interests of his children is not sufficiently strong to  prevail  over
      the extremely pressing public interest in his deportation.  I  dismiss
      the appellant's appeal.


      Direction regarding anonymity


      Unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  appellant
      is granted anonymity. No report of these proceedings shall directly or
      indirectly identify him or any member of their family. This  direction
      applies both to the appellant and to the respondent. Failure to comply
      with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
