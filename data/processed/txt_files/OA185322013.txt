For the Appellant:              Mr L Tarlow, Specialist Appeals Team
For the Respondent/Claimant:    Mr M Ahmed, Solicitor, Lincoln's Chambers
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Specialist Appeals Team appeals on behalf  of  an  Entry  Clearance
    Officer from the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal to refuse her entry clearance  as  the  spouse  of  a
    person present and settled here.  The First-tier Tribunal did not  make
    an anonymity direction, and I do not consider that the claimant or  her
    spouse requires anonymity for these proceedings in the Upper  Tribunal.



 2. The claimant is a national of Bangladesh.  She married her  sponsor  in
    Bangladesh on 1 May 2009, which was also the day on  which  they  first
    met.  In her application form, she said she had last seen  her  sponsor
    on 17 July 2009.  They had a child, T, who had been born in  Bangladesh
    on 25 March 2010.  T had British nationality through her  father.   The
    sponsor, Abdul Towahid, had been living in the UK since December  2002.
    He had two sources of income.  He earned an annual income before tax of
    �14,400 from his employment by Daioo Event Organising  Limited,  a  job
    which he had had since 1 April 2012. His second source of income was as
    an employee of the Khyber Pass Restaurant in Knaphill, Woking,  Surrey.
    He had been in employment with this restaurant since 27 July 2009.  His
    total income before tax from salaried employment in the  twelve  months
    prior to the application was �21,472.

 3. The application was made on 5 June 2013, and  it  was  refused  in  two
    stages.  It was initially refused  on  25  August  2013.   One  of  the
    reasons for refusal was that the  claimant  did  not  meet  the  income
    threshold requirement under Appendix FM and/or the  related  evidential
    requirements under Appendix FM-SE.  However, no final determination was
    made at this stage as to whether the claimant met the income  threshold
    and/or related evidential requirements because the Court of Appeal  had
    not yet decided the outcome of the Secretary of  State's  appeal  in  a
    legal challenge to the income threshold requirement.

 4. The application was refused for a second time on 10 September  2014  on
    the same grounds as before.  In respect of the  financial  requirement,
    the Entry Clearance Officer continued to insist that the  claimant  had
    failed to provide the specified documents in respect of  her  sponsor's
    employment by Khyber Pass Restaurant.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The claimant's appeal came before a panel chaired by  Designated  Judge
    First-tier Tribunal Macdonald sitting at Taylor  House  on  23  October
    2014.  Mr Ahmed appeared on behalf  of  the  claimant,  and  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer was represented by a Home Office Presenting  Officer.
    The  sponsor  gave  oral  evidence.   In  addition  to  his   permanent
    employment with Event Organising Limited of �14,400 per annum, he  said
    he had been working part-time twenty hours per  week  for  Khyber  Pass
    Restaurant.  His annual salary  from  this  employment  was  just  over
    �7,000.  He firmly asserted that the documents he  had  submitted  were
    authentic and genuine.  He explained that he was paid in cash,  and  he
    explained why the sums that he was paid did not always tally  with  the
    sums credited to his bank account.

 6. In his  subsequent  decision,  Judge  Macdonald  set  out  the  panel's
    findings at  paragraphs  [18]  to  [20].   The  panel  found  that  the
    relationship between the claimant  and  the  sponsor  was  genuine  and
    subsisting, and that the parties to the marriage genuinely intended  to
    live together permanently as husband and wife in  the  United  Kingdom.
    He went on in paragraph [20] to address the other issue  which  was  in
    dispute,  namely  whether  the   claimant   satisfied   the   financial
    requirements.  He said:

         Wage slips from Khyber Pass Restaurant say that  he  was  regularly
         paid by cash setting out the sums paid over a  significant  period.
         We also have relevant certificates from his  other  employer  Event
         Organising Limited which again show he was paid in cash.  We should
         say that we have not previously seen vouching of this nature  which
         has the words 'paid in cash' typed on it.  This causes us to  pause
         on the issue of whether these documents  are  genuine,  but  having
         found the sponsor credible in terms of the  relationship  with  his
         wife we are prepared to give  him  the  benefit  of  the  doubt  in
         relation to documents which if  genuine  prove  that  he  earns  in
         excess of the required threshold.   In  the  circumstances  we  are
         accepting that documents are genuine and it therefore follows  that
         the maintenance requirements are  met.   From  these  findings  the
         appeal must therefore  be  allowed  under  the  Immigration  Rules.
         There is no need to consider Article 8 ECHR.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

 7. A member of the Specialist Appeals  Team  settled  an  application  for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.   He  said  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge had materially erred in law in ignoring paragraph  2  of
    Appendix FM which stipulated that all of the following evidence must be
    provided in terms of salaried employment in the UK:

    (a)  wage slips covering:

         (1)  a period of six months prior to the date of application ...

    (c)  personal bank statements corresponding to the same period  as  the
         wage slips at paragraph 2(a) showing that the salary has been  paid
         into an account in the name of the person or their partner jointly.



 8. The claimant had failed to provide bank statements showing income  from
    both employments  being  paid  into  the  sponsor's  account.   At  the
    hearing, the sponsor accepted he did not deposit  the  money  into  his
    bank account.  There was a lack  of  specified  evidence  submitted  to
    substantiate the claimed income based on the  operating  principles  of
    Appendix FM-SE.   These  operating  principles  within  Appendix  FM-SE
    ensured that a person's income was  properly  evidenced  and  would  be
    sustainable.  So in allowing the appeal, the Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal erred in  law  by  failing  to  apply  the  Immigration  Rules
    correctly.  Clearly the claimant could not  meet  the  requirements  of
    Appendix  FM-SE  for  the  six  month  period  prior  to  the  date  of
    application.  These  are  mandatory  requirements,  and  therefore  the
    claimant could not succeed under the Rules.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

 9. On 23 December 2014  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  V  P  McDade  granted
    permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         It is arguable that the panel of judges did not adequately  explore
         the  sponsor's  claimed  income  given  the  absence  of  specified
         evidence,  particularly  given  the  panel's  doubts  as   to   the
         genuineness of the payslips before deciding to give the sponsor the
         benefit of those doubts.  There is an arguable error of law.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

10. At the hearing before me, Mr Ahmed mounted  a  robust  defence  of  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  He acknowledged that the  grounds
    of appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  were  factually  correct.   The  bank
    statements  did  not  show  the  wages  from  either  employment  being
    deposited into the sponsor's bank account.  He  deposited  money  on  a
    regular basis into his bank account, but this was less than what he was
    actually paid in cash.  So under the strict  letter  of  the  law,  the
    claimant did  not  fully  meet  the  Rules.   But  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities the sponsor was earning above the required minimum income
    threshold, and so, Mr Ahmed submitted, it was  open  to  the  panel  to
    allow his appeal under the Rules.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

11. The Rules are black letter law, and the panel therefore had to,  in  Mr
    Ahmed's words, apply the strict letter of the law.  The panel could not
    ignore a mandatory requirement of the Rules.  The lack  of  correlation
    between the wage slips and the bank statements was not  something  that
    had been specifically ventilated in  the  refusal  decision.   But  the
    Entry Clearance Officer/Manager had consistently  maintained  that  the
    claimant had not discharged the burden of  proving  that  she  met  the
    financial requirements, and in particular  had  not  provided  all  the
    mandatory documents required by Appendix FM-SE.

12. It is clear from paragraph [16]  of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that in the course of  the  hearing  it  was  brought  to  the
    panel's attention that the bank statements did not show the receipt  by
    the sponsor of his wages.  Although Khyber Pass Restaurant had issued a
    P60 in respect of the claimant's employment in the tax  year  to  April
    2013, this was of little  probative  value  as  the  claimant  did  not
    purport to be earning enough from his employment for  his  employer  to
    have to account to HMRC for either tax or national insurance.   But  in
    any event a P60 is an optional piece of evidence under Appendix  FM-SE,
    whereas the requirement  to  provide  informative  bank  statements  is
    mandatory.  The bank statements provided by the claimant needed to show
    that his claimed salary  had  been  paid  into  his  account.   It  was
    apparent to the panel that the bank statements  did  not  perform  this
    function, so it was not open to the panel to allow the appeal under the
    Rules.

The Remaking of the Appeal

13. As discussed in my error of law decision, this  appeal  cannot  succeed
    under the Rules.  Because the panel wrongly allowed  the  appeal  under
    the Rules, they did not consider an alternative claim under  Article  8
    ECHR.

14. When upholding the refusal decision, the Entry Clearance Manager in his
    review dated 10 September  2014  gave  his  reasons  for  rejecting  an
    alternative claim under Article 8 ECHR.  There was no evidence  at  all
    from either the claimant or the sponsor that they would not be able  to
    live in Bangladesh. The sponsor was born in  Bangladesh,  and  did  not
    require a visa to live there.  The claimant had chosen to enter into an
    arranged marriage with someone living in another country, and  she  was
    aware that marriage in itself would not guarantee  that  she  would  be
    assured entry to the UK.   The  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
    control was important, especially where  in  cases  such  as  this  the
    claimant was unable to satisfy the requirements  of  a  legitimate  and
    proper Immigration Rule.  Alternatively, the sponsor was free to  visit
    Bangladesh whenever he was able to do so,  as  well  as  continuing  to
    remain in regular contact with the claimant using all modern  forms  of
    communication.  The claimant and the sponsor did not have  an  inherent
    right to decide where to establish a family life, and it  was  open  to
    the claimant to go to Bangladesh or elsewhere.

15. It was not suggested by Mr Ahmed that there are or were  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life continuing outside the UK.   So  the  claimant
    does not qualify for Article 8 relief under EX.1(b).

16. Turning to an Article 8 claim outside the Rules, Article 8(1)  ECHR  is
    only weakly engaged as the interference consequential upon the  refusal
    decision need only be temporary.  If the sponsor is telling  the  truth
    about his annual salary, as the panel found he was, there should be  no
    difficulty in the  claimant  providing  in  due  course  the  mandatory
    specified evidence to show that she meets the income threshold, by  way
    of a fresh application for entry clearance.  It is open to the  sponsor
    to rearrange his affairs so that he pays his net salary into  his  bank
    account, without making any deductions beforehand.

17. Questions three and four of the Razgar test must be answered in  favour
    of the Entry Clearance Officer.

18. On the issue of proportionality, Mr Ahmed  relies  on  the  proposition
    that it is contrary to the child's best interests for his mother to  be
    denied entry clearance.  But the refusal  of  entry  clearance  to  the
    child's mother does not prevent the child coming to the United Kingdom,
    as it is open to the sponsor to go and collect him and bring  him  back
    here.  Although the child is a British national, I  consider  that  the
    child's best interests lie in him remaining with his  mother,  wherever
    she happens to be.  For at the time of decision the child had never met
    his father, and his mother had been his primary carer since birth.

19. On the wider proportionality assessment, there  are  no  compelling  or
    compassionate factors which justify the claimant being granted  Article
    8 relief outside the Rules.  I  have  taken  into  account  the  public
    interest considerations set out in Section 117B of the 2006 Act, and  I
    consider that the most pertinent consideration on  the  facts  of  this
    case is that contained in subparagraph (1), namely that the maintenance
    of effective immigration  controls  is  in  the  public  interest.   My
    conclusion is that the  interference  consequential  upon  the  refusal
    decision is proportionate.










Notice of Decision

The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  the  claimant's  appeal
under the Rules contained an error of law, and accordingly the  decision  is
set aside and the following decision is  substituted:  this  appeal  against
the refusal of entry clearance  is  dismissed  under  the  Rules  and  under
Article 8 ECHR.

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction.
