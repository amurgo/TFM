Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Islam, of London Law Associates
For the Respondent:    Mr K Norton, Senior Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS
                       (Given orally on 29 April 2016)

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh, born on 10 October  1984.  He
    appeals against a decision of  an  Entry  Clearance  Officer  dated  17
    September 2014 refusing to grant him entry clearance as the spouse of a
    Mrs Nipa Begum, a person present and settled in the United Kingdom.

 2. The First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Cohen)  dismissed  this  appeal  in  a
    decision promulgated on 28 August  2015.   During  the  course  of  his
    determination Judge Cohen, contrary to the  conclusions  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer, found the appellant and Mrs Begum to be in a genuine
    and subsisting relationship and  that  they  intend  to  live  together
    permanently (see paragraph 2 of Judge Cohen's decision).

 3. Judge Cohen also came to the following conclusion:

         "[15] I firstly note that the sponsor had not been in both  of  her
         claimed employments  for  at  least  six  months  at  the  date  of
         application and therefore [sic] find that the appellant  could  not
         meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules as at  the  date  of
         application and had not submitted the  mandatory  documentation  to
         show that the  sponsor  had  been  employed  in  those  employments
         earning a minimum of �18,600 for the six-month  period  immediately
         prior to the date of application.   I  find  that  the  appellant's
         application under the Immigration Rules is bound to fail."

 4. In relation to the claimed  employment  at  a  company  called  Chadnis
    Indian Cuisine Limited, Judge Cohen further said this at paragraph 16:

         "I find that she is not genuinely working at this restaurant in the
         claimed capacity or at all and find that  she  does  not  [sic]  he
         claimed income arising from  this  employment.   I  find  that  the
         sponsor has created documentation to  substantiate  a  false  claim
         that she has sufficient income to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
         Rules."

 5. In relation to  a  further  employment  that  it  is  said  Miss  Begum
    undertook at Kashmir Gardens, Judge Cohen found at paragraph 17:

         "I find that she is not genuinly working at this restaurant in  the
         claimed capacity or at all and find that  she  does  not  [sic]  he
         claimed income arising  from  this  employment.  I  find  that  the
         sponsor has created documentation to  substantiate  a  false  claim
         that she has sufficient income to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
         Immigration Rules."

 6. The rationale  for  these  conclusions  can  be  deduced  from  reading
    paragraphs 8, 16 and 17 of the FtT's decision.   These  findings  were,
    however, clearly made in the alternative to the  primary  finding  that
    the  appellant  had  failed  to   produce   the   necessary   specified
    documemntation  and  therefore   could   not   meet   the   evidenetial
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

 7. The appellant appeals to the Upper  Tribunal  with  the  permission  of
    Judge Southern granted on 17 February 2016.  The  grounds  are  lengthy
    but can be distilled into the following two propslitions:

          i) The First-tier Tribunal was incorrect  to  conclude  that  the
             appellant did not meet the financial requirements of the Rules
             because he had provided all of the necessary documentation and
             evidence to demonstrate that his wife earnt over  the  miniuim
             requirement of �18,600; and,

         ii) The First-tier Tribunal's finding that  the  sponsor  was  not
             employed in the Kashmir Gardens restautant or  Chadnis  Indian
             Cuisine Limited was unfair because the  genuineness  of  these
             employments was not a point taken by the ECO or otherwise  put
             in issue. In any event, the conclusions  in  this  regard  are
             irrational.

 8. In granting permission Judge Southern said as follows:

         "The grounds assert, confidently and  without  qualification,  that
         the judge simply misunderstood the documentary evidence before him.
         Had he examined this documentary evidence  porpery  he  would  have
         seen that it did in  fact  demonstrate  precisely  that  which  was
         required by the applicable Immigration Rules.  As that assertion is
         made by legal  representatives,  whose  duty  not  to  mislead  the
         Tribunal is a seious and a fundamental one ... I must accept it  to
         be correct and on that baiss will grant  permission.    London  Law
         Associates must comply with the following directions:

         Directions:

         No later than 10 working days from the date upon which  this  grant
         of  permission  is  sent  out  to  the  parties,  the   appellant's
         representatives must file with the  Tribunal  and  serve  upon  the
         respondent a chronology setting out  clearly  the  history  of  the
         beginning and end of each  of  the  sponsor's  employments  and  an
         indexed and paginated bundle  containing  copies  of  each  of  the
         documents relied upon to establish the sponsor's  income  including
         each of the documents specifically referred to in the  grounds  for
         seeking permission to appeal."

 9. It is important to set out  the  relevant  evidential  requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE to  the  Immigration  Rules,  which  the  appellant  was
    required  to  meet.  Both  parties  agree  that  it  is  the  following
    requirements in paragraph A1(2) to Appendix FM-SE which are applicable:


        "(2) In respect of salaried  employment  in  the  UK  (except  where
         paragraph 9  applies),  all  of  the  following  evidence  must  be
         provided:
             (a)  Payslips covering:
                  (i)  a period of 6 months prior to the date of application
                      if the person has  been  employed  by  their  current
                      employer for at least 6 months ... ; or
                  (ii)     any period of salaried employment in  the  period
                       of 12 months prior to the date of application if  the
                       person has been employed by  their  current  employer
                       for less than 6 months... .
             (b)  A letter from the employer(s) who issued the payslips  at
                  paragraph 2(a) confirming:
                  (i)  the person's employment and gross annual salary;
                  (ii)     the length of their employment;
                  (iii)    the period over which they have been or were paid
                      the level of salary relied upon in  the  application;
                      and
                  (iv)     the type  of  employment  (permanent,  fixed-term
             contract or agency)."

10. It is pertinent at this point to identify the date of  the  application
    to the Entry Clearance Officer which was, at  least  according  to  the
    appellant's chronology, made on the 20  July  2014.  Thus,  six  months
    prior to this date would be 21 January 2014.  It is also  necessary  to
    set out the relevant terms of the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  refusal
    decision which, in relation to the financial requirements of the Rules,
    states as follows:

         ".... From the payslips you have submitted I have  calculated  your
         gross  annual  income  as  �24,612.   However,  at  the   time   of
         application, your sponsor had been employed in both jobs  for  less
         than six months.  Given this you must meet the requirements set out
         in Appendix FM-SE,  specifically  that  the  gross  amount  of  any
         speicified non-employment income received by their partner  in  the
         twelve months prior to the date of application must be  �18,600  or
         above.  However, I am unable  to  do  this  because  you  have  not
         submitted  all  the   documents   required   by   Appendix   FM-SE.
         Specifically, you have not provided an employer  letter  from  your
         previous employer,  Studio  71,  which  contains  details  of  your
         sponsor's employment, their gross  annual  salary,  the  length  of
         their employment, the period over which they have  been  paid,  the
         level of income relied upon in the  application  and  the  type  of
         employment.  You also have to provide bank statements showing  that
         the salary has been paid into an account in the name of the person.
         I reocngise that you submitted some bank statements  but  these  do
         not cover the whole twelve  month  period  prior  to  the  date  of
         decision.

         I note that this office contacted you on two occasions  (14/08/2014
         and  26/08/2014)  offering  you  the  chance  to  provide   missing
         documents, but you have not done this."

11. At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal  Mr  Islam  properly  accepted
    that the requirements of subparagraph A2(a) of Appendix FM-SE could not
    be met by the appellant because his  'partner'  was  not,  on  his  own
    chronology, employed by Kashmir Gardens Aylesbury Limited for a  period
    of six months prior to  the  date  of  application  -  that  employment
    starting on or around 6 April 2014 - and neither was  she  employed  by
    Chadnis Indian Cuisine Limited for the entirety of the six month period
    prior to the date of application, because this comppnay was only set up
    during that period and she only began employment with it on 1  February
    2014. Prior to that, on the appellant's  case,  his  partner  had  been
    employed with Chadnis Aylesbury Limited. Although it is said that  this
    had the same members of staff, operated from the same property and  had
    the same management structure it is, nevertheless,  a  different  legal
    entity  and  thus  appellant's  partner's  employer  changed  after   1
    February.

12. Consequently, as Mr Islam properly accepted during the  course  of  the
    hearing, the appellant needed to demonstrate that the  requirements  of
    the rule had been met in relation  to  the  employment  at  Stuidio  71
    and/or Chadnis Aylesbury Limited.

13. It is to be recalled that the Entry Clearance Officer specifically took
    the point in the refusal letter that in relation to Studio 71 there was
    no letter  from  the  "employer"  incorporating  all  of  the  features
    required  of  it  by  paragraph  A1(2)(b)  of  Appendix  FM-SE  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  Again, Mr Islam properly accepted this  to  be  so,
    explaining that compliance with the rule was impossible because  Studio
    71 had ceased to exist by the date of the appellant's application.

14.  Initially  it  appeared  that  Mr  Islam  was  submitting   that   the
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE  could  be  met  by  the  production  of
    documentation other than of the type specified therein.   If  this  was
    indeed intended to be the submission then it is plainly incorrect.  The
    requirements of the Rule are clear and the documents specified  therein
    must be produced if such requirements are to be met.

15. The production of alternative documentation in lieu of  that  specified
    in the Rules goes to the exercise of discretion outside the  Rules,  as
    was subsequently  accepted  by  Mr  Islam  during  the  course  of  his
    submissions.  Turning to that issue, Mr Islam asserted that neither the
    ECO nor the First-tier Tribunal had considered this matter. This though
    is unsurprising because neither was asked to.  The covering  letter  to
    the  entry  clearance  application  drafted  by  a  firm  called  'Your
    Immigration Limited' boldy asserts that the requirements  of  the  rule
    have been met.  It says nothing of the failure to produce  a  specified
    document, or the reasons for such a failure. Neither was this  a  point
    taken before the First-tier Tribunal as Mr Islam once again accepts.

16. If neither the Entry Clearance Officer nor the First-tier Tribunal were
    asked to consider this issue it cannot be demonstrated in my view  that
    the First-tier Tribunal erred for failing to do  so.   The  Immigration
    Rules cannot be met, no submission was made that discretion  should  be
    exercised outside of the rules  and  it  was  not  for  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to take such a point of its own volition.

17. This conclusion seems to  me  to  entirely  accord  with  the  reported
    decision of the President in the case of  Sultana  and  Others  (Rules:
    waiver/further enquiry; discretion) [2014] UKUT 540 (IAC).

18. For these reasons I conclude that the appellant fails to make  out  the
    first of the aforementioned grounds.

19. As to the ground relating  to  the  findings  that  the  appellant  had
    produced fraudulent documentation in support of her claims - this was a
    finding made by the First-tier Tribunal in the alternative and  it  had
    no material impact on  the  outcome  of  the  appeal.  However,  it  is
    necessary for me to express a view on this ground because such findings
    are likely to impact on any future application made by  the  appellant.
    For my part, I conclude that such findings are vitiated by legal error.
    There was no dispute between the parties as to the geneuineness of  the
    appellant's partner's claimed employment, and the  respondent  was  not
    represented at the hearing to  put  the  matter  in  issue.  The  judge
    clearly entered the arena in this regard. Having done so he should have
    put the appellant's legal representative on notice as to  what  was  in
    his mind and given the sponsor an opportunity to directly  address  the
    issue of whether the documents produced were false. He did not  do  so.
    For this reason, although not material to the  FtT's  decision,  it  is
    clear that no  future  reliance  should  be  placed  on  Judge  Cohen's
    findings in this regard.

Notice of Decision

The  appeal  is  dismissed.  The  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision   remains
standing.
