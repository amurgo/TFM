Representation:
For the appellant:
For the respondent:

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Decision and reasons

1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the  First-
   tier Tribunal to refuse to revoke a deportation order made  on  26  March
   2015  pursuant  to  Regulations  19(3)(b)  and  Regulation  21   of   the
   Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (as amended).   The
   appellant is a citizen of Poland.

2. The reason for the deportation order is set out in a decision  letter  on
   26 March 2015, following a stage 1 deportation letter sent to an  address
   in Linnet Street, Preston on 8 November 2014, to which the appellant  had
   not responded.

3.  In  her  deportation  decision,  the  respondent  stated  that  she  was
   satisfied, pursuant to Regulation 21, that the appellant posed a genuine,
   present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the  fundamental
   interests  of  society.   The  deportation  order  was  certified   under
   Regulation 24AA(2) on the basis that the appellant's  removal  to  Poland
   pending the outcome of any appeal against the  deportation  order,  would
   not be unlawful under section 6 of the  Human  Rights  Act  1998  (public
   authority not to act contrary to Human Rights Convention).

4. Two convictions were relied upon:

   a) The appellant committed two offences of robbery and attempted  robbery
      on different dates in November 2003, for which he was convicted at the
      Regional Court  in  Warsaw,  Poland,  on  19  October  2005.   He  was
      sentenced to 42 months' imprisonment and a fine of  500  Polish  zloty
      (about �107).

   b) On 30 June 2014, soon after arriving in the United Kingdom, and before
      his wife joined him here, the appellant  was  involved  in  a  drunken
      altercation, and the police were called.  On 22 October 2014,  he  was
      convicted of battery at Preston Magistrates  Court,  sentenced  to  18
      weeks' imprisonment wholly suspended for 12  months,  and  ordered  to
      undertake an unpaid work requirement, and pay compensation of �250,  a
      victim surcharge of �80, and costs.

5. The respondent served the deportation order  to  the  file,  having  been
   unable to serve it on the appellant at his  last  known  address  in  the
   immigration proceedings. The respondent made only one attempt  at  postal
   service at an  address  in  Linnet  Street,  Preston.   However,  in  the
   criminal proceedings, the appellant had given a later address  in  Raikes
   Road, Preston.  The Raikes Road address also appears on  the  appellant's
   housing benefit claim and the  notification  of  his  National  Insurance
   number. No attempt was made to serve at that address.

6. The effect of service to file was that the appellant had  no  opportunity
   to challenge the deportation decision by appeal or judicial review, or to
   apply  under  Regulation  24AA(4)  for  an   interim   order   suspending
   enforcement of the deportation decision pending such a challenge.

7. The appellant only became aware of the deportation order  when  returning
   from Poland with his wife and young child on 9 January 2016, following  a
   two-day visit to his widowed mother in  Poland.  By  that  date,  he  was
   living at an address in Chestnut Grove, Preston.  He was not  allowed  to
   board the plane and is now working in Belgium.





First-tier Tribunal decision

8. The appellant appealed against the respondent's decision  to  the  First-
   tier Tribunal, arguing that it was not lawfully made in  accordance  with
   the Regulations and her own  policy.   First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Lever
   dismissed the appeal both under the Regulations and  on  Article  8  ECHR
   grounds.  The appellant appealed again to the Upper Tribunal.

Permission to appeal

9. The appellant's grounds  of  appeal  were,  first,  a  challenge  to  the
   adequacy of the First-tier Tribunal's reasoning  on  how  the  respondent
   discharged the burden of showing that  the  appellant  posed  a  genuine,
   present and sufficiently serious threat' at the date of decision; second,
   the failure to  consider  material  evidence  regarding  the  appellant's
   Article 8 ECHR  rights;  and  thirdly,  failure  to  assess  whether  the
   respondent had complied with her own policy in relation  to  serving  the
   decision on file.

10. Permission to  appeal  was  granted  for  two  main  reasons,  that  the
   respondent had arguably not discharged the burden of  showing  a  genuine
   present and sufficiently serious threat in the United  Kingdom  from  the
   appellant; and whether the Polish offence was  a  proper  basis  for  the
   making of, and refusal to revoke a deportation order for an EEA national,
   given that past convictions alone do not justify such a decision.

11. The grant of permission imposes no limitation on the grounds  of  appeal
   and all grounds may be argued.

Rule 24 Reply

12. The respondent filed a  Rule  24  Reply,  arguing  that  the  First-tier
   Tribunal had taken account of both  the  conviction  in  Poland  and  the
   United Kingdom conviction.  The Reply continues:

         "2.  ...Whilst it is stated  that  the  appellant  did  not  offend
         subsequently and no consideration has  been  taken  of  this,  this
         fails to give regard to the fact that the appellant was  in  prison
         for approximately 3� years following his sentence in 2004, and  his
         departure from the United Kingdom in 2016.

         3.   The Judge was entitled to  consider  the  appellant's  actions
         since arriving in the United Kingdom  and  it  is  noted  that  the
         appellant's offences were committed in a relatively short period of
         time after his arrival."

13. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Upper Tribunal hearing

14. It is accepted on the appellant's behalf that due to the brevity of  his
   time in the United Kingdom (less than 2 years), he  has  not  acquired  a
   permanent right of residence and is entitled only to the basic  level  of
   protection under Regulation 21.  Regulations 21(3) and 21(4) do not apply
   here.

15. For the appellant, Mr Medley-Daley reminded me that with  the  exception
   of his widowed  mother,  who  had  returned  to  Poland  after  her  late
   husband's death, all of the  appellant's  extended  family  live  in  the
   United Kingdom, including his 2 children aged 8 and 2 years old, and  his
   wife.  The Regulations require more than a  past  conviction  to  justify
   removal (see 21(5)(e)) and there was, he argued, no evidence of a present
   risk from this appellant at the date of making the deportation  order  in
   March 2015, or indeed now.  The appellant's wife is herself  a  qualified
   person, since she has been both a worker  and  a  student  while  in  the
   United Kingdom.   His  primary  submission  was  that  the  decision  was
   disproportionate and the high test in Regulation 21 was not met,  on  the
   facts.

16. Mr Medley-Daley also argued that the deportation order was not  lawfully
   made.  The respondent's policy required her to have made 'all  reasonable
   attempts' to serve at the appellant's last known address,  but  in  fact,
   only one letter was sent.  There were plenty of other reasonable attempts
   which could have been made, but were  not.   The  police  had  the  right
   address and so did several other government bodies.   The  appellant  had
   not been given the opportunity to make representations at the first stage
   of the deportation  process,  due  to  the  respondent's  error  in  this
   respect.

17.  The  respondent's  own  internal  emails  showed  concern   about   the
   lawfulness of the deportation order and whether it had ever been  signed.
   The respondent's decision to refuse to revoke the deportation  order  was
   perverse and irrational, taking no  account  of  the  facts  or  her  own
   policy.  If the deportation order was not validly made,  the  appellant's
   continued exclusion from the United Kingdom  was  unlawful  and  a  plain
   breach of his Article 8 rights, and the section 55 best interests of  his
   children.

18. He relied on the  provisions  of  Regulation  24A,  which  required  the
   respondent to revoke a deportation or exclusion  order  where  there  had
   been a material change in the circumstances which justified the making of
   the order, if she considered that the criteria for making such  an  order
   were no longer satisfied.  Such an application could only be  made  while
   the appellant was outside the United Kingdom.

19. The appellant also relied on the lack of opportunity for  the  appellant
   to provide information which could be taken into account under Regulation
   24AA(2) and (3), or to make an application under Regulation 24AA(4).

20. For the respondent, Mr Bates observed  that  the  question  whether  the
   deportation order had ever been signed did not appear in the  grounds  of
   appeal.  The Upper Tribunal should limit its consideration to the matters
   set out in the grant of permission to appeal. The decision to deport  the
   appellant took into account both his Polish  conviction  and  his  United
   Kingdom conviction, which had occurred just 6 weeks after  his  entry  to
   the United Kingdom community.  That was not evidence  that  he  had  been
   rehabilitated from the Polish offence.

21. On  the  question  of  rehabilitation,  Mr  Bates  relied  on  MC  (Essa
   principles recast) [2015] UKUT 520 (IAC). The appellant had complied with
   the unpaid work requirements, paid his fines, and not  re-offended  since
   his United Kingdom conviction.  However, neither  the  statement  of  the
   appellant, nor that of his wife, explained the motive for  his  offences,
   or how the appellant had addressed his offending behaviour.   The  wife's
   evidence was that the appellant never drank alcohol,  save  on  this  one
   occasion, when she was not with him.  The appellant's statement  did  not
   make the same assertion.

22. As regards the validity of the  deportation  order,  Mr  Bates  had  not
   prepared to argue this point but did not wish for further time to  submit
   his  argument  on  this  point.  Whether  or  not   the   appellant   was
   rehabilitated, there were cogent reasons for  upholding  the  deportation
   decision, since the appellant had demonstrated a propensity for violence.



23. The appellant's partner was in the United  Kingdom  exercising  her  own
   Treaty rights here, but she could equally take the children and join  him
   in Belgium, or anywhere else in the European Union.

24. Mr Bates accepted that the case  was  not  straightforward,  but  argued
   that the First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision was properly reasoned, open
   to him on the evidence, and contained no material error of law.

Error of law finding

25.  There  were  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  documents  which   cast
   significant doubt on the legality, and compliance  with  policy,  of  the
   respondent's decisions to make the deportation order and to serve  it  to
   file.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge omitted to consider those  documents
   at [21]-[26] of the decision.  He also treats knowledge by the police  as
   separate from knowledge by the Home Office, but  of  course,  the  police
   form part of the Home Secretary's responsibilities and  that  distinction
   cannot properly be made.

26. The stage 1 deportation notice was sent to the appellant's address on  8
   November 2014.  On 17  November  2014,  the  Justices  Clerk  at  Preston
   Magistrates Court wrote to the appellant at Raikes Road.  On  6  February
   2015, Preston City Council wrote  to  the  appellant  about  his  housing
   benefit at Raikes Road. On 26 March 2015 the deportation order was served
   to file on the basis  that  the  Home  Office  did  not  know  where  the
   appellant could be found and that he was an absconder.  It was  an  error
   of fact amounting to an error of law for the First-tier Tribunal Judge to
   conclude that the respondent was justified  in  serving  the  deportation
   decision directly to file, without first attempting to serve it at either
   Linnett Road or, by making straightforward enquiries, to the Raikes  Road
   address.

27. Secondly, the appellant alleges that the Judge failed to  refer  to  the
   evidence from the appellant's spouse, who is exercising Treaty rights  in
   the United Kingdom.  The appellant  contends  that  the  Judge  does  not
   appear to have addressed his mind to the Regulation 21(5) factors  or  to
   Regulation 21(6) in deciding that his exclusion from the  United  Kingdom
   would be proportionate.  Both Regulations are mentioned in  the  decision
   at [27] but at [30]-[31], the Judge did not directly address the  factors
   set out in those  Regulations,  proceeding  by  analogy  under  paragraph
   339(a) of the Immigration Rules, which was deleted some time ago.   There
   is a detailed  discussion  of  the  section  55  best  interests  of  the
   appellant's children, which the Judge accepts lie  in  their  being  with
   both parents.

28. The reasoning in the decision on Regulation 21(5)  is  at  [28]  and  is
   plainly inadequate.  The Judge does not engage with the question  whether
   the appellant presents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat
   to the United Kingdom; nor  is  there  any  detailed  assessment  of  the
   proportionality of the deportation decision.

29. I am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal decision  contains  material
   errors of law as set out above and I proceed to remake the decision.

Remaking the decision

EEA Regulations

30. The standard to which the deportation decision must  be  made  where  an
   EEA national is to be removed is set out at Regulation 21(5) and 21(6) of
   the 2006 Regulations:

         "(5)     Where a relevant decision is taken on  grounds  of  public
         policy or public security it shall, in addition to  complying  with
         the preceding paragraphs of this regulation, be taken in accordance
         with the following principles-

             (a)   the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
             proportionality;
             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
                  conduct of the person concerned;
             (c)   the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned  must
                  represent a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
                  threat affecting  one  of  the  fundamental  interests  of
                  society;
             (d)  matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
                  which relate to considerations of  general  prevention  do
                  not justify the decision;
             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
                  themselves justify the decision.

         (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on  the  grounds  of  public
         policy or public security in relation to a person who  is  resident
         in the United Kingdom the  decision  maker  must  take  account  of
         considerations such  as  the  age,  state  of  health,  family  and
         economic situation of the person, the person's length of  residence
         in the United Kingdom, the person's social and cultural integration
         into the United Kingdom and the extent of the person's  links  with
         his country of origin. "

31. Regulation 24A is entitled 'Revocation of deportation and exclusion
   orders' and is as follows, so far as relevant to this appeal:

         "24A.-(1) A deportation or exclusion order shall remain  in  force
         unless  it  is  revoked  by  the  Secretary  of  State  under  this
         regulation.

         (2) A person who is subject to a deportation or exclusion order may
         apply to the Secretary of State to have it revoked  if  the  person
         considers  that  there  has  been  a   material   change   in   the
         circumstances that justified the making of the order.

         (3) An application under paragraph (2) shall set out the  material
         change in circumstances relied upon by the applicant and  may  only
         be made whilst the applicant is outside the United Kingdom.

         (4) On receipt of an application under paragraph (2), the Secretary
         of State shall revoke the order if the Secretary of State considers
         that the  criteria  for  making  such  an  order  are  no  longer
         satisfied."

32. Regulation 24AA is entitled 'Human  rights  considerations  and  interim
   orders to suspend removal' and so far as relevant, says this:


         "24AA.-(1) This regulation applies where the  Secretary  of  State
         intends to give directions for the removal of  a  person  ("P")  to
         whom regulation 24(3) applies, in circumstances where-

             (a)  P has not appealed against  the EEA decision  to  which
             regulation 24(3) applies, but would be entitled,  and  remains
             within time, to do so from within the United Kingdom (ignoring
             any possibility of an appeal out of time with permission); ...

         (2) The Secretary of State may only give directions for P's removal
         if the Secretary of  State  certifies  that,  despite  the  appeals
         process  not  having  been  begun  or  not  having   been   finally
         determined, removal of P to the country or territory to which P  is
         proposed to be removed, pending the outcome of  P's  appeal,  would
         not be unlawful under section  6  of  the  Human  Rights  Act  1998
         (public authority not to act contrary to Human Rights Convention).

         (3) The grounds upon which the Secretary of State  may  certify  a
         removal under paragraph (2) include (in particular)  that  P  would
         not, before the appeal is finally determined, face a real  risk  of
         serious irreversible harm if removed to the country or territory to
         which P is proposed to be removed.

         (4) If P applies to the appropriate court or tribunal (whether  by
         means of judicial review or otherwise)  for  an  interim  order  to
         suspend enforcement of the removal decision, P may not  be  removed
         from the United Kingdom until such time  as  the  decision  on  the
         interim order has been taken, except-


   The exceptions in Regulation 24AA(4) are not applicable here.

Respondent's policy guidance

33. The guidance to caseworkers which was  in  force  at  the  time  of  the
   decision to deport was contained  in  version  4.0  of  the  respondent's
   European Economic Area (EEA) Foreign National Offender Cases guidance, as
   follows:

         "Lengths of sentence and UK residence
         You must assess the available evidence to support a FNO's  [foreign
         national offender's] claim of how  long  they  have  lived  in  the
         United Kingdom, and if they were exercising EEA Treaty  rights  for
         that period.  You may need to get additional  evidence  by  getting
         National Insurance records and other relevant sources.




         Factors for consideration
         Although considering Article 8 for most criminal cases was  brought
         within the scope of the Immigration Rules  (at  paragraphs  396  to
         400_ from 9 July 2012, the UK Immigration Rules do not apply to EEA
         nationals.

         You must consider any rights specified in the  European  Convention
         on Human Rights (ECHR) for the FNO and  their  family  members,  as
         well as the following individual factors:

            . Severity of offence
            . Length of sentence
            . Age
            . State of health
            . Length of United Kingdom residence
            . Strength of ties in the United Kingdom
            . Extent of links with the country of origin.

         Considering FNO cases in respect of Articles 3 and 8 (and  relevant
         case law) in particular, requires detailed analysis of the evidence
         available about their circumstances."

34. It is for this reason, no doubt, that the  respondent  has  a  procedure
   whereby she seeks a response to the stage  1  deportation  notice  before
   proceeding to make a deportation order.

35. The respondent's process for service on file is before me.  The  version
   provided was published on 20 January 2016: Mr Bates did not suggest  that
   the information therein was different in any relevant way from that which
   applied when the decision to serve to file was taken in this appeal:

         "Serving on file: process
         ...If you have conducted sufficient checks to try and establish the
         foreign national offender's whereabouts and these  have  failed  to
         locate them, it will be appropriate to propose  that  the  relevant
         decision notices be served on file.  Initial and  subsequent  stage
         deportation proposals must be agreed by the local  team  leader  or
         senior caseworker (deportation orders (DOs) must be signed  by  the
         director). ...

         Serving on file: conditions
         This section explains what must be done before deciding to serve  a
         decision on file, how such decisions will  be  validated,  and  the
         effect of serving to file on non-suspensive appeal certification.

         Checks
         You must  not  serve  deportation  decisions  on  file  unless  all
         reasonable attempts you have made to trace the individual and serve
         to the last  known  address  have  failed.   These  attempts  might
         include:
            . Writing to the person's last known address at least twice
            . Telephoning their last contact number at least twice
            .  Contacting  their  previous  representative  for  a  current
              address
         You must ensure these attempts are properly documented on both  CID
         and the Home Office file.

         Validity
         The relevant decision notices will be deemed  to  have  been  given
         when
            . A note is entered onto CID
            . A note is entered onto the Home Office file
            . The notices are signed

         Certification for non-suspensive appeal rights
         Where a decision is being served to file, you must not certify  the
         case under ...Regulation 24AA of the Immigration (EEA)  Regulations
         2006 in EEA cases, so that  there  is  a  non-suspensive  right  of
         appeal ..."

GCID records

36. Copies of the GCID record  sheets  are  provided,  following  a  Subject
   Access Request, but not those from the date  of  the  deportation  order.
   The notes before me begin on 10 January 2016,  after  the  appellant  had
   been refused boarding in Warsaw to return to Liverpool with his wife  and
   child.

         . On 10 January 2016, the notes record concern about where and how
           to serve the deportation order on the appellant,  since  he  had
           left the United Kingdom.

         . Also on 10 January 2016, an immigration officer in the  Criminal
           Casework  Prison  Operations  and  Enforcement  Team  noted   as
           follows:

             "CID notes indicate  that  subject  has  a  deportation  order
             signed against him based on his foreign  leg  [sic]  42  month
             robbery conviction. My concern is that the subject  has  never
             been aware of any adverse decision as the Stage 1 was returned
             'not called for and the Deportation Order was served  on  file
             (30/03/2015).   He  was  then  treated  as  an  absconder   on
             28/05/2015.  Because subject is an EEA  national  we  need  to
             know when he left the United Kingdom  and returned  to  Poland
             in order to know if the DO is even  valid.   It  would  appear
             that he was living at the address where the Stage 1  was  sent
             but just didn't pick it up.

             We spoke  briefly.   I  understand  that  it  is  a  waste  of
             resources to let subject come to the United Kingdom, serve the
             DO, and then return him to Poland, but nor does  it  make  any
             sense that the  Home  Office  would  be  allowed  to  serve  a
             Deportation Order electronically to another  country,  it  has
             always been my understanding that the DO should be  served  in
             person but obviously this could have changed.

             Hopefully one of my senior managers have their  Blackberry  on
             and can assist further."

         . On 12 January 2016, the notes  record  that  the  appellant  'is
           currently under a deportation order from March 2016 but this was
           NEVER entered onto the PNC (police  national  computer)  system.
           So I have entered a note onto PNC stating that he  is  currently
           subject to  the  March  2016  deportation  order  and  that  his
           whereabouts are believed to be in Poland'.

         . Also on 12 January 2016, the following note to the  case  worker
           on the appellant's case, from Admin Support Manager EEA  Command
           at the Home Office, was recorded at 10:44 hours:

                  "Your case ...was refused on a flight on 09/01/2016 to LPL
                  (Liverpool) because you have a DO signed in June [2015] in
                  printed docs, this FNO has  effectively  deported  himself
                  and we will now need to do post deport, however  I  notice
                  that not all the deportation events have been  updated  as
                  no DO signed is updated.  Could you  please  update  these
                  urgently  and  then  let  Admin  have  the  file   please.
                  Thanks."

Discussion

37. The  validity  of  the  deportation  decision  is  fundamental  to  this
   application for revocation.   I begin, therefore, by considering  whether
   the respondent  has  followed  the  correct  procedure  and  whether  her
   decision is in line with the EEA Regulations and her own policy.   If  it
   is not, then she has no defence to the appellant's  application  for  the
   revocation of that decision.

38. The respondent did not make proper attempts  to  serve  the  deportation
   order before serving to file.   She  made  only  one  postal  attempt  in
   relation to the Stage 1 letter, and none  for  the  deportation  decision
   itself.  The caseworker did not check with his solicitor to  see  whether
   any other address was known, nor did  she  note  the  conviction  on  the
   Police National Computer.  Had she accessed  that  computer,  the  Raikes
   Road address, where the  appellant  was  living  at  almost  all  of  the
   material times, would immediately have come to light  and  service  there
   would have given the appellant the opportunity to respond to the Stage  1
   notice, or to appeal or  challenge  the  deportation  order  by  judicial
   review.

39. It would also have brought to light the appellant's compliance with  the
   terms of his sentence, and any assessment made by  OASys  of  the  future
   risk he posed to the United Kingdom population.  None of this  was  taken
   into account.

40.  The  respondent's  decision  carries  a  Regulation  24AA  certificate,
   although the service to file policy states expressly that this  must  not
   be done.  The reason why the policy so states is obvious:  in  order  for
   the respondent to meet her international obligations under the ECHR,  she
   needs information about the appellant's private and family  life  in  the
   United Kingdom, and his personal conduct, including any change  in  those
   circumstances which makes commission of a further  offence  less  likely.
   In the present appeal, because the stage 1 notice received no reply,  the
   respondent had no information at all about the appellant's  circumstances
   in the  United  Kingdom  or  the  circumstances  underlying  the  battery
   offence.

41. My primary finding, therefore, is that the  deportation  order  was  not
   validly made and that the decision to serve  to  file  was  not  made  in
   accordance with the respondent's published policy.

42. It is not necessary to consider in detail what decision  the  respondent
   might have made, had she given the appellant an opportunity to argue  his
   human rights case.  It remains open to her, once he has been permitted to
   re-enter the United Kingdom, to serve him with the deportation order  and
   give him the opportunity of challenging  it  by  appeal,  making  further
   submissions, or seeking judicial review.  The appellant would  then  have
   available to him the opportunity of seeking to suspend the  execution  of
   the deportation order under Regulation 24AA until  such  challenges  were
   complete.

43. It may be, as the GCID notes observe, that this process of  readmission,
   service and an opportunity to challenge the  decision  is  expensive  and
   takes time.  That is a consequence of the respondent's  failure  to  make
   her decision properly in the first place and is  not  a  good  reason  to
   uphold the deportation order, which was neither validly made nor served.

DECISION

44. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

   The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error on  a
   point of law.

   I set aside the previous decision.

   I remake the decision by allowing  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the
   respondent's decision to refuse to revoke  a  deportation  order  against
   him.
