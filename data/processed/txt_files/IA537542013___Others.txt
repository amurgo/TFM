Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr S B Pannikkai, instructed by Law & Lawyers
                    Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of India born on 13th December  1977,  30th
    May 1976, 4th July 2000 and 13th July 2010.  The appellants  are  wife,
    husband and children and they made applications for indefinite leave to
    remain on 9th April 2013, the first appellant making an application  as
    a Tier  1  (General)  Migrant  and  the  remaining  appellants  as  her
    dependants.   In  a  refusal  letter  dated  29th  November  2013   the
    respondent refused the first appellant's  application  under  paragraph
    322(1A) and (2) of the Immigration Rules which state:

         "(1A)    Where  false  representations  have  been  made  or  false
                documents or information have been submitted (whether or not
                material to the application,  and  whether  or  not  to  the
                applicant's knowledge), or  material  facts  have  not  been
                disclosed, in relation to the application  or  in  order  to
                obtain documents from the Secretary  of  State  or  a  third
                party required in support of the application,

         ...

          (2) the making of false representations or the failure to disclose
                any material fact for the  purpose  of  obtaining  leave  to
                enter or a previous variation of leave or in order to obtain
                documents from the Secretary  of  State  or  a  third  party
                required in support of the application for leave to enter or
                a previous variation of leave

         ...

         the application must be refused."

 2. The application for the first appellant was  also  refused  further  to
    paragraph 245CD with reference to paragraph 39B(c) and paragraph  19(1)
    and 19(j) of Appendix A.

 3. In particular the respondent stated that the first appellant had  in  a
    previous application for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General)  Migrant
    submitted on 15th May 2011 claimed �21,145 as net profit from her self-
    employment as an educational consultant T/A Imatt Consultancy  for  the
    period 1st April 2010 to 31st March 2011.

 4. The Secretary of State had conducted further enquiries with HM  Revenue
    & Customs which reported that in the tax year 2010 to 2011 between 20th
    April 2010 to 5th April 2011 the appellant had reported a  turnover  of
    �42,130 and a net profit of �1,995 only.

 5. The Secretary of State was satisfied  that  the  declared  earnings  of
    �42,130 in the application submitted to the Secretary of State was  not
    consistent with the declarations made  to  HMRC  in  the  relevant  tax
    period.   Her  declared  earnings  for  a   similar   period   differed
    significantly and did not demonstrate that the declaration of  earnings
    to both the Home Office and HMRC was consistent.

 6. In the current application the appellant has claimed gross earnings  of
    �15,780 and a net profit of �11,398  with  Search  Engine  Optimisation
    from 9th July 2012 to 25th March 2013 and having  regard  to  the  fact
    that her previous declarations did not corroborate her earnings claimed
    the Secretary of  State  was  satisfied  she  had  also  made  a  false
    representation in her current application in order  to  facilitate  her
    indefinite leave to remain in the UK.

 7. The Secretary of State was satisfied that  the  appellant  had  made  a
    false representation in her May 2011 application  and  in  her  current
    application and therefore her application was refused  under  paragraph
    245CA (which stipulates that she must not be refused under the  general
    grounds of refusal) with reference to paragraph 322(1A) and (2).

 8. The appellant  appealed  on  the  basis  that  the  appellant  provided
    evidence from an accountant who was qualified as required by the  Rules
    and her income in her previous application was assessed  and  certified
    by  qualified  accountants.   Since  the  income   for   the   previous
    application was assessed and evaluated  by  qualified  accountants  the
    income was true on the date of the application (that is 15th May  2011)
    and therefore the application of  paragraph  322(1A)  and  (2)  of  the
    Immigration Rules was unwarranted.  Chiefly the appellant  should  have
    been  given  an  opportunity  to  explain  the  discrepancy  through  a
    qualified accountant before the invocation of paragraph 322.

 9.  The  appellant  contended  that  the  discrepancy  in  self-assessment
    declared after nearly a year did not render the actual income  declared
    before the Secretary of State as "disingenuous".

10. The appellant stated that neither the assessment of income  before  the
    Secretary of State nor the self-assessment tax return was done  by  her
    personally but through qualified professionals.

11. Judge Buckwell dismissed the appeal and an application  for  permission
    to appeal was made and granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Levin,  who
    stated that whilst the judge correctly stated that the burden of  proof
    was upon the respondent his failure to consider the issue of dishonesty
    and to make findings thereon arguably  amounted  to  an  error  of  law
    (Ahmed (general grounds of refusal - material non-disclosure)  Pakistan
    [2011] UKUT 351 (IAC)).

12. The grounds for the application for permission to  appeal  stated  that
    the appellant had been conducting  a  genuine  business  but  owing  to
    unfortunate circumstances she had shut her business down  with  losses.
    The business was closed in March 2012 and she was advised that  a  set-
    off was possible for the profits of previous years owing to the  losses
    in subsequent years.

13. She submitted that she should have been given an opportunity to explain
    the discrepancy and the discrepancy after nearly a year did not  render
    the  actual  income  declared  before  the  Secretary   of   State   as
    disingenuous.

14. The deception allegation was never  established  by  the  Secretary  of
    State and the burden of proof of dishonesty fell upon the Secretary  of
    State.

15. Further the discrepancy  was  such  that  the  appellant  submitted  an
    application on 5th April 2011 but the tax discrepancy arose in  January
    2012.  There had been a discounted tax payment owing to a future  loss.
    The appellant was acting in accordance with HMRC Rules and  paying  the
    discounted tax and this did  not  involve  deception.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal was unfair in insisting that the  appellant  had  not  adduced
    further documents to disprove the  allegation.   The  appellant  should
    have  been  given  an  opportunity  to  explain   the   alleged   false
    representation.

The Hearing

16. At the hearing before me Mr Pannikkai submitted that the  Secretary  of
    State had failed to establish a mens rea which  was  a  vital  test  in
    dishonesty.  There had been a revision of the appellant's account.  The
    first appellant accepted  that  the  figures  were  different  and  she
    accepted that the losses had occurred subsequent to April 2011 when the
    Immigration Rules changed.

17. It was conceded that the appellant had not referred the matter  to  the
    Home Office or written to them.  If in any doubt the genuineness of the
    application could be checked by the Secretary of State and had not done
    so.  No opportunity had been granted to  the  appellant  to  prove  her
    innocence.  She suffered losses following the change to the Immigration
    Rules.  The Secretary of State should be slow to establish  dishonesty.
    The burden of proof is on the respondent.  She had  money  refunded  in
    the following tax year.  The appellant had not been dishonest and  this
    was how accountancy  worked,  the  tax  was  assessed  later,  and  the
    Secretary of State had not discharged the burden to draw an explanation
    from the appellant.  She had a provisional audit in 2011  and  a  final
    audit in January 2012.

18. Mr Melvin submitted that the  appellant  had  nine  months  to  produce
    evidence at the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  and  she
    did not do so.  The accountants could have  made  representations  when
    the figures  changed  and  this  did  not  occur.   There  was  a  huge
    discrepancy in the figures and the appellant has had ample  opportunity
    to give the reasons from a professional accountancy firm  and  she  had
    not done so.

Conclusions

19. I note from the application form  made  on  8th  March  2013  that  the
    appellant has given a signed declaration to state that:

         "I confirm that if before this application is decided  there  is  a
         material change in my circumstances or new information relevant  to
         his application becomes available I will inform UKBA."

20. No such representations had been made to the UKBA but  at  the  hearing
    before  Judge  Buckwell  and  as  recorded  at  paragraph  20  of   his
    determination  the  appellant  confirmed  that  the  respective  profit
    figures in the sums quoted by the Secretary of State in the  letter  of
    refusal were in fact correct.  The  judge  recorded  that  the  figures
    differed because she had been advised that she could offset her  losses
    against her other income from profits.

21. As recorded by the judge at paragraph 21 of the determination the judge
    wrote:

         "21. The First Appellant was asked why a figure given to  the  Home
             Office had been �20,145 but a lower figure of �1,995 had  been
             given to HMRC.  Asked to explain the difference in the figures
             the First Appellant referred to massive  financial  losses  in
             her business.  She then said that she had made  profit  amount
             to �20,145.

         22.  Asked about refunds of immigration application fees the  First
             Appellant said that they had related  to  admission  fees  for
             colleges.  Some colleges had paid refunds to students but some
             had also charged an administration fee.  Against profits there
             was an off-set of outstanding sums.  The First Appellant  said
             that HMRC had accepted a profit figure of �1,995.   Thereafter
             the business was closed."

22. The judge clearly set out at paragraph 31 that the burden with  respect
    to paragraph 322 of the Immigration Rules shifted to the respondent.

23. In paragraph 32 the judge correctly cites that paragraph 322(2)  refers
    to the making of false representations which  may  concern  a  previous
    variation of leave application.

24. The judge confirmed at paragraph 37 that he did not have concerns about
    the  most  recent  documents  but  having  recorded   the   significant
    discrepancy between the figures put in by the  appellant  to  the  Home
    Office and the  figures  put  in  to  the  HMRC,  which  the  appellant
    accepted, the judge then stated:

         "There has been seemingly no attempt to rebut the  assertions  made
         by or on behalf of the respondent in justifying the application  of
         paragraph 322 grounds."

    Having  acknowledged  the  fact  that  the   appellant   had   put   in
    significantly varying figures as the appellant accepted the judge  then
    went on to state:

         "There is a total paucity of evidence relating  to  any  reasonable
         explanation for the discrepancies and differences  in  the  figures
         put forward by the first appellant to the Home Office or  to  HMRC.
         There is a stark contrast between the  absence  of  information  in
         that regard and the detailed information  and  evidence  which  has
         been put before the  Tribunal  with  respect  to  the  more  recent
         employment and earnings of the first appellant."  [38]

25. As the judge goes on to state at [39] the appeal  process  allowed  the
    individual appellant to be able to respond to the assertions and having
    accepted the condition precedent that there was  a  marked  discrepancy
    between the figures given to the Home Office and the HMRC and the  fact
    that the respondent's views were clearly set out the judge  would  have
    expected the first appellant to have provided further information and

         "confirmation by an accountancy firm or  practice  to  explain  the
         discrepancies.  The discrepancies were such that they  required  an
         explanation.  I find that no suitable explanation was provided."

26. From this paragraph I conclude that the judge was  not  satisfied  that
    the appellant had been acting honestly and although he  has  not  spelt
    this out specifically I find that  his  reasoning  and  explanation  is
    adequate.  Indeed he goes on at paragraph 41 to state:

         "Specifically no professional evidence was adduced to  support  the
         claim by the First Appellant that she  was  entitled  to  represent
         profit figures differently because  she  was  permitted  to  offset
         financial  losses  from  her  previous  business  in  one  or  more
         subsequent financial  years.   The  absence  of  that  evidence  is
         critical."

27. I would agree.  It is not for the respondent  having  established  that
    varying figures had been submitted and having notified the appellant of
    the issue taken with her previous application that there was an onus on
    the respondent to demand further explanation.  I  can  accept  that  AA
    (Nigeria) [2010] EWCA Civ 773 is clear that dishonesty is required  but
    there was no evidence before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  to  the
    effect that the appellant was able to  offset  later  losses  from  her
    profit figure given to the HMRC.  Further she would have known  by  May
    2011 when the application was submitted of the figures in  relation  to
    the accounting period 2010 to 2011 even though tax returns are made  at
    a later date.

28. Even if the judge should have set it out more clearly, which I  do  not
    find he could, a document submitted to me from  Jomy  John  McCom  ACA,
    Johns Accountancy & Taxation and which was undated stated:

         "Further as the client is an individual, tax law is not  permitting
         to carry back the loss in 2011/2012 against  profit  in  2010/2011.
         It is possible in the case of a limited company."

    I therefore do not accept the appellant's contention that a  loss  that
    she accepts that she suffered in 2011 to 2012  could  be  backdated  to
    reflect the profit submitted in 2010/2011 and those profits she knew as
    at the date of application.

29. I therefore find no error in the determination of  Judge  Buckwell  and
    the determination shall stand.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
