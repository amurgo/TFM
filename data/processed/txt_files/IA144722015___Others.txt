For the Appellants:    Mr B Hawkin (Counsel)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    J L Bristow, promulgated on 28th March 2018, following a hearing at the
    Birmingham Civil Justice Centre on Thursday 15th March  2018.   In  the
    determination, the judge allowed the appeal of the Appellant, whereupon
    the Respondent Secretary of State, subsequently applied  for,  and  was
    granted, permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  thus  the
    matter comes before me.

The Appellants

 2. The Appellants are Indian nationals.  The first Appellant is  the  wife
    of the second Appellant.  She was born on 23rd August 1985.  The second
    Appellant is her husband and he was born on 2nd May  1976.   The  third
    Appellant is their child, a daughter, and she was born on 16th February
    2005.  She is currently 13 years of age.

The Appellants' Claim

 3. The Appellants' claim is that they came to the UK on a  visitor's  visa
    in August 2009 and have remained here ever since.   Further  grants  of
    leave were made.  On 14th March 2013 the first Appellant applied for  a
    Tier 2 (General) visa and this was accompanied by supporting  documents
    and two letters dated 4th March 2013 purporting to be from Teleca  Ltd,
    and offering the first Appellant employment as  a  quality  controller.
    It is a feature of this appeal that both these letters were false.   On
    17th October 2013 the first Appellant applied for a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student visa and the second  and  third  Appellants  were  included  as
    dependants on that application.  The application of 14th March 2013 was
    not decided by the time of 17th October 2017.  The initial  application
    was subsequently amended on the basis that the first  Appellant  wished
    to undertake further studies in the UK and therefore what had  happened
    was  that  she  had  her  grounds  of  application  by  submitting   an
    application for a variation.  The Respondent refused the  17th  October
    2013 application on 27th  March  2015  and  did  so  on  the  basis  of
    paragraph 322(1A) of the Immigration Rules  that  false  documents  had
    been submitted.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge, in what was a clearly crafted and structured  determination,
    set out the relevant questions to be determined by him under  the  law,
    and went on to conclude that this was a case where, false documents had
    been submitted by a Mr Rakesh Patel, whom the first Appellant had  paid
    ï¿½5,000, but that she herself was not aware of the submission  of  false
    documents (paragraph 57).  Given the presence of a child of  the  first
    and second Appellants, regard was given to  paragraph  276ADE  in  this
    context.

 5. The judge noted that there were a number of reasons  why  it  would  be
    entirely reasonable for the Appellants to return back to India together
    with the third Appellant, their child, because the third Appellant

         "will be leaving with her parents and generally in the child's best
         interests to remain with their parents; schooling will be available
         in India; and a private life has been  established  during  a  time
         when her immigration status was precarious" (paragraph 34).

    The judge also, however, considered that there were a number of reasons
    why it would not be reasonable for the third  Appellant  to  return  to
    India and these included the fact that,

         "she has been in the UK for nearly nine years; she came to  the  UK
         when she was 4; her formative years were spent in the  UK;  she  is
         doing well at school here; she is about to select her GCSE options;
         she does not understand the local language in  India;  the  English
         schools in India are around 50 kilometres in relation to her  home;
         and she has close relationship with friends and family in  the  UK"
         (paragraph 35).

 6. On this basis, the judge concluded that "the third Appellant meets  the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv)" and  that  in  "balancing  the
    competing factors together, it will not be  reasonable  to  expect  the
    third Appellant to leave the UK" (see paragraphs 36 to 37).

 7. The judge then went on to consider whether the decision reached by  the
    Secretary of State was proportionate (see paragraphs 45  to  48).   The
    judge in the end concluded that the decision will  be  disproportionate
    in its interference with the right to respect the private lives of  the
    Appellants, and gave ten specific reasons for this (at paragraph 49).

 8. The appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

 9. The grounds of application state that the  judge  failed  to  apply  AA
    (Nigeria) [2010] EWCA Civ 733 in that it was clear that in cases  where
    there had been a submission of a "false document"  the  legal  position
    was that

         "the mere fact that a dishonest document has been used for such  an
         important application is understandably a sufficient reason  for  a
         mandatory refusal.  That is why the rule expressly emphasises  that
         it applies 'whether or not to the applicant's knowledge'."

10. Secondly, the grounds allege that the decision by  the  judge,  in  his
    application of paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) was  one  that  was  "manifestly
    wrong  in  law"  in  that  it  failed  to  treat  the   assessment   of
    reasonableness as a proportionality exercise which  included  also  the
    elements of immigration history of the parents.




11. Finally, that the judge engaged in a material error  in  importing  the
    unlawful finding about the child's qualification for limited  leave  to
    remain into the assessment of proportionality outside  the  Immigration
    Rules (at paragraph 49).

12. On 4th July 2018 permission to appeal was granted on the basis that the
    judge had arguably failed to follow the approach in AA [2010] EWCA  Civ
    773 and  that  had  failed  to  take  into  account  all  the  relevant
    circumstances.

Submissions

13. At the hearing before me on 14th November 2018, Ms Aboni, appearing  on
    behalf of the Respondent submitted that she would rely upon the grounds
    of application and that this was a case where the judge had  failed  to
    properly follow the strictures in AA (Nigeria)  [2010]  EWCA  Civ  773.
    Whilst the first  Appellant  may  have  given  evidence  that  she  was
    innocent of any fraudulent activity on the part of her agent,  she  was
    an educated woman, and must have realised  that  false  documents  were
    being used on her behalf, and the judge failed to  properly  take  into
    account this dishonesty.

14. For his part, Mr Hawkin relied upon his Rule 24 response, together with
    the recent Supreme Court judgment in KO (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC  53.   He
    made the following three submissions.   First,  as  far  as  the  first
    Ground of Appeal was concerned this was nothing to the point.  What had
    been said in the first ground (at paragraph 27) was that the judge  had
    erred (at paragraph 27)  in  failing  to  heed  the  strictures  of  AA
    (Nigeria) and recognising that the mere fact that a dishonest  document
    has been used is a sufficient  reason  for  a  mandatory  refusal.   Mr
    Hawkin submitted that this was simply not correct because the judge had
    expressly noted that the submission of such documents did  provide  the
    Secretary of State with grounds for a mandatory refusal and this was so
    "whether or not to the applicant's knowledge".  However, what the judge
    had then gone on to say (at paragraph 27), was that the  Appellant  did
    not know that the documents were false.

15. Second, the suggestion that the judge's approach to reasonableness  was
    "also manifestly wrong in law" was equally untenable because the  judge
    had set out all of the reasons for why the return  of  the  Appellants,
    together with the third Appellant, to India would  be  reasonable  (see
    paragraph 34).  He had then gone on to also explain  it  would  not  be
    reasonable (at paragraph 34).  Having compared  the  various  different
    considerations, he had then concluded  that  "balancing  the  competing
    factors together, it would  not  be  reasonable  to  expect  the  third
    Appellant to leave the UK" (paragraph 36).  In this, the judge had  not
    departed from the latest Supreme Court judgment in KO  (Nigeria)  where
    it had been recognised that "it will normally  be  reasonable  for  the
    child to be with them" where the parents have no right to remain in the
    UK and that "to that extent  the  record  of  the  parents  may  become
    indirectly material" (paragraph 18).  The  judge  had  recognised  that
    this was the case.

16. However, he had then gone on to conclude that notwithstanding this, for
    the reasons that he had set out (at paragraph 35) in the case  of  this
    particular child who had been here for nearly nine years,  having  come
    to this country at the age of 4, her formative years were spent in this
    country and that it will not be reasonable  to  expect  her  to  go  to
    India.  This was a conclusion  that  the  fact-finding  Tribunal  alone
    could properly make.  There was no error in this.

17. Finally, the judge had expressly looked at  the  disproportionality  of
    the decision and for  the  ten  reasons  given  in  paragraph  49,  had
    concluded  that  the  decision  of   the   Secretary   of   State   was
    unsustainable.  The judge had taken as his starting point the status of
    the parents in this country, and the fact that they  had  no  right  to
    remain here, and that was the correct approach to take.  The judge  had
    also taken into account the Section 117B considerations, and  that  too
    was correctly taken into account.  There was no error.

No Error of Law

18. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    the TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision and remake the
    decision.  My reasons are those that have been given by Mr Hawkin.

19. This is a case where the judge carefully and in  a  structured  fashion
    sets out the relevant considerations, recognising that there was  false
    documentation presented on  the  Appellants'  behalf,  which  made  the
    application invalid and one that stood to be rejected on the  basis  of
    paragraph 322(1A).  However, subsequently going on to consider  whether
    the first Appellant was aware that the documents were false, the  judge
    concluded that she did not know this to be the case (paragraph 27), and
    proceeded even to conclude that the Appellants could not succeed  under
    a partner route under Appendix FM and could not  succeed  also  on  the
    basis that they had been in this country for twenty years.   The  judge
    had also stated that there were a number of reasons why the removal  of
    all the Appellants would be reasonable (paragraph 34).

20. However, when considering the issue of proportionality  the  judge  had
    concluded that it will not be reasonable for  the  third  Appellant  in
    particular to return back to India after being in this country for nine
    years (paragraph 35), in circumstances where she was  about  to  select
    her GCSE options and had been  doing  quite  well  at  school  in  this
    country (paragraph 35).  In this respect only, the judge had  concluded
    that  the  third  Appellant   met   the   requirements   of   paragraph
    276ADE(1)(iv).

21. Thereafter, the judge had gone on to say that  the  number  of  factors
    favoured a finding in favour of  the  Appellants  that  there  will  be
    disproportionate interference with  the  right  to  respect  for  their
    private lives in this country (paragraph 49) and these  were  set  out.
    The decision was one that was open to the judge  to  make  as  a  fact-
    finding Tribunal and there is no error of law.
