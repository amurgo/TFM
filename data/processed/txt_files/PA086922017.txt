For the claimant: No attendance or representation
For the appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Clark promulgated 24.10.18, allowing on  article  3
    grounds the claimant's appeal against the decisions of the Secretary of
    State to refuse his humanitarian protection and  human  rights  claims,
    and to deport him from the UK.





Relevant Background and Immigration History

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Somalia, with date of birth of 6.6.75.  He
    was raised in Mogadishu with his parents and seven siblings, members of
    the minority Madhibaan clan. It was alleged that  the  dominant  Hawiye
    clan caused problems for the family and that in 1991  the  USC  militia
    shot and killed the claimant's brother and cousin, and raped one of his
    sisters. He entered the UK in March 1993 at the age of 17  fleeing  the
    civil war in Somali. His protection claim was refused but in line  with
    his sister he was granted exceptional leave  to  remain  on  successive
    occasions until he was granted Indefinite  Leave  to  Remain  in  March
    2001.

 3. In October 2009, following his conviction for arson, he  was  sentenced
    to 6 years'  imprisonment.  A  previous  conviction  in  2005  was  for
    criminal damage. Subsequently, in  August  2015  he  was  convicted  of
    affray and racially aggravated threatening, abusive or insulting  words
    or behaviour and sentenced to 24 months' imprisonment. He continued  in
    immigration detention until released on bail in November 2017.

The Relevant Appeal History

 4. In August 2006, the Secretary of State made a deportation order and his
    protection and human rights claims were refused and certified under s72
    and paragraph 339D of the Rules respectively in June 2012.  On  24.8.17
    his protection and human rights  claims  were  again  refused.  It  was
    against this last decision that the claimant appealed to the First-tier
    Tribunal. Judge Clark allowed the appeal on the basis  that  to  return
    the claimant to Mogadishu would  be  in  breach  of  his  rights  under
    articles 2 and 3 ECHR.

 5. Relying on MOJ and others (Somalia) CG [2014] UKUT 00442, (Somalia CG),
    the Secretary of State  challenged  the  decision,  in  particular  the
    judge's conclusions on return to Mogadishu in the claimant's favour. In
    summary, the judge accepted  the  evidence  of  the  claimant  and  his
    witnesses that there were no family ties in Mogadishu to which he could
    turn for assistance. Considerable reliance was placed by the  judge  on
    the 2017 report of Mary Harper as to difficulties  the  claimant  would
    allegedly face on the bases of his Madhibaan clan membership,  said  to
    be a particularly despised minority group,  which  it  was  said  would
    limit his  access  to  clan  support  in  obtaining  accommodation  and
    employment. The judge also accepted Ms Harper's  opinion  that  if  the
    claimant's atheistic beliefs became known in Mogadishu, he would be  at
    substantial risk of being killed.  Ms  Harper  also  asserted  that  Al
    Shabaab remained a threat to the claimant in Mogadishu.

 6. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Foudy  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    13.11.18, on the  basis  that  it  was  arguable  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had erred in the approach to the expert witness and failed  to
    apply the Country Guidance of MOJ as to risk on return.

 7. The matter then came before the Upper  Tribunal  panel  comprising  Mrs
    Justice Farley and Upper Tribunal Judge King, whose decision of 13.3.19
    found error of law in the failure of the First-tier Tribunal to  engage
    with MOJ in relation to  the  risk  on  return  to  Mogadishu  from  Al
    Shabaab, his clan membership, and his atheism. The panel noted that  Ms
    Harper's opinions on these  issues  have  been  the  subject  of  heavy
    criticism in AAW (Expert evidence -  weight)  [2015]  UKUT  673  (IAC),
    where they were found to be factually unsupported and inconsistent with
    MOJ. The panel set the decision aside,  indicating  that  it  would  be
    remade in  the  Upper  Tribunal  "with  a  particular  focus  upon  the
    circumstances to be faced by the claimant upon return and whether  they
    engage Articles 3 or present very significant obstacles to return so as
    to engage article 8." The panel also noted at [38] that there had  been
    no challenge to the credibility of the claimant or  his  witnesses  and
    noted that, "for the most part there has been a reliance upon  judicial
    authority and expert  reports,  focused  on  the  issue  of  safety  of
    return." No findings were preserved but the panel  saw  "little  reason
    why evidence that was presented before the tribunal  as  noted  in  the
    determination could not be adopted in a subsequent decision."

 8. Following a transfer order the matter came before  me  sitting  in  the
    Upper Tribunal on 26.4.19.At the outset of that hearing,  Mr  MacKenzie
    renewed the application for adjournment which  had  been  made  in  the
    representative's letter of 23.4.19 and refused by the Upper Tribunal on
    the basis that there was no explanation as to why the  application  had
    not been made earlier and the view that there was  sufficient  evidence
    before the tribunal in the public domain by way of country reports  and
    the current country guidance, as well as the evidence of the  claimant,
    to allow a just determination of the issues arising. I noted  from  the
    letter of 23.4.19 that the claimant's representatives sought to  obtain
    further country expert evidence, perhaps to address the criticisms made
    of  Ms  Harper.  However,  Mr  MacKenzie's  renewed   application   for
    adjournment was made on a rather different basis, that there needed  to
    be up to date medical evidence as to the claimant's mental  health  and
    his vulnerability on return. Whilst the report of Dr  Thomas  is  dated
    2018, is based on a now rather dated assessment from 2017.

 9. For the  Secretary  of  State,  Mr  Jarvis  supported  the  adjournment
    request, also noting that the medical evidence was  dated,  and  fairly
    indicating that he intended to rely on the absence of absence of any up
    to date mental health evidence preventing or inhibiting the  claimant's
    integration on return. I was not impressed by the  additional  argument
    of Mr MacKenzie that because the claimant had been awarded some �67,500
    in damages that medical evidence was needed as to his ability to handle
    that money and avoid  exploitation  on  return.  However,  I  was  just
    persuaded that up to date mental health evidence was  relevant  to  the
    circumstances of the claimant's return and his ability to  survive  and
    integrate in Mogadishu. Given that Mr Jarvis would have relied  on  the
    absence of such evidence adds weight to the  probative  value  of  such
    evidence.

10. In the circumstances and somewhat reluctantly, given the length of time
    the resolution of this appeal  has  been  outstanding,  I  granted  the
    adjournment request, making absolutely clear that the  adjournment  was
    solely for the purpose of obtaining a further or addendum  report  from
    Dr Thomas and not a licence  to  reformulate  the  claimant's  case  by
    further country expert  evidence.  In  that  regard,  I  note  that  in
    preliminary discussions, Mr MacKenzie indicated that in  light  of  the
    findings preserved and the views of the Upper Tribunal  panel,  he  did
    not anticipate there would need to be any  further  oral  evidence  and
    that the appeal would proceed by way of the  written  report(s)  of  Dr
    Thomas  and  the   existing   documentary   evidence,   together   with
    submissions. He did  not  pursue  the  adjournment  request  to  obtain
    further expert evidence  from  Ms  Harper,  heavily  criticised  in  Mr
    Jarvis' skeleton argument.

11. For clarity, Mr MacKenzie also accepted  that  the  arguments  formerly
    advanced on Al Shabaab, Atheism, or  clan  membership  were  no  longer
    viable and confirmed that the remaining issues turn on  the  claimant's
    personal and mental health circumstances on return to Mogadishu and the
    article 3  risk,  or  alternatively  the  article  8  very  significant
    obstacles argument issue.

The Continuation Hearing

12. The appeal came back before me for remaking  on  8.7.19.  However,  not
    only has the claimant failed to serve any additional medical  evidence,
    but there was no attendance  by  or  on  behalf  of  the  claimant.  No
    correspondence has been  received  from  his  representatives.  In  the
    circumstances, the interpreter was released.

13. Mr Jarvis informed  me  that  he  had  the  previous  week  chased  the
    solicitors for the outstanding medical report only to be told that they
    no longer acted for the claimant. Information was  also  provided  that
    the claimant has  been  arrested  on  a  number  of  occasions  in  the
    intervening period, latterly in June 2019.  Mr  Jarvis  was  unable  to
    assist with the outcome or the claimant's whereabouts. It may  be  that
    he is effectively absent without leave.

14. In the circumstances, and being satisfied that  the  claimant  and  his
    legal representatives were properly notified of  the  hearing  date,  I
    concluded that it was just and proper to proceed with the  remaking  of
    the appeal decision in the claimant's absence.  Mr  Jarvis  made  brief
    submissions in line with his previously submitted skeleton argument and
    I reserved the decision.

15. For the reasons summarised below, I have dismissed the  appeal  on  all
    grounds.

Relevant Findings of Fact

16. From the First-tier Tribunal decision I adopt the following findings of
    fact as consistent with the error of law decision:

      a) For the reasons set out in the decision,  the  claimant  failed  to
         rebut the presumption in s72 of the 2002  Act  that  he  remains  a
         danger to the community. I also note that for  similar  reasons  he
         has  been  excluded  from  humanitarian  protection   pursuant   to
         paragraph 339D of the Immigration Rules on the basis that there are
         serious reasons for considering that he  has  committed  a  serious
         crime. It follows that the only live ground of appeal available and
         relied on is human rights pursuant to articles 2, 3 or 8 ECHR;

      b) There is no  article  15(c)  risk  of  indiscriminate  violence  in
         Mogadishu and the country  background  information  relied  by  the
         claimant does not provide clear and cogent evidence of a change  of
         circumstances since the Somalia CG decision of 2014;

      c) There is no real risk of serious harm from Al Shabaab on return  to
         Mogadishu;

      d) The  claimant  has  consistently  maintained  that  he  is  a  non-
         proselytising atheist and open about his consumption of alcohol. He
         has a history of alcohol and drug misuse but is not  receiving  any
         formal or informal medical or other support for substance misuse;

      e) He came to the UK at  age  17,  funded  by  his  parents  both  now
         deceased;

      f) He is a member of the minority Madhibaan clan, which may limit  his
         access to clan support for accommodation and employment;

      g) He has mental  health  issues.  Dr  Thomas  concluded  that  he  is
         suffering  from  significant  symptoms  of   psychiatric   disorder
         (moderate to  severe  major  depressive  disorder  with  additional
         traits  of   borderline   personality   or   emotionally   unstable
         personality disorder) consequent on the experience of  cumulatively
         traumatic life events including, mental and physical abuse from his
         father and witnessing dead bodies and people being shot during  the
         civil war. She stated, "if  returned  to  Somalia  in  his  current
         psychiatric condition, as a vulnerable  adult  with  a  history  of
         reported   abuse   and   trauma   which   appears   psychiatrically
         credible/consistent and significant psychiatric  disorder,  I  also
         consider that (the claimant) will also  be  vulnerable  to  further
         abuse and/or exploitation and that his ability to  seek  protection
         in response to any threats or risk will be highly impoverished  due
         to his considerable lack of trust in Somali authority  figures  and
         his degree of psychiatric illness and  traumatisation."  The  judge
         accepted  that  returning  him  to  Somalia   may   cause   intense
         retraumatisation and self-destructive behaviours, of which he has a
         history.  He  was  said  to  be  in  need   of   sustained   period
         psychological treatment as well as NHS  drug  and  alcohol  support
         services.  With  treatment  he  would  recover  within  2-3  years.
         However, the report is rather old and there is no evidence that  he
         is on any medication or that he has sought or  received  the  other
         treatment recommended and has certainly had  no  counselling  since
         2017;

      h) Despite his mental health difficulties, the claimant stated that he
         is willing to work but has not worked in the UK since  2008,  apart
         from in prison. However, he worked in the restaurant  industry  and
         as a forklift truck driver for 6 years;

      i) He has a sister in the UK but no family contact in  Somalia,  being
         estranged from cousins there, so that he  can  count  on  no  local
         family support on return. His sister Layla does  what  she  can  to
         support him in the UK, allowing him to stay with her on a temporary
         basis but as she is a single mother in a one-bedroom flat she would
         be unable to provide financial assistance to him in Somalia;

      j) He has two children in the UK but is estranged  from  their  mother
         since their separation in 2008 and  he  has  no  contact  with  the
         children.

17. It is not necessary for me to address the s72 and 339D exclusions  from
    asylum and humanitarian protection as the First-tier Tribunal found the
    claimant failed to rebut the presumptions.

18. It is not necessary for me to address in any details the issues of clan
    membership, atheism, or risk from Al Shabaab on  return  to  Mogadishu.
    These claims were specifically abandoned on the  claimant's  behalf  at
    the last hearing and, in light of the criticism of her evidence in  the
    error of law decision,  Mr  Mackenzie  was  no  longer  relying  on  Dr
    Harper's report or that of Dr Aguilar as to the  safety  on  return  of
    Mogadishu. As explained in the error of law decision,  the  Somalia  CG
    held that the evidence does not  establish  that  'ordinary  civilians'
    including diaspora returnees are targeted by anyone, including  on  the
    basis of minority clan membership, including by  Al  Shabaab,  and  the
    judge was found to be in error to prefer the evidence of Ms  Harper  to
    the country guidance. As stated above, there is no article  15(c)  risk
    and the Al Shabaab withdrawal from Mogadishu is complete. It  has  also
    been pointed out in the Somalia CG  that  there  have  been  remarkable
    changes in Somalia with an economic boom  and  there  was  no  reliable
    evidence that the Madhibaan people would be  disadvantaged  in  finding
    accommodation or employment. In fact, returnees from the diaspora  have
    a greater chance of finding work than those in the native population.

19. The judge found that on return the claimant would  have  no  access  to
    financial resources and no  possibility  of  remittances  from  abroad.
    However, I take account of  the  fact  that  he  has  received  a  very
    significant sum in compensation approaching �70,000, which obviates the
    need for any remittances or financial assistance on return. He is  also
    entitled to the enforced returns financial package of �750. With such a
    sum he can find accommodation and live comfortably  for  a  significant
    period and,  if  necessary,  pay  for  any  medical  or  mental  health
    treatment he is in need of. With such a sum he will not  need  to  find
    employment and there will be no urgency in him doing so, at  least  for
    some years. It follows that there is no real risk of the claimant being
    destitute or being forced to live in an IDP camp.

20. It was previously argued on the claimant's behalf that with his  mental
    health difficulties he would find challenges in managing his money  and
    would be vulnerable to exploitation. Given the  limited  mental  health
    evidence and the absence of any updated evidence I have to  proceed  on
    the basis that there has been no further medical report of any kind and
    that the claimant is not currently  in  receipt  of  any  treatment  or
    medication, nor has he been since at least  2017.  An  adjournment  was
    granted for the purpose of obtaining updated mental health evidence but
    none has been forthcoming and there is very little before the  tribunal
    relevant to his present ability to survive and integrate in  Mogadishu.
    I take the  claimant's  case  on  this  issue  at  the  highest  I  can
    consistent with the limitations of the evidence and in particular  take
    account of and do not underestimate a potential traumatising effect  on
    being returned to Mogadishu given  his  experiences  and  treatment.  I
    accept that this may make integration the  more  difficult,  especially
    when he has no family there to turn to.

21. I also bear in mind that the Somalia  CG  suggested  at  (xii)  of  the
    Guidance that "relocation in Mogadishu for a person of a minority  clan
    with no former links to the city, no access to funds and no other  form
    of clan, family or social support is unlikely to be  realistic  as,  in
    the absence of means to establish a  home  and  some  form  of  ongoing
    financial support there will be a real risk of  having  no  alternative
    but to live in makeshift accommodation within an IDP camp  where  there
    is a real possibility of having to live in conditions  that  will  fall
    below acceptable humanitarian standards." However, as explained  below,
    subsequent and binding jurisprudence casts doubt as to what issue  this
    part of the Country Guidance relates.

22. As the Court of Appeal held  in  Said  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  442,  a  case
    involving a claimant with similar mental health issues (though I accept
    that each case must turn on its  own  facts),  whether  or  not  feared
    deprivation is contributed to by a mental condition, the person  liable
    to deportation must show circumstances which bring him within the N and
    D threshold cases. The argument was that his mental health issues  will
    make it difficult for him to integrate in Somalia and have an impact on
    the ability to  find  work  and  survive  economically.  However,  that
    claimant could expect financial support and  there  was  no  suggestion
    that he would be unable to receive the relatively  commonplace  medical
    treatment he enjoyed in the UK on return to  Mogadishu.  The  Court  of
    Appeal rejected the argument that  a  finding  that  a  returnee  might
    through economic deprivation end up in an IDP camp  was  sufficient  to
    cross the article 3 threshold. The  Court  of  Appeal  considered  that
    paragraph 407(h) of  the  Somali  CG  could  only  relate  to  internal
    relocation and does not "chime" with article 15(b) which has been  held
    to equate to article 3 ECHR,  as  the  fact  that  a  person  might  be
    returned to very deprived living conditions, could not (save in extreme
    cases) lead to a conclusion that removal would violate article 3, which
    has to meet the approach in N and D. The Court of Appeal suggested that
    the  Upper  Tribunal  in  the  Somali  CG  had  conflated   "acceptable
    humanitarian standards" with article 3 and this  part  of  the  country
    guidance was inconsistent with Strasbourg jurisprudence. The  situation
    might be different where the risk arises  through  conflict  or  direct
    violence  itself,  or  the  conditions  are  imposed  or   the   direct
    responsibility or the direct act of the state of return.

23. The point was more recently put more starkly by Lady Justice  Arden  in
    MA (Somalia) [2018] EWCA Civ 994, where the Court of Appeal  held  that
    there is no violation of Article 3 by reason only  of  the  absence  of
    humanitarian living standards on return. "Article  3  is  not  normally
    violated by sending a refugee back to his country of origin where there
    is a risk that his  living  conditions  will  fall  below  humanitarian
    standards."

24. On the limited evidence in this case, I find that the claimant fails to
    establish that by reason of his circumstances including  the  state  of
    his mental health and the risk of traumatisation by his return that his
    return to Mogadishu would be a breach of articles 2 or 3. There  is  no
    reason why, if he needs it, he cannot obtain mental health treatment on
    return. The respondent has pointed to  primary  medical  facilities  in
    Mogadishu, should assistance be  needed.  Even  if  he  has  no  family
    connections there and cannot count on financial support from family  in
    the UK or elsewhere,  he  has  access  to  very  substantial  financial
    support from his own funds which will be more  than  enough  to  obtain
    accommodation without needing to enter an IDP camp.  He  will  also  be
    able to seek work, which he claims  he  wishes  to  do.  However,  even
    without work his financial means are more than sufficient to  keep  him
    for several years to come, given the evidence that simple housing costs
    between $40-80 per month. Further, it is very difficult to  see  how  a
    person with accepted mental health issues who has not sought or receive
    medication or other treatment for mental health issues for  some  years
    and with no contemporary  medical  evidence  can  demonstrate  that  to
    return him will reach the very high threshold of  N  and  D.   Even  if
    return  is  traumatising  and  there  is  a  risk   of   vulnerability,
    exploitation, return  to  drug  and  alcohol  misuse,  or  self-harming
    behaviours, I find that these factors individually or  taken  together,
    along with his other personal circumstances, fall far short of reaching
    the article 3 threshold.

Article 8 Considerations

25. Neither in my opinion are the claimant's  circumstances  sufficient  to
    demonstrate very significant obstacles  to  integration  sufficient  to
    justify granting him leave to  remain  on  article  8  grounds,  either
    within or without the Rules. I have to bear in mind that because of his
    sentence of over 4 years imprisonment he is statutorily prohibited from
    the exceptions to deportation in s117C(4),  because  s117C(6)  provides
    that the public interest requires the  deportation  of  such  a  person
    unless  there  are  very  compelling  circumstances  over   and   above
    Exceptions 1 and 2. In considering those exceptions, he may be able  to
    show lawful residence for most of his life, but his  criminal  history,
    including before and after the index offence, demonstrates that  he  is
    not socially and culturally integrated in the UK. Neither do  I  accept
    that  with  the  monies  available  to  him,  despite   mental   health
    difficulties, that there would be very  significant  obstacles  to  his
    integration. He is not currently in receipt of any  medical  treatment,
    claims to no longer abuse alcohol or drugs, and there is no real reason
    why he cannot seek employment, should he so  wish.  Similar  provisions
    arise and apply under paragraphs 398 to 399A of the Immigration Rules.

26. On the facts of this case, I am not satisfied  that  the  claimant  can
    demonstrate that he has any family relationship the effect on which his
    deportation would be unduly harsh. He has no contact  with  any  family
    members other than his sister. It is not claimed that there is anything
    more than the normal emotional ties between such adult relatives.

27. In any event, he has to show very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
    above those exceptions. On  the  evidence  and  taking  the  claimant's
    circumstances at the highest consistent with the limited evidence,  and
    for the reasons elaborated above, I find that he falls very  far  short
    of that threshold.

28. In any event, in any  proportionality  balancing  exercise  the  public
    interest consideration has to take account  that  the  public  interest
    requires the deportation of a foreign criminal. I  also  have  also  to
    consider the  claimant's  serious  offending  history,  the  unrebutted
    conclusion that he remains a danger to the community  of  the  UK,  and
    that he has demonstrated quite graphically that he is not socially  and
    culturally integrated in the UK.

29. I also accept Mr Jarvis' written and oral submissions that article 8 is
    not a watered-down article 3 route to leave to remain. Effectively, the
    claimant would be asking the tribunal to allow his appeal on article  8
    destitution or medical grounds where it had conspicuously failed  under
    article 3. As held in SL (St  Lucia)  v  SSHD  [2018]  EWCA  Civ  1894,
    article 8 is not article 3 with merely a lower threshold. "It does  not
    provide some sort of safety net where a medical case fails  to  satisfy
    the article 3 criteria... the fact that a person is receiving treatment
    which is not available in the country of return may be a factor in  the
    proportionality balancing exercise but that  factor  cannot  by  itself
    give  rise  to  a  breach  of  article  8."  Even  as  a  factor  in  a
    proportionality balancing exercise  the  evidence  is  insufficient  to
    sustain an article 8 claim balanced  against  the  very  strong  public
    interest which statute requires me to place in the balance.

30. Taking all of the above factors into consideration and for the  reasons
    stated above, I find that the claimant fails to  demonstrate  that  his
    removal would breach articles 2, 3 or 8 ECHR.  He  is  prohibited  from
    relying on any asylum or humanitarian protection claim and has not been
    able to demonstrate very compelling circumstances over  and  above  the
    exceptions to deportation set out in statute  and  in  the  Immigration
    Rules.
