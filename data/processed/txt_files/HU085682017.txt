                      ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER, Pretoria
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr C McGinley, of Gray & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Zimbabwe, born  on  14  April  1999.   He
    sought entry clearance to settle in the UK under paragraph 297  of  the
    immigration rules, to join his mother.  The ECO refused his application
    on 30 May 2017, and that decision was confirmed on review by  an  Entry
    Clearance Manager on 25 January 2018.  FtT Judge  Boyle  dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal by a decision promulgated  on  28  June  2018.   The
    appellant appealed to the UT.

 2. Representatives agreed that the case fell to be resolved as follows.

 3. The respondent accepted at the hearing in the FtT that the  sponsor  is
    the appellant's mother.  The judge accepted that  his  father  died  in
    2014.  At that stage, the case came within sub-paragraph 297  (i)  (d),
    one parent being present and settled in the  UK  and  the  other  being
    dead.  It was no longer a case under sub-paragraph (i) (e), and did not
    turn on "sole responsibility".

 4. The evidence was that the appellant in terms of sub-paragraph 297 (iii)
    was  not  "leading  an  independent  life"  and  had  not  "formed   an
    independent family unit".  His case met the requirements  of  paragraph
    297.

 5. The appeal was not under the  rules,  but  available  on  human  rights
    grounds only.  However, this area of the  rules  being  broadly  "human
    rights compliant",  it  followed  that  the  appeal  should  have  been
    allowed.

 6. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.  The  appeal,  as
    originally brought to the FtT, is allowed.

 7. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
