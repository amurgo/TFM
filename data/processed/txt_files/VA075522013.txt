Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr G Harrison, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Reyaz


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1.   The appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home  Department  to
      whom I shall refer as the claimant.  The respondent is  a  citizen  of
      Pakistan who was born on 6th March, 1982 and who made  application  to
      the  claimant  for  leave  to  enter  the  United  Kingdom  under  the
      requirements of paragraph 41 under Statement of Changes in Immigration
      Rules HC 395 as amended.


   2.   The respondent's application was considered by the  Entry  Clearance
      Officer, but refused.  The Entry  Clearance  Officer  noted  that  the
      respondent had previously travelled to the  United  Kingdom  and  took
      issue with the fact  that  the  respondent  stayed  on  that  previous
      occasion for some four months, nine weeks longer than he had  said  he
      would stay on his application form.  However, there is  no  suggestion
      anywhere that he stayed in breach of his leave, which of  course  will
      have been for six months so he was perfectly entitled to remain in the
      United Kingdom on the earlier occasion for up to six months.

   3.   The Entry Clearance Officer noted that  the  respondent  claimed  to
      earn the equivalent of �67 a month from his  employment  plus  �733  a
      year from his land; whether that is rental income or income derived by
      farming is not clear.  The Entry Clearance Officer suggested that  the
      respondent's income was not reflected in the bank statements  provided
      and was not  satisfied  therefore  that  the  bank  statement  was  an
      accurate  reflection  of  the  respondent's  personal  and   financial
      circumstances and was not satisfied that the respondent had accurately
      portrayed his circumstances  in  Pakistan  or  his  true  reasons  for
      wishing to travel to the United Kingdom.


   4.   The application was refused on the basis  that  the  respondent  had
      failed to discharge the  burden  on  him  to  show  that  he  met  the
      requirements of paragraph 41(i) and 41(ii).

   5.   The respondent appealed and  his  appeal  was  heard  by  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Mark Davies at a hearing on  22nd  October,  2013.   In
      that determination, the judge found, after  hearing  the  respondent's
      sponsor, that the respondent had satisfied  the  requirements  of  the
      Immigration Rules and allowed the appeal.

   6.   The Secretary of State was dissatisfied with  the  judge's  decision
      and in an application for permission to appeal which was granted said:-



             "JFTT has not borne in mind that the onus is on the  appellant
             to demonstrate that  he  satisfies  the  requirements  of  the
             Immigration  Rules  at  [11]  the  JFTT  found  that  he   was
             satisfied, having received reliable evidence from the  sponsor
             that the respondent was a genuine visitor.  However  the  JFTT
             failed to give adequate reasons  to  allow  the  appellant  to
             discern why he accepted this argument and what  the  sponsor's
             evidence was  as  there  is  no  expression  for  the  finding
             whatsoever in the determination."

   7.   Before me, Mr Harrison relied on the grounds and told me had nothing
      further to add and I advised Mr Reyaz that I did not need to hear from
      him.


   8.   The judge set out the burden and standard of proof at paragraph 3 of
      his determination, which I fully accept, is  a  very  brief  one.   In
      paragraph 11 the judge said:

             "I am satisfied, having received credible  evidence  from  the
             sponsor, that the appellant is  a  genuine  visitor  who  will
             leave the United Kingdom at the conclusion of his visit.   The
             evidence shows  that  the  appellant  can  be  maintained  and
             accommodated during the course of  his  visit  to  the  United
             Kingdom and that he can  pay  for  his  journey  to  and  from
             Pakistan.  I am also satisfied he is intending  to  visit  his
             brother-in-law in the United Kingdom and therefore has a valid
             right of appeal."

   9.   The judge has made clear findings based on the  evidence  he  heard.
      He has not set out a summary of that  evidence,  but  nonetheless  his
      findings are clear and in the circumstances I find that  there  is  no
      error of law in the judge's determination which I uphold.
