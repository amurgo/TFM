For the Appellant:     Miss J Todd, of Latta & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent refused the appellant's claim for reasons  explained  in
    her letter dated 18 April 2016.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Farrelly dismissed the appellant's appeal for
    reasons explained in his decision promulgated on 24 May 2017.

 3. In terms of the Tribunal Procedure (UT) Rules 2008, rule 23  (1A),  the
    appellant's application for permission to  appeal  now  stands  as  the
    notice of appeal to the UT.  It sets out grounds which,  read  shortly,
    are as follows:

      (1).  Error at �36 in finding that the appellant has continued contact
      with family in Iraq, which overlooks his evidence that he was able  to
      speak to his family by telephone 3 times since he came to the UK,  but
      was unable to reach them again.

      (2), (3) and (4).  Error at �37 in finding that  the  appellant  could
      return to Kirkuk, based on evidence that Isis no longer had a grip  on
      the city, when country guidance stated  that  Kirkuk  is  a  contested
      area.  The one article relied upon by the judge  was  insufficient  to
      depart from the country guidance in respect of Kirkuk no longer  being
      a contested area.  Case  law  emphasised  the  need  for  very  strong
      grounds supported by cogent evidence in order not  to  follow  country
      guidance.

      (5) Error at �38 in finding the appellant would be able to relocate to
      the IKR, which overlooked the practicalities of travel from Baghdad to
      the IKR. The appellant said he did not  have  an  Iraqi  passport.  He
      could return to Baghdad only on a laissez  passer,  a  one-way  travel
      document which would be taken from him on arrival. He would be  unable
      to travel to the IKR as a travel document  is  required  for  internal
      flights, and would be unable to travel by land as  he  would  have  to
      travel through contested areas.

 4. Submissions for appellant.  It was not open to the judge, standing  the
    country guidance, and on the one news article before him,  to  find  it
    possible for the appellant to return to Kirkuk.  The respondent  relied
    on Amin [2017] EWHC 2417 (Admin) at �63, but that was a judicial review
    not a statutory appeal, was now under appeal, and was wrongly  decided.
    The appellant's case was not correctly dismissed by the judge at �38  -
    39, because there was no exploration of his circumstances by  reference
    to guidance on relocation in Baghdad.  It was accepted that  he  was  a
    Sunni Kurd but not from the KRG, so return could only  be  to  Baghdad.
    The judge made no express finding on the contact he had with his family
    and consequent ability to replace documentation and otherwise adapt  to
    return. The guidance flagged these up as crucial issues, so they needed
    explicit findings and could not be left to  inference.   Rehearing  was
    required,  limited  to  the  issues   of   family   contact   and   the
    practicalities of internal relocation.

 5. Submissions for respondent.  The grounds did not challenge the  finding
    that the appellant could relocate in Baghdad.  That was decisive. There
    had been no application to amend and the widened challenge  should  not
    be admitted.  In any event, the judge's findings at  �30  and  36  were
    also unchallenged, and were sufficient to dispose of the case,  as  the
    appellant's claim to have no family or other connections  in  Iraq  was
    plainly rejected.  The Judge's findings on return to Kirkuk  were  open
    to him and were supported by Amin but the issue was incidental,  as  it
    had been found the appellant could relocate elsewhere. If he failed  on
    his family contact point, the rest was immaterial.

 6. I reserved my decision.

 7. It is in the first place for an appellant to establish his case to  the
    lower standard, not for a tribunal to achieve impossible insights  into
    his true circumstances.

 8. The judge rejected the appellant's credibility at �30, which includes a
    finding that he "has fabricated his claim in order to remain here".

 9. At �36 the judge noted communications which the appellant  admitted  to
    having had with family and others, and his claim to have had a passport
    "which the agent took", and went on, "There would appear to  be  enough
    sources to establish his identity to  the  Iraqi  authorities  ...  the
    appellant  has  not  demonstrated  travel   documentation   cannot   be
    obtained".

10. Reading the decision fairly and as a whole, the judge did not  overlook
    the appellant's evidence on absence of useful contacts, or  on  absence
    of and inability to obtain documentation.  Rather,  the  judge  plainly
    rejected it.

11. The case at that point was  bound  to  fail,  due  to  availability  of
    relocation to the KRG.

12. Even if travel was to be  via  Baghdad,  the  appellant  had  shown  no
    difficulty in his way.

13. No error is shown in the finding that the appellant might  relocate  in
    Baghdad, but that was only in the alternative.

14. Ability to go home to Kirkuk (or somewhere around the city  of  Kirkuk;
    the appellant's case was rather vaguely put)  is  also  not  the  crux.
    However, Amin, while not binding, is persuasive;  no  reason  has  been
    shown not to follow it; and if a further decision  had  to  be  reached
    regarding Kirkuk, that would be on up  to  date  information.   Country
    guidance does not purport to fix the boundaries of contested  areas  in
    time to come, but is subject to later evidence.

15. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

16. The FtT made an anonymity direction, although  not  apparently  on  the
    application of the appellant, and for no stated reason.  The matter was
    not addressed in the UT, so anonymity has been preserved herein.
