                                     and

                              Dr Twegise Mugisa
                                    [M M]
                        (no anonymity direction made)
                                                                 Respondents


For the Appellant:     Mr McVeety,   Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Khan, Manchester Associates

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The First Respondent (Dr Mugisa) is a doctor who has applied for  leave
    to remain as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant in order to work  in  the  NHS.
    The Second Appellant is her minor son, whose own  appeal  is  dependent
    upon the outcome in hers. They are both nationals of Jamaica.


 2. Dr Mugisa came to the United Kingdom in September  2013  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student Migrant.  She was already a  doctor  at  that  point,
    having qualified in 2006. She came to the UK to undertake post-graduate
    study, which she paid for privately.   She made her application to vary
    her leave on the 13th December 2014. The application was refused on the
    3rd February 2015. The only matter in issue was whether Dr Mugisa would
    be earning enough in her role as 'Clinical Fellow - Emergency  Services
    and Critical Care'.  The NHS Trust  which  wanted  to  employ  her  had
    completed a Certificate of Sponsorship which stated that her role  most
    closely corresponded to the  occupation  code  2211  of  the  Codes  of
    Practice as set out in Appendix J of the  Immigration  Rules.   At  the
    date of the decision the minimum acceptable rate of pay for a 37.5 hour
    working week in that role was �30,002 per annum.   The  Certificate  of
    Sponsorship stated that the salary of �30,002 was to be paid for  a  48
    hour week.   That would amount to a salary of �23,439 for a  37.5  hour
    week. This was below  the  minimum  rate  specified  in  the  Codes  of
    Practice and the application was therefore refused.


 3. The matter came before the First-tier Tribunal on the 14th August 2015.
    The First-tier Tribunal had been provided  with  a  letter  written  by
    Eleanor Devlin, Assistant HR Director at the Tier 2  Sponsor,  Tameside
    Hospital NHS Trust. Ms Devlin wrote that the Certificate of Sponsorship
    had contained a mistake and that Dr Mugisa would  in  fact  be  working
    37.5 hours per  week  for  a  minimum  salary  of  �30,002.  Ms  Devlin
    highlighted that this would be the very minimum received, and that  the
    pay could be as much as �39,693, depending on Dr  Mugisa's  experience.
    Having taken this evidence into  account  the  Tribunal  accepted  that
    there was a mistake on the face of the Certificate of Sponsorship, that
    Dr Mugisa would be earning at least the minimum salary specified in the
    Code of Practice 2211, and allowed the appeal.    The  letter  from  Ms
    Devlin was dated the 9th February 2014.

 4. The Secretary of State has now  appealed  against  that  decision.  She
    relies on s85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  to
    submit that the Tribunal was not entitled to take  into  account  post-
    application evidence in this Points Based System case.


    Error of Law

 5. I am not satisfied that there was any error in the First-tier  Tribunal
    allowing this appeal. The premise of the Secretary of State's appeal is
    that the letter from Ms Devlin  should  have  been  excluded  as  post-
    application evidence under s85A(2)(3)(b):


         85A
         Matters to be considered: new evidence: exceptions


         (1) This section sets out the exceptions mentioned in section
         85(5).


         (2) Exception 1 is that in relation to an appeal under section
         82(1) against an immigration decision of a kind specified in
         section 82(2)(b) or (c) the Tribunal may consider only the
         circumstances appertaining at the time of the decision.


         (3) Exception 2 applies to an appeal under section 82(1) if-


           a) the appeal is against an immigration decision of a kind
              specified in section
              82(2)(a) or (d),
           b) the immigration decision concerned an application of a kind
              identified in
              immigration rules as requiring to be considered under a
              "Points Based System", and
           c) the appeal relies wholly or partly on grounds specified in
              section 84(1)(a), (e) or (f).


         (4)  Where Exception 2 applies the Tribunal may consider evidence
         adduced by the appellant only if it-


           a) was submitted in support of, and at the time of making, the
              application to
              which the immigration decision related,
           b) relates to the appeal in so far as it relies on grounds other
              than those
              specified in subsection (3)(c),
           (c)  is adduced to prove that a document is genuine or valid, or
           (d)  is adduced in connection with the Secretary of State's
         reliance on a
                                    discretion under immigration rules, or
compliance with a requirement of
                  immigration rules, to refuse an application on grounds
         not related to the
                  acquisition of "points" under the "Points Based System".

 6. What the author of the grounds does not appear to  have  considered  is
    the purpose or significance of the letter in terms of  s85A(4)(c).  The
    letter from Tameside NHS Trust, as is  made  clear  on  its  face,  was
    simply to correct an error  of  the  Certificate  of  Sponsorship.  The
    correction went to establishing the validity  of  the  offer,  and  the
    sponsorship itself.   I am satisfied that this 'exception' to Exception
    2 therefore applied. The First-tier Tribunal was entitled  to  take  Ms
    Devlin's letter into account.


 7. Although the First-tier Tribunal did not make any reference to  it,  it
    is further  arguable  that  paragraph  245AA  of  the  Rules  was  also
    pertinent:

       .          (a)Where Part 6A or any appendices referred to in Part 6A
         state that specified documents must be provided, the Entry
         Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary of State
         will only consider documents that have been submitted with the
         application, and will only consider documents submitted after the
         application where they are submitted in accordance with
         subparagraph (b).
       .
       .          (b)If the applicant has submitted specified documents in
         which:
       .
               . (i)  Some of the documents in a sequence have been omitted
                 (for example, if one bank statement from a series is
                 missing);
               . (ii) A document is in the wrong format (for example, if a
                 letter is not on letterhead paper as specified); or
               . (iii) A document is a copy and not an original document; or
               . (iv)A document does not contain all of the specified
                 information;
               .
       .          the Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or the
         Secretary of State may contact the applicant or his representative
         in writing, and request the correct documents. The requested
         documents must be received at the address specified in the request
         within 7 working days of the date of the request.
       .
       .          (c)Documents will not be requested where a specified
         document has not been submitted (for example an English language
         certificate is missing), or where the Entry Clearance Officer,
         Immigration Officer or the Secretary of State does not anticipate
         that addressing the omission or error referred to in subparagraph
         (b) will lead to a grant because the application will be refused
         for other reasons.

       .
       .          (d)If the applicant has submitted a specified document:
       .
               . (i) in the wrong format; or
       .                     (ii) which is a copy and not an original
         document; or
               . (iii) which does not contain all of the specified
                 information, but the missing information is verifiable
                 from:
       .               (1) other documents submitted with the application,
       .               (2)the website of the organisation which issued the
              1.             document, or
       .               (3)    the website of the appropriate regulatory
         body;
                  the application may be granted exceptionally,


         providing the Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or the
         Secretary of State is satisfied that the specified documents are
         genuine and the applicant meets all the other requirements...

 8. There was before the Secretary of  State  an  email  from  the  Tier  2
    Sponsor dated 21st November 2014 stating that the salary scale for  the
    role was �30,002 to �47,175 per annum and that this would be for  a  40
    hour  week  (i.e.  37.5  paid  working  hours).  There  was   therefore
    information before the Secretary  of  State  which  provided  the  full
    information required. There was no suggestion that any of the documents
    relied upon were not genuine. In the  circumstances  the  Secretary  of
    State should have applied her own evidential flexibility policy.


    Decisions

 9. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain any error such
    that it should be set aside. The decision is upheld.


10. I was  not  asked  to  make  a  direction  for  anonymity  and  in  the
    circumstances I see no reason to do so.
