                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the appellant: Mr M Hossain of Hossain Law Associates
For the respondent: Mr P Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

     CONSENT TO WITHDRWAL OF CASES BEFORE UPPER TRIBUNAL: RULE 17 OF THE
               TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008


1.   At the hearing on 19 August 2014, the Tribunal gave its consent to  the
    withdrawal by Mr  Deller  of  the  respondent's  case,  comprising  the
    decisions of 11 June 2013 (a) to refuse to vary the  appellant's  leave
    to remain in the  United  Kingdom  and  (b)  to  remove  the  appellant
    pursuant to section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act
    2006. As a result, the appellant's  application  of  17  May  2013  for
    variation of leave remains outstanding before the  respondent  and  the
    respondent accepts that the appellant has not breached any  immigration
    laws by reason only of remaining in the United  Kingdom  following  the
    expiration of his leave on 28 June 2014.

2.    In consequence of the above, at the  hearing  the  appellant  withdrew
    his case before the Upper Tribunal and the Tribunal consented  to  that
    withdrawal.
