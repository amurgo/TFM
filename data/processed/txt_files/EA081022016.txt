                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW

Background

1.   The appellant is a citizen of India  who  was  born  on  2nd  September
    1992.  He made application to the respondent for a  residence  card  as
    the family member of an EEA national on 3rd  January  2013.   This  was
    granted on 4th March 2013  and  as  a  result  he  was  issued  with  a
    residence card  until  4th  March  2018.   The  respondent  served  the
    appellant  with  a  decision  to  remove  him  dated  20th  June  2016.
    Unfortunately, that notice did  not  explain  why  the  respondent  had
    decided to remove the appellant.  It transpires that the respondent had
    conducted a search of an address and spoken to the appellant's  claimed
    wife.  She confessed that she had been paid ï¿½10,000  to  enter  into  a
    false marriage with the appellant.  She said that she had  never  lived
    with him.  Officers also spoke to the appellant at his address  and  he
    claimed that he had entered into a genuine marriage and  that  she  was
    saying that simply to 'get' at him.  He claimed to have divorced her in
    February 2016, and said that all the paperwork was at his solicitors.

The First Tier Tribunal hearing

2.   As a consequence, the respondent was satisfied that  the  marriage  was
    one of convenience and decided  to  revoke  the  residence  card.   The
    appellant appealed and his appeal  was  heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Woolley sitting at Newport on 25th July 2017.  The appellant  did
    not attend and was not represented.

3.   At the hearing, the respondent produced and relied upon evidence  which
    had  not  been  supplied  earlier  to  the  appellant.   That  evidence
    consisted of a record of the immigration visit at  interview  conducted
    with the appellant's wife.  The judge took that evidence into  account,
    notwithstanding  the  fact  that  it  had  not  been  supplied  to  the
    appellant.

4.   Mr Duffy accepted today that that amounted to a material error of  law.
     It was wrong for the judge to consider evidence  which  had  not  been
    supplied to the appellant or to his advisors, because the appellant had
    been denied the opportunity of making a response and commenting on  it.



5.   It has been suggested to me on behalf of the appellant by Mr  Raw  that
    because the judge fell into error and accepted the evidence  which  had
    not been seen by the appellant, I should simply allow the appeal today.
     He suggested that instead of hearing the appeal  and  considering  the
    fresh evidence, the First Tier Tribunal Judge could have  adjourned  to
    give the respondent time to serve the evidence on the appellant  or  in
    the alternative  could  have  simply  allowed  the  appellant's  appeal
    outright.

6.   I am satisfied that there is a material error of  law  in  the  judge's
    decision such that the appellant has been denied a fair  hearing.   The
    judge was wrong to consider evidence which had not been supplied to the
    appellant.  He has been denied the opportunity  of  commenting  on  it.
    The judge should have adjourned the hearing  until  such  time  as  the
    appellant and his solicitors had been served  with  copies  of  it,  in
    order that he might respond to it.

7.   There would have been no basis on which the First Tier  Tribunal  Judge
    could have allowed the appellant's appeal outright.  The respondent was
    entitled to ask the  judge  to  consider  new  evidence  prior  to  the
    conclusion of the hearing.  It would equally have  been  wrong  of  the
    judge to deny the respondent the opportunity of adducing the evidence.

8    There is no basis  upon  which  I  can  allow  the  appellant's  appeal
    outright now.  The respondent wished to rely on fresh evidence  and  is
    entitled to have that evidence considered.

9    My decision is that the matter  will  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and to be heard  afresh  by  a  judge  other  than  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge C J Woolley.  No interpreter is required.

10.   One and a half hours should be allowed to the hearing of the appeal.

Richard Chalkley
 Upper Tribunal Judge Chalkley



    I DIRECT THAT the respondent shall file with the  First  Tier  Tribunal
    and serve on the appellant and those representing him, with a  copy  of
    the additional evidence of the appellant's former wife if  reliance  is
    to be placed upon such evidence.

Richard Chalkley
Upper Tribunal Judge Chalkley
