                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appellant is a national of Gambia date of birth 16th February 1968.   He
appeals with permission[1] the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  RL
Meates) to dismiss his appeal against a decision  to  remove  him  from  the
United Kingdom pursuant to s10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.  That
decision  followed  from  the  Respondent's  rejection  of  the  Appellant's
protection claim.

There were two planks to the  Appellant's  case.  The  first  concerned  his
family and private life in the UK. He had entered the country as  a  visitor
in 2003, overstayed and ten years later, on the  17th  April  2013,  made  a
claim under  Article  8  on  the  basis  of  his  long  residence,  and  his
relationship with a British national Ms J W.   This  ground  of  appeal  was
rejected by both  Respondent  and  First-tier  Tribunal,  and  there  is  no
challenge to that decision.

The second plank of the case  concerned  the  Appellant's  claimed  fear  of
persecution for reasons of his political opinion in  Gambia.  The  Appellant
asserts that he had been involved in politics in Gambia prior to  coming  to
the UK in 2003; as a  supporter  of  the  United  Democratic  Party  he  had
attended meetings and "observed" rallies.    He had not taken a more  active
role because he was worried about the consequences  at  work  -  he  was  an
employee of the state telecommunication company, Gamtel.   Whilst in the  UK
in 2003 he had been told that his home had been  searched,  his  car  burned
out and two of his close friends had been  kidnapped.  He  decided  to  stay
here because he was afraid to return home.    He  maintained  his  political
beliefs,  and  was  against  the  President  of  Gambia.  He  had   attended
demonstrations against the president whilst in the UK,  in  2006,  2011  and
2014.  He produced a DVD showing him  on  a  demonstration  which  had  been
uploaded onto Youtube.  He had blogged about political issues in Gambia.

The First-tier Tribunal rejected the account of political activity prior  to
coming to the UK. The Appellant's explanation as to why he failed  to  claim
asylum at any point between 2003 and 2014 was  rejected,  and  the  Tribunal
found there to be inconsistencies in the account.   As  for  the  sur  place
activity the First-tier Tribunal found there to  be  no  evidence  that  the
Appellant had attended demonstrations in the UK in 2006  and  2011.  It  was
accepted that in 2014 he had taken part in a march from Trafalgar Square  to
Whitehall but the images showed this to be a "low level"  demonstration  and
there was no evidence to suggest that the Gambian authorities had been  made
aware of it. The Appellant's blogs did not  contain  any  overtly  political
content and again, it was not clear how the author "D" might  be  identified
as the Appellant.    The  Tribunal  found  there  to  be  no  real  risk  of
persecution in Gambia and the appeal was dismissed.

The grounds of appeal are that the First-tier Tribunal erred in:

    a) Failing to apply the ratio of YB (Eritrea) [2008] EWCA Civ  360.  It
       is submitted that requiring the  Appellant  to  establish  that  the
       Gambian authorities would  know  about,  and  act  upon,  opposition
       protests in foreign lands was perverse, given the evidence about the
       repressive nature of that regime;


    b) Failing  to  take  account  of  country  background  material  which
       indicated  that  the  Gambian  authorities  did  in   fact   monitor
       opposition activities abroad;

    c) Failing to give reasons for the finding that  the  demonstration  of
       July 2014 was "low level"; the Appellant points out that the  images
       produced show the presence of prominent Gambian dissidents,  notably
       the deposed Vice-President, Hon.Bakary Bunja Dabo;

    d) The determination  apparently  accepts  that  the  march  went  from
       Trafalgar Square to Whitehall but then finds it to  "unclear"  where
       the demonstration took place. This is contradictory.

The Respondent opposes the appeal on all grounds.  It is submitted that  the
Judge gave sufficient reasons for finding that the Appellant's very  limited
involvement would not place him at risk.


My Findings

The Appellant relies on the well-known passage from the judgement of  Sedley
LJ in YB (Erirea) [2008] EWCA Civ 360:

         As has been seen (ï¿½7 above), the tribunal, while accepting that the
         appellant's political activity in this country  was  genuine,  were
         not prepared to accept in the absence of positive evidence that the
         Eritrean authorities had "the means and the inclination" to monitor
         such activities as a demonstration outside their embassy,  or  that
         they would be able to identify the appellant  from  photographs  of
         the demonstration. In my judgment, and without disrespect  to  what
         is a specialist tribunal, this is  a  finding  which  risks  losing
         contact with reality. Where, as here, the  tribunal  has  objective
         evidence which "paints  a  bleak  picture  of  the  suppression  of
         political opponents" by a named government, it requires  little  or
         no evidence or speculation to arrive at a strong possibility -  and
         perhaps more  -  that  its  foreign  legations  not  only  film  or
         photograph their nationals who demonstrate in  public  against  the
         regime  but   have   informers   among   expatriate   oppositionist
         organisations  who  can  name  the  people  who   are   filmed   or
         photographed. Similarly it does not require affirmative evidence to
         establish a probability that  the  intelligence  services  of  such
         states monitor the internet  for  information  about  oppositionist
         groups. The real question in most cases will be  what  follows  for
         the individual claimant. If, for example, any information  reaching
         the embassy is likely to be  that  the  claimant  identified  in  a
         photograph  is  a  hanger-on  with  no  real  commitment   to   the
         oppositionist cause, that will go directly to the issue flagged  up
         by art 4(3)(d) of the Directive.

This case did not concern Eritrea, but Gambia. The  Appellant  points  to  a
good deal of evidence showing that the government in  Gambia  does  suppress
political dissent. There was one item in  the  bundle  before  the  Tribunal
concerning the arrest of a dissident who had attended a protest in the  USA.
 The Appellant points to this as confirmation, if it were  needed  in  light
of  YB,  that  dissident  activity  abroad  is  monitored  by  the   Gambian
authorities and that action is can be taken  against  protestors  when  they
return home.

The First-tier Tribunal dealt with this aspect of the  Appellant's  case  at
paragraph 34. Having accepted that the Appellant did attend a  demonstration
in central London in July 2014 (some weeks after he had claimed asylum)  the
First-tier Tribunal concludes:

         "I note that the Appellant has not adduced any evidence either oral
         or in writing to suggest that the Gambian authorities were aware of
         his attendance at the demonstration.  Given  that  he  has  friends
         within the police, National Intelligence Agency and the Immigration
         Department one would have expected the Appellant  would  have  been
         able to adduce evidence that the  authorities  were  aware  of  his
         attendance at this demonstration and that as a  result  he  was  at
         risk. He has failed to do so  and  as  such  I  conclude  that  the
         authorities were unaware of his attendance at this demonstration".

I have considerable doubt about whether Lord Justice Sedley's  logic  in  YB
can be extended to apply to any  country  where  human  rights  abuses  take
place. He was dealing with  an  appeal  concerning  the  particular  factual
matrix  relating  to  Eritrea,  an  exceptionally  paranoid  and   zealously
oppressive state.  The country background material was such that  it  raised
an inference that a demonstration outside of the Eritrean embassy in  London
would be monitored.  It was accepted that photographs had  been  taken,  but
the Upper Tribunal had dismissed the appeal for the absence of the  evidence
that the Eritreans had the technology or inclination to  identify  nationals
pictured in them. The inference  drawn  by  Lord  Justice  Sedley  therefore
filled a far smaller evidential gap. The Tribunal in this  case  has  simply
accepted that the Appellant attended a "low key"  demonstration  in  central
London some miles from the Gambian  High  Commission.   Even  if  I  accept,
applying the lower standard of  proof,  that  some  risk  of  identification
could be inferred, the "real question" remains: would the  Appellant  simply
be viewed by the Gambian authorities as an  opportunistic  hanger-on  rather
than an actual political opponent?

The First-tier Tribunal found that the Appellant had been in  the  UK  since
2003 and that for eleven years he did not claim asylum.  The  Tribunal  gave
careful consideration to the reasons advanced for that  delay,  and  to  the
Appellant's claims about his political activity prior to coming to  the  UK.
His explanations were rejected. Having heard the oral evidence the  Tribunal
could not find, on the lower standard, that the Appellant had ever  had  any
political involvement at all, or that he had ever done  anything  likely  to
attract the adverse attention  of  the  Gambian  government.  In  answer  to
Sedley LJ's "real question" the Appellant would appear  to  be  the  classic
"opportunistic hanger-on".  There was no evidence that he would face a  risk
on return to Gambia in these circumstances. Whether or  not  the  First-tier
Tribunal was entitled to dismiss the appeal for the reasons set out  in  the
grounds, this cannot be shown to be an error such that the  decision  should
be set aside. That is because it was the Tribunal's clear finding  that  the
Appellant was not genuinely involved in politics; nor did he have  a  reason
to fear return to Gambia.


Decisions

The determination contains no error of law and it is upheld.

In view of the subject matter of this appeal  I  am  satisfied,  having  had
regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  and
the Presidential Guidance Note No 1  of  2013:  Anonymity  Orders,  that  it
would be appropriate to make a direction for anonymity  and  do  so  in  the
following terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
         family.  This direction applies both to the Appellant  and  to  the
         Respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction  could  lead  to
         contempt of court proceedings".
