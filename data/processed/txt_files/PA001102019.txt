                            DECISION AND REASONS

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


 1. These are a written record of the oral reasons given for our decision
    at the hearing.

 2. This is an appeal by the appellant in respect of a decision of Judge of
    the First-tier Tribunal Boylan-Kemp (the  'FtT')promulgated  on  2  May
    2019, in which she refused the appellant's appeal on the  basis  of  an
    asylum and human rights application, which the appellant had made on 14
    July 2018. The respondent had refused the appellant's application in  a
    decision dated 7 December 2018.

Background

 3. The background circumstances are that the appellant is  a  national  of
    Iran and he arrived clandestinely in the UK on 14 July  2018,  when  he
    claimed asylum.  The gist of his asylum claim is  that  whilst  it  was
    accepted that he is an Iranian national of Kurdish  ethnic  origin,  he
    also claims to have smuggled illegal goods, including alcohol, starting
    in 2010 with his father and then  with  a  friend;  and  also,  on  two
    occasions, transported political material relating to the KDP with  the
    friend. He transported KDP material successfully on the first occasion,
    but on the second occasion, he  became  aware  that  the  Etilaat  were
    looking for him. He was shot at by men in two vehicles and  he  managed
    to escape to Iraq.

 4. In the respondent's decision, she rejected the appellant's claims to be
    a smuggler or to have come to the adverse attention of the Etilaat. She
    did not accept the reliability of photographs said to  show  smuggling.
    She regarded as inconsistent the appellant's account of what  political
    materials he believed he was smuggling, and  regarded  as  implausible,
    his account of escape from the Etilaat on foot, while being shot at  by
    pursuers in vehicles; and other aspects of his account  of  fleeing  to
    Iraq.

The FtT 's Decision

 5. In rejecting the appellant's application, the FtT was not impressed  by
    the appellant's general credibility  and  also  made  specific  adverse
    credibility findings.  In relation his general  credibility,  at  [16],
    she noted he failed to claim asylum in safe countries whilst  en  route
    to the UK, particularly Serbia and Greece, for the purposes of  section
    8 of the Asylum and Immigration  (Treatment  of  Claimants,  etc.)  Act
    2004.  She went on to consider photographs of the appellant,  at  [18],
    noting that they could be  interpreted  as  showing  the  appellant  as
    having been involved in smuggling activities, but  she  placed  limited
    weight on them, as the dates on which they were taken  and  the  places
    where they  were  taken  was  unclear,  and  she  did  not  accept  the
    appellant's explanation for how he had received the photographs from  a
    friend.

 6. She went on to say that although  there  were  inconsistencies  in  the
    appellant's account  of  transporting  political  material,  they  were
    insufficient to significantly undermine his claim 'per se,' but in  the
    light of the adverse credibility findings and 'other issues  identified
    with his account' she was not satisfied to the lower standard of  proof
    as to the credibility of his account.

 7. At [22], she considered the plausibility of the appellant's account  of
    escaping from  men  in  two  vehicles,  who  were  shooting  him.   She
    concluded that he had given no reasonable explanation as to how he  had
    managed to escape his pursuers; how the authorities had become aware of
    him; or how he had been able to cross from Iran to Iraq on foot, whilst
    being pursued by the authorities.  The FtT regarded  neither  of  those
    accounts as plausible  or  credible.   At  [23],  she  noted  that  the
    appellant had not produced any written evidence of his father's claimed
    arrest; and  she  regarded  his  actions,  in  posting  anti-government
    material on social media, as inconsistent with his  claimed  fears  for
    his relatives.

Grounds of Appeal

 8. The appellant submitted grounds of appeal  on  15  May  2019,  in  very
    general terms.  First, he asserted that the  FtT's  assessment  of  his
    credibility at [16] to [18] of the decision was 'irrational'.  When  we
    explored with Mr Khan at the hearing today as  to  the  basis  of  this
    ground, while he made no formal withdrawal of the ground,  he  did  not
    wish to rely on it, stating that such a test was more appropriate to  a
    judicial review application. The  ground  referred,  in  the  paragraph
    references,  to  most  of  the  FtT's  findings  of   fact   and   were
    unparticularised.  Mr Khan did not elaborate on them further.

 9. Second, the appellant asserted that the  FtT  had  erred  in  assessing
    inconsistencies in his account of transporting KDP  material  as  being
    immaterial, but then attached weight to them because she did not accept
    other aspects of his claim. Mr Khan said that the reasoning at [20] was
    confusing and inconsistent.

10. Third, the appellant argued that the FtT had  erred  in  assessing  the
    appellant's  credibility  on  his  inability  to  produce   documentary
    evidence in relation to his father's arrest.   When we  discussed  with
    Mr Khan how it was said that the FtT had erred, when  it  was  open  to
    her, in the context of paragraph 339L(ii) of the Immigration Rules,  to
    consider the absence  of  all  material  evidence  at  the  appellant's
    disposal having been submitted; or a satisfactory explanation  for  the
    lack of such evidence. Once again, while Mr Khan did not withdraw  this
    ground, he did not seek to make any further submissions on it.

11. Fourth, the appellant argued that the FtT failed to assess the material
    facts of the appellant's claim  in  accordance  with  the  guidance  at
    paragraph [73] of the authority of KS (benefit  of  the  doubt)  [2014]
    UKUT 552 (IAC).  Whilst we considered that  particular  authority,  the
    principle in it is very general, and the  gist  is  that  a  First-tier
    Tribunal should consider all  of  the  evidence  holistically  and  not
    compartmentalise it and  discount  particular  evidence,  for  example,
    because of adverse credibility findings, before  reaching  their  final
    conclusion.  However, while the ground asserted that the FtT had erred,
    the ground provided no specific details.

12. A final ground,  included  in  an  application  by  the  appellant  for
    permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal, asserted that the FtT  had
    failed to consider the risk factors set out  in  the  Country  Guidance
    case of HB (Kurds) Iran CG [2018] UKUT 00430 (IAC).  The FtT had failed
    to consider the risk to the appellant as an Iranian, of Kurdish  ethnic
    origin, and who had posted highly critical comments about  the  Iranian
    authorities on social media.  Even if  contrived  for  the  purpose  of
    bolstering a protection claim, it was said that the FtT had  failed  to
    consider the risk of adverse attention.  If his political beliefs  were
    genuine, he could not be expected to delete his social media posts  and
    if not genuine, they would still risk discovery.  While  there  was  no
    application to amend the grounds on this  last  point,  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Norton-Taylor had set aside a previous  Upper  Tribunal  decision
    and relisted it for an error of law  hearing  in  a  decision  dated  5
    November 2019 on the basis that HB had not been considered.

Discussion and Conclusions

13. We deal first of all with the grounds other than  in  relation  to  the
    authority of HB.  We first deal with the grounds that were not  pursued
    by Mr Khan.  The first ground, that  the  FtT  had  reached  irrational
    conclusions in her assessment of credibility,  was  not  one  that  was
    pursued by Mr Khan beyond that generalised assertion.  We dismiss  that
    ground as it identifies no error of law with any particularity.

14.  In  relation  to  the  third  ground,  namely  an  assessment  of  the
    appellant's credibility, by reference to the  appellant  not  producing
    documentary  evidence  in  relation  to  his  father's  arrest  or   an
    explanation for the absence of such documentation,  once again that was
    not a ground to be pursued by Mr Khan.  As we have  identified,  noting
    the provisions of paragraph  339L(ii)  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  we
    concluded that the FtT was entitled to take into account the absence of
    any evidence other than  the  bare  assertions  about  the  appellant's
    father's arrest.  The ground discloses no error of law and  we  dismiss
    it.

15. In relation to the fourth ground, namely the guidance  set  out  in  KS
    (benefit of the doubt), once again, this is not a particularised ground
    and has no merit.  We have reviewed the findings at [16] to [27] of the
    FtT's decision, and it is clear that the FtT did not making findings in
    isolation and indeed in relation to [20],  which  was  the  subject  of
    particular challenge by Mr Khan as being inconsistent, the FtT  was  at
    pains  to   stress   that   some   inconsistencies,   when   considered
    individually, might not have merited adverse credibility findings,  but
    when considered in their wider context, they did so.

16. In relation to the more detailed second ground, it was  said  that  the
    FtT's findings were inconsistent and she had failed to  decide  whether
    photographic evidence was genuine or not.  It is worth repeating [20]:

         "I also find that the identifying apparent inconsistencies  in  the
         appellant's claim that he had transported some  political  material
         from Hallo are also insufficient  to  significantly  undermine  his
         claim on this matter per se,  but  in  light  of  the  evidence  of
         credibility findings and issues identified  with other  aspects  of
         his account I am not satisfied to the lower standard of proof as to
         the credibility of this aspect of his claim."

17. It was said that this was potentially inconsistent,  particularly  when
    FtT had said at [19] that the photographs may depict the  appellant  as
    engaging in illegal behaviour.

18. However, we do not regard [20] as inconsistent or that the FtT could be
    obliged to make any  definitive  finding  on  the  genuineness  of  the
    photographs.  The finding of inconsistencies in the  appellant's  claim
    has to be read in the context of earlier references to the respondent's
    refusal decision at [10], which in turn listed in detail at  paragraphs
    [38]to [39].  What the FtT did was to note the inconsistencies  in  the
    appellant's account; not dismiss the entirety  of  the  claim  on  that
    basis, but instead consider the inconsistencies in the  wider  context,
    including  photographic  evidence;  the  lack  of  evidence  about  the
    appellant's father's arrest;  the  fact  of  his  social  media  posts,
    despite claiming to fear for his family's safety; and the  plausibility
    of his account of how he fled Iran on  foot.   At  [18],  the  FtT  had
    merely concluded, as she was entitled to do, that the  photographs  may
    or may not  show  claimed  activities,  but  that  given  the  lack  of
    explanation of how they had  been  obtained;  and  the  fact  that  the
    locations were unclear and the photographs were undated,  she  attached
    little weight to them. That was an analysis which was  unarguably  open
    to her to make and discloses no error of law.

19. Where we do find there has been an error of law was the FtT's  analysis
    of the consequences of his social media posts.  While she was  entitled
    to find that they are motived solely by a desire to bolster his  asylum
    claim, and to find that the appellant would not be at  risk  solely  on
    account of exiting Iran illegally (see: SB (risk on  return  -  illegal
    exit) Iran CG [2009] UKAIT 0053) the combination of  illegal  exit  and
    sur place   activities, even if contrived, failed to take into  account
    the risk factors 5 and 9 of the HB (Kurds) Iran  authority.   Paragraph
    [5] reads:

         "Kurdish ethnicity  is  nevertheless  a  risk  factor,  which  when
         combined with other factors may create a real risk  of  persecution
         or Article 3 ill-treatment.  Being a risk factor means that Kurdish
         ethnicity is a factor of  particular  significance  when  assessing
         risk.  Those other factors will include the matters  identified  in
         paragraphs 6 to 9 below."

    Whilst we do not exclude consideration of other factors, paragraph  [9]
    in particular goes on to say:

         "Even low level political activity or activity that is perceived to
         be political such as or by way of example only, mere possession  of
         leaflets espousing or supporting  Kurdish  rights,  if  discovered,
         involves the same risk of persecution or Article  3  ill-treatment.
         Each case however depends on its own factors and an assessment will
         need to be made as to the nature of the material possessed and  how
         it would be likely to be reviewed by the Iranian authorities in the
         context of the foregoing guidance."

20. Ms Aboni accepts that the appellant will be returning,  as  someone  of
    Kurdish ethnic origin, without a passport.  In these circumstances,  he
    is likely to be at particular risk of questioning.  She  also  did  not
    dispute that he is likely to be asked whether  he  has  a  Facebook  or
    other social media account, which he does,  and  will  be  required  to
    disclose his password for those accounts, as part of  his  questioning.
    The FtT did not consider whether, if he has  posted  material  via  his
    Facebook account or google email  which,  even  if  contrived  for  the
    purposes of his protection claim, is highly critical of the Iran regime
    and its spiritual leader, whether that would place him  at  significant
    adverse risk. The FtT's failure to do so does, in our view, amount to a
    material error of law, such that the FtT's decision is unsafe and which
    we set aside.

Decision on error of law

21. The FtT's decision contained an error of law such that is necessary  to
    set it  aside.   In  doing  so,  however,  we  preserve  the  following
    findings: that whilst  the  appellant  is  of  Iranian  Kurdish  ethnic
    origin, but that he was  not  engaged  in  smuggling  and  distributing
    material for the KDP; and that he did not suffer adverse interest prior
    to leaving Iran, nor was such fear of  persecution  the  cause  of  his
    leaving Iran. In addition, the appellant had posted  material  via  his
    Facebook account, which even if since deleted has then been emailed  to
    him, which is highly critical of the Iranian state  and  its  spiritual
    leader.

The remaking decision

22. Given the narrowness of the factual and legal issues which needed to be
    remade, we regarded it as appropriate and in accordance  paragraph  7.2
    of the Senior President's Practice Statements that the  Upper  Tribunal
    remakes the decision on the appellant's appeal.

23. Mr  Khan  submitted  that  even  if  messages  via  social  media  were
    contrived, the appellant is of Kurdish ethnic origin; would most likely
    be questioned upon his return to Iran; and would be obliged to disclose
    his social media and email passwords,  which  would  reveal  the  anti-
    regime photos sent via email, even if deleted from the appellant's main
    Facebook account.

24. Ms Aboni accepted that the appellant continues to have a  Facebook  and
    email account. She did not refer  to  any  other  country  evidence  or
    guidance on the issue of contrived sur place activities.

25. We reviewed a number of the Facebook posts in the  appellant's  bundle,
    which had subsequently been  emailed  to  him,  including  at  [29],  a
    cartoon appearing to show Iran's spiritual  leader  being  pushed  into
    flames. Other  posts  ([23])  referred  to  the  'Islamic  republic  of
    bloodshed' taking the 'lives of Kurdish people'.  The posts,  which  we
    do not repeat in full, are highly critical  and  likely  to  be  highly
    inflammatory to supporters of the Iranian regime.

26. Noting the risk factors in HB, the  appellant  would  be  returning  as
    someone of Kurdish ethnic origin, without a passport.  On the one hand,
    he has not engaged in political activity, even low-level, in  Iran.  On
    the other hand, there is a risk, to the lower standard,  of  his  being
    questioned on his return, and being asked to disclose  his  Google  and
    Facebook account details; there is the risk of what HB referred to as a
    'hair trigger' approach: namely the threshold for suspicion being  low,
    and  the  reaction  of  the  authorities   being   extreme.    In   the
    circumstances, even where, as here, the material has  been  distributed
    for  the  purposes  of  bolstering  a  sur  place  claim,  we  have  no
    reservation in finding  that  the  Iranian  authorities'  view  of  the
    material we have seen would be extreme, given its inflammatory  nature.
    In the circumstances, the appellant does have a  well-founded  fear  of
    persecution and his return would risk his rights under articles 3 and 8
    being breached, the latter in terms of his inability to integrate  into
    Iran.

Remaking decision

27. We remake the appellant's appeal  by  allowing  his  appeal  on  asylum
    grounds.  We also conclude that his removal  would  breach  his  rights
    under articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR.

28. The appeal is refused on humanitarian protection grounds.
