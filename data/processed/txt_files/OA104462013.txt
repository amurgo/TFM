                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Jones made following a hearing at Bradford on 28th January 2014.



Background

 2. The Claimant is a citizen of  Pakistan  born  on  9th  May  1982.   She
    applied to come to the UK as a spouse but was refused  under  paragraph
    EC-P.1.1 of Appendix FM.  The Entry Clearance Officer stated  that  she
    had said that her Sponsor was self-employed as a  private  hire  driver
    since August 2010, but she did not state his gross income before tax in
    the  last  full  financial  year  and  did  not  submit  the  specified
    documents.  Many of the HMRC  documents  were  in  the  financial  year
    between 2010 to 2011 and she had only submitted two months of  personal
    bank statements.  In view of the fact that she  had  not  provided  the
    specified evidence for the specified period as stated in Appendix FM/SE
    of the Immigration Rules,  he  was  not  satisfied  that  she  met  the
    financial requirements.  The application was refused under paragraph EC-
    P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules E-ECP3.1.

 3. The judge recorded that it was the Sponsor's evidence that he had  been
    self-employed as claimed as a taxi driver earning �13,170 per annum and
    had additionally been employed part-time by S and J working as  a  rent
    collector and earning a gross income of �6,500 per annum.

 4. The judge said  that  the  Presenting  Officer  in  the  case  had  had
    oversight of the papers provided and, having considered them,  accepted
    that the only problem with the appeal was that some  of  the  Sponsor's
    income had not been paid into the bank by him.  There  were  additional
    documents relevant to the date of decision  in  the  Claimant's  bundle
    from his employers and from the accountant.

 5. The requirement of the Rules was that for the sums of money to be  paid
    into the bank account to avoid any suggestion that the  claimed  income
    was not in fact being earned.  The Sponsor's claims were not  disputed,
    and the judge understood that he might well not choose to  pay  all  of
    his income from this source into the bank, it being clearly outside his
    knowledge at the time that he should do so in order to comply with  the
    Rules. There was ample evidence of the claimed income and that  between
    the two incomes, for a sufficient period preceding the application, the
    financial requirements of the Rules were made out.

 6. The judge wrote as follows.

         "Mr Saleem noted the references made  by  Mr  Sobowale  as  to  the
         exacting requirements of the Rules.  Mr Saleem reminded me  of  the
         courts taking the view that this may be, to the extent of any  non-
         compliance here, to be unfair and unjust when there  is  plenty  of
         evidence which supports the claimed income.  Mr  Saleem  cited  the
         authority of MM and Others v SSHD [2013] EWHC 1900  submitting  the
         requirements of the Rule were  indeed  too  onerous  and  that  the
         sensible view here is that the claimed income relevant to  date  of
         decision has been made out on the balance of probabilities.   If  I
         were unable to find  for  the  Appellant  under  the  Rules  I  was
         reminded that the Sponsor is a  British  citizen  who  has  a  wife
         abroad, and that under Article 8 it would  be  disproportionate  to
         expect him to give up his life and work in the UK and join his wife
         in Pakistan in all the circumstances of this appeal."

 7. The judge then stated that on the totality of  the  evidence  he  found
    that the Appellant had discharged the  burden  and  standard  of  proof
    placed upon her in the proceedings.

    He wrote:

         "I make such finding  because  applying  the  appropriate  standard
         evidence that persuades me that at the relevant  time  in  question
         the Sponsor's income as claimed as a self-employed taxi driver  and
         part-time employment collecting rent were as claimed  and  met  the
         financial threshold required.  The Sponsor gave  credible  evidence
         which remained consistent and reliable to the appropriate  standard
         even though he was carefully and closely cross-examined.

         I am  also  against  the  appropriate  standard  persuaded  by  the
         credible and reasoned evidence of the Sponsor that he used the cash
         he was paid per month by S and J to save to send for  his  mother's
         use in Pakistan (�250) and the rest for his out of pocket  expenses
         and so no reason (then) to pay  this  into  his  bank  first.   The
         issues as to the slight omission do not negate my  overall  finding
         that the Sponsor's claimed income met the  Rules  at  the  time  of
         application bearing in mind the judgment of Blake J  paragraph  126
         in MM.

         Appeal allowed."

The Grounds of Application

 8. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that
    the judge had materially misdirected himself  in  law.   The  Rules  of
    specified evidence are comprehensively set out in Appendix FM/SE as  to
    what types of evidence are required, the periods  they  cover  and  the
    format they should be in.  The Tribunal had no regard to this  and  its
    findings are unsustainable.  Furthermore it is clear that the  Tribunal
    has not had appropriate regard to the relevant date.  For  Appendix  FM
    the significant date is the date of application not  the  date  of  the
    decision and the significant evidence  is  from  the  specified  period
    before that date.  It is not clear  what  the  Sponsor's  actual  gross
    income was at the date of application.

 9. It is implicit from paragraph 11 that by relying  on  MM  the  Tribunal
    accepts that the Appellant cannot satisfy the conditions of the  Rules.
    Whilst noting that MM is a persuasive authority the judgment  does  not
    dispute the Secretary of State's entitlement to set  a  minimum  income
    threshold with the aim of ensuring that those who  chose  to  establish
    their family life in the  UK  should  have  the  financial  ability  to
    support themselves and their migrant partner and do not become a burden
    on  the  tax  payer.   In  MM  the  judge  usurped  the  role  of   the
    democratically accountable decision maker in the formulation of  policy
    and had insufficient regard to the width of discretion afforded to  the
    Secretary of State  in  formulating  policy.   In  relying  on  MM  the
    Tribunal has erred likewise.  If  Mr  Justice  Blake  had  applied  the
    proper principles to his assessment of proportionality  he  would  have
    been compelled to the conclusion that the interference in the Article 8
    rights  of  applicants  and  their  families  caused  by  the  material
    provisions of the new Rules was  proportionate.   The  Rules  pursue  a
    legitimate aim and are rationally connected  to  that  aim  striking  a
    balance between the interests of applicants and their families and  the
    wider interests of society as a whole.   There  was  nothing  arbitrary
    about the balance struck by the Secretary of State and in relying on MM
    the Tribunal was relying upon an unsafe authority and  its  conclusions
    could not stand.

Submissions

10. Mrs Pettersen relied on her grounds and submitted  that  the  Appellant
    ought to have made a properly documented application.   The  judge  had
    not been clear as to whether the appeal  had  been  allowed  under  the
    Rules and his decision ought to be overturned.

11. Mr Saleem submitted that the Sponsor's income  on  self-employment  had
    been accepted by the Presenting Officer at the hearing.   With  respect
    to the second job, he had provided all of the  specified  evidence  set
    out in paragraph 2 of the "Evidence of  financial  requirements"  under
    Appendix FM save for 2(f),  namely  monthly  personal  bank  statements
    corresponding to the same period as the wage slips  at  paragraph  2(c)
    showing that the salary had been paid into an account in  the  name  of
    the person or in the name of the person and their partner jointly.  The
    judge had plainly been aware of what the issue in the  appeal  was  and
    had been satisfied that the income was as claimed.  Since the  Claimant
    met  the  substantive  requirements  of   the   Rules   it   would   be
    disproportionate to require her to make a further application.

12. By way of reply Mrs Pettersen submitted that the judge had not in  fact
    addressed the issue of proportionality, had not gone through the proper
    Razgar test and, as previously submitted, it was open to  the  Claimant
    to make a fresh application.

Findings and Conclusions

13. The reasoning in this determination is somewhat  opaque.   Nevertheless
    as the grounds acknowledge, it is implicit  that,  in  relying  on  the
    decision in MM the judge accepted that the Claimant could not meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

14. Paragraph 2(f) states that, in respect of salaried employment in the UK
    all of the following evidence must be provided, inter alia,

         "Monthly personal bank statements corresponding to the same  period
         as the wage slips at paragraph 2(c) showing  that  the  salary  has
         been paid into an account in the name of the person or in the  name
         of the person and their partner jointly."

15. The Sponsor accepts that he did not pay  the  second  salary  into  his
    account because he was unaware that  he  should  do  so.   He  did  put
    regular sums into the account but not the salary itself since  he  used
    some of the money for other purposes.  He  therefore  does  not  comply
    with  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  a  fact  clearly
    recognised by the judge.

16. Accordingly, although he did not spell it out, the  appeal  had  to  be
    dismissed under the Rules.

17. The grounds then attack the judge's reasoning with respect  to  Article
    8.  It is fair to say that the reasoning is  compressed.   Nevertheless
    it is clear what the judge's thinking was.  He was  entirely  satisfied
    that the substantive requirements of the Rules were  met.   It  is  not
    right to say, as the grounds do, that it is not clear  that  the  Rules
    were met during the specified period before the  date  of  application.
    Mrs Pettersen did not dispute Mr Saleem's submission that the P60,  the
    wage slips, the letter from the employer who issued the pay  slips  and
    the signed contract of employment, had  all  been  provided.   On  that
    basis the judge was entitled to conclude as he did that the substantive
    requirements of the Rules were met.

18. As the grounds acknowledge MM was a  persuasive  authority  before  the
    judge, and whilst the substance of that judgment deals with the  levels
    of maintenance required under the Rules, it was open to  the  judge  to
    cite it in support  of  his  conclusion  that,  since  the  substantive
    requirements of the Rules had been met, it  would  be  disproportionate
    for entry clearance to be refused.

Decision

19. The Claimant's appeal is dismissed  with  respect  to  the  Immigration
    Rules.  However, with  respect  to  Article  8,  the  judge's  decision
    stands.
