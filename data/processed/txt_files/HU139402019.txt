For the respondent:    Mr Esen Tufan, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the  First-
   tier Tribunal dismissing her appeal  against  the  Secretary  of  State's
   decision on 31 July 2019, refusing  her  application  to  remain  in  the
   United Kingdom on human rights grounds,  either  within  or  outwith  the
   Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended).

2. The appellant had a number of firms of solicitors representing her  since
   2014. In 2014, she instructed Syed Shaheen solicitors to submit  a  human
   rights application.  In 2015, she was represented by Bajwa &  Co  in  her
   second human rights application.

3.  Her  first  EEA  derivative  residence  card  application  in  2016  was
   submitted  by  A1  Law  Chambers,  from  whom  the  appellant's   present
   representatives, Bajaria Solicitors,  have  been  unable  to  obtain  any
   papers.  There was then a second derivative residence card application in
   2016, this time through  Londonium  Solicitors,  and  a  third  in  2017,
   through Law Dale Solicitors.

4. The appellant then instructed Barlow and Spencer  solicitors  to  make  a
   private and family life application in early 2017, but  by  October  2019
   the firm had closed down, taking with it an �1800 advance  payment  which
   the interveners did not repay to her.  On 3 January 2020,  the  appellant
   appeared before the First-tier Tribunal unrepresented.

5. Following the dismissal of  her  appeal,  the  appellant  instructed  her
   present firm, Bajaria Solicitors, who informed the Upper Tribunal  on  15
   April 2020 of her uncle's death, just over two weeks before it  occurred.
   They have  managed  to  assemble  a  significant  body  of  retrospective
   documentary evidence which has been of great assistance in mastering  the
   history of this appeal.

Background

6. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh, born on 16 June  1978,  so  she
   is now 42 years old. Her mother died in Bangladesh in August  2010,  just
   two months before the appellant received her Tier 4 visa  on  11  October
   2009, enabling her to come her to study for her  ACCA  examinations.  She
   has a large family in Bangladesh, a brother and five married sisters, all
   with their own households.

7. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 28 October 2009.  She  had
   leave to remain as a student continuously until it was  curtailed  on  10
   November 2014, when she was discovered to be working  in  breach  of  her
   visa conditions at a charity,  Help  for  Change  Trust.   The  appellant
   challenged that decision by judicial review at the time, arguing that she
   was merely volunteering, to build her social confidence.  Help for Change
   wrote a supporting letter confirming that, but the  judicial  review  was
   unsuccessful.

8. The appellant has had no extant leave now for over  6  years.   While  in
   the United Kingdom, the appellant has taken and passed almost all of  her
   ACCA examinations (see [13]-[14]  below).   In  2013,  her  studies  were
   interrupted by a road accident: she was run over,  and  her  ankle  badly
   fractured (an  open  distal  fibula  fracture).   The  appellant  is  now
   partially disabled. She had surgery, and owes the NHS a sum in excess  of
   �4000, which she has been repaying, initially at �100 per month,  now  at
   �10 per month.

9. Following her arrest on 10 November 2014, the appellant was  detained  at
   Yarls Wood until 8 December 2014.  When released, she did not embark  for
   Bangladesh, but remained in the United Kingdom, continuing from  time  to
   time to take and pass further ACCA examinations (without leave to do  so)
   and helping to care for her elderly uncle with whom she was  living,  who
   was recently divorced and had dementia, so needed a lot of personal care.



10. The uncle had a son, who divided his time  between  the  United  Kingdom
   and the United States (except this year, of course, due to  the  COVID-19
   pandemic).  The son visited his father twice a month on average, and  the
   uncle also had a privately employed carer who came every day, and a  care
   plan through Social Services.  The appellant's account was that  she  did
   everything else, to ensure high quality care for her uncle.

11. The appellant made applications for  leave  to  remain  on  12  November
   2014, just after her arrest, and  again  on  12  August  2015,  but  both
   applications  were  refused.   She  then  made  a  number  of  derivative
   residence card EEA applications in 2016, based on being her uncle's  non-
   EEA extended family member, the last of which was refused  on  8  October
   2018.

12. The present application was made on 5 November 2018, on Article  8  ECHR
   grounds, and refused on 31 July 2019.   The  appellant  appealed  to  the
   First-tier Tribunal, which dismissed  her  appeal.   The  appellant  then
   appealed to the Upper Tribunal.


ACCA examinations

13. The chronology prepared by the appellant's solicitors  and  Counsel  for
   the hearing  show  her  progress  towards  the  ACCA  qualification.  The
   appellant registered with ACCA on 12 July 2010.

14. My attention was not drawn to any evidence as to  how  many  papers  the
   ACCA requires students  to  pass  in  order  to  obtain  its  accountancy
   qualification, but the chronology shows that in the 10 years she has been
   in the United Kingdom, six of  them  without  leave,  the  appellant  has
   managed to pass  a  total  of  11  ACCA  papers,  5  of  them  after  the
   curtailment of her leave, presumably by self-study:

         Date              Paper
         December 2010          F1 - Accountant in business
         [At Brit College]      F2 - Management Accounting

                                    F4 - Corporate and Business Law
         June 2012                  F5 - Performance Management

         March 2019             SBL - Strategic Business Leader
         [No College named]

15. The appellant was due to sit her final  examinations  before  qualifying
   as an ACCA accountant on 8 December 2020, 6 days after the Upper Tribunal
   hearing.  I take judicial notice of her success over the previous  decade
   and accept Ms Naik's  submission  that  she  is  likely  to  be  a  fully
   qualified accountant at, or soon after, that date.

First-tier Tribunal decision

16. Before the First-tier Tribunal, the appellant appeared in  person.   Her
   appeal was firmly based on  her  uncle's  circumstances  and  her  caring
   responsibilities towards him.  First-tier  Judge  Sweet  considered  that
   there was a lack of documentary evidence about the arrangements made  for
   her uncle's care, noting that the uncle was about to have  a  fresh  care
   assessment and also received care from the State, as well as having a son
   who could help him and was United Kingdom-based.

17. The First-tier Judge did not accept that the appellant  was  paying  her
   NHS debt.  That is now accepted to have been an  error  of  fact  and  Mr
   Tufan does not seek to maintain that  position.    The  judge  considered
   that the appellant could complete her remaining few  papers  (perhaps  as
   few as two) in  Bangladesh,  or  remotely,  and  that  it  would  not  be
   disproportionate to expect her to do so.

18. The appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal.

Permission to appeal

19. The grounds of appeal, settled on 17 January 2020 by Ms  Miranda  Butler
   of Counsel, are prolix.  They are, however, summarised at [3]:

    "3.  In summary, the appellant appeals on the grounds that:

         a) The judge failed to assess the existence of family life  between
            herself and her dependent uncle [name] to make findings on  this
            part of her claim, or to give adequate  reasons  for  dismissing
            her appeal on these grounds;

         b)  The  judge  failed  to  take  into  account  relevant  evidence
            regarding the lawfulness of the curtailment of  the  appellant's
            leave [in 2014];

         c) The judge did not consider the appellant's  human  rights  claim
            with anxious scrutiny; and

         d) The hearing was procedurally unfair. "

20.  Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier   Judge   O'Brien,
   principally on ground (a), although he expressed concern  about  the  NHS
   point,  now  resolved.   No  ground   of   appeal   was   excluded   from
   consideration.

Rule 24 Reply

21. There was no Rule 24 reply on behalf of the respondent.

22. Triage directions were given on 19 June 2020  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
   Coker, and again on 7 September 2020 by Upper Tribunal Judge Owens.   The
   appellant has now instructed new representatives, Bajaria Solicitors, who
   notified the Upper Tribunal of the change of representation on 18 October
   2020.

23. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the  Upper  Tribunal.
   It was listed for a face to  face  hearing,  although  Ms  Naik  appeared
   remotely, by arrangement with the Upper Tribunal.

Documents before the Upper Tribunal

24. On 25 November 2020, Garden Court Chambers (where Counsel, Ms Naik,  has
   her Chambers), sent a lever arch  file  of  documents  for  the  upcoming
   hearing.    It  filled  a  lever  arch  file   and   was   not   supplied
   electronically.  As the documents  were  not  sequentially  numbered,  an
   alphanumeric system being used (A1, A2, B1 and so on) it is not  possible
   to say how many pages were in  the  bundle.  Fortunately,  the  documents
   therein contained were not novel in the context of these proceedings.

25. On 1 December 2020, the day before the hearing,  Ms  Naik  provided  the
   Tribunal with a skeleton argument and a chronology, which has  been  very
   helpful in getting a clear picture of what has happened over  the  decade
   that the appellant has been here.   I am grateful to her for the  breadth
   of her submissions, which were reinforced orally at the hearing.

Upper Tribunal hearing

26. By the time the appeal came before me,  there  had  been  a  significant
   change in circumstances.  The appellant's uncle, frail at  the  beginning
   of these proceedings, unfortunately died on 31 March  2020  of  COVID-19.
   His son, the appellant's cousin, inherited his house  but  chose  not  to
   live there.

27. The appellant's evidence is that her cousin has put  the  house  on  the
   market, but that in the meantime, she  has  been  permitted  to  continue
   living there, and to be joined by her partner, with whom until this  year
   she had been in a non-cohabiting relationship which began  in  2016.   He
   has a very good job, working for TATA Steel as  an  Associate  Consultant
   Software Engineer, and is earning �71,328 a year.  His visa allows him to
   have a dependant partner, who, if not  a  visitor,  may  switch  from  an
   existing status to that status of dependant.

28. The appellant now seeks to rely on the private and family life  she  has
   with her partner, rather than family life with her uncle.  The  Secretary
   of State has not had any opportunity to make a decision on  this  changed
   factual matrix.

Submissions

29. I have had regard to Ms Naik's submissions, both oral and  written,  and
   to those of Mr Tufan.

30. Ms Naik contends, dealing with the relationship  between  the  appellant
   and her uncle, that the First-tier  Judge's  failure  to  make  a  proper
   assessment of the level of the dependency of the appellant's  late  uncle
   on her, or her on the uncle, as contemplated in Kugathas v  Secretary  of
   State for the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 31, is a material error  of
   law in the First-tier Tribunal's decision, and that any  judge,  properly
   directing  himself  on  the  evidence  below,  and   making   appropriate
   adjustment for the appellant's limited ability to argue the point because
   she was unrepresented, would have concluded that there  was  family  life
   between appellant and uncle, which would have been  likely  to  make  her
   removal disproportionate.   Ms Naik contends that the uncle's death  does
   not make these arguments academic since materiality  is  to  be  assessed
   based on the evidence and circumstances at the date of hearing;

31. In relation to the 2014 curtailment, Ms Naik argued that the  judge  who
   then heard the matter failed to have proper  regard  to  the  appellant's
   evidence, supported by Help for Change Trust, that she was  not  working,
   but observing and socialising,  and  had  never  received  any  financial
   remuneration for anything she did there. Ms Naik relies on  Ahsan  v  The
   Secretary of State for the Home Department (Rev 1) [2017] EWCA  Civ  2009
   and Balajigari v The Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2019]
   EWCA Civ 673, arguing that the test in judicial review now is not whether
   the  Secretary  of  State's   decision   was   perverse   or   Wednesbury
   unreasonable, but rather, that a decision of precedent fact needs  to  be
   made in all cases  before  the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  can  be
   properly assessed and upheld or quashed.

32. Ms Naik accepted that such was not the legal  landscape  in  2014,  when
   the judicial review was decided.  However, she submitted that the  First-
   tier Judge should, of his own motion, have looked behind the decision  of
   the judicial review judge and considered  whether,  if  the  respondent's
   curtailment decision were challenged today, it would be  upheld.   If  it
   would not, then the First-tier Tribunal should  have  presumed  that  the
   appellant would have gone on  to  have  further  leave  to  remain  as  a
   student, and would eventually have achieved indefinite leave  to  remain.
   In that case, when making the proportionality assessment, the  weight  to
   be attached to the public interest  served  by  the  appellant's  removal
   would be manifestly diminished.

33. In the future, and despite her debt to the  NHS,  the  appellant  as  an
   accountant would be self-sufficient and no burden on public  funds.   She
   was able and willing in future to pay her NHS  surcharge,  either  as  an
   employed person by paying  tax  to  the  State,  or  as  a  self-employed
   accountant, possibly providing employment to others in the United Kingdom
   as well as herself.

34. The anxious scrutiny  element  of  the  claim  repeats  that  assertion,
   relying on R (YH) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2010]
   EWCA Civ 116.  The respondent should be required to give the appellant  a
   further 60 days now to find  a  new  Tier  4  sponsor,  alternatively  30
   months' discretionary leave to enable her to qualify for settlement,  'or
   to further regularise her situation such that she can apply  for  further
   leave in another capacity'.

35. On the question of procedural fairness, Ms Naik relied  on  the  judge's
   error on the NHS debt payment plan, on the Tribunal's duty  to  give  her
   every  assistance  as  an  unrepresented  litigant  (see  MNM  (Surendran
   guidelines  for  adjudicators)  [2000]  UKIAT  5   and   WN   (Surendran,
   credibility, new evidence [2004]  UKIAT  213),  and  to  take  notice  of
   medical evidence which the appellant had not  thought  to  bring  to  the
   hearing, having previously provided it to the  respondent,  which  showed
   that she had serious mental health problems and suicidal ideation.

36. Ms Naik invited me to allow the appeal. If the decision were to  be  set
   aside, the appellant would seek  to  introduce  further  evidence:   bank
   statements showing her NHS  debt  payments;  evidence  about  her  mental
   health, including the impact of losing her uncle;  an  updated  statement
   showing that she would complete her ACCA examinations on 8 December  2020
   and would then be a fully qualified accountant; and a statement from  her
   partner, showing that he had leave to remain in the United Kingdom as  an
   intra company transferee  and  could  support  and  accommodate  her,  if
   required.

37. For the respondent, Mr Tufan noted that this application had not been  a
   family life one, but had been based solely on private life, for leave  to
   remain outside the Rules.  It was right to say that there  was  reference
   to the appellant's uncle at part 6 of the application form.  There was no
   evidence before the First-tier Tribunal from the appellant's cousin,  her
   uncle's son, as to his own contribution to his uncle's welfare.

38. The curtailment was no longer open to challenge, having been  'done  and
   dusted' in 2014.  The appellant was asked at the hearing,  and  confirmed
   that judicial review of that decision had been refused.   Balajigari  and
   Ahsan were issue-specific and the Wednesbury principle in judicial review
   was not defunct, as Ms Naik appeared to be suggesting.

39. The NHS debt issue was not relied  upon  in  the  refusal  letter.   The
   judge had misdirected himself, but Mr Tufan accepted that  the  appellant
   was paying her debt.  That error of fact was  not  of  itself  sufficient
   reason to set aside the First-tier Judge's conclusions.  The decision  of
   the  First-tier  Tribunal  under  section  117B   of   the   Nationality,
   Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended)  was  sustainable,  and  had
   been open to the judge on the evidence and argument before him.

40. All of the other  issues  raised  post-dated  both  the  decision  under
   challenge and the First-tier Judge's decision and could not form a proper
   reason for concluding that the First-tier Judge made a material error  of
   law in his decision.

41. Mr Tufan asked me to uphold the decision of  the  First-tier  Judge  and
   dismiss the appeal.

Analysis

42. It is right to say that there is inadequate, if any,  reasoning  in  the
   First-tier Judge's decision on the Kugathas issue.  However,  that  error
   of law is not now a material error.  The caring relationship which is  at
   the heart of it has ended with the  uncle's  death.    Moreover,  on  the
   limited evidence presented about the rest of  the  caring  roles  in  her
   uncle's life, the date when he became divorced and needed family support,
   and his son's contribution, I am not as sanguine as Ms Naik is  that  the
   outcome would have been different had the judge applied his mind properly
   to whether there was family life between uncle and niece.

43. Nor do I  consider  that  the  error  of  fact,  patent  though  it  is,
   regarding the NHS debt is such as to make the First-tier Judge's decision
   unsound.  He was certainly wrong: the appellant had not brought with  her
   the  evidence  of  payment  and  he  jumped  to  conclusions.   But   the
   appellant's case was weak and would have failed for other reasons.

44. As  regards  the  judicial  review  issue,  Ms  Naik's  submissions  are
   unarguable.  It would be impossible, and improper,  to  proceed  in  this
   appeal as though the curtailment had not occurred, and then to  postulate
   various further extensions of student leave and eventual indefinite leave
   to remain, ending by directing the Secretary of State to take any of  the
   steps set out at [33] above.

45. The appellant had, and took, the opportunity to  judicially  review  the
   curtailment decision in 2014, based on the same  evidence  which  is  now
   produced.   She  was  unsuccessful.   There  have  been  five  subsequent
   applications for various types of leave in  the  meantime.   The  present
   application is not an application for an out of time appeal  against  the
   2014 judicial review decision, but an appeal  against  the  Secretary  of
   State's decision in an entirely different application.

46. The procedural fairness argument  is  equally  unsound.   The  appellant
   appeared unrepresented, although she had  previously  had  representation
   from a number of experienced immigration  firms.  She made her arguments,
   and the judge considered them in  the  light  of  the  evidence  actually
   produced.  It would be  impossible  for  the  judge  to  have  considered
   evidence which was not before him  and  unreasonable  to  expect  him  to
   deduce evidence of mental health issues, suicidal  ideation,  or  a  non-
   resident partner with whom she had been in a relationship since 2016,  if
   the appellant did not tell him of these matters.

47.  The  reference  to  the  Surendran  guidelines  cases  mistakes   their
   relevance.  These cases give guidance to judges as to how to proceed when
   faced with an appellant, but no  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer.   The
   Surendran guidelines tell a judge how to manage where he  does  not  have
   that assistance. That was not the situation here: there was a Home Office
   Presenting Officer before the First-tier Tribunal who was  able  to  test
   the appellant's evidence in the ordinary adversarial process.

48. I note that the appellant's argument before the  First-tier  Judge  that
   she would be unable to complete her ACCA qualification from Bangladesh is
   now irrelevant.  She has sat her final examinations and presumably is now
   a fully qualified accountant.  Additionally, it is  clear  that  she  has
   been able to take 5 of the 11 ACCA papers without attending any  College,
   either by self-study, or online course, or in some other manner which has
   not been explained.  If any retakes are  necessary,  she  could  do  that
   equally well from Bangladesh, as the First-tier Judge found.

49. Finally, I deal with the  appellant's  new  relationship  circumstances.
   The person with whom she has this relationship  has  not  been  mentioned
   before.  The Secretary of State has not had an opportunity  to  make  any
   decision on this situation and it is, of course, open to the appellant to
   make a paid application or further submissions and invite her to  do  so.
   The situation may be short lived, if the appellant's cousin, her  uncle's
   son,  finds  a  buyer  for  the  uncle's   house   swiftly.    In   those
   circumstances, the appellant will have no home in the United Kingdom.

50. For all these reasons, I conclude that  the  First-tier  Judge  did  not
   materially err in concluding that it would  not  be  disproportionate  to
   expect the appellant to embark for Bangladesh now,  after  spending  four
   years lawfully and six years unlawfully in the United Kingdom.

51. This appeal is dismissed.

DECISION

52. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

The making of the  previous  decision  did  not  involve  the  making  of  a
material error of law.

I do not set aside the previous decision.  The decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal is upheld.
