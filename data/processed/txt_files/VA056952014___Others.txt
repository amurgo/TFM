Representation:
For the Appellants:    No-one
For the Respondent:    Ms Z Ahmad, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are nationals of Pakistan born on  15th  February  1972,
    28th January 1977, 7th September 2007, 20th January  2003,  29th  March
    2000 and 9th April 2010  respectively.   The  First  Appellant  is  the
    husband of the  Second  Appellant  and  the  father  of  the  remaining
    Appellants.  They appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated
    14th August 2014 refusing them entry  clearance  to  visit  the  United
    Kingdom for a period of fifteen days.   Their  appeals  were  heard  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Swinnerton  on  8th  March  2016  and
    allowed in a decision promulgated on 16th March 2016.

 2. An application for permission to appeal  was  made  on  behalf  of  the
    Respondent.  Permission to appeal was granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Lambert on 8th August  2016.   The  permission  states  that  the
    judge's decision makes findings as  to  and  allows  the  appeal  under
    paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules.  It fails to take  into  account
    the restriction of this visit appeal to human rights grounds and  fails
    to make any findings relating to Article 8.

 3. There is no Rule 24 response.

The Hearing

 4.  There  was  no  appearance  by  the  Appellants'  Sponsor  or   by   a
    representative of the Appellants.  I  decided  to  go  ahead  with  the
    hearing based on the papers on file and hearing  submissions  from  the
    Presenting Officer.

 5. The Presenting Officer submitted that there are four matters raised  in
    the grounds of application for permission.  She submitted that on  25th
    June 2013 Section 52 of the Crime and Courts Act was commenced and this
    restricted the appeal  rights  for  visitors  coming  to  visit  family
    members  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The  restrictions  apply  to   any
    applications made on or after 25th June  2013.   This  application  was
    made in August 2014 and she submitted that there is therefore a limited
    right of appeal.  An appeal can only be brought on the residual grounds
    in Section 84(1)(b) and (c) of the 2002 Act namely on human rights  and
    race  relations  grounds.   She  submitted  that  family  visitors  are
    restricted to these two Grounds of Appeal and  the  judge  should  have
    known that.  She submitted that he was unable therefore to consider the
    merits of the case under paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules.

 6. She submitted that the second ground is that the judge failed  to  make
    findings on the Appellants'  human  rights  and  Section  117B  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  I was  referred  to  the
    case of Virk and Others [2013] EWCA Civ  652  at  paragraph  23.   This
    establishes that statutory jurisdiction cannot be conferred  by  waiver
    or agreement or the failure of the parties or the Tribunal to be  alive
    to the point.  She  submitted  that  the  judge  has  gone  beyond  his
    jurisdiction and has therefore erred in law and his decision should  be
    set aside.  She submitted that because there are  no  findings  in  the
    decision about Article 8 the judge was unable to allow the appeal.

 7. She submitted that if I find there to be a material error of law in the
    judge's decision I should remake the decision.  She referred me to  the
    case of Priscilla Adjei [2015] UKUT 0261 (IAC) which  is  on  the  same
    point.  She referred me to paragraphs  15  and  17  of  that  decision.
    These  deal  with  the  relationship  between   adult   relatives   and
    dependency.  She submitted that there is no evidence  to  suggest  that
    there is a stronger relationship than normal between the Appellants and
    the Sponsor which could mean that Article 8 is engaged and there is  no
    evidence of dependency by the Appellants on the Sponsor.  She submitted
    that it has been shown that the Appellants  can  finance  their  visit.
    The First Appellant is self-employed and she submitted that there is no
    dependency here.

 8. I was asked to find that Article 8 is not engaged and I  was  asked  to
    set the decision aside.

Decision and Reasons

 9. There is a clear material error of law in the judge's  decision  as  he
    had no jurisdiction to make  a  decision  under  paragraph  41  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  He did not take into account, the changes  made  by
    the Crime and Courts Act which amended Section 88A of the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as inserted by the 2006 Act, to  remove
    the right of appeal for  persons  visiting  specified  family  members,
    although there can be an appeal on residual grounds.

10. The judge's decision is based on paragraph  41  of  the  Rules  and  no
    consideration has been given to Article 8 of ECHR  which  is  the  only
    matter the Appellants could have succeeded on.

11. Based on what was before the judge I have considered Article 8 of ECHR.
     The judge made no decision about this.  There was no  evidence  before
    him that there was  anything  more  in  the  relationship  between  the
    Appellants  and  the  Sponsor  than  a  normal   relationship   between
    relatives.  The child Appellants are clearly dependent on their parents
    Appellants 1 and 2.  There is also no evidence of dependency.  It seems
    that there is no dependency as the  Appellants  applied  to  visit  and
    based on the evidence they supplied, they were able to afford to visit.

12. I have considered the said  case  of  Priscilla  Adjei.   There  is  no
    evidence of any particularly strong relationship between the  Appellant
    visitors and the Sponsor and their relationships can be  maintained  in
    the way relatives who have chosen to live in  different  countries  do.
    The UK Sponsor can visit the Appellants in Pakistan.  There is also  no
    evidence of sufficiently strong ties which would make this  claim  fall
    within the scope of Article 8.

Notice of Decision

There are clear errors of law in the judge's decision.  I  direct  that  his
decision is set aside.

Based on what  was  before  the  judge  I  am  re-making  the  decision  and
dismissing the appeals.

Anonymity has not been directed.
