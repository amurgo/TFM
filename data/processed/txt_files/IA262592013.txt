For the Respondent:    Miss Johnson, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant, Miss Sidra Nisar, date of birth 5th  March  1987,  is  a
    citizen of Pakistan.

 2. I have considered whether any of the parties to the present proceedings
    requires the protection of an anonymity direction.  Taking  account  of
    all the circumstances I  do  not  consider  it  necessary  to  make  an
    anonymity direction.

 3. The Appellant did not attend and there  was  no  attendance  by  anyone
    acting on her behalf.  By documents faxed to the  Tribunal  dated  12th
    June 2014 the Appellant has given instructions to Juris Solicitors that
    she wants the matter to be determined on the basis of the papers lodged
    with the Tribunal.  I determined to proceed and hear the appeal.

 4. This is the Appellant's appeal against a  determination  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge McMahon promulgated on 17th December 2013.

 5. By a decision taken on 28th March 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge P J  M
    Hollingworth determined that there was an arguable  error  of  law  and
    granted permission to appeal.  The reasons for the decision are:-

      i) An error of law  is  disclosed.   Article  8  was  not  considered.
         Plainly education is an important aspect of private life.

 6. In the permission granted there is no identification of any issue  with
    regard to the findings made by the judge under the  Immigration  Rules.



 7. The Appellant had entered  the  United  Kingdom  in  April  2011  as  a
    student.  Her leave was extended as a Tier 4 (General) Student  Migrant
    valid until August 2012.   The  Appellant  then  made  application  for
    further leave to remain as a student.

 8. In respect of the Immigration Rules the judge found at paragraph 8 that
    the bank statement submitted by the Appellant from her father, Mr Nisar
    Ahmed Baig, disclosed only �400  in  savings.   As  the  Appellant  was
    required to have �2,000 at least in order to meet the  requirements  of
    the Rules the judge found that the Appellant did not have the  required
    funds to meet the Rules.

 9. In the Grounds of Appeal it is suggested that  the  judge  should  have
    taken account of an affidavit from Mr Baig in assessing whether or  not
    the Appellant met the requirements of the Rules.  It  is  claimed  that
    the affidavit is sufficient to show that  Mr  Baig  had  the  funds  to
    support the Appellant.

10. The Rules require that the Appellant produces bank statements  to  show
    that she or her sponsor have the required funds. The Appellant has  not
    produced the bank statements  to  show  that  she  had  the  funds  and
    therefore does not meet the requirements of the rules. The Sponsor  did
    not have the funds in the bank account.  Thus the Appellant  could  not
    meet the requirements of the Rules.

11. It is suggested that the judge has failed to consider Article 8 private
    life.  With respect  that  seems  to  ignore  the  case  law.   I  draw
    attention to the case of Gulshan [2013] UKUT 640, Nagre [2013] EWHC 720
    and Haleemudeen [2014] EWCA Civ 558.  The cases make the point that the
    Rules are Article 8 compliant and that it would only be where the facts
    warrant consideration outside the rules under Article 8 that Article  8
    needs to be considered on the basis of Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.

12. In respect of the present circumstances the only factor that arises  is
    the issue of education.  As pointed out in the  case  of  CDS  (Brazil)
    [2010] UKUT 00305 (IAC) there is no Article 8  right  to  come  to  the
    United Kingdom to be educated.   Equally  it  is  questionable  whether
    there is a right to remain in the United Kingdom to continue to receive
    education where one does not meet the requirements of the Rules.

13. The Rules are there to provide a  means  by  which  an  individual  can
    remain in the United Kingdom  to  study  and  as  they  are  Article  8
    compliant provide for any right  to  continue  with  education.   There
    would have to be something exceptional within  the  facts  which  would
    justify consideration of the  case  outside  the  Rules  on  Article  8
    grounds.

14. The Appellant has not advanced any other element of family  or  private
    life that would engage Article 8.  The only factor  is  her  desire  to
    continue in education in the United Kingdom.  The Rules provide a means
    by which she could continue with her education but seek to ensure  that
    the Appellant  would  be  self-sufficient  in  seeking  to  pursue  her
    education.  Taking account of all the circumstances  there  is  nothing
    that warrants the consideration of the  Appellant's  case  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.  Accordingly there was no reason for  the  judge  to
    consider Article 8 outside the Rules.

15. Even if the judge had considered Article 8 outside the Rules the  facts
    as presented were  such  that  the  decision  would  in  any  event  be
    proportionately justified.

16. There was no aspect of family life that the Appellant raised.  Even  if
    private life were raised and the  decision  seriously  interfered  with
    that private life the decision is clearly in accordance  with  the  law
    and for the purposes of  maintaining  the  economic  wellbeing  of  the
    country.  The  issue  would  be  whether  or  not  the  decision  in  a
    democratic society is proportionately justified.  Taking account of all
    the facts I am satisfied that the decision is proportionately justified
    in any event.

17. Accordingly for the reasons set out there is no material error  of  law
    within the original determination.  I uphold the  decision  to  dismiss
    this matter on all grounds.
