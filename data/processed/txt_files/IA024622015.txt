Representation:

For the claimant: Mr R Rashid, instructed by Malik Law Chambers Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr J Parkinson, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Phull promulgated 18.5.15, allowing  on  both
    immigration and human rights grounds the claimant's appeal against  the
    decision of the  Secretary  of  State,  dated  8.1.15,  to  refuse  his
    application made in October 2014 for leave to remain the United Kingdom
    and to remove him from the UK pursuant to section 47 of the Immigration
    Asylum and Nationality  Act  2006.   The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    21.4.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Peart granted permission to appeal on 4.8.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 15.3.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out below, I found such error of law in the  making
    of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to require  the  decision
    of Judge Phull to be  set  aside  and  remade.  Having  set  aside  the
    decision, I heard further submissions, the parties affirming  that  the
    circumstances remain as they were at the time of the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal, and reserved my decision and reasons, which I  now
    give.

 5. The relevant background can  be  summarised  briefly  as  follows.  The
    claimant, a citizen of India, first came to the UK in 2012  with  leave
    as a Tier 4 student. He claims to have met his wife Simran,  a  British
    national, in 2013. Shortly prior to the expiry of his visa he submitted
    an application for leave to remain on the  basis  of  his  relationship
    with Simran. Before the matter was decided by the Secretary  of  State,
    they were married on 4.12.14. On 10.1.15 they  learnt  his  application
    had been refused.

 6. Judge Phull took into account that the claimant's wife was studying for
    a BTech and hoped to go on to university in September 2015,  for  which
    she had a conditional offer of a place at the time  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal appeal hearing. It was said that she could not go to live with
    the claimant in India as all her family are in the  UK  and  there  are
    language and cultural differences. She also plays cricket at  club  and
    county level, with a product sponsorship, and  has  ambitions  to  play
    internationally. It was also said that the claimant would  not  succeed
    in an out-of-country application for entry clearance as  a  spouse,  as
    his wife cannot satisfy the income threshold requirements.

 7. Judge Phull concluded that it would not be  reasonable  to  expect  the
    claimant's wife to leave the UK, given her strong ties to  the  UK  and
    her sporting achievements and then pending studies. The judge concluded
    that these amount to insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing
    outside the UK, under EX1 of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  The
    judge found that the  claimant  could  not  meet  paragraph  276ADE  in
    respect of private life, but  went  on  to  further  allow  the  appeal
    outside the Rules on the basis of private and family life  pursuant  to
    article 8 ECHR.

 8. It is not clear why, having allowed the appeal on immigration  grounds,
    the judge felt the need to consider the circumstances outside the Rules
    and further allow the appeal under article 8 ECHR.

 9. In summary, the grounds of application for permission to appeal  assert
    that the judge's approach to EX1 was flawed as the finding  that  there
    would be 'serious hardship'  under  EX2  was  based  on  an  inadequate
    assessment of the factual matrix.

10. The grounds  complain  that  at  �27  the  judge  considered  only  the
    sponsor's alleged difficulties in relocating to India,  without  giving
    any consideration at all to the option of  the  claimant  returning  to
    India for a short period of temporary separation in order  to  make  an
    entry clearance application, during which period he would  be  able  to
    remain in communication with the sponsor using modern technology. It is
    submitted that had the judge even considered this obvious solution  the
    basis for concluding that EX1 is met falls away.

11. In granting permission to appeal,  Judge  Peart  found  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge arguably erred  in  his  assessment  of  the  claimant's
    circumstances. "I bear  in  mind  that  he  did  not  engage  with  the
    possibility that the (claimant) could return  to  his  own  country  to
    apply for entry clearance from there. Although that evidence  came  out
    in cross-examination, the judge did not engage with it in weighing  the
    public interest and the proportionality of the (Secretary  of  State's)
    decision. See also Chen (Appendix FM - Chikwamba - temporary separation
    - proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC). "

12. The test under EX1 requires there to be 'insurmountable  obstacles'  to
    family life with the partner continuing outside  the  UK.  EX2  defines
    insurmountable obstacles as meaning the very  significant  difficulties
    which would be faced by the applicant or their  partner  in  continuing
    their family life together outside  the  UK  and  which  could  not  be
    overcome or would entail very serious hardship  for  the  applicant  or
    their partner.

13. In Agyarko & Ors, R (on the application of) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ  440
    the Court of  Appeal  held  that  where  a  party  who  had  overstayed
    unlawfully and married or formed a relationship with a British  citizen
    sought leave to remain,  the  "insurmountable  obstacles"  test  as  to
    return under the Immigration  Rules  was  a  stringent  test  and  more
    demanding than a mere test of whether it would be reasonable to  expect
    a couple to continue their family  life  outside  the  United  Kingdom,
    although the test was always  to  be  interpreted  in  a  sensible  and
    practical rather than purely literal way. Although  this  claimant  had
    not overstayed unlawfully, at the time of his application his leave was
    about to expire and he had no basis for continuing leave on the same or
    any  similar  basis  under  the  Rules.  His  immigration  status   was
    precarious and thus something more than reasonableness is required.

14. The matters set out by the First-tier  Tribunal  cannot  reasonably  be
    described as amounting to insurmountable  obstacles,  as  they  do  not
    create very significant difficulties which could not  be  overcome,  or
    which would entail very serious hardship. Neither relocating  to  India
    with the claimant nor the loss of opportunity for a potential career as
    a sportswoman, or university education, or product  sponsorship  cannot
    seriously be considered to be  in  the  same  league  as  very  serious
    hardship. In the circumstances the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    is in error of law and  cannot  stand.  The  appeal  should  have  been
    dismissed under the Immigration Rules.

15. On the facts of this case there was no basis for the judge to go on  to
    consider family or private life outside  the  Rules  on  the  basis  of
    article 8 ECHR. As the case law now makes clear, only where  there  are
    compelling circumstances insufficiently recognised in the Rules can  it
    be justified to go on to consider private or family  life  outside  the
    Rules.

16. Where someone from the United Kingdom marries  a  foreign  national  or
    establishes  a  family  life  with  them  at  a  stage  when  they  are
    contemplating trying to live together in the United Kingdom,  but  when
    they know that their partner does not have a future right to remain  in
    the UK, the relationship will have  been  formed  under  conditions  of
    known precariousness and it will be appropriate to identify  compelling
    circumstances before a violation of Article 8 will be found to arise in
    relation to a refusal to grant leave to remain outside the Rules.

17. In SS (Congo) and Others [2015] EWCA Civ 387 the Court of  Appeal  held
    that even though a test of exceptionality does not apply in every  case
    falling within the scope of Appendix FM, it is accurate to say that the
    general position outside the sorts  of  special  contexts  referred  to
    above is that compelling circumstances would need to be  identified  to
    support a claim for grant of leave to remain outside the new  Rules  in
    Appendix FM.

18. On the facts of this case I find that  there  are  no  such  compelling
    circumstances and that the First-tier Tribunal has failed  to  identify
    any such. That she would have to  forego  her  potential  career  as  a
    sportswoman, or lose any sponsorship deal, or be unable to embark on or
    complete education in the UK are not  compelling  circumstances.  There
    was thus no basis for going on to consider article 8 ECHR  outside  the
    Rules. Article 8 is not a general dispensing power for those who do not
    meet the Rules. In the circumstances, the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is in error of law and cannot stand.

19. However, I am satisfied  that  even  if  it  had  been  appropriate  to
    consider family life outside  the  Rules,  that  there  was  absolutely
    nothing disproportionate in the refusal decision on the facts  of  this
    case as outlined in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

20. I note that the judge appears to have taken no account of the fact that
    the Rules, including Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE are the Secretary
    of State's response to private  and  family  life  claims.  Any  Razgar
    proportionality  assessment  must  bring  into  the  balance  that  the
    claimant cannot meet the Rules, and that it  remains  open  to  him  to
    return to India to make application for settlement, in accordance  with
    the Rules. The Rules provide for those in the claimant's  circumstances
    both from within the UK and  in  applications  made  from  outside  the
    Rules. The fact that the sponsor may not be able to meet the  financial
    requirements on any such application has been held to be not a relevant
    consideration. See also Sabir (Appendix FM - EX.1  not  free  standing)
    [2014] UKUT 00063 (IAC).

21. I also note that in making the article 8 proportionality assessment the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge misapplied section  117B  of  the  2002  Act.
    Whilst at �34 the judge accepted that immigration  control  is  in  the
    public interest, the judge fails to take account of the fact  that  the
    claimant's immigration status was at all times precarious and  thus  no
    weight should be given to any private life developed in the UK.

22. The judge also gave credit to the claimant for  his  ability  to  speak
    English "so there is no additional public interest in removal."  As  AM
    (Malawi) [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC) made clear an applicant can  obtain  no
    positive right to  remain  from  the  fact  he  speaks  English  or  is
    financially independent. Further, as the sponsor is a student  and  the
    claimant is unable to work, the  decision  contains  no  assessment  of
    financially independence, when the Tribunal  is  required  to  consider
    that it is in the public interest that persons seeking to remain should
    be financially independent.

23. It  is  clear  that  the  claimant  and  his  partner  entered  into  a
    relationship when that precariousness was known  and  he  had  no  real
    basis for seeking leave to remain and did not pursue further leave as a
    student. Thus the claimant and his partner took  the  very  significant
    risk that he may not be able to remain, in the hope that  he  could  be
    permitted to remain on a basis entirely outside the Rules.  He  is  not
    entitled to settle in the UK simply because that is his choice, or even
    because he has married a British citizen. Article 8 is not a  short-cut
    to compliance with the Immigration Rules.

24.  Taking  everything  into  account  in  the  round,  as  a  whole,  the
    circumstances of the claimant and his partner when balanced against the
    legitimate and necessary aim to protect the economic well-being of  the
    UK do not outweigh that public interest. In reaching that conclusion, I
    bear in mind that it remains open to the claimant to  return  to  India
    and seek entry clearance as partner. That there are Rules for those who
    wish to settle in  the  UK  with  a  British  partner  renders  it  not
    unreasonable to expect him to do so,  and  thus  it  follows  that  the
    decision  of  the  Secretary   of   State   cannot   be   regarded   as
    disproportionate to the claimant's rights to respect  for  private  and
    family life.

Conclusions:

25. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

     I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
