For the Appellant:     Mr Adjarho of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Whittwell a Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background


    1. The Respondent decided to deport the Appellant on 12 September  2014
       by virtue of s32  (5)  of  the  UK  Borders  Act  2007  due  to  her
       conviction and sentence of 5 � years in jail for her involvement  in
       the importation of �264,000 worth of Class A drugs. She was born  on
       3 August 1980 and is now 35 years old.
    2. Her  appeal  against  that  decision  was  dismissed  by  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Cohen  following  a  hearing  on  2  September  2015.
       Following a hearing on 7 March 2016 I set aside the  decision  as  I
       was not satisfied that the Appellant in Jamaica or her  family  here
       had been notified of the date time and  venue  of  the  hearing  and
       there had been an inadvertent material error law for which no  fault
       attached to Judge Cohen. No findings  were  preserved.  This  appeal
       before me was therefore against the Respondent's original decision.

The law


    3. In deportation appeals, the burden of proof is on the Respondent  to
       show that on the balance of probabilities the Appellant is in law  a
       member of the class of people liable for deportation.

    4. In human rights appeals, if it is established that there is  a  real
       risk that there will be an interference with the  Appellant's  human
       rights and  the  relevant  article  permits,  it  is  then  for  the
       Respondent to establish that the interference is justified.

    5. In assessing the evidence a great many cases provide guidance on how
       the risk is to be assessed.  I remind myself of  the  methodological
       guidance set out in Karanakaran v SSHD [2000] 3 AII ER 449 and  bear
       in mind the words of Scott Baker J that:

         "...great care must be taken  before  making  adverse  findings  of
         credibility in asylum cases.  They should of course  only  be  made
         when they are justified in the light of the  circumstances  of  the
         particular case under consideration" (Befekadu CO/4585/97).

    6. The deportation case law is perhaps best summarised in KMO  (section
       117 - unduly harsh) Nigeria UKUT 00543 (IAC), Chege (section 117D  -
       Article 8 - approach) [2015] UKUT 00165 (IAC), YM  (Uganda)  v  SSHD
       [2014] EWCA Civ 1292, MAB (para 399; "unduly harsh") USA [2015] UKUT
       00435 (IAC), McLarty (Deportation - proportionality balance)  [2014]
       UKUT 00315 (IAC), SSHD v AQ (Nigeria), CD (Jamaica), TH (Bangladesh)
       [2015] EWCA Civ 250, LC (China) v SSHD [2014]  EWCA  Civ  1310,  and
       Masih (deportation - public interest -  basic  principles)  Pakistan
       [2012] UKUT 00046 (IAC) which between them summarise the  vast  body
       of jurisprudence. I will apply  in  the  determination  of  evidence
       section the principles derived from them.

    7. I have applied R (app RK) v SSHD (s117B(6) "parental  relationship")
       IJR [2016] UKUT 00031 (IAC) and Treebhawon and  others  (s  117B(6))
       [2015] UKUT 00674 (IAC), and  with  regards  to  Article  8  I  have
       particularly applied Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27,  Beoku-Betts  v  SSHD
       [2008] UKHL 39, ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4, Patel & Others  v  SSHD
       [2013] UKSC 72, and �ner v Netherlands (App no 46410/99) ECHR  which
       between them summarise the vast body of jurisprudence. I will  apply
       in the determination of evidence section the principles derived from
       them.


    8. I have applied paragraph 398, 399, and  399A  of  the  Statement  of
       Changes in Immigration Rules HC395.

    9. I am concerned with the Grounds of Appeal specified in Section 84 of
       the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 act"). I
       have applied in particular  s55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
       Immigration Act 2009, and s117A-D of the 2002 act.

   10. I heard oral evidence from the Appellant's mother Andrea Gregwah and
       husband Basil Allen, and submissions from both representatives which
       are fully set out in the Record of Proceedings. I  have  also  taken
       into account all the information placed before me. I summarise  here
       what I consider to be  the  most  relevant  parts  of  the  law  and
       evidence  for  the  purpose  of  his  appeal.  I  will  not  include
       repetition. The fact that I have not included every word stated does
       not mean that I have excluded  it  from  my  consideration.  At  the
       commencement of the hearing I explained the procedure in  Court.  At
       the end of the hearing I reserved my determination which I now  give
       with reasons.

Appellant's position


   11. The Appellant arrived on 15 December 1993 and  was  given  6  months
       leave to enter as a visitor until June  1994.  It  appears  that  in
       September 2002 she was granted indefinite leave to remain under  the
       7 year child concession policy. She married Basil on 31 August 2002.
       They had a child called Kari who was born on 24 July 2009 and is now
       almost 7. She is a British citizen.


   12. In the application Andrea made for  permission  to  stay  (11  April
       2000) it was identified that the Appellant had a sister Claudia  who
       had a twin brother Christopher who are both now aged 31, and another
       set of twin brothers Simon and Courtney who are both  now  aged  23.
       Andrea, Simon, and Courtney are now British citizens. Basil is  not.
       He is a Jamaican citizen.


   13. When sentencing the Appellant,  the  Judge  stated  that  it  was  a
       serious offence. Her role was a significant one. She was not  acting
       under duress. She fully knew what she was doing, took  a  risk,  and
       was caught.


   14. In the questionnaire (17 December 2012) the Appellant said that  she
       was born at St Catherine's in Spanish Town in Jamaica. Her father is
       dead. Everyone helps out with Kari to ensure Andrea  gets  a  break.
       Andrea took Kari to prison every week.  She  and  her  family  write
       letters to each other. She  has  already  lost  2  children  and  is
       finding it very hard to live without Kari.


   15. In her solicitor's letter (17 January 2013)  it  is  said  that  she
       cannot return to Jamaica given her family life here, and her  strong
       local cultural and social ties. She cares for  her  grandmother  who
       has dementia. Andrea has severe problems with her blood and  ongoing
       stress and depression.


   16. In her solicitor's letter (12 June 2013) it is said that Kari  lives
       with Andrea. Basil spends time with her at the weekends and a couple
       of nights during the month. They plan to live together as  a  family
       unit at  the  end  of  the  custodial  sentence.  Basil  has  health
       problems.


   17. In her letter (8 March 2016) she said she regrets her  actions  from
       May 2012. She has no friends or family in Jamaica. She has  to  keep
       moving as she has no money. She has no job. Andrea  and  Basil  send
       �100 when they can. She goes hungry most nights.  She  misses  Kari.
       Andrea's illness is getting worse. She misses Basil.  She  has  hurt
       all of them. She wants her family back.


   18. In her statement (6 April 2016) Andrea said  that  she  is  54.  The
       Appellant was deported on 6 November 2014 having arrived  here  when
       she was 13. She was granted leave to remain in September 2002. Until
       she was jailed, the Appellant was the carer of her  (i.e.  Andrea's)
       mother. It would be unfair for the family to move to Jamaica as  all
       the children had their formative periods  here.  Basil  was  granted
       indefinite leave to remain in April 2014. She struggles to cope with
       Kari given her (i.e. Andrea's) health. Kari cries nearly  all  night
       and wants her mother back. She can no longer cope  with  caring  for
       Kari. Basil cannot care for her given his job. It is in Kari's  best
       interest for the Appellant to come back. She (i.e.  Andrea)  had  to
       stop working as a catering manager 8 years ago on  medical  grounds.
       The Appellant is destitute and lives from hand to  mouth  and  moves
       around. She is virtually living on the street.


   19. In evidence she added that she speaks to the Appellant once or twice
       a week. She is a bit worried. She saw a picture of  Kari  and  could
       not believe how she had grown. She sent money last Friday to  enable
       her to buy food. Claudia lives in Spanish Town  with  her  boyfriend
       and child in a 2 bedroom house. The Appellant spent 2  or  3  months
       with her after she arrived in Jamaica.  She  (i.e.  Andrea)  was  at
       court when Claudia was sentenced  and  also  gave  evidence  at  the
       deportation hearing. Simon has just finished university and works at
       the same photography agency as Courtney who has a diploma and  is  a
       photographer. Christopher works at McDonalds.   She  tries  to  send
       between �60 and �90 a month to Jamaica. Basil tries to send  roughly
       �100 per month but sometimes less. The others do  not  really  help.
       The Appellant is renting a room in Mandeville. She (i.e. Andrea) was
       in Jamaica last year after her mother died. She did not take Kari as
       she (i.e. Andrea) was unwell and Kari has just settled and would  be
       upset.  Kari  does  not  live  with  Basil  he   lives   in   shared
       accommodation. Even if the Appellant came back Kari would stay  with
       her (i.e. Andrea) for a while until she adjusted  properly  to  her.
       The last time they saw each other was when she was 3  just  1  month
       before the Appellant was deported. She does not use  Skype.  Claudia
       is a fitness instructor. It is a 1 �  drive  from  Spanish  Town  to
       Mandeville and costs $1,500 Jamaican which is �2 or �3 bus fare.


   20. In his letter (12 June 2013) Basil said he is a chef in a care home.
       He stopped seeing her in prison because of the effects on the family
       including Kari who misses her mother. He is waiting for an operation
       on his knee.


   21. In his statement (24 May 2016) he said that they had  another  child
       who died at birth in 2000. He had no leave  from  1997  to  November
       2007. The Appellant  has  been  punished  for  her  crime.  She  has
       promised to receive counselling and is very remorseful. Kari  misses
       her and cries on the phone. He had a knee operation in 2013 and  has
       pains in his hip. He cannot care for Kari alone. He lives in  shared
       accommodation.


   22. In evidence he added that he spoke to the Appellant  last  Saturday.
       Kari speaks on the phone to her and uses Skype as often as  she  can
       which can be 3 or 4 times in a day. He sends her monthly  about  �70
       to �120. He went to Jamaica in 2011  and  2012  and  stayed  with  a
       friend on his mother's side. He has no family in Jamaica.


   23. I have seen  his  status  letter,  Jamaican  passport,  contract  of
       employment, payslips for 2010/11,  details  regarding  physiotherapy
       outpatient appointments and x-rays in 2013, details of  tax  credits
       paid to the Appellant and Basil in 2010, and a list of prison visits
       from him from October 2012 to June 2014 when he visited 15 times  in
       that 19 month period.


   24. I have seen evidence of  Andrea's  ill-health  regarding  her  blood
       platelet problem, the medication she receives, and the  difficulties
       she has which include bleeding, headaches, and a chest rash.


   25. The determination regarding Claudia (IA/03788/2007), heard on 16 May
       2007, notes that she entered the United Kingdom on 1  December  1996
       and was given leave to remain on 30 July 2002 under  the  concession
       that applied to children under the age of 7.  On  20  November  2006
       she was convicted of the importation of in excess of 20 kg of herbal
       cannabis with a street value of �50,000. Each  member  of  Claudia's
       family gave evidence and gave clear and  cogent  statements  to  the
       effect that  that  they  had  a  close  relationship  and  would  be
       devastated if she was compelled to return to Jamaica. Andrea's state
       of health was also noted. The Tribunal dismissed the appeal.

Respondent's position

   26. The offence for which she was jailed was serious as reflected in the
       Judge's sentencing remarks. The Respondent gives significant  weight
       to protecting society against  crime  and  disorder  and  protecting
       health and morals. Her deportation is conducive to the public  good.
       She has not demonstrated that she is not a danger to the community.


   27. There are no very compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those
       described in the exceptions to deportation as set out in  the  rules
       at paragraphs 399 and 399A.


   28. It is not accepted that she has a genuine  and  subsisting  parental
       relationship with Kari. They were separated  when  she  was  just  3
       years old. There are no concerns about the ability  of  her  carers.
       There is no evidence to demonstrate it will be unduly harsh for Kari
       to remain here without her. The Appellant's presence is not required
       to prevent Kari from being ill treated, or to ensure her  health  or
       development are not impaired,  or  to  provide  her  with  safe  and
       effective care. The negative emotional impact will  be  set  against
       the fact that she will continue to  live  with  her  family  and  be
       supported through her schooling. Contact could continue with  visits
       to Jamaica.


   29. It will not be unduly harsh for Kari to live with  her  in  Jamaica.
       She has Jamaican heritage and is young enough to adapt to life there
       where the Appellant herself lived until she was 13. There would  not
       be social or cultural barriers and she speaks English which  is  the
       official language used.


   30. She has a subsisting relationship with Basil. It was formed when his
       immigration status was precarious as he arrived in United Kingdom in
       1996 and had no leave to remain from July 1997 to November 2007.  It
       would not be unduly harsh for Basil to live in Jamaica as  he  lived
       there until he was 21 and is a Jamaican national. It  would  not  be
       unduly harsh for Basil to remain here without her given  the  nature
       of her crime which outweighs the rights they are  entitled  to  with
       respect their family life.


   31. She has not been lawfully here for most of  her  life.  She  had  no
       leave to remain from June 1994 to November  2002  and  only  arrived
       when she was 13. She was in jail for a serious offence. There are no
       very significant obstacles to her  integrating  to  Jamaica  as  she
       lived there until she  was  13,  speaks  the  official  language  of
       English, can  seek  support  from  relatives,  and  can  use  skills
       acquired here to work.


Determination

   32. I accept that the Appellant has the recorded conviction and received
       a sentence in excess of 4 years.  She  falls  within  the  automatic
       deportation provisions given the length of the sentence and  outside
       the scope of paragraphs 399 and 399A of the immigration rules.


   33. The Judge made clear in his sentencing comments that  the  Appellant
       had a significant role in the offence and knew exactly what she  was
       doing.


   34. The Appellant knew  the  consequences  of  her  actions  before  she
       committed the offence because her sister Claudia  was  deported  for
       the same type of offence. The only difference between them was  that
       the Appellant was importing class A drugs of a higher  street  value
       than Claudia who was importing  cannabis.  The  Appellant  knew  the
       destruction of her family life  that  would  follow  should  she  be
       caught given the evidence in Claudia's case and the deportation that
       followed, and the destruction of other families and communities that
       would follow through the distribution of the Class A  drugs  if  she
       was not caught. Within the  context  of  that,  her  remorse  sounds
       extremely hollow.


   35. There is a strong public interest in the  Appellant  being  deported
       given the serious nature of the offence, the significant  impact  it
       could have caused on others and society, the importance of deterring
       others from committing  such  a  crime,  and  as  an  expression  of
       society's  condemnation  of  this  serious  criminal  activity.  The
       offence was not committed whilst the Appellant was a juvenile but  a
       mature adult of then 31 years old who did so  in  the  knowledge  of
       exactly what would happen to her should she be caught because of her
       own personal family circumstances namely Claudia's deportation.  She
       did of course also have a poor immigration history.


   36. There are various strands to her family  life  claim  which  I  must
       consider in deciding whether removal would be contrary to  her,  and
       the various people she  identifies  as  family  members,  Article  8
       rights. I bear in mind the importance of family life,  the  fact  it
       takes many forms, the fact that people do not have to live  together
       to have a family life, and the positive duty to promote it.  I  bear
       in mind that I must consider family members to be victims.

   37. The Appellant has been deported to  Jamaica.  She  has  been  living
       there  now  for  18  months.  There  is  no  cogent  independent  or
       documentary evidence of any health problems. She was  able  to  stay
       with Claudia for 2  or  3  months  on  arrival  in  Jamaica  and  is
       regularly receiving money from family in the United Kingdom. She has
       accommodation and is not homeless. There  is  access  to  technology
       because she is able to speak to her family here once or twice a week
       and sometimes a number of times a day.  She can buy  paper  and  use
       the postal service because she was able to send a letter.


   38. The fact that Basil has chosen not to return to Jamaica to  be  with
       her is a matter for him. He is a Jamaican citizen  who  lived  there
       until he was 21 and lived here without any leave for about 10 years.
       He speaks the language and understands the culture  in  Jamaica  and
       could work there as he has skills. He would have family support  and
       has friends he can stay with. He has been there recently  twice  but
       has chosen not to go there since the Appellant was deported. He  can
       visit whenever he wants. If the relationship was currently  of  such
       significance to him he would go to Jamaica to be with her. I bear in
       mind that their relationship was formed (around 2000)  when  neither
       of them had leave to remain and their status was both  unlawful  and
       precarious.


   39. The fact that he and Andrea have chosen not to allow Kari to  go  to
       Jamaica to be with or see the Appellant is a matter for  them.  They
       are acting in what they consider is in Kari's best interest.


   40. It is not unduly harsh for Kari to stay here with Andrea  and  Basil
       without the Appellant for the following reasons. Kari was  separated
       from the Appellant due to the Appellant's  choice  when  she  was  3
       years old. The Appellant knew that that would be the consequence  of
       her action and made that choice. She has failed  to  establish  that
       she has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with Kari  as
       she has not seen her since she was 3, Kari has not been taken to see
       her, and there  is  no  evidence  she  has  any  role  in  decisions
       affecting Kari's life either on a daily or general  basis.  Kari  is
       being cared for by Andrea. There is no independence cogent  evidence
       to suggest that she has suffered in any  way.  She  has  appropriate
       housing and schooling. She  sees  her  father  and  extended  family
       members. She is no doubt showered with love and attention. There  is
       no report from social services, the school, or GP  to  indicate  any
       problem whatsoever.  I  do  not  accept  that  the  Appellant  is  a
       significant feature in her life because of  the  inevitably  limited
       relationship they have through modern  means  of  communication  and
       lack of direct contact since Kari was 3. That  was  the  choice  the
       Appellant made when she committed the offence the  result  of  which
       she knew would happen.


   41. It is in Kari's best interest to remain in the United Kingdom  given
       she is British and settled here at that school and has family around
       her. As will be seen shortly that does not however mean it would  be
       unduly harsh for her to leave the United  Kingdom  to  be  with  her
       mother in Jamaica if that was what the family thought was best.


   42. Whilst I note the Respondent's position that it is  in  Kari's  best
       interests for the Appellant to return to the United Kingdom,  it  is
       Andrea's position that the current living arrangements would remain.
       In the absence of independent evidence of the damage caused to  Kari
       by living with a convicted drug smuggler, it is by  no  means  clear
       that it is in Kari's best interests to live with the Appellant given
       the  destruction  to  families  (whether  her  own  or  others)  the
       Appellant chose to embark on by her involvement in the  drugs  trade
       in the knowledge of what would happen should  she  be  caught.  That
       cavalier attitude to relationships will inevitably weigh heavily  on
       the minds of social workers conducting the assessment of who  it  is
       best for Kari to live with and what contact she should have with the
       Appellant.


   43. Basil complains that his knee problem affects his  ability  to  care
       for Kari. The medical evidence falls woefully  short  of  suggesting
       that.  He  also  identifies  his  living   arrangements   and   work
       commitments as a reason Kari cannot live with him. I do  not  accept
       that either of those would prevent living with him as there are many
       single parents who work and provide accommodation for themselves and
       their child. I am satisfied as it is a  matter  of  choice  that  he
       chooses to play a secondary role in her life.


   44. Andrea complains that her health problem affects her ability to care
       for Kari. The medical evidence falls woefully  short  of  suggesting
       that as there is no independent report from  the  doctor  suggesting
       that her health could affect her childcare to any significant extent
       and no independent evidence from a  social  worker  suggesting  that
       Kari has been affected by Andrea's health or indeed  for  any  other
       reason. There is  no  evidence  from  the  school  to  indicate  any
       problems Kari is having. I only have the  word  of  the  family  and
       given the  absence  of  cogent  independent  evidence  reject  their
       concerns as being unfounded embellishment.


   45. It would not be unduly harsh for any of them to  return  to  Jamaica
       because Claudia has proved that work is available,  a  life  can  be
       made there, and a family brought up there. It would  not  be  unduly
       harsh for Kari to go there because she  plainly  has  family  there,
       speaks the language, could go to school, and is of Jamaican heritage
       as both of her parents are Jamaican.


   46. The Appellant had not been here lawfully for most of her  life.  She
       is 35 years and 9 months old. She spent 13 years  and  4  months  in
       Jamaica and the last 2 years and 6 months there. That is a total  of
       15 years and 10 months. She had no leave to be here from  June  1994
       to September 2002. That is 8 years and 3 months. She only had  leave
       to be here for 6 months at the beginning of 1994 and  for  12  years
       and 2 months from September 2002. That is a total of 12 years and  8
       months which is significantly less that 17 years and 10 months (that
       being half of her life). Given her failure to comply with  the  drug
       or immigration  laws  in  the  United  Kingdom  she  has  failed  to
       establish she is socially or culturally integrated here.


   47. For all the reasons I have given I am not satisfied that  there  are
       any compelling circumstances let alone very compelling circumstances
       that go above and beyond those falling within paragraph 399 and 399A
       of the immigration rules when taking into account  the  factors  set
       out in section 117B. Indeed, all of the factors weigh  very  heavily
       against the Appellant being allowed to return.


Decision:

      I set aside the decision of the 1st tier tribunal.

         I dismiss the appeal against the deportation order on all grounds.
