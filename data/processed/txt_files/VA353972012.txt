Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms C Simpson, instructed by Stewart & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant, a Nigerian citizen  resident  in  Spain,  was  born  on  6
   September 1965. He has  been  given  permission  to  appeal  against  the
   determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Bartlett dismissing his appeal
   against the respondent's decision to refuse entry clearance to the United
   Kingdom as a family visitor.

2. The appellant applied for entry clearance to  the  United  Kingdom  as  a
   family visitor, on 23 July 2012, stating in his application form that  he
   intended to stay in the UK for one week,  to  see  his  fianc�e  and  his
   daughter. He would be staying with his fianc�e, Amako Ekwo, for one week.
   He stated that he resided in Spain  and  was  employed  full-time  as  an
   assistant clerk in a company called Suiqas SL.

3. The respondent refused the appellant's application on  the  grounds  that
   it was not accepted that he intended to leave the United Kingdom  at  the
   end of his visit and it was not  accepted  that  he  could  maintain  and
   accommodate himself without recourse to public funds  or  that  he  could
   meet the cost of his return trip.  The  respondent  referred  to  various
   discrepancies in the appellant's evidence which led to doubts  about  his
   employment and about his income and  financial  circumstances.  Reference
   was also made to the absence of evidence from his ex-wife confirming that
   she was expecting his visit.

4. In his Notice of Appeal the appellant indicated that he did  not  require
   an oral hearing of his appeal. His appeal was accordingly  determined  on
   the  papers  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  was   dismissed   in   a
   determination promulgated on 28 March 2013.

5. In his determination, First-tier Judge Bartlett  noted  the  respondent's
   comments, in response to the grounds of appeal, that  the  appellant  had
   still not submitted any information  about  his  daughter,  such  as  her
   whereabouts,  her  immigration  status  or  a  letter  from  her   mother
   confirming she was expecting a visit. Judge Bartlett  accepted  that  the
   appellant's fianc�e was able to accommodate and support him but  was  not
   satisfied that the appellant had demonstrated that he intended  to  leave
   the United Kingdom at the end of his proposed visit. The judge  made  the
   point that, had the appellant requested an oral hearing, it may have been
   that his concerns could have been resolved by further  evidence,  but  in
   the absence of any further evidence  he  found  that  the  appellant  had
   failed to meet the burden of proof. He accordingly dismissed  the  appeal
   under the immigration rules.

6. Permission to appeal was sought on behalf of the appellant by his  United
   Kingdom representatives, on the basis that they had, in  fact,  requested
   an oral hearing in order  that  witnesses  could  attend,  and  that  the
   decision was therefore wrong  in  law.  The  application  for  permission
   enclosed a copy of a letter from Stewart & Co to the First-tier Tribunal,
   dated 12  February  2013,  advising  the  Tribunal  that  they  had  been
   instructed in the matter, providing the sponsor's details and  requesting
   an oral hearing of the appeal.

7. Permission was granted on 16  April  2013  on  the  grounds  of  arguable
   procedural unfairness with regard to the determination of the appeal.

Appeal Hearing

8. The appeal came before me on 6 June 2013.  I  advised  Mr  Bramble  that,
   whilst there was no copy of the letter of 12 February 2013 on  the  court
   correspondence file, the fact that the determination  had  been  sent  to
   Stewart & Co Solicitors suggested that their letter had been received  by
   the Tribunal in response to the Form IA35 issued to the appellant  on  17
   January 2013 inviting further submissions. I was therefore satisfied that
   the letter had been received but not acted upon, leading to  the  request
   for an oral hearing being overlooked, which had  resulted  in  procedural
   unfairness.

9. Mr Bramble accepted that the judge's decision ought therefore to  be  set
   aside and I accordingly set it aside. On the  basis  of  the  appellant's
   specific request that the appeal be re-made in the Upper Tribunal  rather
   than remitted to the First-tier Tribunal, and upon Mr Bramble's agreement
   with that course, I proceeded to hear  evidence  from  the  sponsor,  the
   appellant's fianc�e, for the purpose of re-making the decision.

10. The sponsor, Ms Ekwo, said that she became engaged to the  appellant  on
   15 February 2011 and they intended to get  married  this  Christmas.  His
   daughter was six years old. She had not met her but had spoken to her  by
   telephone  when  the  appellant  had  spoken  to  her.  He  had  a  close
   relationship with his daughter and she missed him a lot. Her mother would
   not allow her to go to visit her father in Spain because of her  age  but
   her father had told her that he would visit her when he got  a  visa  for
   the United Kingdom. The appellant divorced his wife, the  mother  of  his
   daughter, last year. When put to her that the appellant appeared to  have
   stated in his grounds of appeal before the First-tier Tribunal  that  his
   ex-wife was not the mother of his daughter, Ms Ekwo agreed  that  it  was
   not clear.  She suggested that what he had meant to say was that  it  was
   she who had invited him to the United Kingdom and not  his  ex-wife.  She
   last saw the appellant yesterday in the Netherlands.  His  brother  lived
   there and so she would go to see him whenever he  was  there  as  it  was
   closer than Spain. He paid regular maintenance to his daughter.  He  paid
   around �300 a month which he sent to her and she would  then  go  to  the
   bank and put the money into his ex-wife's account. She produced a  bundle
   of Nat West receipts as evidence. She would give  the  bank  the  account
   number and sort number of his ex-wife's  account,  with  the  appellant's
   name as the reference.

11. When cross-examined by Mr Bramble, the sponsor said that  the  appellant
   would send the money to her, sometimes by Western Union, but she did  not
   have any evidence of that. When asked why the appellant had not given her
   a letter from his ex-wife to produce to the Tribunal as  confirmation  of
   his visit to their daughter, Ms  Ekwo  said  that  it  was  she  who  was
   inviting him to the United Kingdom and  not  his  daughter,  although  he
   intended to visit his daughter. He intended to call his ex-wife  once  he
   got his visa and arrange the visit. Ms Ekwo said that she was aware  that
   the appellant had worked for Suiqas SL but she did not know where he  had
   worked prior to that. When asked if his contract  with  the  company  had
   been extended after January 2013 she said that she knew only that he  had
   had some temporary and permanent contracts and had been working in  Spain
   for many years. He was working for a different company now. The  deposits
   in his Santander account in Spain were from his account  in  Nigeria.  He
   had money in an account in Nigeria which he  had  inherited  and  he  had
   referred to that in his visa application form. Ms Ekwo confirmed that the
   appellant would be staying with her in the United Kingdom.

12.  The sponsor gave further details about the appellant's payments to  his
   ex-wife, when re-examined, and said that he had been  making  them  every
   month since about 2011. She was sure that his ex-wife and  daughter  were
   still in the United Kingdom.

13. In response to my further enquiry, Ms Ekwo said that the appellant's ex-
   wife was aware that he was intending to visit. She did not  know  why  he
   did not send the money directly to his ex-wife instead of through her but
   she believed that it was to do  with  international  charges  and  having
   receipts. She was aware that he had visited the United Kingdom previously
   but did not know the length of his visits. She was not sure  why  he  had
   been refused entry clearance previously. He suspected that it was because
   his ex-wife had invited him but had had no job at the time. He had  lived
   in Spain for twelve years and loved it there and wanted to visit for just
   a few days. He had not applied for Spanish citizenship as he had the same
   rights as a Spanish citizen. I asked if she knew why he  had  a  national
   insurance number for the United Kingdom and she replied that he had  told
   her that it was because his ex-wife had told him he  needed  it  to  show
   that he was married and could support her, but he had never worked here.

14. Mr Bramble, in his submissions, said that the focus in this  appeal  was
   upon the appellant's daughter, as his relationship with Ms Ekwo  did  not
   fall within the  amended  family  visitor  categories.  There  was  still
   insufficient evidence about his daughter. Mr Bramble admitted that it was
   difficult for him to pursue the  ECO's  concerns  about  the  appellant's
   employment as there was no document verification report. The evidence  of
   his tax payments indicated that he was employed at the relevant time  but
   did not explain how he had the funds from employment to make the deposits
   into his Santander account, albeit that there was evidence  of  funds  in
   his Nigerian account. In the  absence  of  adequate  evidence  about  his
   daughter, the appellant was unable to meet the requirements of the  rules
   and the appeal had to be dismissed.

15. Ms Simpson  submitted  that  there  was  sufficient  evidence  that  the
   appellant had a daughter in the United Kingdom, that he had a court order
   granting him contact with her and that his daughter was unable  to  visit
   him in Spain. The sponsor had given evidence of money transferred for her
   support. There was nothing in the immigration rules requiring there to be
   written confirmation of consent by a parent for the other parent  to  see
   their child. The  appeal  ought  therefore  to  succeed  on  that  basis.
   Alternatively, the appellant's relationship with his fianc�e was one that
   fell  within  the  family  visitor  regulations,  as  they  had  a  civil
   partnership. The appellant had no intention of remaining  in  the  United
   Kingdom. He was entitled to Spanish residence and intended to  return  to
   Nigeria to set up a business there. He was employed at the  time  of  the
   decision to refuse entry clearance. The deposits in his account had  been
   explained.

Consideration and findings

16. The Immigration Appeals (Family  Visitor)  Regulations  2012  came  into
   force on 9 July 2012 and are thus applicable  in  the  appellant's  case.
   Paragraph 2(2) sets out the  family  relationships  relevant  to  section
   88A(1)(a) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, as  giving
   rise to a right of appeal against  the  refusal  of  entry  clearance.  A
   fianc�e is not included in the list of relationships.

17. Ms Simpson submitted that civil partners were  included,  and  that  the
   sponsor could be regarded as a civil partner  given  the  length  of  her
   relationship with the appellant. However, it is clear that  that  is  not
   the case and that Ms Simpson  was  in  fact  thinking  of  a  common  law
   partnership, which did not fall  within  the  list  of  relationships.  A
   "civil partner" is defined in the interpretation section at  paragraph  6
   of the Immigration Rules, as "a civil partnership which exists  under  or
   by virtue of the Civil Partnership Act 2004 (and any reference to a civil
   partner is to be read accordingly)". There is no civil partnership in the
   terms indicated between the appellant  and  the  sponsor.  As  such,  the
   appellant is unable to appeal against the refusal of entry  clearance  on
   the basis of his intended visit to the sponsor and the appeal arises only
   with respect to his intended visit to his daughter.

18. The question then arises as to the validity of the  appeal  with  regard
   to the appellant's application to visit his daughter, in particular given
   the concerns about the lack of evidence in that regard. That was a matter
   considered by the Upper Tribunal in Ajakaiye (visitor appeals - right  of
   appeal) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 375, where it  was  stated  at  paragraph  12
   that:


   "The right of appeal under section 88A turns on whether "the  application
   was made" for the purpose of visiting a person  who  is  related  to  the
   applicant in one of the  ways  described  at  paragraph  2  of  the  2003
   Regulations. The reference to "the application was  made"  suggests  that
   the answer to whether a refusal of the application gives rise to a  right
   of appeal is governed by the purpose of the application. The most obvious
   place to find out  what  the  purpose  of  the  application  was  is  the
   applicant's completed application form and such other  documents  as  may
   have been submitted at the time in order to decide whether the  applicant
   had applied in order to visit such a relative.  If  examination  of  this
   material reveals that this was the stated purpose of the visit  then  the
   individual has a right of appeal and that right of appeal  is  not  lost,
   whatever evidence is  subsequently  served  and  even  if  that  evidence
   detracts from  and  undermines  the  application  itself.  If  subsequent
   evidence  reveals  that  an  individual's  intention  as  stated  in  the
   application itself is unreliable, or it is found to be  unreliable,  that
   may (depending on the circumstances and the other evidence in  the  case)
   justify reaching adverse conclusions on the requirements under  paragraph
   41 of the Immigration Rules but it would not justify  a  conclusion  that
   the individual did not have a right of appeal.  Equally if  there  is  an
   error of law in an assessment of what the purpose of the application made
   was, the  Upper  Tribunal  will  have  jurisdiction  to  investigate  the
   matter."


19. In the light of such findings, and in the absence of any submissions  to
   the contrary, it seems to me that there is a valid appeal.  Any  concerns
   as to the relationship and the nature of the appellant's  visit  in  that
   regard are relevant to his intentions and thus his ability  to  meet  the
   requirements of paragraph 41 of the immigration rules,  rather  than  the
   validity of the appeal.

20. As Mr Bramble acknowledged, the appellant has provided evidence  of  his
   employment with Suiqas SL together with his registration for  payment  of
   taxes in Spain and, in  the  absence  of  any  evidence  to  support  the
   allegations made by the  ECO,  the  respondent's  concerns  carry  little
   weight. On that basis, and in the light of evidence of funds available in
   his Nigerian bank  account,  it  seems  to  me  that  he  has  adequately
   addressed the concerns as to  his  financial  circumstances.  When  taken
   together with Ms  Ekwo's  oral  evidence  and  the  documentary  evidence
   relating to her property and income from employment, I am satisfied  that
   he has met the burden of demonstrating an ability to meet  the  costs  of
   his trip and that he would be adequately accommodated and  maintained  in
   the United Kingdom for the short period of his proposed visit.

21. However, the main concern in this appeal is the  appellant's  intentions
   arising from the lack of adequate evidence about his daughter. Whilst  he
   has stated that, aside from visiting his  fianc�e,  the  purpose  of  his
   visit was to see his daughter, he has still failed to show that that  was
   genuinely his intention. Despite  his  application  having  been  refused
   partly on the basis of an absence of evidence of  his  daughter  and  his
   intention and ability to  visit  her,  there  is  still  no  satisfactory
   evidence in that regard. I did not consider that Ms Ekwo's evidence alone
   was sufficient to address such concerns. She had never met  his  daughter
   and was only relying on  what  the  appellant  had  told  her  about  his
   daughter's presence in the United Kingdom and his intentions  as  regards
   visiting her. Although she produced receipts for payments made by herself
   to his ex-wife, she was unable to provide any confirmation that the money
   came from the appellant and was being used for the support of his  child.
   Her evidence about the payments was particularly vague,  perhaps  because
   of her own lack of knowledge about them, and she was  unable  to  provide
   any reasonable or credible explanation as to  why  the  appellant  should
   send the funds to her for onward transfer to  his  ex-wife,  rather  than
   simply sending the money directly to his ex-wife.

22. Ms Ekwo was, furthermore, unable to provide any explanation  as  to  why
   the appellant had not produced a letter from his  ex-wife  consenting  to
   him visiting his daughter, other than to say that it was she and not  his
   ex-wife who was inviting him to the United  Kingdom  and  sponsoring  the
   visit. However it seems to me that this total lack  of  any  evidence  of
   communication from his ex-wife and his daughter, albeit that she is  only
   six years of age, is a matter of some significance and concern.  That  is
   particularly  so,  given  the  presence  of  various  discrepancies   and
   anomalies in the evidence. One such anomaly, which I pointed  out  to  Ms
   Simpson, was that the second  ground  of  appeal  before  the  First-tier
   Tribunal appeared to suggest that the  appellant  was  stating  that  his
   daughter was not the child of his ex-wife.  Whilst  it  may  be,  as  the
   sponsor suggested, that that was simply a matter of bad grammar and  that
   the appellant was referring to the person who  had  sent  the  letter  of
   invitation, that was not the only discrepancy. I note that the appellant,
   at question 128 of his visa application form, dated 23 July 2012,  stated
   that he had not seen his daughter for the past  two  years,  yet  in  his
   statement he said at paragraph 8 that he last saw her on 26 May 2011 when
   she visited him with her mother. Ms Ekwo made no mention of such a  visit
   and her evidence suggested that the only way the appellant could see  his
   daughter was if he visited her since she was too young for her mother  to
   send her to Spain to see him.

23. Ms Simpson relied on the appellant's  ex-wife's  tenancy  agreement  and
   the court order as evidence of his  daughter's  presence  in  the  United
   Kingdom. However, whilst the address  given  by  the  appellant  for  his
   daughter in his visa application form is the same as that in the  tenancy
   agreement submitted in the appeal  bundle,  that  tenancy  agreement  was
   entered into in September 2009. There is no evidence  to  show  that  the
   appellant's ex-wife remained living at that address at the  time  of  the
   entry clearance application, nor that his daughter lived  there  at  that
   time. The court order is from a Nigerian court and, whilst it  refers  to
   his daughter as  living  in  the  United  Kingdom,  there  is  no  proper
   explanation why an order was sought in Nigeria rather than in the  United
   Kingdom, if she was living here. It also seems to me of  some  relevance,
   albeit perhaps somewhat peripheral, that  the  appellant  has  failed  to
   explain why he has not applied for Spanish  citizenship  as  a  means  of
   enabling him to visit the United Kingdom, and thus visiting his daughter,
   particularly following several previous unsuccessful attempts  to  obtain
   entry clearance to the United Kingdom as a Nigerian citizen.

24. In the circumstances, given the lack of  any  satisfactory  evidence  of
   the  appellant's  relationship  with  his  daughter  and  her   continued
   residence in the United Kingdom, I am unable  to  conclude  that  he  has
   genuinely demonstrated that the intended purpose of his trip, other  than
   to see his fianc�e, was to visit his child. This in turn casts doubts  on
   his overall intentions in regard to his proposed  trip.  Accordingly,  on
   the evidence before me, I cannot accept, on a balance  of  probabilities,
   that he is a genuine family visitor who intended only a  short  visit  to
   the United Kingdom before returning to Spain. I find that he  has  failed
   to show an ability to meet the requirements of the  relevant  immigration
   rule, namely paragraph 41 of HC 395. That does not,  of  course,  prevent
   him from making a fresh application to visit his daughter in the  future,
   but supported by full and satisfactory evidence.

25. Article 8 of the ECHR has not been raised and there clearly would be  no
   merit in a claim on such a basis. The  appellant  has,  for  the  reasons
   given above, failed to show that he has a family life with his  daughter.
   Even if his relationship with Ms Ekwa could be considered as family life,
   their relationship has been maintained on the  basis  of  visits  by  her
   travelling to meet with him and the refusal of entry clearance  does  not
   prevent that from continuing.  There  has  been  no  application  by  the
   appellant for him to remain in the United Kingdom with  Ms  Ekwo  on  any
   more permanent basis and indeed she  confirmed  that  that  was  not  his
   current intention. As such, Article 8 is not even engaged.

DECISION

26. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved an  error
   on a point of law. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is  therefore
   set aside. I re-make  the  decision  by  dismissing  the  appeal  on  all
   grounds.
