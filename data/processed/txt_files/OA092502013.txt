                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision  of  Judge  Shimmin
    made following a hearing at Bradford on 4th December, 2013.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, born  on  10th  February  1990.
    She applied to come to the UK as the  wife  of  Vaqas  Younis  but  was
    refused entry clearance on 19th March 2013. The Entry Clearance Officer
    was not satisfied that she was in a genuine and subsisting relationship
    with her husband  nor  that  she  had  provided  an  employer's  letter
    confirming her Sponsor's gross annual salary. In view of the fact  that
    she had not provided the specified evidence for the specified period as
    stated in Appendix FM/SE of the Immigration Rules he was not  satisfied
    that she had met their financial requirements.

 3. The Judge was satisfied that the couple were in a genuine relationship.
    He also accepted that the Sponsor was in work in the UK  and  that  the
    documentation supported  his  promotion  within  his  employment.   His
    income for the six months before the date of  application  (16  January
    2013) when annualised exceeded  the  required  figure  of  �18,600.  He
    dismissed the appeal because the Appellant  did  not  meet  the  strict
    requirement of Appendix FM/SE, namely that she produce  a  letter  from
    the  employer  who  issued  the  wage  slips  confirming  the  person's
    employment and gross annual salary. The employer's letter did not state
    the gross annual salary.  It stated the weekly gross wage.   The  gross
    annual salary was cited in a further document submitted with the Notice
    of Appeal.

 4. He considered paragraph 245AA  of  the  Rules  which  states  that  the
    application might  be  granted  exceptionally  provided  the  UKBA  was
    satisfied that the specified documents were genuine and  the  applicant
    meets all of the other requirements  of  the  Rules,  including,  inter
    alia, for example, where a specified document is in the wrong format.

 5. The Judge wrote as follows:

             "I have considered whether the absence  of  content  from  the
             document is the same as the document being in the wrong format
             and that the omission of the gross salary is format.

             In the concise Oxford dictionary those words  are  defined  as
             follows:

             Content - the things that are contained in something;

             Format - the way in which something is arranged or presented."

         I find there is a clear difference between the meanings.

         Accordingly, I find that the Respondent was not  under  a  duty  to
         apply evidential flexibility as set out in paragraph 245AA and  the
         Appellant has failed to meet the requirements of Appendix FM-SE.

         Accordingly I find the Appellant fails to meet the requirements  of
         the Immigration Rules."

 6. The Judge then considered whether the appeal ought to be allowed  under
    Article 8 of the ECHR.  He said:

         "The Immigration Rules set out how facts must be established but if
         a Tribunal is fully satisfied that the  facts  are  established  by
         other evidence it  appears  to  me  that  the  public  interest  is
         diminished.

         However, it is  the  prerogative  of  the  government  to  fix  the
         financial  and  documentary  requirements  for  certain  types   of
         immigration permissions.  Those requirements are  set  out  in  the
         Immigration Rules and I find that it is only in a  rare  case  that
         they should be departed from by the application of  the  protection
         offered by Article 8.

         In the Appellant's case I have found that she has  failed  to  meet
         the strict evidential requirement to establish  that  she  has  the
         required funds available to her.  I find  that  this  is  something
         that cannot normally be repaired by Article 8.

         The Appellant could argue that she meets the financial requirements
         of the Rules but  that  the  stringent  requirements  for  specific
         documents is not proportionate when balanced against the rights  of
         the Appellant to a private life.  It is  also  submitted  that  the
         decision is unreasonable when only the content of a single document
         is awry and the mischief of the Rule, that there be no recourse  to
         public funds, is met.

         I have sympathy for the Appellant  in  attempting  to  satisfy  the
         strict and prescriptive requirements of  Appendix  FM/SD.   However
         Article 8 is not a means of allowing an appeal that does not  quite
         meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  It is open to  the
         Appellant to make a fresh application under the  Immigration  Rules
         supplying all the required documentation.

         After considering all the circumstances of the Appellant's case and
         balancing the competing factors I find the  favours  which  are  in
         favour of the Appellant  do  not  outweigh  the  legitimate  public
         interest."

The Grounds of Application

 7. The Appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had erred in his approach to  paragraph  245AA  and  his  view  of  the
    evidential flexibility.  The Appellant relied on the case of  Rodriguez
    (flexibility policy) [2013] UKUT 00042.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by  Designated  Judge  Lewis  for  the
    reasons stated in the grounds on 21st January 2014.  Judge Lewis stated
    that although not raised in the  permission  application  he  harboured
    doubts about the Article 8 assessment which was arguably insufficiently
    reasoned.

 9. On 5th February 2014 the Respondent served a reply opposing the appeal.



Submissions

10. Mr Hussain relied on his grounds and submitted that  the  evidence  was
    plainly before the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to  establish  that  the
    substantive requirements of the Rules could be met.  The Appellant  met
    the requirements of paragraph 245AA and the Judge  was  wrong  to  find
    otherwise.  The appeal ought to have been allowed under the  Rules  and
    on common law principles of fairness.  In his consideration of  Article
    8 the Judge had taken too narrow a view of the  enquiry  which  he  was
    required to undertake and had failed to take into account all  relevant
    factors.  The reality of the situation was that the Sponsor was clearly
    earning the required sum of �18,600 and there was no policy  imperative
    underlying the refusal.

11. Mr Diwnycz submitted that the Judge was entitled to interpret paragraph
    245AA as he did, particularly since on the face  of  the  documentation
    there was an error.  The letter from the Sponsor's employer contained a
    mistake on its face.  The second  letter  said  that  the  Sponsor  was
    working for 40 hours per week at �8 per hour and he had a gross  weekly
    wage of �360 but in fact, at 40 hours a week, his wage would have  been
    �320.

Findings and Conclusions

12. Paragraph 245AA states as follows:

         "Documents not submitted with applications:

         (a)  Where part 6A or any appendices referred to in part  6A  state
             that specified documents must be provided the UK Border Agency
             will only consider documents that have been submitted with the
             application, and will only consider documents submitted  after
             the application where they are submitted  in  accordance  with
             sub-paragraph (b).

         (b)  If the applicant has submitted:

             (i)  a sequence of documents and some of the documents in  the
                  sequence have  been  omitted  (for  example  if  one  bank
                  statement from a series is missing);

             (ii) a document in the wrong format; or

             (iii)    a document  that  is  a  copy  and  not  an  original
                  document,

             the  UK  Border  Agency  may  contact  the  applicant  or  his
             representative in writing and request the  correct  documents.
             The requested documents must be  received  by  the  UK  Border
             Agency at the address specified in the  request  within  seven
             working days of the date of request.

         (c)  The UK Border  Agency  will  not  request  documents  where  a
             specified document has not  been  submitted  (for  example  an
             English language certificate is  missing),  or  where  the  UK
             Border Agency does not anticipate addressing the  omission  or
             are referred to in sub-paragraph (b)  will  lead  to  a  grant
             because the application will be refused for other reasons.

         (d)  If the applicant has submitted a specified document:

             (i)  in the wrong format, or

             (ii) that is a copy and not an original document,

             The application may be granted exceptionally, providing the UK
             Border Agency are satisfied that the specified  documents  are
             genuine and the applicant meet  all  the  other  requirements.
             The UK  Border  Agency  reserves  the  right  to  request  the
             specified documents in the correct format in all  cases  where
             (b) applies and to refuse applications if these documents  are
             not provided as set out in (b).

13. So far as the Rules are concerned, there is a particular  problem  with
    the evidence from the employer. The letter dated 29th March 2013 is not
    consistent with the evidence in the  payslips.   In  the  payslips  the
    Sponsor is recorded as working for 45 hours  per  week  and  a  payment
    being made of �360 which is indeed reflected in the bank accounts.  Had
    there not been an error within the employer's  letter,  it  would  have
    been more strongly  arguable  that  the  evidence  submitted  with  the
    application, which gave a gross weekly wage rather than an annual wage,
    could properly have been regarded to be in the wrong format.  Paragraph
    245AA may have come into play and an opportunity  ought  to  have  been
    given by the UKBA for the correct document  to be  produced.   However,
    since the letter contains a clear mistake on its face, there is no such
    duty and no error in the judge so finding.

14. Secondly, it is difficult to see how the judge erred in his  assessment
    of Article 8.  He addressed himself to the question as to  whether  the
    decision was in pursuit of a legitimate aim, in particular the economic
    wellbeing of the country and said that he was satisfied that the  facts
    were established by other evidence, and  the  public  interest  in  the
    refusal was therefore diminished.  There is no  error  in  his  stating
    that since the Appellant had  failed  to  meet  the  strict  evidential
    requirements of the Rules it would only  be  in  rare  cases  that  the
    requirement as set out in the Rules should be circumvented by  allowing
    the appeal on human rights grounds, citing Patel & Others v SSHD [2013]
    UKSC 72 and in particular the observation  that  Article  8  is  not  a
    general dispensing power to be  distinguished  from  the  Secretary  of
    State's discretion to allow leave to  remain  outside  the  Rules.  The
    judge clearly had sympathy with the Appellant, but it was a matter  for
    him to  decide  whether  the  refusal  was  disproportionate  and  that
    decision will not be interfered with by an Appellate Tribunal absent an
    error of law.

Decision

15. The original judge did not err in law.  The appeal is dismissed.
