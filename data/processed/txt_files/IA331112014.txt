For the Appellant:     Mr S Karim, instructed by Haque & Hausman Solicitors
(London)
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 1 December 1989 and on
    13 June 2014 he applied, one day before the expiry of his student leave
    which was curtailed on 17 June 2014, for leave to remain as the  spouse
    of Fahima Begum, a UK citizen.  The appellant and the sponsor Ms  Begum
    were married in the UK at Newham Registry Office on 30  November  2013.
    It should be noted that the appellant's leave was curtailed with notice
    on 22 March 2014 to expire on 17 June 2014 and this  decision  was  not
    appealed.

 2. The Secretary of State refused the application on 5 August 2014 on  the
    basis that the appellant had not fulfilled the  financial  requirements
    set out at paragraph E-LTRP.3.1:

         "E-LTRP.3.1. The applicant must provide  specified  evidence,  from
         the sources listed in paragraph E-LTRP.3.2., of -

         (a)  a specified gross annual income of at least -

             (i)  �18,600; (ii) an additional �3,800 for the  first  child;
                  and (iii) an additional �2,400 for each additional  child;
                  alone or in combination with

         (b)  specified savings of -

             (i)   �16,000;  and  (ii)  additional  savings  of  an  amount
                  equivalent to 2.5 times the amount which is the difference
                  between the gross annual income from the sources listed in
                  paragraph E-LTRP.3.2.(a)-(f) and the total amount required
                  under paragraph E- LTRP.3.1.(a); or (c)  the  requirements
                  in paragraph E-LTRP.3.3.being met, unless paragraph  EX.1.
                  applies.

         In this paragraph "child" means a dependent child of the  applicant
         who is -

             (a)  under the age of 18 years, or who was under the age of 18
                  years when they were first granted entry under this route;



             (b)  applying for entry  clearance  or  is  in  the  UK  as  a
                  dependant of the applicant;

             (c)  not a British Citizen or settled in the UK; and

             (d)  not an EEA national with a right  to  remain  in  the  UK
                  under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

        E-LTRP.3.2. When determining whether the financial  requirement  in
        paragraph ELTRP.

        3.1. is met only the following sources may be taken into account t-



             (a)  income of the partner from specified employment or  self-
                  employment;

             (b)  income of the applicant from specified employment or self-
                  employment unless they are working illegally;

             (c)  specified pension income of the applicant and partner;

             (d)  any specified maternity allowance or bereavement  benefit
                  received by the applicant and partner in  the  UK  or  any
                  specified  payment  relating  to  service  in  HM   Forces
                  received by the applicant or partner;

             (e)  other specified income of the applicant and partner;

             (f)  income from the sources at (b), (d) or (e) of a dependent
                  child of the applicant under paragraph E-LTRP.3.1. who  is
                  aged 18 years or over; and

             (g)   specified  savings  of  the  applicant,  partner  and  a
                  dependent  child  of  the  applicant  under  paragraph  E-
                  LTRP.3.1. who is aged 18 years or over.

        E-LTRP.3.3. The requirements to meet this paragraph are -

             (a)  the applicant's partner must be receiving one or more  of
                  the following -

                  (i)   disability living allowance;

                  (ii)  severe disablement allowance;

                  (iii)     industrial injury disablement benefit;

                  (iv)     attendance allowance;

                  (v)  carer's allowance;

                  (vi)  personal independence payment;

                  (vii)    Armed Forces Independence Payment  or  Guaranteed
                      Income Payment under the  Armed  Forces  Compensation
                      Scheme; or

                  (viii)     Constant   Attendance    Allowance,    Mobility
                      Supplement or War Disablement Pension under  the  War
                      Pensions Scheme; and

             (b)  the applicant must provide evidence that their partner is
                  able to maintain and accommodate themselves, the applicant
                  and any dependants adequately in the UK  without  recourse
                  to public funds."

 3. It was set out that the appellant did not  meet  the  income  threshold
    requirement of �18,600 under Appendix  FM  and  he  did  not  meet  the
    related evidential requirements set out  in  Appendix  FM-SE.   He  had
    demonstrated he had an annual income of �7,089.98 in the twelve  months
    prior to the date of the application and claimed that his spouse had an
    annual income  of  �10,293.74.   However  his  wife  had  not  been  in
    employment for six months prior to the date of the application and  nor
    had she an annual income of �18,600 in the twelve months prior  to  the
    date of the application.  Therefore the spouse's earnings could not  be
    counted towards the �18,600 threshold.

 4. The Secretary of State considered the application of exception EX.1  in
    conjunction with EX.2:

         "EX.1. This paragraph applies if -

         (a)

             (i)  the applicant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                  relationship with a child who -

                  (aa) is under the age of 18 years, or was under the age of
                      18 years when the applicant was first  granted  leave
                      on the basis that this paragraph applied;

                  (bb) is in the UK;

                  (cc)  is  a  British  Citizen  or  has  lived  in  the  UK
                      continuously for at least  the  7  years  immediately
                      preceding the date of application ;and

             (ii) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave
                  the UK; or

         (b)  the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a
             partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled  in
             the UK or  in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or  humanitarian
             protection, and there are insurmountable obstacles  to  family
             life with that partner continuing outside the UK.

         EX.2.  For  the  purposes  of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  "insurmountable
         obstacles" means the very significant difficulties which  would  be
         faced by the applicant or their partner in continuing their  family
         life together outside the UK and which could  not  be  overcome  or
         would entail very serious  hardship  for  the  applicant  or  their
         partner."

 5. For the  purposes  of  EX.1(b)  insurmountable  obstacles  means  'very
    significant difficulties'.

 6. The Secretary of State did not  consider  there  were  any  exceptional
    circumstances, which, consistent with the right to respect  for  family
    life contained in Article 8 of the European Convention, might warrant a
    grant of leave outside the Immigration Rules.

 7. The Secretary of State also considered paragraph 276ADE.

 8. First Tier Tribunal Judge Taylor dismissed the appellant's appeal.  The
    sole basis to refuse the application was that the parties had failed to
    show they earned �18,600.

 9. The judge examined the payslips.  The judge accepted that payslips were
    submitted for six months in relation to the appellant for the month  of
    January to June 2014  and  calculated  his  earnings  as  evidenced  as
    �7,089.  The judge set out the following in relation to  the  sponsor's
    income:

         "12. The respondent did not accept the sponsor's income as she  had
             not been in employment  for  six  months.   However  paragraph
             13(b) of Appendix FM-SE provides that where a person does  not
             have six months of employment at the date of application,  the
             gross annual salary will be calculated as at the date  of  the
             application.  The sponsor submitted five months  of  payslips,
             as she stated that the first payslip covered two months.   The
             total of the five  months  earnings  was  �4,289,  which  when
             annualised provides a salary of �10,293 which is the salary as
             claimed by the sponsor.  The total of �10,293  and  �7,089  is
             �17,392, which is  insufficient  to  demonstrate  earnings  of
             �18,600.   I  am  satisfied  that  as  at  the  date  of   the
             application, insufficient evidence of earnings were  submitted
             to meet the financial requirements.

         13.  As this is an in-country appeal, it was submitted on behalf of
             the appellant that  the  Tribunal  could  take  post  decision
             evidence into account, up to the date  of  the  hearing.   The
             appellant and sponsor submitted bank statements  and  payslips
             from January 2014 until November 2014,  which  indicated  that
             their  joint  income  was  in  excess  of  �18,600.   However,
             Appendix FM-SE provides at paragraph D that a  decision  maker
             may only consider documents  submitted  at  the  time  of  the
             application.  There is limited provision for consideration  of
             post application documents, as set out in the Appendix and  it
             was not submitted that any of the exceptions applied.  I  find
             that the post graduate diploma in business management decision
             evidence of earnings  submitted  at  the  appeal  may  not  be
             considered as part of the appeal and only documents  submitted
             with the application may be taken into account.  On the  basis
             of documents submitted with  the  application,  the  appellant
             does not meet the requirements of the Rules."

10. Application for permission to appeal  was  made  by  Mr  Karim  and  he
    expanded his written application in his submission.  He submitted  that
    under Section 85(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
    the judge could consider postdecision evidence and  in  error  confined
    himself to the evidence submitted with the application.  The appeal was
    an in-country  appeal  and  the  judge  was  obliged  to  consider  the
    circumstances at the date of the hearing under  Section  85(4)  of  the
    2002 Act and this section trumped any evidential  requirements  of  the
    Rules if there is such prohibition.  This was not a points-based appeal
    and therefore Section 85A of the  2002  Act  precluding  post  decision
    evidence would not have applied.

11. In his second ground Mr Karim argued that  the  judge  was  nonetheless
    obliged to consider under Article 8 the present circumstances including
    the fact that the requirements of the Rules were met.  This was another
    error in the decision.

12. It was argued that in his reasoning the judge concluded there  were  no
    compelling circumstances (paragraph 14 of the determination) and  there
    were material errors of law in this approach following MM  &  Others  v
    SSHD [2012]  EWCA  civ  985.   It  was  arguable  that  the  compelling
    circumstances were not applicable.

13. In any event the appellant met the income threshold as at the  date  of
    the appeal hearing was in itself a compelling reason for  consideration
    outside the Rules.  The test for  removal  or  relocation  outside  the
    Rules  under  the  Strasbourg  case  law  was  more  modest  than   the
    insurmountable  obstacles  test  under  EX.1.   The  judge   erred   in
    concluding that there were no insurmountable  obstacles  to  relocation
    for the following reasons.  The judge had not factored in the sponsor's
    employment, family ties and most importantly her status  as  a  British
    citizen as well as her private life and the judge had not set  out  how
    he applied the insurmountable obstacles test and  did  not  follow  the
    guidance in MF (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
    [2013] EWCA.  The judge also failed to consider  Section  117B  of  the
    2002 Act.  The appellant was not in the UK unlawfully.

14. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Landes
    who did not find favour with the argument in relation to Section  85(4)
    but found it was arguable that the judge should have taken into account
    the present circumstances when considering Article 8.

Conclusions

15. Paragraph 15 of Appendix FM-SE states  that  in  respect  of  paragraph
    13(b) and 13(d), the provisions in this paragraph also apply:

         "(a) In order to evidence the level of gross annual income required
             by Appendix FM, the  person  must  meet  the  requirements  in
             paragraph 13b  or 13d(1); and

         (b)  the person must also meet the level  of  gross  annual  income
             required by Appendix FM on the basis that their income is  the
             total of: (1) the gross income from salaried employment in the
             UK or overseas and by the person in the twelve months prior to
             the date of application."

16. In this instance the appellant was relying on paragraph  13(b)  because
    the sponsor had been employed by her current employer as at the date of
    application for less than six months.  In accordance with paragraph  15
    the appellant must show the gross income  prior  to  the  date  of  the
    application.  I did not accept Mr Karim's argument that the date of the
    application ran up to the date of the hearing (5th January 2015).   The
    date of the decision by the Secretary  of  State  was  5  August  2014.
    Secondly, the date of an application in connection with immigration  is
    set out at paragraph 34(g) of the Immigration  Rules  as  follows:  (1)
    where the application form is sent by post the date of posting and  the
    Secretary of State recorded that this application was made on  13  June
    2014. Even if the date of the application were extended to the date  of
    the decision it was not argued that further information  was  submitted
    between the date of the application and the  date  of  decision.  There
    were only four payslips submitted to June 2014.

17. It is clear from paragraph 12 of the decision that the  judge  assessed
    income as at  that  date  and  found  that  the  total  of  income  was
    insufficient.  I also note that  the  judge  in  error  annualised  the
    income of the sponsor.  This is not in accordance with Paragraph 15  of
    Appendix FM-SE.  This however was to the appellant's advantage.

18. The Rule is clear at paragraph 15 that income must be  shown  prior  to
    the date of the application, that is in this case prior to the date  of
    13th June 2014 and Section 85(4) of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 states that on an appeal under Section 82(1) against  a
    decision the Tribunal may consider any matter which it thinks  relevant
    to the substance of the decision including a matter arising  after  the
    date of the decision but this does not mean that  this  can  alter  the
    substance of the Rule as it is set out.  The question must  be  whether
    the appellant can meet the Immigration Rules.  The evidence was not  in
    existence even if it were considered at the date of  the  hearing  that
    the appellant could meet the Immigration  Rules  at  the  date  of  the
    application.

19. At [13] the judge stated that Appendix FM-SE provides  at  paragraph  D
    that a decision maker may only consider documents submitted at the time
    of the application and that there was only limited provision  for  post
    application documents as set  out  in  the  Appendix  and  it  was  not
    submitted that any of the exceptions applied.  Even if  the  judge  was
    incorrect to apply paragraph D as I have indicated above the  documents
    submitted subsequently did not assist the appellant in showing that she
    had fulfilled the  Rules  because  the  Rules  are  specific  that  the
    evidential  requirements  are  needed  prior  to  the   date   of   the
    application.

20. I therefore find that this challenge to the decision cannot succeed.

21. Secondly, Mr Karim submitted that there was a finding by the  judge  at
    [13] in the following terms:

         "the appellant and sponsor submitted bank statements  and  payslips
         from January 2014 until November 2014 which  indicated  that  their
         joint income was in excess of �18,600".

22. The question was then raised as to whether the judge having found  that
    the income threshold was met as at the date  of  the  hearing,  he  was
    right in considering that there were  no  compelling  circumstances  to
    consider the matter outside the rules.

23. The judge specifically recorded at [14] that it was submitted that  the
    parties had a  family  life  as  they  had  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship but they had failed to meet the specific requirements with
    regards to financial matters.  The judge went on to consider  paragraph
    EX.1 of Appendix FM in that a person may exceptionally remain in the UK
    if that person is in a genuine and subsisting relationship  with  a  UK
    citizen and there are insurmountable obstacles to family  life  with  a
    partner outside the UK.

24. Insurmountable obstacles are defined at EX.2 of Appendix FM and mean

         "the very significant difficulties which  would  be  faced  by  the
         applicant or their partner in continuing their family life together
         outside the UK and which could not be overcome or would entail very
         serious hardship for the applicant or their partner".

25. The judge gave reasons as to why the appellant could  not  fulfil  EX.1
    finding that both  parties  were  from  Bangladesh  and  there  was  no
    immigration reason why they may not resume married life outside the UK.
     The judge acknowledged and considered [14]  that  the  sponsor  was  a
    British citizen and had family in the UK but her spouse was her next-of-
    kin and although she may prefer to live near her family in the UK  that
    was not an insurmountable obstacle.

26. The question is whether the judge  should  have  gone  on  to  consider
    Article 8 outside the Rules and was in error in concluding  that  there
    were no compelling  circumstances  in  the  light  of  the  appellant's
    meeting the financial threshold.

27. The two-stage approach has been endorsed more recently by the Court  of
    Appeal in Singh and Khalid v Secretary of State for the Home Department
    [2015] EWCA Civ 74 (at para 64).  A proposition also  endorsed  by  the
    Court of Appeal in Singh and Khalid at [64]  is that




         "... there is no need to conduct a  full  separate  examination  of
         article 8 outside the  Rules  where,  in  the  circumstances  of  a
         particular  case,  all  the  issues  have  been  addressed  in  the
         consideration under the Rules."

28. The judge set out that the appellants could not  meet  the  Immigration
    rules and in his view all the issues had been considered.   That  is  a
    matter for the judge.

29. In SS (Congo & Others) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 Lord  Justice  Richards  had
    the following to say at [29]:

         "It is clear that it cannot be maintained as a general  proposition
         that LTR or LTE  outside  the  Immigration  Rules  should  only  be
         granted in exceptional circumstances.  However, in certain specific
         context a proper application of Article 8 may itself make it  clear
         that the legal test for grant of  LTR  or  LTE  outside  the  Rules
         should indeed  be  attested  exceptionality.   This  has  now  been
         identified  to  be  the  case,  on  the  basis  of   the   constant
         jurisprudence of the ECtHR itself, in relation to applications  for
         LTR outside the Rules  on  the  basis  of  family  life  (where  no
         children are involved) established in the United Kingdom at a  time
         when the presence of one or other of the partners was known  to  be
         precarious - see Nagre, paragraphs 38 to 43 approved by this  court
         in MF (Nigeria) at 41 and 42".

    And at [33]

         "In our judgment, even though a test  of  exceptionality  does  not
         apply in every case falling within the scope of Appendix FM, it  is
         accurate to say that the general  position  outside  the  sorts  of
         special contexts referred to above is that compelling circumstances
         would need to be identified to support a claim  for  grant  of  LTR
         outside the new Rules in Appendix  FM.  In  our  view,  that  is  a
         formulation which is not as strict as a test of exceptionality or a
         requirement of "very compelling reasons"  (as  referred  to  in  MF
         (Nigeria) in  the  context  of  the  Rules  applicable  to  foreign
         criminals), but which  gives  appropriate  weight  to  the  focused
         consideration of public interest factors as finds expression in the
         Secretary of State's formulation of the new Rules in  Appendix  FM.
         It also reflects the formulation in Nagre at para. [29], which  has
         been tested and has survived scrutiny in  this  court:  see,  e.g.,
         Haleemudeen at [44], per Beatson LJ".

30. The balancing  factors  here  are  on  the  one  hand  the  appellant's
    immigration status was precarious when he formed his  relationship  and
    made his application to the Home Office but on the other hand,  it  was
    argued, as at the date  of  the  hearing  which  is  relevant  for  the
    purposes of Article 8, there was a finding made by the judge  that  the
    couple had in fact fulfilled the financial  requirements.   Should  the
    appellant be required to return to Bangladesh he  would  be  unable  to
    return because he would not have the income? The point was made in this
    case that should the appellant be returned to his home country he would
    not be able to fulfil the requirements of the Immigration rules because
    the appellant and sponsor may not be  able  to  demonstrate  sufficient
    income and therefore the there  was  a  need  to  conduct  a  full  and
    separate examination of the Article 8 outside the rules.  At  the  date
    of the hearing the sponsor and appellant could show that they  met  the
    required sum.

31. The test to my mind is set out clearly in R (on the application of Chen
    v Secretary of State for the Home Department) Appendix FM  Chikwamba  -
    temporary separation proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189.

32. At [39]

         "If it is shown by an individual (the burden of  proof  being  upon
         him or her) that an application for  entry  clearance  from  abroad
         would  (my  emphasis)  be  granted  and  that  there  would  be   a
         significant interference with family life by temporary removal  the
         weight to be accorded to the form requirement  of  obtaining  entry
         clearance is reduced.  In cases involving children,  where  removal
         would interfere with the child's enjoyment of family life with  one
         or other of his parents while entry clearance is obtained, it  will
         be easier to show that the  balance  on  proportionality  falls  in
         favour of the claimant than in cases which do not involve  children
         but where removal interferes with family life between  parties  who
         knowingly entered into  the  relationship  in  the  knowledge  that
         family life was being established whilst the immigration status  of
         one party was precarious.  In other words, in the  former  case  it
         would be easier to show the individual  circumstances  fall  within
         the minority envisaged by the  House  of  Lords  in  Huang  or  the
         exceptions referred to in judgments of the ECHR and in  the  latter
         case.  However it all depends on the facts.

         [40] In Chikwamba, it was accepted that an  application  for  entry
         clearance would succeed and that went in the claimant's favour".

33. Mr Karim submitted that at the date of the hearing it would appear that
    the appellant had not fallen foul of the suitability  requirements,  he
    has not remained in the UK unlawfully albeit his leave was curtailed.

34. For the reasons given below, I do not, however, accept that  the  judge
    was finding without more that at the date of the hearing the  appellant
    could fulfil the financial requirements of the  Immigration  Rules.   I
    take into account it  was  found  that  there  were  no  insurmountable
    obstacles to the return of the appellant's  partner  and  sponsor.  The
    judge also factored in circumstances of this particular case  that  the
    appellant's sponsor has extensive family here.

35. This is not an entry clearance case as was the situation in SS Congo  v
    SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 317  but  nonetheless  SS  Congo   identifies  the
    approach taken to both LTE and LTR applications.  SS Congo acknowledges
    that for the general run of cases the rules reflected a fair balance of
    interests under Article 8 and the rules provided  significant  evidence
    of the relevant public interest which needed to be taken into account.

         'Accordingly, a court or tribunal is required to give the new Rules
         "greater weight than as merely a starting point for the
         consideration of the proportionality of an interference with
         Article 8 rights" ([47])'.

36. SS Congo v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 317 refers to the safeguarding role and
    need  for  consistency  within  the  rules  and  identifies  that   the
    Immigration Rules incorporate a difference between Leave to  Enter  and
    Leave to Remain applications through the use of EX.1 and EX.2, which in
    this  case  the  judge  addressed,  and  refers   to   the   compelling
    circumstances outside the rules which the judge did not find.   If  the
    rules are not met then a further application should be made.  The court
    sets out the approach as follows:

         'In the light of these authorities, we consider that the state  has
         a wider margin of appreciation in determining the conditions to  be
         satisfied before LTE is granted, by contrast with the  position  in
         relation to decisions  regarding  LTR  for  persons  with  a  (non-
         precarious) family life already established in the United  Kingdom.
         The Secretary of State has already, in effect,  made  some  use  of
         this wider margin of appreciation by excluding section  EX.1  as  a
         basis for grant of LTE, although it is available  as  a  basis  for
         grant of LTR. The LTE Rules therefore maintain, in general terms, a
         reasonable relationship with the requirements of Article 8  in  the
         ordinary run of cases. However,  it  remains  possible  to  imagine
         cases where the individual interests at stake are of a particularly
         pressing nature so that a good claim for  LTE  can  be  established
         outside the Rules. In our view, the appropriate general formulation
         for this category is that such cases will arise where an  applicant
         for LTE can show that compelling circumstances exist (which are not
         sufficiently recognised under the new Rules) to require  the  grant
         of such leave'[40]....

         'In our judgment, the approach to Article 8 in  the  light  of  the
         Rules in Appendix FM-SE should be the same as  in  respect  of  the
         substantive LTE and LTR Rules in Appendix FM. In other  words,  the
         same general position applies, that compelling circumstances  would
         have to apply to justify a grant of LTE or LTR where  the  evidence
         Rules are not complied with'[51]....

         'Secondly, enforcement of the evidence rules ensures that  everyone
         applying for LTE or LTR is treated equally and fairly  in  relation
         to the evidential  requirements  they  must  satisfy.  As  well  as
         keeping the  costs  of  administration  within  reasonable  bounds,
         application of standard rules is an important means  of  minimising
         the risk of arbitrary differences in  treatment  of  cases  arising
         across the wide range of  officials,  tribunals  and  courts  which
         administer the system of immigration controls. In this regard,  the
         evidence Rules (like the substantive Rules) serve as a safeguard in
         relation to rights of applicants and family members  under  Article
         14 to equal treatment within the scope of Article 8:' [53]...

         'The Secretary of State remains entitled to enforce  the  Rules  in
         the usual way, to say that the Rules have not  been  satisfied  and
         that the applicant should apply again when the  circumstances  have
         indeed changed. This reflects a fair balance between the  interests
         of the individual and the public interest. The Secretary  of  State
         is not required to take  a  speculative  risk  as  to  whether  the
         requirements in the Rules will in fact be satisfied in  the  future
         when deciding what to do. Generally, it is fair that the  applicant
         should  wait  until  the  circumstances  have   changed   and   the
         requirements in the Rules are satisfied and then apply, rather than
         attempting to jump the queue by asking for  preferential  treatment
         outside the Rules in advance'[57]

37. The judge stated that

         'the appellant and sponsor submitted bank statements  and  payslips
         from January 2014 until November 2014  which  indicted  that  their
         joint  income  was  in  excess  of  �18,600.   There  are  specific
         evidential requirements to be assessed and the judge throughout the
         determination made it  clear  that  he  was  concentrating  on  the
         documentation relevant at the date of application'.[13]

38. First, I am not persuaded that the judge specifically  found  that  the
    financial requirements were met for the  purposes  of  the  immigration
    rules at the date of the hearing. He merely stated that the  'appellant
    and sponsor submitted bank statements and payslips  from  January  2014
    until November 2014 which indicated that  their  joint  income  was  in
    excess of the requirements'.  Indeed at [14] the judge  confirmed  that
    'the respondent has  set  out  specific  requirements  with  regard  to
    financial matters and the parties have failed to meet  them'.  Secondly
    even if it were, this effectively argues that  the  appellants  do  not
    need to meet the Immigration Rules at the date of the  application  and
    can merely wait and ensure that the rules are met by the  date  of  the
    hearing.  That would, in effect, circumvent  the  requirements  of  the
    rules. Emphasis has been placed in the authorities in relation  to  the
    financial requirements of the need for predictability and  consistency.
     The approach taken by  SS  Congo  is  that  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules at Appendix FM are  lawful  and  unless  there  is  a
    pressing reason not taken into account that the Rules  reflect  a  fair
    balance in relation to Article 8.  If the  appellant  cannot  meet  the
    Rules then they need to make a further application. In substance,  even
    without applying the test  of  a  compelling  circumstance,  the  judge
    applied EX.1 and found all the relevant factors  had  been  taken  into
    account.

39. Further reference was made to the failure of the judge to cite  Section
    117B Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  and  find  that  the
    appellant is not a burden on the UK taxpayer and  would  appear  to  be
    able to speak English further to Section 117B(3).   Section  117B(4)(b)
    confirms that little weight should be given to  a  relationship  formed
    with a qualifying partner that is established by a  person  at  a  time
    when the person is in the United Kingdom unlawfully.  The appellant was
    not in the UK  unlawfully.   The  fact  that  the  appellant  was  here
    lawfully does not in this instance necessarily  positively  assist  the
    appellant AM (S 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC).

40. Sanade and others (British children - Zambrano -  Dereci)  [2012]  UKUT
    00048(IAC) refers to the Case C-34/09 Ruiz  Zambrano  which  'makes  it
    clear that where the child or indeed the remaining spouse is a  British
    citizen and therefore a citizen of the European Union, as a  matter  of
    EU law it is not possible to require the family as a unit  to  relocate
    outside of the European Union or for the Secretary of State  to  submit
    that it would be reasonable for them to do so'. However the  judge  was
    fully aware that the spouse was a British citizen and  fully  aware  of
    her employment and set out the facts relating  thereto.   There  is  no
    requirement that the spouse must leave the United Kingdom. The  parties
    were aware when they initiated the relationship that the leave  of  the
    first appellant was precarious.  It is open to the appellant to make  a
    further application for leave to return when circumstances change.

41. As SS Congo notes

         "The question of the right of the British citizen to live in the UK
         with non EEA partners who do not have the right of abode in the  UK
         was considered in MM Lebanon.  As per Abdulaziz Article  8  imposes
         no general obligation on a member state to  facilitate  the  choice
         made by a married couple to reside in it and Article 8  is  not  an
         absolute right'[138]"

42. The First-tier Tribunal made no error of law and his  decision  is  set
    aside.  We remake the decision and dismiss the appeal.

43. No anonymity direction is made.
