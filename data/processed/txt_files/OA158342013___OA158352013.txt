Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Walsh instructed by Stephen & Richard
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwnycz, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are mother and son who were born on 21 February 1973 and
    4 June 1995 respectively.  They are citizens of the  People's  Republic
    of China.  On 17 May 2013 they each applied for entry clearance to join
    the sponsor, Yujin Chen who is respectively their husband and father.

 2. On 28 June 2013, the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  refused  each  of  the
    applications.  In relation to the first  appellant,  the  ECO  was  not
    satisfied that she met the "partner" requirement in E-ECP  of  Appendix
    FM of the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).  First,  the  ECO  was
    not satisfied that the relationship between the first appellant  was  a
    genuine and subsisting one as required by E-ECP2.6.  Secondly, the  ECO
    was not satisfied that the appellant met the financial requirements  in
    E-ECP3.1 in that she could not demonstrate that  the  sponsor's  annual
    income was at least �22,400.  The second  appellant's  application  for
    entry clearance was refused in line with that of his mother.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 3. The appellant's appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a  determination
    dated 15 July 2014, Judge A W Khan dismissed the  appellants'  appeals.
    It was accepted before Judge Khan that the appellants could not succeed
    under the Immigration Rules as the sponsor's income was only �12,162.47
    and therefore fell  �10,237.53  short  of  the  required  amount  under
    Appendix  FM  of  �22,400.   However,  Judge  Khan  accepted  that  the
    relationship between the first appellant and sponsor was a genuine  and
    subsisting one and that they intended to live together permanently.  As
    a result, he went on to consider whether the appellants  could  succeed
    under Art 8 of the ECHR despite the fact that the sponsor did not  have
    the required income under the Rules.  In the  light  of  the  Court  of
    Appeal's decision in R (MM (Lebanon) and Others) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ
    985 Judge Khan concluded at para 26 that:

         "I am bound to dismiss the first  appellant's  appeal  because  she
         could not meet the minimum requirements of the Rules at the date of
         the decision and it follows that the second appellant's appeal also
         fails.  The Art 8 appeal must fail in the light  of  the  Court  of
         Appeal's decision."

    Consequently, he dismissed each appellant's appeal under Art 8.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 4. The appellants sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on the
    basis that the judge had  been  wrong  in  law  to  conclude  that  the
    appellants' appeals fell to be dismissed because of the Court of Appeal
    decision MM and Others.  The grounds argued that the Court of  Appeal's
    decision had been handed down after the date of  the  hearing  and  the
    appellants had not been given an opportunity, through their Counsel, to
    make any submissions that  the  Court  of  Appeal's  decision  did  not
    require the dismissal of their appeals under Art 8.

 5. On 21 August 2014 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Fisher)  granted  the
    appellants permission on that ground.

 6. Following the grant of permission, on 20 July 2015 the  Vice  President
    of UTIAC issued directions to the parties, in particular requiring  the
    appellants to  submit  within  fourteen  days  of  the  direction  "the
    submissions they would have made in relation to MM".

 7.  Under  cover  of  letter  of  29  July  2015,  the  appellants'  legal
    representatives submitted, in response to those directions, a  document
    drafted by the appellants' Counsel, Mr Walsh in  which  it  was  argued
    that the Court of Appeal's decision in MM and others did not preclude a
    consideration of whether an individual's Art  8  rights  were  breached
    despite a failure to meet the financial requirements under  the  Rules.
    At para 7, the argument is put as follows:

         "The Court of Appeal in MM recognise that individual decisions  may
         be amenable to an argument that they are disproportionate in  their
         circumstances notwithstanding that  the  failed  challenge  to  the
         lawfulness of the regime  itself  on  which  the  decisions  relied
         (para.161).  The appellant submits that the decisions under  appeal
         were disproportionate and the judge's assessment of  that  argument
         was flawed in that he considered that the holding by the  Court  of
         Appeal in MM that the scheme was lawful disposed to  the  argument.
         It did not do so."

 8. In para 6 of the response are set out a number of factors  which  would
    have  been  relied  upon  under  Art  8:   the   genuineness   of   the
    relationships; that the second appellant would no  longer  be  able  to
    present an application for entry clearance as a child as he would be an
    adult and that would "lead to the break up of a family unit"; and

         "the circumstances were such that despite the genuine (sic) of  the
         relationships having been established and the  financial  threshold
         is capable of being met, the passage to (sic)  time  precluded  the
         Second Appellant from qualifying for entry under the Rules as he is
         no longer a minor".

 9. Thus, the appeals came before me.

Discussion

     The Error of Law

10. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Diwnycz accepted that the judge  should
    have considered  Art  8  and  whether  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    decisions were disproportionate.  He accepted that the decision of  the
    Court of Appeal in MM and Others did not, contrary to what was said  by
    the judge in para 26 of his determination, require that the appellants'
    Art 8 appeals be dismissed simply because the first appellant could not
    meet the minimum income requirements under the Rules.  Mr  Diwnycz  did
    not seek to sustain the judge's decisions to dismiss the appeals  under
    Art 8 and both representatives invited me to remake the decisions under
    Art 8 and I heard submissions from both representatives on  the  merits
    of the Art 8 appeals.

11. In the light of Mr Diwnycz's position, it is not necessary to expand at
    length upon the error of law in the judge's determination.  It suffices
    to say this.  The Court of Appeal in MM and  Others  decided  that  the
    minimum  income  requirements  in  Appendix  FM  were  not  necessarily
    inconsistent with Art 8 of the ECHR.  In  that  regard,  the  Court  of
    Appeal reversed the decision of Blake J  in  the  Administrative  Court
    ([2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin)).  As the Court of Appeal noted at  [164]  of
    its judgment, it was not concerned  with  the  "individual  cases"  and
    whether the new minimum income requirements  produced  a  harsh  result
    such that there were "exceptional circumstances"  which  established  a
    breach of Art 8.

12. In that regard, therefore, Judge Khan misunderstood the effect  of  the
    Court of Appeal's decision in MM and Others and was wrong  to  conclude
    that the appellants' appeals necessarily had to be dismissed because of
    that decision.  As was common ground before me, Judge Khan should  have
    considered Art 8 and, in particular,  whether  there  were  "compelling
    circumstances" such that the decisions produced an unjustifiably  harsh
    consequence for the appellants (see R (Nagre) v SSHD  [2013]  EWCA  720
    (Admin); MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 and Singh and  Khalid
    v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 74).

13. Consequently, I am satisfied that Judge Khan erred in law in dismissing
    the appellants' appeals under Art 8.   Those  decisions  cannot  stand.
    They are set aside and I now move to remake the decisions.

    Re-making the Decisions

14. The appellants rely exclusively upon Art 8.  They argue that  it  is  a
    disproportionate interference with the respect for  their  family  life
    with the sponsor to preclude them from living with him in the UK.

15. In applying Art 8, I adopt the five stage test set out in  R(Razgar)  v
    SSHD [2004] UKHL 27 by Lord Bingham of Cornhill at [17].  Lord  Bingham
    was considering Art 8 in the  context  of  removal  decisions  but,  in
    principle, subject to linguistic adjustments the same principles  apply
    in entry clearance cases.  There, Lord Bingham identified the following
    five questions which I summarise as follows:

      1) Will the proposed removal be an interference by a public  authority
         with the exercise of the  applicant's  right  to  respect  for  his
         private or family life?;

      2) If so, will that interference have consequences of such gravity  as
         potentially to engage the operation of Art 8?;

      3) If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?;

      4) If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic society for a
         legitimate aim set out in Art 8.2?; and

      5) If so, is such interference proportionate to the legitimate  public
         aim sought to be achieved?

16. The burden of proof is upon the appellants to establish on a balance of
    probabilities that their Art 8 rights are engaged.  Thereafter,  it  is
    for the respondent to justify any interference  (or  disrespect).   The
    Art 8 issue must be determined on the facts and circumstances  as  they
    were at the date of decision, namely 28 June 2013 (see, s.85A(2) of the
    NIA Act 2002).

17. The essential facts are not in dispute.  None of Judge Khan's  findings
    of primary fact were challenged before me.

18. The sponsor married the  first  appellant  in  China  in  January  1993
    although it was not registered until 2012.

19. The sponsor came to the UK in 2000.  He did not return again  to  China
    until January 2012 and then did so again in 2013 and 2014 to visit  his
    wife and son.

20. Judge Khan accepted that the marriage between the first  appellant  and
    sponsor was a genuine and subsisting one and that they intended to live
    together  permanently.   Likewise,  it  was  not  suggested  that   the
    relationship between the second appellant and sponsor was other than  a
    genuine one of parent and child.

21. The sponsor was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK  in  2010.
    However, it is not clear from the  papers  and  neither  representative
    addressed me on this issue as to what  was  the  sponsor's  immigration
    status between 2000 when he came to the UK and 2010 when he was granted
    ILR.

22. I have already alluded to the sponsor's financial position and that  he
    earned �12,162.47  in  the  relevant  year  immediately  preceding  the
    application which was  over  �10,000  short  of  the  required  minimum
    financial requirement of �22,400 under  the  Rules.   It  was  accepted
    before me that the appellants could not succeed under the Rule  because
    of this.

23. Judge Khan also accepted that the second appellant  could  not  succeed
    under Art 8, he would in the future have to make an application  as  an
    adult having reached the age of 18, and the effect  would  be  that  he
    would be unlikely to obtain entry clearance.

24. On the basis  of  the  evidence  and  these  facts,  I  find  that  the
    appellants have established "family life" with the sponsor.  Further, I
    am satisfied that the refusal of entry clearance would  interfere  with
    that family life if the appellants are not allowed to join the sponsor.
     Consequently, I am satisfied that Art 8.1 is engaged. (On private life
    see below.)

25. As regards Art 8.2, the ECO's decisions are clearly in accordance  with
    the law, namely the Immigration Rules.  Further, the decisions pursue a
    legitimate aim, namely the economic wellbeing of the country.

26. The crucial issue in these appeals is whether the interference  that  I
    have identified is proportionate.

27. In approaching that issue, I must strike a fair  balance  weighing  the
    public interest against the rights and interests of the appellants  and
    the sponsor (see, Razgar per Lord Bingham at  [20]  and  Beoku-Betts  v
    SSHD [2008] UKHL 39).  At the date of decision, namely 28 June 2013 the
    second appellant was no longer a child  as  he  had  reached  his  18th
    birthday on 4 June 2013 prior to the decision.   His  "best  interests"
    were not, therefore, engaged  on  the  basis  of  him  being  a  minor.
    Indeed, neither representative made any submission in  respect  of  the
    second appellant's best interests as such.

28. As the appellants cannot  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules,  as  I  noted  above,  they  must  establish  that   there   are
    "compelling" circumstances such that the  refusal  of  entry  clearance
    would produce an unjustifiably harsh consequence.

29. Further, in considering the issue  of  proportionality,  I  must  "have
    regard" to the statutory factors set out  s.117B  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

30. In his submissions, Mr Walsh relied upon a number of factors  which  he
    invited me to take into account  and  conclude  that  the  respondent's
    decisions were disproportionate.

31. First, he reminded me that the sponsor had been in the  UK  since  2000
    which was thirteen years at the date of decision.  Mr Walsh relied upon
    para 19 of the sponsor's statement dated  2  July  2014  in  which  the
    sponsor stated that it would be unreasonable to expect him to leave the
    UK and return to China.  That paragraph is as follows:

         "19. It would be unreasonable to expect me  to  leave  the  UK  and
             return back to China if my wife and  son's  refusal  of  their
             settlement application is upheld.  My life is in  the  UK  now
             and I have integrated into the local community  and  now  lead
             the British way of life.  I have a secure job,  secure  income
             and a secure home.  If I was expected to return  to  China  to
             join my family, I would lose all of this  stability  including
             the finance which is currently supporting my family.   I  have
             many friends in the UK who have been helpful and supported  me
             during difficult times.  Therefore my private life has been in
             the UK since the last 14 years and I should not be expected to
             return to China  to  live  there.   Moreover,  the  conditions
             attached to my permanent status require me to reside in the UK
             and not be absent for more than 2 years.  This  would  mean  I
             would have to travel back and forth to see my wife and  child,
             which is not only costly but unreasonable.  I  should  not  be
             expected to do this since it would interfere with  my  private
             life in the UK."

32. Secondly, Mr Walsh relied upon the fact that the relationships  between
    the first and second appellants on the one hand and the sponsor on  the
    other were genuine ones.

33. Thirdly, Mr Walsh submitted that the effect of refusing entry clearance
    to the second appellant would be to split up the  family  unit  because
    there was a reduced chance of the second appellant  succeeding  in  any
    future application as an adult.

34. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Diwnycz submitted that  the  separation
    between the sponsor and appellants was "elective".  He  submitted  that
    the sponsor had chosen to come to the UK and had left  both  appellants
    behind in China.  They were, he submitted living apart  out  of  choice
    and had been doing so for most of  the  second  appellant's  life.   Mr
    Diwnycz submitted that it was  not  disproportionate  to  refuse  entry
    clearance given that  the  appellants  lacked  the  required  financial
    resources under the Rules and there was no  requirement  to  facilitate
    their entry to the UK.

35. I accept that the sponsor has lived in the UK since 2000  and,  at  the
    date of decision, that was some thirteen years.  I accept, although  no
    specific submissions were made in relation to  this  that  he  will  no
    doubt have built up a private life in the  UK  over  those  years.   No
    submissions were, however, made as to the nature  and  extent  of  that
    private life.  However, I do not accept that it would  be  unreasonable
    to expect him to return to China to live with his wife  and  son.   The
    fact that he has ILR does not, in the circumstances of  these  appeals,
    lead me to conclude that it would be unreasonable for him  to  live  in
    China with his  family.   Given  that  he  has,  since  obtaining  ILR,
    returned to China on three occasions to spend time with this  family  I
    see no reason why he  could  not  do  so  on  a  permanent  basis.   No
    protection issues or other factors concerned with living in China  were
    raised apart,  that  is,  from  the  sponsor's  evidence  that  he  has
    integrated into the local community and has a secure  job,  income  and
    home.  Whilst he would, obviously, forego that security in the UK if he
    returned to China, there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that  he
    would not be able to financially and otherwise sustain his family  life
    there.

36. As Mr Diwnycz submitted, the  separation  between  the  appellants  and
    sponsor is entirely elective.  I was not told why the sponsor  came  to
    the UK in 2000 but whatever the reason was  he  remained  here  for  12
    years without visiting his family.  His  son  was  born  in  1995.   He
    therefore did not see his son between the ages of 5  and  17.   He  has
    only subsequently seen him on a few occasions when he has  returned  to
    China since obtaining ILR in 2010.  That is equally the case in respect
    of his relationship with his wife.  The first appellant and sponsor had
    no expectation when the sponsor came to the UK in 2000 that they  could
    continue their family life in the UK.

37. I accept Mr Walsh's submission that the second appellant will,  if  not
    granted entry clearance on this application, have a much reduced chance
    of obtaining entry clearance as an adult.  That, however, is not in  my
    judgment a significant factor.  The reason  why  the  second  appellant
    cannot succeed under the Rules in this application is  because  of  the
    minimum financial requirement reflecting the public interest  in  those
    coming  to  the  UK  having  sufficient  financial  means  to   support
    themselves.  The plain fact  of  the  matter  is  that  in  any  future
    application as an adult the requirements of  the  Rules,  which  it  is
    suggested the second appellant will have difficulty in meeting,  simply
    reflects a continuing, albeit different, aspect of the public interest,
    when the individual is an adult.  I do not consider that the fact  that
    the second appellant is unlikely to succeed in an application under the
    Rules in the future adds any significant weight  to  his  claim  to  be
    admitted as a result of  this  application  when  he  cannot  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules now.  In any event, he is now  an
    adult and either his mother can remain (as she has done since 2000)  in
    China or,  alternatively,  the  second  appellant  (now  aged  20)  can
    continue to live in China.  I was  not  directed  to  any  evidence  to
    suggest that he could not reasonably remain there.

38. In my view, therefore, it would  not  be  unreasonable  to  expect  the
    sponsor to return to China to continue his family life.  In any  event,
    if the family is, as Mr Walsh submitted, effectively separated I am not
    satisfied that there are any compelling circumstances to  outweigh  the
    public interest.  The fact of separation continues the status quo which
    the first appellants and sponsor elected to create.   They  have  lived
    apart for thirteen years on that basis.  No evidence was  drawn  to  my
    attention that that separation had produced any  demonstrable  harm  to
    the second appellant or the  first  appellant.   It  is,  no  doubt,  a
    difficult and challenging situation for  the  appellants  and  sponsor.
    However, it was their choice.

39. By virtue of s.117B(1) the maintenance of effective immigration control
    is in the public interest.  No submissions were made as to whether  the
    appellants could speak English  or  would  be  financially  independent
    given the sponsor's income of around  �12,000.   For  the  purposes  of
    s.117B(2) and (3) even if both are satisfied, that provides no positive
    right to come to the UK and does not diminish the  public  interest  in
    effective immigration control (see  Forman  (ss.117A-C  considerations)
    [2015] UKUT 412 (IAC)).  Likewise, to the extent that s.117B(4) and (5)
    can be applied to the "private life" of the sponsor, I was not told  of
    his immigration status between 2000 and 2010.  However, at best it  was
    "precarious" and so by virtue of s.117B(5) "little  weight"  is  to  be
    given to his private life established at that time.

40. Consequently, whether the sponsor returns to China (as I find it  would
    be reasonable for him to do) or continues to remain in the UK as he has
    done so since 2000, I am not  satisfied  that  there  are  "compelling"
    circumstances such that  the  consequences  to  the  first  and  second
    appellants of being refused entry clearance is unjustifiably harsh.

41. For these reasons, the appellants have not established that at the date
    of decision the ECO's decisions to refuse them entry clearance breached
    Art 8 of the ECHR.

Decision

42. The decisions of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  each  of  the
    appellants' appeals under Art 8 involved the making of an error of law.
     Those decisions are set aside.

43. I remake the decisions dismissing each of the appellants' appeals under
    Art 8 of the ECHR and, as is accepted, under the Immigration Rules.
