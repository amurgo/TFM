For the Appellants:    Mr J Collins, instructed by G Singh Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is a resumed hearing. In my decision dated  4  September  2018,  I
    found that First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Housego  had  erred  in  law  in
    dismissing the Appellants' appeals on human rights grounds.
 2. The decision of 31 July 2017 was set aside and the appeal adjourned, to
    be reheard on the single issue of whether it  would  be  reasonable  to
    expect the third Appellant to  leave  the  UK.  The  judge's  remaining
    findings were preserved, in particular, the first Appellant submitted a
    false English language certificate in a previous  application  and  the
    first and second Appellants could not satisfy  the  Immigration  Rules.
    Their Article 8 claims were totally dependent on  the  third  Appellant
    establishing that it would be unreasonable for him to leave the UK.  In
    response to directions the Appellants submitted a bundle  of  93  pages
    and a skeleton argument. There was no  oral  evidence  and  the  appeal
    proceeded on submissions only.

 3. The Appellants are nationals of India born on 15 September 1974, 8 July
    1974 and 18 February 2005. The first Appellant  entered  the  UK  on  5
    November 2006 with leave to enter as a religious worker. The second and
    third Appellants, his wife and  son,  subsequently  joined  him  on  28
    September 2008. On 29 October 2015 the Appellants applied for leave  to
    remain. This was refused in a decision dated 11 February 2016  and  the
    appeal was dismissed by Judge Housego. The third Appellant was  now  13
    years old and had been living in the UK for  ten  years.  His  parents'
    application was refused on suitability grounds because his  father  had
    used deception in an application for leave to remain.  He  had  used  a
    proxy test taker and submitted a false English language certificate.

Appellant's submissions

4.   Mr Collins referred me to  page  10  of  the  Appellants'  bundle,  the
    letter from the third Appellant's school which  stated  "P  is  clearly
    well settled in our  school,  enjoys  his  studies  and  achieves  good
    grades. Were he to be relocated now, this would be detrimental  to  his
    education and would certainly disrupt his progress".  Mr  Collins  also
    relied on the report of an independent social worker dated 6  September
    2017 in which she concluded:

         "P's parents are meeting  his  needs,  he  has  accommodation,  his
         parents present  as  financially  independent,  he  has  access  to
         education, he has positive relationships with wider family  members
         in the UK, he is able to practise his faith and  he  has  developed
         positive friendships with his peers in and  out  of  school.  P  is
         achieving academically, and this is evidenced in his school reports
         and documents, along with the information provided by AP, P's  form
         tutor of three years at H Grammar School. P is now at an  important
         stage academically. AP expressed concern that if P were to relocate
         now, it would be detrimental to his education and  would  certainly
         disrupt his  progress.  P  has  expressed  the  importance  of  his
         friendships and the academic support he gains from his  cousins  in
         the United Kingdom which contributes to his education, learning and
         development.  P  presented  as  a  pleasant,  polite  and   quietly
         confident young person who has developed positive morals and values
         that he would have  learnt  not  only  from  his  parents  but  his
         experience of growing up in the UK and wider society, as  reflected
         in the policy documents of H Grammar School. P  lacks  independence
         skills, this raises questions  about  how  he  would  cope  with  a
         complete change of culture and environment in the event that he was
         to relocate to India at this time. P is currently having  treatment
         in relation to hearing loss in his right  ear  and  is  also  being
         monitored for his dental health. Overall, I have  formed  the  view
         that P's life chances and opportunities will be reduced if he  were
         forced to relocate to India at this time. It is my  view  that  P's
         current circumstances should be maintained at this time,  in  order
         that he has the  opportunity  to  achieve  the  Five  Outcomes  for
         children and young people identified  in  The  Children  Act  2004,
         Every Child Matters, that is, 'to Be Healthy, Stay Safe, Enjoy  and
         Achieve,  Make  a  Positive  Contribution  and   Achieve   Economic
         Wellbeing'".

5.   Mr Collins submitted that the third Appellant had spent little time  in
    India. It was noted in the social worker's report that there  had  been
    three visits to India, but he could only remember one of them. He  left
    India when he was three years old and has lived in the UK  ever  since.
    Considering the concerns of his form teacher and the social worker,  it
    was necessary to balance the conduct of the first  Appellant  with  the
    best interests of the third Appellant, applying  MA  (Pakistan)  [2016]
    EWCA Civ 705. The first Appellant had been found to  have  submitted  a
    false English language certificate,  but  other  than  that  there  was
    nothing adverse in his immigration history and no criminal offences. He
    and his wife, the second Appellant,  had  been  productive  members  of
    society during their time in the UK. The conduct of the first Appellant
    was not a powerful enough reason to outweigh the best interests of  the
    third  Appellant.  The   family   were   productive   and   financially
    independent. The third Appellant was almost 14 and had lived in the  UK
    for ten years. He was settled in education and integrated in the UK. He
    had close family ties with his cousins, aunts and uncles. It was in the
    third Appellant's best interests to remain in the UK and  it  would  be
    unreasonable for him to return to India with his parents.

6.   It was submitted that the Appellants'  submissions  were  supported  by
    the decision of a presidential panel of the Upper Tribunal in MT and ET
    (child's best interests; ex tempore pilot)  Nigeria  [2018]  UKUT  0088
    (IAC).

         "30.     The fact that ET's best interests do so lie is,  we  find,
             manifest.  In this regard, we entirely agree with and  endorse
             Judge Martin's findings on this issue in her decision. ET  has
             been in the UK for over ten years. She arrived here  when  she
             was only 4.  She is well advanced in  her  education  in  this
             country.  As a 14 year old, she can  plainly  be  expected  to
             have established significant social contacts involving friends
             in school and outside (such as the church).  She has  embarked
             on a course of studies leading to the taking of GCSEs.


         31.      Conversely,  ET  has  no  direct  experience  of  Nigeria.
             Whether or not there is a functioning education system in that
             country, her best interests, in terms of  Section  55  of  the
             2009 Act, manifestly lie in remaining in  the  United  Kingdom
             with her mother rather  than,  as  the  Respondent  contended,
             returning to Nigeria with her mother. A  much  younger  child,
             who has not started school or who has only  recently  done  so
             will have  difficulty  in  establishing  that  her  Article  8
             private and family life has a  material  element,  which  lies
             outside her need to live with her parent or parents,  wherever
             that may be.  This position, however, changes over time,  with
             the result that an assessment of best interests must  adopt  a
             correspondingly wider focus, examining the child's position in
             the wider world, of which school will usually be an  important
             part.


         32.      That is why both the age of the child and  the  amount  of
             time spent by the child in the United Kingdom will be relevant
             in determining, for the  purposes  of  Section  55/Article  8,
             where the best interests of the child lie.


         33.  On the present state of the law, as set out in MA, we need  to
             look for 'powerful reasons' why a child who has  been  in  the
             United  Kingdom  for  over  ten  years  should   be   removed,
             notwithstanding that her best interests lie in remaining.


         34.  In the present case, there are no such  powerful  reasons.  Of
             course, the public interest lies in removing a person, such as
             MT, who has abused the immigration laws of the United Kingdom.
             Although Mr Deller did not seek to rely on it,  we  take  into
             account the fact that, as recorded in Judge Baird's  decision,
             MT had, at some stage, received a community order for using  a
             false document to obtain employment. But, given  the  strength
             of ET's case, MT's conduct in our view comes nowhere close  to
             requiring the Respondent to succeed  and  Mr  Deller  did  not
             strongly urge us to find so. Mr Nicholson submitted that, even
             on the  findings  of  Judge  Martin,  MT  was  what  might  be
             described as a somewhat run of the mill  immigration  offender
             who came to the United Kingdom on a  visit  visa,  overstayed,
             made a claim for asylum that was found to be false and who has
             pursued various legal means of remaining in the UK.   None  of
             this is to be taken in any way as excusing or downplaying MT's
             unlawful behaviour. The point is that her immigration  history
             is not so bad as to constitute the kind of  'powerful'  reason
             that would render reasonable the removal of ET to Nigeria".

7.   Mr Collins submitted that, in the case of MT and ET, the  child's  best
    interests outweighed the public interest notwithstanding  her  mother's
    poor immigration history and the commission of a criminal  offence.  In
    this case the first Appellant had not been convicted  of  any  criminal
    offences, although he had been found to have used a proxy test taker in
    an English language test. This was not a powerful reason sufficient  to
    outweigh the best interests of the third Appellant.

Respondent's submissions

8.   Mr Bramble accepted that the third Appellant's best interests  were  to
    remain in the UK but submitted that this must be balanced  against  his
    parents' behaviour. He acknowledged that a community order in the  case
    of MT had not been considered to be a powerful reason. However, in  the
    present case, the first Appellant had used a proxy test taker and  used
    deception in a previous application. This was a  powerful  reason.  The
    test was taken in 2012 and the last application for leave to remain was
    in October 2015. If the deception had been discovered sooner, then  the
    Appellants would not have had their leave extended. Significant  weight
    should be attached to this deception  because  it  had  lengthened  the
    period of the Appellants' stay in the UK.

Appellant's response

9.   Mr Collins  submitted  that,  although  the  use  of  deception  was  a
    powerful reason, when considered in the round it was  very  detrimental
    to the third Appellant to leave the UK  after  residing  here  for  ten
    years and that powerful reason was not sufficient to outweigh his  best
    interests.

Discussion and Conclusion

10.  The  Appellants'  application  for  leave  to  remain  was  refused  on
    suitability grounds on the basis that  the  first  Appellant  had  used
    deception in an application for leave to remain in submitting  a  false
    English language certificate. He had used a proxy  test  taker  in  his
    English language test.  The  first  Appellant  came  to  the  UK  as  a
    religious worker and had also worked as  a  truck  driver.  The  second
    Appellant was his dependant.

11.  The third Appellant is now 13 years old and has been living in  the  UK
    for ten years.  He is well settled in school  and  passed  an  entrance
    exam in order to get to grammar school. He has  made  three  visits  to
    India since he came to the UK aged three. He  has  grandparents,  aunts
    and uncles in India. He also has aunts, uncles and cousins  in  the  UK
    and they have a very close bond. It is apparent from reading the social
    worker's report that the third Appellant depends on his cousins in  the
    UK to assist him with his school  work.  There  were  concerns  that  a
    relocation at this stage would be detrimental to his education and  his
    lack of 'independence skills' raised the question about  how  he  would
    cope with a complete change of culture and  environment  in  the  event
    that he had to relocate to India. The third Appellant  speaks  Punjabi,
    the language which is spoken at home, and he has been brought up and is
    familiar with Indian culture.

12.  Taking all these factors into account, I find that it is in  the  third
    Appellant's best interests to remain in the UK. He has lived  here  for
    the majority of his life and has little recollection of India.  He  can
    only remember his latest visit there. He has strong ties to his  family
    in the UK and he has also developed relationships outside  his  parents
    and family, making  friendships  in  school  and  outside  school.  His
    Article 8  rights  attract  significant  weight  given  his  length  of
    residence in the UK.

13.  I acknowledge that, had  the  deception  been  discovered  earlier,  it
    might have resulted in leave being curtailed.  Therefore,  the  use  of
    deception was in some way responsible for lengthening  the  Appellants'
    stay in the UK. Save for that deception, the third Appellant's  parents
    have made legitimate applications to remain in the  UK  lawfully.  They
    are financially independent, and they have  in  some  ways  integrated,
    despite their lack of English language skills.

14.  I am not bound by the decision of MT and ET but  I  find  it  extremely
    persuasive. The Appellant in that case  had  a  very  poor  immigration
    history. She entered the UK as a  visitor,  overstayed,  made  a  false
    asylum claim and then was convicted and sentenced to a community  order
    for using false documents.

15.  The Appellant's immigration history in this case was  nowhere  near  as
    bad and, whilst the use of deception in a  previous  application  could
    not be condoned, it was not a sufficiently powerful reason to  outweigh
    the third Appellant's best interests, applying MA (Pakistan).  Whilst I
    accept that using deception in a previous  application  for  leave  can
    amount to a powerful reason, on the particular facts of this  case,  it
    is not sufficient to outweigh the third Appellant's best  interests  or
    his Article 8 rights.

16.  On the totality of the evidence, I find that the third Appellant  is  a
    qualifying child and it would be unreasonable for him to leave the  UK.
    He satisfies the requirements of 276ADE(1)(iv) of the Immigration Rules
    and his removal from the UK would breach Article 8.   Applying  section
    117B(6) of the 2002 Act, the  public  interest  does  not  require  the
    removal of the first and second Appellants.  I  allow  the  Appellants'
    appeals on human rights grounds.
