                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This appeal comes before the Tribunal  pursuant  to  leave  granted  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Peter Lane, on 1st May  2013,  for  the  following
    reasons:

         "1.   I do not consider there is any merit at all in Ground 1.  The
         First-tier  Tribunal  judge  was   obliged   to   investigate   the
         ramifications of this unusual  case,  which  arguably  neither  the
         appellant's representatives nor the respondent had  properly  done.
         Ground 3 is likewise devoid of merit.  The learning on section 8 of
         the 2004 Act is not that judicial fact-finders are  precluded  from
         regarding as significant one or more credibility  issues  mentioned
         in it; merely that they should not regard themselves  as  compelled
         to do so, merely as a result of those  issues  falling  within  the
         scope of that section.

         2.   Grounds 4 and 5 touch on what is arguably an error: namely, to
         examine the effect of the apparent  acceptance  by  the  respondent
         that the appellant is already a refugee, qua Nigeria.  A glance  of
         the Refugee Convention makes it plain that a refugee is entitled to
         expect certain treatment from third party States, not least not  to
         be refouled to the country of nationality etc. Arguably, the  judge
         could not properly determine  the  appeal  without  at  least  some
         attempt being made to ascertain (a) whether the appellant still had
         refugee status; and (b) on what basis he was accorded that  status.
         If one or more of the reasons  for  being  granted  refugee  status
         overlapped with the  appellant's  claimed  fears  of  returning  to
         Nigeria, the appellant's credibility would arguably have needed  to
         be assessed against this background.  This  would,  of  course,  be
         different, if there were no prospect of removing the  appellant  to
         Nigeria; but the respondent's decision indicates that this  is,  in
         fact, a possibility.

         3.   The parties  must  be  prepared  to  assist  the  Tribunal  by
         providing  it  with  all   relevant   information   regarding   the
         appellant's refugee status and the  reasons  why  such  status  was
         granted by the Italian authorities.

         4.   For completeness, permission is also granted on ground 2."

 2. The appellant's  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  against  a
    decision by the respondent, made on 26th June 2012, to remove him  from
    the United Kingdom to Nigeria or Italy, following the  refusal  of  his
    asylum and human rights claims. First-tier Tribunal Judge S Taylor  did
    not believe the appellant's claim that he would suffer serious harm  on
    return to Nigeria from members of the Ogboni cult, due  to  him  having
    abandoned the cult.  He did not believe his claim to  fear  persecution
    on account of  his  homosexuality  and  he  did  not  accept  that  the
    appellant would be unable to receive appropriate medical  treatment  in
    Nigeria or Italy for his medical condition.  He also took the view that
    the removal of the appellant from the United Kingdom would  not  amount
    to a disproportionate breach of his right to respect  for  his  private
    life, there being no family life, in the United Kingdom under article 8
    of the ECHR.

 3. Grounds 4 and 5 of the grounds of appeal complained of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  judge's  approach  in  relation  to  the  assessment  of  the
    appellant's private life and also of his approach in  relation  to  the
    assessment of whether the appellant was a homosexual.   Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Peter Lane granted permission on the basis that the appellant had
    been recognised as a  refugee  in  Italy.  The  difficulty  facing  the
    appellant is that it was never  his  case  that  he  had  been  granted
    refugee status in Italy.  In paragraph  12  of  his  witness  statement
    dated 26th February 2013, which  was  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    judge he said he arrived in Italy in the middle of 1993.  In  paragraph
    13 he said he did not seek asylum because he did not know what it  was,
    nor did he have anyone to assist him.   In  paragraph  14  he  said  he
    remained in Italy from 1993 until  2005.   He  said  in  1995/1996  the
    Italian government had given an amnesty for overstayers who  were  able
    to secure a sponsor.  He applied and received his residence permit  and
    in 2001 he received his permanent residence in Italy.  In paragraph  15
    he said thereafter he remained in Italy  and  continued  working  as  a
    sales assistant in the local stores.

 4. It is clear from the record of the appellant's asylum interview,  which
    took place on 9th February 2012, that the appellant never claimed  that
    he had applied for and been granted refugee status in Italy.  In answer
    to questions about his status in Italy he said initially he was illegal
    after arriving there from France at the end of 1993 or in 1994. He said
    he obtained a working visa for 4 years and then was granted  indefinite
    leave in 2001.

 5. Moreover the appellant produced a foreigner's permit of stay dated  2nd
    January 2002 which indicated that he had a permanent right of residence
    in Italy.  The form dealt with a number  of  details  relating  to  the
    appellant.  Against the word "refugee" there was  the  entry  "niente".
    The  form  indicated  that  his  previous  stay  had  been  as  "lavoro
    subordinato" and his means of support  was  "da  lavoro".   Ms  Physsas
    sought to argue that because there was an entry on the  document  which
    suggested that it was valid until 4th February 2007, the  appellant  no
    longer had indefinite leave to remain in Italy and  therefore  was  not
    removable to Italy. That would, however, be a contradiction  in  terms.
    In our view the fact that the document might need to be renewed did not
    affect the appellant's status in Italy, just as the need for a  British
    national to renew a passport does not affect his status.  Moreover,  as
    Mr Melvin pointed out, the appellant also produced an Italian  identity
    card, issued on 9th May 2005, which was valid until 8th May 2010.   The
    appellant would have been likely to have been issued with  an  identity
    card which ran beyond the limit of any leave that he had  been  granted
    to remain in Italy.

 6. In any event the issue of whether the appellant could  be  returned  to
    Italy was never raised at the First-tier Tribunal.  The respondent  had
    power to direct his return to Italy under section 10 of the Immigration
    and Asylum 1999 Act with reference to paragraph 8(1)(c) of  Schedule  2
    to the Immigration Act 1971 as a country in which  he  had  obtained  a
    document of identity, a country in which he  embarked  for  the  United
    Kingdom or a country where there was reason to believe that he would be
    admitted.  Any issue as to whether the appellant could be  returned  to
    Italy would not have affected the issue which the  First-tier  Tribunal
    judge  had  to  determine,  namely  whether  if,  hypothetically,   the
    appellant were to be returned to Italy, he would be at a real  risk  of
    persecution for Refugee Convention.

 7. We therefore take the view that the statement in paragraph  58  of  the
    letter of refusal, dated 22nd June 2012, that it  was  noted  that  the
    appellant was previously granted refugee status and indefinite leave to
    remain in Italy was a mistake.   Insofar  as  the  statement  that  the
    appellant was previously granted refugee status in Italy is  concerned,
    the appellant cannot possibly have been prejudiced  by  that  statement
    because it contained an assertion that was  directly  contrary  to  the
    case that he advanced before the First-tier Tribunal judge.   In  these
    circumstances the basis upon which  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Peter  Lane
    granted permission to  appeal  in  respect  of  grounds  4  and  5  was
    mistaken.

 8. Ms Physsas submitted that the First-tier Tribunal judge was  wrong,  in
    paragraph  25  of  his  determination,  to  say  that  the   background
    information showed that permanent residence  in  Italy  might  only  be
    revoked after an absence of twelve years.  In our view  that  point  is
    immaterial because the appellant had not demonstrated at the hearing of
    his appeal that his right of permanent residence had been revoked,  nor
    had he adduced  any  evidence  to  counter  that  referred  to  by  the
    respondent in the refusal letter.

 9. Ms Physsas also sought to argue that there was ongoing  litigation,  as
    she put it, relating to whether removal to Italy of  persons  to  Italy
    who had refugee status there would amount to a breach of  their  rights
    under article 3 of the ECHR, but, as  she  herself  acknowledged,  this
    formed no part of the appellant's case before the  First-tier  Tribunal
    and indeed permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was not sought on
    any such ground.  In these circumstances it is difficult to see how  it
    could be arguable that the First-tier Tribunal judge made an  error  of
    law in this respect.

10. Although, as we have indicated, the basis  upon  which  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Lane granted permission to appeal in relation to grounds 4 and  5
    has disappeared,  nonetheless, Ms Physsas  sought  to  argue  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal judge had made errors in relation to the assessment
    of  the  appellant's  article  8  claim.   In  paragraph  23   of   his
    determination the First-tier Tribunal judge said that the appellant had
    provided no evidence of employment in the United  Kingdom  although  he
    stated he had previously being working.  Ms Physsas pointed to payslips
    issued  by  I-Pay  Limited  and  addressed  to  the  appellant   dated,
    respectively, 26th August 2007, 9th September 2007 and  23rd  September
    2007 which had been supplied the  respondent.   The  first  showed  net
    payment of �213.03, the second of �171.62 and the third of �222.31, the
    latter being in respect of two weeks' employment.  It  would  therefore
    appear that there was evidence that the appellant had been employed for
    a period of four weeks in August/September 2007.  She also pointed  out
    that in paragraph 23 of his determination the First-tier Tribunal judge
    said that the appellant had not been on a course of study in the United
    Kingdom.  Ms Physsas drew to our attention to a letter  from  the  LVMT
    Business School, dated 26th November 2007,  which  confirmed  that  the
    appellant had enrolled at the college on  a  Part  1/2  (ACCA)  course.
    There was, however, no evidence that the  appellant  actually  embarked
    upon such a course.  It is significant that the appellant himself  made
    no mention of his employment or any studies in his witness statement.

11. In paragraph 23 of his determination the First-tier Tribunal judge said
    that he found that when the appellant's leave expired in 2003  he  made
    no attempt to regularise his stay in the United Kingdom until 2008  and
    had remained without leave since the refusal of that  application.   Ms
    Physsas submitted that that was incorrect  because  the  appellant  had
    arrived in the United Kingdom in 2005.

12. In paragraph 23 of his determination the First-tier tribunal judge  had
    found that the appellant's credibility was further  diminished  by  his
    vague and unsupported account of his history in the United Kingdom,  in
    particular with regard to his documents and  his  alleged  attempts  to
    return to Italy.  This was based on the fact that the appellant claimed
    that he had lost his documents when he was  running  away  following  a
    bomb explosion at Shepherds Bush Underground Station,  after  which  he
    reported the loss to the police and was given a police incident report.
    The First-tier Tribunal judge, however,  recorded  that  the  Shepherds
    Bush bomb explosion on took place on 21st  July  2005  and  the  police
    report submitted by the appellant concerning the loss of his  documents
    was dated 12th October 2007, some two and a half years later.

13. It is apparent in the error made by the First-tier Tribunal judge as to
    the date the appellant's leave expired in 2003 was not material to  the
    outcome of the appeal, because in the same  paragraph  it  is  recorded
    that the appellant had been in the  United  Kingdom  for  eight  years,
    which clearly involved an acknowledgment that he had come to the United
    Kingdom in 2005.  We share the view of Mr Melvin that even if the First-
    tier Tribunal judge made  an  error  in  relation  to  the  four  weeks
    employment of which the appellant had supporting evidence,  nonetheless
    during a period of eight years that was the only period  of  employment
    that the appellant provided evidence of having undertaken. It  was  the
    case that the appellant made no attempt to regularise his stay  in  the
    United Kingdom until 2008, when he applied for an  EU  residence  card.
    The letter of refusal recorded that on 14th January 2008 he applied for
    an EEA residence card but this was refused on 1st  December  2008.   On
    27th July 2010 he applied for leave outside the  immigration  rules  on
    compassionate grounds  but  that  was  refused  on  10th  August  2010.
    Following his arrest on 22nd December 2011 he claimed asylum,  on  25th
    December 2011.

14. Ms Physsas submitted that the First-tier Tribunal  judge  had  made  an
    error in not taking account of the appellant's medical problems in  the
    United Kingdom as a reason for his failure to seek  to  regularise  his
    stay here.  It appears from the medical evidence before the  First-tier
    Tribunal judge that the appellant had a problem with  his  kidneys  for
    which he first received medical treatment in 2006.  In paragraph 22  of
    his determination the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  recorded  that  the
    appellant claimed he had been unable to obtain new documents until 2007
    due  to  hospital  appointments.  He  observed  that  if,  indeed,  the
    appellant had lost his documents in July 2005 he had offered no  reason
    why he could not have obtained replacement documents by  October  2005.
    He said after the appellant left hospital in 2006 he was monitored once
    a month and then once in three months, but again he offered  no  reason
    why he could not have resolved his  position  during  that  period.  He
    found the appellant's account with regard to his lost documents and his
    attempts to return to Italy totally lacked credibility.

15. Ms Physsas also submitted that the First-tier Tribunal  judge  did  not
    expressly find that the appellant's removal to Nigeria would not breach
    his article 8 rights but it is clear by reason of his finding that  the
    appellant could continue with his activities of helping the youth in  a
    church in Italy or Nigeria in paragraph 23 of his determination and his
    finding that he had submitted no evidence that  he  could  not  receive
    appropriate (medical) treatment in Italy and he  had  not  demonstrated
    that treatment would not be available in Nigeria in paragraph 24,  that
    he took the view that removal whether to Italy  or  Nigeria  would  not
    breach the appellant's article 8 rights.

16. Ground 4 asserted the First-tier Tribunal judge had  failed  to  assess
    the supporting evidence relating to the appellant's private life but in
    our view it is clear that  he  took  into  account  the  whole  of  the
    evidence in reaching his conclusions.  As he observed in  paragraph  23
    of his determination having a job and friends would be insufficient  to
    create a private life for the purposes of article 8 as  they  could  be
    recreated  elsewhere,   in  reliance  upon  the  determination  of  the
    Tribunal in MG (Serbia and Montenegro) [2005] UKAIT 113.  It  was  also
    said that the First-tier Tribunal judge failed to take account  of  the
    risk of suicide, the basis for which was an email, dated  7th  December
    2012, from the appellant to UKBA,  in  which  he  complained  of  being
    depressed, made reference to his asylum claim  and  said  he  was  even
    thinking of giving up his life. In our view the appellant had not  laid
    the necessary evidential basis upon which it  could  be  said  that  he
    remotely approached satisfying  the  necessary  criteria  in  order  to
    demonstrate a risk of suicide if he were to be removed from the  United
    Kingdom.

17. In the light of these matters we take the view that there is nothing to
    the complaints about the First-tier Tribunal judge's assessment of  the
    appellant's private life and nothing in  the  evidence  to  demonstrate
    that the appellant's return to Nigeria  or  Italy  would  amount  to  a
    breach of his right to respect for  his  private  life  in  the  United
    Kingdom under article 8 of the ECHR.

18. Ground 2, a ground in respect of which permission was granted, asserted
    that the First-tier Tribunal judge failed to give appropriate weight to
    the oral evidence of Mr Sampson Essien.  The appellant had confided  in
    him that he was gay in 2009.  In paragraph 14 of his determination  the
    First-tier Tribunal judge recorded his  evidence  at  the  hearing,  in
    which he made reference to  his  letter  of  support.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal judge said that in summary the letter stated the appellant had
    told him in 2009 that he was gay.  He believed the appellant because he
    came round with his partner and confirmed their relationship.

19. In paragraph 16 of his determination, in dealing with  the  appellant's
    claimed fear of the Ogboni cult, the First-tier Tribunal judge recorded
    that the appellant felt he was able to return to Nigeria  not  only  at
    least three or four times but for one to three months at a time  up  to
    2004.  He said the appellant did  not  just  go  back  for  clandestine
    visits, but he returned to marry in 1998 and returned on  a  sufficient
    number of occasions to have four children, including a  set  of  twins.
    In paragraph 19 he recorded that the appellant claimed that he realised
    he was homosexual in 2008 or 2009 but he failed to claim asylum at that
    stage and did not claim asylum until some three years later, at the end
    of 2011 and only after he had been arrested on immigration  matters  at
    his place of work.  In addition, when he wrote a letter  outlining  his
    asylum claim, on  24th  December  2011,  he  made  no  mention  of  his
    sexuality or his relationships with men. In paragraph 20  he  said  the
    appellant claimed to have had three  homosexual  relationships  in  the
    United Kingdom since 2008, but had submitted very  little  evidence  in
    support of his claim. None of his claimed partners attended the hearing
    or provided a statement in support of the appeal.  In paragraph  21  he
    said the supporting witness was only able to  say  that  the  appellant
    attended his barber shop in the company of someone  who  the  appellant
    told him was his partner.  That in our view dealt sufficiently with the
    evidence of Mr Essien because it  involved  an  acknowledgment  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge that Mr Essien had said that he had been told
    by the appellant that he was homosexual and also that a person had been
     introduced to him as the appellant's  partner.   The  weight  of  that
    evidence was a matter for the First-tier Tribunal judge in the light of
    the evidence as a whole and in our view it cannot be said that he  gave
    it inappropriate weight.

20. In these  circumstances  we  are  not  satisfied  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal judge made a material error of law on a point of  law  in  his
    determination of the appeal and  therefore  his  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal is dismissed, so that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    shall stand.
