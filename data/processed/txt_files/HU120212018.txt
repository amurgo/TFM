                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of South Africa born on  10  November  1984.
    On 7 September 2015 she entered the UK with leave  as  the  wife  of  a
    British citizen valid until 29  April  2018.   On  13  April  2018  she
    applied on human rights grounds for leave to remain on the basis of her
    family life with her husband,  Mr  Richardson.   This  application  was
    refused on 16 May 2018.  The only ground for refusing  the  application
    was because the respondent did not accept that the  appellant  met  the
    financial  eligibility  requirements  (E-LTRP.3.1  to  E-LTRP.3.3)   of
    Appendix FM.

2.   The appellant appealed indicating that she wished for the  case  to  be
    determined on the papers.  The matter came before a First-tier Judge to
    be so determined on 26 July 2018.  In paragraph 6 of the  decision  the
    judge noted that directions had been issued  to  the  effect  that  the
    appellant must send any further evidence to the  Tribunal  by  18  July
    2018.  The judge recorded  that  the  Tribunal  had  not  received  any
    further papers from either party and was satisfied that he could fairly
    determine the appeal.

3.   The judge noted that  the  respondent  had  taken  no  issue  that  the
    appellant was in other than a genuine and subsisting  relationship  and
    the judge was  satisfied  accordingly,  having  referred  to  Razgar  v
    Secretary of State [2004] UKHL 27 that  Article  8  was  engaged.   The
    judge noted that the starting point when assessing proportionality  was
    whether the appellant met the Immigration Rules and referred to  Hesham
    Ali v Secretary of State [2016] UKSC 60 at paragraphs 39  to  43.   The
    judge accordingly turned to consider  whether  the  appellant  met  the
    requirements of the Rules and concluded his determination as follows:

         "15. The respondent noted that initially the Appellant  had  wished
             to  rely  on  savings,  but  subsequently  submitted   further
             evidence and asserted that she wished the  application  to  be
             considered  under  'Category  A'  (salaried  or   non-salaried
             employment where the applicant and or their partner have  been
             with their current employer for 6 months or more).


         16.   Under  E-LTRP.3.1,  the  Appellant  must  provide   specified
             evidence, from the sources listed in paragraph E-LTRP.3.2., of
             a gross annual income of at least �18,600.  Under Appendix FM-
             SE, for every employment relied on, the applicant must  submit
             wage slips and bank statements covering a period of six months
             prior to the  date  of  the  application.   In  addition,  the
             Appellant must provide an employer's letter.


         17.  The Respondent accepted that the Appellant  had  provided  the
             specified documents in relation to  her  employment  with  The
             Oakley Court Hotel and calculated a yearly  income  equivalent
             to �8692 from his employment.  The Appellant does not  dispute
             the Respondent's calculation.


         18.  As such, the Appellant is also reliant upon  any  income  from
             her partner's employment with Enagabia Engineering Company Ltd
             (the company).  The Respondent noted that although there  were
             payments made into the Appellant's partner's bank  account  in
             January and March 2018, the last payslip  submitted  with  the
             application was for December 2017.


         19.  The Respondent also noted the contents of two letters from the
             company, dated 12 and 19 April 2018.  In the first letter, the
             company stated that the Appellant's partner "was" an  employee
             of the company, but was made redundant  at  the  beginning  of
             2018.


         20.  The second letter confirmed that the company was in  voluntary
             liquidation and therefore no payslips have been  issued  since
             December 2017.


         21.   Accordingly,  the  Respondent  did  not   accept   that   the
             Appellant's partner was in  employment  at  the  date  of  the
             application and was eligible to apply under Category A.


         22.  In the grounds of appeal, the Appellant noted  that  they  had
             been advised that a letter from her partners'  employer  would
             be sufficient and that  is  why  they  had  not  provided  the
             payslips.  The Appellant added that they have now provided the
             payslips and P60  for  2017/18.   Unfortunately  although  the
             Notice of Appeal stated  that  the  documents  were  attached,
             copies of these documents were not forwarded to the Tribunal.


         23.  In any event, the Appellant  has  not  addressed  whether  her
             partner  was  still  in  employment,  when  she   lodged   the
             application.  In these circumstances, I accept the information
             set out in the letters from the company.  Accordingly, I  find
             that the Appellant's partner was not  an  employee,  when  the
             Appellant lodged the application and he was  not  eligible  to
             apply under Category A.  It follows that the Appellant  cannot
             rely on the income her partner earned from that employment.


         24.  On the totality of the evidence, I find that  the  Appellant's
             income  does  not  meet  the  Minimum  Income  Threshold   and
             therefore  she  does  not  meet  the  financial;   eligibility
             requirements of Appendix FM (E-LTRP.3.1).


         25.  I now consider whether Ex.1 applies.  The Appellant  does  not
             refer to having any dependent children.  As such Ex.1(a)  does
             not apply.  In relation to Ex.1(b), the Appellant confirmed on
             her application form that she has friends and family in  South
             Africa and that she has  travelled  to  South  Africa  several
             times, since coming to the UK in 2015.


         26.  The Appellant has not raised any factors to suggest the couple
             would entail very serious hardship, such that they  could  not
             live together in South Africa.


         27.  On the totality of the evidence, I find that the Appellant has
             not demonstrated that there are  insurmountable  obstacles  to
             family life with the Sponsor continuing outside the UK.


         28.  Accordingly, I find that  the  Appellant  does  not  meet  the
             requirements of Ex.1.  I also find that the Appellant does not
             meet the requirements of Appendix FM.


         29.  However, this is not determinative of the appeal.  The Supreme
             Court held in R (Agyarko v SSHD; R (Ikuga) v SSHD [2017]  UKSC
             11 that, if an applicant failed to meet  the  requirements  of
             the new Rules,


                  "...  it  should  only   be   in   genuinely   exceptional
                  circumstances that refusing them leave and  removing  them
                  from the UK would breach Article 8" (para 11).


         30.  The  respondent's  decision  may  effectively  mean  that  the
             Appellant and her partner's family unit  may  be  divided  and
             split between two countries.


         31.  However, Article 8 does not give an individual  the  right  to
             choose where they can live with their family.


         32.  Further, in accordance with section 117A of the  2002  Act,  I
             confirm that, when considering the public interest question, I
             have also had regard to the factors listed in section 117B  of
             the Act.  The Appellant was unable  to  demonstrate  that  the
             family income met the minimum income threshold under  appendix
             FM.  As such, the Appellant  has  not  demonstrated  that  the
             family would be financially independent.


         33.  In addition, the Appellant did not meet the immigration  rules
             and this is a matter that weighs heavily against her.


         34.  In any event, the couple would  have  been  fully  aware  that
             under the immigration rules they needed a  minimum  income  of
             �18,600 and that if did they did not earn  enough  money,  the
             Appellant is likely to have to return to South Africa.


         35.  Overall and on balance, I find  that  the  Appellant  has  not
             demonstrated that there are  compelling  considerations,  over
             and above the factors  covered  in  Appendix  FM,  that  would
             justify her being granted leave to remain in the UK.


         36.  On the totality of the evidence, I am satisfied that,  on  the
             particular facts  of  the  case,  the  interference  with  the
             Appellant and her partner's family life in the UK is necessary
             and  proportionate.   Their  rights  do   not   outweigh   the
             Respondent's legitimate interests  in  ensuring  economic  and
             social order, when maintaining effective immigration control."


4.   Accordingly, the judge dismissed the appeal.

5.   There was an application for permission to appeal.  With  reference  to
    what the judge had said in paragraph 22 of his  determination,  it  was
    maintained that the documents had indeed  accompanied  the  grounds  of
    appeal.  Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that  there  was
    proof of receipt of the  documents  on  29  May  2018.   The  documents
    included the sponsor's payslips and P60.  It appeared that for whatever
    reason the documents submitted under cover of the letter had  not  been
    placed before the Tribunal.   It  was  arguable  that  there  had  been
    procedural unfairness through no fault of the judge.   At  the  hearing
    Counsel relied on the grounds and submitted there had  been  unfairness
    and if documents were missing an opportunity should have been given  to
    lodge them.   The  application  had  only  been  refused  on  financial
    grounds.  Reference was made to MM (Lebanon) [2017] UKSC 10.

6.    Miss  Willocks-Briscoe  submitted  that  the  issue  was  whether  the
    appellant's husband was still in employment.  The judge had found  that
    the appellant was not in paragraph 23.  The payslips took the matter no
    further. The letters from the company were in the respondent's  bundle.
    The judge had found the appellant did not meet  the  Immigration  Rules
    and the appellant could not succeed on the principles  in  Chikwamba  v
    Secretary of State [2008] UKHL 40.  Miss Willocks-Briscoe  referred  to
    Chen (Appendix FM - Chikwamba - temporary separation - proportionality)
    IJR [2015] UKUT 189 - the instant appeal did not involve children.

7.   There was no issue of fairness since  the  appeal  was  bound  to  fail
    regardless of  the  missing  documents.   The  company  had  gone  into
    liquidation.

8.   Counsel submitted that it was a question  of  justice  being  done  and
    submitted that the missing documents did show that  the  appellant  was
    still an  employee  although  the  company  was  in  liquidation.   The
    appellant's husband was still getting a salary.  He was not a burden on
    the state.  The evidence had an impact on  the  decision  both  in  and
    outside the Rules.

9.   At the end of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I can of  course
    only interfere with the judge's determination if it was flawed in  law.
    The respondent noted that the last payslip submitted for the employment
    with Engabia Engineering Company Ltd was dated 31 December 2017  and  a
    letter from the company dated 19 April 2018 confirmed the  company  was
    in voluntary liquidation and accordingly no payslips  had  been  issued
    since December 2017.  The respondent also took into  account  a  letter
    from the company dated 12 April 2018 where it was  confirmed  that  the
    appellant's husband "was" an employee of Engabia  Engineering  Ltd  but
    was  made  redundant  at  the  beginning  of  2018.   Accordingly,  the
    appellant did not meet the relevant Rules at the time  of  lodging  the
    application.  The letter of 12 April 2018 from  the  company  makes  it
    clear that the appellant was made redundant at the beginning of 2018 as
    the company had gone into voluntary liquidation and the  appellant  had
    gone into a property business with the author of the letter.  There was
    reference to two  properties  the  income  from  which  would  be  paid
    directly to the  appellant's  husband.   In  the  letter  of  19  April
    reference was made to paying the appellant's husband in  cash  and  ten
    payslips were attached to the letter.

10.  While it is regrettable that the  judge  did  not  have  sight  of  the
    payslips that did not affect the outcome in this case as Miss Willocks-
    Briscoe  submitted.   The  appellant  could  not  meet   the   relevant
    requirements of the Rules because he was no longer an employee  of  the
    company.  I do not find that the omission  of  the  material  from  the
    evidence before the First-tier Judge caused unfairness  in  this  case.
    The judge was not obliged to make further enquiries about  the  missing
    material.  I do not find that the material had it been submitted  would
    have had any impact on the Appellant's  case  which  was  bound  to  be
    dismissed under the Rules and I reject the  submission  that  it  might
    have had an impact on the consideration of the case outside the Rules.

11.  I am not satisfied that the decision was materially flawed in  law  and
    this appeal is dismissed.

12.  The First-tier Judge made no anonymity direction and I make none.

Fee Award

13.  The First-tier Judge made no fee aware and I make none.
