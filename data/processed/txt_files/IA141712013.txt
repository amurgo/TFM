Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R Ahmed instructed by Dias Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision of Judge
    A D Baker promulgated on 17 October 2013 which allowed  the  claimant's
    appeal under the Immigration Rules and Art 8 of the ECHR.

 2. For convenience, I will hereafter refer to the parties as they appeared
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

Background

 3. The appellant is a citizen of the Philippines who was born  on  8  July
    1974.  She arrived in the UK on 20 May 2009 with leave  as  a  student.
    That leave was extended and her most recent grant of  leave  was  valid
    until 1 March 2013.

 4. On 9 June 2012, the appellant married Shey Barrett, a British  citizen.
    On 25 February 2013, she applied for leave to remain as a spouse  under
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).  On 16  April
    2013, the Secretary  of  State  refused  the  appellant's  application.
    First, the Secretary of State was not satisfied that the appellant  met
    the financial requirements in E-LTRP 3.1 in that she was  not  able  to
    demonstrate on the basis of specified evidence that she and her husband
    had a combined annual  income  of  at  least  �18,600.   Secondly,  the
    Secretary of State was not satisfied that para EX.1 applied.   Although
    it was not disputed that  her  relationship  with  her  husband  was  a
    "genuine and subsisting relationship", the Secretary of State  did  not
    accept that there were "insurmountable obstacles" to the appellant  and
    her husband continuing their family life outside the UK.  Thirdly,  the
    Secretary of State was not satisfied  that  the  requirements  of  para
    276ADE of the Rules (concerned with the appellant's private life)  were
    met in that she had not demonstrated that she had "no  ties  (including
    social, cultural or family)" with the Philippines.

The First-tier Tribunal's Decision

 5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  At that hearing, it
    was conceded by the appellant's representative that she could not  meet
    the financial requirements of the Rules by demonstrating  the  required
    income either at the  date  of  her  application  or  at  the  date  of
    decision.  However, the Secretary of State conceded  before  the  judge
    that the appellant did meet the  financial  requirements  of  the  Rule
    (namely demonstrating a  combined  gross  annual  income  of  at  least
    �18,600) at the date of the  hearing.   Given  that  concession,  Judge
    Baker allowed the appellant's appeal under the Rules.

 6. In addition, Judge Baker also allowed the appellant's appeal under  Art
    8.  At para  9  of  her  determination,  Judge  Baker  noted  that  the
    respondent did not challenge the evidence  concerning  the  appellant's
    health summarised at para 16 of the skeleton argument of the appellant,
    namely that:  "She is pregnant with a  child  who  will  be  a  British
    national and as she has suffered a miscarriage she is considered a high
    risk pregnancy."  Judge Baker concluded at para 10 of her determination
    that:  "Taking all these factors into account I  conclude  first  under
    the Immigration Rules and second under Art  8  of  the  ECHR  that  the
    appeal is to be allowed outright".

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 7. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  The grounds argued that the judge had erred in allowing  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules:  first, by looking at the facts  at
    the date of the hearing rather than at the date of the application; and
    secondly, in finding that the appellant met  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules without considering whether the evidence satisfied Appendix FM-SE
    of the Rules.  In addition, the  grounds  argued  that  the  judge  had
    failed properly  to  carry  out  the  balancing  exercise  inherent  in
    proportionality in finding in the appellant's favour under Art 8 of the
    ECHR.

 8. On 5 November 2013, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Brunnen) granted the
    Secretary of State permission to appeal.  Thus, the appeal came  before
    me.

The Submissions

 9. On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Richards adopted the grounds of
    appeal.

10. First, he submitted that the judge had erred in  law  in  allowing  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules on the basis of the  income  of  the
    appellant and her husband at the date of  the  hearing.   He  submitted
    that under Appendix FM-SE the appellant could only establish  that  she
    met the requirements of the Rules by providing the "specified evidence"
    in Appendix  FM-SE  which  required,  inter  alia,  the  submission  of
    payslips covering  a  period  of  six  months  prior  to  the  date  of
    application.  Mr Richards submitted that the financial requirements  of
    Appendix FM could, therefore, only be met by evidence relating to  that
    period prior to the date of application and the judge  had,  therefore,
    been wrong to allow the appeal under the Rules on the  basis  that  the
    appellant could demonstrate she met the financial requirements  of  the
    Rules at the date of hearing.

11. Secondly, Mr Richards submitted that the judge had failed  properly  to
    engage in the  balancing  exercise  under  Art  8.   She  had  made  no
    reference to the Rules.  He submitted that the  judge  had  set  out  a
    number of facts  on  the  side  of  the  appellant  including,  as  the
    Presenting Officer had accepted, that she was expecting a baby, a child
    who would be a British citizen and it was a high risk pregnancy if  she
    was required to leave the UK.  But, Mr Richards submitted the judge had
    not  taken  into  account  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet   the
    requirements of the Rules at the date of the application or indeed  the
    Secretary of State's decision.

12. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Ahmed submitted that there  was  nothing
    in the Rules to require an  assessment  of  the  appellant's  financial
    situation as at the date of application.  In any event, he referred  me
    to wage slips and other employment documents in the appellant's  bundle
    at pages 29-50 and at page 71 relating to the sponsor's employment  and
    at pages 145-152 in relation to the appellant's  employment.   Although
    Mr Ahmed acknowledged that  in  relation  to  both  the  appellant  and
    sponsor there was one document missing in  the  required  sequence,  on
    instructions he told me that these had been sent to the Home Office and
    the documents in the bundle were the only ones that had been  returned.
    He submitted that on a sensible view, at the date of  the  hearing  the
    appellant had demonstrated that she met the financial  requirements  of
    the Rules.

13. Mr Ahmed also relied upon the health of the sponsor and appellant.   As
    regards the sponsor, he suffers from epilepsy and he referred me  to  a
    number of documents in relation to his health at pages 267-271  of  the
    bundle.  In addition, by way  of  further  evidence,  he  relied  on  a
    discharge summary dated 31 December 2013 which showed that the  sponsor
    had been admitted  to  the  accident  and  emergency  department  of  a
    hospital in Exeter on 30 December 2013 having suffered  three  seizures
    and, indeed, suffered a further seizure whilst in hospital.

14. In relation to the appellant's health he referred me to the evidence in
    the bundle at pages 251 et seq showing that the appellant had  suffered
    a miscarriage in June 2012 and is currently pregnant again.  I was told
    that she is six months pregnant at present.  The appellant suffers from
    a condition known as Turner Syndrome which  is  caused  by  chromosomal
    abnormality.  An explanation of the condition is set out in the  letter
    from a Consultant Clinical Geneticist, Dr C Brewer in her letter to the
    appellant and her husband dated 7 January 2013 at pages 259-260 of  the
    bundle.  That letter indicates  that  the  appellant  suffers  from  "a
    partial, or mild form of Turner Syndrome".

15. Mr Ahmed submitted that, on the basis of the  evidence,  all  that  was
    required of the judge was to give somewhat fuller reasoning under Art 8
    and the appeal was properly then allowed.  He submitted that  it  would
    clearly be disproportionate or there would be insurmountable  obstacles
    under EX.1 to the appellant and her  husband  continuing  their  family
    life in the Philippines.

16. Mr Ahmed submitted that the judge's decision should be upheld  but,  if
    there were any error of law, he invited me to allow  the  appeal  under
    Art 8 on the facts.

17. In relation to that last matter, Mr  Richards  indicated  that  he  was
    content for me to remake the decision on  the  basis  of  the  evidence
    before me.

Discussion and Findings

18. The evidence in this  appeal  is  uncontested.   The  evidence  of  the
    appellant is set out in her statement dated 24 September 2013 at  pages
    3-7 of the bundle and the evidence of her husband is  set  out  in  his
    statement dated 24 September 2013 at pages  9-12  of  the  bundle.   In
    addition, the bundle contains a number of supporting documents  dealing
    with the parties' financial position and also their health.

19. I deal first with the Immigration Rules.  The  appellant's  eligibility
    for limited leave to remain as a partner is found  in  Section  R-LTRP.
    By virtue of that provision, the appellant was  required  to  establish
    either that she satisfied the financial requirements in E-LTRP.3.1  or,
    if she could not, that she met the requirement in  para  EX.1  (see  R-
    LTRP.1.1(c) and (d)).

20. For a couple, E-LTRP.3.1 requires that:

         "The applicant must provide specified evidence,  from  the  sources
         listed in paragraph E-LTRP.3.2 of

         (a)  a specified gross annual income of at least

              (i) �18,600 ..."

21. By virtue of E-LTRP.3.2 the only relevant sources of income that may be
    taken into account are the "income of the partner from specified  self-
    employment" and "income of the applicant from specified employment".

22. Appendix FM-SE sets out the "specified evidence" which must be produced
    to establish the requirements of Appendix FM.  Paragraph A of  Appendix
    FM-SE states:

         "This Appendix sets out the specified evidence applicants  need  to
         provide to meet the requirements of the rules contained in Appendix
         FM...."

23.  Paragraph D of Appendix FM-SE states:

         "(a) In deciding an application in relation to which this  Appendix
         states  that  specified  documents  must  be  provided,  the  Entry
         Clearance Officer or Secretary of State ("the decision-maker") will
         consider documents that have been submitted with  the  application,
         and will only consider documents submitted  after  the  application
         where sub-paragraphs (b) or (e) applies."

24. Sub-paragraphs (b)-(d) and (f) then set out circumstances in which  the
    decision-maker may request further documents from an  applicant.   None
    are relevant here.  Sub-paragraph (e) allows for the non-application of
    the  requirement  to  provide   a   specified   document   in   certain
    circumstances.  That has no relevance here.

25. Appendix FM-SE deals with  proof  of  the  financial  requirements,  as
    relevant for this appeal, at paras A1 and 2.  Paragraph A1 states:

         "A1. To meet the financial requirements under  paragraphs  ....  E-
         LTRP.3.1 ..... of Appendix FM the applicant must meet:

         (a)   the  level  of  financial  requirement  applicable   to   the
             application under Appendix FM; and

         (b)  the requirement specified in Appendix FM and this Appendix  as
             to:

             (i)  The permitted sources of income and savings;
             (ii) The time periods and permitted  combinations  of  sources
                  applicable to each permitted source relied upon; and
             (iii)    The  evidence  required  for  each  permitted  source
                  relied upon."

26. So far as relevant to this appeal para 2 of Appendix FM-SE (as  at  the
    date of decision) states that:

         "2. In respect of salaried employment in the  UK,  ....all  of  the
         following evidence must be provided:

        a. Wage slips covering:

           i) a period of 6 months to the date of application if the person
              has been employed by their current employer for  at  least  6
              months...."

27. It is, of course, well-known that in R(MM)  v  SSHD  [2013]  EWHC  1900
    (Admin), Blake J held, in effect, that  the  financial  requirement  in
    Appendix FM could be a disproportionate interference  with  the  family
    life of a couple under Art 8 of the ECHR.  Blake J,  however,  did  not
    conclude that the  financial  requirements  in  Appendix  FM  were,  in
    themselves, unlawful.  Consequently, they remain in force.

28. In my judgment, it is clear that the effect of requiring an  individual
    to establish the financial requirements in E-LTRP.3.1 by reference  to,
    and only by reference to, the "specified evidence" set out in  Appendix
    FM-SE, the appellant could not,  and  cannot  now,  succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  That is because she was required  to  show  on  the
    basis of payslips covering a period of six months prior to the date  of
    application that she and her husband had a joint gross annual income of
    �18,600 (see SSHD v Raju and others [2013] EWCA Civ 754).

29. Further, s. 85(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002
    cannot assist the appellant.  That allows the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    consider:

         "...evidence about any matter  which  it  thinks  relevant  to  the
         substance of the decision,  including  evidence  which  concerns  a
         matter arising after the date of decision." (emphasis added)

30. The emphasised words have to be read in the context  of  what  precedes
    them, namely that it has to be evidence relevant to "the  substance  of
    the decision".  That, of course, is whether  the  appellant  meets  the
    financial requirements of Appendix FM on the basis  of  the  "specified
    evidence" which - and this is the crucial point - must relate to the  6
    month period prior to the application.  Financial evidence relevant  to
    any  later  period  cannot  assist  the  appellant  to  establish   the
    requirements of the Rules.

31. It was conceded by the appellant at the hearing that the  evidence  did
    not establish that she met the financial requirements for a period of 6
    months prior to her application.  At best, she could show that  at  the
    date of decision she had a joint income of �13,000 (see para 8  of  the
    judge's determination).  The Rules were simply not met by showing  that
    at the date of the hearing the appellant and her husband  had  a  gross
    annual income of at least �18,600 although, of course,  that  might  be
    relevant in assessing proportionality under Art 8.  Although, as I have
    indicated, in the course of his submissions Mr Ahmed drew my  attention
    to the wage slips and other  financial  documents  in  the  appellant's
    bundle, he did not resile from the concession made  at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing that this documentation could not (at the date of  the
    appellant's  application)  demonstrate  that  she  met  the   financial
    requirements of the Rules.

32. To that extent, therefore, the judge  erred  in  law  in  allowing  the
    appellant's appeal under the Rules.

33. However, even if the appellant could not succeed in showing she met the
    financial requirements, she could succeed (despite that) if  para  EX.1
    of Appendix FM applied.  So  far  as  relevant  para  EX.1  is  in  the
    following terms:

         "EX.1  This paragraph applies if ....

             (b)  the applicant has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship
                  with a partner who is in the UK and is a British  Citizen,
                  settled in  the  UK  ....  and  there  are  insurmountable
                  obstacles to family  life  with  that  partner  continuing
                  outside the UK."

34. In her decision letter, the  Secretary  of  State  concluded  that  the
    requirement to demonstrate  "insurmountable  obstacles"  had  not  been
    satisfied.

35. It does not appear that the appellant relied upon para EX.1 before  the
    judge.  The skeleton argument only deals,  insofar  as  the  Rules  are
    relied  upon,  with  the  financial  requirement  in  E-LTRP.3.1.    No
    reference is made to any argument that the appellant  was  entitled  to
    succeed under the Rules on the basis of para EX.1.  Judge  Baker  makes
    no reference to para EX.1 and that does not appear  to  have  been  the
    basis upon which she allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

36. In the light of that, the judge's decision to allow  the  appeal  under
    the Immigration Rules cannot stand.  It remains to be  decided  whether
    para EX.1 applies to the appellant.  As  I  have  indicated,  Mr  Ahmed
    submitted that it did.  I will deal with this issue in the  context  of
    Art 8 to which I now turn.

37. Having set out the appellant's financial circumstances at para  8,  the
    Judge dealt with Art 8 at paras 9-10 as follows:

         "9. I also note and again this was specifically not challenged, the
         Home Office Presenting Officer (sic) invited to state  whether  any
         challenges at all to the factual content in the  skeleton  argument
         in opening,  that  at  paragraph  16  it  is  identified  that  the
         appellant is pregnant with a child who will be a  British  national
         and as she has previously  suffered  a  miscarriage  she  would  be
         considered a high risk pregnancy were she required to leave the UK.

         10. Taking all these factors into account I  conclude  first  under
         the Immigration Rules and second under Article 8 of the  ECHR  that
         the appeal is to be allowed outright...."

38. I accept Mr Richards' submissions that the judge failed  adequately  to
    deal with the issue of proportionality.  The judge's reasons  given  in
    paras 9-10 of her determination were not, in my judgment,  adequate  to
    engage with the issues under Art 8.  Leaving aside that no findings are
    made on whether Art 8 is engaged, the  Judge  has  not  undertaken  the
    'balancing exercise' required  to  determine  whether  the  appellant's
    rights are outweighed by the public  interest.   I  set  that  decision
    aside and turn to remake it in the  light  of  the  Immigration  Rules,
    including the application of para EX.1.

39. The primary facts are not in dispute.  The appellant has been in the UK
    since 2009 as a student.  On 9 June 2012, she married the  sponsor,  Mr
    Barrett.  It has not been suggested that their  relationship  is  other
    than genuine and subsisting.  That is reinforced by the  evidence  that
    the appellant and her husband are seeking to  have  a  child  together.
    The appellant sadly lost her first baby on 1 June 2012 but is now  some
    six months pregnant.

40. The parties' financial position was not  called  into  question  by  Mr
    Richards.  The appellant works as a carer  for  Devon  County  Council.
    Since her course ended, she has worked full-time.  Mr Richards did  not
    challenge the  appellant's  evidence,  which  Mr  Ahmed  indicated  was
    supported by the documents in the bundle, that the appellant earns  now
    approximately �1,800 per month.  The appellant's husband now works  for
    a company called MITIE Ltd as a manager, earning �16,000 per annum.  He
    also works part-time for KFC, earning an additional  �1,000  per  year.
    Clearly, and it was not disputed  by  Mr  Richards,  the  gross  annual
    income of the parties now, but not  at  the  relevant  time  under  the
    Rules, meets the financial requirement in E-LTRP.3.1.  It,  of  course,
    exceeds by some way the lower level of gross annual  income  identified
    by Blake J in MM of �13,400.

41. The appellant and her  husband  currently  live  with  the  appellant's
    sister in her house in  which  they  have  exclusive  occupation  of  a
    bedroom.  They are trying to save to obtain a home of their own.

42. I accept that the appellant and her husband have established a  "family
    life" in the UK  together  and  a  private  life  not  least  with  her
    husband's family and friends.  Both also regularly  attend  a  Catholic
    church together.

43. As regards the parties' health, I accept that the sponsor suffers  from
    epilepsy and currently receives medication for his condition.  He  most
    recently suffered seizures on 30 December 2013 when he was admitted  to
    the accident and emergency department of a hospital in Exeter.   During
    that seizure, the sponsor bit his tongue  in  several  places,  leaving
    significant bruising.  That report  notes,  however,  that  the  likely
    trigger for his seizures was the fact that, as the sponsor informed the
    hospital, he had drunk a bottle of wine the previous day.  The  sponsor
    was advised to reduce his alcohol intake.

44. As regards the appellant, she suffers from "a partial, or mild form  of
    Turner Syndrome" (see letter dated 7 January 2013  from  Dr  C  Brewer,
    Consultant Clinical Geneticist).  The "main effect" on the appellant is
    that she is "shorter than most of [her] relatives".  Dr Brewer's letter
    clearly  indicates  that  there  is  a  risk  of  transmission  of  the
    chromosome abnormality described as Turner Syndrome to the  appellant's
    children.  Dr Brewer notes  that  "many  babies  with  Turner  Syndrome
    miscarry early on".  Dr Brewer notes that if the appellant has a  child
    who is a girl with Turner Syndrome then it is likely that she "will  do
    very well indeed, although she will probably  be  short  and  may  have
    fertility problems".

45. The starting point  must  be  the  Immigration  Rules  themselves  (see
    Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach)  [2013]  UKUT  00640
    (IAC) at [27] per Cranston J).

46. It is  accepted  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the  financial
    requirements of the Rule at the date of her application.  Likewise,  it
    is now not challenged that the parties' financial position has  changed
    such that in substance the appellant has  the  required  income  of  at
    least �18,600 gross annual income and, I did not understand  it  to  be
    challenged by Mr Richards,  this  was  demonstrated  by  the  necessary
    "specified evidence" if an application were made today.   In  short,  I
    did not understand it to be challenged that if an application were made
    today by the appellant she would meet the  requirements  of  the  Rule,
    even without reliance upon para EX.1.  That, however,  does  not  allow
    the appellant to succeed under the Immigration  Rules  in  this  appeal
    which has to be determined on the basis of the evidence at the date  of
    her application.

47. What, then, about the application of para  EX.1?   The  requirement  to
    demonstrate "insurmountable obstacles" was considered by the  Court  of
    Appeal in MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192.  There,  the  court
    concluded that, "insurmountable obstacles" should not be understood  in
    a literal sense as being obstacles which it is impossible  to  surmount
    (see [49] approving Izuazu (Article 8 - new  Rules)  [2013]  UKUT  0045
    (IAC) at [53]-[59]).  In Gulshan, the  Upper  Tribunal  summarised  the
    position as follows at [24(c)]:

         "The term 'insurmountable obstacles' in provisions such as  Section
         EX.1 are  not  obstacles  which  are  impossible  to  surmount:  MF
         (Nigeria); they concern the practical possibilities of relocation."

48. In Gulshan, the Upper Tribunal went on to say that:

         "In the absence of such insurmountable obstacles, if removal is  to
         be disproportionate, it is necessary to show other non-standard and
         particular   features   demonstrating   that   removal   will    be
         unjustifiably harsh:  Nagre."

49. I have carefully considered all the evidence to which I  was  referred.
    What, if any, are the "practical possibilities of  relocation"?   There
    is, of course, no impossibility in the appellant and her husband living
    in the Philippines.  There are, however, practical difficulties in them
    doing so.

50. At para 10 of her witness statement, the appellant says this:

         "I would not be able to move back to the Philippines:   my  husband
         Shey and I have fully established a life here in  the  UK.   If  he
         were to relocate to the Philippines with me he would not be able to
         communicate with anyone due to the language barrier thus inhibiting
         his ability to find employment there.  In addition, to  this  I  am
         afraid that Shey's condition may get worse if  we  were  forced  to
         relocate.  I have a good job here in the UK; I feel like I have the
         opportunity  to  help  people  in  their  lives.    It   would   be
         unreasonable for the SSHD to separate me and  my  husband;  we  are
         both currently working.  We can support ourselves here in the UK."

51. In his statement, the sponsor deals with these matters  as  follows  at
    para 7:

         "It would severely disrupt our life if [the appellant] had to leave
         the UK and go to the Philippines.  I do not know how  we  would  be
         able to carry on our lives together.  I have a stable job  here  in
         the UK and would not know if  I  would  be  able  to  work  in  the
         Philippines.  I do not know if  I  would  be  able  to  communicate
         there, let alone find employment.  It is  unreasonable  and  unjust
         that the Secretary of State would put us in such  a  position  that
         would jeopardise my relationship with my  wife.   I  know  that  my
         family would be upset if she were not allowed to remain in the  UK;
         they have accepted her as part of the  family.   Furthermore,  [the
         appellant's] family who are present and settled in the UK would  be
         upset as well.  I love [the appellant] and cannot  imagine  a  life
         without her."

52. In relation to the  parties'  health,  the  appellant  in  her  witness
    statement at para 7 says this:

         "I would first like to  point  out  that  Shey  is  a  sufferer  of
         epilepsy.  This condition seems to worsen during stressful periods;
         he had suffered seizures after the loss of our  child  and  he  has
         also suffered a seizure leading up to my hearing date.  I am afraid
         that if Shey were to be forced to move from the UK to  be  with  me
         his condition could worsen.  Furthermore, since  losing  our  first
         child I have discovered that I too have a condition  called  Turner
         Syndrome which makes it more difficult for  me  to  bear  children;
         although we want to have a child through natural means we have been
         told that I would need close monitoring throughout  the  pregnancy.
         I believe that moving from the UK could make our already  difficult
         position much harder.  I am currently two  months  pregnant  and  I
         would not want to risk the health of my unborn child."

53. Of course, at the date of the hearing, the appellant it is accepted  is
    six months pregnant.

54. It is also not challenged by Mr Richards that the appellant, as she had
    previously suffered a miscarriage, was to be considered  "a  high  risk
    pregnancy".

55. In her decision letter, the Secretary of State makes the bare assertion
    that:

         "You have not demonstrated any  insuperable  obstacles  that  would
         prevent you from continuing your family life outside the UK".

56. The  refusal  letter  provides  no  further  elucidation  of  why  that
    conclusion was reached.  Likewise, Mr Richards did not directly address
    me on this issue.  The matter is, in my judgment,  finely  balanced  in
    this appeal.  Although in reaching my conclusion I have considered  the
    appellant's circumstances cumulatively, it is her  health  and  current
    pregnancy which stands out as taking this case out of the 'run  of  the
    mill' cases.

57. The evidence of the appellant and  her  husband  as  to  the  practical
    difficulties he may face in seeking employment in  the  Philippines  is
    not challenged.   He  suffers  from  epilepsy  and  currently  receives
    medication.  The problems with his health are, nevertheless,  a  factor
    to be considered where it is suggested that a British citizen  who  has
    lived his entire life in the UK is asked to live abroad.

58. As regards the appellant's health, the evidence does not  suggest  that
    as  a  person  with  Turner  Syndrome  she  suffers  from  any   health
    disadvantage apart from problems of fertility and risk of  miscarriage.
    The appellant  is  currently  six  months  pregnant.   She  suffered  a
    miscarriage previously in June 2012.  Mr Richards did not challenge the
    characterisation  of  the  appellant's  pregnancy  as  a   "high   risk
    pregnancy".  That, in my judgment, follows from the evidence concerning
    the heightened risk of miscarriage where a mother has Turner Syndrome.

59. Nothing in para EX.1 requires the "insurmountable obstacles"  to  exist
    permanently so as to prevent the parties carrying on their family  life
    abroad.  Here, in my judgment, the appellant's pregnancy creates a real
    and  significant  practical  difficulty  to  her   returning   to   the
    Philippines at least for the duration of her pregnancy and  equates  to
    "insurmountable obstacles".

60. Even if I am wrong about  that,  those  circumstances  are  "compelling
    circumstances"  such  that  removal  would  be  "unjustifiably   harsh"
    sufficient, when taken together  with  all  the  circumstances  of  the
    appellant and the sponsor, to outweigh the public interest in effective
    immigration control.  In reaching that conclusion, I take into  account
    what is accepted before me  that  the  appellant  meets  the  financial
    requirement of the Rules at the date of the hearing.  The appellant has
    always been in the UK lawfully.

61. It has to be asked:  what purpose is served by requiring the  appellant
    either to make a new application either in country or by  returning  to
    the Philippines?  In my judgment, no purpose whatsoever  is  served  by
    imposing such a procedural requirement.

62. I accept that the appellant has established private and family life  in
    the UK and that if  returned  to  the  Philippines  there  will  be  an
    interference with that private and family life so as to engage Art 8.1.
     Any such interference would be in accordance with the law  and  for  a
    legitimate aim.  However, having regard to all  the  circumstances  and
    for the reasons I have set out above, the public interest in  effective
    immigration control is outweighed by the appellant's right  to  respect
    for her private and family life.

63. For these reasons, the appellant has established  that  she  meets  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules, applying para EX.1  of  Appendix
    FM.

64. Further, the appellant's removal would breach Art 8 of the ECHR.

Decision

65. For these reasons, the First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  to  allow  the
    appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules and Art 8  involved  the
    making of an error of law.  Those decisions are set aside.

66. I remake the  decisions  allowing  the  appellant's  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules and Art 8 of the ECHR.
