                                   Between

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                                     pS
                         (ANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE)
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss K Smith, instructed by Braitch RB, Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to the Respondent as the Appellant and to  the  Appellant
    as the Respondent (as they appeared respectively before the  First-tier
    Tribunal).

 2. The Appellant was born in India on 20 March  1978  and  applied  for  a
    residence card based on his relationship with  a  citizen  of  Romania.
    His application was refused on 15 September  2014  by  the  Respondent.
    The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Robson) which,
    in a determination promulgated on 31 December 2014, allowed the appeal.

 3. It is common ground between the parties that the judge should not  have
    allowed the appeal outright.  It is  for  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    exercise a discretion as to whether to issue a  residence  card  to  an
    extended family member under the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006
    (see Ihemedu (OFMs - meaning) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00340).  I  therefore
    set aside the judge's determination and  have  substituted  a  decision
    allowing the appeal but only to the extent that the matter is  returned
    to the Secretary of State to consider whether to issue a residence card
    to the Appellant.

Notice of Decision

 4. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal which was  promulgated  on
    31 December 2014 is set aside.  I remake the decision.  The Appellant's
    appeal is allowed to the limited extent that the matter is remitted  to
    the Secretary of State for her to consider whether to issue a residence
    card to the Appellant.
