For the Appellant:     Mr Bates Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Adewusi, Crown and Law Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. The Respondent is a national of Nigeria born in  1975.  On  the  11th
       March 2020 his appeal was allowed by the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
       Chowdhury). On the 6th April 2020 the Secretary of State was  granted
       permission to appeal to this Tribunal against that decision.




       Anonymity Order

    2. The Respondent is a foreign criminal and as such would not ordinarily
       benefit from an order for anonymity. This appeal does however concern
       his children in the United Kingdom. I am concerned  that  identifying
       the Respondent could lead to the identification of those children and
       that this would be contrary to their  best  interests.    Having  had
       regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
       2008 and the Presidential Guidance  Note  No  1  of  2013:  Anonymity
       Orders I therefore consider it appropriate to make an  order  in  the
       following terms:

           "Unless and until a tribunal or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
           Appellant is granted anonymity.  No report of these  proceedings
           shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member  of  his
           family.  This direction applies to,  amongst  others,  both  the
           Appellant and the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
           direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




       Background and Issues Before the First-tier Tribunal

    3. The Respondent is an illegal entrant who  has  never  held  leave  to
       remain.  He has been in the United Kingdom since  the  19th  February
       2000. He obtained entry using a Dutch passport to which  he  was  not
       entitled and remained here using that document  for  some  years.  In
       2009 he contracted  what  was  later  found  to  be  a  'marriage  of
       convenience' to a Dutch national with a view to obtaining  permission
       to reside under the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations
       2016 as her family member.  On the 4th January 2013 he was  convicted
       on two counts of deception in  respect  of  that  behaviour.  He  was
       eventually sentenced to serve  58  weeks  in  prison,  that  sentence
       triggering the 'automatic deportation' provisions in s32 Borders  Act
       2007.

    4. The  Respondent  resisted  deportation  on  two  grounds.  First,  he
       submitted that his deportation would have an unduly harsh  impact  on
       his qualifying children in the United Kingdom.  Further  and  in  the
       alternative, he submitted that there  are  in  his  case  exceptional
       circumstances why his deportation today would be  a  disproportionate
       interference with his Article 8 rights.

    5. The First-tier Tribunal found that the appeal succeeded on the  first
       ground. It accepted the evidence that the Respondent  enjoys  a  very
       close relationship with his two daughters (hereinafter identified  as
       D1 and D2) and that he is in fact  their  main  carer.  The  Tribunal
       placed weight on a comment by a social worker, made in a letter dated
       27th September 2019, that she was worried about the mother's  ability
       to "cope" looking after the children.  The social worker opined  that
       there would be a significant impact  upon  the  children's  emotional
       well-being if the Respondent were to  be  deported.  An  incident  of
       physical chastisement was noted when the Respondent had  been  absent
       from the family home.  These factors,  considered  cumulatively,  led
       the Tribunal to conclude that  it  would  be  unduly  harsh  for  the
       children if their father were to be removed.

    6. Having made that finding the Tribunal did not go on to  consider  the
       alternative limb of the Respondent's case.




       Error of Law: Discussion and Findings

    7. Having heard the submissions of both parties I am satisfied that  the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal is flawed for error  of  law  and
       that it must be set aside in its entirety.

    8. The first error is a failure  to  take  all  material  evidence  into
       account. In its very brief reasoning  between  paragraphs  54-59  the
       Tribunal nowhere considers the  opinion  expressed  by  a  number  of
       professionals dealing with this family that, contrary to the  picture
       that emerges from the  Tribunal  decision,  it  is  the  Respondent's
       behaviour in the family  home  that  is  damaging  to  his  children.
       Concerns are expressed in particular about the behaviours that he has
       exhibited in front of his daughters  including  threatening  to  kill
       himself, and them. Such concerns are expressed by  a  number  of  the
       professionals dealing with this family.  This  is  behaviour  plainly
       contrary to his children's best  interests  and  yet  nowhere  is  it
       considered in the balancing exercise.  Instead the  decision  focuses
       exclusively on a brief comment to the effect that on one occasion the
       children's mother may have physically chastised one of them.  As such
       the decision does not reflect a balanced evaluation of the evidence.

    9. The second error is the failure to articulate why,  on  the  evidence
       presented, the impact for these children could be said to  be  bleak.
       No consideration appears to have been given to the  fact  that  their
       mother  coped  without  the  Respondent  during  the  period  of  his
       incarceration.  This was plainly a  relevant  consideration:  instead
       the social worker's opinion that she "may" find it difficult  without
       him has been interpreted as meaning  that  she  would  be  unable  to
       parent in his absence. That does not appear to be a finding justified
       on the evidence.

   10. I therefore set the decision of the First-tier Tribunal aside.




       Directions

       Mental Health

   11. The bundles before me contain numerous references to  the  Respondent
       having been  diagnosed  with  conditions  including  severe  anxiety,
       depression and PTSD. These references notwithstanding it  is  not  at
       all clear when these diagnoses have been made and by whom.  Nor is it
       clear whether any investigation has taken place into the Respondent's
       self-reported auditory hallucinations, nor what  treatment  he  might
       currently be receiving.  If the Respondent  wishes  to  rely  on  his
       mental health as a relevant factor in this appeal he is  directed  to
       file and serve an up-to-date medical  report  setting  out  in  clear
       terms what his diagnosis is,  and  what  treatment,  if  any,  he  is
       receiving. If the Respondent wishes to obtain medical opinion on  the
       likely impact upon his mental health of deportation, that is a matter
       for him.  Any new medical evidence must be filed and served within  8
       weeks of the sending of this decision.

       Children

   12. When Judge Holt heard the Respondent's appeal on protection and human
       rights grounds in July 2016 she was told that he  had  two  daughters
       and that he was no longer in a  subsisting  relationship  with  their
       mother. Although that  lady  is  described  throughout  Judge  Holt's
       decision as the Respondent's ex-wife, it is clear that they  were  in
       fact co-habiting at the date of that appeal.

   13. In 2018 the Respondent made further submissions  and  asked  for  his
       deportation order to be revoked. In their letter  of  6th  June  2018
       Crown & Law Solicitors refer to D1 and D2  and  enclose  their  birth
       certificates, praying in aid  their  best  interests.  Included  with
       those  'fresh  claim'  submissions  was  however  a  good   deal   of
       professional evidence relating to the Respondent's mental health  and
       the  children.  Included  in  the  documentation  was   an   'Initial
       Assessment Tool' used by the Greater Manchester Mental  Health  team.
       This records that the  Respondent  told  the  person  conducting  the
       assessment on the 19th April 2018 (identified only  as  "Vikki  May")
       that he had been in a relationship with his Nigerian  partner  for  8
       years and that they  have  four  children  together.    This  curious
       discrepancy caused the Secretary of State to  seek  clarification  on
       how many children the Respondent had. The Secretary of State  appears
       to have sought information from Manchester Children's Services on the
       matter because on the 18th March 2019 she wrote  to  the  Respondent,
       explaining that Children's Services had disclosed that he does indeed
       have four children and asking him to explain.

   14. As of the date  of  the  appeal  before  me  it  is  clear  that  the
       Respondent has at least three children in the United Kingdom. D1 born
       in 2010 (who has recently been naturalised as a British  citizen)  D2
       born in 2012, and a son born in 2017 (hereinafter referred to as S1).
       I am told that he also has a stepdaughter born in  2014  (hereinafter
       referred to as SD1 - recognised as  a  British  national  by  birth).
       What is not clear is  why  neither  his  son  nor  stepdaughter  were
       referred to in the 'fresh claim'  letter sent by Crown & Law  on  the
       6th June 2018 nor indeed the Respondent's witness  statement  of  the
       16th November 2019 where [at �5] he makes express reference to D1 and
       D2. The Respondent is to file and serve  a  clear  witness  statement
       explaining why he did not mention SD1 or S1 in either his fresh claim
       submissions to the Secretary  of  State,  or  his  witness  statement
       prepared  for  the  appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.    The
       Respondent may also wish to address the apparent discrepancy  in  the
       evidence that he told his  mental  health  worker  that  he  and  his
       partner had been together for 8 years and what I am now  told,  which
       is that in fact they had for a period been separated, giving rise  to
       the birth in 2014 of SD1.  This witness statement must be  filed  and
       served within 4 weeks of this decision being sent to the parties.

   15. In light of the discrepant evidence outlined above the  Secretary  of
       State may wish to consider whether she is content to proceed  on  the
       basis that the father of SD1 is, as claimed, a British  national  and
       not in fact the Respondent.  If the Secretary of State wishes to make
       any submissions on this point, or adduce any  further  evidence,  she
       must do so within 4 weeks of this decision being sent, so as  to  put
       the Respondent on notice of any issues arising.




       Decisions

   16. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains material  error
       of law and it is set aside.

   17. The decision in the appeal is to be remade de novo in the  First-tier
       Tribunal by any judge other than Judge Chowdhury.

   18. There is an order for anonymity.
