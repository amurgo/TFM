Representation
For the Appellant:     Ms Kareena Maciel, instructed by Alexander
                       Solicitors & Advocates
For the Respondent:          Mr Peter Deller, Home Office Presenting
Officer

In view of the influence  that  a  decision  under  para  320  may  have  on
subsequent applications by an appellant, it is desirable that  the  Tribunal
should give its view on issues arising under that  paragraph  even  if  they
are not  material  to  the  determination,  provided  that  there  has  been
sufficient evidence to enable it to do so.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan.  He appealed to  the  Tribunal
    against the decision of the respondent on 25 October 2007 refusing  him
    entry clearance to the United Kingdom as the  spouse  of  the  sponsor.
    The Immigration Judge dismissed his appeal.  The appellant  sought  and
    obtained an order for reconsideration.  Thus the  matter  comes  before
    us.

 2. It is  right  to  say  that  the  history  of  this  case  is  somewhat
    unedifying.  The appellant made his  application  on  the  basis  of  a
    marriage, but it is accepted on his behalf that the  appellant  is  not
    married to the sponsor.  The position is that they have been through  a
    religious ceremony in this country and regard  themselves  as  married;
    but they are not married in English Law because the requirements of the
    Marriage Acts  have  not  been  complied  with.   The  application  was
    nevertheless, as we say, made on that basis.  It was refused partly  on
    the basis of paragraph 320 of the Immigration Rules.

 3. When the matter came before  the  Immigration  Judge,  the  Immigration
    Judge indicated to Ms Maciel, who represented the appellant before  him
    as she does before us, that she had no need to deal with paragraph 320:
    but the Immigration Judge then, having indicated (we are told) that  he
    rarely upheld decisions based on paragraph 320, mentioned it not at all
    in his decision.  The Immigration  Judge  that  added  further  errors,
    firstly and most remarkably by concluding, on what basis we  know  not,
    that the sponsor was in the United Kingdom not as settled but merely as
    a work permit holder; and secondly by failing to  take  account  of  or
    perhaps misunderstanding some of the evidence said to support the human
    rights arguments.

 4. We are satisfied that the Immigration Judge made a number of errors  of
    law.  The most important of those is no doubt  the  error  in  thinking
    that the sponsor was not settled in the United  Kingdom.   There  is  a
    further error perhaps in that, having  made  that  error,  he  did  not
    follow it up by concluding that the application could  not  succeed  on
    the basis it was made - that of a person married to someone present and
    settled in the United Kingdom; but that is  another  matter.   He  gave
    lamentably little attention to the  complex  and  cumulative  arguments
    made on human rights grounds, both on the  basis  of  the  position  of
    members of the appellant's family, if we may call them  that,  in  this
    country and on the circumstances that they would meet if they  were  in
    Pakistan with him.

 5. In our view he also erred in failing to give a view on  paragraph  320.
    It is right to say, as Mr Deller has said, that in the circumstances of
    his determination, as he was dismissing the appeal in  any  event,  the
    considerations relating paragraph  320  could  not  have  affected  the
    outcome of the appeal.  Any error on that point would therefore not  be
    material to the outcome of the appeal, and in the circumstances of this
    case failure to deal with paragraph 320 could not of itself justify  an
    order for reconsideration.  Nevertheless, it appears to  us  that  when
    matters going to paragraph 320 have been the subject of submissions  at
    a hearing, it  is  highly  desirable  (but  not,  we  would  emphasise,
    essential, unless of course the outcome of the appeal depends  on  this
    point) for an Immigration Judge to give his views on the  applicability
    of that paragraph, if he can readily do so on the basis of the material
    before him.  This is particularly so now when, following amendments  to
    paragraph 320 since the decision in this case, an individual's previous
    immigration  history  may  be  of   very   considerable   and   perhaps
    determinative importance in  any  future  application  by  him.   Where
    paragraph 320, or matters going to paragraph 320, are dealt with  at  a
    hearing an Immigration Judge should if possible  give  a  view  in  his
    determination on the issue.  We say that because we are aware that,  if
    there has been a refusal based on paragraph 320, and that aspect of the
    refusal  has  not  been  specifically  dealt  with  or  reversed  in  a
    determination, an Entry Clearance Officer, who may have made a  mistake
    of fact or of law in relying on it first time, will feel reinforced  in
    his view on a second application.

 6. The position in this appeal is that  the  sponsor  is  settled  in  the
    United Kingdom.  She was settled at the date of the decision and we are
    told that she has now British citizenship.   The  appellant  is  not  a
    person who, as the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  thought,  entered  as  a
    visitor in 1992 and overstayed.  He came seeking asylum in  1999.   His
    asylum claim was unsuccessful but he was entitled to work  as  he  did.
    Nothing in the matters mentioned by the Entry Clearance  Officer  gives
    any reason for the Entry Clearance Officer to  refuse  under  paragraph
    320 and paragraph 320  should  not  have  appeared  in  the  notice  of
    decision.

 7. There remains however the difficulty that the application was made  for
    Entry Clearance as a spouse and the appellant is not a spouse.  It  was
    suggested to the Immigration Judge, and it was suggested again  to  us,
    that on appeal the matter should be looked at as though the application
    had been made  as  a  fianc�.   The  problem  with  that  is  that  the
    application was not made as a fianc� and, looking at the  circumstances
    of that application and decision today in  respect  of  a  fianc�,  the
    appeal would be bound to fail because there is no  suggestion  that  at
    the date of the decision the appellant intended to marry the sponsor or
    she him.  They both say, or at any rate said, that they were married.

 8. There are numerous  human  rights  arguments  made  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant, of the sponsor and of their child.  We do not think that  Ms
    Maciel would say that any of them  is  sufficient  alone  to  cause  an
    appeal of this sort to succeed.  She relies on them  cumulatively:  but
    even taken at their best and cumulatively they would fail  unless  they
    had the effect that the (not very unusual) circumstances of this family
    entitled them completely to  ignore  immigration  law  and  procedures.
    What Ms Maciel would have to say if she pressed her arguments is  that,
    although the appellant did not make the appropriate application, he  is
    entitled to entry clearance on appeal.  That, as she appreciates, is  a
    difficult argument: and it is fair to say that without withdrawing  any
    of the considerations which went towards it  she  has  not  pressed  it
    before us.  We reject it.

 9. The position is that the appellant can and no doubt soon will  make  an
    application for entry clearance  as  a  fianc�,  recognising  that  the
    religious ceremony that he has gone through is not  effective  to  make
    him the sponsor's husband in English  law,  but  that  he  can  readily
    remedy that by  a  civil  ceremony.   He  will  say  no  doubt  in  the
    application that he meets  all  the  requirements  of  the  immigration
    rules.  He will rely on this determination to  demonstrate  that  there
    was  nothing  in  the  present  application  that  should  have  caused
    paragraph 320 to be invoked.

10. For the reasons we have given, having found that the Immigration  Judge
    erred in law, we substitute a determination dismissing the  appellant's
    appeal.
