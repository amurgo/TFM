Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is the appeal of the Secretary of State but I will  refer  to  the
    original appellant, a citizen of Bangladesh born on 30  December  1980,
    as the appellant herein.

2.   On 5 November  2015  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  to  grant  the
    appellant leave to remain under paragraph 245DD of HC 395.  The  reason
    for the decision was in essence that the appellant had  used  deception
    to obtain an Educational Testing Services (ETS)  Test  of  English  for
    International Communication (TOEIC)  certificate.   The  appellant  had
    undertaken a test at Synergy Business College  of  London  on  17  July
    2012.  Following a check by ETS it was the Secretary  of  State's  case
    that there was "significant evidence to conclude that your  certificate
    was fraudulently obtained by the use  of  a  proxy  test  taker".   The
    appellant's test had been declared to be  invalid.   The  Secretary  of
    State  was  satisfied  that  the  appellant's  certificate   had   been
    fraudulently obtained.

3.   The appellant appealed against the decision and his appeal came  before
    a First-tier Judge on 7 February 2017.  The judge heard  oral  evidence
    from the appellant.  The judge reached his conclusions as follows:

         "12. In his evidence before me the appellant stated  that  the  ETS
             test about which the respondent complains was not obtained  by
             deception.  In support of his assertion the appellant he (sic)
             pointed to his achievement in obtaining a diploma in  business
             administration for the academic season 2008-2009  and  an  MBA
             from the Thames Valley University on  the  10th  August  2010.
             Both  courses  were  taught  and  assessed  in  English.   His
             argument is that the standard achieved in 2012  is  consistent
             with the abilities revealed by those earlier qualifications.


         13.  Having heard the appellant  and  considered  the  evidence  he
             cites in support  of  his  case  I  am  satisfied  as  to  his
             credibility.


         14.  The respondent's finding is expressed thus, 'ETS has a  record
             of your speaking test.  Using voice verification software, ETS
             is able to detect when a single person is undertaking multiple
             tests.  ETS undertook a check of your test  and  confirmed  to
             the SSHD that there was significant evidence to conclude  that
             your certificate was fraudulently obtained by  the  use  of  a
             proxy tester.  ETS have declared your test to be 'Invalid' due
             to the aforementioned presence of a proxy tester who  sat  the
             test in  your  place,  and  the  scores  have  therefore  been
             cancelled by ETS.'


         15.  It was put to the  appellant  that  he  was  involved  in  the
             fraudulent obtaining of his ETS  in  2012.   To  further  this
             suggestion the respondent had served on the Tribunal  and  the
             appellant a bundle of documents including  generic  statements
             from Rebecca Collins and Peter  Millington,  both  dated  23rd
             June 2014, the Home Office report on Synergy Business College,
             London and Professor Peter French's report, dated  20th  April
             2016.  None of the evidence provided  attached  explicitly  to
             the test undertaken by the appellant.


         16.  This issue has been considered  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
             Sharif Ahmed Majumar (sic) and Ihsan Qadir v. SSHD [2016] EWCA
             Civ 1167.  In that decision Beatson LJ considered the adequacy
             of the material then submitted by the respondent to  discharge
             the  legal  burden  of  proof  on  her  of  proving  that  the
             certificates were produced by dishonesty.   When  the  appeals
             were heard the  evidence  relied  upon  was  that  of  Rebecca
             Collins and  Peter  Millington.   The  finding  of  the  Court
             (relevant to this appeal) was that the evidence  submitted  by
             the  respondent  was  capable  of  discharging   the   initial
             evidential burden, but when challenged by the  appellant  with
             other  evidence  sufficient  to  shift  the  burden   to   the
             respondent, it did not discharge the legal burden  of  proving
             on the balance of probabilities on her  of  proving  that  the
             certificates were produced by dishonesty.


         17.  Here the appellant states that it was  he  who  undertook  the
             test at Synergy Business College on the  17th  July  2012  and
             that the "invalid" conclusion reached  is  one  of  the  small
             number of "false positives" spoken of by Professor French.  In
             support of his  contention  he  cites  the  qualifications  he
             obtained in the UK in the years before [he] sat  this  English
             test and his own testimony as to the  precise  nature  of  the
             test, the number and nature of the questions asked.


         18.   The  evidence  adduced  by  the  respondent  allows  for  the
             possibility of false positives.  The appellant has attained  a
             qualification taught in English in a technical subject, namely
             business administration, to degree level in  2010,  before  he
             undertook the ETS test.  When considering the totality of  the
             evidence I am  not  satisfied  the  evidence  adduced  by  the
             respondent has discharged the legal burden upon her.


         19.  Having considered all the material submitted by the respondent
             in support of  her  assertion  I  am  not  satisfied  she  has
             discharged the legal burden upon her.


         20.  Not being satisfied  the  leave  spoken  of  was  obtained  by
             deception, and having found the appellant credible, that being
             the only basis upon which the  appellant  was  found  to  have
             failed to  satisfy  paragraph  245DD  I  am  satisfied  he  is
             entitled to the 10 points he sought under Appendix  B  English
             Language."

4.   The  judge  was  accordingly  satisfied  that  the  appellant  met  the
    relevant requirements of the Rules and allowed the appeal.

5.   The Secretary of State applied for permission to  appeal  arguing  that
    the First-tier Judge had failed to give an adequate explanation  as  to
    how the appellant had raised an innocent explanation  given  the  small
    number of false positives that had been identified by Professor French.
     The judge had relied on the appellant's English language  ability  and
    the Secretary of State referred to paragraph 57 of MA (Nigeria)  [2016]
    UKUT 450 where the Tribunal had referred to  a  range  of  reasons  why
    persons proficient in English might engage in fraud, such as  "lack  of
    confidence, fear of failure, lack of time and commitment  and  contempt
    for the immigration system".

6.   The judge had failed to give adequate reasons  for  concluding  that  a
    person who clearly spoke English would have no reason to secure a  test
    certificate by deception and the Secretary of State had discharged  the
    evidential burden upon her and it was for the  appellant  to  offer  an
    innocent explanation.  It was clear from the decision that  the  First-
    tier Judge had not appreciated that the evidential burden had been met.
     While it was accepted that the verification system was not  infallible
    it was adequately  robust  and  rigorous.   Permission  to  appeal  was
    granted by the First-tier Tribunal on the  basis  that  the  judge  had
    failed to provide adequate or sufficient reasoning  for  accepting  the
    appellant's version of events.

7.   A response was filed by the appellant's representatives on  16  October
    2017 submitting that the judge had considered the matter  appropriately
    following the decision of the Court of Appeal in Majumder  referred  to
    by the judge in paragraph 16 of his decision.

8.   Mr Bates relied on  the  grounds  of  appeal.   The  decision  was  not
    adequately reasoned.  The judge had referred  to  the  material  relied
    upon by the Secretary of State in paragraph 15 of his decision.   Among
    that material was the  report  on  Synergy  Business  College  entitled
    "Project Faï¿½ade - Criminal Inquiry into  Abuse  of  the  TOEIC".   This
    report covered the relevant period when the  appellant  had  undertaken
    the test.  It was not simply  generic  evidence.   Imposters  had  been
    observed taking the test on behalf of candidates who were located in  a
    separate  room.   There  was  evidence  of  widespread  cheating.    He
    submitted that the 2% figure was a generous estimate.  In  98%  of  the
    cases ETS was (as he put it) "bang on the money".   The  fact  that  an
    appellant had no need to cheat was not  enough  -  he  referred  to  MA
    (Nigeria) as set out in  the  grounds  of  appeal.   The  decision  was
    materially flawed in law and should be remitted for a fresh hearing.

9.    Counsel  submitted  that  he  struggled  to  see  any  errors  in  the
    determination.  The grounds were no more than a disagreement  with  the
    decision.  The judge had found the appellant to be credible and he  had
    given oral evidence and had been cross-examined.

10.  The appellant had not simply undertaken  English  language  courses  at
    random colleges but had an MBA from  Thames  Valley  University,  apart
    from the Diploma in Business Administration and both courses  had  been
    taught and assessed in English.  The judge had heard oral evidence  and
    had been satisfied with the appellant's credibility.  It is quite clear
    that the judge was aware of the shifting burden and he had been  guided
    by relevant authority.  The decision was  reasoned.   In  reaching  his
    conclusions the  judge  had  had  the  benefit  of  a  lengthy  witness
    statement and in paragraph 17 of the decision he had  referred  to  the
    appellant's testimony as to the precise nature of the test, the  number
    and nature of the questions asked.  These were set out in  the  witness
    statement.  In that statement the appellant had referred to the reasons
    why he had chosen Synergy Business College and had given details of his
    journey to the test centre.  The material relied on by the Secretary of
    State had been handed in to the First-tier Judge  on  the  day  of  the
    hearing.  The judge had had regard to the Project Faï¿½ade  report  which
    was dated 15 May 2015.  Counsel submitted it was out of date and  there
    was no evidence of any prosecution.  The burden on  the  appellant  was
    not a heavy one and he had given a detailed account and had been cross-
    examined.  Counsel drew a distinction between the  ETS  cases  and  the
    Cambridge College of Learning cases where there had been no courses run
    at all.

11.  The judge had conducted a holistic  assessment  having  considered  all
    the material before him and was not satisfied that the legal burden had
    been discharged.  What had been said at paragraph 57  of  MA  (Nigeria)
    was obiter and expressed as an hypothesis.  The appellant had a  degree
    at university and the judge had not taken into  account  an  irrelevant
    matter when considering English language ability.

12.  Counsel submitted that the position in the  instant  appeal  fell  into
    the second category of case identified in paragraph 30 of Majumder -

     "The second category of case is one in which the Secretary of State  is
         the appellant and the  Tribunal  correctly  decides  that  she  had
         discharged the initial evidential burden with her generic  evidence
         but in the light of other evidence had  not  discharged  the  legal
         burden. This category is broadly the  scenario  in  the  two  cases
         before us. Mr Kovats stated  that  the  Secretary  of  State  would
         review those cases and, without giving an answer in  respect  of  a
         particular case for understandable reasons, also  stated  that  she
         would be minded to concede the appeal. He thus  indicated  what  he
         described as a broad departure of travel."

13.  In  reply  Mr  Bates  accepted  that  he  had  no  up-to-date  evidence
    following the Faï¿½ade report.  The material before  the  judge  included
    the ETS look-up tool.  The judge was required to weigh up the  evidence
    and balance it against the material in the Project Faï¿½ade report.   The
    fact that the appellant knew how to get to the test centre and so forth
    had to be seen in the context that proxy test takers  as  well  as  the
    individual candidate were both observed in the building. The report was
    more than a generic report and the judge was required to  consider  it.
    Reliance was placed on paragraph 57 of MA (Nigeria).  It  was  accepted
    that the judge had referred to the report.

14.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I  remind
    myself that I cannot interfere with  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Judge unless it was flawed in law.

15.  Prior to the hearing before the First-tier Judge the  usual  directions
    had been issued giving notice of the hearing on 7  February  2017.   In
    compliance with those directions the  appellant's  representatives  had
    filed an indexed and paginated bundle of documents before  the  hearing
    including a seven page witness  statement  from  the  appellant  giving
    specific details of the test he had undertaken and why he had taken it.
     He gives details of his travels and what happened  at  reception.   He
    gave full details of the various tests.  I should mention that  Counsel
    submitted that the length  of  the  tests  appear  to  conform  to  the
    material contained in a user guide which Counsel had  culled  from  the
    internet.  I do not place much reliance on this particular point as the
    evidence was not, I understand, before the First-tier Judge.

16.  It appears that while the appellant had lodged material in  advance  as
    required by the directions the respondent simply lodged material at the
    hearing.  No objection was taken by the appellant and it is clear in my
    view that  the  judge  had  full  regard  to  the  material  submitted,
    apparently at a very late stage.

17.  As Counsel submitted the judge made a positive credibility  finding  in
    respect of the appellant who had given oral evidence and had been cross-
    examined.

18.  It is true that the judge took into account in  reaching  his  decision
    the appellant's  English  language  ability,  but  I  accept  Counsel's
    submission that this was not a misdirection.  English language  ability
    is not an irrelevant matter and the judge had regard to it as  part  of
    his assessment, which he was entitled to do.   The  judge  records  the
    argument advanced was that the standard achieved in the  disputed  test
    was  consistent  with   the   abilities   revealed   by   the   earlier
    qualifications.

19.  It is accepted by Mr Bates that the judge did  refer  to  the  material
    lodged by the  respondent  including  the  Project  Faï¿½ade  report.  As
    counsel observes there was no updating material  in  relation  to  this
    report. I see nothing  in  the  argument  that  the  judge  misdirected
    himself on the burden and standard of proof - he sets out the  learning
    in paragraph 16 of his decision.  There is no  indication  he  did  not
    apply that correct burden.  It was open to the judge to find  that  the
    appellant had met the initial evidential  burden  for  the  reasons  he
    gives.  As I have said, he did  not  simply  rely  on  the  appellant's
    qualification but  all  the  material  put  forward  by  the  appellant
    including his detailed evidence both in his witness statement  and  his
    oral evidence to which the judge refers in  paragraph  17.   The  judge
    states, and I have no reason to doubt that he considered  the  totality
    of the evidence when reaching his conclusion.

20.  While  the  decision  is  not  a  lengthy  one  it  covers  the  ground
    satisfactorily and is not inadequately reasoned as claimed.   I  remind
    myself that the judge had the benefit of hearing oral evidence and came
    to a positive view of that evidence.

21.  Despite Mr Bates's well-argued submissions I am not satisfied that  the
    decision is materially flawed in law, and  accordingly  I  dismiss  the
    Secretary of State's challenge and direct  that  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Judge shall stand.

22.  Appeal dismissed.

23.  The First-tier Judge made no anonymity order and I make none.


TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The First-tier Judge made no fee award for reasons he explains  and  I  make
none.
