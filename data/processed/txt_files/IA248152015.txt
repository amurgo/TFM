                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant is a national of Russia, born in 1982.  She  entered  the
    United Kingdom on 20 October 2008 with leave to remain  as  a  student.
    Her leave to remain was extended, initially as a student and then under
    Tier 1 Post Study provisions until 21st of March 2014. On 23 July 2011,
    the appellant had undergone a religious marriage to a  Bengali  citizen
    Mohammed Arif Imran Khan, who had been here since  29  September  2014,
    and whom she had met when they were both on an MBA  course  at  Cardiff
    University, and she has worked for Marriot Hotels  Ltd  since  2011  in
    various locations and different positions, and  her  husband  has  been
    working to qualify as a chartered management  accountant  with,  on  16
    October 2016, only one paper left to complete. On 3rd of March 2014 the
    appellant was included as a  dependent  on  her  husband's  family  and
    private life application. On 22nd of  June  2015  the  application  was
    refused on the basis that as at the date of application the appellant's
    husband had not obtained the necessary 10 years lawful  residence.  The
    appellant's husband appealed the decision to the  First-tier  tribunal,
    and in the course of those proceedings, and at the repeated request  of
    the appellant, the respondent  agreed  to  withdraw  the  decision  and
    reconsider the appellant's husband's application given that he  had  in
    the interim achieved further lawful residence. On 22nd of June 2015 the
    husband was granted leave to remain on the basis of having achieved  10
    years lawful residence, limited 2 years in the  1st  instance  with  an
    invitation to reapply with evidence of having achieved the Knowledge of
    Life and English-language requirements.

 2. On 22nd of June 2015 the  respondent  at  the  same  time  refused  the
    appellant's application on the basis that there was  no  provision  for
    the dependents of applicants who are successful  in  obtaining  limited
    leave to remain on the basis of long residence to be granted  leave  to
    remain in line. The appellant's  application  was  accordingly  refused
    under the immigration rules, the respondent considered  the  article  8
    position but  found  it  proportionate  that  she  should  be  removed,
    concluding in essence that it was open to the  appellant's  husband  to
    accompany her, or if he chose to remain, to maintain their relationship
    from the United Kingdom, or  support  an  application  to  return  from
    Russia. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. In July 2016, the appellant's husband  went  in  person  to  apply  for
    indefinite leave to remain and  he  was  granted  indefinite  leave  to
    remain on the same date.

 4. The appellant's appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  heard  on  30
    December 2016 and Judge Malcolm dismissed  her  appeal.  Judge  Malcolm
    recorded   counsel's   submission   that   there   were    "exceptional
    circumstances", including the failure by the respondent  to  reconsider
    the appellant's husband's application to take account of the fact  that
    he had, subsequent to the  date  of  application,  completed  10  years
    lawful residence, and that when the husband appellant was granted leave
    to remain for a period  of  2  years  on  22  June  2015,  it  was  the
    appellant's husband contention that the evidence of  the  knowledge  of
    life in the United Kingdom/English-language  requirements  had  already
    been submitted and if the Home Office had dealt with his case  properly
    on 22 June he would have been granted indefinite leave to remain rather
    than the 2 years limited leave, and  had  he  been  granted  indefinite
    leave to remain the couple would have had a legitimate expectation that
    the appellant's application as his dependent would have been granted in
    line. Expecting the appellant's return to Russia was  disproportionate.
    Making a fresh application would take 30 to 60 days, financial evidence
    extending back to a period of 6 months would be  required  which  would
    put the appellant  and  her  husband  under  a  burden  in  respect  of
    providing the proof, the appellant would also  have  to  undertake  the
    K0LL test and there would be difficulty with  the  accommodation  which
    they have, so that the parties would have  difficulty  in  meeting  the
    requirements, and it would be likely that they  would  have  a  gap  of
    several months before a valid application  could  be  made  so  that  a
    lengthy separation would result. Mr Khan had a fluctuating salary shown
    at page 125 of the appellant's bundle  to  be,  in  April  2016,  gross
    earnings of approximately �23,519. And his continuing  income  to  vary
    between �1200-�2900 a month. On  qualification,  he  expected  to  earn
    between �30-�35,000 a year.  He  would  not  accompany  her  to  Russia
    because his income would be required in order to support an application
    for her return to the United Kingdom and the couple wanted to  live  in
    the United Kingdom because when the  appellant's  husband  had  visited
    with his wife to Russia there had been an incident  when  he  had  been
    racially abused in a supermarket when someone had said that  he  should
    go home, and he would be unable to obtain suitable employment given his
    language difficulties. There was no issue that the  couple  would  have
    the support of the appellant's family and the appellant  herself  would
    be likely to obtain employment.

 5. Judge Malcolm found that the appellant's husband would have to  make  a
    decision as to whether they both went to Russia or if it was  just  the
    appellant, but concluded that any separation would only be for a  short
    period of time. Noting that the appellant did not meet the requirements
    of the rules, and despite the history of the case, the judge  concluded
    that the history of the case did not  meet  the  test  of  "exceptional
    circumstances".

 6. The appellant was granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on
    the basis that the judge had failed to make any findings regarding  the
    appellant's contention that her and her  husband's  relationship  would
    not be accepted by Russian society, all the difficulties the  appellant
    would face meeting the financial and  accommodation  requirements,  and
    had applied an exceptional circumstances test rather than the  test  of
    whether or not there were compelling circumstances.  The  grounds  also
    averred that the judge had failed to  factor  in  to  the  question  of
    proportionality the procedural unfairness in  how  the  respondent  had
    dealt with the application.  The  judge  granting  permission  did  not
    accept that that argument had been raised before judge Malcolm.

 7. In the rule 24 response the respondent defended the judge's decision on
    the basis that the judge was bound to consider the position through the
    lens of the rules and that there needed to be  evidence  of  compelling
    circumstances to warrant consideration outside of  the  rules,  further
    that it was not for the judge to decide whether or not  an  application
    might or might not succeed, but simply to take  into  account  that  an
    application could be made.

 8. Before me Mr Briddock reiterated the history of the case and  submitted
    that the Home Office had made a  mistake  when  failing  to  grant  the
    appellant's partner indefinite  leave  to  remain  in  June  2015.  The
    appellant husband's assertion  that  the  relevant  evidence  had  been
    before the Home Office prior was born out  by  the  fact  that  he  was
    granted indefinite leave to remain effectively across  the  counter  in
    July 2016. Judge Malcolm had inadequately reasoned  why  only  a  short
    separation would be required in the event that the appellant's  husband
    chose not to accompany the appellant to Russia, and the  inference  was
    that the reason the judge concluded that  the  appellant  could  go  to
    Russia was because it was for a short period. There was  evidence  that
    the  appellant  would  have  difficulty  meeting  the   financial   and
    accommodation requirements, so that the conclusion that it  would  only
    be for a short period was unsustainable. The judge's reference  to  the
    history  of  the  application   failing   to   meet   the   exceptional
    circumstances  test  was  a  straightforward  incorrect  self-direction
    amounting to an error of law.

 9. Mr Melvin asked me to find that the judges  use  the  word  exceptional
    rather than compelling circumstances was not relevant. The decision  in
    the round showed that there had been sufficient  consideration  of  the
    appellant's circumstances including the submission  that  but  for  the
    respondent's mistake the appellant's husband would have achieved settle
    status in 2015. Counsel on the day Mr Rahman  had  submitted  that  the
    delay of the respondent in agreeing to withdraw the decisions  and  the
    time taken to reconsider the applications amounted a circumstance  that
    made the decision disproportionate, but the reality  is  that  at  time
    when these applications were made neither the appellant nor her husband
    had any legitimate basis to remain  under  the  rules.  Even  when  the
    husband's application was granted the appellant's  application  as  the
    partner would have to have been considered  subject  to  the  financial
    requirements, and there is no evidence as to that position so  that  it
    was not a certainty, as suggested by counsel, that the respondent would
    have granted the application  of  the  appellant  "in  line  with"  her
    husband.

10. He submitted there was nothing  in  the  point  about  the  history  of
    dealing with the application that revealed unfairness, and the  judge's
    conclusion that the history did  not  reveal  circumstances  warranting
    leave outside of the immigration rules was adequately reasoned when the
    decision was read as a whole.

11. In terms of the judge's reference to exceptional circumstances  it  was
    wrong to isolate the use of the term  exceptional  circumstances.  When
    reading the decision in the round it becomes clear that the  judge  was
    simply dealing with the submission of  the  appellant  which  had  been
    framed in the context of the  circumstances  constituting  "exceptional
    circumstances". The reality was that the factual matrix  did  not  meet
    the  threshold  whether  the  test  was  described  as  compelling   or
    exceptional.

12. In reply Mr Briddock invited me to infer from  Mr  Melvin's  submission
    that he accepted that the judge had fallen into an error of law by  not
    looking  at  compelling  circumstances  but  looking   at   exceptional
    circumstances, and that  the  issue  before  me  was  the  question  of
    materiality. The judge had referred  to  exceptional  circumstances  at
    both paragraph 67 and 68. On the face of the  decision  the  judge  had
    applied too high a threshold, the application  of  the  incorrect  test
    can't be brushed aside. So far as the issue of delay was concerned  the
    point being made before me was not about the delay but about  the  fact
    that there had been a mistake made  by  the  Home  Office  because  the
    appellant's husband  should  have  been  granted  indefinite  leave  to
    remain. The husband did not need the  life  in  the  UK  test  and  the
    English language requirements were  met  by  his  degree.  Although  Mr
    Melvin  said  that  the  evidence  did  not  show  that  the  financial
    requirements were met, so  that  it  could  not  be  certain  that  the
    respondent would  have  granted  the  appellant's  application  as  the
    partner of someone with indefinite leave to remain, the evidence of the
    appellant and her husband  recorded  by  the  judge  in  the  decision,
    indicated that the salaries of the appellant and  her  husband  at  the
    time were well above what was required, so that it was very likely that
    the application would have been granted.

Discussion

13. I find that when the judge  refers  to  Mr  Rahman's  reliance  on  the
    history of the respondent's dealing with the appellant's application it
    is quite clear that the judge had in mind the arguments  reiterated  by
    Mr Briddock today, because they are set  out  in  the  context  of  the
    submissions recorded between paragraphs 41 and  49  of  the  judgement,
    albeit that it appears that counsel on the day did not go so far as  to
    allege unfairness of process. I find that  the  judge  who  dealt  with
    permission was right  to  identify  that  there  is  no  merit  in  the
    assertion of error of law for failing  to  deal  with  an  argument  of
    unfairness because the case had not been argued in that way.  I  accept
    Mr Melvin's submission that the position that the respondent  ought  to
    have granted indefinite leave to remain is at best speculative.  I note
    that  it  wasn't  the  appellant's  case   that   at   the   point   of
    reconsideration she, through her legal representatives, had invited the
    respondent,  whether  by  varying   the   application   following   the
    respondent's withdrawal of the decision, or informally by dint  of  the
    representations submitted, had proposed  to  the  respondent  that  she
    should be considered as the partner of someone with indefinite leave to
    remain, and provided the  necessary  supporting  evidence.  Whilst  the
    respondent might have dealt with the application differently that falls
    far short of establishing unfairness of  process  given  that  she  was
    dealing with the application  in  the  way  in  which  the  appellant's
    representatives had invited her to do so. In the context  of  contested
    proceedings  where  the  appellant  was   represented   Mr   Briddock's
    assertions that the fact  of  the  appellant's  partner  being  granted
    indefinite leave to remain in 2016, one year later, even  if  over-the-
    counter, is not determinative of the respondent having made  a  mistake
    in June 2015. Indeed, as much is recognised by Mr  Rahman's  submission
    to judge Malcolm, when he describes the evidence as  suggestive  rather
    than clear. I find no merit in ground one.

14. I turn to ground two, asserting  incomplete  findings  upon  which  the
    judge conducted the proportionality test.  The  grounds  refer  to  the
    appellant's integration into the community, of her  activities  in  the
    UK, and of her friends. It is also said that the judge failed  to  make
    any findings in respect of the evidence  of  the  racist  incident,  or
    factored into the balance the length of time the appellant has lived in
    the United Kingdom, or that expecting the appellant to return to Russia
    to make an application for entry clearance  from  abroad  was,  on  the
    facts, for reasons of formality as opposed to  substance.  Mr  Briddock
    put  the  case  slightly  differently,  arguing  that  the  judge   had
    inadequately reasoned the conclusion that any separation would be for a
    short time. I find no merit in  that  submission  because  the  judge's
    decision makes it plain that counsel on  the  day  submitted  that  the
    difficulties in meeting the  requirements  were  not  substantive,  but
    related to the length of time he estimated was  needed  to  obtain  and
    collate the necessary evidence including the taking of the  KOLL  test.
    His estimate was that it was likely  that  there  would  be  a  gap  of
    several months followed by 30 to 60 days that the embassy  would  take.
    The judge was entirely entitled to conclude at paragraph 66  that  even
    if the couple decided that only the appellant returns to Russia "it  is
    likely that such separation would only be for a short period of  time."
    Similarly, is quite clear from the judge's findings at paragraph 63  to
    66, in which all of the difficulties that the appellant  relied  on  in
    terms of her and/or  her  husband  returning  to  Russia  together  are
    mentioned, and apparently taken at their highest, did not persuade  the
    judge on balance that it was unreasonable to expect the husband to  go,
    because the judge concludes that the choice remains open to them. It is
    not suggested that that is a perverse conclusion. I find  no  merit  in
    the 2nd ground.

15. The third and final ground of appeal relates to the  reference  in  the
    final paragraphs of the decision, at 67 and 68 to a test of exceptional
    circumstances. The ground fails to read the decision in  its  entirety.
    It overlooks the correct self-direction at paragraph 58 where the judge
    identifies  the  judicial  task  as  assessing  the   extent   of   the
    interference with the appellant's private and family life and balancing
    that against  the  legitimate  aim  of  the  maintenance  of  effective
    immigration controls and of public confidence in their maintenance.  Mr
    Melvin was right when he remarks that the  choice  of  words  may  have
    reflected the way in which counsel on the day referred to  "exceptional
    circumstances". This was the language of the refusal  letter  too.  The
    case of Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11 has  made  it  explicit  that  there  is
    nothing inherently wrong in referring to exceptional  circumstances  so
    long as it is not too narrowly interpreted to  reveal  a  threshold  of
    unique or a one off.  Reading the decision as a whole  it  is  apparent
    that the judge has not applied a threshold that is too  high.  I  find,
    taking account of the decision as a whole, the correct  self-direction,
    and the way in which the case was argued, that the judge's reference to
    a test of exceptional circumstances was merely infelicitous,  simply  a
    reflection of the language used, and that the correct substantive  test
    of compelling circumstances was applied.

Decision

16. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing the  appeal  is  not
    vitiated by legal error and it stands.
