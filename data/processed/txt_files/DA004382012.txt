Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms M H Rasoul instructed by Blavo & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs R Pettersen, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of the  People's  Republic  of  China,  from
    Fujian province, born on 5 May 1982 and now 29 years old.   The  First-
    tier Tribunal did not make  an  anonymity  order  and  nothing  in  the
    materials before me indicates that I should make one.

 2. The appellant appeals with permission against the determination of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Mathews  and  Ms  J  A
    Endersby,  a  non-legal  member)  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of State to remove him as a foreign  criminal
    pursuant to Section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007.   The  respondent
    was not satisfied that the appellant fell within any of the  exceptions
    to automatic deportation   set out in Section 33 of that  Act,  and  in
    particular she was not satisfied that he came  within  Exception  1  in
    s.33(2)  on  the  basis  of  having  relevant  convention  or   Refugee
    Convention rights which would be breached by his removal.

Background

 3. The appellant came to the United Kingdom on 8 September 2001,  using  a
    Japanese passport to which he was not entitled and the name of Li  Hua.
    He was on his way to Canada on a flight from Malaga, allegedly to  join
    an aunt who lived in Canada. He was given temporary admission  when  he
    asked  to  claim  asylum.   Although  he  was  told  to  report  to  an
    Immigration Officer the next day, the appellant absconded.

 4. On 3 April 2002, whilst still a minor, he was convicted of offences  of
    dishonesty including the possession of  a  false  instrument,  and  was
    sentenced to four months' imprisonment in a young offenders' institute.

 5. In February 2011, following an arrest in November 2010,  the  appellant
    pleaded guilty to being  involved  in  the  production  of  a  class  B
    controlled drug, cannabis, and was sentenced to two  years  in  prison.
    He did not appeal against either the conviction or  the  sentence.   He
    had been taking part in the cultivation of cannabis on a large scale in
    a house modified for a sophisticated cannabis operation, with potential
    yields of between �12,000 and �23,000 from the drugs being  cultivated.



 6. During his sentence on 28 June 2012, he was notified of  his  liability
    to automatic deportation, and claimed asylum, having by this time  been
    in the United Kingdom for almost eleven years.

First-tier Tribunal determination

 7. The Refugee Convention basis  relied  upon  for  Exception  1  was  the
    appellant's account of his flight from China after the forced  purchase
    by local officials  of  a  business  owned  by  the  his  father.   The
    appellant's father had, he said, been detained for four  weeks  without
    charge or due process, and the same had happened to  his  brother.   An
    appeal to the governor of his home province was ineffectual.  There was
    a further detention and intimidation until  finally  a  friend  of  the
    appellant's father who worked  for  the  police  told  him  that  false
    charges of murder and corruption were to be brought against him.

 8. The appellant said that his father and the rest of his family  fled  to
    North America.  The appellant was living away from home and left  China
    separately for Canada, with the  help  of  an  agent  arranged  by  his
    father.

 9. The human rights element relied upon was the appellant's a relationship
    with Ms Xue Hua Lin and they have a daughter together,  born  while  he
    was in custody.  Ms Lin visited him with the child  during  his  prison
    sentence.  The appellant has been on bail since September  2012,  which
    has afforded him an opportunity to get to  know  his  daughter  better.
    She is now about 18 months old.

The First-tier Tribunal determination

10. The First-tier Tribunal  heard  evidence  from  Ms  Lin  and  from  the
    appellant.  Ms Lin said she had been the sole carer for their  daughter
    since her birth.  The appellant had been  in  prison  and  his  claimed
    family in the United States had not offered any financial support.  She
    wished that he could remain with them in the  United  Kingdom  so  that
    they could be  a  family.   A  statement  purporting  to  be  from  the
    appellant's father in the United States was considered;  it  was  brief
    and gave no details of his experiences in China. There was no  evidence
    from the appellant's Canadian aunt, or of her existence, except in that
    letter.

11. The First-tier Tribunal considered that there was  a  general  lack  of
    consistency in the appellant's account, such that they found him to  be
    'a man lacking entirely in credibility...who frequently uses dishonesty
    and criminal actions to further his own ends'.  The  appellant's  claim
    that he could bring himself within  s.33(2)(b)  by  raising  an  asylum
    claim was rejected, along with the whole of his core account.

12. The Tribunal then considered under  s.33(2)(a)  whether  the  appellant
    could show the statutory exception  for  Convention  rights  under  the
    ECHR, in particular Article 8 thereof.  DNA evidence had been  provided
    establishing that the appellant was indeed the father of Ms Lin's  baby
    daughter. Ms Lin had not referred to the relationship  during  her  own
    application for asylum or other leave to remain in the United  Kingdom.
     Ms Lin  had  not  disclosed  the  basis  on  which  she  had  obtained
    indefinite  leave  to  remain  and  she  also  had  been  convicted  of
    dishonesty offences.   They accepted that Ms Lin had taken the child to
    visit the appellant in prison, and that the appellant, Ms Lin  and  the
    child had private and family life together.

13. Article 8 was engaged, and the first four of the Razgar questions posed
    no difficulty.  The appellant had submitted that Article 8  within  the
    Rules was not applicable to him and that he could succeed, if  at  all,
    only under Article 8 outwith the Rules.   That does not appear to  have
    been contentious before the First-tier Tribunal. The appellant had seen
    his daughter only occasionally in prison; her mother had been her  sole
    carer; and the appellant and Ms Lin had never  lived  together  at  the
    date of the First-tier Tribunal  hearing.  The  Tribunal  balanced  the
    private and family life against the public interest, having  regard  to
    the seriousness of the appellant's offence and concluded  that  despite
    the possibility of the  appellant's  relationship  with  Ms  Lin  being
    enhanced on his release, the limited relationship existing between them
    and the child in September 2012 was not  sufficient  to  make  out  the
    exception in s.33(2)(b).

14. The First-tier Tribunal concluded that deportation of the appellant was
    proportionate and dismissed the appeal.

Permission to Appeal

15. First-tier Judge McWilliam granted permission to appeal  on  the  basis
    that the First-tier Tribunal had failed to give  sufficient  weight  to
    family life and private life existing between the  appellant,  and  his
    partner and daughter, both of  whom  are  now  British  citizens.   The
    appellant's case was that insufficient weight had  been  given  to  the
    best interests of the child, there was no assessment of the appellant's
    asylum claim, and  she  considered  it  arguable  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had failed  properly  to  apply  Sanade  and  others  (British
    children - Zambrano - Dereci) [2012] UKUT 00048 (IAC) and ZH Tanzania v
    SSHD [2011] UKSC 4.

16. The judge considered that whilst it was open to the First-tier Tribunal
    to dismiss the deportation appeal despite the separation of the  family
    it was incumbent upon them to give reasons why this  was  proportionate
    and necessary, which she considered an arguable error of law.

Respondent's r.24 Reply

17. The respondent replied under Rule 24 opposing the appeal and submitting
    that the First-tier Tribunal had directed  itself  appropriately.   The
    notice continues:

         "3.  The judge had regard to the very specific facts of the case in
             respect of the appellant and his daughter.  In  the  light  of
             those facts the conclusion that the welfare of the  child  was
             not such as to indicate a  disproportionate  interference  did
             not result from the respondent's decision.

         4.   The judge was entitled to note that there was no apparent risk
             to the appellant's partner in China."

18. The respondent requested an oral hearing.  That was the basis on  which
    the appeal came before me.

Upper Tribunal hearing

19. At the beginning of the hearing, I was asked to renew bail on the  same
    terms which I did.  I was asked to, and did,  receive  additional  oral
    evidence from the appellant.  On  this  occasion,  there  was  no  oral
    evidence from Ms Lin. I heard oral  submissions,  and  gave  leave  for
    further written submissions on country guidance  relating  to  internal
    relocation within China.

Oral Evidence

20. The appellant adopted the evidence set out in a witness statement dated
    1 August 2012;  he confirmed that he had checked it with the assistance
    of a translator in Mandarin which is the language which he  speaks.  He
    now said that his real name was Li Hua,  and  that  Ming  Chen  was  an
    alias, a false name which he gave.

21. The appellant is not a married man.  In his evidence, he accepted  that
    he had told the Immigration Officer that he had a  wife  and  child  in
    China.  He had done so because he was very worried about being deported
    and the agent had advised him that this  was  the  best  way  to  avoid
    deportation.

22.  The  appellant's  account  was  that  his  father  was  a   successful
    businessman who had five seafood restaurants in three different cities:
    three in Fu Zhou City, the central city  of  Fujian  Province  and  two
    others, one in Lianjiang and one in San Ming.   The  appellant  managed
    one of the shops in Fu Zhou, while his father remained in the oldest of
    the shops in Lianjiang.

23. The attempted takeover of the  family's  restaurants  occurred  at  the
    behest of officials in Lianjiang and criminal charges were laid against
    the family members.  The appellant stated that the  false  charges  had
    also been reported to the police station in Fu Zhou, the capital  city.
    The appellant was not detained at that time: he was living in the  shop
    in Fu Zhou and not at home, but his father  and  younger  brother  were
    detained.

24. In cross-examination, the appellant confirmed  that  the  rest  of  his
    family had left China at the end of 2000.  He said at first that he had
    not met them before they left to go to Korea and that he had not  found
    out until an aunt told him, after the appellant arrived in Canada.

25. The appellant had been working in the restaurant in Fu  Zhou  employing
    almost twenty staff.  The officials had taken it over when he went into
    hiding.  He did not know who they were.  He was only concerned with his
    own safety and he was very mobile and of  no  fixed  abode  so  he  had
    travelled to Shan Zi Province, Shanbei Province,   Kungming  in  Yunnan
    Province and Guanzhou in Guangdong Province.  No one had  come  to  the
    restaurant to tell him to leave.

26. He said his father had managed to call him and tell him that they  were
    going to flee and he had simply left the restaurant for the  government
    people without telling the staff anything.  He  simply  ran  away.   To
    travel to the four other areas that he had  named  he  took  buses  and
    trains using money which was in the shop  which  he  was  managing  and
    which he had taken.  The appellant was neither charged nor arrested  in
    any of the three or four  provinces  to  which  he  travelled  but  his
    understanding was  that  the  whole  family,  including  the  appellant
    himself, had been charged with criminal offences.

27. It was put to the appellant that previously his account had  been  that
    the charges were against his father alone:   the  appellant  said  that
    the charges had been laid first against  his  brother  and  father  and
    later against the whole family.  He thought that that was what  he  had
    said in his witness statement.  When  pressed,  the  appellant  gave  a
    variety of answers and eventually said that he had found out about  the
    charges when  he  was  already  overseas  from  his  maternal  aunt  in
    approximately February 2002, after the appellant arrived in the  United
    Kingdom.  She had told him that there were warrants  around  issued  in
    2000 for all the family. His aunt had told him  that  the  warrant  was
    everywhere where she lived and that she had seen it.

28. The appellant had three aunts,  two  still  in  China.   He  habitually
    phoned them on Chinese New Year each year, including in 2013, but apart
    from that, he seldom  contacted  them.    His  evidence  was  that  his
    Chinese aunts were still  telling  him  not  to  come  back  since  the
    warrants were everywhere in the region, for  everyone  in  the  family,
    with all of their photographs.

29. The appellant was asked about copy documents which he had  submitted  ,
    purporting to show that his parents  had  permanent  residence  in  the
    United States.  He could not say on what basis the family had  obtained
    permanent residence because he said that when they got it in  2000  his
    father had thrown away all the  documents  only,  retaining  the  green
    card.  The names on the residence permits  were  not  those  which  the
    appellant had given as his parents' names.

30. A letter was produced, purporting to be from  the  appellant's  father,
    using the new name, and stating that the writer had left China in 2001.
    When asked why  the  letter  mentioned  2001,  rather  than  2000,  the
    appellant said that the later date was 'impossible', since his father's
    flight took place in the year 2000.

31. In answer to questions from me, the appellant explained that he had  an
    aunt in, in Lianjiang Province, and another  in  Zhejiang  Province  in
    Wenzhlu City.  It was the auntie in Wenzhlu who had told him about  the
    warrants in Lianjiang; the Lianjiang aunt had  telephoned  the  Wenzhlu
    aunt to give her the information.

32. The official who had caused his family all this trouble was  now  of  a
    higher rank and therefore a longer reach within China.  He did not know
    who was running the restaurants now; it was impossible for him  to  get
    the information.  His aunts dared not  ask  in  case  it  caused  their
    families trouble.

33. There was no re-examination.

Submissions

34. In submissions, Ms Rasoul relied on her skeleton argument prepared  for
    the First-tier Tribunal, and on  the  respondent's  Country  of  Origin
    Information, although she accepted that there she had made no reference
    to any of the Tribunal's country guidance in relation  to  China.   The
    appellant had made an illegal exit from China.

35. Ms Rasoul argued that the Tribunal had given insufficient weight to the
    British citizenship of the appellant's partner,  by  naturalisation  in
    March 2011, and their child who was born after the grant of  indefinite
    leave to remain and was therefore herself a British citizen  at  birth.
    The reason why indefinite leave was granted to the appellant's  partner
    was not given in the letter of grant but she had made an asylum  claim.
    The parties were not currently married but they  had  been  co-habiting
    since the appellant had been released on bail in September 2012.  There
    were no further children.

36. The future of  both  mother  and  child  had  been  recognised  by  the
    respondent as being in the United Kingdom and the  appellant's  removal
    would result in a lengthy  severance  of  essential  family  ties.   Ms
    Rasoul submitted that the best interests of the child were to stay with
    her mother in the United Kingdom; the child had been introduced to  her
    father on prison visits while he was still detained and  had  now  been
    living with him in a family unit for several months.  Particular weight
    should be given to the fact that he would be  barred  from  re-entering
    the United Kingdom for a further ten years at an essential stage of his
    daughter's life, leaving him with no family life  or  personal  contact
    with her.

37. The panel had not assessed the  substance  of  the  appellant's  asylum
    account.  The appellant should not be criticised  for  having  said  on
    entry that his parents were still in China because the agent  had  told
    him to make that false statement.  The appellant had produced copies of
    his father's green card in America which was strong evidence  that  the
    father had been granted refugee status in America although there was no
    formal confirmation that this had occurred.  The appellant  should  not
    be criticised for any delay in claiming asylum since  he  was  a  minor
    when  he  came  to  the  United  Kingdom.   He  had  made  two   asylum
    applications both of which had been rejected by the Secretary of State.



38. Given that there were false criminal  charges  against  the  family  in
    their home area, the persecutory risk should be  regarded  as  existing
    throughout China and therefore the question of internal flight was  not
    relevant.  The appellant had given a credible account  of  difficulties
    faced by his family and the veracity of his evidence should be regarded
    as confirmed by the asylum grant to his family in  the  United  States.
    He had explained the discrepancies between his initial account and  his
    new account in his witness  statement.   Internal  flight  was  not  an
    option because there would be checks on return, particularly as he  had
    made an illegal exit.  She would make written  submissions  on  country
    guidance after the hearing.

39. Ms Rasoul accepted that the charge against the appellant was a  serious
    one but submitted that the appellant had  brought  himself  within  the
    s.33 exception; there was extensive case law indicating that the denial
    of access to one parent was always disproportionate and in this context
    she relied  on  ZH  (Tanzania)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2011] UKSC 4, Beoku-Betts v Secretary of State for the Home
    Department [2008] UKHL 39, and Harrison (Jamaica) and  AB  (Morocco)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 1736.

40. Ms Lin had applied for refugee status in 2005 and the couple had met in
    2006 so it was not surprising that he had not  been  mentioned  in  her
    application.  The appellant's claim for leave  to  remain  outside  the
    Rules had been made in 2011.  Ms Rasoul asked me to allow the appeal.

41. In her written submission on country guidance, Ms Rasoul stated that AX
    (family planning scheme) China CG [2012] UKUT 97 (IAC) was  of  limited
    relevance since it dealt with internal relocation in the context  of  a
    breach of the family planning policy not a criminal offence  which  had
    received  the  significant  internal   publicity   claimed   for   this
    appellant's family situation. She relied on the summary of  AX  (China)
    in the respondent's OGN, in particular paragraph 14 of the italic words
    in that case:

         "Internal relocation

         (14) Where a real risk exists  in  the  'hukou'  area,  it  may  be
         possible to avoid the risk by moving to a city. Millions of Chinese
         internal migrants, male and female, live and work in  cities  where
         they do not hold an 'urban hukou'.   Internal  migrant  women  are
         required to stay in touch with their 'hukou' area and either return
         for tri-monthly pregnancy tests or else  send  back  test  results.
         The country evidence does not indicate a  real  risk  of  effective
         pursuit of  internal  migrant  women  leading  to  forcible  family
         planning actions, sterilisation or  termination,  taking  place  in
         their city of migration. Therefore, internal relocation will,  in
         almost all cases, avert the  risk  in  the  hukou  area.   However,
         internal relocation  may  not  be  safe  where  there  is  credible
         evidence of individual pursuit  of  the  returnee  or  her  family,
         outside the 'hukou' area. Whether it is unduly harsh to  expect  an
         individual returnee and her family to relocate in this way will  be
         a question of fact in each case."

42. If there really were criminal charges against  the  appellant  and  his
    family members, the risk would exist throughout China,  for  which  she
    relied upon paragraphs 6.01-6.03, 8.05, 11.01-11.07,  17.01-17.03,  and
    34.03-34.12 of the respondent's current Country of  Origin  Report  for
    China.  If the appellant's account were to be accepted there  would  be
    no feasible internal relocation for him.

43. For the Secretary of State, Mrs Pettersen indicated that bail  was  not
    opposed and the appellant had been complying with his bail  conditions.
    The credibility probabilities had been exacerbated rather than resolved
    by the appellant's oral  evidence,  which  was  embellished  above  and
    beyond the evidence in his witness statement and produced  yet  further
    contradictions in his account.

44. Taken at its highest, the asylum  claim  was  that  the  appellant  had
    problems with local officials in China in the late 1990s and there  was
    unlikely to be a real risk even in the home area, given  the  lapse  of
    time.  There was no credible evidence that the authorities in the  home
    area had any desire to pursue any charges against the appellant or  his
    family or indeed that such charges actually existed.  He  could  return
    to any other large city in China without difficulty  and  even  in  his
    home area it was unlikely that there was any continuing interest  since
    the officials have now obtained the businesses that they sought if  his
    account were  to  be  believed  and  would  not  want  to  bring  their
    corruption to anyone's attention.

45. The appellant, as a person with a serious criminal  conviction  in  the
    United Kingdom, would not now be permitted to rejoin his parents in the
    United States and would be excluded from the  United  Kingdom  for  ten
    years.  The child was now 1� years old and would  be  unable  to  spend
    time with her father until she was almost 12 years old.

46. The best interests of the child were to remain with its  mother;  given
    that the child was very young and the mother was the primary carer, the
    deportation of the appellant would not  adversely  affect  the  child's
    best interests.  It was open to the family to decide whether to live in
    China, although she accepted that the  appellant's  partner  and  child
    could not be expected to do so, given that the Secretary of  State  had
    accepted that their future lay in the United Kingdom.

47. The point of the Harrison case was that this  appellant's  partner  and
    child could not be expelled from the United Kingdom because  the  child
    was entitled to exercise her EU citizenship as indeed was  her  mother.
    However the removal of the appellant was proportionate.  He had a  poor
    immigration history and had committed  a  serious  offence.   When  the
    appellant's partner made her application for indefinite leave  she  had
    failed to mention the relationship.  The balance should be regarded  as
    tilting towards  removal  rather  than  allowing  him  to  develop  the
    relationship further and she invited me to  dismiss  the  appeal.   The
    respondent did not make any additional submissions on country  guidance
    and internal relocation.

48. I reserved my decision which I now give.

Discussion

49. The grounds of appeal, and the permission given, raise three points:

          a) Whether the First-tier Tribunal assessed properly  the  asylum
             claim made by the appellant;

          b) Whether the First-tier  Tribunal  gave  sufficient  weight  to
             family life and private life existing between  the  appellant,
             and his partner and daughter, both of  whom  are  now  British
             citizens; and if so,

          c) Whether they  gave  sufficient  reasons  why  deportation  was
             nevertheless proportionate and necessary.

50. I remind myself that the appellant had  committed  a  serious  criminal
    offence; he was involved in cannabis farming on a very large scale  and
    received a two-year prison sentence.  He had not pursued an opportunity
    to claim asylum in 2001.  He  had  an  earlier  offence  for  which  he
    received four months in a young offenders'  institute.    There  is  no
    doubt that he comes within  the  automatic  deportation  provisions  in
    section 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007. Section 32(4) says that, save as
    set out in the exemptions in s.33, for the purposes of s.3(5)(a) of the
    Immigration Act 1971, deportation of a foreign criminal is conducive to
    the public good.

51. The question is whether he can bring himself within the s.33 exceptions
    to such automatic deportation.   The relevant exception is Exception 1,
    set out at s.33(2):

         "33(2)   Exception 1 is where removal of the  foreign  criminal  in
         pursuance of the deportation order would breach-
         (a)  a person's Convention rights, or
         (b)   the  United   Kingdom's   obligations   under   the   Refugee
         Convention."

52. Dealing first with the Refugee Convention, I note that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal found  the  appellant's  evidence  to  be  wholly  lacking  in
    credibility.  His  evidence  before  me  did  nothing  to  improve  his
    credibility.  I  do  not  accept  that  the  Tribunal  failed  to  deal
    adequately with his asylum argument, since they stated  that  they  did
    not believe any of his account.   Paragraphs  28-32  are  a  sufficient
    analysis of the asylum element of his Exception 1 argument,  given  his
    low credibility.

53.  Even allowing for  the  lower  standard  of  proof  required  for  the
    international protection Conventions, and even (which is not the  case)
    had I found the core claim to be credible, I would have considered that
    the appellant had an internal flight alternative.  On his own  account,
    he lived in at  least  four  provinces  before  coming  to  the  United
    Kingdom, and China is an enormous country with very many people  living
    away from home.  There is no credible evidence of  continuing  interest
    in the appellant or in his family; the documents from America are  poor
    photocopies of documents for which the underlying reason for  grant  is
    not available, the persons in question do not have the  same  names  as
    the appellant, and the date of their leaving China is a year later than
    he claims that his family left.  I am unable to place any weight at all
    on those documents.  I reject the appellant's claim to  the  s.33(2)(b)
    exception on Refugee Convention grounds.

54. I turn therefore to s.33(2)(a) and the ECHR element of the  appellant's
    Exception 1 argument.  I must consider the weight to be  given  to  the
    appellant's relationship with his partner and her child and to the best
    interests of that child.  I note that before  his  prison  sentence  in
    2011, the appellant was not in  a  co-habiting  relationship  with  his
    partner, although it is established that he is the parent  of  her  18-
    month old daughter.  His partner and her daughter are British  citizens
    and are entitled to remain in the United Kingdom.  The child is  an  EU
    citizen and has the right to be brought up within the EU.  Following ZH
    (Tanzania), she also has the right to be the full benefit of her United
    Kingdom citizenship, by growing up in the United Kingdom.  She is  very
    young and her links with the appellant are confined in  practice  to  a
    few prison visits and about six months' co-habitation under the age  of
    two.

55. The appellant did not cohabit with Ms Lin until he came out of  prison.
    I am not satisfied that the links which exist between the appellant and
    his daughter are so strong that  they  ought  to  outweigh  the  public
    interest in deporting to  his  country  of  origin  a  person  who  was
    involved with a cannabis  farm  involving  large  scale  production  of
    cannabis and who received a two year prison sentence in connection with
    that involvement.  It is unfortunate that in  consequence  he  will  be
    unable to visit his daughter in the United Kingdom  for  the  next  ten
    years but that is the consequence of his actions, but it  remains  open
    to Ms Lin to arrange visits to him in China, or perhaps elsewhere,  and
    the relationship can be maintained by modern means of communication.

56. I had reached the above  conclusions  before  the  publication  of  the
    judgment of the Court of Appeal in SS (Nigeria) v  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 550.  The observations of  Lord
    Justice Laws at paragraphs 53-55 and of Mr Justice Mann at paragraph 62
    of that decision fortify me  in  my  approach  to  the  proportionality
    question in this appeal.

57. There is no material error of law in the determination  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal and I decline to set it aside.





Conclusions

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law. I   do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal   did not make an order pursuant  to  Rule  45(4)(i)
of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
