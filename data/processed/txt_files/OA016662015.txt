                                   Between

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                                MARIA AFZAAL
                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Secretary of State has been granted permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
Tribunal against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing Ms  Afzaal's
appeal against the decision to refuse her entry clearance.

Ms Afzaal has advised the Upper Tribunal, in her letter of 14 January  2016,
that she does not resist the Secretary of State's appeal as she is making  a
fresh application for entry clearance.

In the circumstances, the Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper  Tribunal
is allowed, with the effect that the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
allowing the appeal is set aside, such that  the  decision  in  Ms  Afzaal's
appeal  against  the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  refusing  her  entry
clearance has to be re-made.

In view of Ms Afzaal's confirmation that she does not resist  the  Secretary
of State's appeal, and considering her confirmation  in  her  letter  of  20
December 2015 that she wants to withdraw her appeal and make a  fresh  entry
clearance application, I formally re-make the  decision  in  her  appeal  by
dismissing it.

DECISION

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law. The decision has been set  aside.  I  re-make
the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.




                               Signed
