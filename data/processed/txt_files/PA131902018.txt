For the Appellant:     Mr H Kannangara (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal against a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  (C
    Andrews)  ("FtT")  promulgated  on  12  February  2019  in  which   the
    appellant's appeal against a decision to refuse to grant her asylum and
    humanitarian protection and on human rights grounds was dismissed.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of China born on 19 August 1988.  She has  a
    child born on 1 May 2018 who is a British citizen and  her  partner  is
    also a British citizen.  At the date of hearing the  child  was  around
    nine months old.

3.      In considering Article 8 the FtT  found  that  the  public  interest
    outweighed the private interest of the  appellant  and  her  child.  It
    found that the best interest of the child lay in  remaining  with  both
    parents [15]. The  FtT  found  that  the  wording  in  section  117B(6)
    "require" did not mean that " a removal of a person who has engaged  in
    blatant disregard of the immigration laws can simply be  brushed  aside
    by me" [18]. It found that the appellant could return to  China  either
    with  or  without  her  partner  and  child  and  from  there  make  an
    application for entry clearance.  "All of the choices are reasonable  "
    [20].

Grounds of appeal

4.   In grounds of appeal it was argued that the First-tier Tribunal  failed
    to  take  into  account  that  there  was  a  genuine  and   subsisting
    relationship between the appellant and her British citizen partner  and
    child.  The First-tier Tribunal  failed  to  consider  where  the  best
    interests of the child lay in terms of the country [15].  The FtT erred
    in its  assessment  of  best  interests  and  whether  or  not  it  was
    reasonable to expect the child to leave the country by failing to  take
    into regard the fact that the child and partner were British  citizens.
    The FtT failed to follow the guidance in KO (Nigeria)[2018] UKSC 53 and
    Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40.  The FtT failed to take  into  account
    that the appellant did not speak English and therefore in the event  of
    a return to China to make an application  for  entry  clearance,  there
    would be a considerable delay as she would have  to  learn  English  in
    order to meet the requirements of the Rules.  Finally,  it  was  argued
    that the First-tier Tribunal's  approach  to  Section  117B(6)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  ("section  117B(6)")  was
    entirely flawed.

Permission to Appeal

5.   Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Grubb  on  11
    June 2019.  The Upper Tribunal Judge considered that it was arguable at
    [14 to 19] that  the  FtT  misapplied  Section  117B(6)  especially  at
    paragraph 18 indicating that if  Section  117B(6)  applied  the  public
    interest does not require the appellant's removal irrespective  of  her
    "blatant disregard of immigration laws".

Rule 24 notice

6.    The respondent produced a Rule  24  Notice  opposing  the  application
    arguing  that  the  FtT  had  properly  considered  the   question   of
    "reasonableness" under section 117B(6) and concluded that  all  options
    were reasonable including the appellant who  had  no  lawful  leave  to
    remain to return to China.  The FtT was fully aware that the child  was
    a qualifying child and whose interests did not amount to a trump card.

Hearing

7.   At the hearing before me Mr Kannangara relied on the grounds of  appeal
    arguing that the FtT failed to assess the position in terms of the real
    life situation as per judicial guidance.  It had not been disputed that
    there was family life between the appellant, her partner and the child.
     The FtT had taken the view that the child could either remain  in  the
    UK with the partner or  go  to  China  with  the  appellant  where  the
    appellant would then make an application for entry clearance.  In  this
    assessment the FtT failed to adequately consider and take into  account
    that  the  child  was  a  British  citizen  which  had  to   be   given
    consideration in terms of his life and entitlement to live in  the  UK.
    The  FtT  failed  to  adopt  the  approach  in  JG  (Section   117B(6):
    "reasonable to leave" UK)  Turkey  [2019]  UKUT  72  (IAC)  and  in  AB
    (Jamaica).  The FtT's application of Section 117B(6) was  incorrect  in
    law.

8.   Mr Tarlow  sensibly  conceded  that  he  could  not  defend  the  FtT's
    decision and that there was  a  material  error  of  law.   He  further
    submitted that the proper course of  action  would  be  to  remake  the
    decision in the Upper Tribunal.

Decision

9.   I was satisfied that there were material errors of law in the  decision
    of First-tier Tribunal and that the two main  grounds  of  appeal  were
    made out.  The significant error was  the  FtT's  failure  to  properly
    apply Section 117B(6) having regard to the fact  that  the  appellant's
    partner and child were British citizens.  The FtT at [18]  has  clearly
    misunderstood paragraph 117B(6) in terms of  the  public  interest  and
    further misapplied  the  law  in  terms  of  taking  into  account  the
    appellant's conduct.  The FtT did not fully take into consideration the
    child's entitlement as a British citizen and it was unclear as to  what
    blatant disregard or misconduct the FtT was referring  to  as  being  a
    relevant factor. In misapplying the judgment by the Supreme Court in KO
    (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53 the FtT did not in fact consider the real life
    situation in this instance namely  that  the  partner  and  child  were
    British.

Error of law decision

10.  Accordingly I conclude that there were material errors of  law  in  the
    decision which I set aside.

Remaking the decision

11.  I decided to remake the decision as both parties consented  to  such  a
    course of action.

12.  Having regard to the evidence before the FtT I find that the appellant
    has a British citizen child who is a "qualifying" child and her partner
    is a British citizen.  The child was born in May 2018 and at the time
    of the hearing was some 9 months old and there is a genuine and
    subsisting parental relationship as between the appellant and her
    child. Article 8 ECHR is engaged as there is family life in the UK and
    the 5 steps in Razgar are met. Thereafter section 117B(6) falls to be
    considered in the context of the public interest. Section 117B(6)
    provides that "In the case of a person who is not liable to
    deportation, the public interest does not require the person's removal
    where-

         (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship
         with a qualifying child, and

         (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the
         United Kingdom."


13.  It would be entirely unreasonable and contrary to  the  best  interests
    of the child for him to be expected to leave the UK with his mother  in
    order for her to make an application for entry  clearance  from  China.
    At such a young age his interests lie in remaining  with  both  parents
    and given that he is a British citizen he has an entitlement to live in
    the UK as does his father.  The immigration history of the appellant is
    not a factor to be taken into account  in  considering  reasonableness.
    Section 117B(6) provides that  there  is  no  public  interest  in  the
    removal of a party where there is a qualifying  child  and  it  is  not
    reasonable to expect the child to  live  in  another  country.  In  the
    circumstances where the appellant did not speak English there would  be
    considerable delay for her to meet the requirements of  the  Rules  and
    this would not be in the interests of the child who would be  separated
    from his mother for an indefinite period.

14.  The law is confirmed in AB (Jamaica) [2019] EWCA 661 and JG (Section
    117B(6): "reasonable to leave" UK) Turkey [2019] UKUT 72 (IAC) in which
    it states Section 117B requires a court or Tribunal to hypothesise that
    the child in question would leave the UK, even if this is not likely to
    be the case and ask whether it would be reasonable to expect the child
    to do so.  At paragraph 59 of AB(Jamaica) Elias LJ in MA (Pakistan) was
    quoted where he said:

         "Looking at section 117B(6) free from authority, I would favour
         the argument of the appellants. The focus on paragraph (b) is
         solely on the child and I see no justification for reading the
         concept of reasonableness so as to include a consideration of the
         conduct and immigration history of the parents as part of an
         overall analysis of the public interest. I do not deny that this
         may result in some cases in undeserving applicants being allowed
         to remain, but that is not in my view a reason for distorting the
         language of the section. Moreover, in an appropriate case the
         Secretary of State could render someone liable to deportation, and
         thereby render him ineligible to rely on this provision, by
         certifying that his or her presence would not be conducive to the
         public good."


15.  Further with regard to Treebhawon and Others  (Section  117B(6)  [2015]
    UKUT 00674 (IAC) the court stated

               "In  Section  117B(6)   Parliament   has   proscribed   three
         conditions, namely


         (a)  the person concerned is not liable to deportation;
         (b)  such person has a genuine and subsisting relationship  with  a
             qualifying child, namely a person who is under the age  of  18
             and is a British  citizen  or  has  lived  in  the  UK  for  a
             continuous period of seven years or more; and


         (c)  it would not be reasonable to expect the qualifying  child  to
             leave the United Kingdom.

     Within this discrete regime, the statute proclaims  unequivocally  that
    where these three conditions are satisfied the public interest does not
    require the removal of the parent from the United  Kingdom.   Ambiguity
    there is none."

16.  In applying Section 117B(6) I am satisfied that on the evidence  before
    me all of those conditions are met and accordingly I  find  that  there
    can be no public interest in requiring the appellant to leave the UK in
    light of the fact that she has a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship
    with a British citizen child and it would be unreasonable to expect the
    child to leave the UK.

Decision

17.  I remake that decision and I substitute a decision to allow the  appeal
    on human rights grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
