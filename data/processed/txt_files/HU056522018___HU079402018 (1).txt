Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr J Gajjar of Counsel
For the respondent:    Mrs Willocks-Briscoe, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of Pakistan born on 1  October  96  and  22
    September 1982 respectively. They are husband and wife  and  they  have
    two children born on 2 July 2015 19 August 2017. They appealed  against
    the decisions of the respondent refusing them  leave  to  remain  under
    paragraph 322 (5) of  the  immigration  rules  and  Article  8  of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights. As the second  appellant's  appeal
    rests or falls with that of the first appellant, I shall  consider  the
    appeal of the first  appellant's  appeal  and  refer  to  him  as  "the
    appellant".

 2. Permission to appeal was generously granted First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Ford in a decision dated 6 October 2018 stating  that  it  is  arguable
    that the Judge when he found  that  the  appellant  had  engaged  in  a
    deliberate attempt to defraud, that the appellant's behaviour  did  not
    reach  the  high  threshold  under  the  relevant  paragraph   of   the
    immigration rules. The Judge also found that it was arguable  that  the
    Tribunal Failed to  adequately  consider  the  appellant  child's  best
    interest and the difficulties he will face  as  an  autistic  child  in
    Pakistan. The Judge gave permission to appeal on grounds 3  and  4  and
    said that there has been an arguable material error of law.

 3. The permission Judge said that section 322 (5) has a "high  threshold".
    In that regard I take into account the case of R (N)  v  Mental  Health
    Review Tribunal (Northern Region) [2005] EWCA Civ 1605, [2006] QB  468)
    Richards LJ stated at paragraph 62  that "Although there  is  a  single
    civil standard of proof on the balance of probabilities, it is flexible
    in its application. Thus the flexibility of the standard  lies  not  in
    any adjustment to the degree of probability required for an  allegation
    to be proved (such that a more serious allegation has to be proved to a
    higher degree of probability), but in the strength or  quality  of  the
    evidence that will in practice be required  for  an  allegation  to  be
    proved on the balance of  probabilities."   In  the  circumstances  the
    Judge applied standard of proof.

 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge in a careful and detailed decision  dismissed
    the appellant's appeal and found that the appellant  has  not  given  a
    truthful account of his financial affairs due to  the  large  financial
    discrepancies  found  in  his  evidence  and  his   explanations   were
    thoroughly unconvincing. The  Judge  made  a  clear  finding  that  the
    appellant was involved in a deliberate attempt to deceive  agencies  of
    the HM Government. The Judge was entitled to find on the evidence  that
    the respondent had satisfied his burden of proof and now  it  was  upon
    the appellant to explain the discrepancies in his evidence.  The  Judge
    was satisfied that his was a deliberate deception.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge  followed  the  reasoning  of  the  upper
    Tribunal in the case of R (on the application of Khan) of the Secretary
    of State for the Home Department (dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322
    (5) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC) when assessing whether  the  appellant  was
    dishonest in relation to his dealings UKVI or HMRC even if he  did  not
    specifically refer to that case.

 6. The Judge did consider this appeal within the guidance  given  in  Khan
    which was whether the appellant's explanation  for  the  error  of  not
    declaring his earnings was plausible, whether any documents  which  can
    be assumed  to  exist  such  as  correspondence  between  him  and  his
    accountant at the time of the tax return has been  disclosed.  He  also
    had to assess whether there is a plausible  explanation  for  why  such
    documentation is missing. The Judge also assessed why the appellant did
    not realise the error sooner because his liability to pay tax was  less
    than he should have expected and whether at any stage have  been  taken
    steps to remedy the situation and, if so, when the steps were taken and
    the explanation for any  significant  delay.  The  Judge  followed  the
    guidance even though he did not refer to the case.

 7. The initial burden of proof is on the respondent which he satisfied  by
    producing the appellant's tax returns and there was a discrepancy as to
    how much tax he declared to the HMRC and UKVI. The  appellant  accepted
    that there had been "mistakes made" in his tax returns  but  attributed
    them to his accountant or accountants. In the case of Khan it is stated
    that where  there  is  a  significant  difference  between  the  income
    declared in the appellant's previous application for  leave  to  remain
    and the income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of State is entitled  to
    draw an inference that the applicant has been deceitful or dishonest.

 8. The Judge clearly found that the respondent had discharged  his  burden
    of proof by providing this evidence and was entitled to look  upon  the
    appellant for a plausible explanation showing  that  he  has  not  been
    dishonest or deceitful to a balance of probability. Therefore,  it  was
    for the Judge to analyse the evidence and find  whether  there  was  an
    innocent explanation for the discrepancy.

 9.  The  appellant's  explanation  which  was  considered  by  the   Judge
    essentially was that his various accountants  including  Mr  Ahmed  FSF
    accountants had made a mistake and he had accepted  responsibility  for
    providing inaccurate figures to HMRC.

10. The Judge did not accept the appellant's explanation and  gave  copious
    and  valid  reasons  for  why  he  did  not  except   the   appellant's
    explanations  and  evidence.  The  Judge  considered  the   appellant's
    evidence within the  background  of  the  appellant's  and  his  wife's
    education. He noted that the appellant has a qualification in  business
    management and his wife has an MBA and MS in management  sciences.  The
    Judge did not accept the appellant's  explanation  that  his  field  of
    business management does not cover accounts or taxation. The Judge  was
    entitled to find that anyone with this  experience  and  qualifications
    and who is running a business consultancy would have been aware  of  at
    least general concepts of taxation. The Judge did not accept  that  the
    appellant's evidence that he had left all his tax matters to  Mr  Ahmed
    which is why no tax had been paid on his self-employed income,  despite
    having accounts showing the profits. The Judge  find  it  difficult  to
    believe that a man who purports two run a business consultancy firm did
    not check  his  tax  returns  after  they  had  been  prepared  by  his
    accountant and did not question why he was not expected  to  pay  extra
    tax for three years  in  his  role  as  a  business  consultant.  These
    perfectly legitimate questions were asked of the appellant and  he  was
    not able to answer  them  satisfactorily.  The  Judge  found  that  the
    appellant was vague and evasive and not a credible witness.

11. The Judge  found  that  the  appellant's  undeclared  income  from  his
    consultancy business for three years totalled �55,191.50 which was  not
    a small amount of money and the appellant could not possibly  have  not
    noticed for three years that he was underpaying tax. The Judge  further
    noted that the  appellant's  salary  was  being  taxed  at  source  and
    therefore the only income he had to declare was  his  income  from  his
    consultancy. It must have been obvious to the appellant that he had not
    declared or paid tax on his consultancy business totalling �55,191.50.

12. The Judge  took  into  account  that  the  appellant  had  no  criminal
    convictions and a good immigration record said that in itself does  not
    mean that people do not on occasions act stupidly believing  that  they
    will not be caught this conclusion has now material error.

13. The Judge considered the letters from FSF  accountants  dated  20  June
    2016, which stated "signed on behalf for on  behalf  of  FSF  accounts"
    which states that the mistake was due to a clerical error while another
    letter dated 8 June 2016 from them stated that the mistakes  made  were
    due to the errors of a trainee who has  left  their  organisation.  The
    Judge did not find it credible that  the  errors  continued  for  three
    years and his adverse credibility finding was open for him to make.

14. The Judge considered respondent's  further  evidence  produced  at  the
    hearing that FSF accountants as an entity was not even in existence  at
    the time, as SFS was incorporated on 24  June  2013.  Furthermore,  the
    Judge noted that the  SFS's  trading  accounts  show  they  had  assets
    amounting to �2 in cash in the bank as of 2014 and again in 2015.  This
    demonstrated to the Judge that the stakes made could not have been made
    by SFS accountants as claimed by the appellant. The Judge  also  relied
    on a screen shot in a website which showed that the address  which  had
    been given for FSF accountants was in fact a guesthouse.

15. The appellant's evidence was that Mr Ahmed who worked as  a  consultant
    for a firm of accountants called Proacc but subsequently went  to  work
    SFS. They still did not explain how SFS was working on the  appellant's
    accounts when they had not even been incorporated.  He  noted  that  Mr
    Ahmed did not give evidence because the appellant claimed that  he  has
    disappeared.

16. The appellant's evidence was that SFS had an office in Dickenson  Road.
    However, SFS offices was registered at 1036  Stockport  Rd  furthermore
    the FSF registers office was at the same address as Proacc.  The  Judge
    was entitled to find that this was not credible  evidence  because  the
    appellant could not explain why their registered  office  was  also  at
    1036 Stockport Rd and not Dickenson Road as claimed by  the  appellant.
    This evidence also went to the credibility of the appellant  which  the
    Judge correctly  took  into  account  when  assessing  the  appellant's
    credibility.

17. The Judge also noted that the appellant said that FSF  were  registered
    as his agents with HMRC but the letter from the HMRC  shows  that  they
    had been registered as his agents on  8  June  2016,  after  the  first
    refusal decision on 4 June 2016 and well  after  the  "inaccurate"  tax
    returns had been filed. The Judge was entitled to find that  this  also
    goes to the credibility of the appellant's claim that he had  not  used
    deception.

18. The Judge did not accept the appellant's explanation that  he  employed
    different sets of accountants who all appear to have made mistakes. The
    Judge found  it  particularly  strange  that  the  same  trainee  or  a
    different trainee would make the same mistake for three years  running,
    particularly as the mistake favoured the appellant  on  each  occasion,
    which seems, he stated, to be more than  unfortunate  coincidence.  The
    Judge was entitled to find that this also goes to  the  credibility  of
    the appellant's claim that he has not used deception.

19. Furthermore, although the  appellant  had  said  that  the  tax  return
    mistakes had been made when he instructed Proacc accountants,  but  the
    Judge correctly noted that this clearly begs the question as to why two
    letters  had  been  received  on  FSF   letterhead   paper   who   took
    responsibility for the mistake in his account. The Judge  also  do  not
    accept the appellant's explanation that Mr Mr Ahmed had been a director
    with Proacc before moving to FSF and he moved with him  after  a  short
    hiatus. The Judge ddid not accept this explanation because Mr Ahmed  in
    his letter had not any reference to Proacc at all and the letter was on
    SFS letterhead stated that this organisation takes the blame.

20.  The  Judge  stated  that  although  the  appellant  had  requested  an
    adjournment to enable further evidence to  be  provided,  no  one  from
    Proacc gave evidence or submitted a written statement.  The  Judge  was
    entitled to question that if Proacc was responsible for the mistake  as
    the appellant claims why no evidence was provided  from  Mr  Bassit  of
    Proacc. The Judge did not accept the appellant's explanation for why no
    one came to give evidence was that Mr Bassit  told  him  that  he  will
    answer further questions if the Home Office wanted to contact him.  The
    Judge was right to ask  that  this  still  does  not  explain  why  the
    appellant did not ask anyone from that firm to give for  the  purported
    mistakes that they had made especially after adjournment had been given
    specifically for this purpose.

21. The Judge was entitled  to  find  that  if  the  accountants  had  made
    mistakes which has prejudiced the appellant it is not credible that  he
    had  not  made  any  complaints  on  any  of  his  accountants  to  the
    appropriate regulatory bodies despite the mistakes that  they  accepted
    they had made. The  Judge  was  entitled  to  find  that  this  is  not
    credible.

22. There were other credibility issues that the Judge  took  into  account
    such as why the appellant engaged a number  of  accountants  and  noted
    that the appellant's self-employment business accounts submitted to the
    respondent in his  2011  application  was  prepared  by  Ashton  Cooper
    accountants who appear  to  set  out  the  information  needed  by  the
    respondent correctly and yet this firm did not submit a tax return. The
    Judge did not accept the appellant's explanation and gave good  reasons
    in his decision.

23. The appellant submits  that  the  HMRC  has  been  satisfied  with  the
    explanation he has provided them. The judge was entitled to  find  that
    the view of the HMRC is neither  here  or  there  as  set  out  in  the
    decision of the Upper Tribunal the judicial review case of  R  (on  the
    application of Samat) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2017] UKAIT JR and Abbasi  JR/13807/2016  where  there  were  findings
    relating to the relevance of the actions  that  HMRC  makes  against  a
    person. It states that there are several reasons  why  HMRC  would  not
    take action against a particular person  and  that  should  not  go  in
    favour of the appellant. Therefore, the treatment of applicants by HMRC
    is not relevant to 322 (5) assessments.

24. The Judge was aware  that  the  finding  of  deceit  and  dishonest  in
    relation to a person's tax affairs is a serious  finding  with  serious
    consequences. The Judge considered all the evidence extremely carefully
    and on the evidence in this appeal his was  the  only  conclusion  that
    could possibly have been reached. To have found  otherwise  would  have
    been a material error of law.

25. The Judge made clear findings to the relevant burden of proof  and  the
    evidence which  he  relied  upon  for  his  findings  were  made  world
    unequivocal and his reasoning is beyond reproach. There is no error  of
    law in the decision, material or otherwise.

26. In respect of Article 8 the Judge considered all the evidence including
    the welfare of the appellant's children. The Judge was  bound  to  take
    into account in his balancing exercise the provisions of section 117 of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and was satisfied that
    the appellant and his children enjoy a family life together and that it
    is proportionate for them to return to Pakistan as a family unit.

27. The Judge made reference  to  s55  of  the  Boarders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act 2009 and had regard to the welfare of  the  appellant's
    children as a primary, albeit not a paramount consideration  which  was
    the appropriate guidance that he gave himself. The Judge noted that the
    appellant and his wife's private life was built in  this  country  when
    their immigration status was precarious.

28. The Judge considered the evidence that the appellant has  been  in  the
    United Kingdom for 12 years and his wife for four years. The Judge made
    the relevant analysis and  enquiry  in  respect  of  the  children  and
    whether they will be looked after in Pakistan by their parents on their
    return. He found that both appellants speak English to a good  standard
    and there is no evidence that they will not be able to earn  an  income
    in Pakistan and look after their family. The judge also found that  the
    children have family in Pakistan as the appellants parents  live  there
    whom they have visited them on a regular basis. The  Judge  found  that
    the children will be looked after by their parents  in  Pakistan  which
    was a conclusion open to him on the evidence. The Judge also noted that
    they are Pakistan nationals who can return to their own country.

29. In respect one of the children the Judge took into account  the  report
    of an educational psychologist of November  2017  where  reference  was
    made that the child is  on  the  autistic's  spectrum  presenting  with
    complex social needs. The Judge stated in his decision that the  second
    appellant's family have speech difficulties and also live  in  Pakistan
    and therefore would be able to support  the  appellants  in  supporting
    their child with autism. He also considered that the  other  child  has
    Syndactyly on his toes. The  Judge  was  fully  aware  of  the  medical
    conditions of children.

30. However, the Judge considered the objective evidence of  the  treatment
    of people with disabilities in Pakistan and stated  that  there  is  no
    evidence before him that there are no healthcare facilities  for  those
    with disabilities. This was in fact not an issue and  it  was  accepted
    that treatment for this condition is available in Pakistan.  The  Judge
    found that appellant's autistic child has his parents who are concerned
    and committed and who are aware of these possible issues that may arise
    and have the education to  be  able  to  access  appropriate  help  and
    support for this child. These conclusions were open to the Judge on the
    evidence there is no material error of law.

31.  The  Judge  was  entitled  to  find  that  the  respondent's  goal  of
    maintenance of effective immigration control is clearly in  the  public
    interest in this case.

32. The grounds of appeal are no more than a quarrel with the  findings  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge who by all accounts  has  considered  all
    the evidence  carefully  and  did  not  fall  into  material  error.  I
    therefore uphold the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.
