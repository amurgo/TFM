Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Solomon of IAS Limited


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal is subject to an anonymity order  made  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal pursuant to  rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
    Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230).  Neither  party  invited
    me to rescind the order and I continue it pursuant to rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698).

 2. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Holder and Mr D R Bremmer JP) which  allowed
    MCP's appeal against the Secretary  of  State's  decision  made  on  26
    September 2012 that s.32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 ("the 2007 Act")
    applied.  On 24 January 2013, the Secretary of State made a deportation
    order by virtue of the provisions to the 2007 Act.

 3. For convenience, I shall refer to the parties as they  appeared  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.

The Background

 4. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on  5  December  1999  with
    leave to enter as a visitor valid until 31 December 1999.   Thereafter,
    his leave was extended as a student until 30 May 2002.   In  June  2002
    the appellant made an application to remain as the partner of a British
    citizen ("CW") with whom he has one child ("JP") who was born in  2002.
    The application  was  refused  in  September  2004  and  the  appellant
    subsequently withdrew his appeal.  That relationship had broken down in
    2003 or early 2004.  On 11 September 2004 he married a British  citizen
    ("AE") and they have two children, ("DJP"  and  "DMP")  who  were  born
    respectively in January 2004 and November 2004.  That marriage ended in
    divorce on 12 October 2006.

 5. On 23 July 2007 the appellant was removed to Jamaica.  He  subsequently
    applied for entry clearance but that was refused and subsequent appeals
    dismissed.  On 2 January 2008, a contact order was made by the  Bristol
    County Court in favour of the appellant in respect of his son  JP.   On
    22 January 2008, the appellant made an application for entry  clearance
    in order to exercise his contact rights.  A visa was issued on 9  April
    2008 and, shortly thereafter, the appellant returned to the UK.  On  24
    February 2009, the appellant applied for indefinite leave to remain  as
    the parent of a child settled in the UK and that leave was  granted  on
    20 October 2010.

 6. In about May 2004, the  appellant  had  begun  a  relationship  with  a
    British citizen ("BA").  They have  two  children  together  ("MP"  and
    "LP") born respectively in 2005 and 2009.  The appellant and BA married
    on 18 April 2012.

 7. In addition to the five  children  I  have  already  referred  to,  the
    appellant has two other children.  His eldest child, ("AP") was born in
    1995 in Jamaica.  He has lived in the UK since 2002.  He is a  Jamaican
    citizen.  The appellant's other child, ("TAP") was born in  2007.   Her
    mother is a British citizen  and  the  birth  resulted  from  a  casual
    relationship.

 8. In total, therefore, the appellant has seven children in the UK.   They
    are, in chronological order, AP who is 18 and a  Jamaican  citizen;  TP
    who is 11; DJP who is 9 and will shortly be 10; DMP who is 9; MP who is
    8 and will shortly be 9; TAP who is 6 and LP who is 4.  All apart  from
    AP are British citizens, as are their mothers.

 9. On 6 October 2011, the appellant pleaded guilty at  the  Bristol  Crown
    Court to two counts  of  possession  with  intent  to  supply  class  A
    controlled drugs, namely cocaine and heroin.  On 23 March 2012, he  was
    sentenced to a total of 21 months' imprisonment in  relation  to  these
    offences.  It was as a result of these convictions that  the  Secretary
    of State made a decision that the provisions of the  2007  Act  applied
    and which is the subject of this appeal.

10. Following the Secretary of State's decision on 26 September  2012,  the
    appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  He relied both upon the
    Immigration Rules namely paras 397-399, and Art 8  of  the  ECHR.   The
    First-tier  Tribunal  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal   under   the
    Immigration Rules and no challenge to that decision has been made.   In
    relation to Art 8, the appellant relied upon his "family life" with his
    current wife, BA, and his children in the UK.  The First-tier  Tribunal
    accepted that he had a genuine and subsisting relationship with five of
    his children and, as he had no contact with the two children  (DJP  and
    DMP) born to his ex-wife AE, the First-tier Tribunal accepted that  his
    family life was only with his five other children and  his  wife.   The
    First-tier Tribunal concluded that  it  was  in  his  children's  "best
    interests" that he should remain in the UK to maintain his family  life
    with them and the First-tier Tribunal concluded  that  the  appellant's
    deportation would be a disproportionate interference  with  the  family
    life between him and his wife and children.  Consequently,  the  First-
    tier Tribunal allowed the appellant's appeal under Art 8.

11. The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal.  On 2 July  2012
    the First-tier Tribunal (DJ Appleyard) granted the appellant permission
    to appeal.  The appeal initially came before me on 7 October 2013.   In
    a decision dated 10 October  2013,  I  concluded  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had erred in law in allowing the appellant's appeal under  Art
    8 on the basis that it had failed properly to carry out  the  balancing
    exercise  taking  into  account  the  seriousness  of  the  appellant's
    offending and had failed to give adequate reasons for its finding  that
    the appellant's deportation  would  be  disproportionate.   It  is  not
    necessary to repeat those reasons here which are fully set  out  in  my
    earlier decision.

12. The appeal was adjourned for a resumed hearing which was listed  before
    me on 27 November 2013.

The Hearing

13. Ms Solomon, who represented the appellant, indicated that she  did  not
    propose to call any oral evidence.  Without objection from Mr Richards,
    I admitted under rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698) updating statements from  the  appellant  and
    his wife BP dated 27 November 2013.  Mr Richards indicated that he  did
    not wish to cross-examine the appellant.  In addition, Ms  Solomon  put
    before me an email and a letter dated 24 October 2013 from Ms  Adie,  a
    Probation Service Officer.  The e-mail indicated that  the  appellant's
    licence would end on 22 December 2013 and that he was not  expected  to
    attend for any further supervision  appointments  following  his  final
    supervision appointment on 26 November 2013.  The  letter  points  out,
    inter alia, that the appellant is assessed as having a "low risk of re-
    offending" and, given the length of time since his conviction, his "his
    risk of serious harm is currently assessed as low".

14. I heard oral submissions from both Ms Solomon and Mr  Richards  and  Ms
    Solomon also relied on her skeleton argument.

15. It was common ground before me that the First-tier  Tribunal's  factual
    findings stood.  The central issue  for  me,  on  the  basis  of  those
    findings, was to determine  whether  the  appellant's  deportation  was
    proportionate for the purposes of Art 8.2 of the ECHR.

16. Put succinctly, the parties' submissions amounted to this.  Ms  Solomon
    submitted that  the  interference  with  the  family  life  established
    between the appellant and his wife and children (which would inevitably
    be disrupted by  his  deportation  as  they  could  not  reasonably  be
    expected to live with him in Jamaica) and given  that  it  was  in  his
    children's best interests that he should remain in the UK with them  as
    a family unit, were not outweighed by the legitimate aim of  preventing
    disorder or crime, even taking into  account  the  seriousness  of  the
    appellant's offence but having regard  to  the  fact  that  he  had  no
    history of offences of this nature and he only posed a low risk of  re-
    offending and had, indeed, not committed any offences since his release
    on 15 February 2013.

17. Mr Richards submitted that despite the favourable findings by the First-
    tier Tribunal in respect of the appellant's family life with  his  wife
    and children and their best interests, this was  an  extremely  serious
    offence involving the supply of cocaine and heroin with a street  value
    of �14,000 and the legitimate aim  of  preventing  disorder  and  crime
    outweighed any interference with the family life of the appellant,  his
    wife and children.

Discussion and Findings

18. At the outset, I set out a number of factual matters  accepted  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal and not now challenged:

      i) The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica who first came to the  UK  in
         1999.  Apart from a period between July 2007 and April  2008  (when
         he had been removed to Jamaica) the appellant has  resided  in  the
         UK;

     ii) The appellant had valid leave until  30  May  2002  but  thereafter
         remained in the UK without leave until he was removed  on  23  July
         2007.  Between April 2008 and October 2010 the appellant had  leave
         to remain in the UK and on 20 October 2010 was  granted  indefinite
         leave to remain in the UK;

    iii) The appellant married BP in April 2011 although they had known  one
         another since May 2004.  Their relationship  broke  down  in  early
         2004 but was later re-kindled and they started living  together  in
         April 2011.   They  now  live  together  and  have  a  genuine  and
         subsisting relationship as husband and wife;

     iv) The appellant has seven children living in the UK.  All except  the
         eldest (AP) are British citizens.  AP is 18 and his other  children
         are aged between 11 and 4. AP has lived with his "aunt" since  2002
         and is studying to be a hairdresser.

      v) The appellant lives with his two younger children (their mother  is
         his wife), namely MP and LP who are 8 and 4 years old respectively;

     vi) The appellant has a genuine parental relationship with five of  his
         seven children in the UK, namely AP,  JP  (in  respect  of  whom  a
         contact order is in force), MP, TAP and LP;

    vii) The relationship between the appellant and his wife and between the
         appellant and his five children amounts  to  family  life  for  the
         purposes of Art 8 of the ECHR;

   viii) It would not be reasonable to expect the appellant's  wife,  BP  or
         any of his children to live in Jamaica if he is deported;

     ix) None of the appellant's children (including AP) have any meaningful
         ties with Jamaica;

      x) The appellant's ties to Jamaica are "limited" where  the  prospects
         are not good for him to obtain work and accommodation and he has no
         family who can provide any significant help;

     xi) The best interests  of  the  appellant's  five  children  can  only
         satisfactorily be met by the appellant remaining in the UK with his
         children and wife in order that family life can continue.

19. In addition, the First-tier Tribunal  made  a  number  of  findings  in
    relation to  the  appellant's  offence  and  offending  which  are  not
    disputed as follows:

      i) The risk of the appellant re-offending is "low";

     ii) The appellant is genuinely remorseful;

    iii) The appellant has not re-offended since  his  release  in  February
         2013 and has been a "well-behaved and  law-abiding"  citizen  since
         his release;

     iv) The appellant has  not  previously  been  convicted  of  any  drugs
         related offending although he has committed offences under the Road
         Traffic Act 1988.

20. In addition to those findings, the additional evidence put before me at
    the hearing establishes the following:

      i) The appellant's tag and curfew were withdrawn in July 2013;

     ii) The close relationship between the appellant and his  children  and
         with his wife continues;

    iii) In the most recent assessment by  the  Probation  Service  (in  its
         letter dated 24 October 2013) the appellant poses a "low"  risk  to
         the public provided that he does not associate with those  involved
         in the supply of illegal drugs.

     iv) The appellant's wife, BP was not aware of the  appellant's  offence
         until he was arrested.

21. In applying Art 8, I adopt the well-known five-stage  approach  as  set
    out by the House of Lords in Razgar [2004] UKHL  27  at  [17]  by  Lord
    Bingham of Cornhill:

    (a)  Will the proposed removal be an interference by a public authority
         with the exercise of the  applicant's  right  to  respect  for  his
         private or (as the case may be) family life?

         The  answer  to  that  question  is  'yes'.   The   appellant   has
         established family life with his wife with whom he is in a  genuine
         relationship and with his five children, two of whom live with  him
         and his wife (their mother).

    (b)  If so, will such interference have consequences of such gravity as
         potentially to engage the operation of Art 8?

         The answer is again 'yes'.  The effect of deportation  will  be  to
         split the appellant's family such that  the  appellant's  wife  and
         children, who cannot reasonably be expected  to  accompany  him  to
         Jamaica, will live in the UK whilst he lives in Jamaica.  Normally,
         a deportation order in the circumstances of  this  appellant  would
         prevent  his  exclusion  for  ten  years  (see  para  391  of   the
         Immigration  Rules).   The  First-tier  Tribunal  found  that   the
         appellant's family life could not continue "in any meaningful  way"
         if he was deported (see para [69] of the determination).

    (c)  If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?

         The answer is again 'yes'.  The deportation would, subject  to  Art
         8, be in accordance with the Immigration Rules and the 2007 Act.

    (d)  Is any such interference for a legitimate aim as set  out  in  Art
         8.2?

         The answer is again 'yes'.  The appellant's deportation is "for the
         prevention of crime or disorder".

    (e)  Is any such  interference  proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim
         sought to be achieved?

         As I pointed out above, it was common ground at  the  hearing  that
         this was the crucial issue in the appeal.

22.  In  Razgar  at  [20]  Lord  Bingham  identified  that  the  issue   of
    "proportionality":

         "involves the striking of a fair balance between the rights of  the
         individual and the interests of the community which is inherent  in
         the whole of the Convention."

23. Carrying out that balancing  exercise,  the  "best  interests"  of  any
    children is a primary consideration although  it  is  not  a  paramount
    consideration.  In ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4, Lady Hale stated
    at [33]:

         "In making the proportionality assessment under  Art  8,  the  best
         interests of the child must be a primary consideration.  This means
         that they must be  considered  first.   They  can,  of  course,  be
         outweighed by the cumulative effect of other considerations."

24. It follows that the "best interests" of a child may  be  outweighed  by
    the cumulative effect of other  considerations,  including  the  public
    interest, but that "no other consideration can be treated as inherently
    more significant" (see Zoumbas v SSHD [2013] UKSC  74  at  [10(3)]  per
    Lord Hodge).

25. In this appeal, the focus of the public  interest  is  the  appellant's
    offending.  In OH (Serbia) v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 694, Wilson LJ (as he
    then was) summarised the three facets of the public interest which  had
    to be considered in deportation cases as follows (at [13]):

      a) The risk of re-offending by the person concerned;


      b) The need to deter foreign nationals from committing serious
         offences by leading them to understand that, whatever the other
         circumstances, one certain consequence of that may well be
         deportation; and


      c) The role of deportation as an expression of society's revulsion at
         serious crimes and in building public confidence in the treatment
         of foreign citizens who have committed serious offences.

26. Those three facets are equally applicable in an  automatic  deportation
    case such as the present (see RU (Bangladesh) v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ  6
    and AM v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 1634).  In SS (Nigeria v SSHD [2013] EWCA
    Civ 550, the Court of Appeal emphasised that in  automatic  deportation
    appeals, the 2007 Act set a legislative policy that the deportation  of
    a  "foreign  criminal"  such  as  the  appellant  was  in  the  'public
    interest'.  Laws LJ at [54] concluded:

         "The pressing  nature  of  the  public  interest  here  is  vividly
         informed by the fact that by parliament's express  declaration  the
         public interest is injured if the  criminal's  deportation  is  not
         effected.  Such a result could in my judgment only be justified  by
         a very strong claim indeed."

27. With those matters well in mind, I set out the  factors  recognised  in
    the settled jurisprudence of the Strasbourg  Court  to  be  taken  into
    account in assessing the proportionality of an individual  deportation.
    The "Boultif criteria" (as they are known) are conveniently set out  in
    the Grand Chamber's decision in �ner  v  Netherlands  (Application  no.
    46410/99) [2007] Imm AR 303 at [57] and [58] as follows:

         "(a) The nature and seriousness of the  offence  committed  by  the
         appellant;

      b) The length of the appellant's stay in the United Kingdom;

          c) The time elapse  since  the  offence  was  committed  and  the
             appellant's conduct during that period;

          d) The nationalities of the various persons concerned;

          e) The appellant's family situation, such as the  length  of  the
             marriage, and other factors expressing the effectiveness of  a
             couple's family life;

          f) Whether the spouse knew about the offence at the time when  he
             or she entered into a family relationship;

          g) Whether there are children of the family,  and  if  so,  their
             age;

          h) The seriousness of the difficulties which the spouse is likely
             to encounter in Jamaica (the country to which the appellant is
             to be expelled);

          i)  The  best  interests  and  well-being  of  the  children,  in
             particular the  seriousness  of  the  difficulties  which  any
             children of the appellant are likely to encounter in  Jamaica,
             the country to which the appellant is to be expelled; and

          j) The solidarity of social, cultural and family  ties  with  the
             host country and with the country of destination."

28. I deal first with the factors concerning the appellant and his family's
    circumstances.  First, the appellant has been  in  the  United  Kingdom
    since December 1999 with the exception of a period  between  July  2007
    when he was removed to Jamaica and April 2008  when  he  returned  with
    entry clearance to exercise contact rights with his son  JP.   He  has,
    therefore, been in the UK initially for seven  and  a  half  years  and
    latterly for five and a half years making a total of 13 years.  He  was
    17 when he first came to the UK and is now a few  weeks  short  of  his
    41st birthday.

29. Secondly, although the appellant is Jamaican, his wife and four of  his
    five children with whom he has family life are British  citizens.   His
    children with his wife (with whom he lives)  are  4  and  8  years  old
    respectively.  He also has family life with a daughter (TAP) aged 6,  a
    son (TP) aged 11 and his (now adult) son (AP) aged 18.

30. Thirdly, the depth and richness of the family life that  the  appellant
    has with his wife and children is described by the First-tier  Tribunal
    as being a "close and genuine bond".  The evidence  amply  demonstrates
    that the  appellant  is  fully  involved  with  his  children  and,  in
    particular, plays a full part  in  raising  the  two  children  of  his
    current marriage with whom he lives.  At para  4  of  his  most  recent
    statement, the appellant says:

         "My bond with my children is greater than ever, they are  extremely
         happy to have me home and see my face in  the  audience  at  school
         shows.  Being home I was able to take my son [JP] to his first  day
         at secondary school and my youngest daughter [LP] to her first  day
         at pre-school.  I continue to attend  all  of  their  appointments,
         meetings and school activities."

31. The evidence of BP, the appellant's wife, is to like effect.  The First-
    tier Tribunal referred to a letter from the head teacher of the  school
    where  two  of  the  appellant's  children  study  (at  para  [23])  as
    describing the appellant "as a caring parent showing  concern  for  his
    children and engaging with the school".  The head teacher is quoted  as
    saying: "I know his children adore him and he  really  cares  for  them
    emotionally and physically".

32. As I have already stated, the First-tier Tribunal made  the  clear  and
    unequivocal finding that the "best interests" of the  appellant's  five
    children could: "only be satisfactorily met by  him  remaining  in  the
    United Kingdom with his children and wife in  order  that  family  life
    continues." (at [69] of the determination).

33. Fourthly, the First-tier Tribunal found that it would not be reasonable
    to expect the appellant's wife or any of his children to return to live
    with him in Jamaica.  That finding was, frankly, inevitable  given  the
    fact that (apart from AP) they are all British citizens who have  lived
    their entire lives in the UK.  Leaving aside AP, the children (and as a
    consequence their respective mothers) could not be expected  to  uproot
    themselves and live outside the EU (in particular the UK)  (Sanade  and
    Others (British children - Zambrano - Dereci) [2012] UKUT 00048 (IAC)).

34. Fifthly, as the First-tier Tribunal found,  the  appellant's  wife  and
    children only had ties in the UK and his eldest son (though  Jamaican),
    who has lived in the UK  since  2002  and  is  currently  studying  and
    training to be a hairdresser, had "no meaningful ties" to Jamaica.  The
    appellant's ties to Jamaica were found by the First-tier Tribunal to be
    "limited" and the prospects of him  obtaining  work  and  accommodation
    were "not good" and further he did not have any family in  Jamaica  who
    could  provide  any  significant   help   (see   para   [49]   of   the
    determination).

35. Sixthly, in my view the lives not only of the appellant's wife and  his
    children are solidly rigid in the UK but so also is  the  life  of  the
    appellant himself.  The appellant left Jamaica when he was 17  and,  on
    his evidence, he was abandoned by his parents at the age of 10 to  grow
    up on the streets.  He has had ILR since October 2010.

36. Turning now to the nature and seriousness of the  appellant's  offence,
    there is no doubt that the appellant was convicted of  a  most  serious
    offence, namely possession with intent to supply a significant quantity
    of class A drugs, namely cocaine and heroin  with  a  street  value  of
    �14,000.  The seriousness of that offence is not mitigated by the  fact
    that he was not directly dealing  with  the  public.   He  acted  as  a
    custodian for another but was, nevertheless, an essential link  in  the
    chain  of  distribution  of  class  A  drugs.   He  was  sentenced   to
    imprisonment for 21 months having been  given  the  maximum  credit  (a
    third) for his guilty plea.  In her sentencing remarks, the Crown Court
    judge recognised that the nature of the appellant's  offence  was  such
    that an immediate term  of  imprisonment  was  inevitable.   The  judge
    recognised that the appellant was "effectively" of good  character  and
    that he was, on the  references  she  had  read,  "a  very  caring  and
    committed individual".

37. As I have said, the appellant's offence was  of  a  most  serious  kind
    involving him (as part of the distribution  chain)  in  the  supply  of
    class A drugs to the public.  This offence engages all three facets  of
    the public interest, namely the need to deter other  foreign  nationals
    from committing similar offences;  and  the  importance  of  expressing
    society's revulsion at such a serious crime which, in its  end  result,
    does, as Mr Richards put it in his submissions,  have  a  "catastrophic
    effect" on society.  As regards re-offending, the finding of the First-
    tier Tribunal is that there is  a  "low"  risk  of  the  appellant  re-
    offending.  That is further borne out in the letter from the  Probation
    Service dated 24 October 2013.  The First-tier Tribunal also found that
    the appellant was now genuinely remorseful that he  had  committed  the
    offence.  He has  not  committed  any  further  offence  since  he  was
    released from custody in February 2011 and,  perhaps  more  importantly
    for this point, has been without a tag or not subject to a curfew since
    July.  The appellant has not been "tempted" to commit further  offences
    despite  the  fact  that,  as  he  cannot  currently  work  given   his
    immigration status, he and his wife have had to go into debt  in  order
    to meet their needs, including  paying  legal  fees.   The  appellant's
    continued good behaviour bodes well for the future.

38. In carrying out the balancing exercise, this is a  case  where  if  the
    appellant is deported, inevitably  the  substance  of  the  appellant's
    family life with his wife and children will for the foreseeable  future
    (probably for at least ten years) come to an end.  That, as the  First-
    tier Tribunal found, is not in the "best interests"  of  his  children.
    They will be deprived of the support and continued care  and  attention
    of the appellant who is, all the evidence shows, a loving father.   The
    appellant's wife gives an illustration of the impact of separation from
    the appellant when she states in para  7  of  her  statement  dated  27
    November 2013 that as a result of the appellant  being  in  prison,  at
    night her children wet the bed and talked about him in their sleep.

39. In this appeal, to paraphrase the words of Lord Bingham in SSHD v Huang
    [2007] UKHL 11 at [20], the ultimate question that I have to address in
    the  circumstances  of  this  appeal  where  the  family  life  of  the
    appellant's  family  cannot  reasonably  be  expected  to  be   enjoyed
    elsewhere  is  whether  "taking  full  account  of  all  considerations
    weighing  in  favour  of  the  refusal"  the  appellant's   deportation
    "prejudices the family life of [the appellant] in a manner sufficiently
    serious to amount to a breach of the fundamental  rights  protected  by
    Article 8."

40. I bear in mind that the children's "best interests" -  which  are  that
    the appellant should remain in the  UK  with  them  -  are  a  "primary
    consideration".  I bear in mind that those  "best  interests"  will  be
    entirely  thwarted  by  the  appellant's  deportation.   Likewise   the
    appellant's married life will, in substance, cease.  The impact of  the
    appellant's deportation will be felt by five children, four of whom are
    between the ages of 4 and 11 and will, therefore, lose the  support  of
    their father as a parent for a significant period  of  their  childhood
    and development towards adulthood.  Against that,  I  take  fully  into
    account that the appellant has been convicted of a most serious offence
    of dealing in class A drugs.  It was his first and only  such  offence.
    To all intents and purposes, he was previously a man of good character.
     The genuineness of his remorse for his offending was recognised by the
    First-tier Tribunal, which heard the oral evidence,  in  its  findings.
    The lives of all the relevant  parties  are  rooted  in  the  UK.   The
    appellant has lived in the UK for some twelve years in total.   Subject
    to his deportation, the appellant has indefinite leave to remain in the
    UK which was granted in October 2010.  The  evidence  posits  that  the
    appellant is a "low" risk of re-offending  and  since  his  release  in
    February  2013,  even  in  the  face  of  financial  difficulties,  the
    appellant has not re-offended.  It seems likely that the appellant  has
    seen the error of his ways and the importance of his family life  given
    that his offending has put that family life at risk.

41. I remind myself of what the Supreme Court said in Zoumbas that:

         "Although the best interests of a child can be  outweighed  by  the
         cumulative effect of other considerations, no  other  consideration
         can be treated as inherently more significant" (at [10(3)]).

42. The strength of the appellant's family life both with his wife and five
    children and the effect upon it if he is deported, to use the words  of
    Laws LJ in SS (Nigeria) at [54], amounts to a "very strong claim".  The
    strength of that claim drives me to conclude that, having regard to all
    the circumstances and taking the "best interests"  of  the  appellant's
    children as a primary consideration, despite the weight that the public
    interest rightly deserves when a "foreign criminal" commits a crime  of
    this nature, the interference with the family life  of  the  appellant,
    his wife and children outweighs  the  public  interest  such  that  the
    appellant's deportation has not been demonstrated to be  proportionate.
    In my judgment, the appellant's deportation would breach Art 8  of  the
    ECHR.

Decision

43. For the reasons given in my decision dated 10 October 2013, the  First-
    tier Tribunal's decision to allow the appellant's appeal  under  Art  8
    involved the making of an error of law and it is set aside.

44. I remake the decision allowing the appellant's appeal under Art 8.
