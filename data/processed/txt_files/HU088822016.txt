Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Khan, Khirri Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. At the end of the hearing on 8 October 2018,  I  informed  the  parties
    that although I found there was procedural unfairness in  the  handling
    of the appellant's case before the First-tier  Tribunal,  and  although
    such unfairness amounted to a legal error, on the facts of the case  it
    could not be a material error, and therefore I would not set aside  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Lodge that was issued on 26 April
    2017.

 2. To understand  the  procedural  unfairness  argument,  I  set  out  the
    following events, which I have drawn from the evidence and submissions.

|12 April 2017 |Appellant instructs Khirri Solicitors that she will be  |
|              |unable to attend the appeal hearing on 19 April 2017    |
|              |because of medical complication arising from her        |
|              |pregnancy.                                              |
|19 April 2017 |Mr Khan, representing the appellant before Judge Lodge, |
|              |requests an adjournment because of the appellant's ill  |
|              |health; or in the alternative, time to supply medical   |
|              |evidence to confirm her infirmities.                    |
|22 April 2017 |Judge Lodge dates his written decision and reasons      |
|              |statement and submits it for promulgation.              |
|24 April 2017 |Khirri Solicitors supply the Tribunal with medical      |
|              |evidence that states the appellant, "was unfit to attend|
|              |court on the 19-4-17" but the Tribunal takes no action. |
|26 April 2017 |Judge Lodge's decision and reasons statement is         |
|              |promulgated                                             |


 3. Mr Khan and Mr Whitwell agree that the failure of the Tribunal  to  act
    on the medical evidence is a procedural error that amounts to an  error
    of law because Judge lodge remained seized  of  the  appeal  until  his
    decision and reasons statement was issued.  Although he was required to
    consider that evidence and to decide whether in all  the  circumstances
    it remained appropriate to have  proceeded  with  the  hearing  in  the
    absence of the appellant the application  of  24  April  2017  was  not
    passed to him and he could neither review his decision nor make further
    assessment of what might or might not be in the interests of justice.

 4. Without that consideration, it cannot be said  that  the  Tribunal  had
    proper regard to the provisions in rule 28 of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Procedure Rules as to when the Tribunal might proceed with a hearing in
    the absence of a party.  Although it was clear that the  appellant  had
    been notified of the hearing, it was unclear whether it remained in the
    interests of justice to proceed  without  the  appellant.   It  is  the
    failure to consider whether it remained in the interests of justice  to
    proceed in absence of the appellant that makes the procedural  error  a
    legal error.

 5. Turning to the second issue, whether the error of law  is  such  as  to
    require me to set aside Judge Lodge's decision, after discussion  on  8
    October 2018, Mr Khan and Mr Whitwell agreed that the  outcome  of  the
    appeal could be no different even if the appeal were  remitted  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing.

 6. The appellant wished to rely  on  new  matters,  namely  the  fact  her
    children might be able to acquire British citizenship  if  her  husband
    was granted indefinite leave to remain, which would  bring  her  within
    paragraph EX.1 of appendix FM to the immigration rules and would reduce
    the public interest in refusing leave to remain because of s.117B(6) of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  It was only on these
    issues that she wished to give evidence.

 7. However, under s.85  of  the  2002  Act,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
    prevented from considering such issues unless the  Secretary  of  State
    gives consent because they are new matters.  This has been confirmed by
    the  Upper  Tribunal  in   cases   such   as   Quaidoo   (new   matter:
    procedure/process) Ghana [2018] UKUT 87 and Mahmud (S. 85 NIAA  2002  -
    'new matters': Iran) [2017] UKUT 488.   Home  Office  policy  indicates
    that consent will not be given in the circumstances of this  appeal,  a
    position confirmed by Mr Whitwell and acknowledged by Mr Khan.

 8. Therefore, the issues the appellant seeks to pursue in this appeal  are
    ones that cannot be pursued.  The findings made  by  Judge  Lodge  from
    [15] to [22] are sound  and  no  other  findings  could  be  made.   He
    properly considered the circumstances at the  date  of  hearing.   This
    conclusion is reinforced by the failure of the appellant to provide  an
    appeal bundle for the hearing in the First-tier Tribunal or since.  The
    appellant was hoping that events that were yet to happen might be taken
    into consideration by the judge but that is not  possible  given  Judge
    Lodge had to consider her circumstances at the date of hearing  and  in
    light of the reasons for refusal.  This is not to  suggest  that  Judge
    Lodge  ignored  the  possible  future  changes   to   the   appellant's
    circumstances.  He considered  those  arguments  that  [23]  and  [24],
    reminding himself that he had to consider the appellant's circumstances
    at the date of hearing.

 9. Mr Khan has not suggested there was or is any documentary  evidence  on
    which the appellant could rely in relation to future  events.  Nor  was
    there any oral evidence to be given that would change the facts  as  at
    the date of hearing.

10. In these circumstances, I am satisfied the appellant's absence from the
    hearing did not deprive her of a fair hearing given the facts  as  they
    were and the restrictions on new matters.  For this reason, I find  the
    legal error was not material.

Notice of Decision

Although there is legal error in  the  decision  and  reasons  statement  of
First-tier Tribunal Judge Lodge that was issued on 26 April 2017, the  error
is not such as to require me to set his decision aside.

Therefore, the appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed and  I  uphold  the
decision of Judge Lodge.
