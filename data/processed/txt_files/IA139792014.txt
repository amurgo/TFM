Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Ross of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Office


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of  the  United  States  and  born  on  18th
    December 1989 and on 21st January 2014 she made a combined  application
    for further leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant and
    for a biometric resident permit.  She had previously been granted leave
    on 20th September to enter the UK as a student until 23rd January 2014.

The Refusal Decision

 2. The application was refused on 6th March 2014 under paragraph 245HD  of
    the Immigration Rules as the appellant did not meet the requirement  at
    paragraph 245HD(f) and under Appendix A with reference to  Appendix  J.
    The appellant  was  required  to  score  50  points  under  Appendix  A
    (attributes) (which includes 30 points for sponsorship  and  20  points
    for appropriate salary) and to provide the specified documents.

 3. The salary included on her certificate of sponsorship was  not  at  the
    appropriate rate for the job as  specified  under  Appendix  A  of  the
    Immigration Rules and the Codes of Practice specified at Appendix J  of
    the Immigration Rules.

 4. Her certificate of sponsorship stated that her  prospective  employment
    most closely corresponded to occupation 2429 on the Codes  of  Practice
    under Appendix J.

 5. From 6th April 2013 a new policy on rates of pay for "new entrants  and
    experienced workers" within the Codes of Practice was introduced.

 6. The minimum acceptable rate of pay for a 39 hour working week  for  the
    prospective employment for the  appellant  was  �22,500  per  annum  as
    stated on occupation code 2429 under the new entrant appropriate salary
    rate.

 7. The certificate of sponsorship stated that her salary would be  �21,000
    per annum for a 40 hour week which equated to �20,475 per annum  for  a
    39 hour week.

 8. As her prospective  salary  was  not  at  the  above  minimum  rate  as
    specified in the Codes of Practice SOC2010 under the new entrant  level
    she did not meet any exceptions as  specified  in  Appendix  O  of  the
    Immigration Rules and it was not considered to be an  appropriate  rate
    for the job.

 9. Therefore no points had been awarded for an appropriate salary and  the
    appeal was refused.

10. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Kempton  considered  the  letter  from  the
    appellant's  employer  Caxton  dated  20th  March  2014  stating   that
    discretion ought to have been exercised differently as  the  difference
    in salary was very slight.  The salary was set out in the contract with
    that which the company believed to be a minimum for a Tier 2 worker  on
    UKBA website being �20,300.  This mistake had been  rectified  and  the
    salary was now increased to the appropriate level  of  �23,250.   Judge
    Kempton extracted from the website an updated page  as  at  10th  April
    2014 and this detailed that the occupation code 2429 identified  a  new
    entrant's appropriate salary of �20,400.





11. He stated at paragraph 9:

         "It does appear that there is quite a bit of confusion  surrounding
         these codes and the minimum level of salary.  I  attach  above  the
         salary for a new entrant as at 10th April 2014 for occupation  code
         and the level of salary is now stated to be �20,400.  This  is  yet
         another figure different to that provided by  both  the  respondent
         and the appellant's employer.  It is clear that the employer's sole
         intention apart from employing the best candidate for the  position
         which they seemed to think is the case in relation to the appellant
         is to ensure that the correct level  of  new  entrant's  salary  is
         paid.  On the basis of the  information  currently  on  the  gov.uk
         website, where I found the figures today the  appellant's  previous
         salary for 39 hours of �20,475 would in fact have been  sufficient.



         Paragraph 10:

         Whatever,  the  level  required  as  at  the  date  of  application
         decision, the  appellant  and  her  sponsor  employer  have  always
         intended that she meets the Immigration Rules and the salary  offer
         was made on the basis of the correct understanding  of  the  Rules.
         The offer of salary now of �23,250 is well over the minimum and  so
         the appellant does appear to meet the Rules.  There was  never  any
         intention that the appellant would not  meet  the  requirements  of
         Appendix J."

Application for Permission to Appeal

12. The respondent made an application for  permission  on  the  basis  the
    judge incorrectly relied on the salary for a new  entrant  as  at  10th
    April 2014.

13. The relevant date is the date of decision 6th March  2014  and  at  the
    date of decision the appropriate salary rate was �22,500  specified  in
    Appendix A to the Immigration Rules in force between 25th February 2014
    and 6th April 2014.

14. The appellant's certificate of sponsorship stated that her salary would
    be �21,000 per annum for a 40 hour week which equates  to  �20,475  per
    annum for a 39 hour week.

15. As such the prospective salary was not at or above the minimum rate  as
    specified in Appendix J.

16. Thus the Immigration Rules could not be met and the  appeal  should  be
    dismissed.

17. A response to the appeal was submitted.  It was pointed  out  that  the
    current threshold was �22,500 and the new threshold was in fact reduced
    from 6th April 2014 to �20,400.  It was submitted that the  appellant's
    salary was always intended to be above the minimum  threshold  required
    under Appendix J.  It was submitted that  any  error  of  law  was  not
    material given the appeal would have been allowed in  any  event  since
    the mistake was rectified prior to the hearing date.

18. Permission to appeal was granted by First Tier Tribunal Judge Cruthers.

The Hearing

19. Mr Bramble relied on the grounds for permission to appeal.  He  pointed
    out that in Appendix A and further to paragraph 79A the appellant  must
    have a minimum of �20,300 but he also pointed out that at paragraph 79B
    that the salary must be the appropriate rate for the job as  stated  in
    the Codes of Practice at Appendix J.  As at the date  of  decision  the
    relevant rate for the salary was �22,500.  He submitted that the  judge
    had gone in the wrong direction and had looked at  the  current  salary
    level as at the date of the hearing (12th May 2014)   rather  than  the
    date of decision which was 6th March 2014.   A  subsequent  letter  had
    been provided but further to paragraph 79D no points would  be  awarded
    for an appropriate salary if the applicant  did  not  provide  a  valid
    certificate of sponsorship reference number with his application.  Thus
    to consider the matter at the date of the hearing was an error of law.

20. Mr Ross produced a screenshot  of  the  website  but  even  though  the
    minimum  salary rate which had been followed by the  employer  referred
    to �20,300 at the top there was also a  reference  to  the  appropriate
    rate for each occupation.

21. Also he submitted there had been a reference to confusion in  fact  the
    Immigration Rules were clear.

22. Mr Ross submitted that it was correct that the judge had considered the
    figures as at the date of the hearing but he pointed out that  in  fact
    the salary rate for this post had decreased as opposed  to  increasing.
    The employer was not confused and had read the  information  placed  on
    the website of the Secretary of State and the employer  had  relied  on
    that information.  The judge accepted that the only  intention  of  the
    employer was to pay the appellant at the correct rate and had acted  in
    good faith and this was a genuine mistake.  Mr Ross accepted that as at
    the date of the application  the  correct  salary  was  for  code  2429
    �22,500.

23. Ms Gulick attended the hearing and gave oral testimony indicating  that
    she had undertaken an English literature degree  in  Scotland  and  had
    proceeded to take a Masters degree at University College  London.   She
    had a flat and friends in London and  was  an  event  coordinator  with
    Caxton a foreign exchange company.  They had agreed  to  keep  her  job
    open should she need  to  return  to  the  States  to  make  a  further
    application but it would be very inconvenient.

24. The relevant Rule  is  paragraph  245HD(f)  and  this  states  that  if
    applying as a Tier 2  (General)  Migrant  the  applicant  must  have  a
    minimum of 50 points under paragraph 76 to 79D of  Appendix  A.   These
    were the Rules in force as at the relevant date which is  the  date  of
    decision of the Secretary of State and that date is 6th March 2014.  It
    is clear in the Rules at Appendix A that Rule  79A  states  "No  points
    will be awarded if the salary referred to in paragraph 79 is less  than
    �20,300 per year unless there are various exceptions."   The  appellant
    did not fulfil the exemptions.

25. In addition to the requirement under paragraph 79A,  and  this  is  the
    point, a further requirement is identified by paragraph 79B and this is
    as follows:

         "No points will be awarded for appropriate  salary  if  the  salary
         referred to in paragraph 79 above is less than the appropriate rate
         for the job as stated in the Codes of Practice at Appendix J unless
         the applicant is an established entertainer as defined in paragraph
         6 of these Rules".

26. The appellant is not an  established  entertainer  and  she  wishes  to
    remain in her job as an events coordinator for Caxton Company.

27. The fact is that as the date of decision which  is  6th  March  2014  a
    certificate of  sponsorship  was  submitted  with  the  application  in
    accordance with paragraph 79D but identified that the salary  would  be
    �20,300.

28. Even the screenshot stated that there was a minimum salary threshold as
    well as the appropriate rates for  each  occupation  and  the  relevant
    salary rate for job 2429 as an administrative professional was  �22,500
    and this was accepted by Mr Ross.  The further letter  from  Caxton  FX
    presented and confirming that the  salary  of  �23,250  per  annum  was
    confirmed was in a letter dated 20th March 2014 and this postdates  the
    decision made by the appellant.

29. As such the appellant cannot fulfil the Immigration Rules.

30. It was unfortunate that she did not obtain effective legal advice  from
    an  immigration  solicitor  and  I  can  accept  that  the  Rules   are
    complicated to understand and may appear harsh but the appellant cannot
    succeed in her appeal because she has not  shown  as  at  the  date  of
    either application or decision, even if the rules changed  days  later,
    and the relevant date for my purposes is the  decision,  that  she  was
    going to receive the required salary of �22,500.

31. The Supreme Court  in Patel and ors v SSHD [2013]  UKSC  72  reiterated
    the judgment of Stanley Burnton LJ in Miah v SSHD [2013] QB  35  (where
    an applicant was refused leave to remain as a Tier 2 (General)  Migrant
    at a time when he was two months short of the  five  years'  continuous
    residence necessary to support a case for indefinite  leave  to  remain
    under the rules) and confirmed the concept that 'A rule is a rule'  and
    that to be administratively workable the Immigration rules needed to be
    treated as such.

32. I therefore find there was an error of approach by  the  judge  at  the
    First-tier Tribunal and an  error  of  law  which  would  have  made  a
    material difference.  I remake the decision and for the  reasons  given
    above I dismiss the appeal of Ms Gulick.

Order

The appeal of Ms Gulick is dismissed.
