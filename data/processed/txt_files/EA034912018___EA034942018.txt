                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal was due to be heard on 9  November  2020.   On  6  November
    2020, the parties requested  the  Upper  Tribunal  to  dispose  of  the
    proceedings by making a consent order under rule 39(1) of the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.   The  draft  order,  which  was
    signed by the parties' representatives on 6 November 2020, was  in  the
    following terms:


         Pursuant to rule 39(1) of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
         Rules 2008, the parties consent to the disposal of the above appeal
         on the following agreed basis:


         1) That with the Tribunal's consent order  under  Rule  17(2)  the
            Secretary of State withdraws her case that  the  appellants  do
            not meet the requirements under the EEA Regulations 2016 to  be
            issued with family permits as the family members of  Mrs  Inese
            Dreimane, their daughter-in-law.


         2) That the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside,  and
            the appeal allowed for the following summary reasons.


               .  The  Secretary  of  State  agrees  with  the   appellant's
                 arguments that Mrs Dreimane falls to be treated as an  "EEA
                 National" under Regulation 2 as prior to acquiring  British
                 citizenship she had a right of permanent residence.


               . It is accepted that the appellants are dependent  upon  Mrs
                 Dreimane and their son, her husband.


               .  No  other  issues  exist  as  to  the  eligibility   under
                 Regulation 7 for a right of admission and residence.

 2. I  approved  the  consent  order  on  6  November  2020.   By  consent,
    therefore, the appeal is allowed under the EEA Regulations.
