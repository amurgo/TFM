For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                      ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is an error of law hearing. The appellant appeals the decision  of
    the First Tier Tribunal (Judge N Lodge) (FTT) promulgated on  15.2.2019
    in which the appellant's protection claim was dismissed.

Background
2.     The appellant is a citizen of Iraq.  He appealed the decision of  the
    respondent dated 18.11.2018  in  which  his  claim  for  protection  on
    political grounds was refused.  The appellant claimed  that  he  was  a
    former Ba'ath Party member and that he was involved in an ongoing blood
    feud with a tribal leader Jalal Kehhi Rafiq (JKR).

Grounds of appeal
3.   In grounds of appeal  the  appellant  argued  that  the  FTT  erred  by
    failing to consider the expert report from Dr George as to the identity
    of JKR which was dealt with in the report. The role of JKR went to  the
    core of the appellant's claim.

4.   The FTT failed to make  any  findings  as  to  the  appellant's  health
    issues of a diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder  (COPD)
    pursuant to AAH (Iraqi Kurds - internal relocation) Iraq  CG  UKUT  212
    (IAC).

Permission to appeal
5.    Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal (UT)  was  granted  by  FTJ
    Grant-Hutchison on both grounds.

Discussion and conclusion
6.   At the hearing before me I indicated that I  took  the  view  that  the
    grounds of appeal had been made out and that the  failure  to  properly
    consider the content of the expert report was a  material  error  given
    that the identity of JKR went to the core of the appellant's  claim.  I
    was also satisfied that the FTT failed to make any findings in relation
    to the appellant's individual circumstances in particular his diagnosis
    of COPD. In light of my indication neither Mr Tufan or Ms  Harper  made
    further submissions.

Decision
7. There is a material error of law in  the  decision  which  shall  be  set
    aside. I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (excluding FTJ N .
    Lodge) for a hearing de novo.
