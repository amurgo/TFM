For the Appellant:     Mr C Lam (Counsel)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge David Taylor, sitting in a panel with First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Manyarara, promulgated on 4th December 2014,  following  a  hearing  at
    Hatton Cross on 19th November 2014.  In the  determination,  the  judge
    allowed the appeal of Valentina Ahmataj.  The Respondent  Secretary  of
    State subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission  to  appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female, a citizen of Albania, who was born  on  23rd
    May 1990.  She appealed against the decision of  the  Respondent  dated
    11th June 2014, refusing her application  for  a  derivative  residence
    card as a primary carer  of  a  British  citizen  child  born  on  17th
    September 2013, by the name of Arli, to  the  Appellant  herself.   The
    refusal letter stated that the Appellant was unable to  show  that  the
    child lived with her, or spent the majority of his time with  her,  and
    that the Appellant had the day-to-day decisions to make  in  regard  to
    the child's health and education.

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge made the following findings (at paragraph 29).   First,  that
    the Appellant was the biological mother of this British citizen  child,
    Arli.  Second, that her husband was an exempt person  as  a  result  of
    having a right of abode in the UK.  Third, that  the  Appellant  was  a
    primary carer of the child of the Sponsor  and  herself.   Fourth,  the
    Appellant's husband was working and remained with the child on a day-to-
    day basis.  Fifth, the Appellant's husband worked from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.
    during the summer time and 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.  during  the  winter  time,
    rendering it impossible for him to care for the child due to  his  work
    commitments.  Sixth, that this led to the conclusion that the Appellant
    "who provides care for the child and, on the facts of this case,  there
    is no one else who can care for the child".  Seventh, that the  removal
    of the Appellant from the United Kingdom  would  result  in  the  child
    being required to leave the United Kingdom and the EEA  area  and  that
    "this is because the British citizen is 1 year old and is clearly at an
    age where he is reliant on the Appellant.  It is therefore unreasonable
    in the extreme to expect  the  Appellant  to  be  separated  from  him"
    (paragraph  29).   The  appeal  was  allowed  under  the   Regulations.
    Furthermore, with regard to Article 8, the panel heard that there  were
    good grounds also for  considering  that  the  Appellant's  case  would
    succeed outside the Regulations.   Furthermore,  with  respect  to  the
    "best interests  of  the  child"  it  was  further  accepted  that  the
    Appellant would succeed on this basis as well.

Grounds of Application

 4. The grounds of application state that in allowing the appeal the  panel
    erred because it  gave  inadequate  reasons  for  concluding  that  the
    Appellant was a primary carer  of  the  child,  rather  than  that  the
    responsibility was shared between both parents, and for concluding that
    the child would be unable to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  if  the
    Appellant were required to leave.  Furthermore, the panel wrongly found
    that the Respondent had rejected the Appellant's claim  under  Appendix
    FM of paragraph 276ADE when those decisions had been made.

 5. On 23rd January 2015, permission to appeal was granted.

 6. On 5th March 2015, a Rule 24 response was entered  by  the  Appellant's
    representative, Mr C Lam.

Submissions

 7. At the hearing before me on 9th March 2015,  Mr  Melvin,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Respondent Secretary of State, submitted that  the  judge
    had failed to apply the requirements of Regulations 15A(7) of the  2006
    Act.  Second, the judge had wrongly concluded that the Appellant mother
    was the "primary carer" of  the  child,  Arli.   This  is  because  the
    question of who is to be a primary  carer  was  a  question  of  choice
    between the mother and the father, and they  had  deliberately  decided
    this by choosing that the mother  would  be  the  primary  carer.   The
    judge's  conclusions   were   therefore   inadequate   and   borderline
    irrational.  There was no reason why the Sponsor could  not  return  to
    the home country and make a fresh application to re-enter  from  there.
    Second, as far as Article 8  was  concerned  the  Appellant  could  not
    succeed because Section 117B had to be applied and the  proportionality
    exercise undertaken on the basis of the public interest considerations.
     It was clear that any analysis and evaluation of Article 8 had  to  be
    done through the prism of the Immigration Rules.

 8. For his part, Mr Lam submitted that he would  rely  upon  his  Rule  24
    response.  He submitted that the judge had  clearly  given  reasons  in
    specific paragraphs under paragraph 29  setting  out  exactly  why  the
    mother was the primary carer.  The main reason was that the Appellant's
    husband  was  in  full-time  self-employment.   This  was  set  out  at
    paragraph 29(v).  His hours of work were such that he would not be able
    to be the "primary carer" of the child.  He was  away  for  practically
    the whole of the daylight hours during the  day  working.   The  child,
    Arli, was born on 17th September 2013 and was now 1ï¿½ years old, and  it
    was the Appellant's view that "it is unreasonable  in  the  extreme  to
    expect the Appellant to be separated  from  him"  (paragraph  29(vii)).
    The judge had also been correct as to Regulation 15A(7) of the 2006 Act
    because the Tribunal had held clearly that the Appellant's husband  was
    an exempt person.

 9. As far as Article 8 was concerned, the panel was entitled  to  consider
    family under Article 8 and under Section 55 of the BCIA 2009.   If  one
    looked at the Immigration Directorate Instruction (Appendix FM, Section
    1.0B) dated November 2014) it was clear at pages 52  and  53  that  the
    instruction given to immigration decision makers was that

         "Save in cases involving criminality, the decision maker  must  not
         take a decision in relation to the parent or  primary  carer  of  a
         British citizen child where the effect of that decision would be to
         force that British child to leave the EU, regardless of the age  of
         the child".

    It was the Tribunal's finding, properly arrived at  after  analysis  of
    the facts, that this would  indeed  be  the  case  if  the  mother  was
    required to leave the UK, given that the child was  just  a  year  old.
    All in all, the decision could not be said to unreasonable.

10. In reply, Mr Melvin submitted that the Appellant and  her  husband  had
    decided as a matter of choice that  the  primary  carer  would  be  the
    mother, this being so, it could not be said that the  decision  arrived
    at was an irrational one.  Mr Lam interjected to say that if  this  was
    the case, it made nonsense of having a provision dealing with  "primary
    carer".

No Error of Law

11. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  panel  in  this
    case did not amount to the making of an error on a point  of  law  (see
    Section 12(1) of TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the  decision.
    In what is a careful and comprehensive determination, the panel, headed
    by Judge David Taylor, had made specific  findings  of  fact  that  are
    unassailable.  The Appellant's husband works a good ten to eleven hours
    a day.  He is away from  home.   The  primary  responsibility  for  the
    child, Arli, rests with the Appellant.  She is the  biological  mother.
    In general a child's wellbeing is best assured with the natural parents
    and this is well-established under the jurisprudence  with  respect  to
    Section 55 BCIA.

12. The panel was clear that "removal of  the  Appellant  from  the  United
    Kingdom would result in the child being required to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom  ....  It is therefore unreasonable in the  extreme  to  expect
    the Appellant to be separated from him" (see paragraph 29(vii)).  It is
    difficult to see how this is an inadequate finding.

13. Second, any suggestion that the  Tribunal  was  unaware  of  Regulation
    15A(7) of the  2006  Act  is  misconceived  because  Regulation  15  is
    specifically set out from paragraph 24 to paragraph 27 (inclusive).  If
    the appeal is allowed under the Regulations, it was unnecessary for the
    Appellant to go on to consider Article 8 and the "best interests of the
    child".  However, the panel did so, and in so doing it  had  regard  to
    well-established authorities such as  Huang  [2007]  UKHL  11,  and  EB
    (Kosovo) [2008] UKHL 41, together with ZH  (Tanzania)  [2011]  UKSC  4.
    The decision arrived at was plainly open to this Tribunal and  it  gave
    good reasons for concluding as it did.  There is no error.

Notice of Decision

There is no material error of law in the  original  judge's  decision.   The
determination of this panel shall stand.

No anonymity order is made.
