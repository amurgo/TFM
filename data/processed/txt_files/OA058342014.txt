                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge E Lagunja, promulgated on 16th February 2015, following a hearing
    at Birmingham Sheldon Court on 7th January 2015.  In the determination,
    the judge allowed the  appeal  of  Mrs  Prende  Prendi,  whereupon  the
    Secretary  of  State  subsequently  applied  for,  and   was   granted,
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the  matter  comes
    before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Albania and she was  born  on  26th  July
    1989.  She appeals against the decision of the Respondent Secretary  of
    State, made under paragraph 281 of HC 395, and dated  2nd  April  2014,
    refusing her application to join her husband, a British citizen settled
    in the UK, under a spouse's visa.

 3. The refusal letter of 2nd April 2014 observes that the application  was
    initially refused under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules, but  this
    appeal was withdrawn by the Home Office for reconsideration  under  the
    previous provisions of  paragraph  281  given  the  Appellant's  online
    application was  dated  on  7th  July  2012.   The  Appellant  was  not
    interviewed because, "It has not been  necessary  to  interview".   The
    Grounds  for  Refusal  is  that  the  Appellant  maintained  that   her
    sponsoring husband, Mr Prendi, was self-employed and  the  director  of
    the company, Kaleford, "However you have provided no evidence of this".
     Although bank statements had been provided by the Appellant,  "However
    these show only that he has an income from 'Bella Venezi' - there is no
    evidence as to who or what this entity is, or what the terms  of  these
    payments are".  Accordingly, it was decided that the Appellant had  not
    adequately  demonstrated  that  her  sponsoring  husband's  income   or
    employment was to the level  required.   The  application  was  refused
    under paragraph 281(v).

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge referred  to  the  fact  that  the  Sponsor  had  provided  a
    "comprehensive bundle of documents for the appeal" and was assisted  by
    Mr Lammy, as a McKenzie friend.  The judge also confirmed that  because
    the application was made before 9th July 2012, it was considered  under
    the old Rules, namely, paragraph 281 of HC 395.  The single  issue  was
    whether the Sponsor had the ability to maintain the  Appellant  without
    recourse to public funds.  The judge went on to note that for a  couple
    aged over 18, "Without any dependence the figure to attain  is  �113.70
    per week" and that the Sponsor gave himself an income of at least  �500
    a week from his business (see paragraph 10).  The Sponsor gave evidence
    that he had previously owned a business called Kaleford  between  April
    2009 and 2010.  The Respondent was  not  satisfied  that  he  had  this
    business (see paragraph 11).

 5. However, the Sponsor's evidence was additionally also that in 2010, "He
    took ownership of a restaurant called Bella Venezi" and the judge  said
    that, "I found the Sponsor's  claimed  income  from  this  business  is
    relevant to this appeal" (paragraph  12).   Once  again  the  Sponsor's
    evidence was that he managed to pay himself at least �500 per week from
    the business.

 6. One aspect that did arise, however, was that

         "From the documents provided it would appear that the  Sponsor  did
         have a tax liability at the end of the year, however he  claims  he
         did not pay any tax because he was not required to.  In  the  light
         of this it may be necessary for the Sponsor to make  the  necessary
         enquiries with the tax authorities to ensure that he is  fulfilling
         his tax duties correctly" (paragraph 13).

 7. The judge also observed that the Appellant had provided bank statements
    in the Sponsor's name for a HSBC business account and a Lloyds personal
    bank account which begins in April  2014.   The  judge  observed  that,
    "There are a number of deposits each month from 'Bella Ven'  which  the
    Sponsor claims are payments from  his  business  Bella  Venezia".   The
    judge went on to observe that, "The  frequency  appears  to  be  weekly
    however at times it varies".  The judge concluded from  this  that,  "I
    find the variations in the deposits are consistent with the  nature  of
    self-employment and business activity" (paragraph 14).

 8. The judge at the end of the determination, however, added an additional
    observation, which is vehemently contested by the Respondent.  This was
    that, "As it is accepted that the Sponsor does own a business as he  is
    self-employed and therefore cannot produce wage slips  as  evidence  of
    income, I find the bank  statements  provide  strong  support  for  the
    Sponsor's claims ..." (paragraph 15).  The Respondent, it would appear,
    had never accepted that the Sponsor owned a business.

 9. The appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

10. The grounds of application state that the judge did  not  consider  the
    Respondent Secretary of State's contention that the Sponsor's  evidence
    did not establish ownership of his claimed business.   Moreover,  there
    was a theory about the judge to take sufficient  account  of  the  non-
    payment of tax by the Sponsor in  considering  the  lawfulness  of  his
    claimed income.

11. On 23rd April 2015, permission was granted with the  observation  that,
    "The above could be construed as normal than an attempt to re-argue the
    Respondent's case, but no reason was given by the judge at paragraph 15
    for the comment that 'it is now accepted that the Sponsor  does  own  a
    business'" (see paragraph 3).

12. Permission to appeal was granted.

The Hearing

13. At the hearing before me on 21st January 2016,  Mr  Prendi  once  again
    appeared, assisted by a McKenzie friend, Mr Lammy, who sat at the  back
    of the courtroom.  For the Secretary of State, Mr Mills, a Senior  Home
    Office Presenting Officer, attended.  Mr Mills began by saying that  it
    was the Secretary of State's appeal, and the issue was a narrow one.

14. Mr Mills went on to explain that the  Sponsor's  application  was  made
    before 9th July 2012 and therefore had to be considered under paragraph
    281  of  HC  395.   Indeed,  this  was  a  case  where  originally  the
    application had been determined under Appendix  FM,  only  to  be  then
    revoked, and a new  decision  made  under  paragraph  281  of  HC  395.
    Second, the challenge was that it was never conceded that the Appellant
    was self-employed or had his own business.  Yet, at paragraph  15,  the
    judge states that, "As it is accepted  that  the  Sponsor  does  own  a
    business ...".  This was untrue.  The Entry Clearance Officer  did  not
    concede it and the Entry Clearance Manager did not concede it.  It  was
    also at the hearing before Judge Lagunja not conceded.

15. Finally, the judge states that the Appellant believed that he  did  not
    have a tax liability, and therefore was not paying tax for  that  year,
    but that this may be something that,  "It  may  be  necessary  for  the
    Sponsor to make the necessary enquiries" in relation to, with  the  tax
    authorities (see paragraph 13).  However,  if  the  Appellant  was  not
    paying tax then he could not be in receipt of lawful income.

16. There was one other issue namely, the availability of  evidence  twelve
    months prior to the application, to show that the Appellant had  earned
    income as a self-employed person.  The date of decision is 16th January
    2015, but there was no  income  for  the  twelve  months  preceding  in
    relation to the business, which could be relied upon given  that  every
    self-employed person has funds coming in, in sporadic terms, so that  a
    trail of income is difficult to establish.   Mr  Mills  suggested  that
    what appeared at tab D in terms of the tax return from  April  2012  to
    2013 was suspect.

17. For his part, Mr Prendi submitted that he could not understand why this
    matter was being appealed.  The business that  he  has,  namely,  Bella
    Venezi, is registered  under  his  name.   He  has  a  lease  for  that
    business.  He pays tax currently.  At the time, his accountant  advised
    him not to pay tax because there was no liability.

18. In reply, Mr Mills submitted that a decision made under  paragraph  281
    does not restrict the availability of evidence right up to the time  of
    the date of the hearing.  It was open to  the  Appellant  to  have  the
    Sponsor submit evidence right up to today.  If the incomes existed  and
    could be related back to the  business  it  was  open  to  produce  the
    evidence.  None had been produced.   He  asked  me  to  set  aside  the
    decision to remake the decision without relating it back to the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

No Error of Law

19. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.  My  reasons  are
    as follows.  This is a case where the previous Rules fell to be applied
    because the application was a pre 9th July 2012 application  which  had
    to be determined under paragraph 281 of HC 395.  There was no financial
    potential requirement of �18,600 that currently applies under  Appendix
    FM.

20. Secondly,  the  judge  considered  the  evidence  in  relation  to  the
    Sponsor's income.  She did so specifically  in  relation  to  what  was
    required  in  terms  of  a  couple's  maintenance  needs,  without  any
    dependants, and noted the figure of �113.70 per week.   She  said  that
    the Sponsor allows himself an income of �500 a week from his  business.
    This was the case both for Kaleford which the Sponsor owned from  April
    2009 to 2010 and subsequently from his  restaurant  business  of  Bella
    Venezi, which he owned from 2010 onwards (see paragraphs 10  to  12  of
    the determination).

21. Third, regardless of whether "It is accepted that the Sponsor does  own
    a business" (see paragraph 15),  the  fact  remains  that  it  was  the
    judge's express finding that the Sponsor did own now a business  called
    Bella Venezi (see paragraph 14).   There  was  an  HSBC  business  bank
    account and there were a number of  deposits  each  month  from  "Bella
    Ven".  The judge observed that the frequency appears to be  weekly  but
    also varies and that this was consistent with being self-employed.

22. Finally, the suggestion that the Sponsor may well be  avoiding  tax  is
    not borne out by the facts.  The evidence before the  judge  was  that,
    "He claims he did not pay any tax  because  he  was  not  required  to"
    (paragraph 13).  In these circumstances, it was entirely understandable
    that the judge should say that, "In light of this it may  be  necessary
    for  the  Sponsor  to  make  the  necessary  enquiries  with  the   tax
    authorities to ensure that he is fulfilling his tax  duties  correctly"
    (paragraph 13).  It has to be remembered that this was a new  business,
    and that previously the Sponsor was connected with  Kaleford  up  until
    2010.

23. In any event, the matter is entirely speculative but what is  important
    is that the judge made a  finding  that  the  Appellant  was  receiving
    income, which tended to vary from week to week, from a business called,
    "Bella Venezi" for which he had an HSBC  business  bank  account.   The
    decision only had to be made on a balance of probabilities.  The  judge
    so made it.  Given the latest Tribunal judgment in Dasgupta [2016] UKUT
    00028, that in error of law appeals, the Upper  Tribunal  should  apply
    the principle in Edwards v Bairstow [1956] AC 14, it is not possible to
    say that the judge erred in coming to the conclusions that she did.

Decision

There is no material error of law in the  original  judge's  decision.   The
determination shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
