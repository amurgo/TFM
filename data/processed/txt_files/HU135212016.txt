Representation:

For the Appellant:           Mr G McIndoe, solicitor, Latitude Law
For the Respondent:      Mr G Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

    1. The Appellant, who is a national  of  Pakistan,  appeals  against  a
       decision of First-Tier Tribunal  Judge  Hussain  promulgated  on  22
       February 2017 ("the Decision") dismissing  her  appeal  against  the
       Respondent's decision dated 20 April 2016 refusing  her  application
       dated 26 January 2016 for entry clearance as the spouse of a  person
       who is recognised as a refugee in the UK, Mr S ("the Sponsor").


    2. The Respondent refused the Appellant's application on the basis that
       her marriage to the  Sponsor  was  conducted  via  proxies  and  was
       therefore not valid.  The application was also rejected on the basis
       that  the  Sponsor's  earnings  did  not  meet  the  Minimum  Income
       Requirement ("MIR")  under  the  Immigration  Rules  ("the  Rules").
       Finally, the Respondent considered the application as if it were  an
       application to join the Sponsor as his fianc�e but refused  that  on
       the basis that the Appellant did not say that she intended to  marry
       the Sponsor in the UK.  The application was also refused outside the
       Rules on the basis that refusal did not involve a  breach  of  human
       rights.


    3. The Judge also found that the marriage was not valid.  He did so, on
       the basis that the domicile of the Sponsor is in  the  UK  and  that
       validity  of  the  marriage  depends  on  that  domicile.   He  also
       considered the issue of the Sponsor's income.  Although  he  reached
       no concluded findings on this issue, he  appears  to  have  accepted
       that the evidence before him showed that the Sponsor's total  annual
       income is in the region of �21,444 (which exceeds the MIR).


    4. The Appellant pleads two grounds.  First, she says there is an error
       of law in relation to the finding on the validity of  the  marriage.
       She points to case-law which she says establishes that the  relevant
       law when determining the validity of a marriage  is  the  "lex  loci
       celebrationis" (ie the law of the  country  where  the  marriage  is
       celebrated) and not the law of the country of  domicile  of  one  or
       both of the parties.  Second, whilst accepting  that  there  was  an
       error  made  by  the  Sponsor  when   completing   the   Appellant's
       application, it is said that the Judge failed to take  into  account
       evidence before him in the form of employers' letters, payslips  and
       personal bank  statements  which  show  that  the  Sponsor's  income
       exceeds the MIR.


    5. Permission to appeal was granted by Designated  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge Murray on 21 September 2017 in the following terms (so far  as
       relevant):-


            "3.  There is an issue as to whether the sponsor's domicile was
           in the United Kingdom at the  date  of  the  marriage.   He  has
           refugee status here but he is a Pakistani national and he  could
           not go to Pakistan to get married as he is a refugee.  Lex  loci
           celebrationis governs marriage validity.   With  regard  to  the
           financial situation, based on  what  was  before  the  judge  it
           appears that his income is satisfactory.  The  judge  refers  to
           this at paragraph 12 of the decision but the judge does not make
           conclusive findings on this issue as he was dismissing the claim
           based on the validity of the proxy marriage.
            4.   There are arguable errors of law in the judge's decision."




    6. The matter comes before me to decide whether the Decision contains a
       material error of law and, if so, to re-make the decision  or  remit
       the appeal for rehearing to the First-Tier Tribunal.


    7. I indicated at the conclusion of the hearing before me  that  I  was
       satisfied that an error of law has been shown on  both  grounds  and
       that I proposed to  set  aside  the  Decision  and  to  re-make  the
       decision on the papers on the evidence  before  me.   Neither  party
       objected to that course.   I  indicated  that  I  would  provide  my
       decision and reasons in writing which I now turn to do.


    Decision and reasons


    8. I do not need to set out the  passage  in  the  Decision  where  the
       validity of the marriage is considered by the Judge.  As Mr  McIndoe
       submitted (correctly) and as Mr Harrison appeared to  accept,  based
       on case-law, the  relevant  law  to  determine  the  validity  of  a
       marriage in the UK is that of the  country  where  the  marriage  is
       celebrated and not the law of the parties' domicile.  The  relevance
       of domicile is, as Mr McIndoe rightly submitted,  relevant  only  to
       the question of capacity of the parties  to  marry  which  does  not
       arise in this case.


    9. In support of that proposition, I need do no more than set  out  the
       headnote in CB (Validity of marriage: proxy marriage) Brazil  [2008]
       UKAIT 00080 as follows:-
           "There is no exception in  immigration  cases  to  the  rule  of
           private international law that the validity  of  a  marriage  is
           governed by the lex loci celebrationis and on the  authority  of
           Apt v Apt [1948] P83 there is no reason in public policy to deny
           recognition to a proxy marriage."
       That decision was cited with approval by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
       Awuku v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017]  EWCA  Civ
       178 (at [16]).  Although that latter decision concerns the  validity
       of marriages between third-country and EEA nationals, it nonetheless
       confirms the principle that the validity of a  marriage  depends  on
       the laws of the country where the marriage is celebrated.


   10. For the foregoing reasons, the Judge has clearly  erred  in  law  by
       following the Respondent's lead in assessing  the  validity  of  the
       marriage by reference to the law of  the  country  of  domicile  and
       finding the marriage not to be valid because proxy marriages are not
       valid in UK law.  I therefore set aside his finding on this aspect.


   11. In this case, the marriage was  conducted  in  Pakistan.   There  is
       evidence that the marriage has been registered by the authorities of
       that country and there is also evidence in the form of a letter from
       the person who officiated at the ceremony about the way in which  it
       was conducted (via Skype/phone).  There is a bundle  of  photographs
       on file.  Although there is no covering statement  explaining  their
       contents, it is clear that some of those are of the wedding ceremony
       and corroborate the manner in which the ceremony was conducted.


   12.  I am satisfied by that  evidence  that  the  marriage  between  the
       Appellant and the Sponsor is valid.  Proxy marriages  are  valid  in
       the laws of Pakistan as is recognised by the formal registration  of
       the marriage, no question of the capacity to marry of  either  party
       arises and therefore UK law (the law of the Sponsor's domicile)  has
       no part to play.  As recorded  in  the  case-law  to  which  I  have
       referred, there is no reason in public policy to deny recognition to
       a proxy marriage.




   13.  The  other  reason  given  by  the  Respondent  for  refusing   the
       Appellant's application for entry clearance is  that  the  Sponsor's
       income does not meet the MIR.  I  accept  that  the  Judge  did  not
       consider it necessary to reach a concluded finding  on  this  issue,
       having found that the marriage was not valid in  UK  law.   However,
       there is an error in [12] of the Decision where the Judge deals with
       this aspect because the Judge failed to note that there was evidence
       beyond simply the employers' letters confirming  income  and  failed
       therefore to deal with that evidence.  Further and in any event, the
       error made in relation to  the  validity  of  the  marriage  clearly
       impacts on the remainder of the Decision.


   14. The Appellant has very helpfully provided a bundle of  the  evidence
       on which reliance is placed in this  regard.   Although  Mr  McIndoe
       submitted that this evidence was  before  both  the  Judge  and  the
       Respondent that cannot be so in relation to all of the evidence as a
       few items post-date the date of application.  However, there  is  no
       longer any  limitation  on  my  ability  to  consider  post-decision
       evidence in entry clearance cases and I therefore consider the issue
       of the Sponsor's income based on all the information before me.


   15. I conduct this exercise mindful of the fact that the issue I have to
       decide is whether the decision to  refuse  entry  clearance  to  the
       Appellant breaches her (and the Sponsor's) human rights rather  than
       whether the Respondent's decision is in accordance with  the  Rules.
       It is though relevant to that issue whether the criteria  under  the
       Rules are substantially met.


   16. The evidence as to income which is before me is as follows:-
                  a) A schedule of employment income from 1 August 2015  to
                     31 January 2016 showing  monthly  payments  of  income
                     from McDonalds Ltd and Alpha Fuels Ltd in relation  to
                     the Sponsor.
                  b) Barclays Bank account statements in the  name  of  the
                     Sponsor beginning on 7 August 2015  and  ending  on  5
                     February 2016.
                  c) P60 certificates for tax  year  ending  5  April  2016
                     showing earnings of �13,841.69 in relation to earnings
                     from McDonalds Ltd and �6,669.00 in relation to  Alpha
                     Fuels Ltd.
                  d) A letter from McDonalds  Ltd  dated  8  December  2015
                     confirming that the Sponsor has  been  employed  as  a
                     full-time crew member by  McDonalds  Ltd  since  March
                     2013, earns �6.71 per  hour  and  works  approximately
                     forty to forty-eight hours per week up to a maximum of
                     forty-eight hours.
                  e) Payslips from McDonalds Ltd from 13 February  2015  to
                     15 January 2016.  Those show the  Applicant's  working
                     hours in units.  Insofar as the dates correspond  with
                     the bank statements at  (b)  above,  the  net  amounts
                     earned correspond  to  the  amounts  credited  to  the
                     Sponsor's account.
                  f) A letter from Alpha Fuels Ltd dated  8  December  2015
                     confirming that the Sponsor has been employed since  1
                     February 2015 as an Assistant Manager working  sixteen
                     hours (flexible) per week at �9 per hour.   His  gross
                     pay is said to be �7,488 per annum.
                  g) Payslips from Alpha Fuels Ltd from 15 March 2015 to 15
                     April 2016.  Those  show  that  the  number  of  hours
                     worked vary from 41 hours to 74.25  hours  per  month.
                     The hours  worked  are  though  since  September  2015
                     relatively stable at between  sixty  and  seventy-five
                     hours per month.  That equates to about sixteen  hours
                     per week as is confirmed  by  the  employer's  letter.
                     Insofar  as  the  dates  correspond  with   the   bank
                     statements  at  (b)  above,  the  net  amounts  earned
                     correspond to the amounts credited  to  the  Sponsor's
                     account.


   17. The schedule of income is said to show an average monthly income  of
       �1644.34 and  an  average  annual  income  of  �19,732.08.  The  P60
       certificates to which  I  have  referred  show  a  total  income  of
       �20,510.69.


   18. The bank statements show an opening balance  on  7  August  2015  of
       �5,419 and a closing balance on 5 February 2016 of  �7,064.30.   The
       covering summary also shows that the Sponsor has an "Everyday Saver"
       account which held a balance of �10,009.32 on 4 September 2015  (the
       closing date of the first statement) and �16,017.74  on  5  February
       2016.   The lowest balance shown in the current  account  statements
       is on 14 December 2015 when the balance stood  at  �3883.21.   Those
       statements also show regular monthly receipts from Alpha  Fuels  Ltd
       and McDonalds Ltd.  Those are as follows:-
           Alpha Fuels Ltd
            17 August 2015: �525.60
            15 September 2015:    �471.50
            15 October 2015:      �471.70
            18 November 2015:     �471.50
            15 December 2015:     �482.40
            15 January 2016:      �432.00


            McDonalds Ltd
            28 August 2015: �938.31
            25 September 2015:    �986.57
            23 October 2015:      �1001.96
            20 November 2015:     �897.52
            18 December 2015:     �938.84
            15 January 2016:      �915.67




   19. Although as is evident from the employer's letters and payslips, the
       hours worked vary from week to week and month to month, the  amounts
       earned are relatively  consistent.   The  lowest  amount  earned  is
       �1347.67 (net) in January 2016.   The  highest  amount  is  �1473.66
       (net) in October 2015.  Averaged over the period, the gross  monthly
       income is �1644.34 as confirmed by the schedule which, applied to  a
       year is �19,732.08.  That is if anything lower than the figure shown
       on the P60 certificates for the relevant tax year.


   20. Having regard to what those documents  show,  the  Sponsor's  income
       exceeds the MIR.


   21. The issue raised by the Respondent in the refusal of entry clearance
       as to the relationship is based on the validity of the marriage.  In
       light of what I say  about  the  validity  of  the  marriage,  I  am
       satisfied that the Appellant is married to the Sponsor.


   22. It is not said that the relationship is not otherwise  genuine.   If
       confirmation of that were needed, the Respondent went on to consider
       the relationship under the Rules relating to  fianc�es  which  there
       would have been no point in  doing  if  the  relationship  were  not
       considered to be genuine.  The application on that basis was refused
       because the Appellant did not say that she  intended  to  marry  the
       Sponsor on arrival in the UK (her position no doubt being  that  she
       had no need to do so as she was already legally married).


   23. I  have  seen  no  evidence  which  causes  me  to  doubt  that  the
       relationship is genuine.   There is limited evidence of  the  couple
       together for the obvious reason that they have not been able to live
       in the same country. The Appellant had applied to visit the  Sponsor
       in the UK in September 2015 but was refused a visa, no doubt on  the
       basis that she was in a relationship with a person  settled  in  the
       UK. The Sponsor cannot visit the Appellant in Pakistan because he is
       a recognised refugee from that country. There are however within the
       bundle of photographs to which I  refer  above,  a  few  photographs
       which show them together which were taken, according to the  grounds
       of appeal, during their honeymoon visit to Turkey in November  2015.




   24. Based on the evidence on file and that the Respondent does not  take
       issue with the genuineness of the relationship, I  accept  that  the
       relationship between the Appellant and the Sponsor  is  genuine  and
       that the Appellant has a family life with the Sponsor which  engages
       Article 8 ECHR.


   25. I also accept that refusal of entry clearance interferes  with  that
       family life sufficiently to require justification.  In particular in
       this case, there is no question of the Sponsor joining the Appellant
       in Pakistan or  even  being  able  to  visit  her  there  as  he  is
       recognised as a  refugee  from  that  country.   There  are  clearly
       insurmountable obstacles to family life being conducted in Pakistan.
       That factor also weighs heavily in the balance when considering  the
       proportionality of the decision  to  refuse  entry  clearance.   The
       effect of  refusing  the  Appellant  entry  clearance  is  that  the
       Appellant and  the  Sponsor  are  deprived  of  the  opportunity  to
       continue their  family  life  in  the  same  country  and  would  be
       constrained to conducting it by means of telephone and other similar
       contact (as they have done since their wedding).


   26. Turning then to the public interest justifying a  refusal  of  entry
       clearance, the matters relied upon by the Respondent  are  that  the
       marriage is not valid and that the Sponsor does not earn  enough  to
       meet the MIR.  I have already explained why I reject both  of  those
       reasons. I am satisfied on the evidence which I have seen  that  the
       Sponsor earns an amount which  exceeds  the  MIR  or  at  least  has
       sufficient funds to be able to maintain the Appellant.  There is  no
       suggestion  that  effective   immigration   control   requires   the
       Appellant's exclusion from the UK for any other reason.    That  the
       application substantially meets the  criteria  under  the  Rules  is
       relevant to the weight to be given to the public interest.


   27. Balancing the significant consequences for the relationship  between
       the Appellant and  the  Sponsor  of  refusing  the  Appellant  entry
       clearance and the weight to be given to the public interest which is
       limited, in particular because the application  substantially  meets
       the criteria for entry under the Rules,  I  am  satisfied  that  the
       decision to refuse  the  Appellant  entry  clearance  amounts  to  a
       disproportionate interference with the  right  to  respect  for  the
       family life between the Appellant and the Sponsor.  It follows  that
       I find that the decision to refuse entry clearance is unlawful under
       section 6 of the Human Rights  Act  1998.   I  therefore  allow  the
       appeal.


DECISION
    I am satisfied that the Decision contains material errors of  law.  The
    decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Hussain  promulgated  on  22
    February 2017 is set aside.
    I re-make the decision.  I allow the appeal.

          Signed                        Dated: 26 January 2018
