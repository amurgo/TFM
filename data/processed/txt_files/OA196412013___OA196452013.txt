                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the appellants:    Mr M M Puar, instructed by NC Brothers & Co
Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, BG, date of birth 18.12.89, is a citizen of Nepal. It is
    now claimed that her son, BR, date of birth 7.4.10, is either a British
    citizen or entitled to British nationality.

 2. These are their linked appeals against the determination of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Clarke promulgated  25.7.14,  dismissing  their  appeals
    against the decision of the respondent, dated 1.10.13, to refuse  their
    applications made on 1.8.13 for entry clearance to the  United  Kingdom
    to settle as the spouse and son, respectively, of DR, a British citizen
    present in the UK.  The Judge heard the appeal on 10.7.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Ransley  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    15.10.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 27.11.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 5. Following the submissions of both Mr Puar and Mr Avery, Mr Puar  sought
    at that late stage to add further grounds  of  appeal.  I  refused  his
    application, bearing in mind that we were part-way through the  hearing
    and there had been ample opportunity in the months since the First-tier
    Tribunal appeal hearing to apply to add further grounds of  appeal.  No
    explanation was offered as to why that was not  done  and  I  therefore
    refused the  application,  conscious  that  the  Secretary  of  State's
    representative would have had no opportunity to consider or address the
    further grounds of appeal. In the circumstances, I considered it was in
    the public interest to proceed with the appeal hearing on  the  grounds
    advanced when seeking permission to appeal.

 6. In his submissions Mr Puar alleged  that  certain  documents  had  been
    handed in to the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  at  the  appeal  hearing.
    However, no such documents were with the case  papers  and  considering
    the careful way in which the judge set out the  evidence  received  and
    taken into account at �5 and �10-�13, and  absence  of  any  admissible
    evidence that the documents were placed before  the  judge,  I  am  not
    satisfied that those documents  were  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  and  thus  refused  to  consider  them  in  the  error  of   law
    consideration.

Error of Law

 7. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Clarke should be set aside.

 8. The essence of the grounds of  application  for  permission  to  appeal
    contend that the second appellant was entitled to  British  citizenship
    as of right and thus the judge's assessment of the financial  threshold
    required under Appendix FM was in error, and that  the  proportionality
    assessment was in consequence so flawed that the decision cannot  stand
    and must be set aside.

 9. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Ransley summarised the  grounds
    of appeal and simply that that the decision had been shown  to  involve
    arguable errors of law thus permission to appeal was granted.

10. The Rule 24 response, dated 14.11.14, noted  that  the  judge  was  not
    aware of the second appellant's claimed nationality, and as it was  not
    drawn to the judge's attention, it cannot be an error of  law  for  the
    judge not to have proceeded on that basis. "The judge was not persuaded
    by the specified evidence  and  was  further  not  convinced  that  the
    sponsor gave a credible account of various matters. No material  errors
    of law are identified. It  remains  open  to  the  appellants  to  make
    further application as required."

11. It is regrettable that  at  no  stage  prior  to  the  application  for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was the claimed  nationality
    of the second appellant drawn  to  the  respondent  or  the  Tribunal's
    attention. It was not identified at the application, refusal  decision,
    or appeal stage.  It  is  clear  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    proceeded on the basis that the  second  appellant  was  a  citizen  of
    Nepal. The judge  was  aware,  from  �11  of  the  decision,  that  the
    sponsor's certificate of registration as a British citizen was included
    in the appeal bundle.

12. The grounds allege and permission to appeal was granted  on  the  basis
    that the nationality of the second appellant  was  a  Robinson  obvious
    point, as he was born after the sponsor was  registered  as  a  British
    citizen. If this is correct and an error of law, it follows  that  both
    the financial threshold for Appendix FM was incorrectly stated, since a
    British citizen child  is  not  to  be  added  to  the  �18,600  income
    requirement for a couple, and that the proportionality assessment would
    be entirely skewed as it  failed  to  take  into  account  the  claimed
    nationality of the second appellant.

13. Whilst the second appellant may  well  be  entitled  to  claim  British
    citizenship, it is not clear to me that he is a British  citizen  until
    that right has been asserted and granted. It is evident that the second
    appellant does not have a British passport and has  never  applied  for
    one. I am wrong on that point, as Mr Puar asserted, the  crucial  issue
    is whether a material mistake of fact that is  not  the  fault  of  the
    judge and was not drawn to his attention at any time can be regarded as
    an error of law requiring the decision to be set aside  and  remade  by
    allowing the appeal to the  extent  that  the  decision  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer was also made on an erroneous basis and thus was  not
    in accordance with the law and thus it remains for the Entry  Clearance
    Officer to make a decision which is in accordance with the law.

14. In R and Others v  SSHD  [2005]  EWCA  Civ  982,  Lord  Justice  Brooke
    summarised the points of law which would be encountered most frequently
    in practice as follows: (i) making perverse or irrational  findings  on
    matters that were material to the outcome (ii) failure to give  reasons
    or any adequate reasons for findings on material matters (iii)  failing
    to take into account and/or resolve conflicts of  fact  or  opinion  on
    material matters (iv) giving weight to immaterial matters (v) making  a
    material misdirection of law on any material matter (vi) committing  or
    permitting a procedural or  other  irregularity  capable  of  making  a
    material difference to the outcome or fairness of the proceedings (vii)
    making a mistake as to a material fact which could  be  established  by
    objective and uncontentious evidence  when  the  appellant  and/or  his
    advisors were not responsible for  the  mistake  and  where  unfairness
    resulted from the fact that a mistake was made.

15. On this issue it cannot be said that the decision of the judge, made on
    the assumption that the second appellant was a citizen  of  Nepal,  was
    perverse or irrational, or that it was unreasoned, or took  account  of
    immaterial matters. If the second appellant is a  British  citizen,  it
    may well be a mistake as to a material fact which could be  established
    by objective and uncontentious evidence,  but  the  fact  remains  that
    there  was  evidence  as  to  the  second  appellant  having   Nepalese
    nationality. That was what was placed before the  judge.  Further,  the
    responsibility for such a mistake must lie entirely with the  appellant
    or his legal advisors; the judge cannot be expected to raise  an  issue
    that no one else has relied on. I do not accept that it is  a  Robinson
    obvious matter. Mr Avery suggested that the decision was not unfair  as
    it was open to the first appellant to make a fresh application once the
    second appellant's nationality was clarified, and the  very  nature  of
    the application may well be different to that made. It also  occurs  to
    me that there can be no unfairness  to  the  second  appellant  in  any
    event, as if he is a British citizen, he does not need leave  to  enter
    the UK and may do so once he has obtained a  passport  to  confirm  his
    British nationality.

16. In AH (Eritrea) [2005] UKIAT 00015 the Appellant applied to  enter  the
    UK as a visitor for his daughter's wedding.  On  appeal  he  mistakenly
    ticked the box indicating that he wanted the appeal determined  on  the
    papers, yet ticked the box asking that his daughter be notified of  the
    hearing date.  The Tribunal said that a mistake of fact giving rise  to
    unfairness, for  which  neither  the  claimant  nor  his  advisors  was
    responsible, was required as per E and R [2004] EWCA Civ 49  for  there
    to be a material error of law.  In that case, even if there had been  a
    mistake, the Appellant was responsible for it.  He could make  a  fresh
    application and his appeal was dismissed.

17. In the circumstances and in the light  of  the  case  law  referred  to
    above, I find that whilst there may have been a mistake of fact  giving
    rise to potential unfairness, the error was the responsibility  of  the
    appellants and/or their legal advisors, and not the  responsibility  of
    the Tribunal. Whilst I have given anxious consideration as to the issue
    of fairness and the further delay that may be occasioned, I  find  that
    the correct remedy is not to send the case all  the  way  back  to  the
    Secretary of State to remake the decision,  which  may  result  in  yet
    further delay, but for the second appellant to clarify his  nationality
    with the relevant authorities and, on the assumption that he is  either
    a British  citizen  or  entitled  to  British  citizenship,  the  first
    appellant may then make a fresh application for entry clearance.

Conclusions:

18. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal  of   each   appellant   remains   dismissed   on
                    immigration and human rights grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal made  an  order  pursuant  to  rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I continue the anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeals have been dismissed  and  thus  there  can  be  no  fee
award.
