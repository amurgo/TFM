                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State for the Home Department
         (SSHD) against the decision of Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         Rodger promulgated on 11 March  2016  in  which  she  allowed  MM's
         appeal against the SSHD's decision  to  make  a  deportation  order
         against MM under Regulations 19(3)(b) and  21  of  the  Immigration
         (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (the  2006  Regulations).
         For the purpose of  this  decision  I  will  refer  to  MM  as  the
         'claimant'.

Background

      2. The claimant is a national of Poland, born in March 1971. He claims
         to have first entered the UK in 2008 pursuant to his rights of free
         movement under EEA law. The SSHD accepts that the claimant has been
         resident in the UK in accordance with the 2006  Regulations  for  a
         continuous period of 5 years, that  he  has  attained  a  permanent
         right of residence under the provisions of  the  2006  Regulations,
         and that his deportation can only be justified on  serious  grounds
         of public policy or public security.


      3. Prior to entering the UK the claimant had been convicted of
         multiple offences in Poland relating to theft, robbery, aggravated
         extortion. He received multiple sentences of imprisonment,
         including a sentence of imprisonment of eight years.

      4. The claimant has a number of convictions in the United Kingdom. In
         June 2010 he was convicted in a Magistrates Court on two counts of
         possession of a Class B controlled drug with intent to supply. He
         received a community sentence with a curfew requirement for eight
         weeks. Later that year the claimant was convicted in a Magistrates
         Court of two counts of possession of a Class B controlled drug for
         which he received a �100 fine in respect of each count. In November
         2012 the claimant was convicted of possessing an offensive weapon
         in a public place. He received a community order and was ordered to
         pay �85 costs. On 2 September 2015 the claimant was convicted of
         possession of a controlled Class B drug and possession of a
         controlled Class A drug. He received a community order with an
         unpaid work requirement and was ordered to pay �85 costs and a
         victim surcharge of �60. On 12 January 2016 the claimant pleaded
         guilty to an offence of driving a motor vehicle without much
         insurance for which he received an absolute discharge. The claimant
         has never received a custodial sentence in the United Kingdom.


      5. The claimant has two children in the UK, an 11-year-old stepchild
         and a four-year-old biological child. Both children have been
         subject to Child Protection Plans under the category of emotional
         abuse since 4 December 2013. At the date of the First-tier Tribunal
         hearing the claimant had been granted the right, pursuant to a
         Court Order dated 29 October 2015, to have weekly supervised
         contact with his children. No supervised contact had occurred by
         the date of the First-tier Tribunal hearing.


      6. On 1 April 2015 the claimant was encountered by police and was
         served with a liability to deportation notice. On 6 May 2015 the
         decision was made to make a deportation order against the claimant.
         The claimant appealed that decision and, in response to further
         representations made on behalf of the claimant, the respondent
         served two supplementary reasons for refusal letters dated 27 May
         2015 and 22 February 2016.

      7. It was the SSHD's view that there were serious grounds of public
         policy to justify the claimant's deportation. The SSHD did not
         accept that the claimant had a genuine and subsisting relationship
         with his two children. The SSHD believed the claimant's offences in
         the UK were serious and remarked that the trade in illegal drugs
         has a severe effect on society. The SSHD believed the claimant's
         conviction history indicated an antisocial attitude towards the
         public and an established pattern of repeated offending within a
         relatively short period of time. The SSHD considered whether the
         claimant's removal would be proportionate. It was noted that the
         claimant was 44 years old and was healthy enough to return to
         Poland and successfully reintegrate into society. The SSHD
         considered the possibility that the claimant had extensive social
         and family relationships in Poland to whom he could turn for
         support. The SSHD also believed the claimant had sufficient skills,
         knowledge and experience acquired through his work in the United
         Kingdom to enable him to maintain himself in Poland. The SSHD noted
         that the claimant had family in the United Kingdom but considered
         that he would be able to access rehabilitation facilities in
         Poland. In her conclusion the SSHD considered that the claimant had
         committed a serious criminal offence in Poland and had continued to
         offend in the United Kingdom and, as such, posed a real risk of
         reoffending in the future. It was considered that he posed a threat
         of serious harm to the public and that his removal would be
         proportionate and in accordance with the principles of regulation
         21(5).

The First-tier Tribunal decision

      8. At his appeal hearing the claimant gave evidence in person and was
         cross-examined. His brother also gave evidence. In a detailed
         decision the judge fully set out the claimant's immigration and
         offending history and recorded the submissions from both
         representatives. The judge accurately set out the relevant burden
         and standard of proof and indicated that she had taken account of
         the provisions of section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and
         Immigration Act 2009. The judge specifically noted that, pursuant
         to regulation 21(3) of the 2006 Regulations, a deportation order
         could only be taken in respect of the claimant on serious grounds
         of public policy or public security. The judge accurately
         summarised the respondent's reasons for deportation contained in
         her three letters. At [41] the judge indicated that the key issue
         in this appeal was whether the deportation of the claimant could be
         justified on serious grounds of public policy and whether the
         decision on grounds of public policy was in accordance with the
         principles set out in regulation 21(5).


      9. From [43] to [60] the judge gave detailed reasons why, in her view,
         the SSHD failed to demonstrate the existence of serious grounds
         sufficient to deport the claimant. The judge took account of the
         relatively low level of offending committed by the claimant in the
         UK, noting that none of his offences had attracted a sentence of
         imprisonment or a suspended sentence of imprisonment. The judge
         additionally took into account the different nature of the
         claimant's offending whilst in the United Kingdom, there being no
         indication that he had been involved in theft or burglary offences.
         The judge noted that the claimant's last period of imprisonment had
         been imposed 13 years previously.


     10. In finding that the decision to deport the claimant was not
         proportionate the judge also took into account the circumstances of
         the claimant's offences in the United Kingdom. The judge found that
         those offences mostly related to possession of drugs and that his
         use of drugs and increased use of alcohol had followed a difficult
         time in his life, namely the breakdown of his relationship with his
         partner and his children. The judge referred to a pre-sentence
         report assessing the claimant as being at medium risk of
         reconviction for drug-related offences but also noting the report's
         finding that his likelihood of reoffending would reduce if he
         continued to refrain from drug and alcohol use and carried on
         receiving support to address his excessive alcohol drinking. The
         judge accepted that the claimant had addressed his offending
         behaviour and addictions and that he was attending an alcohol
         rehabilitation group once a week. The judge was satisfied on the
         evidence before her that the claimant had been in rehabilitation
         since his last conviction and that he had so far been able to
         remain out of trouble.


     11. The judge additionally found that, since October 2015, the claimant
         had an additional and important incentive to stay rehabilitated as
         he was now permitted to have direct supervised contact with his
         children. The judge was satisfied that this was relevant to his
         risk of reoffending and to the proportionality of the deportation
         decision. The judge considered the evidence relating to the
         claimant's children noting that the children were subject to Child
         Protection Plans under the category of Emotional Abuse due to his
         presence in the family and serious concerns over the impact of
         violence towards their mother.  The judge however noted, with
         reference to the Court Order dated 29 October 2015,  that the Local
         Authority was recommending weekly supervised contact between the
         claimant and his children and it had reconsidered its decision to
         begin care proceedings. As the recommendation of weekly supervised
         contact had been authorised by the Court, which would have had the
         children's best interests at its primary consideration, the judge
         was of the view that the County Court was clearly satisfied that it
         was in the children's best interests to have some form of direct
         contact with the claimant. The judge found that if the claimant
         were deported to Poland he would not be able to have direct contact
         with his children owing to the breakdown of his relationship with
         the mother of the children. Given that he had not seen his children
         for over a year and that he was keen to see them again, and given
         his past history, the judge was satisfied that the claimant had
         sufficient incentive to remain rehabilitated and that this was
         likely to reflect on the risk of reoffending in the future.


     12. The judge additionally took into account the fact that the claimant
         had been living in the UK since at least 2009 and had been working
         as a self-employed builder and paying taxes. The judge was
         satisfied that the claimant had integrated into UK society and that
         he had worked whilst being in the UK.


     13. At [57] the judge specifically considered the public interest in
         deporting non-UK citizens who have been convicted of crimes in the
         UK and who were persistent offenders. With reference to the
         different nature of the claimant's offending, the fact that the
         claimant had received only non-custodial sentences in the UK, which
         reflected on the lesser seriousness of his offending, his efforts
         with rehabilitation and the potential loss of direct contact with
         his children, the judge was satisfied that the deportation decision
         was not proportionate. Nor was the judge satisfied that the
         claimant's personal conduct represented a genuine, present and
         sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental
         interests of society. The judge found that the claimant's offending
         was clearly linked to his use of drugs and alcohol, and was
         satisfied that he had appropriately addressed his drug and alcohol
         abuse and that he had an incentive to stay rehabilitated so that he
         could have contact with his children. The judge was further
         satisfied that the claimant's close family ties and integration in
         the UK meant that his prospects of rehabilitation were greater in
         the UK than they were in Poland. The judge acknowledged that the
         claimant had committed multiple offences within a short space of
         time, including offences committed after having had notice of the
         deportation decision, which she accepted showed a lack of respect
         for English law, but she was ultimately satisfied that the claimant
         had now addressed his behaviour and found that he did not have an
         ongoing propensity to reoffend or that he constituted a present and
         sufficiently serious threat to the fundamental interests of
         society.

The grounds of appeal and the Upper Tribunal hearing

     14. The SSHD contended that the judge materially erred in law in three
         ways. The grounds asserted that the judge failed to properly
         analyse the claimant's complete offending, instead reducing it to a
         search for "similar" offending. Noting that the offences committed
         by the claimant in Poland were very serious, the grounds maintained
         that the offending had restarted in the UK and that none of this
         had been properly considered by the judge who focused solely on
         searching for similarity in offences and who misdirected herself by
         not objectively considering the entire offending history. This, it
         was submitted, had impacted upon the finding that the claimant did
         not represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat.
         It was further contended that the judge failed to adequately reason
         why the claimant's rehabilitation meant that the probation services
         assessment that he posed a medium risk of reoffending was offset.
         This was particularly so given that the claimant had continued to
         offend even after he knew of the SSHD's intention to deport him.
         This again was said to have impacted upon the judge's finding that
         the claimant did not represent a genuine, present and sufficiently
         serious threat. It was finally contended that the judge focused
         almost exclusively on the children's best interests when
         considering the issue of proportionality. In so doing it was
         submitted that the judge materially erred by conflating the best
         interests assessment beyond being a primary consideration into
         being the determinative one.


     15. In his focused and succinct submissions Mr Jarvis accepted that the
         First-tier Tribunal decision was thorough. He also accepted that
         the judge had clearly considered the arguments on both sides. He
         nevertheless submitted that the judge placed too great an emphasis
         on the dissimilar nature of the claimant's offending in the UK in
         comparison to his offending in Poland, and that the judge placed
         too great an emphasis on the best interests of the claimant's
         children. Although accepting that the judge had engaged with the
         seriousness of the offences it was submitted that she placed undue
         significance on the position of the claimant's children.


     16. Mr Wilford had produced a helpful rule 24 response which he adopted
         in its entirety. As a result he had no reason to make further oral
         submissions.


     17. Having considered the submissions of both parties I indicated that
         I was not satisfied the First-tier Tribunal judge materially erred
         in law and that I would be dismissing the SSHD's appeal.

Discussion

     18. The first ground of appeal contends that the judge failed to
         properly consider the claimant's complete offending history and
         focused solely on searching for similarities between the claimant's
         offending in Poland and in the UK.


     19. There is no merit in this ground. It is abundantly clear from the
         detailed and well-crafted decision that the judge did take account
         of the claimant's full offending history, including his offending
         in Poland. The judge was clearly aware of the history of the
         claimant's offending in Poland (she outlined it at [4] of her
         decision), and was fully entitled to take into account the
         different nature of the offending (as she did at [46]). It is
         inaccurate to say that the judge focused 'solely' on the nature of
         the offending. At [43] the judge additionally took into account the
         seriousness of the offending in the UK in comparison to the
         offending in Poland. The claimant had never received a custodial
         sentence for the offences committed in the UK. This was a
         significantly relevant factor in determining whether the claimant
         posed a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat to the
         fundamental interests of British society. The judge additionally
         took account of the passage of time since the claimant's last
         custodial sentence (at [46]). The judge found that the claimant's
         offending in the UK followed a difficult time in his life and that
         it could be attributed to the breakdown of his relationship with
         his partner and children. The nature of his offending was linked to
         his misuse of drugs and alcohol. The judge was rationally entitled
         to take into account the different nature of the offending and the
         circumstances that led to his offending, and to conclude that this
         was a relevant factor in determining the risk posed by the
         claimant. It is simply not correct to say that the judge failed to
         analyse the claimant's complete offending history.


     20. The second ground contends that the judge failed to give reasons
         why she rejected the assessment in the pre-sentence report that the
         claimant was of medium risk of re-offending, particular in light of
         the fact that he had continued to offend even after receiving
         notice of the SSHD's intention to deport him.


     21. A judge is not bound by a statistical assessment of a risk of re-
         offending contained in a probation report and has to make an
         overall assessment of the evidence before her relating to such risk
         (Vasconcelos (risk- rehabilitation) [2013] UKUT 00378 (IAC)). The
         judge was aware of the claimant's history of offending, including
         his offending after having received notice of the SSHD's intention
         to deport him (see [60]). The judge did provide reasons for
         departing from the view of the probation officer. At [48] the judge
         noted that, according to the Pre-Sentence Report, the claimant's
         likelihood of re-offending would reduce if he continued to refrain
         from drug and alcohol use and carried on receiving support to
         address his excessive alcohol consumption. At [49] the judge found
         that the claimant was attending an alcohol rehabilitation group
         once a week and that he has been in rehabilitation since his last
         conviction. These were findings reasonably open to the judge. The
         judge additionally found that the claimant's family in the UK would
         provide him with some support for his rehabilitation. At [50] the
         judge additionally relied on the direct supervised contact given to
         the claimant under the Court Order of 29 October 2015 as
         constituting an incentive for him to stay out of trouble. The judge
         was rationally entitled to take account of this factor in departing
         from the assessment in the Pre-Sentence Report. The judge provided
         rational and sustainable reasons for departing from the view of the
         Probation Service. Her decision in this regard is not vitiated by a
         material error of law.


     22. The third ground of appeal contends that the judge's
         proportionality assessment focused almost exclusively on the best
         interests of his children and in so doing turned that factor into a
         determinative issue.


     23. A holistic assessment of the decision indicates that this ground is
         also without merit. In her assessment of the proportionality of the
         deportation decisions the judge demonstrably took account of a
         number of disparate but relevant factors. At [48] and [49] the
         judge took into account, in her assessment of proportionality, the
         nature of the claimant's offending in the UK, the circumstances
         that led to that offending, and gave reasons why she found the
         claimant was unlikely to commit further offences. At [53] the judge
         also took into account the different and less nature of his
         offending in the UK. The judge additionally noted the length of the
         claimant's residence in the UK, his integration into UK society and
         the fact that his prospects for rehabilitation was greater in the
         UK than in Poland (at [56] and [60]). Whilst the judge did attach
         weight to the best interests of the claimant's children in her
         assessment of proportionality, in my judgement she did not turn
         this into a determinative issue.


     24. For the above reasons I am not persuaded that the First-tier
         Tribunal judge's decision contains a material error of law and I
         dismiss the Secretary of State's appeal.
