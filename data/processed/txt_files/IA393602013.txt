Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Steward, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Aspinall, instructed by Abbott Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The respondent, Anwar Sher, was born on 18 April 1979  and  is  a  male
    citizen of Pakistan.  I shall hereafter refer to the respondent as "the
    appellant" and to the Secretary of State as the "respondent"  (as  they
    were before the First-tier Tribunal).

 2. The appellant had entered the United Kingdom in 2005 as a  student  and
    was subsequently granted further periods of leave to  remain  until  28
    January 2013.  Thereafter, he made an application for further leave  to
    remain as a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant.   That  application  was
    refused by the respondent by a decision dated 18 September  2013.   The
    appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  J  D  L  Edwards)
    which, in a determination promulgated on 27 January 2014,  has  allowed
    the appeal to the limited extent that the matter was  remitted  to  the
    respondent for reconsideration  "in  the  light  of  the  material  now
    submitted by the appellant."  The Secretary of State sought  permission
    to appeal which was granted by Judge Pirotta on 12 February 2014.

 3. The appellant's application fell to be considered under paragraph 245DD
    of HC 395 (as  amended).   The  appellant  was  awarded  0  points  for
    Appendix A: Attributes ("applicant has access to funds  as  required").
    The appellant had provided a letter from the National Bank of Pakistan.
     The respondent considered that this was

         not  acceptable  because  it  does  not  explicitly   confirm   the
         institution is regulated by the appropriate regulatory body and  it
         does not include any third party contact information  regarding  Mr
         Ullah [third party].   The  full  address  and  postcode,  landline
         telephone number and any email address as specified under paragraph
         41-SD of the Immigration Rules.

    Further,  the  letter  from  a   Mr   Khan   [the   appellant's   legal
    representative] was not acceptable "because it  does  not  confirm  the
    validity of your signature on the third party declaration."

 4. Further, the respondent considered that the appellant had not  provided
    "any evidence in relation to marketing or advertising  material."   The
    contract provided by the appellant was unacceptable because the  client
    (BS Computers Ltd) had  been  dissolved  in  2010  and  "therefore  the
    contract is not valid as the client no longer exists.  Furthermore, you
    have failed to provide a landline telephone number for  your  clients."
    The notice of refusal recorded that "the decision has been made not  to
    request  additional  documentation  or   exceptionally   consider   the
    application under the provisions  of  paragraph  245AA  as  it  is  not
    anticipated that addressing the omission or error would lead to a grant
    of leave."

 5. The appellant was  awarded  0  points  for  "funds  held  in  regulated
    financial institutions."  The letter reiterates the problems  with  the
    bank letter.  Likewise, the appellant was awarded 0 points  "for  funds
    disposable in the United Kingdom".   Again,  it  was  stated  that  the
    appellant had not been awarded points "under provision (d) in the first
    row of Table 4 of Appendix A ... for having access  to  ï¿½50,000."   The
    appellant was awarded the full requirement of 10  points  for  "English
    language" and "maintenance (funds)".

 6. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, the  Presenting  Officer
    had  submitted  that  "the  evidence  before  [the  Tribunal]  did  not
    establish  the  required  standard  that  the  funds  claimed  by   the
    appellants were genuinely available to him."  Counsel for the appellant
    on that occasion drew the Tribunal's attention to  the  fact  that  the
    appellant had received a letter dated 15 March 2013 from the UK  Border
    Agency.  This letter notified the appellant that, as  from  31  January
    2013, amendments had been  made  to  the  Immigration  Rules  regarding
    entrepreneur migrants.  The letter recorded  that  the  government  had
    made the following changes:

      1) the introduction of a genuine entrepreneur test; and

      2) a new requirement for applicants  to  hold  the  necessary  minimum
         funds or invest them in the business) on an  ongoing  basis  rather
         than solely at the time of the application.

 7. The letter goes on to tell the appellant that  "the  UK  Border  Agency
    will contact you in the coming weeks to advise you  how  these  changes
    will affect your application and what steps (if any) you will  need  to
    take before we make a decision on your application."

 8. It is agreed that no further letter was sent by UK Border Agency to the
    appellant.  Judge Edwards had been persuaded by the argument that, as a
    consequence of not sending a further letter, the respondent  had  acted
    unfairly and not in accordance with the law.  At [24] the judge stated:

         It is unfortunate that the respondent did not contact the appellant
         as was promised in the letter of 15 March  2013,  with  a  view  to
         obtaining any further material required to meet the amended  Rules.
         To that extent, the respondent has acted unfairly  and,  therefore,
         not in accordance with the law.  Thus to the extent that this  case
         must be remitted to the respondent for reconsideration, the  appeal
         must be allowed.

 9. The grounds of appeal submit that the letter of 15 March 2013  did  not
    "impose an obligation upon the Secretary of State to give the applicant
    the opportunity to rectify any defect or inadequacy in the  application
    or the supporting documentation."  The grounds  note  "the  new  Rules"
    referred to in the letter "do not alter the appellant's application".

10. I find that the judge erred in law by allowing the appeal and remitting
    the matter to the Secretary of State.  I acknowledge that the appellant
    may have been left puzzled by the failure of the Home Office  to  write
    to him again but it will have become clear to the appellant,  when  his
    application was refused, that  the  changes  in  the  Rules  which  are
    detailed in the letter of 15 March 2013 had no impact at all  upon  the
    outcome of his application.  As I have recorded above,  the  supporting
    documentation supplied by the appellant with  his  application  to  the
    respondent  simply  did  not  comply  with  the  requirements  of   the
    Immigration  Rules.   The  UK  Border  Agency  letter  refers  only  to
    contacting the  appellant  again  to  advise  "how  these  changes  [my
    emphasis] might affect the application; the fact is those changes  (see
    [6] above) did not affect the application in any  way.   Judge  Edwards
    has, in effect, remitted the matter to the Secretary of State to  carry
    out an entirely pointless exercise, i.e. reconsidering the  appellant's
    application (which was bound to fail in any event) in the light of  the
    changes to the Rules.

11. Ms Aspinall, for the appellant, sought to  widen  the  argument  whilst
    seeking to rely upon the evidential flexibility policy in force at  the
    time of the appellant's application.  Both Ms Aspinall and Mr  Steward,
    for the respondent, agreed that the application  was  covered  by  that
    policy which appears as Appendix B in the determination  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Rodrigues (Flexibility Policy) [2013] UKUT 00042 (IAC).  Ms
    Aspinall  submitted  that,  whilst  the  documents  submitted  by   the
    appellant might be deficient for the  reasons  stated  in  the  refusal
    notice (see above), the information which was absent appeared in  other
    documents submitted by the appellant with his application.   This,  she
    submitted, should have alerted the Secretary  of  State  to  apply  the
    flexibility policy and to, in  effect,  put  together  or  collate  the
    various items of  documentary  evidence  to  enable  the  appellant  to
    satisfy the Rule accordingly.  In her skeleton  argument,  she  submits
    also that the "defects identified in the refusal letter are  minor  and
    relate to details which could easily have  been  rectified  should  the
    appellant have applied its evidential flexibility policy."

12. I reject those submissions.  If the Rules require specific  information
    on a  single  document,  the  requirements  are  not  satisfied  by  an
    applicant providing the information  spread  across  several  different
    documents.  I find that there was no obligation upon the  Secretary  of
    State to collate information from several documents.  Further, the fact
    that the required information appeared on  several  documents  did  not
    necessarily  indicate  that  there  existed  a  single  document  which
    contained all the necessary information.  Indeed, had there been such a
    document one would have expected the appellant  to  have  produced  it.
    There was nothing to  alert  the  Secretary  of  State,  therefore,  to
    enquire about such a missing document  under  the  flexibility  policy.
    Further, there is nothing in the flexibility policy  to  indicate  that
    the Secretary of State should overlook minor failures on  the  part  of
    the applicant to comply with the Rules.

13. The appellant also seeks to rely  upon  Naved  (Student  -  fairness  -
    notice of points) [2012] UKUT 14 (IAC).  The headnote reads as follows:

         Fairness requires the Secretary of State to give  an  applicant  an
         opportunity to address grounds for refusal, which he did  not  know
         and could not have known, failing which the resulting decision  may
         be set aside on appeal as contrary to the law (without contravening
         the provisions of  Section  85A  of  the  Nationality,  Asylum  and
         Immigration Act 2002)

14. There was no suggestion in the present appeal that the reasons given by
    the Secretary of State for refusing the  appellant's  application  were
    not known or could not have been known by the appellant.  The appellant
    had, put simply, produced supporting evidence which he knew  or  should
    have known failed to comply with the Immigration Rules in force at  the
    time he made his application.

15. In the circumstances, I find the First-tier determination should be set
    aside.  I have remade the decision.   The  appeal  in  respect  of  the
    Immigration Rules is dismissed.  The grounds of appeal  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal [5] raise Article 8 ECHR but do no more than assert  that
    the appellant had "developed a private life in  the  UK."   No  further
    evidence in relation to Article 8 has been  adduced.   I  am  satisfied
    that  the  immigration  decision  in  this  instance   represents   the
    legitimate aim of the Secretary of State in  maintaining  a  system  of
    immigration control and that there is no evidence whatever to show that
    the immigration decision will cause  disproportionate  interference  to
    the appellant's private life.

DECISION

16. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 27  January
    2014 is set aside.  I have remade the decision.  The appeal in  respect
    of the Immigration Rules is dismissed.   The  appeal  is  dismissed  on
    human rights grounds (Article 8 ECHR).
