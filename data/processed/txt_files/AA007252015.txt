For the Appellant:     Mr Kandola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr James Collins, instructed by Sentinal Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1     This is an appeal brought by the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department. In this decision, I shall refer to the parties as they were
    in the First tier, i.e. that Mohamed Osman is the  Appellant,  and  the
    Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  is  the  Respondent.  The
    Respondent appeals against the decision  of  the  First  tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Munonyedi) dated 26 May 2015, allowing  the  Appellant's  appeal
    against the Respondent's  decision  of  5  January  2015  refusing  his
    application for asylum.

2     The Appellant's date of birth is 1 July 1994 and is 21 years old.  His
    account was, in summary, that he is a Somali national of Shanshia, Reer
    Hamar minority clan origin. He  lived with  his  parents  in  Mogadishu
    until the age of 6 at which time the Appellant's  family  left  Somalia
    and the Appellant was left with an 'uncle' and his  children.   I  note
    that this was not in fact a sibling of the Appellant's  father,  but  a
    more distant relative (SEF q 18). The uncle's  household  suffered  two
    major attacks; in 2011, when Al-Shabaab broke into the home, killed the
    uncle's son, raped his two daughters, and  assaulted  and  injured  the
    Appellant (see decision [10], and SEF q 40); and  further,  in  October
    2013, an armed gang entered the home demanding money, and kidnapped the
    uncle's two daughters.

3      The  Respondent  has  throughout  accepted  the  Appellant's  claimed
    nationality and minority clan membership (refusal, paras 17-21 and 31).
    However, the Respondent declined to give the Appellant 'the benefit  of
    the doubt' (para 28) in relation to the Appellant's account of the  two
    attacks. The Respondent's reasons for this appear to be  that  (i)  the
    Appellant had not provided any medical  evidence  in  relation  to  his
    injuries in 2011; (ii) the attacks were  random  acts  carried  out  by
    different groups; (iii) the groups did not return to  the  property  or
    pose any further threat; (iv)  after  the  second  attack  in  February
    2013[1], the Appellant did not leave until 8 months  later;  (v)  there
    was no evidence to  prove  that  the  attacks  occurred;  and  (v)  the
    Appellant had not claimed asylum in Greece when he was there  (refusal,
    paras 25 and 28).

4     Further, the Respondent refused the Appellant's asylum  claim  on  the
    basis that following MOJ & Ors (Return to Mogadishu) [2014] UKUT  00442
    (IAC) ('MOJ')  there was no longer  any  risk  of  persecution  of  the
    Appellant as a minority clan member (refusal, para  34)  and  that  the
    Appellant  would  not  face  the  prospect  of  living   in   destitute
    circumstances that would engage the UK's obligations under the  Refugee
    Convention or ECHR (refusal para 40).

5     In the subsequent appeal, Judge  Munonyedi  accepted  the  Appellant's
    account was consistent and unexaggerated; it addressed  the  issues  in
    the Respondent's refusal letter in a manner which  was  convincing  and
    reasonable. The Appellant's core claims were reasonably  likely  to  be
    true; he was credible and truthful  [15]-[16].  Notably,  there  is  no
    challenge from the Respondent to that assessment.

6     Even though  the  Judge  accepted  the  Appellant's  account  of  past
    persecution, she found at para 22 that the risk of similar harm had now
    receded. However, the Judge considered the evidence as to  the  whether
    the Appellant retained any 'nuclear family' in  Mogadishu;  a  relevant
    issue following MOJ. The Judge made the following findings in  relation
    to that issue in her decision:

         "25.     ... Since leaving Somalia in February 2014, the  Appellant
         nor his family in the United Kingdom have had any contact with  his
         uncle. They do not know where he is or whether or not he is alive.

         ...

         27.      It is my finding that the Appellant  as  a  minority  clan
         member would find it very difficult, almost impossible to access  a
         livelihood without the support of clan or  nuclear  family  despite
         the apparent economic boom in Somalia.

         ...

         31.      It is my finding that the appellant  without  any  nuclear
         family support will find it impossible to establish  himself.   His
         minority clan membership means that he does not have the important,
         influential and significant support network that he would  need  to
         establish  himself  in  Mogadishu.  The   appellant   has   already
         experienced discrimination because  of  his  clan  membership.  His
         physical appearance and light coloured skin  makes  it  very  clear
         that he is from a minority clan. Without the means  of  support  he
         would be left destitute and forced to an IDP camp. It is my finding
         that life in such a camp falls well below  acceptable  humanitarian
         standards.

         32.      The means for the appellant to leave Somalia were  met  by
         his Uncle. The appellant and his family have  not  heard  from  his
         since February 2014."

7     The Judge's ultimate decision was that the Appellant's  appeal  should
    be allowed on humanitarian protection  grounds,  and  on  human  rights
    grounds.

8     The Respondent sought permission to appeal in Grounds of Appeal  dated
    10 June 2015 which argue, in summary, that the Judge erred in law in:

         (i)      failing to 'resolve the  evidence'  within  paragraph  27;
             speculating that  the  Appellant's  uncle  was  no  longer  in
             Mogadishu or had died, as it was probable that he was still in
             Mogadishu; having no contact with him did not  equate  to  his
             having left or died; and

         (ii)     failing to  consider  the  effect  of  the  re-integration
             package offered to failed asylum seekers which  would  furnish
             the Appellant with the financial means to re-establish himself
             in Somalia.

9     Permission to appeal was granted on 25 June 2015 on those grounds.

10    I note that both Judge Munonyedi (at her para  [10])  and  Judge  Reid
    (at his para 3), in his subsequent  decision  granting  the  Respondent
    permission to appeal against  Judge  Munonyedi's  decision,  appear  to
    misapprehended the dates of the Appellant's departures  (pleural)  from
    Somalia. The Appellant's evidence was not, as suggested by the  Judges,
    that he first left Somalia in 2011 after the first attack; rather,  his
    uncle facilitated his departure to Greece  in  'the  tenth  month'  (ie
    October) of  2013 after the second attack (SEF  q  90,  99),  where  he
    remained for  2  months  and  was  detained  for  2  weeks  (screening,
    continuation sheet; SEF q 91),  and  was  fingerprinted  (screening,  q
    2.13), before returning to Somalia (SEF q 94).  The  uncle  then  again
    arranged for the Appellant to leave Somalia, this  time  travelling  to
    Kenya in the 'second month' (ie February) of 2014 (SEF q 77 -79), where
    the Appellant stayed for a week, and then flew to the UK,  arriving  11
    February 2014 (see screening, 2.1).

11    I do not find that his misapprehension makes any  material  difference
    to the Judge's positive finding on credibility. A mistake of  fact  may
    give rise to an error of law if it results in unfairness  to  a  party.
    However, the Respondent in her grounds of appeal does not identify this
    issue at all, and hence has not argued that she  has  been  caused  any
    unfairness as a result of any misapprehension on the part of the  Judge
    in relation to the timing of the Appellant's departures  from  Somalia.
    In any event, the Respondent and the FtT were  always  aware  that  the
    Appellant had twice departed.

    The hearing

12    I heard submissions  from  the  parties.  Mr  Kandola  relied  on  the
    grounds of appeal.

13    In relation to the Respondent's point regarding the  adequacy  of  the
    Judge's reasoning in finding that the Appellant had no  nuclear  family
    in Mogadishu, I drew Mr Kandola's attention to the Appellant's evidence
    at q 113-4 of the SEF interview  (which  must,  in  the  light  of  the
    Judge's comprehensive finding as to the Appellant's credibility at [15]-
    [16], be deemed to be true), which reads as follows:

         "Q113: Where is your uncle?

         A: I don't know.

         Q114: How do you know he is not there anymore?

         A: He told me before leaving he was ready to leave the country once
         his daughters return and he also mentioned we'll see each other  in
         Kenya."

14    Mr Kandola argued that even in the light of that  evidence  the  Judge
    was still obliged to provide greater reasoning than  she  had  done  in
    arriving at the conclusion that the Appellant had no nuclear family  in
    Mogadishu.

15    In relation to the second ground, Ms Kandola handed up and  sought  to
    rely on a 2 page document from  'Horizon,  the  Home  Office  intranet'
    entitled 'VARRP assistance'. This relates  to  the  Voluntary  Assisted
    Return and Reintegration Programme. The document was  not  specific  to
    Somalia. It provided that:

         "Choices will:

           . help the applicant get travel documentation, if needed

           . arrange and pay for flights

           . arrange transport to the UK departure airport, if needed

           . give assistance at the departure airport, if needed

           . arrange onward transport, if needed, when back in the  country
             of origin  or  the  third  country  to  which  the  person  is
             permanently admissible (country of return)

         Those who return under VARRP are eligible for up to �1,500 worth of
         reintegration  assistance  for  each  person,  including   a   �500
         relocation grant in cash on departure  for  immediate  resettlement
         needs

         Once  home,  a  range  of  reintegration  assistance  options   are
         available,  tailored  to  the  returnee's  individual  needs.  This
         assistance is to help  returnees  to  make  an  income  and  become
         financially independent. To take up this part of the  reintegration
         assistance, returnees must contact  Choices  within  one  month  of
         their return. All reintegration assistance is supplied  within  the
         first six months of return.

         Reintegration assistance can be used for any of the following:

           . business set-up

           . education

           . vocational training

           . job placement

           . housing (temporary accommodation or for repair work)

           . childcare fees, or

           . medical and psychosocial support."

16    The second page of the document sets out who  may  be  eligible.  This
    includes a person who "... has been refused asylum  and  has  exhausted
    the appeals process", and so would  appear,  contrary  to  Mr  Collins'
    submission on the point, at least potentially to apply to the Appellant
    if his present appeal failed,  although I note this eligibility  ceases
    to apply if a  person  is  detained  or  has  removal  directions  set.
    Further, "In  each  individual  case,  applications  are  received  and
    screened  by  Choices.  The  final  decision   about   suitability   of
    applications for  the  programme  rests  with  the  assisted  voluntary
    returns (AVR) team".

17    I sought to clarify with the parties whether  this  specific  document
    had been before the FtT Judge. Mr Kandola  accepted  that  it  had  not
    been, but the package had been  referred  to  within  the  Respondent's
    decision letter of 5 January 2015.

18    I asked the parties whether the terms of the VARRP scheme had  been  a
    matter considered by the Upper Tribunal in the  case  of  MOJ.  Neither
    party brought any particular extract of the decision to my attention.

19    Mr Collins resisted the appeal on the grounds, in  summary,  that  the
    FtT Judge had made findings as to whether the Appellant had  a  nuclear
    family in Mogadishu which were open  to  her  and  were  based  on  the
    evidence, including the evidence at q 114 of the  SEF  which  indicated
    that the uncle had plans to leave Mogadishu himself as soon as he could
    in any event. Further, the VARRP document was not before  the  FtT  and
    the Respondent's present attempt to rely on it  did  not  disclose  any
    material error of law.





    Discussion

    The nuclear family issue

20    This appeal requires consideration of the country  guidance  given  in
    MOJ, the headnote of which (which is derived from the text of para  407
    of the  decision) is as follows (insofar as is relevant):

         "(vii)   A person returning to Mogadishu after a period of  absence
              will look to his nuclear family, if he has one living in  the
              city, for assistance in re-establishing himself and  securing
              a livelihood. Although a returnee may  also  seek  assistance
              from his clan members who are not close relatives, such  help
              is only likely to be forthcoming for majority  clan  members,
              as minority clans may have little to offer.

         (viii)   The significance  of  clan  membership  in  Mogadishu  has
              changed.  Clans  now  provide,  potentially,  social  support
              mechanisms and assist with access to livelihoods,  performing
              less of a protection function than previously. There  are  no
              clan militias in Mogadishu, no clan  violence,  and  no  clan
              based  discriminatory  treatment,  even  for  minority   clan
              members.

         (ix)     If it is  accepted  that  a  person  facing  a  return  to
              Mogadishu after a period of absence has no nuclear family  or
              close relatives in the city to assist him in  re-establishing
              himself on return, there will need to be a careful assessment
              of  all  of  the  circumstances.  These  considerations  will
              include, but are not limited to:

                 . circumstances in Mogadishu before departure;

                 . length of absence from Mogadishu;

                 . family or clan associations to call upon in Mogadishu;

                 . access to financial resources;

                 . prospects of  securing  a  livelihood,  whether  that  be
                   employment or  self employment;

                 . availability of remittances from abroad;

                 . means of support during the  time  spent  in  the  United
                   Kingdom;

                 . why his ability to fund the journey to the West no longer
                   enables an  appellant  to  secure  financial  support  on
                   return.

         (x)      Put another way, it will be for the person  facing  return
              to explain why he would not be able to  access  the  economic
              opportunities that have been produced by the  economic  boom,
              especially as there is evidence to the effect that  returnees
              are taking jobs at the expense of those who have  never  been
              away.

         (xi)     It will, therefore, only be those with no clan  or  family
              support who will not be in receipt of remittances from abroad
              and who have  no  real  prospect  of  securing  access  to  a
              livelihood on return who will face the prospect of living  in
              circumstances falling  below  that  which  is  acceptable  in
              humanitarian protection terms.

         (xii)    The evidence indicates clearly that it is not simply those
              who originate from Mogadishu that may now generally return to
              live in the city without being subjected to an Article  15(c)
              risk or facing a real risk of destitution. On the other hand,
              relocation in Mogadishu for a person of a minority clan  with
              no former links to the city, no access to funds and no  other
              form of clan, family or social  support  is  unlikely  to  be
              realistic as, in the absence of means to establish a home and
              some form of ongoing financial support there will be  a  real
              risk of having  no  alternative  but  to  live  in  makeshift
              accommodation within an  IDP  camp  where  there  is  a  real
              possibility of having to live in conditions  that  will  fall
              below acceptable humanitarian standards."

21    I am of the view that the Respondent's challenge is, at  its  core,  a
    reasons challenge: ie the Judge did not provide adequate reasoning  for
    finding that the Appellant had no nuclear family support in  Mogadishu.
    I am also of the view that it is appropriate to consider to what extent
    this issue was actually raised by the Respondent in the refusal  letter
    at all: where an issue is clearly raised by a party to an  appeal,  the
    Tribunal will be required to resolve that issue, with reasons which are
    adequate to the particular context; conversely, where an issue  is  not
    raised or raised only obliquely, public law does not require  extensive
    reasons to be given to make a finding on such an issue.  I  refer,  for
    example, to the headnote of Budhathoki (reasons for  decisions)  [2014]
    UKUT 341 (IAC) (1 July 2014):

         "It is generally unnecessary and unhelpful for First-tier  Tribunal
         judgments to rehearse every detail or issue raised in a case.  This
         leads to judgments becoming overly long and confused and is  not  a
         proportionate approach to deciding cases. It is, however, necessary
         for judges to identify and resolve key conflicts  in  the  evidence
         and explain in clear and brief terms their  reasons,  so  that  the
         parties can understand why they have won or lost."

22    With those principles  in  mind,  I  note  that  in  the  Respondent's
    refusal letter of 5 January 2015 states as follows:

         "35.     However, it is noted that you  claim  to  have  no  family
         remaining in Somalia (Q112) and therefore  consideration  has  been
         given to  you  as  an  individual  returning  to  Somalia  with  no
         relatives in the City."

23    I have already set out at para 3 above, the Respondent's  reasons  for
    not extending the 'benefit of the doubt'  to  the  Appellant's  account
    regarding the two attacks.

24    One can therefore see that the Respondent  did  not  in  fact  dispute
    within the refusal letter the Appellant's claim that he was  no  longer
    in contact with his uncle, and that he did not know where he  was.  The
    Appellant's claim  was  considered  on  the  basis  that  he  would  be
    returning to a city where he had no relatives.

25    I also observe that at paragraph 406 of MOJ,  immediately  before  the
    passage at 407 (quoted at my paragraph 20 above),  the  Upper  Tribunal
    held as follows:

         "406.    We consider, it the light of the evidence as a whole, that
         the position as set out by UNHCR in  its  report  published  on  25
         September 2013 continues to reflect an appropriate  starting  point
         today, upon which to build in the light of our review of the up  to
         date evidence:

             "With regard to Mogadishu , the personal circumstances  of  an
             individual need to be carefully assessed. UNHCR  considers  an
             IFA/IRA as reasonable only where the individual can expect  to
             benefit from meaningful nuclear and/or extended family support
             and clan protection mechanisms  in  the  area  of  prospective
             relocation. When assessing the reasonableness of an IFA/IRA in
             Mogadishu in an individual case, it should  be  kept  in  mind
             that the traditional extended family and community  structures
             of Somali society no longer constitute as strong a  protection
             and coping mechanism in Mogadishu as they  did  in  the  past.
             Additionally, whether the members of the traditional  networks
             are able to  genuinely  offer  support  to  the  applicant  in
             practice also needs to  be  evaluated,  especially  given  the
             fragile and complex situation in Mogadishu at present.

             For the following categories of Somalis, UNHCR would  consider
             that an IFA/IRA  will  not  be  reasonably  available  in  the
             absence of meaningful nuclear and/or extended  family  support
             and functioning clan  protection:  unaccompanied  children  or
             adolescents at risk of  forced  recruitment  and  other  grave
             violations; young males at risk of being considered Al Shabaab
             sympathizers and therefore facing harassment  from  government
             security forces;  elderly  people;  people  with  physical  or
             mental disabilities; single women and female single  heads  of
             households with no male protection and especially  originating
             from minority clans. In any other exceptional cases, in  which
             the application of an IFA/IRA in Mogadishu is considered  even
             in the absence of meaningful family or  clan  support  to  the
             individual,  the  person  would  need  to   have   access   to
             infrastructure  and  livelihood  opportunities  and  to  other
             meaningful protection  and  support  mechanisms,  taking  into
             account the state institutions'  limited  ability  to  provide
             security and meaningful protection." (Emphasis added)

26    MOJ requires a decision-maker to consider the potential support  to  a
    returnee from a nuclear family. The Upper Tribunal also  considered  at
    para 406 the UNHCR report of 23 September 2013  to  be  an  appropriate
    starting point, which referred to 'meaningful' nuclear and/or  extended
    family support. One cannot sensibly interpret the remainder of  MOJ  as
    suggesting that anything less than meaningful support  from  a  nuclear
    family would be likely to avail a returnee.  If  such  support  is  not
    meaningful, it is meaningless.

27    Bearing in mind that:

    (i)    the only family that the Respondent refers to in her grounds  of
         appeal as being  potentially  relevant  is  a  single  person;  the
         Appellant's uncle (a distant relative, not a paternal uncle), and I
         query how 'meaningful' the presence of a single person might be  in
         any event, or whether he could be deemed to  represent  a  'nuclear
         family';

    (ii)   that uncle had lost his own son,  and  his  daughters  had  been
         raped and later kidnapped, and was  considering  leaving  Mogadishu
         whenever he could;

    (iii)  15 months had passed between the Appellant last leaving Somalia,
         and the FtT hearing;

    (iv)   the Respondent had not raised  within  the  refusal  letter  the
         potential presence of the uncle  as  a  relevant  consideration  as
         defeating the Appellant's protection claim;

    I conclude that the FtT was  entirely  justified  in  arriving  at  the
    finding that the Appellant had no nuclear family support  available  to
    him on return, and its reasons were adequate in law, in the  particular
    context of this appeal and in relation to the  key  issues  in  dispute
    between the parties.

    The VARRP issue

28    I consider  the  relevance  of  the  Respondent's  'Horizon'  intranet
    document at para 38 below.

29    However, I consider the degree to which the VARRP issue was raised  in
    the Respondent's original refusal letter of 5 January 2015. The  letter
    is essentially in two parts. Pages 1-2 (of  11)  are  entitled  'Asylum
    Decision', and: informs the Appellant that he has been  refused  asylum
    for reasons set out in 'Annex A' to  the  letter;  gives  advice  about
    rights of appeal; provides the Appellant with a one-stop notice  (under
    s.120 NIAA 2002); and then states as follows:

         "Refugee Action - Choices assisted Voluntary Returns Service

         Refugee Action assist people to return to their own  country.  They
         are an independent charity are and not part of the  United  Kingdom
         Government.   Through   'Choices',   Refugee   Action's   Voluntary
         Assistance Return and  Reintegration  Programme  (VARRP),  you  can
         apply for Reintegration Assistance where you  can  benefit  from  a
         small business start up, job training,  job  placements,  education
         courses  and  vocational  training.  Additionally  Refugee   Action
         provide a relocation grant and baggage allowance and can help  with
         temporary accommodation and childcare.

         Refugee Action offer independent,  confidential  and  non-directive
         advice so that you can make an  informed  decision  on  whether  to
         return home.  Please  find  enclosed  the  leaflets  regarding  the
         Voluntary Return and VARRP."

30    I am not provided with copies of any leaflets.

31    The remainder of the refusal letter, pages 3-11, is 'Annex A', and  is
    entitled "Detailed Reasons for Refusal". There is no reference  to  the
    VARRP Service in Annex A. There is a passage which as follows at [38]:

         "38.     It is also noted that within Mogadishu, there are a number
         of resources that would be available to you. For example, the  2015
         UNHCR country operation profile states that improvements are  being
         made for returning refugees and assistance to reintegrate returnees
         in Somalia;

             '(With hopes of g[2])reater stability in  Somalia,  some  IDPs
             refugees  from  neighbouring   countries   are   spontaneously
             returning to their areas  of  origin.  UNHCR  has  formed  the
             Return Consortium, consisting of UN agencies and international
             NGOs  in  Somalia.  The  consortium  promotes  a  standardized
             approach to assist returnees and seeks synergies to facilitate
             voluntary  return,  with  the  aim  of  safe  and  sustainable
             reintegration of returnees in Somalia.

             The Office will carry out its mandate and implement its return
             strategy in cooperation with the Government and members of the
             Return Consortium. While it is acknowledged that this  process
             will take some time to bear fruit, as the overall situation is
             not yet ripe for  solutions,  UNHCR  will  fully  explore  all
             existing or emerging opportunities.

             Activities will focus on supporting the  return  of  IDPs  and
             refugees to their areas of origin, while also  pursuing  local
             integration  where  feasible.  The   Office   will   implement
             reintegration  activities  through  community-based   projects
             benefitting  both   returnees   and   host   communities,   in
             coordination with development actors.

             Since 2012, there has been a steady increase  in  needs  as  a
             result of the growing number of IDPs. In 2015,  the  financial
             requirements for UNHCR's operation in Somalia are set  at  USD
             79.3 million, approximately USD 10 million more than the  2014
             budget. This increase reflects durable solutions  requirements
             of  IDPs  and  refugees,  including  for  return   and   local
             integration.' "

32    I mention above  that  neither  party  brought  to  my  attention  any
    passage within MOJ relevant to the VARRP issue. In fact, the  following
    passages are relevant. At para 239, the  Upper  Tribunal  set  out  the
    Respondent's submissions in MOJ as follows:

         "239.    Finally, in terms of general submissions,  the  respondent
         points to financial support  provided  to  returnees  by  the  Home
         Office in terms of reintegration support. Voluntary  returnees  can
         benefit from a package of a grant of up to �1,500  which  might  be
         used to start a small  business  as  well  as  support  from  local
         caseworkers. Although the Tribunal in AMM were not  persuaded  that
         would make a  significant  difference,  that  was  because  of  the
         conditions as they were then found to be.  Now  that  the  complete
         withdrawal of Al Shabaab has been maintained and there is no longer
         any conventional fighting, the position is, the respondent submits,
         very different."

33    The Upper Tribunal in  MOJ  made  the  following  observation  in  its
    section on IDP's at paras 409-423:

         "423.     Two  observations   might   be   made   about   financial
         considerations. Financial assistance from the Home  Office  may  be
         available to voluntary returnees, in the form of a grant of  up  to
         �1,500, and may (be) of significant assistance to a returnee."

34    I find that the issue of the potential availability  of  financial  or
    other  assistance  to  the  Appellant  through  VARRP,  as  potentially
    diminishing his chances  of  becoming  destitute,  was  simply  not  an
    element of the Respondent's case that was properly put in issue in  the
    appeal before the FtT. Although the existence, in general terms, of the
    VARRP programme was something  brought  to  the  Appellant's  attention
    within pages 1-2 of the refusal letter,  no  particulars  of  any  such
    support were set out in that section of the refusal, or thereafter.  No
    cash  sum,  whether  �500,  or  �1500,  was  mentioned.  Nor  were  any
    particulars set out as to how the scheme actually operated in Mogadishu
    or anywhere else in Somalia. No particulars were  provided  as  to  the
    availability,  in  Mogadishu,   of:   internal   travel   arrangements,
    education,  vocational  training,  job  placement,   housing   (whether
    temporary accommodation or for repair work); payment of childcare fees;
     or the availability of medical and/or psychosocial support.

35    Further, it is clear from the structure of  the  refusal  letter  that
    the actual reasons being relied on by the Respondent  for refusing  the
    asylum claim are contained within Annex A, the  'Detailed  reasons  for
    refusal', in  which  section  VARRP  is  not  mentioned.  Further,  the
    Respondent cannot possibly argue that a matter is properly put in issue
    by reference to the  contents  of  leaflets,  which  are  even  further
    removed from the content of the 'Detailed reasons for refusal', and the
    contents of which we have no idea.

36    The existence of the  'Return  Consortium',  referred  to  within  the
    UNHCR document quoted at para 38 of the refusal is not a matter  raised
    in the Respondent's grounds of appeal, and  the  Respondent  raises  no
    complaint about the FtT not referring to it in the  decision.   In  any
    event, the UNHCR document is rather aspirational as to  the  assistance
    hoped to be provided to returnees; solutions are not 'ripe', and it  is
    clear from the  last  paragraph  that  the  financial  requirements  of
    returnees exceed the available budget.

37    The Respondent could have raised the VARRP issue  clearly  within  the
    detailed reasons for refusal, and given details as to  how  the  scheme
    operated in Mogadishu. However, she did not.

38    I find that the Horizon intranet document, seeking to provide  further
    particulars of the VARRP scheme, is  clearly  evidence  which  was  not
    before the FtT. The Respondent's reference  to  the  contents  of  that
    document now does not establish any material error of  law  within  the
    FtT's decision, made as it was on (i) the issues in dispute before  it,
    and (ii) the evidence before it. Although  clearly  I  have   read  the
    document, its contents have no relevance to the question of whether the
    FtT erred in law.

39    With the VARRP matter not being  properly  raised  in  the  particular
    decision served on the  Appellant,  should  the  issue  be  treated  as
    generally raised in all Somalia appeals, on the basis  that  it  is  an
    issue which is discussed in MOJ?

40    I am not satisfied that  the  existence  of  the  VARRP  scheme  is  a
    constituent element of the Country Guidance given in MOJ.  The decision
    is 481 paragraphs long, excluding its Annexes, and  clearly  not  every
    enunciation of the Tribunal  within  the  body  of  the  decision  will
    represent Country  Guidance.  I  find  that  the  Country  Guidance  is
    contained at paragraph 407, which is  repeated  accurately  within  the
    headnote. The Upper Tribunal has no doubt been astute  to  ensure  that
    country guidance purportedly  set  out  within  a  headnote  accurately
    reflects the country guidance actually given within  the  body  of  the
    decision, given the Court of Appeal's criticisms of the Upper  Tribunal
    in PO (Nigeria) v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 132, para 37.

41     I  therefore  find  that  the  potential  availability  of  financial
    assistance from VARRP, as a matter potentially reducing the risk of the
    Appellant becoming destitute, was simply not part of  the  Respondent's
    case before the FtT, and hence the FtT was not required to address  the
    issue. The absence of any reference to VARRP within the FtT's  decision
    does not disclose any material error of law.

42    If I am wrong in respect of either of  my  assessments  that  (i)  the
    Respondent's decision letter in the present case decision did not raise
    the VARRP point, and (ii) the case of MOJ does not  require  the  VARRP
    point to be addressed in every Somali appeal, I find  nonetheless  that
    the FtT's lack of reference to VARRP does  not  disclose  any  material
    error of law in the present case. I so find on the basis that  the  FtT
    would, for the present Appellant, have inevitably have come to the same
    conclusion, that the Appellant would end  up  destitute  in  conditions
    well below acceptable humanitarian standards (para 32).

43    The Appellant, on findings which I find above to be  sustainable,  has
    no one in Somalia. The Upper Tribunal in   AMM  and  others  (conflict;
    humanitarian crisis; returnees; FGM) Somalia CG [2011] UKUT  445  (IAC)
    (28 November 2011) held:

         "347.    As part of the holistic assessment we  must  make,  regard
         clearly has to  be  had  to  the  current  humanitarian  crisis  in
         Mogadishu. The most recent evidence  includes  the  declaration  of
         famine  in  the  IDP  camps  located  in  the  city.  Although  the
         distribution of food is proceeding in a commendable fashion,  there
         are still serious problems regarding malnutrition and  disease,  as
         well as gross overcrowding. These factors  bear  on  Article  15(c)
         risk in two ways. First, they make it  impossible  to  find,  as  a
         general matter, that someone involuntarily returned to Mogadishu is
         not at risk of ending up in one of the districts where conventional
         (in any event, significant) fighting is still occurring. Second, as
         regards all but the  better-off  or  best-protected  citizens,  the
         direct and indirect effects of the humanitarian crisis  are  likely
         to be such as to diminish their capacity for vigilance, as  regards
         such things as IEDs, unexploded ordinance, opportunistic  criminals
         and continuing Al-Shabab  elements  intent  on  spreading  fear  by
         intimidation, kidnapping and beheading.

         348.      We  are  conscious  of  the  evidence,  disputed  by  the
         appellants, that returnees from the United Kingdom may be given  up
         to �1,500 by the United Kingdom in order to assist resettlement and
         reintegration. We are, however, unable to find that  a  person  who
         stands to get such funds will thereby be able, as a general matter,
         to surmount the problems we have just mentioned, at  least  in  all
         but the immediate term."

44    MOJ observes that there have been improvements  in  county  conditions
    in Somalia since AMM was decided.  The  categories  of  persons  deemed
    likely to end up in an IDP camp in  conditions  in  breach  of  Article
    15(c) of the Qualification Directive have been  reduced.  However,  the
    Appellant, according to his profile, still faces such a risk.  Even  if
    (in the absence of the VARRP issue being properly raised in the refusal
    letter  in  the  present  case)  the  FtT  was  obliged  to  take   the
    Respondent's assertions at para 239 of MOJ into account, and  ought  to
    have considered that the Appellant  may  potentially  benefit  from  'a
    package of a grant of up to �1,500', I find that, as the Appellant is a
    minority clan member with no nuclear family available to  support  him,
    the FtT would still inevitably have arrived at the same  conclusion  as
    did the Upper Tribunal in AMM, ie that such assistance would enable him
    to escape his probable destitution only in the immediate term.

45    In any event, even if I were to set aside the FtT's  decision  on  the
    basis that it had materially erred in law by failing to have regard  to
    the availability of the VARRP programme, and if I  were  to  admit  and
    take into account the Respondent's Horizon intranet document, it  would
    then become apparent that the  way  in  which  the  VARRP  package  was
    described at para 239 of MOJ was not accurate. Insofar as it  suggested
    that �1500 cash was available, it is clear from  the  Horizon  document
    that it is not. Cash is limited to �500. The Horizon document  provides
    that an applicant 'may apply' to the scheme; assistance is said  to  be
    'up to' �1,500 'worth' of reintegration assistance; any  package  lasts
    only 6 months; and, as observed above, even  taking  into  account  the
    greater particularity within the Horizon document  of  how  the  scheme
    works (compared with the more general observations set out at para  239
    of MOJ), the Horizon document still provides no particulars as  to  how
    the scheme actually operates in Mogadishu or anywhere else in  Somalia:
    no particulars were provided as to the availability, in Mogadishu,  of:
    internal  travel  arrangements,  education,  vocational  training,  job
    placement, housing  (whether  temporary  accommodation  or  for  repair
    work); payment of childcare  fees;   or  the  availability  of  medical
    and/or psychosocial support.

46    If required to remake the decision, I  would  hold  that  the  Horizon
    document contains no particulars as to how the VARRP scheme operates in
    Somalia. Further, I would hold that the  �500  cash  funds  potentially
    available to the Appellant would not materially reduce  the  likelihood
    of the Appellant,  a  minority  clan  member  with  no  nuclear  family
    available in Mogadishu to support him,  of  becoming  destitute,  to  a
    level below a reasonable degree of likelihood.

    Decision

47    The FtT's decision did not involve the making of any error of law.

    I do not set aside the FtT's decision.
