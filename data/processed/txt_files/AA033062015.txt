                         DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


  1. This is an appeal against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge N  M
     Paul (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  judge),  promulgated  on  11
     February 2016, dismissing the appellant's appeal against a decision to
     refuse to grant him asylum.  Permission to appeal was granted by Upper
     Tribunal Judge Plimmer.



                          ï¿½ CROWN COPYRIGHT 2016





     Background


  2. The appellant's claim can be  summarised  as  follows.  The  appellant
     fears for his life, if removed to Afghanistan, at  the  hands  of  the
     Taliban. The appellant's elder brothers served in the Afghan  National
     Army (ANA), in Kabul and another brother had  been  a  police  officer
     previously. The appellant's problems began in 2002  when  the  Taliban
     visited the family home  in  order  to  demand  that  the  appellant's
     brothers, W and Z, leave the ANA  and  the  police  service.  On  that
     occasion the appellant was attacked with an axe  and  his  father  was
     assaulted. There were other such visits. An uncle  of  the  appellant,
     who was a Taliban commando, killed  the  appellant's  brother,  Z,  in
     2008.  The  other  brother,  W,  did  not  return   home   thereafter.
     Arrangements were made for the appellant to leave Afghanistan in 2008,
     aged 15, because his mother feared that he would be forced to join the
     Taliban when older.  The Taliban killed the appellant's father in 2014
     because he had failed to prevent the appellant's brothers from serving
     in the ANA.

  3. In refusing the appellant's asylum claim, the respondent accepted  his
     identity and that he was a national of  Afghanistan.  The  appellant's
     claim to fear the Taliban was rejected as lacking credibility owing to
     what were said to be a number of inconsistencies between his accounts.
     Adverse comment was also made  regarding  the  appellant's  three-year
     delay in  applying  for  asylum  after  entering  the  United  Kingdom
     clandestinely in 2009.

  4. During the course of the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal,  the
     judge heard evidence from the appellant alone. The  judge  found  that
     the appellant was not a credible witness and  rejected  his  claim  to
     suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.


      Error of law


    5. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought  on  the  basis
       that, firstly, it was arguable that the judge erred in his  treatment
       of the medical evidence before him in  that  he  did  not  take  into
       account the appellant's injuries which a doctor  had  concluded  were
       consistent with his history of being struck on the head with an  axe.
       It was also said that the judge should have assessed the  appellant's
       evidence with some latitude in view  of  his  mental  health  issues.
       Secondly, in relation to the appellant's attempts  at  self-harm,  it
       was argued that the judge failed to take into account the appellant's
       physical and moral integrity in assessing his Article  8  claim  both
       within and outside the  Rules.  Reference  was  made  to  the  wholly
       inadequate mental health provision in Afghanistan.

    6. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that  it  was  arguable
       that the judge "failed to engage with the detail of  the  psychiatric
       report (which also addressed scars and the claimed blow to the  head)
       and failed to consider the medical evidence in the round, when making
       findings  about  the  credibility  of  the  appellant's  account   in
       Afghanistan."






    7. The Secretary of State's response of 3 May 2016  indicated  that  the
       application  was  opposed  and  that  the  judge   directed   himself
       appropriately. It was said  that  the  judge  analysed  the  evidence
       comprehensively and provided cogent reasons for concluding  that  the
       appellant's account of events in Afghanistan was not credible. It was
       open to the judge to consider the medical evidence to be  of  limited
       utility where PTSD had not been diagnosed. In view of the  fact  that
       there is some mental health provision in Afghanistan  and  Article  3
       was not pursued, the respondent was of the view that it was  open  to
       the judge  to  conclude  that  the  appellant's  moral  and  physical
       integrity was not engaged.


 The hearing


  8. Ms King made a formal application  to  amend  the  grounds,  with  the
     addition of what she  described  as  a  Robinson  obvious  point.  She
     submitted that the medical evidence had been discounted by  the  judge
     owing to two discrepancies. She raised no issue  in  relation  to  the
     first discrepancy, which concerned  the  date  the  appellant's  elder
     brother died. However, the other  apparent  discrepancy  was  said  to
     relate to the year of death of the appellant's father, regarding which
     the judge considered the appellant had given varying accounts. Ms King
     explained that the judge made a material mistake of fact  in  that  he
     had erroneously believed that the appellant  was  interviewed  by  the
     respondent in 2012 when this interview did not take place until  2015.
     Mr Walker had no objection  to  this  further  ground  and  I  granted
     permission to amend the grounds to include this matter.

  9. Ms King then relied on the two original  grounds  of  appeal,  arguing
     that once one of the two discrepancies fell away, the medical  reports
     should have been given more weight. She emphasised the  references  in
     the medical  report  to  the  appellant's  demeanour  as  well  as  to
     incidents of self-harm. With regard to the other  ground,  she  argued
     that the Article 8 conclusions could not stand. The  appellant's  case
     was that he could not return to his family home and  that  his  father
     was deceased. These matters added weight  to  the  issue  of  internal
     relocation, in that the appellant's case is that he could not live  in
     Kabul independently.

 10.  Mr  Walker  conceded  that  the  judge  erred  in  relation  to   his
     understanding of the date when the appellant's father was  killed  but
     asked me to note that this was not the only reason why  judge  reached
     an adverse view of credibility  and  accordingly  the  error  was  not
     material.  Otherwise, he considered that the judge's findings  on  the
     medical evidence were open to him.

 11. In reply, Ms King, argued that there was only one reason for rejecting
     the credibility of the appellant's account and it could  not  be  said
     that het same conclusion had been reached if this error had  not  been
     made.

     Decision on error of law

 12. The judge made material errors of law. His decision is set  aside,  in
     its entirety, for the following reasons.

 13. The judge noted at [29] of the decision and reasons,  in  relation  to
     the death of the appellant's father  that  "in  the  asylum  interview
     record in 2012 (the appellant) said  it  had  taken  place  2-3  weeks
     previously. Yet, when he told the psychiatrist in 2014, it  had  taken
     place that year." As accepted by Mr  Walker,  the  appellant  was  not
     interviewed in 2012 and therefore he had never said  that  his  father
     died in 2012. Furthermore, paragraph 9  of  the  reasons  for  refusal
     letter records the appellant as having told the  respondent  that  his
     father died in 2014.

 14. At [30] of the  decision,  the  judge  explains  why  the  appellant's
     apparent inability to be consistent has caused his credibility  to  be
     called into question; "Deaths of family members are clearly  traumatic
     events, but ones which would be embedded in somebody's mind. To be  so
     inconsistent in relation to those details seems to me  to  go  to  the
     core aspect of this account." I find that it could not  be  said  that
     had  the  judge  recognised  that  there  been  only   one   area   of
     inconsistency regarding the deaths of family members rather than  two,
     that he would have reached the same decision.

 15. There is also merit in the original grounds of  appeal  which  rightly
     identify that the judge failed to engage with the  medical  report  in
     any meaningful way. At [33], the  judge  is  dismissive  of  the  said
     report on the basis that it did  "no  more  than  identify  depressive
     conditions based on an appellant's self-reporting."

 16. The judge's understanding of the content of  the  medical  report  was
     incomplete. Apart from recording the appellant's account,  the  doctor
     observed his demeanour when recounting his  history,  particularly  in
     relation to the account  given  of  his  father's  death,  stating  as
     follows; "He appeared calm  and  at  ease  but,  when  describing  his
     father's death, he became red faced and tearful.  He could  not  speak
     for a minute or so and (then) spoke in a choked voice."  It  could  be
     said that the judge disregarded that finding, not that he said  so  in
     terms, because he had already decided that the appellant was not being
     truthful  about  his  father's  death.   As   indicated   above,   the
     aforementioned finding cannot stand.

 17. In addition to the doctor's observations when assessing the appellant,
     reference was made to his attempts to hang himself in a police cell in
     2013 and scarring consistent with the appellant's claimed attempts  to
     self-harm by cutting. The  doctor  also  found  that  a  scar  on  the
     appellant's head was consistent with being struck there by an axe  and
     comments on the possibility of resulting brain damage.  The  appellant
     was considered to be suffering from chronic PTSD and  depression.  The
     judge's reasons for rejecting all of these findings, if indeed he did,
     were inadequate.

 18. The judge's Article 8  assessment  was  inadequate,  in  view  of  the
     medical evidence of mental disorder, characterised by several attempts
     at self-harm. Documentary evidence in relation to the treatment of the
     mentally ill in Afghanistan was before the judge and he described  the
     report as painting a "bleak picture" of the  facilities.  Nonetheless,
     the judge found that the appellant did not have post-traumatic  stress
     disorder and therefore Article 8 was not engaged.

 19. No reasons are given for  the  judge's  rejection  of  expert  medical
     opinion as to the diagnosis. The judge  further  materially  erred  in
     concluding that his assessment of the appellant's Article 8 claim  was
     complete by the consideration of only the first limb of Razgar.

 20. In these circumstances I am satisfied that there  are  errors  of  law
     such that the decision be  set  aside,  to  be  remade.  None  of  the
     findings of the FTTJ are to stand.

 21. I considered listing this matter to be heard in the Upper Tribunal, in
     view of practice  statement  7  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
     Statements of 10 February 2010 (as amended), however the appellant has
     yet to have an adequate consideration of  his  asylum  appeal  at  the
     First-tier Tribunal and it would be unfair  to  deprive  his  of  such
     consideration.

 22. Further directions are set out below.

 23. An anonymity direction was made by the FTTJ. I consider it appropriate
     for anonymity  to  be  continued  and  therefore  make  the  following
     anonymity direction:

        "Pursuant to Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order.  Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings
    or any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall  directly  or  indirectly
    identify the original appellant. This  direction  applies  to,  amongst
    others, all parties. Any failure to comply with  this  direction  could
    give rise to contempt of court proceedings. "


Conclusions


     The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve  the
     making of an error on a point of law.

     I set aside the decision to be re-made.
