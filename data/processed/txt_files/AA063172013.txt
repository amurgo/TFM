Representation:

For the appellant: Mr G Saunders a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the respondent: Ms Y Gwashawamhu a solicitor from Bake &Co

                      NOTICE OF ABANDONMENT AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department.  I
      will refer to her as the Secretary  of  State.  The  respondent  is  a
      citizen of Zimbabwe born on 14 July 1961. I will refer to her  as  the
      claimant. The Secretary of State has been given permission  to  appeal
      the  determination  of  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge  Jacobs-Jones  who
      allowed  the  claimant's  appeal  against  the  Secretary  of  State's
      decision of 17 June 2013 to give directions for her removal  from  the
      UK following the refusal to vary her leave to enter the UK.



   2. At the hearing before me Mr Saunders informed  me  that  by  a  letter
      dated 20 October 2013 the Secretary of State had granted the  claimant
      leave to remain in the UK as a refugee.


   3. Mr Saunders requested that the Secretary  of  State's  appeal  to  the
      Upper Tribunal be withdrawn. I consent to  the  withdrawal  under  the
      provisions of paragraph 17 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)
      Rules 2008

   4. In these circumstances the appeal brought  by  the  claimant  must  be
      treated as abandoned under the provisions of section  104(4A)  of  the
      Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. Under the provisions  of
      paragraph 17A of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  I
      treat the claimant's appeal as abandoned. Notice of abandonment should
      be given to all parties in accordance with the Rules.
