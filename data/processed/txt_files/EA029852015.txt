                                NISHAN SINGH
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                             NOTICE OF DECISION

      1. In a decision  promulgated  on  24.2.17  Judge  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal Hollingworth concluded that  he  had  no  jurisdiction  to
         entertain the appellant's appeal against the respondent's  decision
         dated 15.3.16 to refuse his application for an EEA  residence  card
         pursuant to the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
         2006. Judge Hollingworth's decision relied on  the  Upper  Tribunal
         decision of Sala [2016] UKUT 0411. This was overturned by the Court
         of Appeal in Khan v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
         [2017] EWCA Civ 1755.

      2. In the notice of decision dated 18.12.17 I indicated that the Upper
         Tribunal was minded to find an error of law, set aside the decision
         of the First-tier Tribunal and remit the  case  to  the  First-tier
         Tribunal. If either of the parties was opposed to this course  they
         were directed to inform the Tribunal in writing  (giving  reasons),
         not later than 7 days from the date  the  Directions  were  issued.
         Following that period, the parties were  informed  that  the  Upper
         Tribunal would issue its decision.

      3. The Upper Tribunal has not received any correspondence from  either
         party within the stipulated timeframe.  In  the  light  of  Khan  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017]  EWCA  Civ  1755,
         the First-tier Tribunal was wrong in law to conclude  that  it  did
         not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

      4. The Upper Tribunal is consequently satisfied  that  the  First-tier
         Tribunal's decision is  marred  by  a  material  legal  error  (the
         unlawful view that it lacked jurisdiction).

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal decision is vitiated by a  material  error  of  law.
The case is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh  (de  novo)
hearing, before  a  judge  other  than  judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
Hollingworth.
