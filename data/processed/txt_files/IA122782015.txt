For the Appellant:     No appearance.
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the appellant against a  decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal (Judge J W H Law) refusing his appeal against a  decision
    made by the respondent on 13 March 2015 refusing his application for  a
    residence card as an extended family member. There was no appearance by
    or on behalf of the appellant at the hearing before me. I am  satisfied
    that the notice of hearing  was  properly  served  at  the  appellant's
    address for service. No explanation has been received for  his  failure
    to attend. In these circumstances I am satisfied that the proper course
    is to proceed with this hearing.

Background

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born in  1984.  On  30  November
    2014 he applied for a residence card as the nephew of  his  sponsor,  a
    German citizen living in the UK. His application  was  refused  as  the
    respondent was not satisfied that the appellant had been  dependent  on
    his sponsor both in Pakistan and in  the  UK.  The  appellant  appealed
    against this decision asking for  his  appeal  to  be  decided  on  the
    documentary evidence without an oral hearing.

The Findings of the First-tier Tribunal Judge

3.   The judge considered the documents  in  the  appellant's  bundle  which
    included statements by the appellant and the sponsor. The appellant had
    said that while he was studying in Pakistan his sponsor was  supporting
    him by sending money and  there  were  money  transfer  vouchers  dated
    between March 2009 and April 2011 showing that money was being sent  to
    the appellant at the  rate  of  �150  per  month.  However,  the  judge
    commented that the appellant had not explained the  source  of  a  bank
    transfer for Rs350,000  in  February  2011.  He  also  noted  that  the
    appellant said in his statement that the sponsor "is responsible for my
    maintenance and accommodation, I am dependent on him for my daily  life
    and living. I am currently  living  with  him  under  the  same  roof."
    However, the sponsor in his statement only referred to money  which  he
    had sent to Pakistan when the appellant was studying there.

4.   The  judge  was  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  could  meet  the
    requirements of reg 8(2) of the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 for the reasons set out at [10]-[13]. In the light  of
    the lack of explanation for the transfer of Rs350,000 the  judge  could
    not be satisfied that the appellant had been dependent on  the  sponsor
    while in Pakistan. The appellant had also not been living in  the  same
    household as the sponsor while he was living in Pakistan.  He  accepted
    that the appellant was now living in the same household in the  UK  but
    there was no evidence that he had been doing so between April 2011  and
    January 2013.

5.   The evidence of financial dependency in the UK was recent. Payments  of
    �50 a month only began in August  2014  and  there  were  regular  bank
    transfers of �420 which the appellant was receiving in 2012  which  had
    not been explained which suggested that he was at that stage  receiving
    financial support from another person. The judge also took into account
    the point made by the respondent  that  the  sponsor  did  not  have  a
    national insurance number prior to  2014  and  the  appellant  had  not
    commented on this matter.

The Grounds of Appeal and Submissions

6.   In his grounds the appellant argues that the  judge  did  not  consider
    the evidence of the money transfers and misdirected himself  about  how
    the sponsor could pay a certain amount of  money  in  a  month.  It  is
    further argued that the judge did not refer to the  dependency  of  the
    appellant on the sponsor in Pakistan and that he failed  to  take  into
    account relevant case law and in particular Jia C-1/05  [2007]  Imm  AR
    439 where the CJEU found that there was no requirement for  a  national
    court to consider the reasons for the dependency on a union citizen.

7.   Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that there  were  aspects
    of favourable findings in the judge's decision, which raised  questions
    as to whether there had been a proper application of  the  evidence  to
    the requirements of the law as set out in the grounds of appeal.

8.   Mr Jarvis relied on the rule 24 response which submits that  the  judge
    had considered all the relevant evidence and had given adequate reasons
    for his findings of fact. The finding that the appellant was not living
    in the same household as the sponsor between  April  2011  and  January
    2013 was properly open to the judge.

Assessment of Whether there is an Error of Law

9.   I am not satisfied  that  the  judge  erred  in  law  in  reaching  his
    findings and conclusions. The  issue  of  dependency  and  whether  the
    appellant and his sponsor were living in the same household were issues
    of fact for the judge  to  resolve  on  the  evidence  before  him.  He
    explained why  he  was  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  had  been
    dependent on his sponsor in Germany. There is nothing to indicate  that
    the judge did not approach the matter in accordance with Jia.

10.  The grounds argue that in the light  of  the  numerous  money  transfer
    vouchers produced at the hearing the appellant was  able  to  meet  the
    requirements of the regulations. However, in substance, the grounds are
    an attempt to re-argue issues of fact where the judge reached  findings
    properly open to him. Similarly, the issue  of  whether  and  when  the
    appellant and the sponsor had been living in the same household was  an
    issue of fact that the judge resolved on the evidence before  him.  His
    findings and conclusions were properly open to him for the  reasons  he
    gave.


Decision

11.  The First-tier Tribunal did not err in law  and  it  follows  that  its
    decision stands.
