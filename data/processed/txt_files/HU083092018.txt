Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P Saini, Counsel instructed by Clyde Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms L Kenny, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a Pakistani national whose date of birth  is  recorded
    as 28th June 1982.  He first arrived in  the  United  Kingdom  on  16th
    November 2006 as a student.  He then applied in time for extensions  of
    leave until on 23rd June 2016 he applied for indefinite leave to remain
    as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant.  On 26th October 2016  that  application
    was varied to an application for indefinite  leave  to  remain  on  the
    grounds of ten years' continuous lawful residence.  The application was
    refused.

 2.  The  Secretary  of  State  relied  principally  on  paragraph   322(5)
    contending that the Appellant's conduct was such that he ought  not  to
    be granted the relief he sought.  There were question marks so  far  as
    the Secretary of State was  concerned  over  the  tax  returns  of  the
    Appellant in years 2010/2011 and in the following  year.   The  history
    with respect to that is set out at paragraph 7 of the decision of Judge
    Monaghan and I do not propose to set it out again.

 3. The Appellant appealed.  His appeal was heard on 24th October  2018  by
    Judge Monaghan sitting at Bradford.  She came  to  the  view  that  the
    Appellant ought not to succeed and she dismissed the appeal.

 4. Not content with that decision by Notice dated 28th November  2018  the
    Appellant sought permission to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.   The
    grounds are lengthy running to 51 paragraphs.  Judge of the  First-tier
    Tribunal Nightingale however was able to wade her way through them  and
    on 6th December 2018  granted  permission.   There  were  a  number  of
    grounds, but it is of note that Judge Nightingale  principally  granted
    permission because of concern over  whether  the  judge  had  correctly
    applied the burden of proof such being on the Secretary of  State  when
    dishonesty is in issue.

 5. I propose to deal very briefly  with  the  other  grounds.   The  first
    submits that the judge erred in allowing the appeal when the  Secretary
    of State had not followed his own policy in  coming  to  the  decision.
    That is because a decision of this kind  needed  to  be  put  before  a
    senior caseworker and was not.   The  decision  therefore  was  not  in
    accordance with the law.  That is a term of art however and that Ground
    of Appeal as a statutory ground was not  available  to  this  Appellant
    under the current regime.  The five-stage test in Razgar  has,  as  the
    second question after considering whether the  proposed  removal  would
    engage Article 8, consideration of whether any interference would  have
    consequences of such gravity as potentially to engage the operation  of
    it, and the third test is if so, is  such  interference  in  accordance
    with the law?  It is clear that that interference being  in  accordance
    with the law relates to the interference, not the  decision,  and  that
    was a point made clear by the Court of Appeal in the case  of  Singh  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA  Civ  362.   The
    second ground relates to the burden of proof  and  I  shall  return  to
    that.

 6. Ground 3 submits that the judge had failed to appreciate that there was
    a discretionary nature to the basis upon which the application had been
    refused, in other words, paragraph 322(5) is not a mandatory Ground  of
    Refusal.  There is some substance in  the  submission  that  the  judge
    having approached the case as she did, did not recognise that there was
    a discretionary basis here but it is of note at paragraph 44  that  the
    judge says in terms that paragraph  322(5)  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    states that the Respondent may  refuse  an  application  for  leave  to
    remain on discretionary grounds.  The point however that Mr Saini makes
    is that having self-directed in that way it appears to  have  been  the
    single determining factor.  Again, I shall return to  that  because  it
    goes to the way in which this case should properly be resolved.

 7. At Ground 4 Mr Saini submits that the lack of penalty by HMRC  deserved
    consideration by the judge of the level of misconduct on  the  part  of
    the Appellant.  The fact that there was no penalty awarded should  have
    weighed heavily it is  suggested  in  any  proportionality  assessment.
    Taken in the round there may be some merit in that point but  there  is
    no sufficient evidence before me to suggest  that  the  Inland  Revenue
    would understand the significance of a person overstating their  income
    in the context of immigration in order to obtain the  relief  that  was
    being sought.  Indeed, I take the view that Grounds 4, 5  and  6  taken
    together are of the sort that were in the mind of  McCombe  LJ  in  the
    case of VW (Sri Lanka) [2013] EWCA Civ 522 when he  said  at  paragraph
    12:

         "Regrettably, there is an increasing tendency in immigration cases,
         when a First-tier Tribunal Judge has given  a  judgment  explaining
         why he has reached a particular decision, of seeking to burrow  out
         industriously areas of evidence that have  been  less  fully  dealt
         with than others and then to use this as a  basis  for  saying  the
         judge's decision is legally flawed because it did not deal  with  a
         particular matter more fully".

 8. I return then to the main point which is the  burden  and  standard  of
    proof.  In the case of Shen (Paper appeals, proving dishonesty)  [2014]
    UKUT 236 it was said that:

         "(1)     In terms of the approach  that  a  Tribunal  should  adopt
             towards  decisions  of  the  Secretary  of  State   in   which
             dishonesty or deception is alleged against  an  applicant  for
             leave to remain, the starting point should be, as the Court of
             Appeal in Adedoyin [2010] EWCA Civ 773 have made  clear,  that
             pursuant to  paragraph  322  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  the
             reference to 'false' means 'dishonestly' false.

         (2)  Where an application form etc. is false  in  a  material  way,
             this may be relied on by the Secretary of State as prima facie
             evidence establishing dishonesty. The inference of  deliberate
             deception can be  strengthened  by  other  facts:  e.g.  if  a
             criminal conviction (not disclosed in an application) occurred
             shortly before completion of the application form.  Here,  the
             conviction must have been high in the applicant's mind and any
             explanation based on oversight would carry little weight.  But
             it is always open to  an  Appellant  to  proffer  an  innocent
             explanation and if that explanation meets  a  basic  level  of
             plausibility, the burden switches back  to  the  Secretary  of
             State to answer that evidence.  At the  end  of  the  day  the
             Secretary of State bears the burden of proving dishonesty".

    That is where the difficulty for the Secretary of State in my  judgment
    lies in this case.  The legal burden was upon the  Secretary  of  State
    and stayed upon the Secretary of State throughout.   The  Secretary  of
    State did raise a prima facie case.  There were serious question  marks
    over the accounts which had been submitted by the Appellant  which  had
    overstated the income which would provide him with  a  benefit.   There
    was also a clear error of exactly ï¿½1,000 in respect of one  item  which
    called for explanation.  The Appellant provided one.   His  explanation
    was that he went to accountants, indeed it would appear that he went to
    a number of accountants although it is not entirely  clear  given  that
    the  Secretary  of  State  bears  the  burden  as  to  quite  how  many
    accountants he went to, but  having  raised  an  innocent  explanation,
    namely that he went to accountants and relied upon them,  and  that  he
    did not fully understand what was being provided to him  on  the  basis
    that he had asked professional people to prepare them so that he simply
    signed  on  the  dotted  line   which   he   did   relying   on   their
    professionalism, it was for the Secretary of State to disprove it.

 9. At paragraph 65 of her judgment Judge  Monaghan  says,  "Therefore  the
    Respondent  has  established  that  he  was  entitled  to  refuse   the
    application under paragraph 322(5)".

         That may be the case; it may be that the decision was justified  by
         the Secretary of State but that does not answer  the  appeal.   The
         Respondent Secretary of State would have been entitled to  maintain
         that position absent any innocent explanation.

10. At paragraph 59 having considered the evidence the judge says:

         "I therefore find, in the light of my concerns  as  to  credibility
         that the Appellant has not persuaded me that there was an  innocent
         explanation for the  difference  for  the  income  claimed  in  his
         previous application for leave to remain and the income declared to
         HMRC".

11. In a case which turns on dishonesty I would suggest that  it  would  be
    better for a judge to pin her colours to the mast  rather  than  simply
    raise concerns but more particularly, the decision as a whole reads  as
    if the judge required the Appellant to prove the innocent  explanation.
    It was not for the Appellant to do that, it was for  the  Secretary  of
    State to disprove it.  A number of accountants had been mentioned.   It
    is not suggested by the Secretary of State that he was not aware of the
    Appellant's case in  advance  of  the  hearing;  it  was  open  to  the
    Secretary of  State  to  call  those  accountants  and  obtain  witness
    statements from them if so advised.

12. Ms Kenny realistically, faced with the  way  in  which  the  judge  has
    expressed herself, accepts that it did not appear that the Secretary of
    State had brought any sufficient  evidence  before  the  Tribunal.   Of
    course, the Secretary of State can in certain circumstances rely on the
    evidence of the Appellant and say that the evidence is  so  lacking  in
    credibility that the Respondent relies on that as proof but that is not
    how this case was presented, nor how it reads.

13. In my judgment there was a material error of law which means  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal is to be set aside.  I then have to
    decide whether to remit the case or to re-make it.  The only basis upon
    which the judge appears to have dismissed  the  application  was  based
    upon her concerns as to the credibility of the Appellant in relation to
    the tax affairs.  The burden being on the Secretary of  State  and  not
    having been proved it seems that the only proper course now is  to  re-
    make the case on the basis that absent that  point  being  proved,  the
    Appellant is entitled to succeed.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make no  fee  award
given that there was a prima facie case which called for an explanation.
