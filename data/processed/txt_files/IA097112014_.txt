                    DEPUTY UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE APPLEYARD

                                   Between

                             Miss Aasma Shaheen
                                                                   Appellant

                                     and

               THE Secretary of State FOR THE Home Department
                                                                  Respondent



                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who applied for leave to  remain
    in the United Kingdom as a Tier 2 Migrant under the points-based system
    and against whom the respondent made directions pursuant to Section  47
    of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 to remove her.

 2.  She  appealed  the  respondent's  decision  and  in  a   determination
    promulgated on 6 June 2014 Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Lester
    dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal.   In  so  doing  she  recorded  at
    paragraph 16 that the Section 47 direction was invalid by reason of the
    authority of Ahmadi v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 512 and then  dismissed  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 3. The appellant  sought  permission  to  appeal.   However,  it  was  not
    granted.  The judge did though, of his own volition,  grant  permission
    on what he deemed to be a "Robinson obvious" point.  He found that  the
    Section 47 decision was not invalid as the judge  had  failed  to  take
    account of Section 51 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013.

 4. The appellant's representatives wrote to the Tribunal in a letter dated
    11 August 2014 asking for her appeal to be withdrawn.

 5. Whilst the judge did err in her consideration of Section 47 I would not
    have found that this was a material error. However,  in  light  of  the
    correspondence from those representing  the  appellant  I  treat  these
    proceedings  as  now  being  concluded  by  reason  of  the   appellant
    withdrawing her appeal.






Signed                                  Date 19 August 2014.


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Appleyard
