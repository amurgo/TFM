Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. This is the appeal of RMA, a citizen of Sri Lanka born 10 November 1993,
   against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Birk)  of  23
   August 2018 dismissing his appeal, itself brought against the refusal of
   his asylum claim on 22 February 2018.


2. His asylum claim is summarised  in  the  refusal  letter  thus.  He  was
   arrested in 2006 and detained for 1 or 2 days,  beaten  and  accused  of
   assisting  the  LTTE.  He  was  forcibly  recruited  by  LTTE  and   was
   responsible for collecting food and delivering it to front line  troops,
   during which  time  he  was  injured  by  shrapnel.  He  was  mistreated
   (including suffering sexual torture) in detention at  St  Joseph's  camp
   from 16 May 2009 to 14 January 2013; he was released after  his  parents
   paid a bribe.  He was arrested and detained for 2 days by the CID on  15
   March 2014. He suffered  from  PTSD  and  depression  due  to  this  ill
   treatment. He feared torture or death at the hands of  the  army  if  he
   returned to Sri Lanka.

3. The Appellant entered the UK on 21 June 2016,  using  a  false  passport
   supplied by  an  agent,  and  claimed  asylum  on  11  March  2017.  His
   immigration history also recorded that he had applied unsuccessfully for
   a Tier 4 student visa, the application being  refused  on  12  September
   2013.

4. The Respondent refused his asylum claim, on the basis that  his  account
   of past events was not credible and that in any event he  was  merely  a
   low level activist.

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

5. In oral evidence he elaborated on his case, stating that  from  2014  to
   2016 he had avoided searches of the family home by the security  forces,
   initially by staying elsewhere, but at some point by  hiding  under  the
   bed. In the UK he had become involved with the TGTE on 27 November 2017;
   mixing with other TGTE members made him happy and  relieved  his  mental
   stress. His UK-based brothers were not so involved. He only participated
   in demonstrations, and held no  position  beyond  being  a  member.  His
   father had been arrested and questioned about him in 2018;  he  did  not
   know when he had been released though he had  last  spoken  to  him  two
   weeks earlier.

The First-tier Tribunal Decision

6. The First-tier Tribunal noted the most recent  medical  report  from  Dr
   Dhumad, of July 2018, stating the Appellant was suffering from PTSD  and
   severe depression for which he received medication and counselling,  and
   that he had the capacity to attend the hearing and give evidence, albeit
   that he required breaks to assist him. Accordingly it was appropriate to
   proceed with regard to the Vulnerable Witness Practice Direction.

7. The First-tier Tribunal accepted much of the Appellant's account of past
   events including his forced involvement with the LTTE and the subsequent
   arrests, detention and ill treatment in Sri Lanka. The Dr Dhumad  report
   suffered from the  disadvantage  of  having  postulated  no  alternative
   causation for the Appellant's  presentation  to  that  afforded  by  the
   Appellant's account. Dr Lawrence's report  of  November  2016  was  more
   impressive, for its diagnosis of PTSD and  severe  secondary  depression
   was made in the context of having considered that it was highly unlikely
   that the Appellant could have simulated his symptoms  to  the  point  of
   faking an entire syndrome. The Judge concluded that there was a good and
   strong likelihood that the Appellant had  suffered  severe  trauma  that
   went beyond simply having grown up in a war-torn area but  also  due  to
   events that had befallen him personally.  Furthermore  his  account  was
   generally consistent when read in the context of the background  country
   information, bearing in mind the photographs of him in combat  gear  and
   his cogent responses to the refusal letter.

8. However, the Tribunal did not accept the  more  modern  aspects  of  the
   Appellant's asserted history. It was not credible that he was pursued in
   Sri Lanka for some two years after  his  release  without  being  found,
   particularly given his assertion that he was able to evade  searches  by
   hiding under the bed. Furthermore

   a) Photographs allegedly showing his family being harassed by the police
      in 2018 were unreliable, given that they were not referenced in the
      statements of the Appellant of August 2018 statement or that of his
      father;

   b) The Appellant's father had written a letter referring to the CID
      continuously visiting the family home seeking information about the
      Appellant, but it was difficult to tally the assertions made with the
      chronology otherwise provided in the case.

9. The Appellant had not had any significant role in diaspora activities in
   the UK, merely attending demonstrations in November  2017  and  February
   2018; there was no evidence of activities with the TGTE extending beyond
   membership, and this was not enough to give him a sufficient profile  to
   place him at  risk,  applying  the  Country  Guidelines.  There  was  no
   reliable evidence of adverse interest in him since  his  departure  from
   Sri Lanka to raise a possibility of him being on  a  "stop"  or  "watch"
   list. Accordingly his international protection claim failed.


10. As to his mental health,  whilst  he  required  ongoing  medication  and
   psychiatric treatment, he lacked any clear plan to  commit  suicide  and
   was not mentally unstable or fragile that he was unable to  communicate.
   This did not reach the high threshold  established  by  the  authorities
   including N v United Kingdom (26565/05  [2008]  ECHR  453)  even  having
   regard  to  the  difficulty  of  locating  and  accessing  psychological
   facilities in Sri Lanka referenced in GJ ï¿½454-456.

11. Grounds of appeal contended that the First-tier Tribunal had  materially
   erred in law:

   a) In failing to take account of material evidence, including a
      statement from Attorney-at-Law Anton Punethanayagam who had recounted
      the Appellant's mother's attendance at his office seeking assistance
      in relation to the authorities' asserted continued harassment of the
      family, and had explained that his colleague's enquiries had
      confirmed that there was interest in the Appellant from the security
      forces; and a letter from the MP to whom complaint was said to have
      been made;


   b) In misunderstanding the Appellant's evidence, which was not that he
      had repeatedly avoided detection at home by hiding under the bed, but
      merely that he had generally stayed with a friend of his father
      following his release from detention, but that, at one time when he
      was at the family home, he avoided detection during a search: that
      search was not directed particularly at him, but followed the
      discovery of an arms cache at the house of a friend who had himself
      been detained;


   c) In failing to appreciate that the country evidence, as summarised by
      the Court of Appeal in ME (Sri Lanka), showed that a post-conflict
      arrest necessitated the conclusion that its subject fell into the
      first of the risk categories identified in GJ;


   d) In failing to apply the appropriate test for a suicide risk case,
      which was whether A could access the necessary treatment for his
      mental health problems such as to avoid the risk of completed
      suicide, bearing in mind that he would be returning to the country
      where the mistreatment underlying his mental health problems
      occurred.

12. Although the First-tier  Tribunal  refused  permission  to  appeal,  the
   Upper  Tribunal  granted  permission  on  11   December   2018.   Whilst
   recognising the force of the grounds of appeal relating to international
   protection, it stated that the Article 3  mental  health  ground  lacked
   substance given the findings that the Appellant lacked any clear plan to
   commit suicide, given the family support he had in Sri Lanka.


13. Mr Walker for the Respondent accepted that the decision  was  inadequate
   for failing to take account of critical evidence.  Ms Bayati  emphasised
   that my disposal of appeal should  consider  preserving  those  positive
   findings made in the Appellant's favour given that the  asserted  errors
   in the grounds of appeal had not undermined the thinking behind them.

Findings and reasons

14. This is an  appeal  where  the  Appellant's  asylum  claim  had  several
   strands to it. He potentially faced risks of harm because of:


   a) Firstly, his history of arrest and detention;


   b) Secondly, the asserted ongoing interest by  the  authorities  in  the
      period leading up to his departure from Sri Lanka;

   c) Thirdly, his activities in the UK.

15. The First-tier Tribunal accepted the facts relating  to  the  first  and
   third aspects, but rejected the veracity of  the  second.  It  concluded
   that those aspects of his claim that were accepted presented no real  of
   persecution.


16. The headnote of GJ (post-civil war: returnees) Sri Lanka CG [2013]  UKUT
   319 (IAC) sets out that the Sri Lankan government's present objective is
   to identify Tamil activists in the diaspora who are  working  for  Tamil
   separatism  and  to  destabilise  the  unitary  Sri  Lankan  state.  The
   categories of persons at real risk  relevant  here  (leaving  aside  the
   cases of journalists and those associated with the Lessons  Learned  and
   Reconciliation Commission) were:


           "(a) Individuals who are, or are perceived to be, a threat to
           the integrity of Sri Lanka as a single state because they are,
           or are perceived to have a significant role in relation to post-
           conflict Tamil separatism.
           ...
           (d) A person whose name appears on a computerised "stop" list
           accessible at the airport, comprising a list of those against
           whom there is an extant court order or arrest warrant.
           Individuals whose name appears on a "stop" list will be stopped
           at the airport and handed over to the appropriate Sri Lankan
           authorities, in pursuance of such order or warrant."


17. Given the stance of the parties, I can  be  brief  in  my  reasons.  The
   First Ground of appeal is particularly significant.


18. There was material evidence before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  was
   ostensibly independent of the Appellant  himself  and  thus  potentially
   corroborated his asylum claim. The lawyer recorded a visit to his office
   by the Appellant's mother, and that she had given an account  of  visits
   from the security forces that was generally consistent with the evidence
   summarised above. His letter continued:


      "I through my junior Attorney-at-law inquired about this and I was
      informed that [the Appellant] was arrested and end by the Sri Lankan
      authorities because now is in UK and involving in activities against
      the Sri Lankan Government there. Due to this reason they need more
      information about him and they are seeking for his arrest. Until they
      get history under their custody they will not stop their activities.
      This was informed to [the Appellant's mother] and I could not prevent
      activities of the government authorities at this stage."

19. The sense, if not the syntax, of that letter  is  clear  enough.  It  is
   patently evidence that might have caused the First-tier Tribunal to come
   to a different conclusion than that which  it  reached,  given  that  it
   apparently emanates from the member of the legal profession. However  it
   receives no mention in its decision. That represents a failure  to  take
   account of highly material evidence that could have had a bearing on the
   appeal's outcome.


20. It seems to me that that was such a significant  failing  as  to  demand
   the appeal's re-hearing. The relevance  of  the  other  asserted  errors
   somewhat falls away given my conclusion, though they  nevertheless  have
   some force.

   a)  The  MP's  letter  was  also  overlooked,  though  it  repeated  the
      Appellant's family's claims rather than representing any  independent
      investigation into them. It nevertheless has some  evidential  value,
      as one presumes that Members of Parliament do not  lightly  write  on
      their constituents' behalf.


   b) It does seem that the First-tier Tribunal misunderstood the  evidence
      before it as to the Appellant's ability to  avoid  detection  at  his
      family home: he was not there for a lengthy  period  and  the  single
      raid where he avoided detection arose from a general  search  of  the
      area rather than being an attempt to apprehend him as an individual.


21. Ms Bayati submitted that aspects of the First-tier  Tribunal's  findings
   should be preserved. Given that there is no challenge by  the  Secretary
   of State to the acceptance of the Appellant's past arrest and detention,
   and as the errors identified do not impact on that aspect of the Judge's
   reasoning, there is no reason for those findings to be revisited.

22. Two further points arise.

23. Firstly, in UB (Sri Lanka) [2017] EWCA Civ 85 the Court  of  Appeal  set
   out Home Office policy guidance dated 28 August  2014,  entitled  "Tamil
   Separatism". The judgment records:


      "12. Annexed to the guidance is the text of two letters from the
      British High Commission in Sri Lanka. This material is authoritative
      and clearly intended to be read with the guidance. The first letter is
      dated 16 April 2014:
      "Proscribed Terrorist Groups
      On 1 April 2014, the government of Sri Lanka announced the designation
      of 16 Tamil Diaspora organisations and 424 individuals under the UN
      Security Council resolution 1373 on counter-terrorism. The order was
      issued by the Secretary of Defence. The government asserts that this
      action has been taken to stop attempts to revive the LTTE. The BHC
      [i.e. British High Commission] has asked the government of Sri Lanka
      to provide evidence to support this decision.
      Among the organisations proscribed are the Transnational Government of
      Tamil Eelam (TGTE) and the UK-based Global Tamil Forum (GTF) and
      British Tamil Forum (BTF). When making the announcement on 1 April,
      Brigadier Ruwan Wanigasooriya said that individuals belonging to these
      organisations would face arrest under anti-terrorism laws ... [T]o
      date, there have been no known arrests based on membership of one of
      the newly proscribed groups."
      13. The later letter is dated 25 July 2014 and the relevant text
      reads:
           "The spokesperson from the DIE stated that returnees may be
           questioned on arrival by immigration, CID, SIS and TID. They may
           be questioned about what they have been doing whilst out of Sri
           Lanka, including whether they have been involved with one of the
           Tamil Diaspora groups. He said that it was normal practice for
           returnees to be asked about their activities in the country they
           were returning from.
      The spokesperson from the SIS said that people being "deported" will
      always be questioned about their overseas activities, including
      whether they have been involved with one of the proscribed
      organisations. He said that members of the organisations are not
      banned from returning to Sri Lanka, they are allowed to return, but
      will be questioned on arrival and may be detained.""


24. Given that material it  is  apparent  that  even  bare  membership-level
   involvement with the TGTE may create some risk of interest from the  Sri
   Lankan security forces. Whether or not the situation remains as  it  was
   when that Guidance was issued will  need  to  be  considered  on  a  re-
   hearing. Any risks arising from the Appellant's return to Sri Lanka must
   be assessed with this in mind. He cannot be expected to dissemble if  he
   is questioned by the authorities.


25. Secondly, there is the question of the Appellant's  mental  health.  The
   ground of appeal to the Upper Tribunal contesting the lawfulness of  the
   First-tier Tribunal's approach to this issue was not granted  permission
   to proceed. However, the matter does not necessarily  end  there,  given
   that the First-tier Tribunal is under a statutory duty to assess matters
   as at the date of any future hearing. So if there  is  further  evidence
   adduced relating to the Appellant's mental health, that may require that
   the issue be reopened.

26. Mental health claims arising from historic torture do  not  fall  to  be
   assessed only via Article 3 ECHR. Notably, the CJEU in MP [2018] EUECJ C-
   353/16 finds that where a torture victim still suffering the effects  of
   torture is returning to a country where the national authorities do  not
   meet their obligations to make appropriate reparation, and  where  their
   health problems would be  significantly  aggravated,  they  may  have  a
   viable claim for humanitarian  protection.   That  decision  may  become
   relevant depending on the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal.

27. So in conclusion, the First-tier Tribunal erred in law. The matter  must
   be re-heard.  There  is  no  reason  to  revisit  the  findings  on  the
   Appellant's past arrest and detention

          Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contains  material  errors  of
    law.
    The appeal is allowed to the  extent  it  is  remitted  for  re-hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

    Anonymity Order


    I make an anonymity order under Rule 14(1) of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  prohibiting  the  disclosure   of   any
    information or matter likely to lead members of the public to  be  able
    to identify the Appellant.
