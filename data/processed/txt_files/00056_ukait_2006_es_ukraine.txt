Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J. Goldberg Q.C. and Mr M. Mullins, counsel
                    instructed by Gillman-Smith Lee solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C. Trent, Home Office Presenting Officer

The  transitional   provisions   associated   with   the   introduction   of
administrative removal of overstayers (section 10 of the 1999 Act)  allow  a
deportation order to be made after commencement when the  decision  to  make
such an order was made before commencement. However,  those  provisions  are
intended to deal only with  process  that  was  pending  in  that  sense  at
commencement on 2nd October 2000. They should  not  be  read  as  preventing
section 10 from ever applying to a person  if  a  deportation  decision  has
been made against him before that date.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. This is the reconsideration of an appeal against  a  decision  of  the
      respondent made on 25th January 2005 to refuse to revoke a deportation
      order made  against  the  appellant.   The  appeal  was  heard  by  an
      immigration judge, Mr R. A.  Britton,  on  24th  November  2005.   The
      appeal was dismissed on human rights grounds  as  well  as  under  the
      immigration rules.  Reconsideration was ordered on 12th January 2006.


   2.  At the end of the hearing we told the parties that we had found there
      to be a material error of law by the immigration judge, that we  would
      substitute a fresh decision to allow the  appeal  and  that  we  would
      issue a written determination giving our reasons, as we  are  required
      to do.


Background and immigration history.

   3. The appellant, who was born on  25th  April  1981,  is  a  citizen  of
      Ukraine. Her immigration history, entwined as it is with that  of  her
      mother, is somewhat involved but  needs  to  be  set  out.  After  her
      parents' marriage ended in divorce in  October  1993  the  appellant's
      mother decided to leave Ukraine and to  bring  the  appellant  to  the
      United Kingdom. They arrived on 17th July 1994 and were granted  leave
      to enter for six months as visitors. By January  1995  the  appellant,
      now fourteen years old, was at school and an application was submitted
      for her to remain as a student. Her mother applied at  the  same  time
      for further leave as a visitor. Both applications were refused in June
      1995 and in August of that year the appellant and her mother  returned
      to Ukraine.


   4. Shortly  before  returning  to  Ukraine  the  appellant's  mother  had
      discussed the possibility of marriage with an elderly man for whom she
      had cooked and cleaned whilst in the United Kingdom. In May  1996  the
      appellant and her mother returned to the United Kingdom  and  (despite
      what we have just recorded) presented themselves as visitors and  were
      again granted leave to enter for six  months  in  that  capacity.  The
      appellant's mother married this man the following month and  submitted
      an application for leave to remain as the spouse of a  person  present
      and settled here, with her daughter as a dependant to that claim.  The
      application was refused and an appeal to an adjudicator was dismissed,
      the adjudicator accepting  the  evidence  of  the  gentleman  who  had
      entered into this marriage with the appellant's mother  and  who  told
      the adjudicator that that they did not live together as man  and  wife
      and the marriage was a sham. He said it had been entered into  at  the
      request of the appellant's mother with a view to avoiding the need for
      her to return to Ukraine so that her daughter could remain  to  pursue
      her education in the United Kingdom.  There is no  reason  at  all  to
      doubt that that was the truth.

   5. The appellant celebrated her eighteenth birthday on 25th  April  1999.
      On 6th August 1999 the appellant was served with notice of a  decision
      to make a deportation order  against  her,  as  was  her  mother.  The
      appellant was a person  liable  to  deportation  pursuant  to  section
      3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971 because, having been granted  only
      a limited leave to enter for six months, she remained beyond the  time
      limited by the leave.

   6. In October 1999 the appellant commenced a four year degree  course  at
      Exeter College Oxford, reading modern languages.  We  need  to  say  a
      little more about this. She was partly supported by a scholarship from
      Lincoln Cathedral, which was paid to her, we understand, for all  four
      years. The course itself, however, lasts only three years.  The  third
      year of four is a year  in  which  students  have  no  course  at  the
      university, but are free to pursue whatever activity they choose. Many
      go to a country where the language they are studying  is  spoken.  The
      appellant chose  instead  to  stay  in  the  United  Kingdom,  working
      illegally. We do not know the basis upon which   her  scholarship  was
      paid to her in that year. We also do  not  know  to  what  extent  the
      authorities at Exeter College were fully aware of her status. We  were
      told at the hearing that the appellant's tutor, her solicitor and  the
      sub-Dean of Lincoln were fully in the know. We make no  finding  about
      that as we have not heard from them.

   7.  The  appellant  did  not  appeal  against  the  decision  to  make  a
      deportation order. Her mother did appeal but that appeal, which  could
      be brought only in respect of the lawfulness of the decision  and  not
      on its merits, was dismissed on 7th March 2000.

   8. On 27th October 2000 the appellant submitted an  application  for  the
      grant of exceptional leave outside the  immigration  rules.  She  said
      that she made the application on two grounds.  First,  she  wished  to
      remain to complete her studies at Exeter  College.  Second,  she  said
      that as a result of having lived in the vicinity of Chernobyl she  was
      exposed to radiation and medical evidence suggested she might  have  a
      problem with her thyroid gland in  respect  of  which  she  wished  to
      remain for medical treatment.

   9. On 2nd February 2002 the appellant was served with notice  of  refusal
      of that application. On the same date the appellant  was  served  with
      the deportation order, which had been signed on 13th December 2001. It
      was in the usual terms, requiring her to leave the United Kingdom. The
      appellant appears to have taken no notice of it.

  10. A year later,  on  20th  February  2003,  the  appellant's  solicitors
      submitted a human rights claim on her behalf. Her mother had also made
      such a claim. The claims were treated as applications  for  revocation
      of the deportation orders which had, by now, been made against both of
      them. Her mother's appeal against refusal was dismissed on  4th  March
      2004. This, as we shall see, has a considerable  significance  because
      the Secretary of State had undertaken that, in order  to  protect  the
      family life which  the  Secretary  of  State  recognised  as  existing
      between the appellant and her  mother,  the  appellant  would  not  be
      removed until any appeal rights of her mother had been exhausted.  Her
      mother's application to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal for  leave  to
      appeal was unsuccessful and so her appeal rights came  to  an  end  on
      17th June 2004.

  11. As mentioned at the beginning of this  determination,  notice  of  the
      respondent's decision to refuse to revoke the deportation order served
      upon the appellant is dated 25th January 2005. Her appeal against that
      decision was dismissed by an immigration judge following a hearing  on
      24th  November  2005.  It  is  in  respect  of  that   decision   that
      reconsideration has been ordered.

The reasons given by the Respondent for refusing to revoke  the  deportation
order.

  12. The reasons given  by  the  respondent  for  refusing  to  revoke  the
      deportation order are those set out in the Home  Office  letter  dated
      25th  January  2005.  After  reviewing  the  immigration  history  the
      respondent summarised the grounds upon which the appellant had  sought
      revocation of the order. It was  claimed  it  would  be  a  breach  of
      article 8 for the appellant to be removed  while  her  mother  had  an
      outstanding human rights appeal. Also, the appellant was now a student
      at university. The costs of her studies were being met by  benefactors
      at considerable expense, more than ï¿½30,000.  As  the  appellant  would
      soon be taking her final examinations to interrupt those  studies  now
      would be unconscionable, cruel and inhuman.

  13. The appeal of the appellant's mother had been heard on 4th March 2004.
      The adjudicator dismissed the appeal but noted  in  his  determination
      that by then it was this appellant, the daughter of the  appellant  he
      was dealing with, who had an outstanding appeal.

  14. The respondent said in that letter that as the appeal  rights  of  her
      mother had now been exhausted there would be no breach  of  article  8
      because the appellant would be removed together with  her  mother.  In
      any event, it was observed that the  appellant  was  now  twenty  four
      years old and so was an adult and no longer a dependant of her mother.
      She had been living away from her mother while at university  and  had
      established her own life.

  15. The respondent noted that the appellant had now completed  her  degree
      course at Oxford University. There had been a ministerial  undertaking
      that the appellant would not be removed while her mother's appeal  was
      outstanding but as those appeal rights were now  exhausted  there  was
      nothing to prevent both  the  appellant  and  her  mother  from  being
      removed. For these reasons the respondent had  decided  to  refuse  to
      revoke the deportation order. With that letter was enclosed  a  formal
      notice of that decision, also dated 25th January 2005,  in  which  the
      appeal rights available to the appellant were set out.

The grounds of appeal.

  16. There were five grounds of appeal. These were that:


        a. the decision  was  not  in  accordance  with  the  law  and  the
           immigration rules;
        b. removal of the appellant would infringe the  appellant's  rights
           under the 1950 Convention;
        c. discretion  under  paragraph  390  of  HC395  should  have  been
           exercised differently;
        d. no or insufficient weight had been given to  the  considerations
           set out in paragraph 364 of the immigration rules;
        e. the deportation of the appellant would not be conducive  to  the
           public good.

   The hearing before the immigration judge .


  17.   The appeal came before an immigration judge on 13th  December  2005.
      He had regard to the bundle of documents submitted on  behalf  of  the
      appellant. He heard oral evidence  from  the  appellant  and  received
      submissions from the representatives. Mr Goldberg's submissions to the
      immigration judge were apparently similar to those he  pursued  before
      us. He referred to  a  wide  range  of  letters  of  support  for  the
      appellant from a number of well known and influential people, some  of
      whom had actually met her. He reminded the immigration judge that  the
      appellant had received no public funding other than, perhaps, that she
      had attended a "down  at  heel"  comprehensive  school  to  which  she
      brought the honour of her achievement of being their first student  to
      gain a place at Oxford University. She had  lost  contact  with  those
      relatives she had in Ukraine. Most of those relatives  have  moved  to
      Russia.


  18. Mr Goldberg emphasised that much had changed  since  the  decision  to
      make  a  deportation  order  was  taken  in  1999.  He  described  the
      appellant's achievements. She had excelled at  Oxford.  She  had  been
      prominent in the Oxford University Conservative Society. She had  been
      involved with the debating Society, with the dancesport team and  with
      the naval unit  at  Oxford.  She  hoped  to  follow  a  career  as  an
      intelligence officer with the Royal Navy. She  had  excelled  also  in
      music, being an accomplished pianist. He took  the  immigration  judge
      through letters of reference provided by the Oxford Radcliffe Hospital
      where  she  had  worked  as  a  personal  assistant  and  had  made  a
      significant contribution to the efficient running of clinics.

   The approach of the  immigration  judge  to  the  applicable  immigration
   rules.

  19.  The decision under appeal was that of the  respondent  to  refuse  to
      revoke the deportation order and not the decision to make  the  order.
      This is important as different considerations apply.  The  immigration
      judge, although referring to paragraphs 390 -  392,  appears  to  have
      been concerned more with a consideration of paragraph 364. In view  of
      the way in which the appeal was argued before him  this  is,  perhaps,
      not entirely surprising.


  20. Paragraph 364 is concerned with the striking of a balance between  the
      competing interests in play:

             "364. Subject to paragraph 380, in considering whether
             deportation is the right course on the merits, the public
             interest will be balanced against any compassionate
             circumstances of the case. While each case will be considered
             in the light of the particular circumstances, the aim is an
             exercise of the power of deportation which is consistent and
             fair as between one person and another, although one case will
             rarely be identical with another in all material respects. In
             the cases detailed in paragraph 363A, deportation will
             normally be the proper course where a person has failed to
             comply with or has contravened a condition or has remained
             without authority. Before a decision to deport is reached the
             Secretary of State will take into account all relevant factors
             known to him including:
             (i) age;
             (ii) length of residence in the United Kingdom;
             (iii) strength of connections with the United Kingdom;
             (iv) personal history, including character, conduct and
             employment
                 record;
             (v)  domestic circumstances;
             (vi) previous criminal record and the nature of any offence of
             which the
                 person has been convicted;
             (vii) compassionate circumstances;
             (viii) any representations received on the person's behalf."

  21.  When dealing with an  application  to  revoke  a  deportation  order,
      paragraph 390 requires that:


             "390. An application for revocation of a deportation order
             will be considered in the light of all the circumstances
             including the following:
             (i) the grounds on which the order was made;
             (ii) any representations made in support of revocation;
             (iii) the interests of the community, including the
             maintenance of an
                 effective immigration control;
              (iv) the interests of the applicant, including any
             compassionate
                 circumstances."

    But the focus of the consideration is made clear by paragraph 391 which
    provides (emphasis added):


             "391. In the case of an applicant with a serious criminal
             record continued exclusion for a long term of years will
             normally be the proper course. In other cases revocation of
             the order will not normally be authorised unless the situation
             has been materially altered, either by a change of
             circumstances since the order was made, or by fresh
             information coming to light which was not before the court
             which made the recommendation or the appellate authorities or
             the Secretary of State. The passage of time since the person
             was deported may also in itself amount to such a change of
             circumstances as to warrant revocation of the order. However,
             save in the most exceptional circumstances, the Secretary of
             State will not revoke the order unless the person has been
             absent from the United Kingdom for a period of at least 3
             years since it was made.

  22. Thus, paragraph 391 is concerned not  simply  with  a  review  of  the
      original decision to make a deportation order, unchallenged as it  was
      by this appellant at the time, but with whether, in view of  what  has
      occurred since the making of the order, there can be found to  be  the
      most exceptional circumstances such as to warrant  the  revocation  of
      the order. It is far from clear that the immigration judge had this in
      mind in reaching his decision. At paragraph 55 of the determination he
      said this:


             "There are compassionate circumstances, as set  out  above  in
             the appellant's case, as in many appeals faced by the Tribunal
             everyday. I do not consider the appellant's circumstances  are
             exceptional. They do  not  outweigh  the  public  interest  in
             having a fair but firm immigration policy. This is not a  case
             that is different from many others. I find that  there  is  no
             insurmountable obstacle to  the  appellant  returning  to  the
             Ukraine as her father lives there, and she  has  some  contact
             with him. I do not find it unreasonable in  the  circumstances
             of this appeal. She speaks the language and it is likely  that
             her mother will also be returning to the Ukraine."


  23. We are satisfied that the approach of the immigration judge was wrong.
      It is clear, from a reading of the determination as a whole,  that  he
      was carrying out a review  of  the  original  decision  based  upon  a
      consideration of the issues set out in paragraph 364 and that  he  did
      not have proper regard to the correct approach as set out in paragraph
      391.

  24. Mr Trent argued that this error of law was not  material  because  the
      error favoured the appellant. If the immigration judge  dismissed  her
      appeal on the basis of carrying out a balancing exercise having regard
      to the factors set out in paragraph 364 then he could not have allowed
      the appeal if he had adopted the correct approach of paragraph 391  as
      that required him to find the "most exceptional circumstances" such as
      to warrant revocation before he could have allowed the appeal.  We  do
      not agree. We cannot be  confident  that  had  the  immigration  judge
      adopted the correct approach and not been distracted by an examination
      of matters that were not directly relevant to  his  decision  that  he
      would necessarily have come to the same conclusions. We find that  the
      immigration judge did make a material error of  law  and  so  we  must
      substitute a fresh decision to allow or dismiss the appeal.

Consideration of the Issues

  25.  The decision to make a deportation order was made on 6th August 1999,
      just less than four months after the appellant's eighteenth  birthday.
      Paragraph 390 of the immigration rules requires that  the  application
      for revocation be considered in the light of the  grounds  upon  which
      the order was made. Those grounds included that it  was  necessary  in
      the public interest that the appellant  be  removed  from  the  United
      Kingdom. The appellant's mother, in respect of whom a decision to make
      a deportation order was made also, had appealed against that  decision
      but her appeal was dismissed by a  determination  promulgated  on  2nd
      March 2000. During the following seven months  there  was  nothing  to
      prevent the respondent from taking steps to secure the removal of  the
      appellant, and her mother, from the United Kingdom but no  such  steps
      were taken. The appellant has, throughout,  been  complying  with  the
      respondent's instructions to report each month at an agreed  reporting
      point while she remained in the United Kingdom  although,  of  course,
      not with his instruction to leave the United Kingdom.


  26. On 20th March 2003 the appellant's mother submitted an appeal on human
      rights grounds. We were told by Mr Trent that a Minister had given  an
      undertaking that the appellant would not be removed until  the  appeal
      rights of  her  mother  had  been  exhausted.   Taking  together  this
      commitment and the failure to act between March and October 2000  when
      there was no impediment to the respondent removing  the  appellant  we
      are satisfied that, in  fact,  despite  having  served  notice  of  an
      intention to make a deportation order in August 1999 at that time  the
      respondent had no intention  whatsoever  of  acting  upon  it  in  the
      foreseeable future. This finding is crucial to our decision.

  27. The consequence of the respondent's studied delay  was  to  allow  the
      appellant to make very good use indeed of her time. Having  done  very
      well in her A level examinations the  appellant  secured  a  place  at
      Exeter College,  Oxford  to  read  modern  languages.  The  offer  was
      conditional only upon funding.  We do not  know  to  what  extent  the
      admissions tutor of the College was aware that the appellant  was  not
      entitled to be in the United Kingdom to pursue the course. As overseas
      fees were to be charged, the College clearly had notice that she was a
      person who required  immigration  leave.  The  fees  were  beyond  the
      resources of the appellant and her mother but an anonymous  benefactor
      came forward and has provided something in the region  of  ï¿½30,000  to
      meet these costs.

  28. In his skeleton argument, at paragraph 6, Mr Goldberg summarised  some
      of the appellant's achievements:

             "She has taught herself perfect English despite speaking  none
             when she arrived. She has proved herself  in  all  respects  a
             model citizen and a passionate and patriotic  Anglophile.  She
             has obtained a Class 2.1 degree from Oxford University  funded
             by scholarships and private charitable donations  from  within
             this country including Lincoln Cathedral. She has excelled  in
             many fields, notably the Oxford University Royal  Naval  Unit,
             the  University  Dancesport  team,  the  Oxford   Conservative
             Association and she founded the  Oxford  University  Ukrainian
             Society. She is a valued administrator at the  John  Radcliffe
             Hospital in Oxford where she has important responsibilities in
             organising cancer clinics. She gives tutorials  part-time  for
             the University in the Ukrainian language."

  29. It is clear to us that in many ways those submissions, like those made
      to the immigration judge, greatly overstate the case.  The  allegation
      of  her  being  a  "model  citizen  and  a  passionate  and  patriotic
      Anglophile" has to be taken in the context of her not being a  citizen
      of the United Kingdom and having chosen, for the whole  of  her  adult
      life, to defy United Kingdom  immigration  law,  including  the  rules
      against her working. Her acquisition of a 2.1 degree has to  be  taken
      in the context of the fact that her studies were in languages which to
      her were native or nearly so.  The scholarship from Lincoln  Cathedral
      is a matter on which we have commented earlier in this  determination.
      We do not know the detail of her work at the  Radcliffe  Hospital:  we
      understand that she is in essence a secretary or PA and is  apparently
      working there illegally. When the issue was raised at the  hearing  it
      was not suggested that she has any permission or right  to  work.  The
      assertion made to the immigration  judge  that  the  appellant  is  an
      accomplished pianist was made to us in the form that she is a "concert
      pianist". Inquiry showed that the assertion was based  solely  on  the
      fact that she has passed grade 8 piano. Her hope "to follow  a  career
      as an  intelligence  officer  in  the  Royal  Navy"  asserted  to  the
      immigration  judge  and  orally  to  us,  appears   to   be   entirely
      unrealistic.


  30. Since the hearing it has also come to our notice that her claim to  be
      the first person from her school to have gone on to Oxford  University
      is apparently false: The Times, 16th June 2006, contains an apology to
      the school for printing it.


  31. Mr Goldberg referred also  to  a  collection  of  letters  written  in
      support of the  appellant's  case  by  a  number  of  well  known  and
      influential people. We do not find these to  be  particularly  helpful
      and do not attach very much weight to them. It appears  that  most  of
      their authors are not known to the appellant but have been  approached
      on her behalf with a request for their support. It is not possible  to
      know what these people were told of the appellant's case, whether what
      they were told was true, or whether they had  any  basis  at  all  for
      expressing a view relevant to these proceedings. It  is  difficult  to
      see how these assist the appellant. The importance of maintaining  the
      integrity of  the  immigration  rules  is  a  matter  of  the  highest
      importance. It cannot be accepted that the requirements of  the  rules
      should be waived simply because an appellant has  access  to  a  large
      number of well known people who have been persuaded by the information
      given to them, whatever that might have been, to express views in  the
      appellant's favour.


  32. We consider, then, whether the  appellant's  situation  is  materially
      different, either because of a change in her circumstances  since  the
      deportation order was made or because of the fresh  information  which
      could not have been before the respondent  in  August  1999  when  the
      decision  to  make  a  deportation  order  was  made.  Paragraph   391
      acknowledges that the passage of time might itself  be  a  significant
      factor. The question, though, is whether all this amounts to the  most
      exceptional  circumstances  that  need  to   be   established   before
      revocation is warranted.

  33. We are satisfied that the passage of time arising from the failure  of
      the respondent to act upon the deportation order has led to  a  change
      in the circumstances of the appellant that can properly be regarded as
      exceptional. The position of the appellant  becomes  most  exceptional
      when her circumstances are considered in the light of the  failure  of
      the respondent to consider any mechanism for  removal  other  than  by
      acting upon the deportation order.

  34. A person removed from the United Kingdom by  means  of  a  deportation
      order will, normally,  be  prevented  from  returning  to  the  United
      Kingdom  for  a  period  of  three  years.  This  is   of   particular
      significance in this case for the following reason. At the time of the
      original decision to remove the appellant and her mother, because both
      had  overstayed  leave  granted  to  them,  the  decision  to  make  a
      deportation order was  the  appropriate  mechanism.  By  October  2000
      Parliament had resolved that removal by deportation  order  should  be
      retained for use in respect of those  who  had  been  recommended  for
      deportation following conviction in the criminal courts and for  those
      whose deportation was deemed by the Secretary of State to be conducive
      to the public good and members of their families.  For  those  in  the
      appellant's position, who had overstayed  leave,  removal  was  to  be
      effected administratively by  the  procedure  of  section  10  of  the
      Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.  The significant benefit to those  in
      respect of whom that procedure was used was that there was nothing  to
      prevent them from making an immediate application for leave to  return
      under the rules assuming, of course, that they met the requirements of
      the particular rule under which they sought to return.


  35. As there was no intention to take  any  step  at  all  to  secure  the
      appellant's removal until after October 2000 we are satisfied that the
      Secretary of State ought to have given, at the date of the decision on
      25th January 2005, substantive consideration to the  question  whether
      deportation remained the appropriate course of  action  in  her  case.
      This question does, in fact, raise formidable questions  of  statutory
      interpretation. As we have said, deportation for overstayers ceased on
      2nd October 2000. It is the transitional  provisions  that  cause  the
      difficulty.


  36. The first issue is whether the respondent  had  any  power  after  2nd
      October  2000  to  make  a  deportation  order  on  the   grounds   of
      overstaying. We sought assistance on this issue  from  Mr  Trent,  who
      after the hearing  (with  our  permission)  made  written  submissions
      referring  in  substance  only  to  the  explanatory  notes   to   the
      commencement provisions of the Immigration and  Asylum  Act  1999.  We
      must look into the matter more deeply.


  37. The liability to deportation is and was found in section 3(5)  of  the
      Immigration Act 1971. Paragraphs 43-44 of Schedule 14 to the 1999  Act
      substituted a new version of that  section,  omitting  the  effect  on
      overstayers, whose liability to deportation  thereupon  vanished.  The
      substituted section 3(5) came into force on 2nd October 2000 by virtue
      of  the  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  1999  (Commencement   No.   6,
      Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Order 2000 (SI  2000/2444).
      The Order contains in  its  Second  Schedule  transitional  provisions
      relevant to section 3(5) of the 1971 Act and section 10  of  the  1999
      Act (which gives the new power to issue directions for the removal  of
      an overstayer) as follows:


            Transitional provisions relating to the 1999 Act
            1.  - (1) In this paragraph, a reference to a section or to a
            Schedule is to be read as a reference to a section of, or to a
            Schedule to, the 1999 Act, unless otherwise specified.

            (2) Section 10 (removal of certain persons unlawfully in the
            United    Kingdom) is not to have effect in relation to -
           a) any person on whom the Secretary of State has, before 2nd
              October 2000, served a notice of his intention to make a
              deportation order;         .....


            Transitional provisions relating to the appeals provisions of
            the 1971 Act
             2(3) Section 5 (procedure for, and further provisions as to,
            deportation) is to continue to have effect in relation to -


            (a) any person on whom the Secretary of State has, before 2nd
            October 2000, served a notice of his decision to make a
            deportation order;          ........


  38. This makes it clear that the powers for making the  deportation  order
      (under section 5 of the 1971 Act) continued to  be  available  to  the
      respondent as a result of the decision  he  made  before  2nd  October
      2000. The deportation order itself is, therefore, clearly lawful.


  39. The question then is whether, if it were revoked, the respondent would
      have any power to issue removal directions under  section  10  of  the
      1999 Act against the appellant. Paragraph 1(2)(a) of the  Schedule  to
      the Commencement Order would suggest not, and paragraph  2(3)  of  the
      same Order  would  suggest  that  deportation  would  continue  to  be
      available in her case. That  interpretation  would  be  based  on  the
      assumption that a  historic  decision  to  make  a  deportation  order
      forever singled out an individual as continuing to be subject  to  the
      deportation provisions of the 1971 Act before their amendment.

  40. We do not think that can be right. If it were, a person who  had  once
      been the subject of a pre-2000 decision to make  a  deportation  order
      against him as an overstayer would forever be subject to the  pre-2000
      law, even if the decision had been withdrawn, set aside on appeal, not
      proceeded with, or even resulted in a deportation order that had  been
      enforced, and, years later, revoked. The true position  must  be  that
      that these transitional provisions are intended to be transitional and
      not permanent: they enable the continuance of any deportation  process
      begun before 2000 but are not intended to  determine  the  immigration
      law applicable to people who  happen  to  have  been  the  subject  of
      continuing  process  on  2nd  October  2000  when  fresh   immigration
      decisions are taken after that date.

  41.  We have therefore reached the view that,  if  the  deportation  order
      were revoked, it would be open to  the  Secretary  of  State  to  give
      directions for the appellant's removal as an overstayer.

  42. For that reason we have concluded that the  exceptional  circumstances
      and history of this case are such that the proper decision would  have
      been to revoke, rather than  maintaining,  the  deportation  order  in
      January 2005. We shall therefore allow this appeal on the grounds that
      the discretion to  revoke  the  deportation  order  should  have  been
      exercised differently.

  43. We emphasise that we do not suggest that the appellant has,  or  ought
      to have, any right to remain here. It may well be that there are ample
      grounds for removing her. Further, it should be  emphasised  that  our
      decision does not give the appellant leave to remain and we should not
      be taken to imply that she should have leave. What we do say  is  that
      in her case removing her by way of deportation is not appropriate. For
      that reason only, having found that the immigration  judge  materially
      erred in law, we substitute a determination allowing this appeal.
