Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr A Sayem, instructed by Uzma Law Ltd
For the respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Mohammed Tauhidul Islam, date of birth  20.10.82,  is  a
    citizen of Bangladesh.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Moore, who dismissed his  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent, dated 21.10.13, to refuse his application made on  24.10.12
    for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur, and
    to remove him from the UK by way of directions under section 47 of  the
    Immigration Asylum and Nationality  Act  2006.   The  Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 20.5.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Cox granted permission to appeal on 30.7.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 10.9.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Moore should be set aside.

 6. For the reasons set out below, I find that the application made by  the
    appellant was doomed to failure and could not  have  succeeded  at  the
    First-tier Tribunal, irrespective of the issue of false  documents  and
    paragraph 322(1A) of the Immigration Rules.

 7. First, as  Mr  Sayem  concedes,  the  documentation  submitted  by  the
    appellant with his application did  not  meet  the  specified  evidence
    requirements of paragraph 41-SD of Appendix A.  Quite  apart  from  the
    disputed banking documents, which also fail under this  head  and  with
    which I  deal  more  particularly  below,  the  legal  representative's
    letters did not contain the prescribed information. Mr Sayem  described
    this as a minor error. However, by reason of  this  failure  alone  the
    application should have been and was refused.

 8. I reject Mr Sayem's submission that  there  is  an  issue  of  fairness
    involved in this aspect of the decision. There is nothing unfair  about
    the Secretary of State applying the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules to the appellant's application. The Secretary  of  State  is  not
    obliged to offer an applicant  a  second-bite  opportunity  to  correct
    errors in the application.

 9. Neither do I accept  the  submission  that  an  evidential  flexibility
    policy should have been  applied  to  make  further  enquiries  of  the
    appellant as to defects in the evidence submitted. It is clear from the
    current case law, including Rodriquez [2014] EWCA Civ 2, that  no  such
    policy could assist the  appellant  on  the  facts  of  this  case.  No
    evidential flexibility policy  in  relation  to  Points  Based  Appeals
    survived the introduction of paragraph 245AA of the  Immigration  Rules
    in September  2012.  245AA  does  not  assist  the  appellant,  as  the
    defective legal declaration  is  not  akin  to  one  of  the  types  of
    situations set out in 245AA  where  the  respondent  will  contact  the
    applicant  to  request  correct  omissions  in  documentation.  I  also
    particularly bear in mind 245AA(c), where the  UKBA  will  not  request
    documents where it does not anticipate that addressing the omission  or
    error would lead to a grant because the application will be refused for
    other reasons. In this case it was refused because of the submission of
    a false document. There was thus no purpose in contacting the appellant
    and for the reasons I have set out above, no requirement to  do  so  on
    the facts of this case.

10. Further, I reject the argument that the missing information could  have
    been gleaned from other documents submitted by the appellant  with  his
    application. It is not for the Secretary of State to go  digging  about
    in the documentation to try and address deficiencies in  the  evidence.
    Even if that information is available elsewhere, it  remains  the  case
    that part of the specified evidence  required  by  41-SD  includes  the
    legal representative's declaration as to the availability of the  funds
    and that this declaration must contain the  specified  information.  It
    did not and that fact cannot be gainsaid.

11. In the circumstances, the application could not possibly have succeeded
    and any appeal was doomed to failure because the  appellant  failed  to
    submit the required documentation. In relation to this issue I find  no
    error of law in the determination of Judge Moore, summarised at �27  of
    the determination, and thus ground 3 of the grounds of appeal fails.

12. In addition, the respondent contends that  the  appellant  submitted  a
    false document  and  thus  his  application  should  be  refused  under
    paragraph 322(1A) of  the  Immigration  Rules,  on  the  basis  of  the
    submission of false  documents,  whether  or  not  to  the  applicant's
    knowledge. It is necessary to demonstrate dishonesty, but not necessary
    to demonstrate that it was on the part of the appellant.

13. Ground 1 submits that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  made  unreasonable
    findings about the respondent's verification process in relation to the
    offer of �200,000 in funding from the third party. This  ground  is  in
    essence no more than a disagreement with the findings of the judge.  In
    his determination, Judge Moore grappled with  the  evidence  from  both
    sides on this issue and the submissions on  behalf  of  the  appellant,
    suggesting that there were errors in the documentation relied on by the
    Secretary of State. Having earlier summarised Mr  Sayem's  submissions,
    at �24 of the determination the judge reached the conclusion  that  the
    verification of the banking letter was properly conducted  and  at  �25
    that the  burden  of  proof  had  been  satisfied  to  demonstrate  the
    documents were false and not genuine. The judge  regarded  the  alleged
    errors in the correspondence as not significant in  the  light  of  the
    fact that the bank confirmed that the questioned  letter  was  "totally
    fake and false." The account  number  and  account  holder's  name  was
    provided. Not only was the letter false and had not been issued by  the
    bank, but there was no such employee as named  as  the  author  of  the
    letter.

14. Mr Sayem submitted that  the  judge  had  not  followed  the  case  law
    guidance of Shen (Paper appeals; proving dishonesty)  [2014]  UKUT  236
    (IAC) and Adedoyin (formerly AA (Nigeria v SSHD) [2010] EWCA  Civ  773,
    to the effect that reference to false means dishonestly  false.      In
    Shen it was held that (i) In terms of  the  approach  that  a  tribunal
    should adopt towards decisions of  the  SSHD  in  which  dishonesty  or
    deception is alleged against an applicant  for  leave  to  remain,  the
    starting point should be, as the Court of Appeal in Adedoyin  (formerly
    AA (Nigeria) v SSHD) [2010] EWCA Civ 773 have made clear, that pursuant
    to paragraph 322 of the Immigration Rules,  the  reference  to  "false"
    means "dishonestly" false; (ii) Where an application form etc is  false
    in a material way, this may be relied on by the  SSHD  as  prima  facie
    evidence establishing dishonesty. The inference of deliberate deception
    can be strengthened by other facts: e.g. if a criminal conviction  (not
    disclosed in an application) occurred shortly before completion of  the
    application form. Here, the conviction  must  have  been  high  in  the
    applicant's mind and any explanation based  on  oversight  would  carry
    little weight. But it is always open to  an  appellant  to  proffer  an
    innocent explanation and if that explanation meets  a  basic  level  of
    plausibility, the burden switches back  to  the  SSHD  to  answer  that
    evidence. At the end of the day the SSHD bears the  burden  of  proving
    dishonesty.

15. The Tribunal in Shen also held that a finding of  dishonesty  can  have
    catastrophic consequences for the  appellant  in  social  and  economic
    terms and is not to be made lightly. I have considered the treatment of
    this issue by the First-tier Tribunal. The judge took into account that
    the appellant continued to maintain that the questioned documents  were
    genuine. However, he  had  not  himself  contacted  the  bank  but  was
    allegedly relying on the assurance  of  his  cousin,  the  third  party
    financier, that the documents were  genuine.  He  also  considered  the
    appellant's additional  evidence  comprising  a  further  letter  dated
    26.1.14 confirming  the  original  letter.  The  judge  considered  but
    rejected, for cogent reasons given in the determination, the challenges
    to the verification evidence. It is clear that the judge did not accept
    that the appellant's additional  evidence  displaced  the  verification
    evidence relied on by the Secretary of State to  the  effect  that  the
    documentation was false and had never been issued by the bank.  At  �29
    of the determination, the judge was satisfied that  the  appellant  had
    used false representations in the submission of  false  documents  with
    the application, whether or not he personally knew that  the  documents
    were false.  Paragraph  322(1A)  does  not  require  the  appellant  to
    personally know that the documents were false. In the circumstances,  I
    find no error of law in the judge's treatment of this issue.

16. Finally, criticism is made of  the  judge's  findings  in  relation  to
    article 8 private life (the appellant laying no  claim  to  any  family
    life in the UK). The judge considered Mr Sayem's  submissions  on  this
    issue but at �28 did not agree that the appellant's private life rights
    would be infringed. The judge pointed out that the appellant has had no
    legitimate expectation to remain in the UK on  the  conclusion  of  his
    studies. The only basis of a private life would  be  on  the  basis  of
    residence in the UK since 2009, as a student. Those  studies  have  now
    concluded. In the light of Patel and  Nasim,  there  is  no  basis  for
    considering the appellant has any private  life  sufficient  to  engage
    article 8.

17. In Patel [2013] UKSC 72 Lord Carnwath said:

          "55.    Thus the balance drawn by the rules may be relevant to the
         consideration of proportionality......

         56.  Although the context of the  rules  may  be  relevant  to  the
         consideration of proportionality....this cannot be equated  with  a
         formalised "near-miss" or "sliding scale" principle.....Mrs Huang's
         case for favourable treatment outside the rules did not turn on how
         close she had  come  to  compliance  with  rule  317,  but  on  the
         application of the family values which underlie that rule  and  are
         at the heart of article 8. conversely, a near-miss under the  rules
         cannot provide substance to a human rights case which is  otherwise
         lacking in merit.

         57.  It is important to remember that Article 8 is  not  a  general
         dispensing power. It is to be distinguished from the  Secretary  of
         States' discretion to allow leave  to  remain  outside  the  rules,
         which may be unrelated to any protected human right...."

18.  The  facts  of  Patel  &  others  are  worth  summarising.  Mr  Alam's
    application for leave to remain as a  Tier  4  student  under  the  PBS
    system  was  refused  as  he  had  failed  to  provide   the   relevant
    documentation with his application.  By  the  time  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal appeal he had produced  qualifying  bank  statements  but  the
    Tribunal held that they were excluded  from  consideration  by  section
    85A, but went on to regard the evidence as relevant to  article  8  and
    found the decision disproportionate on the basis that the appellant now
    met the requirements of the Rules.  The  Upper  Tribunal  reversed  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal, finding that the judge  had  erred
    in treating the new evidence as effective compliance with the Rules for
    the purpose of article 8. The Supreme Court  considered  that  the  new
    evidence could not be excluded insofar as it related  to  human  rights
    grounds and article 8  considerations,  and  could  take  the  evidence
    outside the scope of exception 2 in section 85A. However, on the  facts
    of the case, the Supreme Court found no error in the  approach  of  the
    Upper Tribunal, as there was little merit in the article 8 claim,  even
    if some weight was given to the unusual circumstances in which he  lost
    his ability to rely on the new evidence, because of  when  section  85A
    came into force. The evidence did not significantly improve  the  human
    rights case and there is no near miss or sliding scale principle to  be
    applied.


19. In Nasim and others (article 8) [2014]  UKUT  00025  (IAC),  the  Upper
    Tribunal considered whether the hypothetical  removal  of  the  22  PBS
    claimants, pursuant to the decision to  refuse  to  vary  leave,  would
    violate the UK's obligations under article 8  ECHR.  Whilst  each  case
    must  be  determined  on  its  merits,  the  Tribunal  noted  that  the
    judgements of the Supreme Court in Patel and Others v SSHD [2013]  UKSC
    72, "serve to re-focus attention on the nature and purpose of article 8
    of the ECHR and, in particular, to  recognise  that  article's  limited
    utility in private life cases that are far removed from the  protection
    of an individual's moral and physical integrity." Presence  in  the  UK
    for the purpose of study by itself does not give rise to a private life
    sufficient  to  engage  article  8  so  as  to  render   the   decision
    disproportionate.


20. I further notice that at �28 Judge  Moore  considered  the  appellant's
    private life under paragraph 276ADE, noting  that  he  could  not  meet
    those requirements and that  there  were  no  compelling  circumstances
    justifying consideration of article  8  ECHR  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The  appellant  failed  to  demonstrate  any  such   compelling
    circumstances and neither was Mr  Sayem  able  to  point  to  any  such
    compelling circumstances. In the circumstances, there was no  error  of
    law in failing to consider the  appellant's  private  life  further  by
    reference to the Razgar five steps. However, I am satisfied  that  even
    if the judge had done so, it is inevitable on the facts  of  this  case
    that  the  conclusion  would  be  that  the   decision   was   entirely
    proportionate and not disproportionate to the appellant's private  life
    rights. Article 8 is not a shortcut to compliance with the  Immigration
    Rules. The fact the appellant was unable to demonstrate compliance with
    the Rules  and  that  false  documents  had  been  submitted  with  the
    application  would  weigh  heavily  against  the   appellant   in   any
    proportionality balancing exercise. In the  circumstances,  I  find  no
    error of law in the judge's treatment of the appellant's  private  life
    claim under article 8 ECHR.


Conclusions:

21. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.
