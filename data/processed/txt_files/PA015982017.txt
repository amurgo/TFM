               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr T Ruddy, of Jain, Neil & Ruddy, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Blair, promulgated on 6  April  2017,  dismissing  his  appeal  against
    refusal of asylum on grounds of lack of credibility.

 2. The grounds, put shortly, are these:

      (1).  At �21 the judge discounted the appellant's evidence that he did
      not ask the head of the gurdwara in Kabul, Avatar Singh, to  send  him
      letters from the Taliban which led to his flight, due to the  cost  of
      $160.00, when he had been able to pay the costs of fleeing to the  UK.
      This ignored the submission that the appellant, being  in  receipt  of
      NASS support, had been accepted by the respondent as destitute.

      (2) and (6).  At �22 the judge held as adverse  the  lack  of  contact
      with Avatar Singh, who had assisted in the family's flight, to let him
      know  they  had  reached  safety.   This  overlooked  the  appellant's
      evidence that although he did not have the number of Avatar  Singh  he
      had the number of Mituh Singh and had communicated with him, with  the
      effect that news must also have reached Avatar Singh.

      (3). Also at �22, the judge mixed  up  the  identities  of  Mituh  and
      Avatar Singh.

      (4).  At �23, the judge  found  that  the  appellant  could  not  have
      maintained to the Muslim partner of Monmohan Singh for 3 � years while
      working in their business a pretence that he, the appellant,  was  the
      brother of Monmohan Singh.  The judge was wrong in thinking  that  the
      evidence was that the partners were  friends.   Fair  notice  was  not
      given of the issue, and if it  had  been,  the  appellant  would  have
      explained that Monmohan Singh did have a brother, who  left  the  area
      some years before.

      (5) At �26, the judge  made  a  negative  finding  about  the  Taliban
      sending a second  threatening  letter,  but  failed  to  consider  the
      submission that it was well within judicial knowledge that the Taliban
      do send such "night letters".

      (7).  The judge found it adverse that they appellant's  wife  did  not
      know how long it took her husband to get from the gurdwara [where they
      lived] to his shop, an error in absence  of  evidence  that  she  ever
      travelled from the gurdwara to the shop.

      (8).  At � 24, 25 and 29 the judge made adverse findings based on  the
      appellant's wife not being aware of his belief that his parents  might
      have come to the UK the day after they and their daughter did, and not
      knowing whether the appellant  had  spoken  to  her  about  where  his
      parents might be.  She had not been asked whether the appellant  spoke
      to her about that.  His evidence was based on his  understanding  from
      an agent, and he did not know their actual whereabouts.

      (9).  At �30 the judge found the  evidence  of  the  appellant's  wife
      about her mother, father and two brothers unsatisfactory, but gave  no
      reasons.

      (10).  This ground overlaps with others, directs their criticisms also
      against �31, and says that the judge failed to outline what  more  the
      appellant could reasonably be expected to have done to  find  out  the
      whereabouts of his parents.

      (11).  The judge's conclusions at �33 and 34 are affected by  all  the
      foregoing errors.  The judge at �20 had upheld a submission that  some
      of the respondent's points in the refusal letter were unreasonable.

 3. As framed, the grounds are only a series of selective disagreements  on
    the facts.  They disclose no case that the decision, read fairly and as
    a whole, is wrong as a matter of law.

 4. As developed in submissions by Mr Ruddy,  however,  the  case  for  the
    appellant in the UT was that significant  findings  were  made  in  the
    appellant's favour at �20 on the essence of his  case,  but  the  judge
    then overlooked that, and made a handful of adverse findings,  none  of
    them said to be wholly irrational, but all of them said to be weak  and
    peripheral, which even cumulatively did  not  add  up  to  adequacy  of
    reasoning.

 5. The respondent's position was that the appellant's argument  read  more
    into �20 than was justified; it was in the appellant's favour  on  only
    two points; the judge's reasons were all valid; the adverse points  did
    go to the essence of the appellant's account; and no more was disclosed
    than disagreement on the facts.

 6. I reserved my decision.

 7. The judge at �20 said:

         "On the adverse points in the refusal letter, in many respects  the
         account of the appellant was consistent and I agree with  Mr  Ruddy
         that it  was  unreasonable  of  the  respondent  to  criticise  the
         appellant for example for not knowing the details of the fraud  (to
         which he was not a party) and [for] assuming the Taliban would  not
         take action within Kabul. It is  well  known  that  although  at  a
         general level the authorities have control in Kabul on a day-to-day
         basis the Taliban are still active and can  still  commit  crimes."



 8. There is in that passage a finding that the  appellant's  evidence  was
    largely self-consistent, and the phrase "for example" is  available  to
    counter the respondent's argument that it is  favourable  only  on  the
    issues of (1) knowledge of the fraud and (2) the reach of  the  Taliban
    in Kabul.  However, it is not a broad finding in the appellant's favour
    or a forgotten point of departure.  It is a statement of points already
    in issue which are resolved in  the  appellant's  favour,  followed  by
    negative findings at �21 - 31.

 9. I do not find that any of those findings have individually  been  shown
    to be wrong in fact or in law.

10. The appellant's evidence was that the family had funds  to  enable  his
    parents, himself,  his  wife  and  their  daughter  to  flee  from  the
    Afghanistan to the UK, an expensive exercise.  Receipt  of  NASS  funds
    (based on self-declaration  of  destitution)  does  not  undermine  the
    judge's finding that the relatively low cost of transmission was not  a
    good  explanation  for  not  obtaining  potentially  important  written
    evidence.

11. It might be read into the evidence that news of the family's arrival in
    a place of safety might indirectly reach  their  benefactor,  but  that
    does not undermine the sense of the point that in a  true  account  the
    appellant would surely  have  been  anxious  to  communicate  with  him
    directly and certainly.

12. The confusion at one point over the  identities  of  Mituh  and  Avatar
    Singh is immaterial (as Mr Ruddy acknowledged).

13. The judge was entitled to find it unlikely that  a  pretence  of  being
    brothers was unlikely to have been maintained successfully to  a  close
    associate over a long period.

14. A judge must evaluate the case  which  the  appellant  chooses  to  put
    before him. Every adverse view  does  not  have  to  be  intimated  for
    further comment, a process which could become never-ending.

15.  The  judge  did  not  overlook  the  Taliban's  practice  of   sending
    threatening letters.  He was entitled to  find  it  unlikely  that  the
    Taleban would send a second letter, giving  the  give  the  family  the
    opportunity to flee, rather than taking drastic action.

16. It is within reason to think that the  appellant's  wife,  living  with
    him, would likely know the length of his daily journey to work.

17. The evidence from the appellant and his wife about the  whereabouts  of
    their respective families was plainly self-contradictory, and the judge
    was entitled to find it unsatisfactory  and  unreliable.  There  is  no
    absence of reasoning in that respect; the contradictions were set  out,
    and spoke for themselves. These matters are not peripheral but bound to
    be of  huge  human  importance,  integral  to  the  claim  of  enforced
    departure.

18. Mr Ruddy has pressed as far as possible to turn  disagreements  on  the
    facts into error of law, but that was based on reading  more  into  �20
    than it properly bears.  The decision has not been shown to be  a  less
    than legally adequate explanation to the appellant of why  he  has  not
    been established his case.

19. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

20. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
