Representation:
Appellant     Mr Bates (Home Office Presenting Officer)
Respondent    Mrs Ali, Counsel, instructed by Shehzard Law Chambers


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent in these proceedings was the appellant before the First-
    tier Tribunal. From hereon I have referred to the parties as they  were
    in the First-tier  Tribunal  so  that  for  example  reference  to  the
    respondent is a reference to  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department.


 2. The appellant, citizen of Pakistan, applied on November  29,  2013  for
    leave to remain in the United  Kingdom.  The  respondent  refused  this
    application on April 9, 2015 and the appellant appealed  on  April  22,
    2015 under section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002.

 3. The appeal  was  heard  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Lever
    (hereinafter referred to as "the Judge") on November 24, 2015 and in  a
    decision promulgated on December 4, 2015 he dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal under the Immigration Rules but allowed his appeal under article
    8 ECHR.


 4. The respondent appealed that decision  and  permission  to  appeal  was
    granted by Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Grant.  The  appellant's
    solicitors filed a Rule 24 response on June 6, 2016 and the matter  was
    listed before me on the above date.

 5. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I make no order now.

    SUBMISSIONS


 6. Mr Bates adopted the grounds of  appeal  and  argued  the  Judge  erred
    because he wrongly found there were exceptional circumstances to enable
    him to consider the appeal outside of  the  Rules.  The  Judge  further
    erred in his assessment of proportionality because he failed to  attach
    sufficient weight to the fact the relationship was formed in precarious
    circumstances. Following the decision in Rajendran (s117B-family  life)
    [2016] UKUT 000138 (IAC) he submitted little weight  should  have  been
    attached to the appellant's family  life.  The  Judge  also  failed  to
    attach weight to the fact that the  appellant's  wife's  children  were
    having regular contact with their father and lived with him for part of
    the time. Too much weight was attached to the  appellant's  involvement
    with the children when in fact he had only been involved since  January
    2013 whereas their father continued to be involved despite the fact  he
    and the appellant's wife had separated. The Judge placed weight on  the
    fact the appellant's wife could not increase her hours but there was no
    evidence she had sought a better job or a second job. In paragraph [33]
    the Judge placed weight on the fact the  appellant  spoke  English  but
    this was not a positive factor but at best a neutral factor. In  short,
    the Judge erred by finding the children were an exceptional  reason  to
    allow the appeal outside the Rules.

 7. Mrs Ali relied on the Rule 24 letter and  her  skeleton  argument.  She
    submitted the Judge had the advantage over us  because  he  heard  live
    evidence from the appellant and his wife. Based on what  he  heard  and
    read he concluded there  were  exceptional  circumstances.  Whilst  she
    accepted contact between the children continued with their  father  Mrs
    Ali submitted that the appellant's relationship with his wife  and  her
    children had been ongoing since 2009. The appellant's wife and children
    were British and the Judge had taken this and all  other  factors  into
    account when he considered proportionality. The decision  he  made  was
    one that was properly reasoned and open to him.


 8. Mr Bates responded and submitted the Judge erred by failing to  provide
    adequate reasoning.

 9. Having heard their submissions, I reserved my decision.

    DISCUSSION AND FINDING ON ERROR IN LAW

10. The appellant entered the United Kingdom as a student on May 11,  2008.
    His leave was extended to enable him to continue his studies as a  Tier
    4 student until February 3, 2014. On November 29, 2013 he submitted his
    application to remain. Mrs Ali accepted, when the appeal was  heard  in
    the First-tier Tribunal, that  the  appellant  could  not  satisfy  the
    requirements of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules because  they  did
    not meet the financial requirements laid down in  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules.


11. Having had the opportunity to see and hear the appellant and  his  wife
    give evidence the Judge found them to be in a  genuine  and  subsisting
    marriage and credible witnesses.


12. At paragraph [23] the Judge then approached the issue  of  whether  the
    Immigration Rules were  a  complete  code  and  at  paragraph  [24]  he
    reminded  himself  of  the  factors  he  should  have  regard  to  when
    considering whether there were  exceptional  circumstances  that  would
    enable him to consider the appeal outside of the Immigration Rules.


13. The Judge at paragraph [25] found that  the  appellant  had  been  here
    lawfully at all times and quite properly stated that being  married  in
    itself would not amount to exceptional circumstances. However, he  then
    identified exceptional  circumstances  allowing  him  to  consider  the
    appeal outside of the Rules. These factors were set out  in  paragraphs
    [27] to [29] and in summary were:


      a. The appellant's wife's  family  live  in  the  United  Kingdom  and
         although she is of Pakistani origin she is  a  woman  with  western
         values who has not lived in Pakistan and she would not find it easy
         to integrate.
      b. It was unrealistic to expect the  children  to  reside  with  their
         father if the appellant and his  wife  went  to  Pakistan.  It  was
         neither in their best interests nor reasonable.
      c. It was unrealistic to expect the children to relocate  to  Pakistan
         as this separate them from their natural father and it  would  mean
         British citizens, one of whom was fifteen, would have to leave  the
         United Kingdom and in this case that would not be appropriate.
      d. The appellant's wife would  not  be  able  to  meet  the  financial
         threshold because even if she worked full-time in her  current  job
         she could not earn the appropriate salary.


14. For these reasons the Judge found he was able to consider a claim under
    article 8 ECHR and at paragraph [31] of his decision he made  it  clear
    that he regarded this case as an exceptional case.


15. Mr Bates has submitted  the  Judge's  approach  was  flawed  but  I  am
    satisfied despite the arguments advanced by Mr Bates that the Judge was
    entitled to consider  this  appeal  outside  of  the  Rules.  Whilst  a
    different Judge may not have reached the same conclusion nothing in  Mr
    Bates's submissions persuades me that the Judge erred in  reaching  the
    conclusion that he should consider the claim outside of the Rules.


16.  In  granting  the  respondent  permission  to   appeal   it   is   the
    proportionality element that was  the  primary  reason  for  permission
    being granted.


17. The Judge correctly identified that it was the fifth question in Razgar
    [2004] UKHL  00027  that  needed  careful  consideration.  He  reminded
    himself that Section 117B of the 2002 Act had to be considered  and  in
    allowing the appeal the Judge gave weight to the following matters:


      a. The appellant's ability to speak English.
      b. The appellant had integrated to some extent.
      c. The family are self-sufficient.
      d. He had been in the United Kingdom lawfully but  with  a  precarious
         immigration status.
      e. Both children had a close relationship with the appellant and  that
         the appellant acts a father figure.
      f. Separation from their father would be significantly detrimental.
      g. Genuine and subsisting marriage  and  not  entered  into  with  any
         cynical or ulterior motive.
      h. The stability and well-being of the children is an important factor
         as is the promotion of the marriage between the appellant  and  his
         wife.
      i. No reasonable evidence that the marriage could exist outside of the
         United Kingdom.
      j. Separation of the appellant from his wife would  permanently  break
         up a marriage.


18. The Judge found the appellant's ability to speak English was a positive
    factor but it cannot be said he  allowed  this  appeal  based  on  that
    factor alone.


19. The Judge recognised his immigration status  was  precarious  but  felt
    there  were  other  factors  that  counter  balanced  the  respondent's
    concerns and that was a finding open to him.


20. The Judge was fully aware of the breakdown of  the  appellant's  wife's
    first marriage and the contact arrangements. He concluded the  children
    would lose out seeing their father if they went to leave in Pakistan.


21. The Judge considered the  financial  outlook  and  concluded  that  the
    appellant's wife would be unlikely to meet the �18,600 requirement.  He
    attached weight to the fact she had made enquiries about extending  her
    hours at work.

22. All of the arguments advanced by Mr Bates were proper arguments to make
    but they amount to  mere  disagreements  in  this  particular  case.  A
    different Judge may have given those arguments more weight and possibly
    reached a different decision but despite Mr  Bates's  best  efforts  to
    suggest otherwise I am satisfied his arguments do not identify an error
    in law.


23. I therefore refuse his application to set aside the Judge's decision.

    DECISION


24. There was no material error in respect of article 8 and  I  uphold  the
    Judge's decision.
