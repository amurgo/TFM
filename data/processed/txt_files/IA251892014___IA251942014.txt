Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr C Jowett instructed by Permits2Work Limited


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/2698) I make an anonymity order to protect the  anonymity
    of JI who is a child.  Unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  or  court  directs
    otherwise, no report of these proceedings shall directly or  indirectly
    disclose the identity of the respondents (KDBI and JI).  This direction
    applies to both the appellant and to the respondents and a  failure  to
    comply with this direction could lead to Contempt of Court proceedings.

 2. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State, for convenience I
    will refer to the  parties  as  they  appeared  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Introduction

 3. The first appellant ("A1"), who was born  on  23  March  1991,  is  the
    mother of the second appellant ("A2") who was born on 18 November 2007.
     They are both citizens of the Philippines.  In January  2011,  A1  met
    the sponsor, "MS" who is a British citizen.  On  27  August  2013,  A1,
    together with A2, obtained visas to enter the UK on the basis  that  A1
    was the fiancï¿½e of the sponsor.   A1  and  A2  entered  the  UK  on  13
    February 2013.  On 13 February 2014, A1 married the sponsor.

 4. Thereafter, on 25 April 2014 A1 applied for further leave to remain  as
    the spouse of the  sponsor  under  Appendix  FM.   A2  applied  as  her
    dependent.  On 29  May  2014,  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  A1's
    application for further leave on the basis that she could not meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules in particular as a partner  under
    R-LTRP.  A1 could  not  establish  that  she  satisfied  the  financial
    requirement based upon the income of the sponsor and, in substitute for
    that, there were not "insurmountable obstacles" to A1 and  the  sponsor
    continuing  their  family  life  in  the  Philippines  such  that   the
    requirements of EX.1  were  not  met.   The  Secretary  of  State  also
    concluded that A1 could not  rely  upon  para  276ADE  based  upon  her
    private life and  that  there  were  no  exceptional  circumstances  to
    justify the grant of leave outside the Rules.  As  a  consequence,  the
    Secretary of State made a decision to refuse to extend A1's  leave  and
    also to remove her by way of directions under s.47 of the  Immigration,
    Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 5. As regards A2, on 29 May 2014  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  A2's
    applications for further leave under the Rules as a  "child"  under  R-
    LTRC of Appendix FM on the basis that A1 had been refused leave and  so
    the requirement in R-LTRC.1.1(d)(iii) was not satisfied.   Further,  A2
    did not meet the requirements of para 276ADE  based  upon  his  private
    life.  As a consequence, the Secretary of State  refused  to  grant  A2
    further leave to remain and also made the decision to remove him by way
    of directions under s.47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act
    2006.

The Appeals

 6. A1 and A2 appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Their  appeals  were
    initially heard by Judge O'Rourke.  In a determination  promulgated  on
    23 January 2015, Judge O'Rourke dismissed A1 and A2's appeals under the
    Immigration Rules but allowed their appeals under Art 8.

 7. The Secretary of State appealed Judge O'Rourke's decision to the  Upper
    Tribunal.  In a decision promulgated  on  24  August  2015,  the  Upper
    Tribunal (UTJ Finch)  allowed  the  Secretary  of  State's  appeal  and
    remitted the appeals of A1 and A2 to the First-tier Tribunal for  a  de
    novo rehearing.

 8. The remitted appeals were listed before Judge  Suffield-Thompson  on  7
    January 2016.  At that hearing, A1 and A2 relied upon A1's claim  under
    the Rules as the "partner" of the sponsor in section R-LTRP and outside
    the Rules under Art 8.

 9. In her decision promulgated on 19 January 2016, Judge Suffield-Thompson
    found that the appellants could not establish the requirement  in  EX.1
    that there were  "insurmountable  obstacles"  to  A1  and  the  sponsor
    continuing their family life in the Philippines.  Having done  so,  the
    judge went on to consider whether the appellants  could  succeed  under
    Art 8  outside  the  Rules.   She  found  that  their  removal  to  the
    Philippines would breach Art  8  as  it  would  be  a  disproportionate
    interference of the private and family life of A1, A2 and the sponsor.

10. As a result, the judge allowed the appeals of A1 and A2 under Art 8.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

11. The Secretary  of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  the  decision
    allowing each of the appellants' appeals  under  Art  8  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

12. The grounds raised essentially three  points.   First,  the  judge  had
    failed to give  any  reasons  in  para  50  of  her  determination  for
    concluding  that  the  removal  of  A1  was  "not   a   legitimate   or
    proportionate one".  Secondly, the judge had failed  to  give  adequate
    reasons at paras 60 and 61 of her determination for concluding that  it
    was not in the best interests of A2 to return to the  Philippines  with
    his mother  and  the  judge's  finding  that  such  would  be  "grossly
    disproportionate" was wholly irrational.  Thirdly, the judge had failed
    to carry out a meaningful balancing exercise as required by  s.117B  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the "NIA  Act  2002")
    having due regard to the public  interest  in  maintaining  immigration
    control.

13. On 8 June 2016 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  M  Davies)  granted  the
    Secretary of  State  permission  to  appeal  on  all  grounds  but,  in
    particular, made reference to the third point raised by  the  Secretary
    of State in relation to s.117B of the NIA Act 2002.

14. On 22 July 2016, the appellants filed a rule  24  response  seeking  to
    uphold the judge's decision to allow the appeals of A1 and A2 under Art
    8 on the basis that she had not erred in law in reaching her  decision.



15. Thus, the appeals came before me.

The Judge's Decision

16. The judge's determination, running to some 63 paragraphs, has  a  clear
    and well-defined structure.  The appellants relied upon the Immigration
    Rules in  particular  the  'partner'  route  under  section  R-LTRP  of
    Appendix FM and the  'child'  route  in  R-LTRC  of  Appendix  FM.   In
    essence, A2 could only succeed if his mother qualified for leave  under
    the 'partner' route.  It does not appear that a claim  based  upon  the
    appellants' private life was relied upon under para 276ADE.

17. In essence, as the judge concluded, A1's success  under  the  'partner'
    route depended upon the application of EX.1, in particular EX.1(b) that
    she has a genuine and subsisting relationship with the sponsor who  was
    a British citizen and that  there  were  "insurmountable  obstacles  to
    family life with [the sponsor] continuing outside the UK".

18. Having set out the evidence of the A1 at para 14 and of the sponsor  at
    para  15  and  having  set  out  the  parties'  respective  cases   and
    submissions at paras 16-23, the judge dealt  with  the  application  of
    EX.1 at paras 38-40 as follows:

         "38.     The Sponsor is a man of 66 years of age  and  despite  the
             way that the Appellants' representative presented their case I
             find that 66 is not a great age.  He is still able to work and
             live independently from his first family.  He has a few  minor
             health issues such as some arthritis in his knee and neck  and
             he was clearly able to visit the Philippines when he was first
             in a relationship with the Appellant.  He may  have  found  it
             hot but there is  no  evidence  before  me  that  he  has  any
             specific medical condition that will make him ill in the  heat
             and there is air conditioning available  in  many  houses  and
             flats there, which was confirmed by the first Appellant in her
             oral evidence.

         39.  The Appellant argues that the Sponsor will have  to  sell  his
             home here in the UK if he moves.  There is nothing to stop him
             doing this and he can use any equity he has  left  to  buy  or
             rent a home in the Philippines.  He states he could not afford
             to do this and  yet  he  had  made  no  enquiries  as  to  how
             expensive it would be to rent a house there, or how  much  his
             medicine would cost.  However he receives ï¿½590  per  month  in
             pensions so that is income the family would have available  to
             them there as the cost of living is far lower there than it is
             in the UK.  His wife is much younger and it would be perfectly
             possible for her to work and he could stay at  home  and  mind
             his young step-son.  As his  health  issues  are  not  serious
             there is nothing to suggest he would have to seek  significant
             amounts of medical care other than to buy  his  medicines  and
             have the odd check-up.

         40.  I accept that the Appellants and Sponsor do  not  want  to  go
             back to the Philippines and that there would be  upheaval  and
             initial difficulties moving back  there  but  I  do  not  find
             anything that leads me  to  conclude  that  EX.1  is  met  for
             Appellants or the Sponsor and that the problems put forward by
             the Appellant amount to insurmountable obstacles."

19. Consequently, the judge concluded that neither A1 nor A2 could  succeed
    under the Rules.

20. The judge then went on to consider whether the appellants could succeed
    under Art 8 outside the Rules.  At para 44 the judge  referred  to  the
    five steps in Razgar and  found  that  the  appellants'  removal  would
    engage Art 8.1 on the basis of the interference with their family life.
     The judge recognised, and it was not  disputed  before  me,  that  the
    central question was that of proportionality.

21. The judge then dealt with the position of the sponsor,  A1  and  A2  in
    turn.

22. At paras 46-48, the judge  dealt  with  the  position  of  the  sponsor
    including the impact of him  moving  to  the  Philippines  with  A1  as
    follows:

         "46.     In relation to the Sponsor I find as follows.  The Sponsor
             is 66 years of age and has lived in the UK all  of  his  life.
             He had a family prior to meeting the first Appellant.  He  has
             two sons and five grandchildren who he sees weekly and who are
             a huge part of his life here in the UK.  He owns his own  home
             which is still subject to a mortgage.  He  works  in  a  self-
             employed capacity and support the Appellants financially.   He
             is not dependent on state aid.

         47.  He has made it very clear in his  oral  and  written  evidence
             that he could not and would not go to the Philippines  if  his
             wife and step-son had to return.  He is  concerned  about  his
             health and his finances and most significantly  his  other  UK
             family.  He does not feel  he  could  afford  to  support  the
             family if he moved there.  He  would  lose  his  self-employed
             contracting work that he does here in the UK.  He  has  health
             issues and does not feel that living in a climate as  hot  and
             humid as the Philippines would be a  positive  thing  for  his
             health.  Most significant for him however is the  relationship
             he has with his first family.  He is clearly very close to his
             two sons and their children and he has the  grand-children  to
             stay every weekend.  He could not afford to pay  for  them  to
             visit him if he left the UK and he would not  be  prepared  to
             renounce the family he has here.  In  the  case  of  Marckx  v
             Belgium (1979) 2 EHRR 330 it was held  that  family  life  was
             held to include the ties between near relatives and any  other
             family member who may play a considerable part in  the  family
             life which in this case I find is the  Sponsor's  family  from
             his previous marriage.

         48.  As a British Citizen, with all the rights  and  benefits  that
             that bestows upon him, he cannot be forced to  leave  the  UK.
             If the Appellants leave the UK and he remains here  then  that
             would effectively bring about the end of  his  marriage  which
             would, I find be in breach of his Human Rights."

23. Then at paras 49-50 the judge dealt with the  circumstances  of  A1  as
    follows:

         "49.     In relation to the first Appellant I find as follows.  The
             Appellant came to the UK on a  valid  visa  and  she  and  her
             Sponsor complied with all the Rules at the time.   Since  then
             there have been some difficulties with  their  finances.   The
             Appellant has been here lawfully and her status has only  been
             precarious in that her remaining  here  relies  on  a  further
             application but for no other reasons.  She is a person of good
             character and has no criminal convictions.  She and her family
             are self-supporting and she makes no demands financially  upon
             the state.  The Appellants case has to be  considered  in  the
             light of section 117B and I find as follows.

         50.  The Appellant speaks excellent  English,  she  has  been  here
             legally throughout her time here in the UK  and  her  stay  is
             precarious only in that she has to make  another  application.
             She and her husband are self-supporting and do not  depend  on
             the state for their  income.   She  has  no  criminal  record.
             Therefore the only issue in this case is that of the weight of
             immigration control against the Appellant's right  to  respect
             for her family life.  After due consideration I find  that  in
             this appeal the weight of the  balancing  act  lies  with  the
             Appellant and that her right to respect for  her  family  life
             outweighs the Respondent's aim to control immigration.  I find
             the  decision  to  remove  her  is   not   a   legitimate   or
             proportionate one."

24. Finally, the judge dealt  with  the  position  of  A2  at  paras  51-61
    including setting  out  the  relevant  law  in  s.55  of  the  Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 and relevant case law in  relation
    to the determination of the "best interests" of a child and  that  they
    were a "primary" consideration although not determinative.

25.  At  para  51  the  judge  set  out  the  background  for  A2  and  his
    circumstances as follows:

         "51.     I now turn to the second Appellant.  He  came  to  the  UK
             when he was 6 and has now been here for two and a half  years,
             a significant time in the  life  of  a  young  child.   He  is
             clearly attached to his stepfather and that was apparent  from
             the way they interacted at court.  His mother has said in  her
             evidence that he is now very close to his step-father's grand-
             children and that he is happy and  settled  at  school  and  I
             accept that evidence as truthful."

26.  Having  referred,  in  some  detail,  to  the  leading  cases  of   EV
    (Philippines) and Others v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 874,  Azimi-Moayed  and
    Others [2013] UKUT 197 (IAC),  E-A  [2011]  UKUT  00315  (IAC)  and  ZH
    (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4, the judge again  turned  to  the  A2's
    circumstances at paras 59-60 as follows:

         "59.     With  these  cases  in  mind  I  turn  to  the  individual
             situation of the second Appellant.  He  was  born  on  the  18
             November 2007 making him now 8.  He  has  spent  the  first  6
             years of his life in the Philippines.  He now lives  with  his
             mother and step-father with whom he has developed close  bond.
             He has formed a  close  relationship  with  his  step-father's
             grandchildren and the other adults in the family (see the case
             of Pawandeep Singh v ECO New Delhi [2004] EWCA  Civ  1075  and
             IAS 4 December 2004).  In R (on the application  of  Ahmadi  v
             SSHD EWCA Civ 1721 and LU 15.2.06 and 2006 INLR  318,  a  case
             which involved two Afghan siblings who  had  recently  started
             living together in the UK.  The  CA  said  that  the  question
             under Article 8 had to be  considered  in  the  light  of  the
             potential for their family life together and not just  in  the
             context of what had existed for a short time in the past.  The
             Court of Appeal said that there was ample  authority  for  the
             proposition that Article 8 required  the  state  not  only  to
             refrain from interference with existing family life, but  also
             not to inhibit the development of  real  family  life  in  the
             future.  This is key in this case  in  that  he  has  now  the
             opportunity to create a large and happy family life whereas in
             the  Philippines  he  would  just  have  his  mother  and  his
             stepfather.

         60.  He attends a local  primary  school  and  there  are  letters,
             certificates and  reports  before  the  Tribunal  (Appellant's
             bundle pages 106-130) from the school about his progress.  The
             representative for the Respondent submits that because he  has
             found it hard at the start  to  settle  into  school  and  has
             struggled with the language that this means it  will  be  less
             traumatic for him to be uprooted again and  moved  back  to  a
             school in the Philippines.  I do not find this to be the case.
              It is clear from his achievement certificates and the  school
             reports that he has now settled in well  and  is  working  and
             trying hard and doing very well in school.  Coming to  the  UK
             at 6 would have been a huge upheaval for him and this was  one
             that he clearly found  traumatic.   He  is  now  settled  with
             friends, relatives of his own age who he  sees  every  weekend
             and a new stepfather with whom he has  a  close  and  positive
             relationship.  I cannot find that it is in his best  interests
             to be taken out of his school and his home, away from his  new
             family and friends to go back to  the  Philippines  where  his
             mother will have to go to work full time leaving  him  without
             her support in the face of another traumatic move in his  very
             young life.  I find it is overwhelmingly in the best interests
             of the second Appellant to remain in the UK but of course with
             his mother.  I find that is would be entirely disproportionate
             for the second Appellant to be removed from the UK and that in
             this case his interests far outweigh the public policies  that
             the Respondent seeks to maintain and that it would  not  be  a
             legitimate interference in the life of the second Appellant."

27. At para 61, the judge stated her ultimate decision in  the  appeals  as
    follows:

         "61.     In the light of the above cases and the  individual  facts
             pertaining to this particular Appellant I  find  it  would  be
             grossly disproportionate and totally contrary to his emotional
             stability and welfare if he were to be removed from his  home,
             school and family here in the UK.  The appeal is allowed."

The Respondent's Case

28. Mr Richards, on behalf of the Secretary of State criticised the judge's
    reasoning in para 50 where she had concluded that the removal of the A1
    would not be proportionate.   He  submitted  that  the  judge  had,  in
    effect, identified a number of "positive" aspects  of  her  case  under
    s.117B of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  but,  he
    submitted, she had failed to take into account the  'negative'  factors
    reflected in the public interest in effective  immigration  control  as
    set out in s.117B(1) of the NIA Act 2002.   There  was,  he  submitted,
    simply no effective balancing exercise carried out in determining  that
    A1's removal would be disproportionate.

29. Secondly, Mr Richards criticised the judge's reasoning in  relation  to
    the second appellant at para  51  onwards  in  her  determination.   He
    submitted that the judge had failed to give any or any adequate reasons
    for finding that it was not in the best interests of A2 to move to  the
    Philippines with his mother and that that  would  be  disproportionate.
    The judge had given no reason for finding that it  would  be  traumatic
    for him to do so after two years in the UK.  Mr Richards submitted that
    it was fairly common place for children to be taken out of  school  and
    to move away from their extended family.  The judge was wrong simply to
    assume that a young child who had already moved across the  world  once
    could not move again when  he  would  be  doing  so  with  his  mother.
    Further, Mr Richards criticised the judge's  reasoning  that  A1  would
    have to go out to work and that she would therefore have to leave A2 as
    the family had sufficient income to support  themselves.   Mr  Richards
    submitted that the judge's finding in respect of  A2's  best  interests
    and that his removal would be disproportionate was wholly irrational.

Discussion

30. The judge correctly approached Art 8 applying the well-known two  stage
    process:  First, considering whether the appellants could succeed under
    the Immigration Rules, and secondly, if they could not,  whether  there
    were compelling circumstances, not adequately dealt with in the  Rules,
    to outweigh the public interest and justify the grant of leave  outside
    the Rules (see Singh and Khalid v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 74).  I did  not
    understand Mr Richards to submit otherwise.  There was, of  course,  no
    challenge to the judge's finding that the appellants could not  succeed
    under the  Immigration  Rules  on  the  basis  that  it  had  not  been
    established there were "insurmountable obstacles" to the A1 and sponsor
    carrying on their family life in the Philippines or  that  para  276ADE
    applied.

31. There is, in my judgment, at the  heart  of  Mr  Richards'  submissions
    three underlying points.  First, by compartmentalising consideration of
    the circumstances of the sponsor, A1 and A2, the judge  has  failed  to
    adequately consider and give reasons for her findings.  Secondly, there
    is simply an inadequate consideration of the public interest  including
    s.117B  of  the  NIA  Act  2002.   Thirdly,   the   judge's   findings,
    particularly  in  relation  to  A2,  are  inadequately   reasoned   and
    irrational not least because they are difficult to  sustain  given  the
    judge's  finding,  in  relation  to  the  Rules,  that  there  were  no
    "insurmountable  obstacles"  to  the  sponsor  and  A1  living  in  the
    Philippines.

32. Dealing first with the issue of compartmentalisation, it would,  as  Mr
    Jowett  submitted,  be  wrong  to  read   passages   in   the   judge's
    determination in isolation.  The judge's determination must be read  as
    a whole and on the basis  that  the  judge  had  the  totality  of  the
    evidence and her findings in mind when she was making findings first in
    relation to the sponsor, secondly in relation  to  A1  and  finally  in
    relation to A2.

33. Consequently, in reading paras 49-50 of the judge's  determination  and
    her conclusion that A1's  removal  would  not  be  proportionate,  that
    finding has to be seen in the light of the findings the judge  made  in
    respect of the sponsor and, in particular, in respect  of  A2  and  his
    best interests.  Whilst it might have been stylistically more appealing
    if the judge had considered the  situation  of  the  three  individuals
    together before setting out individual conclusions in  respect  of  the
    breach of Art 8, I agree with Mr Jowett that, at its heart, this  is  a
    criticism relating to the judge's style rather than  the  substance  of
    the decision.  It is the substance of her decision and the reasons that
    she gives in paras 43-61 read as a whole which must  determine  whether
    her reasons were adequate and whether her findings were sustainable, in
    particular based upon a proper consideration of the public interest and
    reaching a rational conclusion in relation to A2's best interests.

34. Turning to the first of those issues, namely the public interest, I  do
    not accept Mr Richards' submission that the judge has  failed  to  have
    proper regard to  the  public  interest,  in  particular  in  effective
    immigration control as set out in s.117B(1) and, therefore, has  failed
    to carry out the required balancing exercise for proportionality.

35. Although the judge identifies, what Mr  Richards  characterised  as,  a
    number of "positive" factors in para 50, she did not do  so  so  as  to
    omit to consider the public interest set out in s.117B(1) in  effective
    immigration control.  What the judge does in para 50 is recognise  that
    A1 speaks excellent  English  and,  in  effect,  therefore  the  public
    interest factor in s.117B(2) is not engaged.  Likewise, in  recognising
    that A1 and the sponsor were financially "self-supporting"  the  public
    interest recognised in s.117B(iii) was not engaged.  It  was  simply  a
    truism  to  state  that  A1's  immigration  position  in  the  UK   was
    "precarious".  Whilst that was relevant to the weight to be given to  a
    claim based on "private life" (see s.117B(5)), it would only be  if  A1
    was in the  UK  "unlawfully"  that  it  would  have  relevance  to  her
    relationship with the  sponsor  who  is  a  "qualifying  partner"  (see
    s.117B(4)).  The judge, perhaps in terms that could have been expressed
    a little more, noted in para 50 that the issue was  the  weight  to  be
    given  to  "immigration  control"  in  balancing   that   against   the
    appellants' right to respect for family life.

36. Mr Richards accepted in his oral submissions that  the  judge  had  had
    regard to s.117B.  That is, in my judgment, undoubtedly the case.   The
    judge did not, as Mr Richards submitted, move  simply  from  concluding
    that none of the public interest factored in  s.117B(2),  (3)  and  (4)
    were engaged to finding that therefore there was no public interest  to
    balance against the appellants'  circumstances.   The  judge  expressly
    engaged in that task.  Neither did the Judge wrongly equate  theses  as
    positive factors which diluted the public interest (see AM [2015]  UKUT
    260 (IAC) and Rhuppiah v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 803).

37. The Judge's reasons for reaching the finding in  respect  of  A1  must,
    however, be taken  together  with  her  assessment  and  conclusion  in
    respect of the position of  A2  and  his  best  interests.   Are  those
    reasons adequate and is the judge's conclusion irrational?  Mr Richards
    submitted that the judge had failed in both regards.

38. As regards the judge's reason in finding that it was not  in  the  best
    interests of A2 to move to the Philippines, Mr  Richards  challenged  a
    number of the judge's conclusions in paras  59  and  60.   It  was  not
    suggested that the judge had misdirected herself in law in  determining
    A2's best interests.  To do so would, in my judgment, be an  unenviable
    uphill struggle given the judge's careful  and  detailed  citation  and
    reference to the relevant case law at paras 52-58.  It was not,  in  my
    judgment, pure speculation for the judge to find in para 60  that  A2's
    move back to the Philippines would be traumatic and  not  in  his  best
    interests.  The evidence before the judge, which she did not doubt, was
    that A2 was close to not only his stepfather in the  UK  but  also  his
    stepfather's grandchildren.  He had settled in school and  had  friends
    and had settled into a stable life in the UK.  A1's evidence  was  that
    it would be a huge upheaval for him to return to the Philippines.  I do
    not accept that the judge's finding in relation to the effect  upon  A2
    was pure speculation.  It was founded in evidence before the judge and,
    as such, is sustainable unless the conclusion was irrational.  That  is
    a high hurdle indeed to satisfy in relation to a factual finding and is
    not, in my judgment, made out in respect of  the  judge's  findings  in
    paragraph 60.

39. Mr Richards placed some reliance upon the fact that the judge had found
    that there  were  no  "insurmountable  obstacles"  to  A1  and  sponsor
    carrying on their married  life  in  the  Philippines.   That  was,  of
    course, a finding under the Immigration Rules.  That  finding  was  not
    determinative  of  whether  any  interference  with  family  life   was
    proportionate (see R (Agyarko and Others) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 440 at
    [21]-[30]).  Whilst relevant, "compelling" circumstances may arise in a
    precarious family life case (such as the present  appeals)  even  where
    there are no insurmountable obstacles to  the  family  life  continuing
    abroad (see, in particular, [24] and [30]).  Here, it is clear that the
    judge approached the impact upon A2 and his best interests on the basis
    that he would have "his mother and his stepfather" in  the  Philippines
    (see para 59 of the determination).

40. It may well be that not every judge would have decided that  A2's  best
    interests were to remain in the UK with his mother.  However, that does
    not demonstrate that the finding was irrational,  namely  one  that  no
    reasonable judge could have reached  that  finding  properly  directing
    themselves.

41. In Mukarkar v SSHD [2006] EWCA Civ 1045, Carnwath LJ (as he  then  was)
    said this at [40]:

         "Factual judgments ... are often not easy, but they  are  not  made
         easier or better by excessive legal or linguistic analysis.  It  is
         the nature of such  judgments  that  different  Tribunals,  without
         illegality or irrationality, may reach different conclusions on the
         same case ... the mere fact that one Tribunal has reached what  may
         seem an unusually generous view of the facts of a  particular  case
         does not mean that it has made an error of law ..."

42. There was evidence before the judge, which she was entitled to  accept,
    that the financial position of the family would be  such  that  in  the
    Philippines A1 would have to work and that this would  have  an  impact
    upon A2.  Even if that  is  a  not  uncommon  life  situation,  it  was
    nevertheless a matter which the judge could  take  into  account.   The
    real import, however, of the judge's reasoning is the  impact  of  A2's
    "upheaval" having settled in the UK with a new  family.   Even  if  his
    stepfather would move to the Philippines, on which there  was  evidence
    before the judge that there would be difficulties  for  his  health  in
    doing so, nevertheless the judge's finding  in  respect  of  A2's  best
    interests was not, in my judgment, irrational  in  the  sense  that  no
    reasonable judge could have reached such a finding.

43. Looking at the circumstances of the sponsor, on which, as I have  said,
    there was evidence concerning the impact upon his health, and those, in
    particular, of A2, the judge was entitled,  in  my  view,  to  reach  a
    finding that the public interest was outweighed.  The reasons  for  her
    finding are set out  with  sufficient  clarity  that,  on  reading  her
    determination, it is clear why she found that the removal  of  both  A1
    and A2 was disproportionate.  Bearing in mind Carnwath LJ's reminder in
    Mukarkar, I am unable to conclude that, having taken into  account  the
    public interest, the judge's findings were irrational.

44. I am satisfied that the Secretary of State's grounds (amplified  by  Mr
    Richards in his submissions) do not establish any error of law  in  the
    judge's decision.

Decision

45. Thus, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow the  appeals  of
    A1 and A2 under Art 8 of the ECHR did not involve a making of an  error
    of law.  The First-tier Tribunal's decision stands.

46. Accordingly, the appeal of the Secretary of State to the Upper Tribunal
    is dismissed.
