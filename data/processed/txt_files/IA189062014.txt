                            DECISION AND REASONS


Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal or a
Court directs otherwise, no report of these proceedings or any form of
publication thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the original
appellant or his child sibling. This direction applies to, amongst others,
all parties. Any failure to comply with this direction could give rise to
contempt of court proceedings.

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Cameroon and her  date  of  birth  is  18
    July 1980.

2.   On 24 December 2013 the appellant made an application for a  derivative
    residence card pursuant to Regulation 15A of the Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("2006 Regulations").  This application
    was refused by the Secretary of State on 11 April 2014.   The  decision
    maker concluded that there was insufficient evidence to show  that  the
    appellant's British citizen children JM  (date  of  birth  24  February
    2011) and MM (date of birth 5 October 2012) would be unable  to  remain
    in the United Kingdom or EEA if the appellant was forced to leave.  The
    decision maker stated that the appellant had not provided  evidence  to
    explain why the children's father, BT is not in a position to care  for
    the children should she be forced to leave. There has to date  been  no
    decision to remove the appellant

3.   The appellant appealed against the decision of the Secretary  of  State
    and her appeal was dismissed by a panel comprising Judge of the  First-
    tier Tribunal Froom and Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Kennedy, under
    the EEA Regulations and Article 8 in a decision that was promulgated on
    18 November 2014 following a hearing on 3 November 2014.

4.   The appellant appealed against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    and permission was granted on 23 January 2015 by Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Foudy.  Thus the matter came before me on 8  April  2015.
    On this occasion I adjourned the  error  of  law  hearing  for  reasons
    explained below.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

5.   The First-tier Tribunal heard evidence from the appellant and  BT.   It
    is necessary for me to set out relevant parts of the determination:

         "2.  The background to this case has to be set out in detail.   The
             appellant claims to have entered the  UK  clandestinely  on  1
             August 2010.  She had previously  been  in  France  where  she
             obtained a Belgian identity card  in  the  name  of  SM.   She
             attempted to use this to travel to the UK  but  was  prevented
             from doing so.  On being apprehended she  gave  another  false
             name, M, which she had also used when applying for a UK  visit
             visa in 2007.  Having entered the UK illegally and been served
             with a notice of liability to removal, the  appellant  claimed
             asylum on the basis she was at risk in  Cameroon  because  she
             was a lesbian.  The respondent refused her application and the
             First-tier Tribunal dismissed her appeal.  In a  determination
             promulgated  on  18  January  2011,  Judge  Nicholls  was  not
             satisfied that CM born on 18 July  1980  was  the  appellant's
             true identity, that she was ever detained or tortured  by  the
             Cameroonian  police,  that  she  was  ever  in  a   homosexual
             relationship in Cameroon or that she was in truth  a  lesbian.
             He found her not credible and rejected  the  entirety  of  her
             account.  Remarkably, in our view, there is no mention in  the
             determination of the fact the appellant was in the ninth month
             of her pregnancy at the time of the hearing.

         3.   No steps appear to have been taken to  remove  the  appellant.
             She gave birth to a  son  [JM],  on  24  February  2011.   Her
             subsequent application for a  derivative  residence  card  was
             refused on 23 July 2013 because she failed to provide evidence
             of nationality.  She gave birth to  a  daughter,  [MM],  on  5
             October  2012.   On  24  December  2013   she   made   another
             application for a derivative residence card.  The reasons  for
             refusal letter which accompanied the notice of decision, dated
             8 April 2014, acknowledged that the appellant's  children  are
             British  citizens.   However,  the  application  was  rejected
             because the appellant had not provided evidence as to why  the
             children's father, [BT], was not in a  position  to  care  for
             them if the appellant had to leave the UK.   Matters  such  as
             [BT's] unwillingness or work commitments could  not  be  taken
             into account.  Furthermore, the appellant had not  established
             she was the 'primary carer' of the children  by  showing  they
             lived with her, that she made the day to day  decisions  about
             them and was financially responsible for the.

         10.  The appellant adopted her witness statement.  This states that
             [BT] claimed asylum.  He was subsequently  granted  indefinite
             leave to remain in 2004 and naturalised in 2007.   He  is  the
             father of both [JM] and [MM].   She  does  not  say  when  she
             started  her  relationship  with  [BT]  but  she  states  they
             separated approximately three  months  after  [JM]  was  born.
             Around  December  2011  they  attempted   to   resolve   their
             differences but separated again in  February  2012,  by  which
             time she was pregnant with [MM].   Since  the  separation  the
             children  have  always  lived  with  her.    She   is   solely
             responsible for their upbringing and day to  day  care.   [JM]
             started at nursery school in September 2014.  [MM] will  start
             next September. [BT] has regular  contact  with  [JM]  and  he
             visits both children on average once  every  two  months.   He
             occasionally gives her money for their upkeep.  NASS pays  the
             rent and provides financial support.  [BT]  lives  in  a  one-
             bedroom property which he rents in Leeds.  He works full-time.
              He has told her he  would  not  be  able  to  cope  with  the
             children.  She does not believe their needs would  be  met  by
             him.

         11.  In cross-examination the appellant  was  challenged  over  her
             failure to disclose her relationship with [BT] at her previous
             appeal, at which she had maintained that she  was  a  lesbian.
             However, she denied she had been lying.  She was  asked  about
             her separation from [BT].  She said it was when [JM] was three
             months'  old.   She  said  they  restarted  the  relationship,
             although  they  did  not  live  together.   She   specifically
             confirmed they were still in a relationship now.   She  agreed
             the reason they did not live together as a family was that his
             job was in Leeds.  The reason she did not join  him  in  Leeds
             was that he did not have enough space  in  his  accommodation.
             She said she saw him about once a month.  He gave her sums  of
             �50 or �100 occasionally.  Re-examined,  the  appellant  again
             confirmed she is currently in a relationship with  [BT].   She
             said they would make plans to live together in the future  but
             she would not be drawn about when that might take place.

         12.  [BT] also adopted his witness statement.  This also gives  the
             impression the couple separated in February  2012  since  when
             they have not resumed their relationship although he sees  the
             children in London.  He  fears  that,  if  he  had  to  assume
             responsibility for the children, they would be neglected.   He
             does not have space for them and he has two jobs.  He says  he
             has lost all his ties with Cameroon and cannot return there as
             he regards the UK as home.

         13.  Cross-examined, [BT] said  it  was  impossible  to  find  work
             nearer to where the appellant and  the  children  are  living.
             Asked why the appellant had not joined him in  Leeds  he  said
             they were no longer in a relationship.   When  told  that  the
             appellant had said they were, he seemed nonplussed.   He  said
             they were in contact  for  the  sake  of  the  children.   Re-
             examined he described their  relationship  as  that  of  close
             friends.

         15.  Having considered all the available evidence with care we have
             made the following findings.  The appellant is a person  whose
             evidence must be approached with considerable  circumspection.
             She has a history of seeking to enter the UK by deception  and
             using multiple identities when it suits her purposes.   Having
             entered clandestinely she claimed asylum on  a  factual  basis
             which  was  found  by  Judge  Nicholls  to  be  wholly  false.
             Although she denied  lying  about  her  reasons  for  claiming
             asylum her position was untenable given the fact she had  been
             in a relationship with [BT] for at least nine  months  by  the
             time of the hearing.  Given she was claiming to be  a  lesbian
             we  infer  that  the  reason  she  made  no  mention  of   her
             relationship or advanced pregnancy  was  to  avoid  having  to
             reconcile that with her claimed sexual orientation.  We regard
             her as manipulative.

         16.   In  the  circumstances  that  there  was  an   irreconcilable
             inconsistency between the appellant and  [BT]  as  to  whether
             they are still in a relationship,  we  are  unable  to  attach
             weight to anything we were told  regarding  the  relationship.
             We considered whether  the  appellant  had  been  confused  or
             perhaps the meaning of the word 'relationship' had become lost
             in  translation.    However,   the   appellant   had   several
             opportunities to amend her evidence and even confirmed  it  in
             re-examination.   We  therefore  regard  the  discrepancy   as
             unexplained and highly damaging  to  the  credibility  of  the
             appellant's case.

         17.  In the light of these matters,  whilst  we  find  it  is  more
             likely than not that the appellant is the  children's  primary
             carer as she is their mother  and  [BT]  appears  to  live  in
             Leeds, we are unable to accept that [BT] would not look  after
             his children such that they would be unable to reside  in  the
             UK if the appellant were required to leave.  We infer from our
             rejection of the claim to be contrary that he would.

         19.  We found propositions (iv), (v) and (vi) [paragraph  18  of  R
             (Sanneh) v SSWP and HMRC [2013] EWHC 793] particularly helpful
             to our understanding in this case.  It is a question  of  fact
             whether the children in this case would not be able to  reside
             in the UK if the appellant were to leave.  It is not a  matter
             of convenience, diminution of quality  of  life  or  practical
             difficulties but rather of compulsion.

         20.  As said, we are nowhere near to accepting the account given by
             the appellant in view of  the  unsatisfactory  nature  of  the
             evidence.  Even if we took her claim  that  [BT]  believes  he
             could not cope with the children, has a small flat  and  works
             full-time at face value, we would still  be  unpersuaded  that
             the test was met.  We would not be satisfied that [BT] was not
             willing or able to make suitable care  arrangements  if  there
             were no other alternative.  This would be less than ideal from
             the children's point of view and we  must  regard  their  best
             interests as a primary consideration.  Their  interests  would
             probably be better  served  by  having  both  parents  around,
             whatever the exact nature of their current  relationship,  and
             the attachment to  their  mother  is  plainly  of  very  great
             significance at their current ages.   However,  many  children
             are brought  up  successfully  by  single  parents.   [BT]  is
             established in work  and  accommodation.   He  is  an  English
             speaker.  We see no reason he could not care for his children,
             even if this led to some diminution in the  quality  of  their
             lives.

         21.  We repeat that the paucity  of  reliable  evidence  about  the
             family  make-up  has  made  it  impossible  to   reach   clear
             conclusions about the factual background.  What  is  clear  is
             that the test involves a high threshold and the appellant  has
             not discharged the burden of proving the facts  on  which  she
             needs to rely.

         24.  In Harrison (Jamaica) v SSHD [2012] EWCA  Civ  1736  Elian  LJ
             indicated that,  in  situations  such  as  the  present  case,
             article 8 rights may come into the picture to  protect  family
             life and Hickinbottom J indicated that a breach of  article  8
             might be such as to  bring  about  circumstances  which  would
             compel the  EU  citizens  to  leave.   We  therefore  turn  to
             consider article 8.

         25.  We see no inconsistency in this  approach.   Our  decision  in
             relation to Regulation  15A  is  that  the  children  are  not
             compelled to leave as a result of the appellant's removal  and
             therefore the  appellant  is  not  entitled  to  a  derivative
             residence card.  We are now considering  what  the  impact  of
             removal is on family life in the  event  the  appellant  might
             choose to take the children with her."

6.   The panel made the above findings in relation to the EU law  ground  of
    appeal.  In relation to Article 8 they made the following findings:

         "27. The appellant's case was argued on the basis that removing the
             appellant would  interfere  with  her  family  life  with  her
             children whose best interests were  a  primary  consideration.
             Much reliance was placed on the case of ZH  (Tanzania)  [2011]
             UKSC 4, given some similarities on the  facts.   Mrs  Widdison
             did not attempt  to  argue  that  the  appellant  could  bring
             herself within the applicable rules which now operate so as to
             apply article 8.

         33.  We are obliged to assess the public  interest  in  removal  by
             reference to primary legislation in the form of  section  117B
             of the 2002 Act, which was  inserted  by  section  19  of  the
             Immigration Act 2014 with effect from 28  July.   The  section
             sets out the applicable public interest  considerations  which
             must be considered when applying article 8.2.   These  include
             the following:

                  '(6) In the  case  of  a  person  who  is  not  liable  to
                      deportation, the public interest does not require the
                      person's removal where -

                      (a)  the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
                           relationship with a qualifying child, and

                      (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect  the  child
                           to leave the United Kingdom.'

         34.  Section 19 only amends the 2002 Act, not the EEA  Regulations,
             but we cannot conceive that a person bringing an appeal  under
             the latter should be treated differently.  It  is  clear  that
             [JM] and [MM] are 'qualifying  children'  under  section  117C
             (1).  The appellant is not liable to deportation.   The  issue
             is whether subsection 117B(6)(b) applies.  If so, we must have
             regard to it when considering the public interest question, as
             we must to subsections 117B(1) to (5).  We would have  reached
             the same conclusion whether or not the section applies  in  an
             EEA appeal.

         35.  There is  self-evidently  family  life  here  which  would  be
             affected by the appellant's removal.   In  this  case,  it  is
             appropriate to move straight to the last of the five questions
             identified in paragraph 17 of Razgar,  that  is,  whether  the
             refusal of leave to enter or remain, in circumstance where the
             life of the family (or  private  life)  cannot  reasonably  be
             expected to be enjoyed elsewhere, taking full account  of  all
             considerations weighing in favour of the  refusal,  prejudices
             the family life (or private life) of the applicant in a manner
             sufficiently serious to amount to a breach of the  fundamental
             right protected by article 8 (see Huang  and  Kashmiri  [2007]
             UKHL 11, paragraph 20).  A fair balance must be struck between
             the  rights  of  the  individual  and  the  interests  of  the
             community.  However, decisions taken pursuant  to  the  lawful
             operation of immigration controls will be proportionate except
             in a small minority of exceptional cases,  identifiable  on  a
             case by case basis (Razgar, paragraph 20).

         36.  Having assessed  the  evidence  and  balanced  the  respective
             interests of the parties, including the  matters  set  out  in
             section  117B,  we  have  concluded  that  the  decision,   in
             consequence of which the appellant can be removed, amounts  to
             a proportionate exercise of immigration control in furtherance
             of the legitimate aim identified, which in this case would  be
             preserving the economic wellbeing of  the  UK.   The  decision
             does not amount to a disproportionate  interference  with  the
             appellant's fundamental rights, even taking into  account  the
             right to family life of her partner, if that is  what  he  is,
             and the best interests of the children, both of which we  have
             considered.

         37.  We find subsection 117B(6) does not carry decisive  weight  in
             this appeal because we find it would  be  reasonable  for  the
             children to accompany their mother to Cameroon.  We confirm we
             have had  regard  to  the  summary  of  the  applicable  legal
             principles set out in paragraph 10 of Zoumbas  v  SSHD  [2013]
             UKSC 74.  In light  of  our  finding  by  inference  that  the
             appellant is likely to have a home and close family members to
             return to in Cameroon, there is no reason  the  children,  who
             are currently aged only 3 and 2 years, would not  be  able  to
             adapt to life in Cameroon  with  their  mother.   We  are  not
             seeking to 'punish' the children  for  the  actions  of  their
             mother.  They are entirely innocent.  Nor do we  overlook  the
             fact they are British, which was a matter of some significance
             in the reasoning in ZH (Tanzania), although  the  children  in
             that case were much older.  Article 8 must be  forward-looking
             and, even though the exercise of  the  rights  of  citizenship
             currently has relatively little meaning for the  children,  in
             the future it would count for a great  deal,  at  least  while
             they remain dependent on parental care, particularly in  terms
             of their education.  We were not told of  any  health  issues.
             We  give  the  children's  right  of  citizenship  significant
             weight.  However, it is not a decisive factor which must  lead
             inexorably to a decision in favour of the appellant (see,  for
             example, AF v SSHD [2013] CSIH 88).

         38.  Given the paucity of reliable evidence in  this  case  we  are
             unable to reach any firm conclusions about the precise  extent
             of [BT's] role in the children's lives.   We  have  found  the
             appellant is a primary carer.  It is likely responsibility  is
             shared to some extent, perhaps equally.  [BT] may have claimed
             asylum but  he  has  not  shown  he  was  successful  in  that
             endeavour and we see no reason he could not visit his children
             in Cameroon and maintain contact through the usual means.

         39.  We have reminded ourselves of the former President's  guidance
             on the best interests principle provided in the case of Azimi-
             Moayed  and  Others  (decisions  affecting  children;   onward
             appeals) [2013] UKUT 00197 (IAC), which  was  decided  on  its
             unusually weak facts.  The Upper Tribunal pointed out that, in
             the generality of cases,  it  is  in  the  best  interests  of
             children to have both stability and continuity of  social  and
             educational provision and the benefit of  growing  up  in  the
             cultural norms of the society to which they  belong.   Lengthy
             residence in a country can lead to the development of  social,
             cultural and educational ties that it would  be  inappropriate
             to disrupt but what amounts to lengthy residence is not  clear
             cut.  Past and present policies have identified seven years as
             a relevant period.  Seven years from the age of four is likely
             to be more significant to a child than the first  seven  years
             of life.  Very young children are  focused  on  their  parents
             rather than their peers and are adaptable (see paragraph  13).
             We believe that [JM] and [MM],  being  only  very  young,  are
             readily  adaptable.   They  have  not  yet   commenced   their
             mainstream  education.   We  assume  their  mother-tongue   is
             French.

         41.  The children would not experience any  separation  from  their
             mother in the scenario we are positing and we were  told  that
             they only have limited contact with their father  at  present.
             They would doubtless miss  that  contact  in  the  event  they
             relocate to Cameroon but the impact would be far less than  if
             they lost contact with their mother.  We  are  satisfied  that
             the best interests of the children are adequately protected in
             this way.  We do not need to consider the alternative scenario
             whereby the appellant chooses to leave  them  with  [BT].   We
             find that the appellant is unlikely to do so unless  she  were
             satisfied they would be adequately cared for.

         42.   The  best  interests  of  the  children  are   an   important
             consideration and, indeed, a primary consideration.   However,
             they are not a 'trump card' and this case can be distinguished
             from ZH  (Tanzania)  on  its  facts.   The  appellant  has  an
             appalling immigration history and there is substantial  public
             interest  in  ensuring   she   is   removed.    Her   personal
             circumstances and those  of  her  children  and  [BT]  do  not
             outweigh the public interest in this case.  Put  another  way,
             the decision as it stands does not produce unjustifiably harsh
             consequences  and  the  outcome  does  not  breach  article  8
             rights."

Grounds of Appeal and Submissions

7.   The grounds seeking leave to appeal are  insufficiently  particularised
    and conflate EU law and Article 8.  I adjourned the hearing on 8  April
    2015 because I wanted  written  submissions  from  both  parties  about
    whether or not the  First-tier  Tribunal  should  have  considered  the
    appeal under Article 8 on the basis that the children would  remain  in
    the UK.  The matter was adjourned until 24 June 2015.   Both  Mr  Ilyas
    and Ms Holmes submitted written  submissions  in  accordance  with  the
    directions that I gave at the  previous  hearing.  Mr  Ilyas's  written
    submissions were a vast improvement on the grounds and  helped  clarify
    issues.   I heard extensive oral submissions from both parties.

Conclusions

Credibility Findings

8.   It is argued in the grounds that the panel  misread  the  determination
    of Immigration Judge C J E Nicholls which led to unfairness.   Reliance
    is placed upon MM (unfairness; E and R) Sudan [2014] UKUT 105 (IAC),  R
    (Iran) and Ors v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 982, and E and R  v  SSHD  [2004]
    EWCA Civ 49.  It is asserted that  the  rejection  of  the  appellant's
    account and that of BT stemmed from this mistake.   The  mistake  being
    that the panel at [2] found that it was remarkable  that  there  is  no
    mention in Judge Nicholls' determination of the fact that the appellant
    was in the ninth month of pregnancy at the time of  the  hearing.   The
    panel went on to find at [15] that the appellant's evidence was  to  be
    treated with "considerable circumspection" and that it regarded her  as
    "manipulative". Mr Ilyas referred  me  to  [8(f)]  of  Judge  Nicholl's
    determination which records  the  appellant's  evidence  that  she  was
    pregnant and the anticipated date of delivery was 21 February 2011.  It
    is obvious the panel overlooked this. However, I  do  not  accept  that
    this led to fairness or adverse consequences  for  the  appellant.   Mr
    Ilyas submitted that if it were not for the mistake the Tribunal  would
    not have made adverse credibility findings in relation to the appellant
    and to BT.  I totally reject this proposition because there  were  many
    reasons given  by  the  Tribunal  at  [15]  for  concluding  that  this
    appellant's   evidence   should   be    treated    with    considerable
    circumspection.  Not only were there  significant  adverse  credibility
    findings made by Judge Nicholls (who rejected  the  appellant's  asylum
    claim as wholly false), but the appellant and BT's evidence was  wholly
    at odds  about  the  fundamental  issue  of  whether  they  were  in  a
    relationship or not. It is unarguable  that  the  mistake  resulted  in
    unfairness to the appellant.

EU Law

9.    It  is  argued  that  the  evidence  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    established that the children would  be  compelled  to  leave  the  UK.
    Reliance is placed on the judgment in Hines v LB  Lambeth  [2004]  EWCA
    Civ and MA and SM (Zambrano: EU children outside EU) Iran  [2013]  UKUT
    00380.  It is argued that BT's evidence was that  he  is  incapable  of
    looking after the two children and that there was  in  this  case  more
    than a suggestion of incapability but a clear unwillingness on his part
    to play an active role in his children's lives thus far.  It was argued
    that the case of S (A child) [2010[ EWCA Civ 705 clarifies the position
    that there is no power which allows a court to impose provisions as  to
    one parent "caring for" or "having care of" a  child  in  the  form  of
    contact order.  BT cannot be compelled to look after his children if he
    does not wish to do so.

10.  It was for the appellant  to  establish  that  the  children  would  be
    unable to reside in the UK if she was required  to  leave.   The  panel
    considered the case of R (Sanneh) v  SSWP  and  HMRC  [2013]  EWHC  793
    (Admin) at [18] of the determination.  Even where  a  non-EU  ascendant
    relative is compelled to leave the EU territory, the Article 20  rights
    of an EU child will not be infringed  if  there  is  another  ascendant
    relative who has the right of residence in the UK and who can, and will
    in practice care for the child.   BT  produced  a  very  brief  witness
    statement dated  25  October  2014  which  was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  and  in  that  statement  he  maintained  that  it  would  be
    impossible for him to look after the children because, he is  incapable
    of looking after two young children, it was never his intention to take
    the children with him when he and their mother separated and  he  fears
    that they would be neglected  if  he  were  to  assume  responsibility.
    Finally, in his view it is  natural  for  children  to  be  with  their
    biological mother.  His evidence was that he lives  in  a  one  bedroom
    flat with a very small front room and he does not have  any  space  for
    the children.

11.  There is a letter from BT to the respondent  of  14  December  2013  in
    which he maintains that he is certain that he would not be able to cope
    with two young children and that he would be concerned that they  would
    be taken away from him.  There  is  a  letter  from  Kingsley  Chambers
    representing the appellant to the respondent of 17 December  2013.   In
    this letter it is maintained that BT would not be able to  assume  care
    responsibilities for his children as he feels that he would not be able
    to cope with the children on his own and that the children belong  with
    their biological mother.  It is further asserted that it would  not  be
    suitable to BT to assume responsibility, although it cannot  be  argued
    that he has expressed an unwillingness to look after the children,  but
    he would not be able to. This is in stark contrast to the position  put
    forward by Mr Ilyas which is that BT was not only unable to but he  was
    unwilling to look after the children.

12.  The panel rejected the evidence  that  BT  would  not  look  after  his
    children in the event of their mother's removal.  The panel  stated  at
    [20] that they were "nowhere near to accepting the account given by the
    appellant in view of the unsatisfactory nature of her  evidence.   They
    stated at [20] that they would not  be  satisfied,  even  if  they  had
    accepted the evidence, that BT was not willing or able to make suitable
    care arrangements for the children.  They accepted  it  would  be  less
    than ideal, but they could see no reason why he could  not  look  after
    the children even if this led to some  diminution  in  the  quality  of
    their lives.  In the light of the  evidence,  this  decision  that  the
    children would not be compelled to leave the  UK  was  inevitable.  The
    panel did not accept that BT would refuse or be unable to take care  of
    the children, this was not the evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal
    in any event.   They did not accept that the appellant had  established
    that the lives of the children would be  seriously  impaired  and  that
    they would effectively be compelled to leave the UK.  The decision must
    be viewed in the context of  the  unsatisfactory  evidence  before  the
    Tribunal and the serious adverse credibility findings and the inability
    of the panel, in the light of this, to make  "firm  conclusions"  about
    BT's role in the lives of his children.

Article 8

13.  The appellant was not able to meet the requirements of the  Immigration
    Rules.  It is not the appellant's case now that she and  BT  are  in  a
    relationship  (despite  her  oral  evidence   before   the   First-tier
    Tribunal).  In any event, it was not accepted that he would be able  to
    meet the maintenance requirements of the Rules.  If the  appellant  was
    able to meet the Rules relating to limited leave to remain as a  parent
    (and it is not clear that she would) she would  then  have  to  satisfy
    EX.1.  The Tribunal found that the appellant could not  satisfy  276ADE
    (see [31]). In terms of  reasonableness  the  panel  properly  directed
    itself in relation to section 117B (6) (b) of  the  2002  Act.  It  was
    argued by the appellant before the First-tier Tribunal that section 117
    of the 2002 Act does not apply to cases  under  the  2006  Regulations.
    This is a misconceived argument. It applies so  far  as  article  8  is
    concerned. In any event, the panel having considered section 117B  (6),
    stated at [34] that whether or it applied they would have  reached  the
    same conclusion. No point was taken by Mr Ilyas on the issue.   In  any
    event, I am satisfied that reasonableness was properly considered.

14.      The First-tier Tribunal did not determine Article 8  on  the  basis
    that the children would remain with their father in the UK.  Ms Holmes'
    view  is,  given  that  the  Tribunal  were  unable  to  come  to  firm
    conclusions about what the appellant might do as regards the  children,
    that the Tribunal should have considered the possibility that she might
    return to Cameroon on  her  own.   However,  in  oral  submissions  she
    expanded on this and stated that if this amounted to an error of law it
    would not be material because the panel went on to consider  Article  8
    on an alternative basis and their decision is lawful and sustainable.

15.  If Ms Holmes is right and the panel should have  considered  Article  8
    on the basis that the children would remain in the UK and therefore  be
    separated from their mother, whether  or  not  the  failure  to  do  so
    amounts to a material error turns on whether the Tribunal were entitled
    to dismiss the case under Article 8 on the basis that they did  and  if
    so whether or not the balancing exercise  is  flawed  for  the  reasons
    identified in the grounds.

16.  The challenge to the balancing exercise conducted by the panel is  that
    the panel did not properly consider the children's nationality  and  ZH
    (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4 and that there was no consideration of Section
    55 of the  2009  Act.   I  disagree  with  this.   The  panel  properly
    considered the best interests of the children at [37], [39]  and  [41],
    taking into account that the children are British citizens and properly
    attaching significant weight to this. The panel's unequivocal  findings
    that it was in their best interests  to  stay  with  their  mother  and
    return to Cameroon with her (see [41]). (At [42]  the  panel  obviously
    meant to state that nationality is not a  "trump  card"  and  not  best
    interests. The panel was entitled to conclude that nationality was  not
    a decisive factor in this case, given the ages  of  the  children,  and
    that they had not yet started mainstream education. The argument before
    the First-tier Tribunal and before me was based on the  nationality  of
    the children, rather than any other factor that might  be  relevant  to
    their best interests (e.g. separation with their biological father  and
    life in Cameroon with their mother). The panel  was  entitled  to  take
    into  account  the  appellant's  appalling  immigration  history   when
    considering proportionality in the context of Article 8.  Indeed it was
    incumbent on the panel to  attach  little  weight  to  the  appellant's
    private life (or family life) accrued when she has been here unlawfully
    in accordance with section 117 of the 2002 Act.

17.  Should the appellant and her children be separated as a result  of  the
    decision it is likely that this would result in a breach of  Article  8
    of the 1950 Convention  on  Human  Rights.   It  was  accepted  by  the
    Tribunal that she was the primary carer of the two young children.  The
    appellant's case was that her children would be compelled to leave  the
    UK. The Tribunal did not accept this, but found that it is  likely  she
    would take the  children  with  her  and,  in  any  event,  their  best
    interests lay in returning to Cameroon with their mother despite  their
    nationality. There  no  tension  between  the  decision  under  the  EU
    Regulations and the Article 8 decision.

Notice of Decision

18.  There is no arguable error of law in the decision of the panel and  the
    decision to dismiss the appeal under the EEA Regulations and Article  8
    is lawful and sustainable.

19.  I made an anonymity order to protect the identity of  the  children  in
    this case.
