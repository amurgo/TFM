                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


     1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-tier
        Tribunal Judge Butler promulgated on 3 May 2019 in which the  Judge
        dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the  refusal  of  his
        application for leave to remain pursuant to articles 3 and  8  ECHR
        which the appellant claimed engaged an exception to his deportation
        pursuant to UK Borders Act 2007.



Background


     2. The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica born on 25 December 1996. The
        Judge sets out his immigration history at [2] and criminal  history
        at [3].
     3. The Judge notes a number of convictions  set  out  at  [3]  in  the
        following terms:


                    i) On 12 June 2014 possession of a knife for  which  he
                       was given a 3-month referral order, costs of �85 and
                       victim surcharge of �15;
                   ii) On 7 June 2016 possession of cannabis, a  controlled
                       Class B drug for  which  he  was  given  a  12-month
                       conditional  discharge,  costs  of  �85  and  victim
                       surcharge of �15;
                  iii) On 14 September 2016  for  taking  a  motor  vehicle
                       without  consent  and  using   a   vehicle   without
                       insurance for which he  was  fined  �240,  costs  of
                       �300, victim surcharge of �30 and 8  points  on  his
                       licence
                   iv) On 24 January 2017 for possession  of  a  knife  for
                       which he was  sentenced  to  245  days  in  a  Young
                       Offenders Institute and given a victim surcharge  of
                       �415; and
                    v) On 16 February 2018 for possession of  cannabis  and
                       on 6 July 2018 for  possession  of  Class  A  drugs,
                       heroin and cocaine, with intent to supply for  which
                       combined conviction he was sentenced to 5  years  in
                       prison.


     4. The appellant was served a  deportation  order  dated  18  November
        2018.
     5. Having considered the oral and documentary evidence the Judge  sets
        out relevant findings at [27 - 37] of the decision under  challenge
        which are in the following terms:


             27.  The Appellant is 22 years old. He entered the UK when  he
                  was 6 and was without leave for about 8  years  after  the
                  expiry of his visit Visa.  He  has  been  sentenced  to  a
                  period of 4 years imprisonment  and  has,  therefore,  not
                  spent half of his life lawfully resident in the UK.


             28.  He may well argue that  he  is  socially  and  culturally
                  integrated in the UK. He certainly has  a  caring  family,
                  has been educated here and has a loyal circle  of  friends
                  who  have  taken  the  trouble  to  support  his   current
                  application.  However,  the  extent  to   which   he   has
                  integrated is damaged by his criminal activities  and  his
                  convictions. Before me, the Appellant  explained  that  he
                  was blameless in respect of his conviction for  possession
                  with intent to supply Class A drugs. I do not accept  that
                  explanation. In his sentencing remarks, the judge  made  a
                  point of saying the Appellant was near  the  head  of  the
                  activity of obtaining the drugs with intent to supply.  He
                  was not believed even though he pleaded  not  guilty.  His
                  actions were described. It is difficult  to  envisage  how
                  the Appellant can be said to have integrated socially into
                  the UK when his conviction and the length of his  sentence
                  clearly show that his activities were  such  as  to  cause
                  harm to society.


             29.  In assessing whether the Appellant would  face  obstacles
                  to his integration into Jamaica,  I  have  considered  the
                  level of support he would have there  and  the  extent  to
                  which his connections to Jamaica have  survived  since  he
                  entered the UK. Photographs of  a  burned-out  house  have
                  been produced to support the Appellant's account that  his
                  grandmother's  house  was  firebombed  earlier  this  year
                  forcing her to move to the USA to live with her  daughter.
                  There is no evidence that the photographs produced are  of
                  his grandmother's house nor that  the  property  shown  is
                  even in Jamaica. No motive for the  destruction  has  been
                  given. I do  not  accept  Mrs  Drickett's  evidence  that,
                  having been rendered homeless, her mother did not speak to
                  her between the fire and leaving for the USA.


             30.  It has also been suggested that the  Appellant's  younger
                  brother relies on him for support  and  to  take  him  and
                  collect him from school. I was told that  his  mother  had
                  found it necessary to reduce her hours of work in order to
                  cover these duties. This is not, however, supported by the
                  comments in the report of Dr Manyame-Tazarurwa at  page  5
                  where she states, "the mother works long hours as a  carer
                  in order to pay bills and make ends meet".


             31.  The Appellant has also visited Jamaica several times with
                  his mother so cannot be said to  have  completely  severed
                  his ties with his home state. He  would  have  retained  a
                  familiarity with social and cultural matters there.


             32.  Dr Manyame-Tazarurwa's report states throughout that  the
                  Appellant is very sorry for what he has done and does  not
                  intend to  reoffend  out  of  the  love  for  his  family,
                  especially his brother, and the fact he does not  want  to
                  be deported to Jamaica. This does not rest easily with the
                  fact that his offences have escalated in  terms  of  their
                  seriousness. Further, the report was compiled without  the
                  benefit  of  seeing  the  Refusal  Letter  and  sentencing
                  remarks of the judge and is based solely on  an  interview
                  with the Appellant. It is difficult to envisage  that  the
                  Appellant would have said  anything  other  than  what  is
                  recorded. There is no OASys report produced  to  me  which
                  would have given a much better insight into the  prospects
                  or otherwise of the Appellant reoffending. I attach little
                  weight to this report.


             33.  The Appellant also claims to have a problem with his eye.
                  This has been dealt with in detail in the Refusal  Letter.
                  I note, however, that there is no information produced  to
                  me about the condition. The only documentation is  in  the
                  Respondent's bundle at page F and is for an  eye  hospital
                  appointment on 19 August 2013. There is no  indication  of
                  what  the  problem  is,  a  diagnosis  or   a   prognosis.
                  Accordingly, I do not consider it exceptionally enough for
                  a claim under either Article 3 or 8.


             34.  I have considered the evidence produced  in  relation  to
                  the situation in Jamaica, its general lawlessness and,  in
                  particular, the position of those returning there. I  note
                  that the emphasis on those returnees who have been  killed
                  but I also note that the number of such deaths is  only  a
                  small percentage of the total number of deaths each  year.
                  This is borne out by the Home Office  Country  Information
                  on Jamaica. I am also unconvinced by the  suggestion  that
                  the Appellant would be homeless since I find the  evidence
                  of his grandmother's flight to the USA to be unconvincing.


             35.  For the above reasons, I do not find that  the  Appellant
                  falls within the exceptions listed in section 117C. He has
                  not convinced me on the balance of probabilities that  his
                  circumstances are so very compelling as  to  outweigh  the
                  public  interest  in  deporting  him.  In  reaching   this
                  conclusion, I have taken into account of the  decision  in
                  SSHD v Olarewaju [2018] EWCA Civ 557 and applied  this  to
                  my reasoning. On the balance of probabilities, considering
                  the age of the Appellant, his family connections in the UK
                  and Jamaica, the fact that I do  not  accept  he  will  be
                  totally without support and the unconvincing  evidence  of
                  his rehabilitation, I do not consider  there  to  be  very
                  compelling  circumstances  which   outweigh   the   public
                  interest in deportation following what was a very  serious
                  criminal offence.


             36.  Applying these findings to the balancing  of  the  public
                  interest against the Appellant's right to respect for  his
                  Article 8 rights, I consider the five-stage test laid down
                  by Lord Bingham in Razgar. The decision is an interference
                  with the Appellant's right to respect for his private life
                  in the UK which has consequences of  such  gravity  as  to
                  potentially engage Article 8. It is in accordance with the
                  law. It is necessary in a democratic  society  to  protect
                  public order and the protection of others.


             37.  In deciding whether removal is proportionate  in  pursuit
                  of the legitimate end sought to be achieved, I  note  that
                  only  very  compelling  circumstances  will  outweigh  the
                  public interest in removing a  foreign  criminal  who  has
                  committed a Category A offence. From the discussion above,
                  I find no such compelling circumstances in the Appellant's
                  case and it would, therefore, be proportionate  to  remove
                  him.


     6. The appeal was therefore dismissed on all grounds.
     7. The  appellant  sought  permission  to  appeal  arguing  the  Judge
        attached  insufficient  weight  to  the  report  of  Dr  Tazarurwa,
        incorrectly found the psychotherapist report was  prepared  without
        the benefit of the  writer  having  seen  the  decision  letter  or
        sentencing remarks of the judge  when  the  writer  of  the  report
        refers to having had sight of the application to  appeal  of  which
        the decision letter  forms  part.  The  grounds  assert  the  Judge
        misdirected himself infringing the principle that a child must  not
        be blamed for matters for which he or she is not  responsible  such
        as the conduct of the parent which is said to have  arisen  as  the
        appellant is not to be blamed for his prior bad immigration  status
        which occurred when he was a minor and that the  Judge  misdirected
        himself when he found the appellant did not  satisfy  Exception  1.
        The grounds also assert the  Judge  did  not  carry  out  a  proper
        balancing exercise regarding the appellant's integration  into  the
        UK having placed undue weight on his criminal convictions  and  not
        having sufficient regard to the evidence regarding  strong  private
        life established in the UK, that the Judge did not give  sufficient
        if any regard to the best interests of the child such as to  amount
        to arguable legal error.
     8. Permission to appeal was granted by another judge of the First-Tier
        Tribunal the operative part of which reads "in an otherwise careful
        decision it is nevertheless  arguable  that  the  Judge  failed  to
        adequately considered the best interests of the Appellant's younger
        brother for whom the appellant claims to be  a  father  figure  and
        role model."




Error of law


     9. Whether a person has been lawfully resident in the UK for  most  of
        his life, sufficient to engage Exception 1 of  section  117C  is  a
        factual question. In addition Exception 1  requires  more  as  that
        exception only applies where (a)  the  foreign  criminal  has  been
        lawfully resident in the UK for  most  of  his  or  her  life,  the
        foreign criminal is socially and culturally integrated into the UK,
        and there  will  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  the  foreign
        criminals integration into the country to which it is  proposed  he
        or she is to be deported.
    10. The Judge's findings are that the appellant has not  been  lawfully
        resident in the United Kingdom for most of his life.  This  is  not
        punishing the appellant through the actions of his parents but is a
        simple statement of fact which has not been shown to be  incorrect.
        The appellant did not produce sufficient evidence to show that  for
        most of his life he had lawful leave to be in the  United  Kingdom.
        The Judge also found the appellant was not socially and  culturally
        integrated and that there were no very significant obstacles to his
        integration to Jamaica. Accordingly this challenge has no  arguable
        merit.
    11. The assertion by  Mr  Jibowin  that  the  finding  in  relation  to
        integration is flawed has no arguable merit. The  Court  of  Appeal
        have reminded us that integration  includes  a  person  considering
        themselves bound by the laws of the United Kingdom  and  acting  in
        such a manner so as to not  infringe  such  laws.  The  appellant's
        pattern of offending clearly raised sufficient doubt in the Judge's
        mind regarding the level of the appellant's integration. It is  not
        made out the conclusion is outside the range of  findings  open  to
        the Judge on the evidence. It is also not made out that even if the
        appellant was integrated living with his parents,  having  attended
        college, having friends and having been in the United Kingdom since
        6 years of age, it would have made any material difference  to  the
        Judge's decision.
    12. The appellant committed a serious offence regarding the  supply  of
        class A drugs for which there has been judicial authority for  some
        time in relation to the damage the same can cause  to  society  and
        the serious nature of such offending - see for example SS (Nigeria)
        [2013] EWCA Civ 550.
    13. The Judge clearly considered the report of the expert  relied  upon
        by the appellant and gives adequate reasons in support of  findings
        made. The weight to be given to the evidence was a matter  for  the
        Judge and it has not been made out that such weight  is  irrational
        or outside the range permitted to be given to the evidence  by  the
        Judge.
    14. The comment by the Judge at [32] that the report  was  prepared  by
        the psychotherapist without the benefit of the writer  having  seen
        the refusal letter or sentencing remarks is factually correct.  The
        appellant in the grounds claims that such information was contained
        in the original Grounds of Appeal, but such grounds do not set  out
        the full content of either document. The refusal letter is  some  9
        pages and 52 paragraphs long and the  sentencing  remarks  3  pages
        long. The grounds of appeal are considerably shorter, and it is not
        made out the author of the report had the  benefit  of  considering
        these documents in full. The submission by the appellant  that  the
        fact there may be reference to  these  documents  in  the  original
        Grounds of Appeal should somehow allow it to be inferred  that  the
        expert was able to take the content of the  same  into  account  in
        full has no arguable merit. As the Judge noted at [32]  the  report
        in question is based solely on an interview with the appellant. The
        Judge was arguably entitled in  all  the  circumstances  to  attach
        little weight to that report.
    15. The Judge  clearly  considered  the  position  of  the  appellant's
        younger brother who has always been in the care of his  mother  who
        has been responsible for providing such care  especially  when  the
        appellant has been  in  prison.  It  was  not  made  out  the  best
        interests of the child are the determinative factor on the basis of
        the evidence before the Judge. It is not made out the Judge did not
        factor  this  and  other  relevant  considerations   into   account
        cumulatively when assessing the merits of the appeal.
    16. The appellant's denial of responsibility for the offences that  led
        to his conviction by  a  jury  was  noted  by  the  Judge.  In  his
        Sentencing Remarks of 6 June 2018 His Honour Judge Farrell QC,  the
        Record of Cambridge and Peterborough stated:


             Yes stand up please Nicholas Fullerton and  Harvey  Jefferson.
             You Nicholas Fullerton were convicted by a jury unanimously on
             6 June of this year, of 2 counts of  being  concerned  in  the
             supply of class A drugs. You having earlier pleaded guilty  to
             simple possession of cannabis. You, Harvey Jefferson  had  the
             good sense to plead guilty when first before this court to the
             counts that I have to deal with you for: that is counts 5  and
             6, possession with intent to  supply  of  the  class  A  drugs
             cocaine and  diamorphine  respectively.  To  count  7,  simple
             possession of cannabis and count 8, the possession of criminal
             property; namely money relating to the sale of drugs.


             As a result of your early guilty plea, you are entitled to and
             I will give you, the 25% credit reduction that the  guidelines
             indicate is appropriate. I am sure  on  the  evidence  that  I
             heard at the trial and in relation to you, Mr Fullerton,  that
             you were at the higher end of this chain of supply enterprise.
             You held the phone, you organised the  deals  and  facilitated
             the delivery of drugs. You in my  judgement,  plainly  had  an
             operational or management function within the chain.  You,  Mr
             Jefferson, held the drugs. You therefore, had the higher  risk
             end of the operation, but you went to the house of what was  a
             vulnerable user - despite that user not in fact, being in fear
             of you - in order to use the premises to assist in the  supply
             of the class A drugs.


             As I hope both of you are now aware, the  supply  of  class  A
             drugs is regarded by the courts as extremely serious,  because
             it is the distribution of the cause of misery  to  those  that
             are addicted to drugs.  It  affects  their  health;  it  often
             causes them to commit acquisitive crime in order to fund their
             habit that they have. And you, the pair of you, were  involved
             in this operation, undoubtedly for money, making money out  of
             the misery that those that are addicted to drugs  suffer.  And
             indirectly, obviously to the public in general  because  those
             who are addicted commit, as I have said,  acquisitive  crimes;
             burglaries, robberies and the  like  in  order  to  fund  that
             addiction.


             That is why the courts take class A drugs so seriously. And it
             is further aggravated in this particular case,  because  there
             is no doubt at all that this is what has been described  as  a
             country lines case. One in which  inevitably,  younger  people
             come up from London in order to distribute drugs  in  counties
             outside London, and that is what you were  doing.  So  far  as
             your previous convictions are concerned, you Mr Fullerton have
             two previous convictions for  possession  of  knives,  one  of
             which cause you to go into custody and  also  possession  -  a
             possession of drugs.  You,  Mr  Jefferson,  have  no  relevant
             previous convictions, you are both 21 years of age.


    17. The Judge thereafter undertook the sentencing exercise resulting in
        the appellant being sentenced as noted above.
    18. In Hesham Ali (Iraq) v SSHD [2016] UKSC 60  Lord  Reed  noted  that
        "cases falling within the scope of section 32 of the  2007  Act  in
        which the public interest in deportation is outweighed, other  than
        those specified in the new rules themselves, are  likely  to  be  a
        very small minority (particularly in non-settled cases). They  need
        not necessarily involve any circumstance which  is  exceptional  in
        the sense of being extraordinary (as counsel for the  Secretary  of
        State accepted, consistently with Huang [2007] 2 AC 167, para  20),
        but they can be said to involve "exceptional circumstances" in  the
        sense that they involve a departure from the general rule".
    19. Whilst the appellant disagrees with  the  Judge's  conclusions  and
        does not wish to be deported from the United  Kingdom  it  has  not
        been made out the Judge's findings are outside the range  of  those
        reasonably available to the Judge on the evidence. It is  not  made
        out there is anything in the  grounds  sufficient  to  warrant  the
        Upper Tribunal interfering any  further  in  what  is  a  carefully
        considered and written decision balancing the  competing  interests
        in this deportation appeal.
    20. In relation to the appellant's role model argument,  whatever  role
        the appellant played in assisting his mother with his brother he is
        not the primary carer and the evidence before the Judge  failed  to
        establish that his brothers best interests were adversely  affected
        by his deportation.
    21. There were no  Article  8  considerations  remotely  sufficient  to
        displace Parliament's judgment of the weight to  be  given  to  the
        deportation of the appellant as a foreign criminal pursuant to  the
        automatic deportation provisions in this case.  Article  3  is  not
        engaged. The grounds amount to no more than disagreement  with  the
        Judge's  carefully  considered  conclusion  that   deportation   is
        proportionate.

Decision

    22. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
        decision. The determination shall stand.

   Anonymity.


    23. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


I make no  such  order  pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
