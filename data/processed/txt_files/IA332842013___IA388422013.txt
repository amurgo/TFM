For the Respondent:     Mr A McVeety,  Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellants are citizens  of  Nigeria,  born  respectively  on  20th
    November 1985 and 6th November 1979.  On 29th June 2013 both Appellants
    had made a combined application for  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom as Tier 1  (Entrepreneurs)  Migrants  under  the  Points  Based
    System (PBS) and for  a  Bio  Metric  Residence  Permit  (BRP).   Those
    applications were refused by  the  Secretary  of  State  in  Notice  of
    Refusals dated 16th July 2013. The grounds upon which they were refused
    are set out in detail within  that  Notice  of  Refusal  to  show  that
    according to the Secretary of State, the Appellants were  not  able  to
    meet the terms of Appendix A:  Attributes  and  consequently  were  not
    awarded the appropriate points that  were  required  for  the  sections
    entitled

    . Applicant has access to funds as required.

    . Funds held in regulated financial institution(s)

    . Funds disposable in the United Kingdom

2.   The Appellants appealed and requested that the appeal be dealt with  on
    the papers and the appeal came before Judge of the First Tier  Tribunal
    Fox sitting at North Shields on 16th January 2014.  In a  determination
    promulgated on  20th  January  2014,  the  appeal  was  dismissed.  The
    Appellants lodged grounds of appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  20th
    January 2014 and on 12th February 2014, First Tier Tribunal Judge Levin
    granted permission to appeal.   Judge  Levin  noted  that  the  grounds
    argued that the Judge had erred in law in finding that  the  Appellants
    had failed to demonstrate that they had sufficient funds to be  awarded
    points under Appendix A as the balance in the Appellant's NatWest  Bank
    Account was overdrawn on 16th May 2013.   As this pre dated the date of
    the application and the bank statement showed that the bank account was
    in credit in the sum of in excess of ï¿½15,000 on  2nd  July  2013  until
    15th November 2013, then arguably there was an  error  of  law  in  the
    Judge deciding the issue on the  basis  of  the  Appellant's  financial
    position at a date prior to the application.

3.   It is on that basis that the appeal comes  before  me.  The  Appellants
    are represented by their instructed legal representative Mr  Chimpango.
    The Secretary of State is represented by  her  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer Mr McVeety.

Submissions/Discussions

4.   Mr McVeety points out that he acknowledges that there is  an  error  in
    the decision of the First Tier Tribunal Judge in that the Judge got his
    analysis wrong, but not for the  reasons  given.   He  points  out  two
    issues.  First of all as a preliminary point he advises that the Second
    Appellant Mr Bello, does  not  have  a  right  of  appeal,  because  he
    currently has outstanding leave.  Further, he points out that  this  is
    an appeal of a Points Based System application  and  that  pursuant  to
    para 85A(3) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002.   The
    Judge only considered evidence that was before the decision  maker  and
    therefore he was wrong to consider further evidence and points out that
    this has been referred to in the Rule 24 Response dated  26th  February
    2014.

5.   He submits that the Judge failed to consider the issues in the  refusal
    properly, but to some extent acknowledges that the Judge  was  hampered
    by the limited information that was before him as he heard  the  appeal
    on the papers.

6.   Mr Chimpango  relies  on  the  grounds  of  appeal  and  contends  that
    documents were  provided  with  the  application  and  that  it  should
    therefore be considered under Section 85A(4) of the 2002 Act, and  that
    it was appropriate for the Judge to give due consideration to them.  He
    asked me to allow the appeal.
The Law

7.   Errors of legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  following  binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account   immaterial   consideration,
    reaching irrational conclusions on  fact  or  evaluation  give  legally
    inadequate  reasons  for  the  decision  and   procedural   unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

8.   It is not an arguable error of law for an  Immigration  Judge  to  give
    too little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality
    is alleged. Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to  fail
    to deal with every factual issue of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story told is untrue.  If a  point
    of evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is
    a failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings

9.   The arguments  of  the  Secretary  of  State  are  persuasive.   It  is
    generally acknowledged  that  the  Rules  relating  to  application  by
    entrepreneur  migrants  prescribe  very   strictly   the   format   and
    documentation that has to be provided.  Further, as Mr  McVeety  points
    out, the Appellants are not  going  to  be  subjected  to  any  removal
    directions if their appeal fails, but what is required by the Secretary
    of State is that the applications are properly completed and  that  all
    requirements of  the  Rules  are  adequately  met.   In  this  case,  I
    understand from the Appellant that they wish  to  set  up  a  financial
    advisory service and there is no reason that I can see why they  should
    not do so, providing they meet the requirement of the Rule and can show
    that they are entitled to a visa as entrepreneurial migrants.  However,
    in order to do that, I agree with the submission  made  by  Mr  McVeety
    that it is imperative that the strict requirements  of  the  Rules  are
    met.

10.  The decision of the First Tier Tribunal does  contain  material  errors
    of law.  The Judge considered the evidence that was before him  without
    being aware as to when it was submitted, and whilst  I  acknowledge  Mr
    Chimpango's contention that the evidence was submitted at the  time  of
    the application, that is most strongly refuted by Mr McVeety on  behalf
    of the Secretary of State and the burden of proof is on  the  Appellant
    to show that it was.  However, the Judge has erred that in finding that
    in May 2013 the account was overdrawn for a short period of time,  that
    that in itself under  the  Rules  was  good  reason  for  refusing  the
    application.  I thus set aside the decision of the First Tier Tribunal.



11.  I  am,  between  dictation  and  promulgation  of  this  determination,
    advised that leave is sought to withdraw the appeal.  I am prepared  to
    consent to that approach.

12.   However,  if  I  remade  the  decision  I  would  have  dismissed  the
    Appellant's appeal.  The reasons are twofold.  Firstly, so far  as  the
    Second Appellant, he clearly does not have a right of appeal. That  has
    not been picked up by a First Tier Tribunal  Judge  but  he  cannot  be
    criticised for that because it was not an issue that was raised  before
    him.  The Second Appellant's extant leave had not expired and therefore
    under the Rules he was not in  a  position  to  make  his  application.
    Secondly, so far as the First Appellant is concerned, she is not  in  a
    position to satisfy the attributes section  because  the  documentation
    must be provided at the date of application not at the date of  appeal.
    That again is prescribed within the Rules.  In such  circumstances  the
    appeal would have been dismissed.

Decision

13.  The appeals are accepted as withdrawn and the Tribunal makes  an  Order
    to that effect.

14.  No Anonymity Order was made by  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  Judge.   No
    application is made to vary that order and none is made.
