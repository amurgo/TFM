                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is the Appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Sweet who in a decision promulgated on  15  August  2017
    dismissed his appeal against a decision of the Respondent  refusing  to
    issue a permanent residence card to the Appellant as an extended family
    member under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

 2. I do not need to set out  the  background  to  this  case  because  the
    parties agree that the decision of Judge Sweet  cannot  stand  for  the
    reasons given below.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal  concluded  that  it  had  no  jurisdiction  to
    entertain the appeal following the case of Sala (EFMs: Right of Appeal)
    [2016] UKUT 00411.

 4. In the light of Khan v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2017] EWCA Civ 1755, the First-tier  Tribunal  was  wrong  in  law  to
    conclude that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

 5. I therefore set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, pursuant
    to section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act  2007.
    I remit the case to the First-tier  Tribunal  at  Taylor  House  for  a
    hearing of the Appellant's appeal on a date to be notified.

Decision

The Appellant's appeal against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
allowed. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at  Taylor  House
to be heard on the next available date by a judge other than Judge Sweet.


Signed      Date: 16 February 2018
