Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr I Khan, instructed by Hamlet Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms A Weller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Mashahed Hussain, date of birth 25.10.80, is  a  citizen
    of Bangladesh.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Finch promulgated 9.3.15, dismissing his appeal against the decision of
    the Secretary of State, dated 4.6.14, to refuse leave to remain in  the
    UK as a spouse, and on 10.6.14 to remove him from the  UK.   The  Judge
    heard the appeal on 11.2.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Macdonald granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    11.5.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 28.8.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein, I find that there was no material error
    of law in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  so  as
    to require the decision of Judge Finch to be set aside.

 6. In essence, the grounds of application for permission and as  amplified
    in Mr Khan's submissions to me, challenge the judge's  conclusion  that
    deception was used in his 2011 ETS test, on the basis that there was  a
    lack of specific evidence relating to this  appellant.  It  is  further
    complained on this issue that at �12 the judge misdirected  herself  by
    comparing the scores on two different tests.

 7. In relation to the comparison between the two tests at �12, I find that
    the judge was fully entitled to take the rather stark discrepancy  into
    account. Mr Khan was unable to demonstrate why  the  comparison  was  a
    misdirection and could not assist me with what the  difference  between
    the two tests is. The first test from 2011 was for the purpose of a PBS
    student application, and involves a  higher  threshold  requirement  at
    level 8 in speaking and  level  7  in  writing  in  the  assessment  of
    competence in English. The appellant scored an impressive  200  points,
    which Judge Finch pointed out was a perfect score. However,  two  years
    later on the lower level 1 test for the  purpose  of  Appendix  FM,  he
    scored only 16 from 21 in speaking and listening. As Ms Weller  pointed
    out from objective information about the first test, it required highly
    intelligible use of English with complex use  of  grammar  and  precise
    speech. It is hardly likely that the appellant's  standard  of  English
    would have declined after two further years of living in the UK. In the
    circumstances, I  find  no  error  in  the  judge's  reliance  on  this
    evidence, which is very  specific  to  the  appellant  to  confirm  the
    finding made earlier in the decision that on the available evidence the
    appellant had used deception in his 2011 application.

 8. Mr Khan points out that the Home Office was unable to provide  specific
    evidence naming this appellant in any list of names, but  the  evidence
    on which the refusal is based is entirely objective  and  it  is  clear
    that this appellant's score was identified, amongst others, by  ETS  as
    having been obtained by deception. It further follows that ETS reviewed
    his score and invalidated his  test  result,  because  on  14.12.11  an
    anomaly with his speaking test indicated the presence of a  proxy  test
    taker. How this is arrived at is set out clearly in the evidence of  Mr
    Millington and  Ms  Collins  and  it  is  clear  that  it  involves  an
    individual check once an anomaly in the result had been identified. The
    standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities  and,  taking  the
    evidence as a whole, I find it was entirely open to the judge to  reach
    the  conclusion  that  the  appellant  had  used   deception   in   his
    application. In essence, the grounds on this issue are no more  than  a
    disagreement with the findings of the judge.

 9. It follows that the appellant cannot meet the requirements of  Appendix
    FM and his application failed at the suitability requirement stage.

10. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Macdonald observed  that  there
    was little merit in the grounds of application for permission to appeal
    in relation to the insurmountable  obstacles  test,  finding  that  the
    judge had given clear reasons for her findings.

11. As the application failed at the suitability requirement, the appellant
    could not meet the requirements of EX1 in any  event.  Neither  had  he
    complied with the specified evidence requirements of Appendix FM-SE. To
    that extent, consideration of EX1  was  theoretical  only,  though  the
    prism of the Rules for leave to remain as a  partner  would  be  highly
    relevant to any consideration of family life outside the Rules  on  the
    basis of article 8 ECHR.

12. However,  applying  EX2  definition  of  insurmountable  obstacles,  as
    meaning very significant difficulties in continuing family life outside
    the UK which could  not  be  overcome  or  would  entail  very  serious
    hardship for the application or partner, to the facts as summarised  at
    �14 of the decision,  the  judge  concluded  that  the  evidence  "goes
    nowhere near" meeting the test. There can  be  no  doubt  that  such  a
    conclusion was entirely open to the judge on the facts of the case.

13. Mr Khan relies on the British nationality of  the  appellant's  spouse,
    but all of the matters raised were taken into  account  by  the  judge.
    Further, in Agyarko v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 440,  the  Court  of  Appeal
    pointed out that the mere fact that the spouse is a British citizen and
    had lived all his life in the UK with employment, and hence might  find
    it difficult and might be reluctant  to  relocate  outside  the  UK  to
    continue family life, could not constitute insurmountable obstacles  to
    his doing so.

14. The appellant's spouse is not required to leave the UK, that is  matter
    for her to decide. However, it is relevant to note that  in  every  EX1
    case the spouse or partner is necessarily either a British  citizen  or
    settled in the UK and yet the applicant has to demonstrate  that  there
    are insurmountable obstacles to continuing family life outside the  UK.
    I find that the judge has given careful consideration to  all  relevant
    factors and reached a conclusion fully open on  the  evidence  and  for
    which cogent reasons were provided in the decision.

15. Further, where an appellant's status is precarious, as in  the  present
    case, and there are no children involved, in order to  succeed  outside
    the Rules on the basis of article 8 ECHR, the appellant would have  had
    to  demonstrate  exceptional  circumstances.  In  SS   (Congo),   after
    reviewing the authorities, the Court of Appeal stated,  "It  is  clear,
    therefore, that it cannot be maintained as a general  proposition  that
    LTR or LTE outside the Immigration Rules  should  only  be  granted  in
    exceptional cases. However, in  certain  specific  contexts,  a  proper
    application of Article 8 may itself make it clear that the  legal  test
    for grant of LTR or LTE outside the Rules should indeed be  a  test  of
    exceptionality. This has now been identified to be  the  case,  on  the
    basis of the constant jurisprudence of the ECtHR itself, in relation to
    applications for LTR outside the Rules on  the  basis  of  family  life
    (where no children are involved) established in the United Kingdom at a
    time when the presence of one or other of the partners was known to  be
    precarious: see Nagre, paras. [38]-[43], approved by this court  in  MF
    (Nigeria) at [41]-[42]."

16. The claimant is not even in as  strong  a  position  as  that  outlined
    above. It follows that there is no merit in this ground of appeal.

Conclusion & Decision

17. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an  order  pursuant  to  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
Tribunal (Procedure) Rules.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.
