For the respondent:    Ms A Brocklesby-Weller, Senior Home Office
Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Wyman promulgated 10.9.15, dismissed his appeal  against
    the decision of the Secretary of State, dated 16.1.15,  to  refuse  his
    application for further leave to remain in the UK  and  to  remove  him
    from the UK pursuant to  section  47  of  the  Immigration  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006. The Judge heard the appeal on 19.8.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth granted permission to appeal  on
    27.1.16.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 23.3.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the decision of Judge Wyman should be set aside.

 5. I have carefully considered all of the materials present  in  the  case
    file and put before me at the error of law hearing, together  with  the
    able and helpful submissions of both  Mr  Solomon  and  Ms  Brocklesby-
    Weller.

 6. The relevant background can  be  summarised  briefly  as  follows.  The
    appellant claims to have entered the UK  unlawfully  in  2001  and  has
    remained ever since. In 2010 his application for leave to remain on the
    basis  of  private  and  family  life  was  rejected.  A  further  such
    application was made and refused in 2011. The refusal was  reconsidered
    but still refused. The appellant  then  appealed  that  refusal,  which
    Immigration Judge Flynn allowed in October 2011, on the  basis  of  his
    family life in the UK with a partner and her child. In consequence,  he
    was granted discretionary leave for  a  period  of  3  years,  expiring
    3.11.14.

 7. Shortly before expiry of that discretionary leave, the  appellant  made
    the application the refusal of which is the  subject  of  this  appeal,
    seeking further leave to remain. It is  relevant  to  note  that  Judge
    Wyman found  as  a  fact,  that  the  appellant  was  no  longer  in  a
    relationship with a partner, has no child in the UK, and  thus  has  no
    family life in the UK.

 8. I have considered the reasons for refusal  in  more  detail  hereafter.
    However, in summary, the application was refused on the general grounds
    under 322(5) and under paragraph 276ADE, both  relying  on  a  criminal
    conviction for passport offences  and  the  failure  to  disclose  that
    conviction in his application for further leave. The Secretary of State
    also concluded that there were no very  significant  obstacles  to  his
    integration in Algeria, and further  that  there  were  no  exceptional
    circumstances to justify granting leave outside the Rules.

 9.  Judge  Wyman  found  that  there  had  been  a  material   change   in
    circumstances since the discretionary leave had been granted  following
    Judge Flynn's decision allowing the appellant's appeal in  2011.  Judge
    Wyman went on to find that the appellant did not meet the  requirements
    of paragraph 276ADE in respect of his private life and considering  the
    matter outside the Rules, that the decision was not disproportionate to
    his article 8 ECHR rights to respect for private life. The  judge  also
    did not accept that the appellant is at risk on return under article  3
    because of a pending prison sentence in Algeria. Thus  the  appeal  was
    dismissed on both immigration and human rights grounds.

10. In granting permission to appeal,  Judge  Hollingworth  considered  the
    following to be arguable:

      a) That the judge was not sufficiently precise in making findings on S-
         LTR 1 in relation to the appellant's record, given the reference at
         �61 of the decision to Mr Solomon's submission that the Home Office
         Guidance for general grounds of refusal states that it is  unlikely
         that a person will be  refused  under  the  character,  conduct  or
         association grounds for a single conviction that results in a  non-
         custodial sentence outside the relevant timeframe;

      b) That the judge has not evaluated the relevant factors and  attached
         the appropriate weight to each;

      c) It is arguable that the judge has not provided sufficient  analysis
         leading to the conclusion that there was a  deliberate  attempt  to
         deceive the Secretary of State with respect to convictions;

      d) It is arguable that the judge approached the question  of  risk  on
         return on an incorrect footing,  given  the  previous  findings  by
         another judge in the circumstances referred to in the decision, and
         that too much weight was attached to the absence of a further claim
         for asylum.

11. The Rule 24 response of the Secretary of State, dated 16.2.16,  submits
    that the grant of permission was overly generous to the appellant,  and
    that the decision discloses no material errors of law.  It  is  further
    submitted that there is no arguable error of law  in  relation  to  the
    issue  of  the  conviction,  as  the  general  ground  of  refusal  and
    application of S-LTR were concerned not just with  the  conviction  but
    the appellant's failure to disclose it. Finally, it is  submitted  that
    the judge properly addressed  the  risk  on  return,  noting  that  the
    appellant chose not to make an asylum claim and there would  not  be  a
    breach of article 3 on his return.

12. The grounds of appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  argued  that  the
    refusal decision was not in accordance with the law and  in  particular
    with the Home Office  policy  on  considering  applications  to  extend
    previously granted discretionary leave. The grounds contain an  extract
    from the policy suggesting that "if there have been significant changes
    or  the  applicant  fails  to  meet  the  criminality  thresholds  (see
    criminality and exclusion section above), the application  for  further
    leave should be refused." The grounds asserted that there had  been  no
    significant change in the circumstances prevailing at the time  of  the
    grant of discretionary leave and that the criminality threshold did not
    apply since suspended sentences are treated as non-custodial.

13. However, Judge Wyman found that there had been  a  material  change  in
    circumstances, in that the appellant was no longer  in  a  relationship
    with a partner or her child and had no family life in the UK. The judge
    gave detailed consideration to the reasons why the  appellant's  appeal
    was allowed on human rights grounds pursuant to article 8 ECHR back  in
    2011, setting out a summary of Judge Flynn's decision between  �44  and
    �50. It is clear that the appeal was allowed on  the  basis  of  family
    life with a partner and her child.

14. The judge found that the appellant was dishonest in his  oral  evidence
    at the appeal hearing in August 2015, claiming that he had only  broken
    up with his partner  two  months  earlier  and  expected  to  reconcile
    shortly. The judge pointed out that he made no reference to his partner
    and her child when he made his application in October 2014.  The  judge
    thus concluded he has no family life in the UK.

15. I find that Judge Wyman was entitled to conclude that the appellant has
    no family life in the UK, for the reasons very  clearly  given  in  the
    decision and which were open to the judge on  the  evidence.  Thus  the
    judge  was  entitled  to  conclude  there  was  a  material  change  in
    circumstances since the decision  of  Judge  Flynn  and  the  grant  of
    discretionary leave. It is clear that the judge addressed the ground of
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal relating to Home  Office  policy.  It
    follows that the refusal decision of the  Secretary  of  State  was  in
    accordance with the law, even  though  the  refusal  decision  did  not
    directly address  the  policy  in  relation  to  further  extension  of
    discretionary leave and there is no material  error  of  law  in  Judge
    Wyman's refusal to accede to this ground of appeal.

16. The first reason for the refusal decision relates to  paragraph  322(5)
    of the Immigration Rules. In February 2013 the appellant was  convicted
    of offences of possession of a false identity  document,  and  given  a
    suspended sentence of imprisonment. This related to his use of a  false
    French passport to gain entry to the UK in 2001. In the light  of  this
    conviction,  the  Secretary  of  State  considered  that  it  would  be
    undesirable to permit him to remain in the UK and his  application  was
    refused under the discretionary general grounds of paragraph 322(5)  of
    the Immigration Rules, grounds  on  which  leave  "should  normally  be
    refused,"  namely,  "the  undesirability  of  permitting   the   person
    concerned to remain in the UK in the light of  his  conduct  (including
    convictions which do not fall within paragraph  322(1C),  character  or
    associations or the fact  that  he  represents  a  threat  to  national
    security."

17. The grounds submit that the First-tier Tribunal Judge failed to reach a
    clear finding in relation to the refusal under paragraph 322(5). At �61
    of the decision Judge Wyman took into account Mr Solomon's reference to
    the Home Office guidance, suggesting that it is unlikely that a  person
    will be refused on the general grounds for  a  single  conviction  that
    results in a non-custodial sentence. However, as the judge pointed out,
    it wasn't just the conviction but also the  failure  to  disclose  that
    conviction either in the application form or the 7-page letter  of  his
    legal representatives accompanying the application. This is  also  part
    of his 'conduct.' The judge rejected the argument that this failure was
    accidental.  The  judge  concluded  that  the  appellant   deliberately
    attempted to deceive the Secretary of State by failing to disclose  his
    2013 conviction, pointing out that the box in the form  signed  by  the
    appellant was ticked no to the question relating to convictions and  no
    reference was made in the detailed letter submitted in support  by  his
    legal representatives.

18. Although the judge doesn't specifically address paragraph 322(5), it is
    clear from a reading of the decision as a whole that on  the  basis  of
    the findings, including those set out at �61, the criteria for  refusal
    under 322(5) is made out.

19. Even if the judge was in error  in  respect  of  paragraph  322(5),  it
    follows that in the light of the  other  findings  and  conclusions  in
    relation to private life, the appeal would still  have  been  dismissed
    and thus any such error cannot be material.

20. The second ground of appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  related  to
    private life under paragraph 276ADE and the refusal in reliance on both
    S-LTR and very significant obstacles.

21. 276ADE has a preliminary hurdle of a suitability requirement,  imported
    from Appendix FM: "The appellant must not fall for refusal under any of
    the grounds in Section S-LTR 1.2 to S-LTR 2.3 and S-LTR 3.1 in Appendix
    FM."

22. S-LTR 1.1, which is not imported into 276ADE, provides that  S-LTR  1.2
    to S-LTR 1.7 are mandatory grounds  for  refusal.  However,  S-LTR  2.1
    provides that "the applicant will normally be  refused  on  grounds  of
    suitability if any of paragraphs S-LTR 2.2. to 2.4 apply." It is  clear
    from the wording of  paragraph  276ADE  that  if  this  hurdle  is  not
    overcome, an applicant cannot rely on any of the subsequent provisions,
    including the 'very significant obstacles to integration' test.

23. The Secretary of State considered  that  pursuant  to  S-LTR  1.6,  the
    presence of the appellant is not conducive to the public  good  because
    his conduct (including convictions which do not fall within  paragraphs
    S-LTR 1.3 to 1.5), character, associations, or other reasons,  make  it
    undesirable to allow him to remain in the UK. Reliance  was  placed  on
    his criminal convictions.

24. The Secretary of State also relied on S-LTR 2.2,  which  provides  that
    whether  or  not  to  the  applicant's  knowledge,  false  information,
    representation or documents have been  submitted  in  relation  to  the
    application (including false information submitted  to  any  person  to
    obtain a document used in support of the  application);  or  there  has
    been  a  failure  to  disclose  material  facts  in  relation  to   the
    application. Relying on S-LTR 2.2, the Secretary of State points to the
    fact that the appellant failed to disclose  his  criminal  convictions,
    which were material facts in relation to his application.

25. Although the First-tier Tribunal Judge found the appellant to  have  no
    family life in the UK (but family life with his 3 children in Algeria),
    it was accepted that he has a private life in the UK.  That  he  speaks
    English and has set up his  own  business  are  amongst  other  matters
    referred to in the decision. However, the judge went on  to  find  that
    the appellant did not meet the requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE,  as
    there would not be very significant obstacles  to  his  integration  in
    Algeria.

26. I agree that the judge has not been entirely clear when addressing  the
    S-LTR suitability requirements, but it is referenced  at  �23  and  the
    judge took account of the evidence of and submissions on behalf of  the
    appellant as to  his  criminality  and  the  failure  to  disclose  the
    conviction, which it was submitted was a mistake  and  not  deliberate.
    There are clear and cogent reasons  for  the  judge's  reject  of  that
    submission and her conclusion that the appellant deliberately sought to
    deceive.

27. In fact, according to S-LTR 2.2 it matters not  whether  the  appellant
    knew that false information, representation, etc. was submitted,  or  a
    failure to disclose material facts. His knowledge might be relevant  as
    to whether to exercise the discretionary refusal under S-LTR  2.2,  but
    as the judge found he did have  knowledge  and  attempted  to  deceive,
    there is no merit in this ground of appeal. Applying  the  findings  to
    the test there is no foundational basis for arguing that on those facts
    the discretion should  not  have  been  exercised.  Thus  there  is  no
    material error of law in this regard.

28. Further, there is no discretion in S-LTR 1.6. It is the decision of the
    Secretary of State that his presence is not  conducive  to  the  public
    good and it cannot be  said,  taking  account  of  the  facts  and  the
    findings of the First-tier Tribunal Judge, that  such  a  decision  was
    unreasonable or irrational, or otherwise perverse. It was entirely open
    to the Secretary of State to rely on S-LTR 1.6, particularly given  the
    serious nature of the criminal offence, relating as it did to  identity
    documents.

29. It follows that irrespective of any  'no  ties'  or  'very  significant
    obstacles' test, the appellant could not meet the requirements  of  the
    Rules for leave to remain.

30. The conclusion that there is no material error of law in  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal also follows from the fact  that  the  judge
    nevertheless went on to consider the very significant obstacles test in
    paragraph 276ADE, finding that  there  are  no  such  very  significant
    obstacles, for the reasons stated.

31. Even if the appellant could have overcome the suitability requirements,
    the Secretary of State points out that the appellant has  not  been  in
    the UK for a period of 20 years and does not accept that there are very
    significant obstacles to his integration into Algeria,  where,  on  his
    own account, he spent the first 35 years of his life before  coming  to
    the UK. The application relied on an assertion of no ties. In fact, the
    relevant test is not the former "no ties (including social, cultural or
    family)" under 276ADE(1)(vi), but since 28.7.14, "there would  be  very
    significant obstacles to the applicant's integration into  the  country
    to which he would have to go if required  to  leave  the  UK."  In  any
    event, the judge also rejected the claim that the  appellant  had  lost
    all ties to Algeria,  given  that  he  admitted  remaining  in  regular
    contact with his parents and also his three children.

32. I reject Mr Solomon's argument that Judge Wyman should have  considered
    the issue of significant obstacles settled by  the  decision  of  Judge
    Flynn in 2011, in which that judge accepted that the appellant had been
    sentenced to one year in prison plus a payment of a fine for abandoning
    his family. I accept that Judge Flynn stated at �52  of  that  decision
    that, "I consider it very likely that he will  be  sent  to  prison  in
    accordance with the court decision and that this will give  rise  to  a
    real risk of inhuman treatment."  I  also  accept  that  Judge  Wyman's
    suggestion that the appellant will be able to pay the  fine  and  avoid
    the prison sentence is no more than speculation.  However,  the  appeal
    before Judge Flynn was not allowed on  the  basis  of  article  3,  but
    article 8 ECHR. This appellant was advised in the refusal decision that
    if he wished to rely on article 3, he would have to make that claim  in
    person as an asylum claim. He has declined to do so. Thus the Secretary
    of State has not addressed it in the refusal decision.

33. In any  event,  the  judge  considered  the  submissions  and  evidence
    submitted by Mr Solomon as to prison conditions and  concluded  at  �66
    that whilst they  were  overcrowded  and  did  not  meet  international
    standards, the evidence did not demonstrate a likely breach of  article
    3 ECHR, pointing out that prosecution does not amount  to  persecution.
    The judge's conclusions were entirely open  on  the  evidence.  In  the
    circumstances, there is no merit in this ground of appeal.

34. In relation to private life the Judge went on  to  consider  article  8
    ECHR outside the Rules, applying the stepped Razgar assessment. In  the
    light of SS (Congo) it is not clear that there are on the facts of this
    case any compelling  circumstances  insufficiently  recognised  in  the
    Rules to justify considering the appellant's private life  outside  the
    Immigration Rules. In the  refusal  decision  the  Secretary  of  State
    considered that there are no exceptional  circumstances  to  warrant  a
    grant of leave to remain outside the Rules on the basis of  private  or
    family life under article 8 ECHR.

35. Whilst each case has to be considered on its own merits, on  the  facts
    as found by the First-tier Tribunal Judge it is  far  from  clear  that
    article 8 private life is engaged at all. In Nasim and others  (article
    8) [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal considered  whether  the
    hypothetical removal of the 22 PBS claimants, pursuant to the  decision
    to refuse to vary leave,  would  violate  the  UK's  obligations  under
    article 8 ECHR, observing that the judgements of the Supreme  Court  in
    Patel and Others v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72, "served to  re-focus  attention
    on the nature and purpose of article 8 of the ECHR and, in  particular,
    to recognise that article's limited utility in private life cases  that
    are far removed from  the  protection  of  an  individual's  moral  and
    physical integrity."

36. However, the judge did make a reasoned article 8  ECHR  assessment  and
    concluded  that  the  appellant's  removal  from  the   UK   would   be
    proportionate to the legitimate and necessary  aim  of  protecting  the
    economic well-being of the  UK  though  immigration  control,  for  the
    cogent reasons set out in the decision.

37. Mr Solomon drew my attention to UE (Nigeria) &  others  v  SSHD  [2010]
    EWCA Civ 975, to suggest that the First-tier Tribunal Judge should have
    considered the contribution of the appellant  to  society,  relying  on
    evidence including a news report that he had offered training to  local
    youths in his business, and that the loss of such public benefit was  a
    matter  that  should  have   been   brought   into   account   in   the
    proportionality balancing exercise. However, at �36  of  that  decision
    Sir David Keene explained that he would expect such a consideration  to
    make a difference to  the  outcome  of  immigration  cases  only  in  a
    relatively few  instances  where  the  positive  contribution  to  this
    country is very significant... The main element in the public  interest
    will normally consist  of  the  need  to  maintain  a  firm  policy  of
    immigration control, and little will go to undermine that. It  will  be
    unusual for the loss of benefit to the community to tip the  scales  in
    an appellant's favour..." Frankly, in the light of his  conviction  and
    the  material  change  of  circumstances  there  is  nothing   in   the
    appellant's story and background that could or  would  reasonably  have
    been sufficient to outweigh the considerable  public  interest  in  his
    removal.

38. I should mention  at  this  stage  that  the  judge  should  have  also
    considered the public interest considerations under section 117B of the
    2002 Act, taking into account in that proportionality  assessment  that
    immigration control is in the public interest and  that  little  weight
    should  be  given  to  a  private  life  developed  whilst  a  person's
    immigration status is precarious, as is the case for this appellant. In
    the circumstances, it is difficult to envisage how the appellant  could
    have succeeded in a private life claim on the facts of this case.

39. In all the circumstances, it is clear there is no merit in any  of  the
    grounds of appeal. Whilst the judge could and should have  specifically
    and directly addressed the reasons  for  refusal  and  the  grounds  of
    appeal, in the event there was no material error of law as the ultimate
    dismissal of the appeal at the First-tier Tribunal  was  inevitable  on
    the facts found by the judge.

Conclusions:

40. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.
