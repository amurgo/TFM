                     DECISION ON REQUEST FOR WITHDRAWAL

 1. By way of a letter to the Upper Tribunal dated 18  September  2014  the
    appellant's representatives requested  withdrawal  of  the  appellant's
    appeal before the Upper Tribunal as the appellant proposes  to  make  a
    new application.

 2. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as a whole I
    give consent to the appellant to withdraw his case.

 3. Accordingly with my consent, and pursuant to rule 17(5) of the Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008,  this  appeal  is  recorded  as
    "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal". This  is  a  Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform the parties that the appellant's  case
    is withdrawn.

 4. The effect of the appellant's  case  being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal  are  at  an
    end. There is no appeal before the Upper Tribunal  and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision shall stand.
