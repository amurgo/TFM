                            DECISION AND REASONS


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms. C Philps, Counsel, instructed  by  Owens  Stevens
Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr. T Melvin, Senior Presenting Officer


Introduction

1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of the First-tier
   Tribunal Herlihy ('the Judge') sent to the parties on 9 March 2020 by
   which the appellant's appeal against the decision to refuse him leave to
   remain in this country on human rights (article 8) grounds was dismissed.
   The respondent seeks to deport the appellant to Jamaica.

2. Upper Tribunal Judge Allen granted permission to appeal on all grounds
   by means of a decision dated 11 June 2020.

Remote hearing

3. The hearing before me was a Skype for Business video conference hearing
   during the Covid-19 pandemic. I was present in a hearing room at Field
   House. The hearing room and the building were open to the public. The
   hearing and its start time were listed in the cause list. I was addressed
   by the representatives in the same way as if we were together in the
   hearing room. I am satisfied: that this constituted a hearing in open
   court; that the open justice principle has been secured; that no party
   has been prejudiced; and that, insofar as there has been any restriction
   on a right or interest, it is justified as necessary and proportionate.

Anonymity

4. The Judge issued an anonymity direction, and no request was made by
   either party for such direction to be set aside.

5. I observe that no reasons were given by the Judge for the making of the
   anonymity direction. Reasons are required when making such judicial
   direction.

6. I am mindful of Guidance Note 2013 No 1 concerned with the issuing of an
   anonymity direction and I observe that the starting point for
   consideration of such a direction in this Chamber of the Upper Tribunal,
   as in all courts and tribunals, is open justice. The principle of open
   justice is fundamental to the common law. The rationale for this is to
   protect the rights of the parties and also to maintain public confidence
   in the administration of justice. Revelation of the identity of the
   parties is an important part of open justice: Re: Guardian News & Media
   Ltd [2010] UKSC 1; [2010] 2 AC 697.

7. The appellant's circumstances are not, alone, such as to justify the
   overriding of article 10 rights. He has committed serious criminal
   offences which are a matter of public record.

8. Paragraph 18 of the Guidance Note confirms that the identity of children
   whether they are appellants or the children of an appellant (or otherwise
   concerned with the proceedings), will not normally be disclosed nor will
   their school, the names of their teacher or any social worker or health
   professional with whom they are concerned, unless there are good reasons
   in the interests of justice to do so. I note that the step of not naming
   a wife or children and the attendant step of there being no reference
   made to where the family reside, the ages of the children or what school
   they attend, is often a suitable alternative to the making of an
   anonymity direction.

9. However, I observe that the appellant relies upon the neuro-
   developmental difficulties affecting one of his children. The publication
   of such personal difficulties may be very distressing to the young
   person, a minor, if full details of his condition are made known to his
   peers. In such circumstances, I am satisfied that this is a matter where
   the demands of open justice do not outweigh the article 8 rights of this
   young person. In order to protect the identity of the young person, it is
   appropriate to anonymise the names of the appellant and other close
   family members. I therefore confirm the anonymity direction issued by the
   Judge, which is detailed at the conclusion of this decision.

Background

10. The appellant is a national of Jamaica and is presently aged 36. He
   arrived in the United Kingdom in May 2002, seeking leave to enter as a
   visitor. This application was refused, but he was issued with temporary
   admission. He failed to attend the airport to return home as directed. He
   was subsequently treated as an absconder.

11. His first son, 'AA', was born in 2004 and is presently aged 16. He is a
   British citizen.

12. The appellant applied for leave to remain outside of the Immigration
   Rules ('the Rules') in October 2004. The respondent refused the
   application in August 2005 and a subsequent appeal (IJ Buckwell) was
   dismissed on 31 October 2005.

13. He was detained in 2006 and on 20 January 2007 he was removed to
   Jamaica.

14. In April 2009 the appellant applied for entry clearance to join his
   partner 'NN' in the United Kingdom. NN is the mother of AA. The
   application was successful, and he entered the United Kingdom in July
   2009, enjoying leave to enter until 30 September 2011.

15. The appellant made an in-time application for leave to remain as the
   spouse of NN on 30 September 2011.

Criminal offence - 2011

16. In 2011 police officers undertook a number of test purchases of illegal
   drugs from a property. Consequent to such test purchases six men,
   including the appellant, were prosecuted for the supply of, or possession
   with intent to supply, crack cocaine and cannabis. A Crown Court Judge
   considered the defendants to be part of an organised criminal enterprise.



17. The appellant pleaded guilty to three counts of supplying a Class A
   drug (crack cocaine) and was sentenced to three years' imprisonment,
   concurrent on each count.

18. In sentencing the appellant, the sentencing judge gave credit for his
   guilty plea and noted that his role was to respond to the test purchase
   officer via an intermediary, 'in other words, the test purchase officers
   contacted a third party who in turn turned to you and you then made
   available the supply'. The sentencing judge concluded that the
   appellant's role was not to the same extent as that held by his co-
   defendants.

Decision to deport - 2013

19. The respondent decided to the deport the appellant and a deportation
   order was signed on 30 January 2013. The appellant appealed against this
   decision and he was successful on appeal before the First-tier Tribunal
   (JFtT Moore and Mr. Ravenscroft) by a decision sent to the parties on 14
   August 2013. The Tribunal was satisfied that the appellant genuinely
   regretted his association with a bad crowd and as to having been involved
   in criminal activity. The Tribunal considered the offence to be out-of-
   character and noted his family life with NN and AA.

20. The respondent revoked the deportation order and granted the appellant
   leave to remain until 27 May 2016.

Family life

21. Three further children were born to the appellant in 2014, 2015 and
   2016. The mother of the elder two children is SS, a British citizen. The
   mother of the youngest child is CC, also a British citizen. All three
   children are British.

22. The appellant has never lived with SS and CC. At the time of the births
   between 2014 and 2016, the appellant resided with NN.

23. The appellant applied for leave to remain under the 10-year rule in May
   2016.

Criminal offence - 2017

24. In March 2017, the appellant was found guilty by a jury in respect of:

         i)   one count of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm
            contrary to section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act
            1861 ('the 1861 Act')


        ii)   one count of possessing an offensive weapon in a public place,
            contrary to section 1 of the Prevention of Crime Act 1953

25. The jury was discharged from giving a verdict on an alternative count
   of unlawfully and maliciously wounding or inflicting grievous bodily
   harm, contrary to section 20 of the 1861 Act.

26. In sentencing the appellant to six years' imprisonment, the Crown Court
   Judge remarked, inter alia:

          'You get no credit, as you've denied any guilt in its entirety.
         It's a little hard to believe that you fought this case, because
         you were shown the film of the incident when you were being
         questioned by the police in the police station. I can only believe
         that you were hoping that the complainant [Mr. X] would not come to
         court and give evidence against you, and that the case might
         collapse in that way.


         I have no doubt that but for his using the bike to defend himself,
         you would have stabbed him more seriously or with more serious
         consequences. And also I have no doubt that you got some associates
         of yours to come back with you to hit him again. What you had
         against him, I have absolutely no idea. But again, I have no doubt
         that you demonstrated your hostility to him on a previous occasion.


         ...


         Knife carrying is rightly and increasingly condemned and regarded
         as very serious by the courts, and often calls for deterrent
         sentences. And the reason for that is that a knife can cause fatal
         injuries, depending on which part of the body it goes into. And
         very often, where the knife goes and what the knife does and what
         the consequences are for the victim is a matter of pure chance. I'm
         not going to repeat what was read out by way of the victim impact
         statement, but it does show how serious the consequences were for
         [Mr. X] as a result of this injury, quite apart from the disruption
         of his relationship with his child.'

27. The sentencing judge imposed an order upon the appellant restraining
   him from approaching or contacting Mr. X for an indefinite period.

Decision to deport - 2018

28. By a decision dated 29 May 2018 the respondent decided to deport the
   appellant, having refused human rights representations. A deportation
   order was signed the same day.

29. Though they separated prior to the appellant's conviction in 2017, NN
   and the appellant have reunited.

Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

30. The appeal came before the Judge sitting at Taylor House on 29 January
   2020. The appellant gave evidence as did NN, SS and two social workers,
   Ms. Johnson and Ms. Wilson.

31. By means of a detailed, carefully considered decision running to 64
   paragraphs the Judge observed that, for the purpose of statute and the
   Rules, the appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of over four
   years. She further observed the judgment of the Supreme Court in Hesham
   Ali v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] UKSC 60, [2016]
   1 W.L.R. 4799.

32. The Judge decided, inter alia:

          . The appellant enjoys a genuine and subsisting relationship with
            all four of his children: [45] of the decision


          . The best interests of the children are served by remaining in
            this country in the care of their mothers, who are their
            principal carers: [45]


          . The appellant's strongest parental relationship subsists with
            AA: [46]


          . AA's physical and emotional problems cannot entirely be
            attributed to the appellant's imprisonment: [47]


          . However, it is very likely that the appellant's imprisonment
            contributed to the deterioration of AA's mental and physical
            health: [47]


          . The appellant's relationships with his other children have been
            fractured by his imprisonment and by his never having lived with
            them in the family home: [50]


          . It is not credible that the appellant would struggle to find
            employment upon return to Jamaica: [55].

33. The Judge concluded, inter alia:

         '61. Although I find that the appellant's deportation will be
            detrimental to his children, and particularly his eldest son
            [AA] and [another child], and will be hard for [SS] who is
            struggling to bring up her family as a single parent, I cannot
            find that the consequences of separation of the appellant from
            his children and family gives rise to very compelling reasons
            over and above those in paragraphs 399 and 399A ... I fully
            accept that there is a risk that the appellant's deportation
            could have adverse effects upon his two sons and that
            opportunities to meet outside the United Kingdom might be very
            limited due to a lack of financial resources. The impact of
            separation on the appellant's children has to some extent been
            diminished by the appellant's absence from his children due to
            his two periods of imprisonment and the reduced role in the
            lives of his younger sons. I find that the separation of the
            appellant from his children does not indicate the serious degree
            of emotional harm that was found to exist in the case of JG.
            Notwithstanding the detrimental impact of the appellant's
            deportation on his children I do not find that the effects are
            very compelling so as to outweigh the very strong public
            interest in the appellant's deportation.'

Grounds of Appeal

34. Grounds of appeal were authored by Ms. Francis, Counsel, who appeared
   before the First-tier Tribunal on behalf of the appellant, and can be
   summarised as follows:

         1) An application for an adjournment to secure further evidence
            concerning AA was refused by the Judge but is not recorded in
            the Judge's decision.


         2) Having refused the adjournment request on the basis that AA's
            mental health was not material to her decision, the Judge
            considered the child's health at [46] of her decision


         3) The Judge erred in concluding that AA's circumstances are less
            severe than those present in Secretary of State for the Home
            Department v. JG (Jamaica) [2019] EWCA Civ 982.


         4) The Judge erred by failing to conduct an individualised
            assessment of the appellant's children as required.

35. In granting permission to appeal, UTJ Allen reasoned:

          'On balance it is arguable that there is merit to the procedural
         error issue set out in the grounds. All the grounds may be argued,
         though the above appears to be the essential point.'

36. The respondent filed a rule 24 response authored by Mr. Tufan, dated 9
   September 2020. Accompanying the response was a copy of a file note
   authored by Ms. Darkwah, a Presenting Officer, who represented the
   respondent before the First-tier Tribunal.

37. A response to directions, dated 3 December 2020, also authored Mr.
   Tufan, was filed with the Tribunal.

38. The appellant's legal representatives made an application under rule
   15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, dated 1
   September 2020, for the Tribunal to consider evidence that was not before
   the First-tier Tribunal. Unfortunately, a casual approach was adopted to
   the application, with a failure to abide by rule 15(2A)(a)(ii) which
   requires an explanation as to why such evidence was not submitted to the
   First-tier Tribunal.

39. A further concern as to the approach adopted by the legal
   representatives is exemplified by Ms. Philps candid confirmation that the
   evidence provided did not detail the subsequent decision of the Child and
   Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) not to proceed with its
   proposed intervention. She could only assert, being unable to present
   corroborative evidence on the point, that CAMHS had taken such step
   because an intervention was proposed by another organisation, First
   Steps.

40. Despite the failings in the rule 15(2A) application, Mr. Melvin took no
   point on behalf of the respondent, no doubt understanding the importance
   of the Tribunal having sight of Ms. Francis' witness statement dated 29
   August 2020, her contemporaneous note of proceedings and the medical
   evidence she had sought to secure by means of her adjournment
   application.

Decision on Error of Law

41. For the reasons given below I have decided that the decision of the
   Judge should be set aside on procedural fairness grounds, the Judge
   having been under a duty to act fairly. However, for the benefit of the
   parties I observe that my consideration was finely balanced and
   ultimately it was one particular factor that led to my considering that I
   am required to set aside the decision on this ground of challenge.

42. I have had the opportunity to consider the very detailed record of
   proceedings compiled by the Judge. I am satisfied that in most respects
   she took a very careful note of proceedings. However, the record is
   silent as to the adjournment request.

43. I have been provided with a note from Ms. Darkwah. It is a short
   document running to just under two pages, which is not a criticism of Ms.
   Darkwah as it appears to be a file note authored after the hearing. There
   is no mention of the adjournment request.

44. Ms. Francis confirms by her witness statement that an accompanying
   typed attendance note was prepared at the hearing and the only subsequent
   alterations were to amend typographical errors and to remove privileged
   instructions. Such amendments were appropriate in the circumstances.

45. Counsel's typed note of the hearing confirms that NN was asked a number
   of questions in examination-in-chief before detailed cross-examination
   was undertaken. The Judge then asked several questions by means of
   clarification including questions concerned with AA's medical treatment.
   Ms. Francis then undertook reasonably lengthy re-examination, during the
   course of which an adjournment request was made. The relevant passages of
   the typed note are:

         '187. J - in answer to the question - evidence does not exist -
             assessment ongoing - got the witnesses [Sic] evidence, which is
             evidence - do not see it as an issue - cannot produce evidence
             - not psych or psychologist.


         188. RF - [submissions made in support of an adjournment: [NN]
             referring to evidence in her possession and soon to be in her
             possession, should be given an opportunity to provide that
             evidence - will have a bearing on J determination - key to
             question of [child's] health and impact]


         189. J - can draw inferences - more likely than not is it - looking
             at timing of evidence - this has had an impact on son's health
             - evidence not necessary - no adjournment.'

46. Mr. Melvin accepted the reliability of counsel's typed note.

47. I find that the failure to record in the decision and reasons authored
   by the Judge both the adjournment application and the subsequent decision
   made in respect of it constitutes an error of law. However, such error
   need not be material, particularly in circumstances where oral reasons
   were given at the hearing, and so I proceed to consider both the oral
   reasons and the subsequent approach adopted by the Judge in her decision.

48. I am satisfied that the oral reasons given by the Judge, as recorded by
   Ms. Francis, were reasonable in the circumstances. The evidence Ms.
   Francis sought to secure by means of the adjournment concerned proposed
   interventions identified by Dr Charlesworth and Dr Sinclair, clinical
   psychologists at First Steps. Such evidence consists of Dr Charlesworth's
   letter, dated 2 October 2019, and Dr Sinclair's letter dated 24 October
   2019. They both predate the hearing before the Judge on 29 January 2020.
   By her oral reasoning the judge accepted that she could draw inferences
   from NN's evidence that there had been a medical impact on AA's mental
   health and so it was not necessary to secure evidence to that effect.
   Such reasons were reasonable in the circumstances.

49. The difficulty that arises in this matter flows from a subsequent
   finding of fact made by the Judge at [46] her decision:

         '46.  ... I did not find there was any evidence that [AA] was
            receiving any mental health treatment or that there was
            objective evidence of the diagnosis of emotional stress disorder
            but I see no reason to doubt the claim that he was receiving
            counselling at school.'

50. I observe the reference by Dr Charlesworth in her letter of 2 October
   2019 that a proposed intervention was for AA to attend an 'Understanding
   and Managing Emotions Workshop' to help him understand his feelings and
   to learn about practical strategies that help young people cope with
   difficult emotions. I further note Dr Sinclair's reference to AA having
   been referred to First Steps to help put in place strategies to
   understand and manage emotions in circumstances where he was using food
   to regulate them.

51. I observe that the application to adjourn was not expressly refused on
   the ground that further delay would prejudice the respondent. Rather, it
   was refused following confirmation that there was no requirement to
   adjourn to permit the securing of further evidence because a positive
   inference would be drawn from the evidence of NN on the issue of her
   son's treatment. In such circumstances I am satisfied that there was
   procedural unfairness by the Judge refusing the adjournment on a stated
   basis and then proceeding to make a contrary finding of fact that AA was
   not receiving mental health treatment. Whilst the evidence presented to
   this Tribunal may possibly be insufficient to establish that AA had
   received mental health treatment; it is of sufficient substance to permit
   an appropriate submission before a fact-finding judge that it is capable
   of so establishing. Consequently, I find that there is a material
   irregularity arising from the failure to record the adjournment request
   and the attendant decision, coupled with the subsequent unfair approach
   adopted towards whether AA had received mental health treatment. Such
   unfairness requires the decision to be set aside.

52. In the circumstances I am not required to consider the remaining
   grounds.

Remaking the Decision

53. Both parties indicated that if procedural unfairness were established,
   and findings of fact were required to be remade in their entirety, this
   was a matter that should properly be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.



54. I have given careful consideration to the Joint Practice Statement of
   the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal concerning the disposal of
   appeals in this Tribunal, in particular paragraph 7.2, and conclude that
   the effect of the material error of law has been to deprive the appellant
   of a fair hearing before the First-tier Tribunal. Consequently, I set
   aside the decision and remit it back to the First-tier Tribunal at Taylor
   House.

Postscript

55. I observe that the index offence was captured by CCTV footage, which
   was seen by both a jury and a Crown Court Judge. The latter was clear in
   his sentencing remarks as to the events established by such footage.

56. I further note that the CPS papers were subsequently considered by the
   appellant's probation officer.

57. By means of their report, dated 12 August 2019, Ms. Johnson and Ms.
   Wilson detail the limited documentary information provided to them. They
   confirm at �3.0 that they had sight of previous representations authored
   on behalf of the appellant dated 26 May 2016, a number of medical
   appointment letters and school reports concerned with AA.

58. They detail the appellant's assertions as to events leading up to the
   stabbing of Mr. X, as presented at a prison visit, including:

         '59. ... [The appellant] said that he had never spoken to [Mr. X]
            and so did not know anything about him ...


         ...


         61. On the day of the incident, [the appellant] said that he was in
            the market buying fruits, when [Mr. X] rode up to him on his
            bike. [Mr. X] asked [the appellant] if he knew how long that he
            had been looking for him to kill him and that was what triggered
            the whole incident.'

59. I observe that the jury rejected the appellant's account of self-
   defence, finding that the prosecution had established its case to the
   criminal standard, namely beyond reasonable doubt.

60. I note that within the appellant's bundle served upon the First-tier
   Tribunal is a copy of the appellant's OASys (Offender Assessment System)
   assessment prepared by his offender manager on 4 July 2019, some 6 months
   before the First-tier Tribunal hearing. I further note that OASys
   assessments are undertaken by probation officers trained in conducting
   them.

61. At page 3 of the assessment [page 74 of the appellant's bundle], there
   is confirmation of the papers available to the assessor at the time of
   the assessment, which include the CPS papers.

62. The details of the offence are detailed in the 'analysis of offences'
   section at page 7 of the assessment [page 78 of bundle]:

         '[The appellant] appeared at [Crown Court] on [date in March 2017]
         where he was sentenced to a 72 month custodial sentence for
         wounding.


         The brief offence details are as follows:


         [In April 2016 the appellant] was seen on CCTV to have bumped into
         the victim [Mr. X], both of whom were on bikes. [The appellant] is
         then seen to jump off his bike and start attacking [Mr. X] in which
         is noted to be an over arm stabbing motion. [Mr. X] is seen to hold
         his bike up to protect himself from the assault. [The appellant] is
         then seen to cycle off and return moments later with 4 other males
         in tow, one of whom is seen to punch [Mr. X] before he manages to
         escape.'

63. Despite what was identified by the sentencing judge as clear CCTV
   evidence as to the crime, the appellant informed the assessor in the
   OASys interview that he acted in self-defence, at [page 8 of report, page
   79 of bundle]:

         'On discussion with [the appellant] he stated that the version of
         events in the CPS documents were false and that [Mr. X] said to him
         that he was actually there to kill him. At this, [the appellant]
         reports to have acted in self-defence, hit him twice and ran off.
         He went on to say that he had cycled off and bumped into old
         friends who he told what had happened. It is reported that these
         friends have then sought [Mr. X] and that [the appellant] had
         chased them after them to stop them from doing anything further.


         If [the appellant's] version of events are [sic] to be believed
         then the motivating factor in this offence was self-preservation.
         However, his account and that of [Mr. X] and the CPS documents
         differ greatly. After reading the CPS documents, I am struggling to
         see any motivation behind the attack and cannot see any catalyst.
         It is my assessment that there must have been a personal issues
         [sic] between [the appellant] and the victim, which has escalated
         to the offence.'

64. The assessment further details the appellant's assertion in interview
   that he was never in possession of a knife and did not stab Mr. X [page 9
   of report, page 80 of bundle]. The assessor further details, at [page 22
   of report, page 93 of bundle]:

         '[The appellant denies the offence and stated that he was acting in
         self-defence. He added that he punched him twice and ran off,
         adding that he never had a knife on him. [The appellant] added that
         he thinks the victim started the confrontation to get some
         compensation. If [the appellant's] story is to be believed then is
         [sic] shows some issues around problem solving and impulsive
         behaviour, in that he felt threatened so attacked, rather than
         trying to remove himself from the situation.


         However, [the appellant's] story does not add up with the injuries
         the victim received, including a gash on his arm. It is my
         assessment that this offence shows a lack of impulse control as
         well as temper control ...'

65. The Judge notes the following as to the social workers' oral evidence
   before her at the hearing in January 2020:

         '35. In cross-examination the witnesses confirmed they had seen the
            decision letter of the respondent and the Judge's sentencing
            remarks and PNC records. It was put to them that the appellant's
            criminality escalated since the first offence. They both
            expressed the view that when they had initially seen the papers
            they asked why anyone would want the appellant around their
            children but when they visited the appellant and looked at his
            antecedents and the extenuating circumstances around the offence
            (which were referred to in the report) and met his mother, they
            found her story to be consistent with what was going on with his
            sister and discovered that the appellant was a gentle character
            around his children ...'

66. I observe that the social workers identify at �126 of their report that
   the appellant is truly remorseful, though this sits ill-at-ease with his
   stated position as to the circumstances of the wounding offence.

67. I further observe that the assessor was informed by the appellant in
   interview that he had met Mr. X on two occasions prior to the offence
   [page 7 of report, page 78 of bundle]. On its face, such evidence is
   inconsistent with his later informing the social workers that he had
   never spoken to Mr. X.

68. It may be said that the social workers exhibit a lack of critical
   analysis in respect of the information provided to them, and there is no
   outward concern raised as to the appellant's veracity.

69. Whilst their professional opinion may ultimately be found by a Judge to
   be appropriate, the appellant should properly expect the social workers
   to be required to address their approach to the information provided to
   them, and their uncritical assessment of it.

70. I further observe the conclusion of the social workers' report:

         'We ask in light of the above that you exercise discretion and
         grant [the appellant] one last chance to prove that he can be law-
         abiding and remain in the this [sic] country for the sake and
         wellbeing of his blended family and rekindle the life they had here
         prior to his loss of liberty.'

71. It is not appropriate that independent social workers adopt the role of
   advocates on behalf of an appellant.

Notice of Decision

72. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
   of law on a point of law and I set aside the Judge's decision promulgated
   on 9 March 2020 pursuant to section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts and
   Enforcement Act 2007.

73. This matter is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Taylor House for
   a fresh hearing, before any Judge other than Judge Herlihy. No findings
   of fact are preserved.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

74. Unless the Upper Tribunal or a court directs otherwise no report of
   these proceedings or any form of publication thereof shall directly or
   indirectly identify the appellant and members of his family. This
   direction applies to, amongst others, the appellant and the respondent.
   Any failure to comply with this direction could give rise to contempt of
   court proceedings.
