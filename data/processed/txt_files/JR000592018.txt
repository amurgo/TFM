Representation:

For the Appellant: David Chirico, Counsel instructed by Duncan Lewis & Co
For the  Respondent:  Mr  Christopher  Staker,  Counsel  instructed  by  the
Government Legal Department

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The applicant (a  Nigerian  national)  seeks  judicial  review  of  the
    decision of the Secretary of State that she can safely be  returned  to
    France under the Dublin Ill Regulation. The applicant had made a  claim
    that her removal to France would breach her human rights, in particular
    article 3 of the European Convention  on  Human  Rights  ("ECHR").  The
    Secretary of State refused the  claim  and  certified  it  as  "clearly
    unfounded" under Schedule 3, Part 2, paragraph 5(4) of the  Asylum  and
    Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004.

 2. In her claim form, the applicant describes the decision under challenge
    as "refusal and certification of human rights claim". By  the  time  of
    the oral hearing before me, the  challenge  had  essentially  become  a
    challenge to certification. The primary ground of  challenge  was  that
    the  applicant  would  suffer  destitution  in   France   pending   the
    determination of her asylum claim there. Mr David Chirico submitted  on
    her behalf that her living  conditions  would  amount  to  inhuman  and
    degrading treatment and that she could not safely  be  removed  without
    specific assurances from  the  French  authorities  as  to  her  future
    treatment. He submitted in addition that her removal  to  France  would
    bring about the risk of her refoulment to Nigeria.  He  criticised  the
    Secretary of State's  treatment  of  a  medical  report,  submitted  in
    support of the human rights claim, as applying an unduly high  standard
    of proof.

    The facts

 3. The applicant claims to have arrived in France in June (possibly  July)
    2014 via Libya and Italy. It seems that she made a first  asylum  claim
    in France based on regional inter-religious clashes  in  Nigeria.  That
    claim was rejected on 30 November 2015. At some stage,  she  asked  for
    reconsideration of the claim, seeking in effect to make a second asylum
    claim. That second claim was declared inadmissible on  7  October  2017
    because it did not contain any new element.

 4. The applicant did not exercise her right of appeal against the  refusal
    of either her first or second claims.  In  a  witness  statement  which
    lacks detail, she says that she lived in Lyon with a  French  man  whom
    she met by chance. She claims that neither the French  authorities  nor
    the legal sector nor any  of  the  French  migrant  organisations  were
    willing to assist her with her asylum claim. When the man with whom she
    was living told her to leave, she went  to  Paris,  dividing  her  time
    between the streets and a church which helped migrants. She  says  that
    this period was extremely difficult for her but does  not  mention  any
    specific physical or mental health problems. After  her  second  asylum
    claim was refused, she  feared  deportation  and  came  to  the  United
    Kingdom.

 5. The applicant claims to have arrived in the United Kingdom  on  19  May
    2017. She presented herself at a London police station on 20  May  2017
    and was thereafter detained and treated as an illegal entrant.

 6. On 22 May 2017, she applied for asylum on the basis of a fear  of  Boko
    Haram who (she said) have in the past kidnapped her. On 19  July  2017,
    the Secretary of  State  sent  a  formal  request  to  France  to  take
    responsibility for consideration of the applicant's asylum claim  under
    the terms of the Dublin Ill Regulation. On 25  July  2017,  the  French
    authorities accepted that they were the authorities responsible for the
    asylum claim. On 16 August 2017, the Secretary  of  State  refused  the
    asylum claim and certified it on safe third country grounds.

 7. On 7 December 2017, the  applicant  was  notified  that  she  would  be
    removed to  France.  By  letter  of  the  same  date,  the  applicant's
    solicitors made representations to the Secretary  of  State  contending
    that the decision to certify the asylum claim was unlawful on a  number
    of grounds, including human rights  grounds.  The  Secretary  of  State
    treated the representations as a human rights claim and, on 14 December
    2017, rejected the claim and certified it as clearly unfounded.

 8. On 5 January 2018, the applicant's  solicitors  sent  a  letter  before
    claim. The present application for judicial  review  was  filed  on  10
    January 2018. The Secretary of State responded  to  the  letter  before
    claim on 16 January 2018.

 9. After these proceedings had been launched, the  applicant's  solicitors
    made further representations to the Secretary of  State  and  submitted
    new evidence, namely reports  about  French  asylum  procedures  and  a
    medical report  by  a  doctor  at  the  Helen  Bamber  Foundation.  The
    Secretary of State responded by way of a fresh  letter  dated  9  March
    2018. That letter has been treated by both parties as a fresh decision.
    It formed the focus of amended grounds for judicial review. On  3  July
    2018, Upper Tribunal Judge Gleeson granted the applicant permission  to
    amend her grounds and permission to apply for judicial review.

10. The grounds for judicial review contain a challenge to the use  of  the
    Limited Notice of Removal procedure. By the  time  of  the  applicant's
    amended grounds, it was no  longer  a  live  issue;  but  the  claimant
    persisted with the challenge until it was conceded to be academic in Mr
    Chirico's skeleton argument. I did not hear submissions  on  the  issue
    and need say no more about it.

    The applicant's evidence

11.  By the time of the hearing  before  me,  the  applicant  had  submitted
    three principal sources of evidence (other than her witness  statement)
    in support of her case that her human rights claim could not reasonably
    be regarded as clearly unfounded. First, in relation to conditions  for
    asylum seekers, she relied on the AIDA Country Report on  France,  2017
    Update ("the AIDA Update").  This  report  (produced  by  the  European
    Council on Refugees and Exiles) is  a  compilation  of  information  on
    asylum practices in France. The Secretary of State does  not  challenge
    the evidence within the AIDA Update but does challenge the way in which
    the applicant deploys it in service of an  article  3  claim.  I  shall
    return to this report below in more detail.

12. The applicant relies also  on  evidence  of  reception  conditions  for
    asylum seekers contained in a report (dated 5  November  2017)  and  an
    Addendum report (dated 9 February 2018) by Dr Anic�e  M.  Van  Engeland
    who is senior lecturer in security and law at Cranfield University  and
    visiting lecturer in French law at the University of Westminster. I  do
    not understand her expert credentials and qualifications, as opposed to
    her conclusions, to be challenged.

13. Thirdly, the applicant  relies  on  a  medical  report  by  Dr  Phyliss
    Turvill, a retired GP and a former Approved Medical Practitioner  under
    the Mental Health Act 1983 who  now  writes  medico-legal  reports.  Dr
    Turvill examined the applicant on 19 and 26 October 2017. She  recorded
    that the applicant has numerous scars, each  of  which  she  classified
    under the descriptions  set  out  in  paragraph  187  of  the  Istanbul
    Protocol Manual on the Effective  Investigation  and  Documentation  of
    Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment  or  Punishment
    (United Nations, 2004).

14.  These  Istanbul  Protocol  descriptions  relate  to  the   degree   of
    consistency between the lesion under examination  and  the  attribution
    for the lesion given by a patient who claims to have  suffered  torture
    or trauma. The descriptions range from "not consistent"  (meaning  that
    the lesion could not have been caused by the trauma  described  by  the
    patient) to "diagnostic of" (meaning that the appearance of the  lesion
    could not have been caused in any way other than that described by  the
    patient). In a careful and well-reasoned report, Dr  Turvill  concluded
    that the applicant's numerous scars are (respectively) to  be  regarded
    as "highly consistent"[pic] "typical" and "consistent" with her account
    of past trauma. None of the scars fall into  the  outer  categories  of
    "not consistent" or "diagnostic"[pic]

15. Dr Turvill carried out a psychological examination which concluded that
    the applicant was suffering from Mild Depression treatable by  her  GP.
    The prognosis is improved by the applicant's  "remarkable  resilience".
    Dr Turvill's expertise (in the sense of  her  qualifications  to  reach
    conclusions on scarring and depression) has not been not challenged.

16. I have assumed that, if returned to France, the  applicant  would  make
    another claim for asylum. I make this assumption  both  because  it  is
    customary in such cases to take the facts at their  reasonable  highest
    (R (EM (Eritrea)) v SSHD [2014] UKSC 12, [2014] AC 132,  para  12)  and
    also because the Secretary of State did  not  suggest  that  any  other
    course of action was likely or plausible.

    The Secretary of State's decision

17. The essence of the decision to send the applicant to France is that she
    has not displaced the significant evidential presumption that  European
    Member States will comply with human rights obligations  under  EU  law
    and under the ECHR. The author of the refusal letter cites Lord Kerr in
    EM (Eritrea), para 67, as laying down the principle that, in  order  to
    rebut the presumption, a  claimant  will  have  to  produce  sufficient
    evidence to show that it would be unsafe for the court to rely  on  the
    presumption.

18. In concluding that the  presumption  has  not  been  displaced  in  the
    present  case,  the  letter  observes  that  neither  UNHCR   nor   any
    internationally recognised NGO takes the view that there are systematic
    or serious operational difficulties in French law or asylum procedures.
    The European Court of Human Rights ("ECtHR") has considered the  safety
    of France and has not concluded that there is any  general  prohibition
    against Dublin returns.

19. Recognising that systemic or general difficulties form only  one  route
    by which a claimant may displace the presumption, the letter  considers
    Dr Van Engeland's Addendum report. The Secretary of State regards  that
    report as flawed because the domestic courts have not found that France
    is unsafe for Dublin returnees. The refusal letter concludes  that  the
    report is speculative and expressed in only general terms. It  warrants
    no more than limited weight.

20. The refusal  letter  goes  on  to  consider  Dr  Turvill's  report  and
    concludes that she would need to have concluded  that  an  overwhelming
    number of scars were diagnostic on the Istanbul  Protocol  descriptions
    before the report was worthy of weight. As Dr Turvill's conclusions  do
    not rule out the possibility that the scars  were  caused  by  everyday
    injury, her report fails to support the  applicant's  account  of  past
    events. The medical report should therefore be accorded  no  more  than
    limited weight.

    The legal framework

    Certification

21. The Secretary of State did not only reject the human rights  claim  but
    also  certified  the  claim  as  clearly  unfounded.  The   effect   of
    certification is to remove the right - under sections 82 and  92(3)  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  -  to  bring  an  in-
    country appeal on human rights grounds against the decision  to  remove
    the applicant to France. Paragraph 5(4) of Schedule 3 to the  2004  Act
    obliges the Secretary of State to certify  unless  satisfied  that  the
    claim is "not clearly unfounded".  A  certificate  that  the  claim  is
    clearly unfounded can be only issued if "on any  legitimate  view"  the
    applicant's claim  that  her  removal  to  France  would  constitute  a
    violation of her human rights would be bound to fail on appeal (see  EM
    (Eritrea), para 6 citing previous case law to this effect).

    Relevant EU provisions

22. No point of dispute arises in relation to the interpretation of  Dublin
    Ill, which is the shorthand name for EU Regulation No  604/2013  of  26
    June 2013 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining  the
    Member State responsible for examining an  application  for  protection
    lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national.  Dublin
    Ill recasts  the  former,  so-called  Dublin  Regulation.  It  was  not
    suggested that the extensive case law on Dublin issues is no longer  to
    be followed.

23. I was also taken to relevant parts of the recast  Procedures  Directive
    and the recast  Reception  Directive.  The  latter  lays  down  minimum
    standards for the reception of applicants for international protection.
    Article 2(g)  defines  "material  reception  conditions"  as  including
    housing, food and clothing, and a  daily  expenses  allowance.  Article
    17(2) enjoins Member States to ensure that:

             "material reception conditions provide an adequate standard of
             living for applicants, which guarantees their subsistence  and
             protects their physical and mental health"[pic]

24. Article 20(1)(c) of the Reception Directive permits  Member  States  to
    reduce or in exceptional cases withdraw material  reception  conditions
    where an applicant has lodged a subsequent application  for  protection
    meaning (under Article 2(q) of  the  Procedures  Directive)  a  further
    application for international protection made after  a  final  decision
    has been taken on a previous application.

25. Article 21 of the Reception Directive  stipulates  that  Member  States
    shall take into account the specific situation of vulnerable persons in
    the national law implementing the Directive. Article  21  includes  the
    victims of physical violence  in  the  categories  of  person  who  are
    vulnerable and who, by reason of vulnerability, have special  reception
    needs. Within a reasonable time after an application for  international
    protection is made, Member States must make an assessment of whether an
    applicant is vulnerable (Article 22 of the Reception Directive).

26. The categories of vulnerable person identified in Article 21 should  be
    a starting point for the Tribunal's assessment of vulnerability but  do
    not impede an individualised assessment based on the  circumstances  of
    each case (SM, para 324). Some people may have inherent characteristics
    that render them vulnerable, such  as  unaccompanied  children  or  the
    elderly (R (SM & Ors) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2018] UKUT 429 (IAC) ("SM"), para 325); but both the  nature  and  the
    extent of a person's vulnerability are relevant  to  whether  obstacles
    and conditions in a third country might reach the article  3  threshold
    (SM, para 323). There are no  bright  lines  and  it  is  difficult  to
    specify in definite terms when a particular vulnerability might  engage
    the United Kingdom's human rights obligations (SM, para 325).

    Article 3 ECHR

27. There is a significant evidential presumption that France  will  comply
    with its international obligations including provisions of EU  law  and
    the ECHR in relation to asylum procedures and reception conditions (see
    EM (Eritrea), paras 4041 and 64). The "critical test" where  article  3
    is raised remains the long-established test in Soering v United Kingdom
    11 EHRR 439, namely whether the removal of a person from one EU  Member
    State to another is forbidden because there are substantial grounds for
    believing that there is a real risk that the  person  transferred  will
    suffer treatment contrary to article 3 (EM (Eritrea), para 58).

28. The United Kingdom's positive obligations under  article  3  include  a
    duty to protect asylum seekers from deliberate harm by being exposed to
    living conditions (for which  the  state  bears  responsibility)  which
    cause ill-treatment. Article 3 may be engaged  if  asylum  seekers  are
    denied shelter,  food  or  other  basic  necessities  of  life  by  the
    deliberate action of the state. Where, therefore, it can be shown  that
    the conditions in which an asylum seeker will be required  to  live  if
    returned under Dublin Ill are such that there is a real risk that he or
    she will be subjected to inhuman or  degrading  treatment,  removal  to
    that state is forbidden. In this realm  of  positive  obligations,  the
    evidence is "more likely to  partake  of  systemic  failings"  but  the
    search for such failings is "by way of a route to establish that  there
    is a real risk of  article  3  breach,  rather  than  a  hurdle  to  be
    surmounted" (EM (Eritrea), paras 62-63).

29. In the context  of  certification  under  paragraph  5(4),  if  on  one
    legitimate view of the evidence relied on by the applicant, there is  a
    real risk that the claimant would suffer inhuman or degrading treatment
    in breach of article 3, then the Secretary  of  State  cannot  lawfully
    certify that a human rights claim is clearly  unfounded.  The  Tribunal
    has recently confirmed  that  the  evidential  presumption  means  that
    applicants start at a significant disadvantage in evidential  terms  (R
    (SM and others) v SSHD [2018] UKUT 429 (IAC)), para 21).

30. The Tribunal, in considering the risk of an article 3 breach, will take
    account of "practical realities" and "evidence of what happens  on  the
    ground" (EM (Eritrea), para 68). A reduction (even if  significant)  in
    the quality of living conditions does not in itself cross the article 3
    threshold. Nor will applicants succeed by pointing merely to particular
    instances of inhuman or degrading treatment: they will in practice need
    to show that such cases are widespread (NA (Sudan) v SSHD  [2016]  EWCA
    Civ 1060, paras 107-108).

    The parties' submissions at the hearing

31. I heard oral submissions on 24 January 2019. Mr Chirico submitted  that
    the decision to certify the applicant's human rights claim was unlawful
    because the evidence was such that if she were  allowed  to  bring  her
    appeal before the First-tier Tribunal (which would be the  case  absent
    the certification), there  would  be  a  realistic  prospect  that  the
    tribunal might  allow  the  appeal.  In  support  of  this  overarching
    submission, he relied on the AIDA  Update  and  on  Dr  Van  Engeland's
    reports in order  to  submit  that  there  would  be  a  real  risk  of
    significant  delay  in  the  applicant's  further  asylum  claim  being
    registered at the "single desk" (guichet unique) which is  tasked  with
    registering both the asylum claim and the need for  material  reception
    conditions. During that period of delay, there would  be  a  real  risk
    that she  would  be  homeless.  There  would  be  an  ongoing  risk  of
    homelessness  thereafter.  Mr  Chirico  submitted  that  a  period   of
    homelessness would have effects sufficient to engage article 3  of  the
    ECHR on account of the applicant's particular vulnerability.

32. In order to establish the applicant's vulnerability, Mr Chirico  relied
    on four factors: (i) she is a  lesbian;  (ii)  she  is  the  victim  of
    torture; (iii) she suffers from mental  health  problems,  having  been
    diagnosed as suffering from Mild Depression; and (iv) she would  return
    to France as a lone female. He submitted that, taking the  evidence  at
    its  highest  as  the  Tribunal  ought  to  do,  these   four   factors
    cumulatively gave rise to a real risk of  article  3  ill-treatment  in
    France. Accepting that the Tribunal will apply a significant evidential
    presumption that  the  French  authorities  will  comply  with  EU  and
    international obligations to protect the applicant's human  rights,  he
    submitted that the applicant had adduced sufficient evidence  to  rebut
    the presumption in this case.

33. Mr Chirico submitted  in  the  alternative  that  the  evidence  raised
    sufficient doubts in the individual case of  this  applicant  that  the
    Secretary of State should make  further  enquiries  with,  and  seek  a
    specific assurance from, the French authorities  to  confirm  that  the
    applicant would be expeditiously placed within the French asylum system
    with suitable accommodation.

34. In response, Mr  Staker  submitted  in  writing  and  orally  that  the
    threshold for breach of article 3 in Dublin cases is high. None of  the
    evidence on which the applicant relied was  capable  of  reaching  that
    threshold, or  of  rebutting  the  significant  evidential  presumption
    against the applicant.

35. Mr Staker emphasised that the applicant  had  already  made  an  asylum
    claim in France and had in addition sought reconsideration of her claim
    which was in turn refused. Potential difficulties for Dublin  returnees
    in relation to accessing support and assistance must be  considered  in
    the context that the applicant is a failed asylum seeker.  There  could
    be no suggestion that the French authorities had  failed  to  meet  the
    standards of the Refugee Convention or any other binding obligation  in
    EU or human rights law. The  applicant  had  failed  in  any  event  to
    utilise appeal rights in French law to challenge  the  refusal  of  her
    claims.

36. In the absence of any reason to suppose that the applicant would be  at
    risk of any breach of her human rights  in  France,  the  questions  of
    further enquiries and specific assurances did not arise.  The  decision
    was adequately reasoned. The Secretary of State's decision was open  to
    him on the evidence and contained no error of law.

    The parties' submissions after the hearing

37. It became apparent during the  hearing  that  the  Secretary  of  State
    wished to place great emphasis on an argument that had not  formed  any
    part his case until then - either in the grounds of resistance  to  the
    claim or in Mr Staker's skeleton argument. I granted permission to  the
    Secretary of State to submit further submissions in writing which  were
    received (after  an  extension  of  time)  on  18  February  2019.  The
    applicant submitted a written response on 14 March 2019.

38. In his post-hearing submissions, Mr Staker contended that the applicant
    could not expect to be eligible for support under the recast  Reception
    Directive as its minimum guarantees applied only to  those  allowed  to
    remain on  the  territory  of  a  Member  State  as  an  applicant  for
    international protection (Article 3(1)  of  the  Reception  Directive).
    Article 41(1)(b) of the  recast  Procedures  Directive  permits  Member
    States to make an exception from the right to remain in  the  territory
    where a person has (in effect) made  more  than  two  applications  for
    asylum (as this applicant will have done if she makes a further  asylum
    claim on  return  to  France)  provided  only  that  the  Member  State
    considers that the person's expulsion will not lead to refoulement.

39. On this basis, it would be lawful for the French  authorities  to  deny
    the applicant the right to remain in France.  Mr  Staker's  submissions
    went on to describe how various elements of  French  law  lead  to  the
    conclusion that the Reception Directive does not apply in France  to  a
    person who makes (in effect) a  third  asylum  application  unless  and
    until the authorities were to decide to grant a certificate  of  asylum
    application. If the applicant were to be homeless while waiting  for  a
    certificate of asylum application, her situation would not give rise to
    a breach of French or EU law.

40. Mr Chirico in response submitted that the applicant is not a person  to
    whom article 41(b) of the Reception Directive  applies  because,  as  a
    Dublin returnee, she has a  right  to  have  her  case  examined  under
    Article 40(7) of the Procedures Directive. In any event, Article  41(b)
    does not permit a Member State to enact a blanket provision disallowing
    every applicant who has  already  made  two  asylum  applications  from
    remaining on the territory of that Member State.

    Summary of conditions in France

41. Mr Chirico described in great detail the processes for claiming  asylum
    in France. However, his submission was that delays in the system  would
    or could cause the applicant to be homeless for  a  shorter  or  longer
    period, which would trigger an article 3 breach owing to her particular
    vulnerabilities. I do not therefore propose to set out a  comprehensive
    overview of French asylum procedures but I will summarise the  evidence
    which I regard as relevant to Mr Chirico's legal submissions.

    AIDA update

42. The AIDA Update confirms that Dublin returnees are treated  as  regular
    asylum seekers and therefore benefit from the same reception conditions
    granted  to  asylum  seekers  whether  under  regular  or   accelerated
    procedures. It adds (at p.83) that, in practice, "many persons  subject
    to Dublin procedures live on the streets or in squats"[pic]

43. The report describes the  conditions  of  support  and  assistance  for
    Dublin  returnees  as  "really  complicated"  (p.45)  The  humanitarian
    emergency reception centre (Permanence d'accueil d'urgence humanitaire,
    PAUH), run by the Red Cross and based next to Roissy-Charles de  Gaulle
    airport, initially aims to provide people  released  from  the  transit
    zone, after a court decision, with legal and social support.  For  many
    years, without any funding to implement this activity, the  centre  has
    received Dublin returnees at  their  arrival  at  the  airport.  Border
    police issue a "sauf-conduit" which mentions the prefecture  where  the
    asylum seeker must submit the claim. This prefecture may be located far
    from Paris. Dublin returnees have to travel to the prefecture on  their
    own: no organisation or official service meets them.  The  centre  does
    not pay for their travel.

44. When the relevant prefecture is in or around Paris, it may not register
    the  asylum  claim  and  may  channel  the  claimant  to   "orientation
    platforms" (Plateformes d'accueil de demandeurs d'asile,  PADAs)  which
    will in turn make appointments for asylum seekers at the  single  desk.
    While the single desk system was  designed  to  reduce  delays  in  the
    registration of asylum claims  and  to  avoid  long  queues  of  people
    presenting themselves at prefectures, it has in practice  led  to  more
    complexity and delays in accessing the asylum  procedure.  Some  Dublin
    returnees have to wait several weeks before getting an appointment with
    the organisations running the PADA and there may be  further  delay  in
    thereafter getting an appointment at the appropriate prefecture.

45. On the other hand, some prefectures do immediately register the  asylum
    claims of Dublin returnees and channel them to the  French  Office  for
    Immigration and Integration (OFII) in order to find them accommodation.
    Only the PAUH receives and supports  Dublin  returnees  who  arrive  at
    Charles de Gaulle airport.

46. The Update says (at p.46):

             "Considering the  systemic  difficulties  encountered  by  the
             orientation platforms in Paris and its  surroundings,  several
             Dublin returnees, after registering their claim,  are  apt  to
             turn to it in order to complete their asylum claim form or  to
             find an accommodation".

    In Lyon, those returnees who arrive at Saint-Exup�ry airport  encounter
    the same difficulties in terms  of  accommodation  as  those  in  Paris
    (p.46).

47. As to the nature and quality of accommodation for asylum  seekers,  the
    AIDA Update states that asylum seekers may be accommodated in reception
    centres or in any other facility that is funded by the Ministry of  the
    Interior. Some female asylum seekers, victims of human  trafficking  or
    sexual violence have been housed in centres mainly occupied  by  single
    men. In  practice,  single  women  or  men  may  have  difficulties  in
    accessing accommodation centres because families or single parents with
    children are prioritised.

48. The AIDA Update states that in 2016, the average delay in accessing  an
    accommodation centre depended on the area in which  the  asylum  seeker
    submitted his or her claim. In Paris, some asylum seekers  were  unable
    to access accommodation prior to being granted  asylum.  In  Lyon,  the
    average delay between the registration of the asylum claim  and  access
    to housing was 62 days. In Marseille the delay was 101 days and it  was
    around 70 days in Nice. No more up-to-date data was available to me. It
    was the risk of delay in obtaining accommodation that was the  core  of
    the applicant's case.

    Dr Van Engeland's reports

49. Dr Van Engeland reaches similar conclusions to AIDA, namely that  as  a
    Dublin returnee the applicant will enter the asylum  system  again  but
    that, in terms of housing, Dublin returnees form the majority of  those
    asylum seekers living in camps and slums (Addendum report,  9  February
    2018, para 49).

50. Dr Van Engeland says in her Addendum report  that  asylum  seekers  who
    make a fresh claim for asylum upon return to France  under  the  Dublin
    scheme are subject to the same rules as first-time  applicants  (p,10).
    Upon arrival, prospective asylum seekers will have 120 days to go to  a
    PADA funded by the state and managed  by  state-mandated  associations.
    PADAs support asylum seekers before and  after  registration  with  the
    prefecture. Pre-reception and pre-registration support  is  limited  to
    the provision of information about the asylum  process,  assistance  in
    completing relevant  registration  forms,  helping  the  individual  to
    prepare the registration, assessing  the  individual's  background  and
    passing on information to the prefecture, and providing the  individual
    with an appointment at the prefecture. They do not offer financial help
    or housing support.

51. Those Dublin returnees who do not go to a PADA but go straight  to  the
    prefecture to register may be  refused  registration.  If  returned  to
    France, this applicant would face delay in securing the assistance of a
    PADA and getting  an  appointment  for  registration.  The  process  of
    registration with the prefecture and interview by  the  OFII  can  take
    weeks. In Dr Van Engeland's view, will open "the path  to  destitution"
    (p.16). She concludes that  registration  and  eligibility  for  social
    services are interrelated, meaning that the applicant would have to  be
    registered with the prefecture to have access to housing and  benefits.
    As there are delays with registration, she will be  at  risk  temporary
    destitution. She would need a postal address  to  have  access  to  her
    benefits, yet the housing system is stretched.

52. Dr Van Engeland takes the view that, in practice, Dublin returnees  are
    often not accommodated in special housing adapted for their  particular
    vulnerabilities.  It  has  been  reported  by  the  Council  of  Europe
    Commissioner for Human Rights that the failure to help Dublin returnees
    find housing has become systemic such that countries like  Belgium  and
    the Netherlands have not sent asylum seekers back to  France  (Addendum
    report p.22). In Dr Van Engelandts view the  fact  that  the  applicant
    would be a Dublin returnee would increase the risk of destitution.

53. As to the asylum process in France, Dr Van  Engeland  states  that  the
    applicant would as a Dublin returnee be permitted to make another claim
    for asylum which, if refused, would carry a suspensive right of  appeal
    (report, p.12).

    Analysis and conclusions

54. In reaching my conclusions, I have taken the facts of the human  rights
    claim at their highest in accordance with the approach in EM (Eritrea).
    By this I mean that I have assumed in the applicant's favour  that  she
    possesses the four characteristics on which Mr Chirico relies.  It  has
    not in the event proved  necessary  for  me  to  determine  whether  Mr
    Chirico is correct to submit that I should in addition take  the  facts
    about French procedures and conditions at their highest - in the  sense
    of taking the most pessimistic view of the evidence.

    Sexual orientation

55. There is no adequate evidence before me that the applicant would suffer
    any disadvantage in the French asylum system, including  any  reception
    conditions, as a consequence of her sexual orientation.  The  applicant
    does not say that her sexual orientation caused any particular problems
    in France in the past and I was not directed to any objective  evidence
    that this factor -  either  individually  or  cumulatively  with  other
    factors - would in  the  future  contribute  to  inhuman  or  degrading
    treatment or any other human rights violation in France. The height  of
    the evidence seems to be that "LGBTI persons face  strong  difficulties
    when OFII does not provide them with housing, because most of the  time
    they cannot find support in their national communities"  (AIDA  Update,
    p.91). Mr Chirico refers in the most general terms to  observations  of
    the ECtHR about the placement of  LGBT  asylum  seekers  in  facilities
    where they will suffer from the prejudice of other asylum seekers (OM v
    Hungary, Application no 9912/15, para 53). However, the  Tribunal  must
    decide questions of fact on the evidence before it. In my  view,  there
    is an absence of evidence to suggest that the applicant would  be  more
    vulnerable  on  her  return  to  France  on  account  of   her   sexual
    orientation.

    Victim of torture or trauma

56. As I have mentioned, the Secretary of State gave only limited weight to
    Dr Turvill's conclusions  as  to  the  applicant's  scars  because  the
    appearance of the scars is less  than  diagnostic  under  the  Istanbul
    Protocol descriptions.  I  do  not  accept  that  a  putative  tribunal
    considering the applicant's human rights claim would be bound to reject
    Dr Turvill's report and could  not  regard  it  as  probative  of  past
    torture or trauma. The applicant has multiple  scars  that  are  either
    highly consistent with past ill-treatment (meaning that there  are  few
    other possible causes) or typical of ill-treatment (meaning  that  they
    have an appearance that is usually found with the type of ill-treatment
    attributed by the applicant).

57. It is not the function of the Tribunal in these proceedings to consider
    whether the scars support the applicant's substantive asylum  claim.  I
    have been provided with scant evidence  of  the  nature  of  the  claim
    either in respect of whether the applicant has  any  credible  fear  of
    return to Nigeria or whether any fear would be well founded. The  focus
    of the Tribunal is her situation in France. Taking the facts  at  their
    reasonable highest, the applicant must in my view  be  treated  as  the
    victim of some form of past violence and I must consider  whether  this
    past ill-treatment has a bearing on the safety of her return to France.

58. In the present case, there is no medical evidence that the applicant is
    being treated for sequelae  of  past  physical  violence  or  that  she
    suffers any ongoing physical effects other than scarring. Dr  Turvill's
    report does not specify  or  enable  the  Tribunal  to  infer  how  the
    scarring would in itself augment the applicant's  vulnerability  within
    French asylum procedures and reception conditions. There is  inadequate
    evidence to persuade me that the applicant will be less  able  to  cope
    owing to the presence of scars. The medical evidence  is  not  such  as
    would entitle a tribunal on an appeal to find that the applicant was at
    heightened risk of article 3 ill-treatment or that her physical  health
    makes her vulnerable in the manner suggested by Mr Chirico.

    Mental health

59. The third factor on which the applicant relies is her Mild  Depression.
    The AIDA Update states that asylum seekers and  migrants  who  are  not
    granted leave to remain on French territory benefit from State  medical
    assistance which enables the beneficiaries to receive free treatment in
    hospitals  as  well  as  in  any  doctors'  offices.   Psychiatric   or
    psychological counselling remains difficult in  practice  because  many
    professionals refuse to receive non-French speaking  patients  as  they
    lack the tools to communicate non-verbally and the funds to  work  with
    interpreters. Victims of torture or trauma can receive counselling in a
    few NGO structures in Paris, Marseille, Bordeaux, Lyon  and  elsewhere.
    These specialist centres are unevenly  distributed  across  France  and
    cannot meet the growing demand  for  treatment.  They  may  be  located
    several hours away from reception centres.

60. It is therefore possible that an asylum seeker returned to  France  may
    have some difficulty in accessing mental health services.  However,  in
    this case, there is no suggestion that the applicant has  undergone  or
    is in the process of undergoing  specialist  psychiatric  treatment  or
    counselling. There is nothing in her prognosis that persuades  me  that
    she will need it in the future, whether in the  United  Kingdom  or  in
    France.

61. Dr Turvill's report observes (at para 87) that  the  applicant  suffers
    from loneliness,  low  mood,  unhappiness  and  lack  of  energy  while
    describing her as resilient. These symptoms  are  doubtless  upsetting;
    but they fall short of engaging the United  Kingdom's  responsibilities
    under article 3. The report's conclusions about any heightened risk  of
    suicide in France are not clear and are short on detail (see paras  91-
    92). As such, they are not persuasive.

62. In my view, the applicant fails to demonstrate  why  the  diagnosis  of
    Mild Depression will in itself cause any material disadvantage  to  her
    as a Dublin returnee, whether on its own  or  cumulatively  with  other
    aspects of her situation. This factor does not advance her case.

    Lone woman

63. In order to consider the risks for the applicant as a lone  woman,  the
    starting point must in my view be  the  Secretary  of  State's  refusal
    letter which gives the reasons for the decision  under  challenge.  The
    hurdles for Dublin cases are  high  but  fairness  in  judicial  review
    proceedings requires that the applicant should know the reasons for  an
    adverse decision and that the Tribunal be able to satisfy  itself  that
    the reasons are sound in law and rational on the facts.

64. In this case, the  application  of  the  Reception  Directive  forms  a
    material foundation for the decision to certify the  claim  as  clearly
    unfounded. The Directive is cited at paragraph 6 of the refusal  letter
    as part of the  panoply  of  France's  obligations  under  EU  law.  At
    paragraph 23 of the letter, the decision-maker relies on the  Directive
    in  response  to  the  applicant's  concerns  about  rights  to  access
    financial or housing support.

65. At paragraph 33, the decision-maker notes that the Directive lays  down
    minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers and provides that
    Member States shall  ensure  that  material  reception  conditions  are
    available to applicants when they make their applications  for  asylum.
    The Directive is cited to the effect that material reception conditions
    must ensure an adequate standard of living. The decision-maker  asserts
    that the applicant has provided no evidence to  rebut  the  presumption
    that France will comply with its legal obligations in this regard.

66. The adequacy of reception conditions in France is  implied  again  from
    paragraph 43 of the decision which concludes (among other things)  that
    reception conditions do not give rise to an article 3 breach.

67. Despite the reliance on the Reception Directive in the refusal  letter,
    the Secretary of State's final position is that the provisions  of  the
    Directive do not apply to a person such as the applicant who would make
    a third asylum claim in France, unless and until a  decision  is  taken
    that the person will be permitted to remain in France. In my view,  the
    Secretary of State's final position  is  materially  different  to  the
    position of the decision-maker in the refusal letter.

68. That change of position is problematic for a number of reasons.  First,
    the Tribunal is unable to reconcile the position of the  decision-maker
    with the Secretary of State's position in oral and written submissions.
    Secondly, as Mr Chirico  submits,  the  new  position  adopted  by  the
    Secretary of State does not sit easily with Article 40(7) of the recast
    Procedures Directive which stipulates that the responsible Member State
    under Dublin Ill is under a duty to examine any representations made in
    the transferring State. The interpretation of Article 40(7) as  meaning
    that the applicant will be treated as an asylum applicant on return  to
    France is consistent with the AIDA report  which  indicates  (at  p.83)
    that Dublin returnees are treated as regular asylum seekers.

69. Thirdly, as I observed during the hearing, the Secretary of  State  has
    failed to put forward any positive view about how the applicant will be
    accommodated in France. The applicant  has,  on  the  other  hand,  put
    forward some evidence which is capable of suggesting that she  may  not
    be accommodated and may be forced onto the streets.

70. As this Tribunal has observed, the force of the evidential  presumption
    does not absolve the Secretary of State or the Tribunal from  the  task
    of assessing the evidence (SM, para  35).  The  Tribunal  has  a  well-
    defined, supervisory function in judicial review  proceedings,  limited
    to errors of law. But it has long been the case, in proceedings raising
    the safety of third countries, that the courts and  the  Tribunal  have
    considered a wide range of evidence  as  to  conditions  in  the  third
    country (see SM, para 26).

71. The forensic approach adopted by the Secretary of State in this case  -
    which is that I need only consider questions of pure  law  -  fails  to
    recognise the individualised assessment which applies in cases  raising
    the United Kingdom's obligations under article  3.  I  agree  with  the
    Tribunal in SM that in order to  assess  whether  a  claim  is  clearly
    unfounded, the Tribunal must consider the individual facts of  a  claim
    in the context of the background or expert  evidence  relating  to  the
    conditions in the proposed country of removal (SM, para 41). That  does
    not amount to a derogation from the principles of judicial review,  but
    emphasises that, in applying the relevant  legal  tests,  the  Tribunal
    will have in mind  the  relevant  evidence  as  a  foundation  for  the
    exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction. I do not  accept,  therefore,
    that the Secretary of State can simply cite the evidential  presumption
    without assisting the Tribunal with an analysis of the evidence  before
    it.

72. Furthermore, in this case, the Tribunal has been presented with complex
    post-hearing submissions, on questions of law that were flagged for the
    first time on the day of the hearing. The United Kingdom's  obligations
    under article  3  are  absolute  and  this  Tribunal  should  have  the
    assistance of the Secretary of State on the facts and evidence relevant
    to those obligations. While no criticism can be levelled at  his  legal
    representatives, the Secretary of State has had  ample  time  in  these
    longstanding proceedings to formulate and finalise  his  position.  His
    lateness in doing so gives the Tribunal some cause for concern.

73. I do not accept that a lone woman on the streets of Paris or  elsewhere
    could not in principle be regarded as vulnerable to treatment in breach
    of article 3 if faced with temporary homelessness. Vulnerability is, as
    the Tribunal made clear in SM, a question of fact. It is difficult  for
    the Tribunal to assess the applicant's vulnerability when the decision-
    maker has taken different and indeed inconsistent positions as  to  the
    extent to which she is eligible for the protections  of  the  Reception
    Directive. In my judgment, the Secretary of  State's  failure  to  deal
    adequately with the question of whether the applicant as a  lone  woman
    should be treated as a person  with  heightened  vulnerability  in  the
    context of conditions in France amounts to an error of law.

74. I have considered whether or not to treat the error as material to  the
    overall decision  to  certify  the  human  rights  claim.  There  is  a
    presumption about France's adherence to its  international  obligations
    which the applicant must displace. She does not suffer from significant
    physical, psychiatric or psychological problems. She is described by Dr
    Turvill as resilient. She would be returning to a place where  she  has
    lived before. Her account of her experiences in  France  is  brief  and
    vague.

75. On the other hand, the  question  whether  the  applicant's  article  3
    rights will be breached must be  assessed  in  light  of  all  relevant
    factors. There is  no  hint  of  the  Secretary  of  State's  finalised
    position in the  refusal  letter  or  the  grounds  for  resisting  the
    judicial review  application  or  the  Secretary  of  State's  skeleton
    argument. If the applicant is  not  to  be  subject  to  the  Reception
    Directive for a period of time, it is difficult to ascertain  what  the
    Secretary of State considers will happen to her. One possibility  might
    be that the  French  authorities  could  reduce  or  withdraw  material
    reception conditions on the grounds that the applicant  has  made  more
    than one claim for asylum  in  France:  see  article  20(1)(c)  of  the
    Reception Directive mentioned above. However, the  refusal  letter  did
    not rely on article 20 and the Secretary of State's finalised  view  is
    that the scheme of the Directive does not apply. In any  event,  as  Mr
    Chirico submitted, French law and practice under article  20  does  not
    exhaust the question of whether the Soering test may be met.

76. Nor was it any part  of  the  Secretary  of  State's  written  or  oral
    submissions that, if I were to conclude that the decision was erroneous
    in point of law, I should nevertheless refuse  relief  on  the  grounds
    that the error was immaterial or that, absent the  error,  the  outcome
    would not  have  been  substantially  different.  In  these  particular
    circumstances, in which a significant assumption in the refusal  letter
    has effectively been disavowed, the decision must be taken again.

    Other grounds

77. Turning to the applicant's other grounds, it was submitted  in  writing
    that her return to France would give rise to a risk of  refoulement  on
    the basis that the French authorities are guilty of an ongoing  failure
    to transpose the recast  Asylum  Procedures  and  Reception  Conditions
    Directives in relation to accelerated asylum procedures. Although  this
    ground played a part in the applicant's amended  grounds,  it  was  not
    pressed orally.

78.  In  my  view,  this  ground  lacks  merit.  The  applicant  does   not
    particularise, much less  establish,  that  the  consideration  of  her
    asylum claim in the past failed  to  meet  standards  required  by  the
    Refugee Convention or duties of protection laid down on States under EU
    law or the ECHR. The applicant was able to lodge a first  asylum  claim
    which appears to have been duly considered and which carried a right of
    appeal. She was able to lodge a  request  for  reconsideration  of  her
    claim which was duly considered  and  which  too  carried  a  right  of
    appeal. Nor does the applicant challenge the Secretary of State's  view
    that a request for reconsideration of an asylum claim can  be  made  in
    circumstances where the applicant has left France  since  the  previous
    decision: see article L723-15 of the Code de l'entr�e et du s�jour  des
    �trangers et du droit d'asile (Code on the entry and stay of foreigners
    and on the right to asylum).

79. I have considered the passages of Dr Van Engeland's report on which the
    applicant relies for  the  contention  that  she  will  be  subject  to
    deficient asylum procedures on her return  to  France.  Even  at  their
    highest, they come nowhere near displacing the  evidential  presumption
    that France will adhere to international  obligations  in  relation  to
    asylum seekers. The applicant maintains that the one-month  period  for
    her to submit fresh evidence in support of  a  fresh  asylum  claim  in
    France would  be  too  short  and  may  also  have  prejudiced  her  in
    presenting  her  claim  for  reconsideration  in  the  past.  That   is
    speculation only. It is not clear why the timescales for production  of
    evidence - whether in the past or in the future - are not adequate.

80. Mr Staker properly drew my attention to  evidence  that  a  person  who
    makes an asylum claim for the third time may not have a right to remain
    in France while the claim is considered and may not have  a  suspensive
    right of appeal (AIDA Update p.65). Dr Van Engeland in her first report
    takes the view that, as a  Dublin  returnee,  the  applicant  would  be
    permitted to make a fresh claim on grounds of new evidence, which would
    carry a  suspensive  right  of  appeal.  The  applicant's  evidence  is
    insufficiently cogent to demonstrate a risk that she would be  refouled
    to Nigeria and denied the right to remain in the territory in breach of
    the Refugee Convention.

81. The final ground of challenge  relates  to  the  Secretary  of  State's
    consideration of Dr Turvill's report. I have already indicated  that  I
    regard the treatment of the report as flawed. However,  the  flaws  are
    not material to the Secretary of State's overall decision and  I  would
    have declined to grant relief in relation to this aspect of the grounds
    alone.

    Conclusion

82. For the reasons set out above, the application for judicial  review  is
    allowed to the extent that the decision will be quashed  in  order  for
    the Secretary of State to reconsider the applicant's case.

83. It ought to be plain that this case turns on its own facts and  on  its
    particular procedural history. It does not, in the result, say anything
    more general about the safety or otherwise of removing Dublin returnees
    to France.
