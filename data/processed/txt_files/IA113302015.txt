Representation:
For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr Duffy (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the Appellant's appeal against  the  decision  of  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Clarke promulgated on the 27th April  2016,  in  which
       she dismissed the Appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules  and
       on Human Rights grounds, against the Respondent's refusal  to  extend
       discretionary leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the  basis  of
       his claimed subsisting parental relationship  with  his  British  son
       [K].

    2. The full reasons behind Judge  Clarke's  decision  are  a  matter  of
       record and are set out within her judgement, but in  summary,  First-
       tier Tribunal Judge Clarke found that the Appellant had been  granted
       discretionary leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  on  the  20th
       January 2012 which was valid until the 20th January 2015.  On the 5th
       January  2015  the  Appellant  applied  for  an  extension   of   his
       discretionary  leave  to  remain,  which  had  been  refused  by  the
       Respondent on the 16th March  2015.   Judge  Clarke  found  that  the
       Secretary of State was entitled, when considering the request for the
       extension, to take into account  all  of  the  information  that  was
       relevant to the application, including the fact  that  the  Appellant
       had a criminal conviction, which he had failed  to  disclose  on  his
       application, and she concluded that the  failure  to  disclosure  the
       criminal conviction was dishonest.  She went on to find that  in  any
       event, the appeal could not succeed under the Immigration Rules given
       the failure to disclose the material fact of his conviction.

    3. Judge Clarke went on to find that the decision did not  amount  to  a
       breach of the Appellant's Article  8  rights  under  the  Immigration
       Rules, in respect of his family  life,  because  of  the  failure  to
       disclose that material fact, and in respect of his private  life,  on
       the basis that there would not be very significant obstacles  to  his
       reintegration back into life in Ghana and that he had not been in the
       UK for a continuous period of 20  years.   She  then  considered  the
       Appellant's  application  outside  of  the  Immigration   Rules   and
       considered that there would have to be "compelling circumstances"  to
       justify an assessment outside of the rules, but that  in  any  event,
       she went  on  to  make  such  an  assessment,  and  found  that  when
       considering Paragraph 117B(6) of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
       Asylum Act 2002, although accepting that the  Appellant  had  regular
       and weekly contact with his British son, she found that the  Zambrano
       principle did not  apply  and  that  the  refusal  of  leave  to  the
       Appellant did not deprive [K] of the substance of his rights as an EU
       citizen and that there was no suggestion that the Appellant's removal
       from the United Kingdom would necessitate the removal of his son from
       the United Kingdom. She found that although there may  be  disruption
       for [K] he would be able to cope with the change and that  [K]  could
       maintain contact  with  his  father  by  means  of  modern  means  of
       communication.  She therefore found that the decision to  remove  was
       proportionate and dismissed the Appellant's appeal  on  Human  Rights
       grounds outside of the Rules, as well  as  refusing  the  application
       under the Immigration Rules.

    4. The Appellant has now sought to appeal against that decision for  the
       reasons set out within the Grounds of Appeal.  This is  a  matter  of
       record, and is therefore not repeated in full  here.   Permission  to
       appeal has been granted, in respect of what was said to be  ground  2
       of the Grounds of Appeal by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Nicholson  on
       the 20th September 2015.  Judge Nicholson noted  how  it  was  argued
       within ground 2 of the Grounds of Appeal that the Judge had  properly
       failed to consider Section 117B(6) because it  was  argued  that  the
       section was not  predicated  on  the  Zambrano  principles  and  that
       Section 117B(6) stated that there was no public interest in  removing
       an Appellant who was not liable to deportation where an Appellant has
       a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a  British  child
       and it is not reasonable to expect the child to  leave  the  UK.   He
       found that it was arguable that the Judge ought to have  allowed  the
       appeal in line with the comments in Treebhawon  and  Others  (Section
       117B(6)) [2015] UKUT 675.  He therefore granted permission on  ground
       2 of the Grounds of Appeal.

    5. It was on that basis that the appeal came  before  me  in  the  Upper
       Tribunal.  Mr Duffy, on behalf of the Respondent, started the  appeal
       by  conceding  that  the  Learned  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge   had
       sidestepped the actual  issue  relevant  to  the  case  and  had  not
       properly engaged with the issue,  when  considering  117B(6),  as  to
       whether or not it was reasonable to expect [K] to leave the UK and he
       conceded that a material error of law was made out.  He  stated  that
       the Judge had  made  positive  findings  regarding  contact  and  the
       parenting relationship and said that [K] was a British child who  did
       not live with the Appellant but that the  Judge  had  not  considered
       whether it was reasonable for [K] to leave when  considering  Section
       117B(6).  He argued that the case could  be  remade  on  the  papers,
       taking full account the  public  interest  when  considering  Section
       117B(6).

    6. Mr [A] was content for me to  remake  the  decision  on  the  papers.
       However, in respect of the remaking, he told me that he  also  had  a
       daughter, [SA], who was born on the 22nd  October  2012,  who  had  a
       different mother and that [S] was his daughter with his  new  partner
       Ms Christine [C].  He further said that Ms [C] was 8 months  pregnant
       currently and they were looking to get married.  Mr Duffy agreed that
       the fact that Ms [C] was 8 months' pregnant  was  a  relevant  factor
       that could be taken into account, given that I had  to  consider  the
       Article 8 case when remaking the decision, as  at  the  date  of  the
       appeal hearing before me, but he said that although that was a short-
       term factor, the long-term issue was the question of  separation  and
       as to whether or not it would be reasonable for [K] to leave the UK.

  My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality

    7. In light of the concession quite properly made by Mr Duffy on  behalf
       of the Respondent, I do find that  the  Learned  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge did err in law in respect of her analysis of Section 117B(6) of
       the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  That sub-paragraph
       states:

           "117B(6)  In  the  case  of  a  person  who  is  not  liable  to
           deportation, the public interest does not require  the  person's
           removal where -

           (a)     the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
           relationship with a qualifying child, and

           (b)    it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
           the United Kingdom".

    8. The definition of a qualifying child is found in Section 117D, and is
       said to mean a person who is under the age of 18 and who is either  a
       British citizen, or who  has  lived  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  a
       continuous period of 7 years or more.  As quite properly conceded  by
       Mr Duffy on behalf of the Respondent, the test under Section  117B(6)
       is not to be equated simply with the Zambrano principle following the
       case of Zambrano v Office National de L'emploi  case  C-34/O  of  the
       European  Court  of  Justice.   Section  117B(6)  does  not   require
       consideration as to whether or not as a result  of  the  Respondent's
       decision, the child would be required to leave  the  European  Union.
       Although clearly, whether in fact the  child  would  be  required  to
       leave the European Union and therefore whether or  not  the  Zambrano
       principle  would  be  breached  is  clearly  potentially  a  relevant
       consideration,  the  test  that  ultimately  has  to  be  considered,
       however, is whether it would "not be reasonable to expect  the  child
       to leave the United Kingdom".  The question as to whether or  not  in
       fact the child would be  leaving  the  United  Kingdom,  is  not  the
       question, it is simply whether or  not  it  would  be  reasonable  to
       expect the child to leave.  The fact that  in  this  case  [K]  is  a
       British citizen, far from being, as Judge Clarke sought to  argue,  a
       factor  that  counted  against  the  Appellant  under  Zambrano  when
       considering the test under Section 117B(6), if anything, would  be  a
       factor that would tend to mean that it would  not  be  reasonable  to
       expect the child to leave, as if the child were required to leave the
       EU, it would be in breach of his Zambrano rights.  The fact  that  he
       is not going to be required to leave, is not the test.  Judge Clarke,
       as properly conceded by Mr Duffy,  has  not  properly  addressed  the
       question as to whether or not it would be reasonable to expect [K] to
       leave the United Kingdom, when considering  Section  117B(6)  of  the
       Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.   The   reasoning,
       analysis and findings under Section 117B(6)  of  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge Clarke is therefore defective and does  amount  to  a  material
       error of law.

    9. Further, I find that Judge Clarke also erred in law at  [81]  of  her
       judgement, when finding that  there  would  have  to  be  "compelling
       circumstances" to justify an assessment of Article 8 outside  of  the
       Immigration Rules.  The Court of Appeal in the case of SS (Congo) and
       Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015]  EWCA  Civ
       387, is authority for the proposition that there has to be compelling
       circumstances to justify leave being granted outside  of  the  Rules,
       but it was not seeking to establish that there was  an  "intermediate
       test" that had to be satisfied, before a Judge was entitled to go  on
       to consider an Article 8 claim  outside  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
       Indeed, as was stated by the Court  of  Appeal  in  the  case  of  MM
       (Lebanon) and Others v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
       [2014] EWCA Civ 985, made it clear that Mr Justice Sales in the  case
       of R (Nagre) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department,  was  not
       seeking to introduce such an "intermediate test".  Although,  if  all
       of the circumstances were dealt  with  by  the  Rules,  it  would  be
       sufficient for an immigration judge simply to say so, the  Judge  did
       not have to then conduct an intermediate test, in determining whether
       or not there was a good arguable case, before going  on  to  consider
       the case outside of the Immigration Rules, but as made clear  by  the
       Court of Appeal in the case of SS (Congo)  there  would  have  to  be
       compelling circumstances before a case could be  allowed  outside  of
       the Immigration Rules, where the provisions of  the  Rules  were  not
       met.

   10. I therefore do set aside the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Clarke to the extent that she considered that both initially that she
       did not need to conduct an  assessment  outside  of  the  Immigration
       Rules in respect of  Article  8  in  this  case,  and  secondly,  her
       analysis and findings on the alternative basis,  in  respect  of  the
       proportionality assessment for the purposes of Article 8  outside  of
       the Rules, taking into account the provisions of Section  117B(6)  of
       the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

  Remaking

   11. When considering the Appellant's  Article  8  claim  outside  of  the
       Immigration Rules, I do bear in mind that First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Clarke found that the provisions of the Immigration  Rules  were  not
       satisfied, in respect of family life, given the non-disclosure of the
       Appellant of his criminal conviction. This was not challenged.

   12. I also do find that it is [K]'s best interests  to  remain  with  his
       mother in  the  UK,  whom  he  has  lived  throughout  his  life,  in
       circumstances where they are both British Citizens and he should have
       the benefit of growing up in  his  country  of  nationality  for  the
       purposes of section 55 of the Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration
       Act 2009.

   13.   I  also  do  fully  take  into  account  the  Appellant's  criminal
       conviction when considering the Article 8 claim, and this is a factor
       which clearly significantly counts in terms  of  the  decision  being
       proportionate.  Further, as I must, I do take into full  account  the
       provisions of section 117A-D  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
       Asylum Act 2002, and I  do  bear  in  mind  in  particular  that  the
       maintenance of an effective immigration  control  is  in  the  public
       interest and that it is in the public interest that people  who  seek
       leave to remain in the United Kingdom are able to speak  English,  as
       they are better able to integrate into society  and  are  less  of  a
       burden on society. I do  accept  having  heard  from  him,  that  the
       Appellant can speak English.  I also do bear in mind in  this  regard
       that it is in the public interest  that  people  who  seek  leave  to
       remain in the United Kingdom are financially independent and  I  bear
       in mind in this regard the findings of Judge  Clarke  both  that  the
       Appellant  speaks  English  at  paragraph  94  and  that   from   his
       application form he declared that he earned �798 per month  but  that
       in his oral evidence he earned about �255 per week.  I consider  that
       as the Appellant in his application declared that he earned �798, and
       in the absence of any documentary evidence regarding any increase  in
       pay, I find that the Appellant does earn �798 per month  as  declared
       on his application form, which was signed by him as being accurate. I
       therefore do not accept that he is fully financially independent.

   14. I do, however, maintain the findings  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Clarke in respect of the  fact  that  he  does  have  a  genuine  and
       subsisting relationship with his British  child  [K]  and  I  further
       maintain the unchallenged findings of Judge Clarke at paragraphs  [50
       to 52] of her judgement, in regard to her acceptance of the  evidence
       of both Miss [C] that she collected [K] from school, as she  did  not
       attend classes on Friday and she would normally cook for [K] and  the
       appellant and that they would  then  sit  down  and  watch  something
       depending on how tired they were and [K] would then go  to  be  about
       10.00pm on a Friday and that she would  then  look  after  [K]  on  a
       Saturday morning until the Appellant got back. Judge Clarke  accepted
       the evidence of both Miss [C] and the Appellant that on Saturdays the
       Appellant took [K] to the park or to football  and  on  Sundays  they
       would go swimming before [K] returned to his mother's full-time care.
        Judge Clarke accepted that the Appellant had an ongoing relationship
       with his British son and that he enjoyed contact with his  son  on  a
       weekly basis at weekends, which findings I maintain.

   15. It is also relevant in this case that the Appellant is no longer in a
       relationship with [K]'s  mother  and  they  separated  in  2011,  and
       although there is no formal contact order from the  court,  as  Judge
       Clarke found, the couple in fact are to be congratulated, in terms of
       having  agreed  contact  between  them,  without  the  necessity   of
       resorting to court proceedings. But it is clear and I do  accept  and
       maintain the findings of Judge Clarke that [K] does not live with the
       Appellant, his father, and that his father only sees him at weekends,
       and that the Appellant and [K]'s mother are separated and  no  longer
       live together.  I further accept and  find  that  [K]  is  a  British
       citizen  as  was  found  by  Judge  Clarke,  which  finding  was  not
       challenged.

   16. When looking at Section 117B(6), therefore, I do accept and find as a
       fact that the Appellant is not a person who is liable to deportation,
       and that he does have a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
       with a qualifying child, [K], who is a British citizen and who is now
       aged 10 years old having been born on the 1st August 2008 and who  is
       therefore aged under 18.  In respect of the question  of  whether  it
       would be reasonable to expect the child to leave the United  Kingdom,
       I have fully taken account of  the  public  interest  considerations,
       including, in this case, the fact that maintenance  of  an  effective
       immigration control is in the public interest and that it is  in  the
       public interest that people who seek leave to remain are  financially
       independent and are able to  speak  English,  and  my  findings  that
       although he is  working,  the  Appellant  is  not  fully  financially
       independent, although I do accept the finding of Judge Clarke that he
       is not said to be on benefits, but clearly, the level of  his  income
       is such as to mean that he cannot  be  considered  fully  financially
       independent.

   17. I further do bear in mind, as stated by Judge Clarke in  her  summary
       of the Appellant's immigration history at paragraphs 3 and 4  of  her
       decision that on his own account the  Appellant  entered  the  United
       Kingdom in 2011, and it was  not  until  January  2012  that  he  was
       granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  There therefore  does
       appear to be an 11 year period where the Appellant as here illegally,
       and this is a factor which I have clearly fully taken account  of  in
       determining the wider public interest considerations when considering
       the  issue  of  reasonableness  in  terms  of  whether  it  would  be
       reasonable to expect [K] to leave the United Kingdom.  I further bear
       in mind in this regard the  Appellant's  criminal  conviction,  which
       also Judge Clarke found that he had dishonestly failed to disclose on
       his application.

   18. I also bear in mind that little weight  should  be  attached  to  any
       private life the Appellant has built up, at a time when he  has  been
       here illegally and at a time when he his status has been  precarious,
       and that little weight should be attached to a relationship formed at
       a time when the Appellant has been here illegally.  However  in  this
       regard, I do bear in mind that the Appellant is separated from  [K]'s
       mother, and that his new relationship,  started  after  he  had  been
       granted leave to remain in January 2012.

   19. It is of importance in this case that the Appellant is no longer in a
       relationship with [K]'s mother and that although [K] previously lived
       for a time with the Appellant, after his mother ceased  her  studies,
       it was agreed between [K]'s mother and the Appellant that  [K]  would
       go back to live with her and that the Appellant  only  sees  him,  at
       weekends.  I therefore accept and find as a fact that [K]'s mother is
       his primary carer.  It is also relevant in this regard that [K] is  a
       British citizen, as is his mother, and that given that  [K]'s  mother
       and the Appellant are no longer in a relationship, this is not a case
       where [K], his mother and the Appellant would be returning  to  Ghana
       as a family unit.  I also bear in mind that not only is he a  British
       citizen, but that [K] has never lived in  Ghana,  and  seemingly  has
       lived all of his life in the UK.

   20. In such circumstances, even  bearing  in  mind  the  public  interest
       considerations, which I have to do following the Court of Appeal case
       of MA (Pakistan) and  Others  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
       Department,  when  considering  the  position  and  the  question  of
       reasonableness under Section 117B(6), I do find that it would not  be
       reasonable for [K] to leave  the  United  Kingdom,  in  circumstances
       where he lives with his mother who is a British citizen, where he  is
       a British citizen, and he himself has never lived  it  Ghana  and  it
       cannot be said to be reasonable that he simply then go and  lives  in
       Ghana with his father, whom he only sees at  weekends,  and  that  he
       thereby be separated from his mother.  There is  no  reason  why  his
       mother would go to Ghana to live there, when she is no  longer  in  a
       relationship with the Appellant.  I therefore do find that  it  would
       not be reasonable to expect [K] to leave the United Kingdom.

   21. In such circumstances, the conditions in Section 117B(6) are met, and
       as was stated by Lord Justice Elias in the case of MA (Pakistan)  and
       Others at paragraphs 19 and 20, in such circumstances, if the  answer
       to the first question as  to  whether  the  Appellant  is  liable  to
       deportation is no, then the answer to the other 3 questions in  terms
       of whether or not the Appellant does have a  genuine  and  subsisting
       parental relationship with a qualifying child  who  is  a  qualifying
       child and it is unreasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the  UK,
       then the conclusion must be that Article 8 is infringed.

   22. In such circumstances, given my findings in respect to the answers to
       the questions posed by Section 117B(6) I therefore do find  that  the
       Appellant's removal would be a disproportionate infringement  of  his
       right  to  a  family  life  for  the  purposes  of  Article  8.   The
       Appellant's removal would therefore breach his rights  to  a  private
       life under Article 8, and the decision made is therefore unlawful and
       contrary to Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Clarke  does  contain  material
errors of law and is set aside to the extent set out above.

I remake the decision, allowing  the  Appellant's  appeal  on  Human  Rights
grounds outside of the Immigration Rules.

I do not make any order in respect of anonymity, no such order  having  been
sought before me.
