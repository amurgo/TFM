                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction

    1. The claimant is a citizen of India born in 1992. He  applied  for  a
       permanent residence card as the former spouse of Ms Sima  Tuzinaite,
       a Lithuanian citizen. His application  was  refused  on  31st  March
       2017. His appeal against the  decision  was  allowed  by  First-tier
       Tribunal  Judge  C  H  O'Rourke  under  the  EEA  Regulation  in   a
       determination promulgated on the 10th November 2017.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Scott Baker on 7th December 2017 on the basis that it  was  arguable
       that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law in  finding  that  the
       claimant was entitled to permanent residence.

    3. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law.

Submissions - Error of Law

    4. In the grounds of appeal the Secretary of  State  accepts  that  the
       claimant and his ex-wife were lawfully and genuinely  married;  that
       the claimant's ex-wife was working at the point of the divorce;  and
       that the claimant has shown  he  was  working  as  required  by  the
       relevant EEA Regulations. It is argued however that the claimant  is
       not entitled to permanent residence as the evidence with respect  to
       the ex-wife's work showed insufficient earnings for the  period  end
       of October 2012 to 5th April 2013, and thus that  the  finding  that
       the claimant  met  Regulation  15(1)(f)  of  the  Immigration  (EEA)
       Regulations 2006 was not lawfully open to the  First-tier  Tribunal.
       Mr Bramble accepted that that the  evidence  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal showed that the claimant's  ex-wife  had  earned  ï¿½258  per
       month from a cleaning job during this time. The question was whether
       this showed the claimant's ex-spouse  was  genuinely  working  as  a
       cleaner during this period.

    5. Mr Nasim submitted that in accordance with  the  decision  in  Begum
       (EEA  -  worker  -jobseeker)  Pakistan  [2011]  UKUT  275  this  was
       sufficient as  in  EU  law  whether  someone  was  working  was  not
       conditional on the  amount  of  income  derived.  The  question  was
       whether the work was "effective and genuine" and  not  "marginal  or
       ancillary" and thus having no economic value. The  letter  from  the
       claimant's ex-wife's employer at page 135 of the bundle  shows  that
       she was genuine working in a job  which  had  economic  value  as  a
       cleaner/ room attendant from October 2012.

Conclusions - Error of Law

    6. I find that although the decision that the appellant is entitled  to
       permanent residence under Regulation 15(1)(f) of the EEA Regulations
       is not fully reasoned at paragraph 25 of the decision that there  is
       no material error of law in the decision as the evidence before  the
       First-tier Tribunal was such that the claimant's ex-wife was clearly
       a worker during the full five  year  period,  including  the  period
       October 2012 to April 2013, as she was doing work which was  genuine
       and effective during this time as her cleaning work was genuine  and
       had economic benefit to her employer, and at no point  in  time  was
       that work on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary.

          Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  involve
      the making of an error on a point of law.

   2. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the claimant's appeal
      under the EEA Regulations and finding the  claimant  was  entitled  to
      permanent residence is therefore upheld.
