Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms S Akhtar, instructed by ANB Law
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Asam Ali,  date  of  birth  10.2.78,  is  a  citizen  of
    Pakistan.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Herwald  promulgated  31.12.14,  dismissing  his  appeal  against   the
    decisions of the respondent, dated 17.7.14,  to  refuse  him  leave  to
    remain in the UK on the basis of family life and to remove him from the
    UK pursuant to section 47 of the Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act
    2006.  The Judge heard the appeal on 12.12.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Landes  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    20.2.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 28.5.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Herwald should be set aside.

 6. The appellant had separated from his wife but had some form of  contact
    with his daughter, now 2 years of age, at  a  contact  centre.  It  was
    asserted that the appellant and his wife had  reconciled  a  few  weeks
    prior to the appeal hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.

 7. In the First-tier Tribunal it was conceded on behalf of  the  appellant
    that he could neither meet paragraph 276ADE  nor  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules. The judge found in any event that even  if  Appendix
    FM did apply, there were no insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
    continuing outside the UK. However, the judge also found that there was
    no genuine reconciliation between the appellant and his former partner,
    as claimed. Neither did the judge find any compelling circumstances  so
    as to justify, exceptionally, considering the appellant's  private  and
    family life outside the Rules. Nevertheless, the judge  went  on,  from
    �25 of the decision, to consider Article 8 family life rights, applying
    the Razgar stepped approach, taking into account the best interests  of
    the child pursuant to  section  55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act 2009, and section 117B of the  2002  Act.  At  �29  the
    judge concluded that  any  interference  was  insufficiently  grave  to
    engage Article 8, but at �30 that even if  Article  8  is  engaged  the
    interference would be proportionate.

 8. Much of the balance of the decision set out the judge's cogent  reasons
    for concluding that the appellant had not  reconciled  with  his  wife,
    stating at �37 it was perfectly clear that the appellant was lying. The
    judge highlighted stark and serious discrepancies  and  inconsistencies
    between the evidence of the appellant and his wife. At  �44  the  judge
    concluded that the reconciliation was a  charade  for  the  purpose  of
    court proceedings.

 9. It is significant that the wife and his daughter have both British  and
    Pakistani nationality; they had visited Pakistan in November  2013  and
    they speak Urdu. At �46 the judge took into account the best  interests
    of the child and concluded that if there is any family life,  they  can
    continue that in either  Spain,  where  the  wife  went  to  marry  the
    appellant, or Pakistan. Whilst,  as  British  citizens,  the  wife  and
    daughter cannot be compelled to leave the UK that is not the same thing
    as it being unreasonable on the facts of this case to expect them to do
    so, should they wish to continue  the  claimed  family  life  with  the
    appellant.

10. In granting permission to  appeal,  Judge  Landes  found  the  grounds,
    primarily  directed  towards  the  judge's  findings  on  the   spousal
    relationship, "very thin." I find that the judge gave clear and  cogent
    reasons for concluding that the appellant and his wife were not telling
    the truth and that they had not reconciled at all.

11. Judge Landes also found that given the judge's finding that  there  had
    been no reconciliation, there was no arguable merit in the ground  that
    the judge failed to consider that the wife had been born in  and  lived
    all her life in the UK. In effect, there was no family  life  with  his
    wife that he could rely on.

12. However, Judge Landes considered it an arguable error of law  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge failed to consider the impact on the daughter
    of the appellant being removed from the UK if, as the judge found,  the
    appellant and his wife had not reconciled  and  given  that  the  child
    evidently had regular contact with the appellant, but the  child  would
    likely be remaining in the UK if the relationship between  her  parents
    had in truth broken down.

13. In her submissions, Ms Akhtar relied on the best interests of the child
    and her ties to the UK, including her mother, grandparents and extended
    family in the UK, as well as her contact with the appellant. The  child
    and mother had lived all their lives in the UK. It was  submitted  that
    it would be unreasonable to expect the mother and child to relocate  to
    Pakistan. However, I find that the judge has given cogent  reasons  for
    finding it would be reasonable. It cannot be said that this finding  is
    irrational, perverse or unsupported by cogent reasons.

14. In summary, I find that there was little  or  no  evidence  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal of any likely adverse effect on the  child  if  the
    appellant were to be removed; the burden of demonstrating this being on
    the appellant. The appellant and his wife were separated and  the  only
    contact he had with his daughter was necessarily  very  limited,  given
    that it was only at a  contact  centre.  In  essence,  there  was  very
    little, if any, evidence of the  strength  of  connection  between  the
    appellant and his daughter. I bear  in  mind  that  at  A95  there  are
    photographs said to be of the appellant with his  daughter,  which  one
    might well regard as staged, given  there  appears  to  be  no  genuine
    purpose for the photographs other than to support his application,  and
    at A147 a letter suggesting that contact has been agreed. However,  the
    letter, dated 3.9.14, states that contact is for an hour once  a  week.
    It  is  stated  that  this  will  be  reviewed  once  the  child  feels
    comfortable in his sole care.  However,  there  was  no  evidence  that
    contact had progressed beyond the one hour a week.

15. The evidence adduced by the appellant, including as to his relationship
    with the child was poor, limited, and in the main not accepted  by  the
    judge, who found the appellant to be a liar who could not get his story
    straight. In essence, the judge rejected the appellant's  case  in  its
    entirety. Nevertheless, the judge specifically took  into  account  the
    best interests of the child in the Article 8  assessment.  If,  as  the
    appellant claimed, the couple had  reconciled,  the  judge  found,  for
    cogent reasons set out in the decision, that it would be reasonable  on
    the facts of this case for the family to  continue  their  family  life
    outside  the  UK,  either  in  Spain  or  Pakistan.  If  they  had  not
    reconciled, as the judge in fact found, there was insufficient evidence
    before the Tribunal to demonstrate that in an Article 8 proportionality
    assessment  that  the  best  interests  of  the  child   in   retaining
    intermittent contact with the appellant outweighed the public  interest
    in removing the appellant who had no relationship with a partner in the
    UK and no alternative basis to remain in the UK.

16. I find that the conclusion of the First-tier Tribunal was one  open  to
    the judge on the limited evidence before the  Tribunal  and  for  which
    cogent reasons have been provided.

Conclusion & Decision

17. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.
