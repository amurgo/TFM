Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr R Jesurum, instructed by Kinas Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Mustafa Kelepircioglu,  date  of  birth  15.5.81,  is  a
    citizen of Turkey.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Parker promulgated 28.1.15, dismissing his appeal against the  decision
    of the respondent to refuse his application made on 3.7.14 for  an  EEA
    Residence Card as confirmation of a right to reside in the UK, pursuant
    to the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.  The Judge heard the  appeal
    on 14.1.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Mailer  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    12.3.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 20.5.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein, I find no material error of law in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such  as  to  require
    the decision of Judge Parker to be set aside.

 6. The relevant background can  be  summarised  briefly  as  follows.  The
    appellant who first came to the UK in  2009  as  a  student  has  twice
    previously been refused leave to remain,  in  2010  and  2011  and  was
    served as an  overstayer  on  28.10.13.  The  application  for  an  EEA
    Residence Card was decided following a marriage interview on 28.10.14.

 7. The application was refused because the Secretary of State reached  the
    conclusion, in the light of the discrepancies that came to light during
    the marriage interview, that the marriage of the appellant with  Serife
    Demir is a marriage of convenience, arranged solely for the purpose  of
    enabling the appellant to remain in the UK. The refusal  decision  sets
    out a number of the more significant discrepancies.  The  Secretary  of
    State is not required to recognise a marriage of  convenience  and  the
    provisions  of  the  Regulations  do  not  apply  to  a   marriage   of
    convenience.  A marriage of convenience is one entered into solely  for
    immigration purposes.

 8. Judge Parker reached the conclusion at �24 of the  decision  that  "the
    discrepancies regarding their time together  are  so  fundamental  that
    challenges other factors such as  alleged  cohabitation  I  would  find
    that, in all the circumstances, the marriage had no substance and  this
    is a marriage of convenience."

 9. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Mailer considered  it  arguable
    that the judge may not have considered  the  evidence  of  cohabitation
    adduced by the appellant, and may have overemphasised the  significance
    of the discrepancies. However, as set out in the Rule 24 response dated
    24.3.15, the grounds of application for permission  to  appeal  are  in
    reality no more than an attack on the weight given by the judge to  the
    various parts of the evidence, where weight is a matter for  the  judge
    to determine. The  nature  and  extent  of  the  discrepancies  in  the
    marriage interview are so obviously  significant  as  to  outweigh  any
    countervailing evidence in  favour  of  the  appellant,  including  the
    evidence of cohabitation. Further it is not inconsistent  with  a  sham
    marriage for there also to be an element of cohabitation. The test of a
    marriage of convenience is not cohabitation or an intention to cohabit.
    In the light of the inconsistencies, some of which  are  summarised  in
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal between  �18  and  �24,  it  is
    difficult to see how the judge could have reached any other  conclusion
    than that this was from its inception a marriage of convenience. As  Mr
    Jesurum accepted in his oral submissions, the  discrepancies  disclosed
    in the marriage interview  discharged  the  evidential  burden  on  the
    Secretary of State so that the  burden  shifted  to  the  appellant  to
    demonstrate on the balance of probabilities that the marriage is not  a
    marriage of convenience.

10. It is clear from the decision of the First-tier Tribunal that the judge
    took into account the appellant and  his  spouse's  witness  statements
    attempting  to  explain  the  marriage  interview  discrepancies;   the
    photographic evidence; the evidence of cohabitation; and the  witnesses
    called on their behalf  at  the  appeal  hearing.  However,  the  judge
    reached the conclusion at 19 that there are "vast  differences  between
    them at interview and I have only  touched  upon  some  of  them."  For
    example,  the  judge  highlighted  at  �18  significant   discrepancies
    regarding their first meeting; the engagement ring;  the  night  before
    the wedding;  where  they  lived  before  the  wedding;  who  were  the
    witnesses; and how they got to the wedding. They were even inconsistent
    as to where they stayed the night  before  the  marriage  interview  in
    Liverpool. I can only agree with the judge's conclusion at  �22,  which
    cannot be described as either irrational or perverse,  that  one  would
    expect the parties to a genuine marriage to know where they each  spent
    the night before the  wedding  and  interview;  how  they  got  to  the
    wedding; and the wedding night.

11. Having considered the evidence of the various  witnesses,  I  can  only
    agree with the judge's view at �22 that the  evidence  from  their  own
    knowledge was limited. Some of the statements are quite  formulaic  and
    rather brief. In  the  main  they  speak  of  their  knowledge  of  the
    appellant and say little about the sponsor. Attempts by Mr  Jesurum  to
    criticise the findings of the judge and to  rely  on  explanations  for
    discrepancies, such as confusion and imperfect  recollection,  together
    with his review of the witness statements adduced  on  the  appellant's
    behalf, were no more than an attempt to reopen the issues in the appeal
    and a disagreement with the judge's findings, for which I  find  cogent
    reasons were given. Mr Jesurum did not represent the appellant  at  the
    appeal and was not in any  position  of  strength  to  comment  on  the
    judge's assessment of the oral evidence. I find  the  judge's  decision
    neither irrational nor perverse, and one fully open to the Tribunal  on
    the evidence.

12. Article 8 ECHR was not relied on at  the  appeal  and  on  the  judge's
    findings any article 8 ECHR assessment outside  the  Regulations  would
    have found insufficient family  life  between  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor to engage article 8 at all. As the refusal decision  explained,
    the Secretary of  State  has  not  considered  article  8  and  if  the
    appellant wishes to make an application for  leave  to  remain  on  the
    basis of private and/or family life, he must make a separate chargeable
    application on the specified form.

Conclusions:

13. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: the appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
