For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS



   1. This is an appeal against a decision by Judge of the First-tier
      Tribunal Handley dismissing an appeal against refusal of leave to
      remain.




   2. The appellant is a national of the USA.  She entered the UK in 2012
      with leave as a fianc�e.  In the same year she was given limited leave
      as a spouse.  In 2015 she applied for further leave as a spouse.
      Rather unusually in a case where leave to enter was given under the
      Immigration Rules, the appellant's husband is a French national
      exercising Treaty rights in the UK.




   3. This application was considered by the Secretary of State under
      Appendix FM and refused because the appellant did not provide the
      specified documentary evidence to show that the maintenance
      requirement of �18,600 was satisfied.




   4. In evidence to the First-tier Tribunal the appellant said she is
      working full time as an auxiliary nurse.  The appellant's husband also
      gave evidence about his employment.  He further stated that the couple
      had completed the application form themselves after making inquiries
      about the evidence that was required.




   5. The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal found that the appellant had not
      met the requirements for the provision of specified documents in
      relation to maintenance under Appendix FM.  It was argued before the
      First-tier Tribunal that the appellant should have been given an
      opportunity to submit additional evidence before the Secretary of
      State refused her application.  The judge found, however, that this
      was not a case where one of a series of documents had been omitted,
      where a document was in the wrong format, where a copy was provided
      instead of an original, or where a document did not contain all the
      specified information.  The appellant had failed to provide the
      required documents with her application.




   6. In respect of paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM, the judge pointed out
      that the test of "insurmountable obstacles" was a high hurdle to
      overcome.  Having regard to the family circumstances, backgrounds and
      careers of the appellant and her husband, the judge was not satisfied
      that there were insurmountable obstacles that would prevent family
      life continuing outside the UK.




   7. Turning to Article 8, the judge found the refusal decision was not a
      disproportionate interference with the appellant's right to respect
      for her private or family life.  This finding took into account the
      fact that the appellant's husband is an EEA national exercising Treaty
      rights in the UK and that there was therefore an alternative route
      through which the appellant would be entitled to reside here.




   8. Permission to appeal was granted by the Upper Tribunal on the basis
      that it was arguable that the judge erred by not making a finding on
      whether the substantive maintenance requirement was met, which might
      have been material to the assessment under Article 8.  The other
      grounds of the application were considered arguable.  These included
      the question of whether the appellant should have been asked for
      additional evidence before her application was refused.  It was
      pointed out that the appellant's husband has a right of permanent
      residence, which should have been taken into account in the balancing
      exercise under Article 8.




   9. At the hearing before us, Mrs Farrell explained that she was pursuing
      the appeal on the instructions of the appellant after they had had a
      discussion about the routes she might follow.  Mrs Farrell
      acknowledged that the documentary requirements of the Immigration
      Rules were not met at the time the application was made.  She
      submitted that the appeal should nevertheless be allowed under Article
      8.  Mrs Farrell pointed out that the appellant had first come to the
      UK before the Immigration Rules changed.  She had returned to the USA
      and then re-entered the UK.  Mrs Farrell drew to our attention the
      Immigration Directorate Instructions on missing documents.




  10. The difficulty we have with this appeal is ascertaining the basis on
      which the Secretary of State's refusal decision could be said to be
      disproportionate under Article 8.  There is no evidence of any
      intention by the Secretary of State to remove the appellant from the
      UK and, as she is the spouse of an EEA national with a right to reside
      here, there seems to be no lawful basis for removal.  It has not been
      demonstrated before us that it is disproportionate for the Secretary
      of State to require the submission of specified documents with
      particular categories of application.  Indeed, it might be considered
      that all that the Secretary of State did was to refuse an application
      which was not made with the proper documents.  In the circumstances of
      this appeal this does not amount to a disproportionate interference
      with the appellant's right to respect for her private or family life.




  11. Having considered the arguments made on behalf of the appellant, we
      are satisfied that the Judge of the First-Tier Tribunal was entitled
      to reach the decision which he did and did not err in law in so doing.






      Conclusions




      The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve
      the making of an error of law.  We do not set aside the decision.




      Anonymity




      No anonymity direction was made by the First-Tier Tribunal.  We have
      not been asked to make such an order and see no reason of substance
      for doing so.
