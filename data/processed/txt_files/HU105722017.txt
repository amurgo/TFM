                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the appellant:     Mrs Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the respondent:    Ms Pickering, Counsel instructed by Parker Rhodes
                    Hickmott Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The appellant ('the SSHD') successfully appealed against  a  decision
       of the First-tier Tribunal ('FTT') dated 17 April 2018  in  which  it
       allowed the appeal of the respondent ('MS')  against  a  decision  to
       refuse his human rights claim dated 7 September  2017.   I  found  an
       error of law in the FTT decision in a decision sent  on  20  November
       2018 and gave directions for MS to provide all evidence  relied  upon
       in a comprehensive bundle and for the  SSHD  to  provide  a  position
       statement in response.  In this decision I remake MS's appeal.

Background

    2. MS is a citizen of Zimbabwe. He first arrived in the  United  Kingdom
       ('UK') in 2006 as a working holiday maker.  He returned  to  Zimbabwe
       and entered the UK again as a student in 2008 with leave until  2010.
       On 16 November 2009 MS  was  sentenced  to  12  months  imprisonment,
       having pleaded guilty to being concerned in the proceeds of crime  by
       acquiring criminal property.  Deportation proceedings  followed,  and
       he unsuccessfully appealed against a deportation order on asylum  and
       human rights grounds.  He  became  appeals  rights  exhausted  on  31
       August 2010.

    3. On 19 February 2014, MS  was  sentenced  to  12  months  imprisonment
       suspended for 12 months, on pleas of guilty to counts  of  theft  and
       making false  representations  for  gain.   In  a  decision  dated  7
       September 2017 the SSHD refused his human rights claim to  remain  in
       the UK.

    4. As the FTT observed in its decision, by the time of its hearing on 11
       April  2018,  MS's  circumstances  were   very   different   to   the
       circumstances as at the last FTT hearing in 2010.  The FTT considered
       that MS and his partner, B, provided credible evidence  and  accepted
       it entirely.   The bare factual background in support of  MS's  claim
       to remain in the UK on the basis of Article 8 as summarised below  is
       not disputed.

        i) MS has a daughter, T, born in January  2014.   T  is  a  British
           citizen.  His relationship with T's mother, A, ended in  October
           2014, with T remaining living with her mother (T's  grandmother)
           in Greater Manchester.

       ii) A was opposed to contact and MS issued family  proceedings.   In
           an order dated 20 September 2017 a final order was  made  giving
           MS a gradual  timetable  of  contact  with  T.   This  began  as
           indirect contact, then contact at a contact centre.  By the time
           of the April 2018 FTT hearing MS had  contact  with  T  twice  a
           week.

      iii) That contact has increased and developed.  A now fully  supports
           contact.  Indeed  MS  assists  A  in  taking  T  to  school  and
           collecting her from school 3-4 times  a  week.   There  is  also
           extensive weekend and school holidays contact.

       iv) MS began a relationship with a new partner, B, in 2015  and  her
           son J, with whom he lives in Doncaster.

    5. The above represents the basic factual  background  only.   The  more
       detailed facts  are  set  out  below.   Although  the  basic  factual
       background is not in dispute,  there  are  aspects  of  the  evidence
       adduced on behalf of MS and by MS which are not necessarily accepted.
        I address this evidence in more detail below.

Hearing

    6. At the beginning of the hearing before me, both parties accepted that
       as a result of MS's 12 months sentence of imprisonment in 2009, he is
       a "foreign criminal" and he must meet the requirements in the
       Immigration Rules for 'medium level' offenders, who have been
       sentenced to at least 12 months but under four years imprisonment.
       Mrs Pettersen accepted that all the requirements of 399(a) and (b) of
       the Immigration Rules are met save in one respect each.  The SSHD did
       not accept that it would be unduly harsh for T or J (for the purposes
       of 399(a)) or B (for the purposes of 399(b)) to remain in the UK
       without MS.  Ms Pickering made it clear that the updated evidence and
       her submissions focus entirely upon the relationship between MS and
       T.   That includes a report dated 20 December 2018 prepared by Mr
       Stott, an independent social worker ('ISW').  Both representatives
       agreed that the factual background must be considered by reference to
       the principled approach in sections 117A to C of the Nationality,
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, as explained in KO Nigeria v SSHD
       [2018] UKSC 53.

    7. Unfortunately MS's solicitors only submitted a woefully inadequate 51-
       page bundle.  This did not include a witness statement to explain the
       relevance of the evidence contained in that bundle.  In addition, it
       was only on the morning of the hearing that Ms Pickering appeared to
       discover from MS that an ISW report had been prepared but not served.
        Arrangements were made to obtain this.  The hearing was then
       adjourned to enable Ms Pickering to take an updated statement from MS
       and then for myself and Mrs Pettersen to read the further evidence.
       I enquired whether MS was the only witness and was told by Ms
       Pickering that he was.

    8. MS relied upon the witness statement he prepared that morning.  Mrs
       Pettersen cross-examined him, and I asked questions in clarification.

    9. Mrs Pettersen invited me to find that the evidence, including the
       views of the ISW was simply insufficient to reach the high threshold
       required by the unduly harsh test.

   10. Ms Pickering submitted that there are particularly compelling
       features in this case, which supported a finding that the high
       threshold set out in KO was met vis a vis T.  In this case T would be
       deprived of more than just mere contact with her father.

   11. At this point and for the first time during the course of the
       hearing, Ms Pickering referred to an updated witness statement from
       A.  Mrs Pettersen and I did not have a copy of this statement and the
       matter once again had to be adjourned for copies to be made.

   12. MS's solicitors failed to comply with directions to provide all
       evidence relied upon in one paginated bundle by 20 December 2018.
       This has caused inconvenience and delay to both parties and to the
       Tribunal.  The SSHD completely ignored the direction to provide a
       position statement.  There was no excuse or explanation from either
       party.  This is increasingly common and regrettable.  The Upper
       Tribunal faces a difficult task when remaking appeals of such
       significance to both parties and the public interest.  Bespoke
       directions have a purpose and should be respected.  I indicated at
       the hearing that I expected that the managing partner of Parker
       Rhodes Hickmott solicitors, will be able to offer a written
       explanation for the failings in this case and to provide the
       necessary assurances that the failings exposed in this case will not
       be repeated, within seven days of the hearing.

   13. The hearing resumed after lunch and after I had an opportunity to
       consider A's witness statement dated 30 January 2019 and supporting
       letters written in December 2018 from T's grandmother, A, B and MS's
       friend of over 15 years.  In these letters the authors each describe
       a very close and loving relationship between MS and T.  Mrs Pettersen
       did not wish to ask MS any questions arising from this and Ms
       Pickering resumed her submissions.

   14. Ms Pickering relied upon three particular features to support her
       submission that the impact of MS's deportation on T would be unduly
       harsh.  Her submissions can be summarised as follows

        i) Speech therapy - MS has led the way in this and is the key
           contact in the facilitation of speech therapy.  The speech
           therapy has brought them even closer. The successful completion
           of the speech therapy is contingent on TS's involvement.

       ii) ISW report - This has been prepared by an independent and
           experienced social worker and as such considerable weight should
           be attached to his views on the impact of separation upon T,
           particularly bearing in mind T is a child that does not cope
           well with change (2.15 and 1.16), she has a particularly close
           relationship with her father (2.16 and 2.19), and T has already
           had to cope with two significant changes in her life: her move
           to primary school from nursery and her mother commencing full-
           time University.  Her father's role is all the more important
           given these changes.

      iii) Nature and extent of contact - letter from school dated 17
           December 2018 echoes the ISW report that MS is a very supportive
           influence in T's life.

   15. In response to my request for clarification, Ms Pickering accepted
       that her submissions deliberately focussed solely upon T and this
       reflected MS's case: although he has a relationship with B and J, in
       the light of the FTT's findings and the evidence available, his sole
       focus for the purposes of this hearing is upon the submission that
       the effect of his deportation on T would be unduly harsh (on the
       basis as everyone accepts, she shall remain in the UK with her
       mother).

   16. I reserved my decision, which I now provide with reasons.

Legal framework

   17. Paragraphs 399 and 399A are reflected within section 117C of the 2002
       Act.  This states:

           "(1)   The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public
           interest.

           (2)    The more serious the offence committed by a foreign
           criminal, the greater is the public interest in deportation of
           the criminal.

           (3)    In the case of a foreign criminal ('C') who has not been
           sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the
           public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or
           Exception 2 applies.

           (4)    Exception 1 applies where -

                (a)    C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom
                for most of C's life,

                (b)    C is socially and culturally integrated in the United
                Kingdom, and

                (c)    there would be very significant obstacles to C's
                integration into the country to which C is proposed to be
                deported.

           (5)    Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting
           relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and
           subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and
           the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be
           unduly harsh.

           (6)    In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced
           to a period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public
           interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling
           circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1
           and 2."

   18. It is to be noted however that the question whether "the effect" of
       C's deportation would be "unduly harsh" is broken down into two parts
       in paragraph 399, so that it applies where:

           "(a)   it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in the
           country to which the person is to be deported; and

           (b)    it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain in the
           UK without the person who is to be deported."

   19. In the instant case it is only the second limb of 399 set out at (b)
       above, as reflected in section 117C(5) that requires consideration,
       as far as the children are concerned.

   20. The correct approach to paragraphs 399(b) and section 117C of the
       2002 Act has recently been considered by the Supreme Court in KO.
       In the only judgment, Lord Carnwath said this at [23]:

           "One is looking for a degree of harshness going beyond what
           would necessarily be involved for any child faced with the
           deportation of a parent. What it does not require in my view
           (and subject to the discussion of the cases in the next section)
           is a balancing of relative levels of severity of the parent's
           offence, other than is inherent in the distinction drawn by the
           section itself by reference to length of sentence."

   21. Lord Carnwath also approved of the following guidance relevant to the
       term "unduly harsh" at [27]:

           "Authoritative guidance as to the meaning of "unduly harsh" in
           this context was given by the Upper Tribunal (McCloskey J
           President and UT Judge Perkins) in MK (Sierra Leone) v Secretary
           of State for the Home Department [2015] UKUT 223 (IAC), [2015]
           INLR 563, para 46, a decision given on 15 April 2015. They
           referred to the "evaluative assessment" required of the
           tribunal:

                "By way of self-direction, we are mindful that 'unduly
                harsh' does not equate with uncomfortable, inconvenient,
                undesirable or merely difficult. Rather, it poses a
                considerably more elevated threshold. 'Harsh' in this
                context, denotes something severe, or bleak. It is the
                antithesis of pleasant or comfortable. Furthermore, the
                addition of the adverb 'unduly' raises an already elevated
                standard still higher."

   22. It is therefore now clear from KO that the assessment of "unduly
       harsh" does not require a balancing of the relative level of severity
       of the parent's offence.   The assessment solely requires a careful
       consideration of whether the elevated threshold is reached from the
       point of view of ether the child or partner.  If that threshold is
       met then deportation would be a breach of Article 8 of the ECHR and
       no further analysis is required.

   23. In BL (Jamaica) v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 357 the Court of Appeal
       concluded that the Tribunal did not undertake a sufficient inquiry
       into whether there was any other family member who could be able to
       care for his children and emphasised the need to consider the extent
       to which social services would be able to assist in reducing the
       adverse impact of the children losing their father to deportation at
       [53].

           "What the UT did in the course of their detailed and no doubt
           conscientious decision was to accept KS's son's evidence that KS
           could not manage her money and drank more that was good for her
           and made the inference that without BL the family would descend
           into poverty and require the support of social services. As
           against this, however, KS had looked after the family while BL
           was in prison or immigration detention and the UT had not made
           any findings that the family had then descended into poverty or
           required the support of social services, or that if that were to
           happen, there would not be adequate support services for these
           children. The UT were entitled to work on the basis that the
           social services would perform their duties under the law and,
           contrary to the submission of Mr Rudd, the UT was not bound in
           these circumstances to regard the role of the social services as
           irrelevant. The Secretary of State had made the point in the
           decision letter that there was no satisfactory evidence that KS
           had not coped with the children's upbringing in BL's absence and
           so the UT were aware that this point was in issue. KS's son's
           evidence was an insufficient evidential basis for the UT's
           conclusion on this point. His evidence was in reality
           uncorroborated and self-serving hearsay on this issue."

Findings

   24. In reaching my findings, I have applied the preserved factual
       findings made by the FTT, but updated these findings in the light of
       the further evidence available to me.



MS's relationship with T

   25. I entirely accept that MS has a close relationship with T that has
       strengthened over time.  MS lived with A and T in Manchester when T
       was a baby during the course of 2014.  A financially supported all
       three of them and MS was T's primary carer at the time.  The
       relationship between MS and A broke down toward the end of 2014 and
       the beginning of 2015.  MS did not see T for the first half of 2015
       when he was on remand.  MS lived with A and T briefly on his release
       but has been living with B in Doncaster since August 2015.  There
       then followed a lengthy period of some two years when A prevented MS
       from seeing T.  That changed from September 2017 when a contact order
       was drawn up in family proceedings.  Contact commenced gradually at
       first but after a few months MS was seeing T for full days on the
       weekends and during the school holidays.  Mr Stott has described in
       his report, and I accept, that since T started school in September
       2017,  MS's involvement in T's care has increased further.  He now
       shares the school run with A and is very involved in taking her to
       extra-curricular activities such as swimming.

   26. I do not doubt that MS and T love each other dearly.  Since returning
       to her life MS has been a doting father.  He has loved her and cared
       for her when her mother has been working and studying.  He has played
       an important role in school life at T's school - see the letter from
       T's class teacher dated 17 December 2019 and 2.21-2.24 of the ISW
       report to this effect.  In addition, MS has been instrumental in
       initiating and taking part in speech therapy sessions with T.  He has
       made financial sacrifices by paying for her activities and treats for
       her birthday.  T's best interests clearly support the continued
       presence of MS in her life in the UK.    She would be deprived of
       regular contact with the only father-figure in her life.  He plays an
       important role in her life even though they do not live together on a
       full-time basis.  He makes a valuable contribution to her happiness
       and well-being.  T's best interests are to be treated as a primary
       consideration.

   27. I do not accept that T's speech therapy sessions would not be able to
       continue without MS.  I appreciate that MS has been significant in
       conducting the speech therapy sessions.  However, the work he has
       done can and will be replicated by A.  I note that they "co-parent"
       and according to the ISW at 2.13 share the transportation duties to
       school (albeit MS probably does a little more of the school run).  I
       entirely accept that A and T's grandmother are in full-time study and
       employment respectively.  I acknowledge that it will be difficult and
       inconvenient to make adjustments to their schedules in order to take
       T to school and collect her after school on a daily basis and in
       order to ensure that she attends her speech therapy, as well as extra-
       curricular activities.  I do not accept that without MS in the UK it
       will be impossible for T to be well looked after and taken to every
       appointment and activity that is necessary for her well-being.   I am
       confident that by working together and flexibly the responsible
       adults in T's life shall be able to ensure that she attends the
       requisite speech therapy appointments.  A has explained in her
       statement that her University course is full-time and ends at 5pm
       each day.  Given that the speech therapy is likely to be limited in
       time, it is difficult to see why A cannot leave a little early to
       attend the remaining sessions.  I note that according to the ISW A
       has been able to undertake some of the transportation to and from
       school.  There is also the potential for T's grandmother to take
       annual leave or adjust her working hours in order to assist in this
       area on a temporary basis.  I was told that she lives in Manchester
       city-centre and is therefore well-placed to assist with school
       arrangements.  I note that Mr Stott has recorded in his report that
       prior to MS's increased involvement, A was assisted by her mother,
       sister or a friend.  I accept the evidence from A that the current
       arrangement is better for T as she receives consistent care from her
       parents.  However it remains the case that A has the support of
       others to the extent that she finds this necessary to care for T.

   28. T resides with A and has a close relationship with her.  A has  coped
       with very difficult times in the past  when  she  did  not  have  the
       benefit of MS's assistance and has demonstrated sustained resilience.
        Although A's siblings reside in southern England, MS explained  that
       they assist A and T's grandmother in funding private education for  T
       in Manchester.  A obviously has a close relationship with her  family
       members and she can turn to them for emotional and financial support.
        Practical support may be more difficult because  the  siblings  live
       far away, and the grandmother has a full-time job as a  cleaner.   MS
       indicated during oral evidence that this means that  the  grandmother
       will only be able to see T and is only able to assist on a Sunday.  I
       do not accept this evidence.  A full-time job  does  not  necessarily
       mean that a person cannot assist with school drop offs and  pick-ups.
       Families with two working parents manage.   In  addition,  I  do  not
       accept that from  time  to  time  T  could  not  be  collected  by  a
       childminder, friend or if necessary stay in after school  club.   The
       family clearly are able to find the  resources  to  pay  for  private
       education.  It may be more convenient and cheaper for MS  to  collect
       T, but it is not necessary.    However, no doubt T would much  prefer
       for the current arrangements with her father to continue and  I  bear
       this in mind when factoring in her best interests.

   29. Ms Pickering emphasised that there was evidence that T does not  cope
       well with change and would not be able to  cope  with  the  momentous
       change  of  losing  her  father.   Most  children  cope  better  with
       established routines.  T is no different.  Ms Pickering  reminded  me
       that T has had to cope very recently with  two  significant  changes:
       she has moved from nursery to  primary  school  and  her  mother  has
       started full-time education.  I also note that A has described in her
       letter that T has found it difficult  to  cope  with  family  members
       moving to Australia and there are "frequent occasions"  when  T  gets
       emotional and distressed.  These are normal events that children have
       to cope with.  T has settled into her new school and is  coping  well
       with her changed routine.  She is likely to  find  the  loss  of  her
       father challenging and distressing.  As her class teacher put it this
       is likely to be felt as a "devastating blow" for a child aged  5.   A
       explained that T would be "devastated"  and  would  not  be  able  to
       understand why MS is no longer around for her.  However T  will  have
       the love and support of her mother, her mother's family members,  her
       school friends and teachers during this time.  I have no  doubt  that
       although it will be initially difficult for  T,  with  the  love  and
       support around her, she will be able to cope.

   30. I have carefully considered Mr Stott's concerns and analysis.  I have
       no doubt that his views are genuinely held.  I accept that MS has  in
       the last few months in particular been making a major contribution to
       T's care and upbringing and is genuinely  committed  to  a  long-term
       relationship.  I accept that T is a central part of MS's life and  he
       is a central part of her life.  I accept that  in  the  short-term  T
       would be very upset about the loss of her father and this may have  a
       negative effect on her school and home lives. However, when  all  the
       evidence is considered in the round, I have concluded that  Mr  Stott
       has overstated the position when he concludes that  T  would  not  be
       able, with time and support, to make  sense  of  and  cope  with  the
       sudden loss of her father.  Mr Stott's conclusion  that  there  is  a
       high risk of T suffering trauma is not particularised  or  explained.
       No timeframe is provided.  The nature and the extent of the trauma is
       unexplained.  T does not live with her father on  a  full-time  basis
       and will have her mother and her  mother's  circle  of  support  from
       family and friends.  The impact of MS's  deportation  will  be  harsh
       upon T and  she  will  suffer  emotionally.   This  will  clearly  be
       contrary to her best interests but with time and support it cannot be
       properly said that the effect on T will be unduly harsh.

   31. At [35] of KO, Lord Carnwath made  it  clear  that  when  making  its
       alternative assessment regarding the impact of KO's deportation,  the
       judge applied "too low a standard" and treated  unduly  harsh  as  no
       more than "undesirable".  The impact on the  children  in  KO's  case
       might be said to be more serious than in the present case.  KO  lived
       with his children, their relationship could not be described as short-
       lived and the main household income would be lost by his deportation.
        None of these apply here.  MS has not lived with T since she  was  a
       baby.  Contact resumed  in  2017,  albeit  since  then  it  has  been
       increasingly intensely positive for T.  T's mother coped without MS's
       support after they separated to  such  an  extent  that  she  opposed
       contact for an extended period of time.  Although  he  provides  some
       financial support with the assistance  of  B,  MS  is  not  the  main
       household income source.  It  is  A's  family  members  who  pay  her
       private school fees.

   32. MS's deportation will adversely affect T's best interests, but  I  do
       not accept that it would involve a degree of harshness  going  beyond
       what  would  necessarily  be  involved  for  any  child   face   with
       deportation of a parent.  The nature and extent of the speech therapy
       required by  T  comes  nowhere  close  to  constituting  particularly
       compelling or compassionate circumstances.   T is  a  happy,  settled
       member of her class, who works hard and has a  positive  attitude  to
       learning.  Although she may  find  it  difficult  to  work  alongside
       someone else, I have no doubt that with the support she has, she will
       also work hard at her speech therapy, even  in  the  absence  of  her
       father.  The end of the patently close relationship between MS and  T
       will undoubtedly be very sad.  I  do  not  however  accept  that  the
       effect of MS's deportation will be unduly harsh on T.



MS's relationship with B

   33. There is no dispute that MS and B have a genuine and subsisting
       relationship.  However, it quite properly has not been argued on MS's
       behalf that the effect of his deportation on B (or J) would be unduly
       harsh.

Private life

   34. Ms Pickering did not rely upon MS's private life, but I address it
       for the sake of completeness.  The consideration of 399A and section
       117C(4) involves three elements.  MS is unable to meet both the first
       and third of these.

        i) MS has not had any leave since he became appeals rights
           exhausted in 2010.  In any event, MS is 35 and cannot be said to
           have been lawfully present in the UK for most of his life.

       ii) MS is probably social and culturally integrated into the UK.

      iii) Having undertaken a broad evaluative judgement (see SSHD v
           Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813), I do not accept that MS has
           established that there would be serious obstacles to re-
           integrating into Zimbabwe.  MS has been resident in the UK for a
           lengthy period, but this began when he was an adult.  He has
           demonstrated resilience and a sustained ability to adapt to his
           new environment.  Those traits and that experience can be
           applied to his advantage in Zimbabwe.  I bear in mind that there
           have been widely publicised recent human rights abuses toward
           those perceived to support protests against the government in
           Zimbabwe.  I have not been taken to any evidence that MS will be
           perceived adversely given the current climate in Zimbabwe. There
           is no suggestion that he cannot easily make friends. There is no
           reason why, initially at least, he should not be supported by
           his partner and friends in the UK.

   35. In order for the exception in paragraph 399A or section 117C(4) to
       apply, MS would need to establish all three elements. In my judgement
       he only meets the second requirement. The exception therefore does
       not apply to him.

Very compelling circumstances

   36. MS has been unable to meet any of the statutory exceptions.  Ms
       Pickering did not make any submissions to this effect but for the
       sake of completeness I have gone on to consider all matters in the
       round and whether viewed cumulatively, these are sufficient to give
       rise to very compelling circumstances - see Hesham Ali v SSHD [2016]
       UKSC 60 and KE (Nigeria) v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 1382.

   37. MS's offending is at the lower end of the scale.  His risk of
       reoffending is probably low. There are also protective factors to
       assist in the maintenance of the low risk of offending.    He has
       demonstrated resilience in rebuilding his life.  He is clearly
       committed to and has a close relationship with T as well as his newer
       family with B and J.  These are indicators that demonstrate MS's
       clear commitment to living a good and law-abiding life in the UK.  I
       have already described MS's very close family relationship with T, B
       and J and aspects of his private life.  MS speaks English very well
       and between his partner and his own earning potential is likely to be
       financially independent.  These matters relevant to section 117B of
       the 2002 Act therefore militate in his favour.  Even when all
       relevant matters are viewed cumulatively, they do not amount to very
       compelling circumstances.  Whilst B and the children will find MS's
       deportation difficult and it will be contrary to their best
       interests, it's effect does not meet the threshold required to be
       unduly harsh.  They will cope with time and support.  MS will find
       life in Zimbabwe initially difficult but has the requisite skills and
       resilience to integrate.   The public interest in his deportation may
       have lessened over time but it still remains.

Decision

   38. I remake the decision by dismissing MS's appeal.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
