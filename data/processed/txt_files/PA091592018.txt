                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW

      1. By letter dated 9  January  2019,  Mr  Howells  on  behalf  of  the
         Secretary of State wrote to the Tribunal conceding that grounds (i)
         and (ii) disclosed errors of law and invited the Tribunal to  remit
         the protection and human rights appeals to the First-tier  Tribunal
         to be heard afresh.

      2. I direct that this appeal  is  remitted  to  Hatton  Cross  Hearing
         Centre for hearing. A Singalese interpreter is required. There  are
         likely to be two witnesses (the appellant and  her  husband).  Time
         estimate: 2 ï¿½ hours.




                                                               ANDREW JORDAN
                                                 DEPUTY UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE
