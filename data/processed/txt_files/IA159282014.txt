Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Chowdhury of Universal Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who was  born  on  5  November
    1991.  He arrived in the United Kingdom on 16 July 2012 with  leave  to
    enter as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant valid until  10  May  2014.
    On 17 February 2014, he made an application for further leave to remain
    as a  Tier  4  (General)  Student  Migrant  under  para  245ZX  of  the
    Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended) to undertake an Extended  Diploma
    in Management (NQF level 5) at the Citizen 2000 Education Institute.

 2. On 27 March 2014,  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  appellant's
    application for further leave under para 245ZX of the Rules and made  a
    decision to remove him  under  s.47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.  The Secretary of State was  not  satisfied  that
    the appellant met the maintenance  requirements  of  Appendix  C,  para
    1A(h) on the basis that he had not submitted a required bank  statement
    to show that he had available �1,600 for a  consecutive  period  of  28
    days prior to the date of application.

 3. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a  determination
    promulgated on 7 November 2014, Judge Britton dismissed the appellant's
    appeal.  First, he was not satisfied that  the  appellant  had,  as  he
    claimed before the judge, submitted the required  bank  statement  and,
    therefore, the appellant could not meet the requirements of the  Rules.
    Secondly, the judge was not satisfied that the "evidential flexibility"
    rule in para 245AA applied because the  required  documents,  namely  a
    bank statement and bank certificate, were "missing".

 4. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on  the
    basis that the judge had been wrong in law: (1) not to accept that  the
    appellant had submitted the required document with his application and;
    (2) to conclude that paragraph 245AA did not apply; and (3) in  failing
    to consider the appellant's human rights claim under Art 8.

 5. On 22 December 2014, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge V P McDade) granted
    the appellant permission to appeal on those grounds.

 6. On 12 January 2015, the Secretary of  State  filed  a  rule  24  notice
    opposing the appeal.

 7. Thus, the appeal came before me.

 8. The judge dealt with the evidence of the bank statement and certificate
    at paras 5-8 of his determination and did not accept, on a  balance  of
    probabilities, that the appellant had submitted the required  documents
    with his application.  The judge said this:

         "5.  The appellant in a statement dated 22 October 2014  stated  in
             summary that his overseas bank statement (BRAC  Bank  Ltd)  at
             the time of his application showed funds of  BDT  15,47,105.00
             (�11877.00) for 28 consecutive days.  The respondent requested
             the appellant to send further photographs but did not  request
             documents relating to his maintenance.  He has paid  the  full
             tuition fees in the sum of �2500 for his current course.

         6.   In evidence the appellant said he  sent  the  bank  statements
             together  with  photographs   with   his   application.    The
             respondent wrote asking him for copies of the photographs  but
             not for his bank statements.  The appellant said the documents
             he referred to in the Notice of Appeal (p7 of the  appellant's
             bundle) were his bank statements and certificate.

         7.   The appellant was referred to the Brac Bank statement dated 20
             February 2014, but not signed until 26.02.2014.  The appellant
             said he sent his application form with the bank  statement  on
             the 15 February 2014 together with  all  his  documents.   The
             appellant's application was received by the respondent  on  17
             February 2014.

         8.   It was pointed out to the appellant that  he  could  not  have
             sent the bank statements with  his  application  as  the  bank
             certificate and  bank  statements  are  dated  later  than  15
             February  2014,  the  date  he  said  he  sent  them  to   the
             respondent.  The appellant said the Brac Bank must have made a
             mistake."

    At paragraph 10 the judge then concluded:

         "I find that the appellant did not send his bank statement and bank
         certificate with his application because they are  dated  after  15
         February 2014."

 9. Mr Chowdhury, on behalf of the appellant made three submissions.

10. First, Mr Chowdhury submitted that the judge had  been  wrong  to  find
    that the  appellant  had  not  submitted  a  bank  statement  and  bank
    certificate as required by the Rules with the application by relying on
    the fact that they post-dated  the  application.   Both  are  dated  20
    February 2014 whilst the application was made on 15 February 2014.   He
    submitted that the bank statement and certificate before the judge were
    copies obtained by the appellant after making the  application  because
    he failed to retain copies himself.  He submitted that  they  reflected
    in substance what was contained in  the  original  documents  submitted
    with the application.

11. When I raised with Mr Chowdhury whether there was any  evidence  before
    the judge that the documents dated 20 February 2014 were  presented  to
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  not  as  copies  of  the  originals  but  as
    subsequently obtained and dated copies,  Mr  Chowdhury  was  unable  to
    point to any evidence to that effect.   Indeed,  as  I  understood  his
    submissions, the matter had  only  been  raised  with  the  appellant's
    representatives in the course  of  preparing  for  the  Upper  Tribunal
    hearing.

12. The only relevant evidence before the Judge was that  set  out  in  the
    appellant's own statement dated 22 October 2014 at para 5:

         "I had submitted my overseas bank statement (BRAC Bank Limited)  at
         the  time  of  my   application   which   showed   the   funds   of
         BDT15,47,105.00 (�11,877.00) for 28 consecutive  days  as  per  the
         Immigration Rules: Please see enclosed  copy  statement  from  BRAC
         Bank."

13. As Mr Richards pointed out in his submissions, the judge  was  entitled
    to consider that the bank statement and certificate  submitted  at  the
    appeal hearing were copies of the actual bank statement and certificate
    submitted with the  application  but  which,  inconsistently  with  the
    appellant's case, bore a date subsequent to the application.

14.  I  also  drew  to  Mr  Chowdhury's  attention  a  bank  statement  and
    certificate which were dated  10  February  2014  and  which  had  been
    submitted to the Upper  Tribunal  by  the  appellant's  representatives
    under a letter dated 9 April 2015.  I enquired how it  was  that  these
    were dated prior to the application but the appellant's case was he had
    not kept copies of those he had submitted with  his  application.    Mr
    Chowdhury accepted these were not before the judge but were also copies
    obtained by the appellant subsequent to submitting his application.  As
    I understood Mr Chowdhury's submission they were, in  fact,  copies  of
    what had actually been submitted.  I need only say that  this  is  very
    curious indeed.

15. The appellant's appeal had to be decided on the basis of  the  evidence
    relied upon before the Judge.  The only documents before the Judge were
    those dated 20 February 2014 which post-dated the  application.   There
    was, in truth, no  evidence  before  the  judge  other  than  the  bank
    statement and bank certificate relied upon  were  copies  of  the  ones
    submitted with the application.  As such, it was open to the  judge  to
    find (indeed the finding was inevitable) that as they  both  post-dated
    the application, the appellant had failed  to  establish  that  he  had
    submitted these documents with his application.  The judge did not  err
    in law in making that finding.

16. Further, Mr Chowdhury submitted that, nevertheless,  the  judge  should
    have found in the appellant's favour under the Immigration Rules on the
    basis of the 20 February 2014  documents.   That  argument  is  without
    merit.  The effect of s.85A(3) of the NIA Act 2002 is  that  the  judge
    could only consider documents which were submitted with the application
    to determine whether the requirements of the Rules were met.

17. Having found these documents were not submitted with  the  application,
    the judge inevitably had to dismiss the appellant's  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

18. Secondly, Mr Chowdhury submitted that the judge had  erred  in  law  by
    failing to consider the appellant's claim under Art 8 of the ECHR.

19. He submitted that the appellant had been in the UK for two  years,  had
    made significant progress and had completed his course in January  2014
    and was now seeking leave for a new course.  If the appellant were  not
    allowed  to  remain,  he  would  suffer  significantly  in  his  future
    prospects and money spent  on  his  previous  course  would  have  been
    ineffective to achieve what he wished.  There was also a risk that  his
    family would not support him in the future.

20. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Richards  submitted  that  it  was  not
    clear whether the appellant had actually  relied  upon  Art  8  at  the
    hearing although Art 8 was raised and relied upon  in  the  appellant's
    grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.   However,  he  submitted
    that even if it was raised, there was no evidence of family or  private
    life beyond the fact that the appellant had studied  in  the  UK.   The
    grounds put the appellant's case on the basis of "fairness" but in  the
    absence of any relevant factor to the appellant's  claim  under  Art  8
    beyond the fact that he had studied, that claim was bound to  fail  and
    the judge's error in failing to consider Art 8 was not material.

21. There is no doubt that the appellant relied upon Art 8 in  his  grounds
    of appeal (see paras 12-15 of the grounds).  It is not clear  from  the
    determination,  however,  whether  the  appellant,  through  his  legal
    representative, actually relied upon Art 8 at  the  hearing.   For  the
    purposes of this appeal, I will assume that the appellant did  continue
    to rely on Art 8.  As a consequence, the judge erred in law by  failing
    to consider a ground of appeal relied upon (see s.85(2) of the NIA  Act
    2002).  However, in my judgment that error  was  not  material  to  the
    decision.  I agree with Mr Richards' submission that the  Art  8  claim
    was bound to fail.

22. There was very limited evidence indeed about  the  appellant's  private
    life in the UK restricted, effectively, to the fact that he had studied
    for a little over two years  at  the  date  of  the  hearing.   He  had
    successfully completed his  study  up  to  that  point.   However,  his
    present application for leave was to undertake a new course  of  study.
    The judge was, no doubt, aware of the appellant's evidence contained in
    his written statement (at para 11) that  he  had  spent  money  on  his
    studies in the UK  and  that  he  claimed  that  it  would  affect  him
    "socially and economically" if he was unable to complete  his  studies.
    However, the appellant's Art 8 was palpably weak.  As the Supreme Court
    pointed out in Patel and Others v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72 at [57] per  Lord
    Carnwath:

         "It is important to remember  that  Article  8  is  not  a  general
         dispensing power.  It is to be distinguished from the Secretary  of
         State's discretion to allow leave  to  remain  outside  the  Rules,
         which may be unrelated to any protected right.   The  merits  of  a
         decision not to depart from the Rules are not reviewable on appeal:
         Section 86(6).  One may sympathise with Sedley LJ's call in Pankina
         for 'commonsense' in the application of the Rules to graduates  who
         have been studying in the UK for some years (see  para  47  above).
         However, such considerations do not by themselves  provide  grounds
         of appeal under Article 8,  which  is  concerned  with  private  or
         family  life,  not  education  as  such.   The  opportunity  for  a
         promising student to complete his course in this  country,  however
         desirable in general terms, is not  in  itself  a  right  protected
         under Article 8."

23. In this appeal, the appellant did not rely upon any family life in  the
    UK.  His private life was restricted to the fact that he had undertaken
    courses successfully for some two years prior to the hearing.   He  now
    wished to undertake a new course.  He could not establish that  he  met
    the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules,   in   particular   the
    maintenance requirements in Appendix C.  His inability to  further  his
    studies may, no doubt, have had some implications for him in the future
    although those are necessarily speculative.  But, he had no human right
    protected under Art 8 to continue his studies  per  se.   Even  if  his
    private life is interfered sufficiently seriously to  engage  Art  8.1,
    given all the circumstances of his case and the limited evidence of his
    private life in the UK, the inevitable  conclusion  must  be  that  any
    interference with that private life was proportionate.  The failure  to
    grant him leave under Art 8 outside the Rules could not be demonstrated
    to have unjustifiably harsh consequences so as to outweigh  the  public
    interest in effective immigration control (see s.117B(1) of the NIA Act
    2002 inserted by s.19 of the Immigration Act 2014).

24. Consequently, for these reasons, the judge's failure to consider Art  8
    was not material to his decision as, in my judgment, no rational  judge
    could conclude on the basis  of  the  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that the appellant could succeed under Art 8 (see AJ  (Angola)
    v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 1636 at [49] per Sales LJ).

25. Thirdly, Mr Chowdhury indicated that the appellant's  previous  sponsor
    had now been removed from the sponsors' register and the appellant  was
    required to find a new sponsor.  Since his English language certificate
    was out of date, he had to take the language test again.  For this,  Mr
    Chowdhury indicated that he required a certified copy of  his  passport
    which was currently held by the Home Office.  Mr Chowdhury  invited  me
    as a matter of justice to direct the Secretary of State to provide  any
    certified copy of the  appellant's  passport.   He  told  me  that  the
    appellant's representatives had written to  the  Home  Office  about  a
    month ago but had not yet received any reply.

26. As I indicated at the hearing, this is a matter between the appellant's
    legal representatives and the Secretary of State it is not a matter for
    the Tribunal which has no power to make a direction  as  sought  by  Mr
    Chowdhury.

27. One final point.   In  the  course  of  his  submissions,  I  asked  Mr
    Chowdhury whether he continued to rely upon  the  judge's  approach  to
    para 245AA and  the  so-called  'evidential  flexibility'  policy.   He
    indicated that he had no submissions to make in relation to para 245AA.



28. Of course, reliance upon para 245AA is, in a  sense,  contrary  to  the
    appellant's primary submission  that  he  sent  the  documents  to  the
    Secretary of State.  However, the  judge  was  undoubtedly  correct  to
    conclude that  para  245AA  could  have  no  application  to  "missing"
    documents which were not part of a "sequence" (see  para  245AA(b)(i)).
    As para 245AA(c) makes clear, the "evidential  flexibility"  rule  does
    not apply simply where a "specified document has not  been  submitted".
    That was precisely the situation found to be the case by the judge  and
    therefore  he  was  correct  that  para  245AA  could  not  assist  the
    appellant.

Decision

29. For these reasons, the First-tier Tribunal did not  materially  err  in
    law in dismissing the appellant's appeal.  That decision stands.

30.  The  appellant's  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is,   accordingly,
    dismissed.



                                                                      Signed
