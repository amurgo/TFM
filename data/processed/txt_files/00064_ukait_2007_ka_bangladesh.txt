Charles Simmons, Solicitors
For the Respondent:          Mr W Khan, Home Office Presenting Officer

The restriction in paragraph 95(vi) to a  maximum  of  twelve  months'  work
applies whether the work is full time or part time.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, born on 1 January 1984, is a citizen of Bangladesh.   He
    applied for  entry  clearance  to  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  working
    holidaymaker for a period of two years.  His application was refused on
    30 August 2006.  He appealed to the Tribunal and  following  a  hearing
    before Immigration Judge Haynes on 14 February  2007,  his  appeal  was
    dismissed.

 2. The appellant applied for reconsideration of the  decision  and  Senior
    Immigration Judge Waumsley ordered reconsideration of the decision on 3
    April 2007.  He ordered reconsideration in the following terms:-

        "The ground on which the appellant has applied  for  an  order  for
        reconsideration may be summarised as follows:


              1. In concluding that the appellant's sponsor did not have the
                 financial means to maintain the appellant for the whole  of
                 his proposed  two-year  working  holiday,  the  Immigration
                 Judge erred in failing to  take  account  of  the  guidance
                 contained in the Immigration Directorate's instructions  at
                 chapter 4, section 2, annex C.;


              2. He erred in concluding that it would not  be  open  to  the
                 appellant to work part-time for the whole of  his  two-year
                 stay, if so minded.

        Those grounds, particularly ground 2, raise arguable pints  of  law
        which merit further consideration.   Reconsideration  is  therefore
        ordered, limited to the issues raised in the appellant's grounds."

 3. The relevant Immigration Rule is paragraph  95  of  HC395,  it  is  not
    necessary to set out in full.  The  rule  does,  however,  require  the
    appellant to demonstrate that he:-

        "(iv)    has the means to pay for his return or onward journey; and
           v) is able and  intends  to  maintain  and  accommodate  himself
              without recourse to public funds; and
          vi) is intending only to take employment incidental to a holiday,
              and not to engage in business, or to provide  services  as  a
              professional sports person, and in any event not to work  for
              more than 12 months during his stay; and
              ...
        viii) intends to leave the United Kingdom at the end of his working
              holiday".


 4. If the requirements of the Rules are otherwise met, entry clearance and
    accordingly leave to enter, will be for a  period  not  to  exceed  two
    years.

 5. The Notice of Refusal  issued  to  the  appellant  indicated  that  the
    respondent was not satisfied that the appellant met the requirements of
    sub-paragraphs (iv), (v), (vi) and (viii) of paragraph 95.

 6. The Immigration Judge found at paragraphs 10 to  14  inclusive  of  the
    determination that he could not be satisfied that the appellant had met
    the requirements of the relevant sub-paragraphs of paragraph 95.  It is
    helpful at this stage to set out in full that part of the determination
    in which the Immigration  Judge  makes  clear  his  evaluation  of  the
    evidence and explains his findings of fact:

        "10.     The ECO in the refusal took issue with the appellant  over
              his proposals for employment.  The appellant in his  original
              application  said  that  he  was  applying  for   a   working
              holidaymaker visa and intended to stay in the UK for  one-two
              years.  The ECO in the refusal referred to a job offer  which
              the appellant had where he was to be employed on a  part-time
              basis as a general assistant working fifteen hours per  week.
              I could not find confirmation of this offer in the bundle  of
              documents presented to me.  Nevertheless the appellant in the
              grounds of appeal only dealt with this issue  tangentially  -
              that he was aware of  the  requirement  of  being  a  working
              holidaymaker.  There was no direct  challenge  to  the  ECO's
              conclusion that the appellant's intention was to  work  part-
              time for the  full  period  of  two  years.   That  remark  I
              considered was a serious defect in the evidence presented  to
              the ECO.  It went to demonstrate that  the  appellant  was  a
              person  who  was  prepared  to  work   within   the   working
              holidaymaker framework for the whole period.


          11. What was equally significant I considered was the evidence to
              be found in the appellant's statement.  Here in  paragraph  7
              he said that his cousin had managed to secure a part-time job
              for him as a general assistant.  In paragraph 9 he  said  his
              motive was to see his cousin, sister and family and  to  work
              part-time and also visit the fascinating  sights  around  the
              country.   But  he  added  in  paragraph  10  that  the   ECO
              questioned his intentions to work part-time  during  his  two
              year's stay.  The appellant went on:


                  "I only intend to work part-time so I will get  money  to
                  cover my expenses and will not be a burden on anyone.   I
                  will not work full-time because I wish to benefit from my
                  working holiday by seeing sights, meeting new people  and
                  tasting the UK culture and lifestyle".


              These remarks I consider are significant.  They are  made  to
              emphasise that he will not work  full  time  -  not  that  he
              acknowledges he will take work incidental to the holiday.   I
              consider  this  remark  seriously  damages  the   appellant's
              motives  to  work  within  the  spirit  of  the  WHM  scheme.
              Paragraph (vi) makes it clear that the appellant must  intend
              to take employment incidental  to  his  holiday  and  not  to
              engage in business... and in any event not to work  for  more
              than twelve months during his stay.  I  looked  in  vain  for
              evidence from this appellant that he understood that this was
              a core feature of the application.  There was no evidence  to
              be found that the appellant understood and acknowledged  that
              he was not going to work for more than twelve  months.   That
              issue I considered was fatally damaging  to  the  success  of
              this appeal.




        12.      I heard evidence from the appellant's sponsor who I  found
              a  wholly  credible  and  reliable  witness  so  far  as  his
              commitments to sponsorship was concerned.  He  said  that  he
              would host  the  appellant  at  20  Langmore  House.   I  was
              satisfied on the evidence that when he said he  was  prepared
              to sponsor the appellant he would be able to do that.  On the
              other hand he acknowledged that his income was  as  shown  in
              payslips on the file.  He was employed at Thistle Hotels Ltd.
               His income I calculated to be in the order of �165  net  per
              week.  Gross pay amounted to about �9,700.  He gave  evidence
              to say that he was in receipt of state benefits, he  had  tax
              credits and child tax  credits.   He  had  child  benefit  in
              respect of his two children.  Whilst he had savings his  bank
              statements were not produced for my scrutiny.  At the date of
              decision I  considered  there  was  a  sum  of  about  �5,420
              outstanding to the account's credit.  That was  a  reasonable
              sum for savings.  There was no evidence to say  that  any  of
              the other family members were  working.   The  sponsor  lived
              with his wife and two  small  children  and  his  father.   I
              considered the sponsor's income together with the  sums  that
              were in credit in his bank account at the  date  of  decision
              were tight.  He conceded that at the end of twelve months  if
              the appellant was not able to work he may well  return  home.
              He would do his best  to  make  sure  that  he  was  properly
              provided for.  I believed him when he said this.  But  I  was
              not persuaded to the civil standard that there was sufficient
              funding available to this appellant for his two-year stay  if
              he was restricted to twelve months part-time  working  as  he
              must be at the end of twelve months I  considered  the  money
              would not be available for him.


              [There is no paragraph 13]


        14.      For these reasons I am not satisfied  that  the  appellant
              has met the requirements of paragraph (v)  and  (vi).   I  am
              satisfied that there was fully adequate accommodation for the
              appellant and  his  sponsor.   There  were  doubts  that  the
              appellant had the means to  pay  for  his  return  or  onward
              journey and consequential doubts that the appellant  intended
              to leave the UK at the end of his working holiday."


 7. At the hearing before us at Field House on 19 June 2007 Mr  Burrett  of
    Counsel produced the relevant  Immigration  Directorate's  Instructions
    (IDIs).  In drawing to our attention paragraph 10  of  the  Immigration
    Judge's determination, he invited us to note  the  Immigration  Judge's
    finding that the evidence demonstrated that "the appellant was a person
    who was prepared to work within the working holidaymaker framework  for
    the whole period".  It was the appellant's intention to work on a part-
    time basis in order  to  earn  funds  to  sightsee  within  the  United
    Kingdom.  Mr Burrett emphasised that "incidental" was at the very heart
    of the Immigration Rule and as  such  should  be  given  priority  when
    focusing on whether or not the appellant had met  the  requirements  of
    the rule.  The appellant had established that he intended to spend more
    time holidaying than working and that by working he hoped to  fund  his
    stay.  There was no intention whatsoever to work more than 15  hours  a
    week, significantly less than full-time employment.  It  was  therefore
    clear that  his  intentions  with  regard  to  employment  were  to  be
    incidental to his holidaymaking.  Mr Khan on behalf of  the  respondent
    reminded us of what the appellant had said in his witness statement  on
    the basis of which the Immigration Judge had concluded that  there  was
    no evidence "to be found that the appellant understood and acknowledged
    that he was not going to work  for  more  than  12  months."   Mr  Khan
    submitted  that  the  conclusion  drawn  from  the  evidence   by   the
    Immigration Judge that the fact that the  appellant  intended  to  work
    over the whole two year period was fatally damaging to the appeal.   He
    submitted that there was indeed no error of law.  In acknowledging that
    the 12 months' work could be split in any way in that it did  not  need
    to be consecutive periods of work, he  urged  us  to  accept  that  the
    Immigration Rule specified with clarity that the overall time spent  in
    work could not exceed 12 months.

 8. Mr Burrett invited us to conclude  that  interpreting  the  Immigration
    Rule to mean that one could not work in whatever pattern  of  work  one
    chose but in any event for no more than 12 months  over  the  two  year
    period was absurd.  For example if an appellant were to work  one  hour
    per week over the two year period, he would not meet  the  requirements
    of  the  rule  although  he  would  de  facto  be  in  employment   for
    considerably less than others who might well satisfy  the  requirements
    of the rule.

 9. At the heart of this appeal is the construction of  the  provision  set
    out in paragraph 95(vi) - "and in any event not to work for  more  than
    12 months during his stay".  The IDIs at paragraph  2.2  thereof  under
    the heading of "Work Incidental to a Working Holiday" provide that:-

        "Working holidaymakers are expected to intend to take work  in  the
        United Kingdom as an incidental  part  of  their  working  holiday.
        Those wishing to enter in the category should treat the  work  that
        they do as a purely incidental part of their holiday (which  should
        be their primary reason for  being  here)  rather  than  being  the
        reason for which they have sought  entry  to  the  United  Kingdom.
        Accordingly, working holidaymakers must not intend  to  spend  more
        than 12 months of their stay in  employment,  and  must  intend  to
        spend the rest of their stay holidaying. ... However, they may  not
        engage  in  business  or  provide  services   as   a   professional
        sportsperson, and they may only engage in work for a maximum period
        of 12 months in total throughout their stay.  They may choose  when
        to work and when to take their holiday breaks  as  they  wish,  but
        those who exceed the maximum 12 month period of work permitted will
        be in breach of their conditions."

10. We were referred  to  AG  (Working  holidaymaker:  'incidental')  India
    [2007] UKAIT  00033.   Here  there  was  a  different  question  to  be
    answered: did the reference to "12 months" in the rule entitle  someone
    who was only staying that long in this country to work the whole  time?
    The answer was no,  despite  a  concession  to  that  effect  from  the
    presenting officer, because (to quote the judicial head-note in full:

        "The word 'incidental' in paragraph 95(vi) of HC 395 means what  it
        says, and embodies a requirement of the Rules.   The  Secretary  of
        State may grant leave to enter outside the Rules,  but  it  is  not
        open to the Secretary of State to purport to adopt a meaning of the
        Rules that is contrary to their clear words."


11. Mr Burrett's argument was based not on the plain words of the rule, but
    on what he urged us to  regard  as  its  sensible  meaning.   While  we
    recognise that the Rules are not to be construed like  a  statute,  the
    purpose of this one, if not clear already, was in our view  made  clear
    in AG.

12. While Mr Burrett argued that working part-time for the whole of  a  24-
    month visit might amount to no more than 12 months at work,  we  cannot
    accept that this agrees with the purpose of  the  rule.   First,  in  a
    working holiday which depended on being able to work part-time for  the
    whole of one's stay, one's employment could not sensibly  be  described
    as "incidental to the holiday".  What is more,  the  draftsman  of  the
    proviso has chosen to express the period allowed in any event in  terms
    of months, and we have no doubt that was  deliberate.   Decision-makers
    are not required to add up each day to be worked to see if the total is
    likely to reach 12 months' work during  the  visit  as  a  whole:  they
    cannot have been expected to form their own rules, without any  further
    guidance, as to what a working month, or even week was to be.  All they
    need to do is to decide whether a would-be  working  holidaymaker  will
    need to work for any part of a period (or  periods,  in  line  with  Mr
    Khan's concession) exceeding 12 calendar months during his whole  stay.
    If so,  then  following  AG,  his  employment  cannot  be  regarded  as
    "incidental to the holiday", and the application must  fail  under  the
    rule.

13. It is clear to us that sub-paragraph (vi) of  paragraph  95  should  be
    given its ordinary meaning.  The  correct  interpretation  is  that  an
    applicant is not entitled to entry clearance unless  he  is  "intending
    only to take employment incidental to a holiday" and the reference  "12
    months" at the end of the sub-paragraph is significantly  in  our  view
    preceded by the words "in any event".  There can be no doubt  it  seems
    to us that the primary requirement  is  that  the  employment  will  be
    incidental to the holiday and that any period of  employment  will  not
    exceed 12 months in total.

14. The Immigration Judge found no evidence that the appellant  "understood
    and acknowledged that he was not going to work for  more  than  the  12
    months.  That issue I considered was fatally damaging to the success of
    this appeal".

15. We agree entirely with the conclusion reached by the Immigration Judge.
     Accordingly, the Immigration Judge made no error of law in  dismissing
    the appeal and we order that the determination stands.

16.   The appeal is dismissed.
