      Representation:

      For the Appellant: Mr T Hussain, instructed by Kabir Ahmed & Co
Solicitors
      For the Respondent: Mrs R Pettersen, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. 1. The appellant, Hina Sehar Khan, was born on 6 March 1982  and  is  a
    female citizen of Pakistan.  The appellant  had  appealed  against  the
    decision of the respondent dated 28 May 2012 to  refuse  her  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom on the basis that to remove her  from  the
    United Kingdom would not breach Article 8  ECHR.   Her  appeal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Sarsfield) was dismissed in a  determination
    promulgated  on  1  August  2012.   The  appellant  now  appeals,  with
    permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant suffers from rheumatoid  arthritis  and  self-administers
    weekly injections.  She first came to the United Kingdom as  a  student
    in October 2003.  Her leave was extended until December  2008  when  it
    expired.  An application for further leave to remain as a  student  was
    made in early 2009 but that application  was  refused.   The  appellant
    continued to study in the United  Kingdom  until  June  2009  and  then
    withdrew from her studies because of her medical  condition.   She  was
    served with a notice of her liability to  be  removed  on  7  September
    2009.  She went through an Islamic  marriage  on  2  October  2010  and
    subsequently contracted a civil marriage with her husband on  26  March
    2012.  She now seeks to remain in the United Kingdom  and  prevent  her
    removal to Pakistan on the basis of her family and private life in this
    country.

 3. I find that Judge Sarsfield's determination should  be  set  aside  for
    legal error.  Paragraphs 11-18 of the determination (which is  only  22
    paragraphs long) are what may be referred to as  "standard  paragraphs"
    setting out familiar jurisprudence but making little, if  any,  attempt
    to apply that jurisprudence to the facts which the judge had found.  It
    is asserted that the judge made errors of fact in the findings  at  [9]
    and, whilst many of the findings and  observations  may  be  valid  and
    based on the evidence that had been before  the  Tribunal,  the  actual
    analysis of the Article 8 ECHR appeal appears  to  consist  of  nothing
    more than what the judge says at [19]:

         "In addition to my above findings,  the  appellant  has  known  her
         situation was precarious for some time.  Her  mother  could  return
         with her to assist in Pakistan and her husband has agreed  that  he
         would go there if she returned.  I find it would be reasonable  for
         her husband to go to Pakistan with the appellant.  If not, she  can
         return and apply for a visa to re-enter the UK as any separation is
         unlikely to be long-term.  I am aware that spouse visa applications
         are dealt with expeditiously in Pakistan - 88% in 40 days and  100%
         in 60 days, so any separation could be of limited nature.   Contact
         with those in the UK can remain in the meantime."

 4. Not only is that attempt to apply the law to the facts  in  the  appeal
    brusque, it is also confused.  Where the judge finds that "her  husband
    has agreed that he would go there if she returned.  I find it would  be
    reasonable for the husband to go to Pakistan with  the  appellant"  the
    judge appears to have proceeded to reach his findings on basis of facts
    which was entirely contrary to what he had been told in oral  evidence.
    At paragraph 5, the judge recorded that  the  appellant's  husband  (Mr
    Daniel Butterworth) had told the Tribunal that  he  could  "not  go  to
    Pakistan as he did not know the language, would  not  get  a  job,  was
    employed as a care assistant and had his family in the UK.  Even if  it
    was to be on a short-term basis, he could not  get  sufficient  leave."
    The judge went on to record that, "If the appellant went to Pakistan to
    apply for entry, [Mr Butterworth] would support her.  Even  though  the
    choice was to go with his wife to Pakistan or let her return alone,  he
    would not let her go alone."

 5. At [5],  the judge recorded Mr Butterworth as having said that  he  was
    not prepared to live permanently in Pakistan with his wife but would be
    prepared, if absolutely necessary, to return with her whilst  she  made
    an application for entry clearance.  It is not at all clear whether the
    judge's finding quoted at [4]  above  refers  only  to  Mr  Butterworth
    returning permanently with the appellant to Pakistan to continue family
    life  there  or  a  temporary  visit  whilst  the  appellant  makes  an
    application for entry clearance.  I find the confusion surrounding that
    finding alone is sufficient to render the determination unsatisfactory.
     The judge needed to  make  an  objective  finding  based  on  all  the
    relevant evidence (i.e. not simply following what  Mr  Butterworth  had
    told him in evidence) as to whether  it  would  be  reasonable  for  Mr
    Butterworth  and  the  appellant  to  return  permanently  to  live  in
    Pakistan.  Such a finding would have disposed of the Article  8  appeal
    without further consideration.  If, on the other hand,  the  judge  was
    referring  only  to  temporary  return  to  Pakistan  whilst  an  entry
    clearance application is made, then  I  agree  with  Mr  Hussain  that,
    notwithstanding the fact that he has referred to Chikwamba at [18],  he
    has not properly engaged with that authority or  sought  to  apply  its
    principles to the facts as he had found them in this case.  Mr  Hussain
    also told me that if the appellant made an application out  of  country
    for entry clearance, the United Kingdom sponsor would  be  required  to
    earn no less than ï¿½18,600.  Mr Butterworth does not earn that much  and
    an application for entry clearance at the present time would be certain
    to fail.

 6. Judge Sarsfield has failed to make any proper  findings  regarding  the
    appellant's immigration history and how this may affect the application
    of Chikwamba (see, in particular, [42] of Chikwamba).  He has not taken
    any account of the likely outcome of an application for entry clearance
    succeeding.  These are issues which the First-tier Tribunal should have
    considered but  failed  to  consider  in  dismissing  the  appeal.  The
    reasoning of the First-tier Tribunal is neither adequate nor cogent.

 7. I set aside the determination of the First-tier Tribunal.   Further,  I
    consider that this is an  appropriate  case  to  be  remitted  to  that
    Tribunal (not Judge Sarsfield) to make fresh findings of facts  and  to
    apply  the  relevant  jurisprudence  (including  Chikwamba)  to   those
    findings.

DECISION

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal  which  was  promulgated  on  1
August 2012 is  set  aside.   The  appeal  is  remitted  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal to remake the decision.
