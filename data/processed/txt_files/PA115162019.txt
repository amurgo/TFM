For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Iraq born  in  1983.   He  appeals  with
    permission against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (Designated
    Judge McClure) to dismiss his appeal on  protection  and  human  rights
    grounds.

 2.  The  Appellant's  case  was   that   he   faced   a   real   risk   of
    persecution/serious harm in Iraq for reasons of his  imputed  political
    opinion  (anti-ISIS),  and/or  ethnicity  (Kurdish)  and  or  religious
    identity (Sunni). He submitted that his home town of  Makhmour  was  in
    contested  territory  and  that   having   regard   to   his   personal
    characteristics it would not be reasonable to expect  him  to  relocate
    within Iraq to avoid the fighting and/or risk of harm pertaining there.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal did not accept the Appellant's account  of  why
    he had left Iraq. The Tribunal  made  significant  adverse  credibility
    findings, in particular rejecting the Appellant's claim to have faced a
    threat from ISIS and/or the Shi'ia militias who drove  them  out.   The
    Appellant has not sought to challenge those findings  and  in  granting
    permission to appeal to this Tribunal, Designated Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Shaerf described those findings as both far reaching  and
    sustainable. That is a  description  that  I  respectfully  adopt.  The
    credibility  findings  made  by  Judge  McClure  are  preserved.    The
    Appellant is not entitled to protection under the Refugee Convention.

 4. This appeal is concerned with whether  the  Appellant  is  nevertheless
    entitled to subsidiary or humanitarian protection under  Article  15(b)
    of the Qualification Directive[1]. The Appellant relies upon the  Upper
    Tribunal's  decision  in  SMO  and  Others  (Article  15(c):   identity
    documents) Iraq CG [2019] UKUT 400 (IAC) to submit that there is a real
    risk that as an undocumented returnee he would  fall  into  destitution
    such  that  would  place  the  United  Kingdom  in  violation  of   its
    obligations under Article 3 ECHR / Article 15(b) QD.  He  submits  that
    in its evaluation of that submission the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in
    law. He asks this Tribunal  to  set  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on that matter  aside,  and  replace  its  decision  with  one
    allowing the appeal on protection (humanitarian protection) grounds.

    Error of Law: Discussion and Findings

 5. The pertinent findings of the First-tier Tribunal were as follows:

      i) Since the Appellant re-entered Iraq (from Norway in  2008)  without
         difficulty it could be assumed that he could do so again.  He  will
         know the details necessary to obtain  new  documentation  from  the
         embassy here [FTT �46];

     ii) He has previously said that his documentation  was  left  at  home.
         There is no reason why he could not  contact  a  family  member  to
         retrieve it for him [�47].

 6. The Appellant submits that in respect of finding (i) above  the  First-
    tier Tribunal has failed to have regard to the  actual  evidence  about
    how CSID cards might be obtained from the embassy in London. Across  at
    least three country guidance  cases[2]  Dr  Fatah  has  given  detailed
    evidence that although it remains possible to obtain documentation from
    the embassy here, the reasonable likelihood of someone being unable  to
    do so must be evaluated in light of the multiple  obstructions  to  the
    operation of good administration on the part of the Iraqi  authorities:
    the de-Ba'athification of the civil service,  corruption,  inefficiency
    and that in the context of many millions  of  undocumented  Iraqis  the
    problems of individual returnees are seen as "trivial".

 7. In respect of the Appellant's return to  Iraq  in  2008  the  Appellant
    questions how relevant that is - the Respondent  produced  no  evidence
    one way or another as to how his return was facilitated.

 8. Finally, it is submitted that the First-tier Tribunal appears  to  have
    overlooked the fact that the Appellant has epilepsy,  which  he  claims
    interferes with his ability to recall information accurately.  Although
    the Tribunal in SMO found that most Iraqis will be able to  recall  the
    details in the 'family book' the ability of the  Appellant  had  to  be
    assessed in light of this illness.

 9. As I suggested to Ms Thomas during the hearing,  all  of  these  points
    might be arguable were the Appellant being returned to Baghdad. That is
    not however the position.   It does not appear to  have  ever  been  in
    issue that the Appellant is from a village near Makhmour.  Makhmour  is
    in the Erbil governate.  It is about one hour's drive south-west of the
    Kurdish capital, which is where the Appellant will be returned to:  see
    FTT �44.  That being the case, the findings in SMO about  for  instance
    subsisting in Baghdad, or travel from Baghdad airport to the north, are
    wholly irrelevant. This Appellant will be flying back direct  into  the
    IKR from where he can take a bus or taxi back to his home town  through
    territory that remains "virtually violence free", unmolested  by  Sh'ia
    militiamen.  Once there he can attend  the  civil  registry  in  person
    where his biometrics and/or  family  connections  will  enable  him  to
    obtain new documentation without difficulty.

10. In response to my suggestion Ms Thomas indicated that she had not  been
    prepared to argue this point. She had been working on the premise  that
    in order to be returned to Iraq the  Appellant  would  need  to  be  in
    possession  of  a  CSID,  and  her  submissions  largely  went  to  the
    likelihood of the same being issued in London. I therefore shortly  set
    the matter back in the list in order that Ms Thomas could see if  there
    was any other finding in SMO that might assist her.

11. Upon resumption Ms Thomas was able to point me to paras 192 and 193  of
    SMO. I am afraid these do not assist, concerned as they  are  with  the
    documentation returnees  require  for  onward  travel  once  they  have
    departed Baghdad airport. As I have said,  that  is  not  the  position
    here.

12. Whilst Ms Thomas may be forgiven for her misapprehension  in  light  of
    paragraph 44 of the First-tier Tribunal decision, it remains  the  case
    that applying SMO, what the Appellant needs to get on a plane  to  Iraq
    is a passport, or a laissez-passer. What information might be needed to
    secure the latter is not a matter that concerns me. It is a matter that
    must be resolved between the Appellant, the Iraqi authorities  and  the
    Respondent.  If  the  document  cannot  be  obtained  then  that  is  a
    "technical obstacle to return" of the sort considered by the  Court  of
    Appeal in HH (Somalia) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2010] EWCA Civ 426 [at �84] to fall outwith the scope of my protection
    enquiry.  It follows that no material error of law can  be  established
    in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and the decision must stand.




    Anonymity Order

13. This appeal concerns a claim for protection.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decision and Directions

14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is upheld  and  the  appeal  is
    dismissed.

15. There is an order for anonymity.
