                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS







      Introduction


      1.    The Appellant (the Secretary of State) appealed with  permission
           granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Ford  on  9  October  2014
           against the determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Maxwell
           who had allowed  the  Respondent's  appeal  in  a  determination
           promulgated on 3 September 2014.


      2.    The Respondent is a national of India, born on 6  October  1986,
           who had applied on 6 January 2014 for further leave to enter the
           United Kingdom as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant.  The  Respondent's
           existing leave in that category had  been  curtailed  so  as  to
           expire on 7 January 2014.   The latest application  was  refused
           by the Secretary of State on 20 January 2014.  The  refusal  was
           stated to be because the Respondent's Certificate of Sponsorship
           stated her annual salary as �22,000.00 for  a  39  hour  working
           week which equated to �21,153.85 for  a  37.5  hour  week.   The
           minimum  acceptable  salary  for  occupation  code  2231  Nurses
           (Appendix J of the Immigration Rules) was �21,176.00.  The judge
           found that there was no error by the  Respondent's  employer  in
           the Certificate of Sponsorship, however the  judge  went  on  to
           find that the difference of �22.15 per year was de mimimis.  The
           judge referred to [21] of Miah and ors v SSHD  [2012]  EWCA  Civ
           261 and allowed the appeal on the  basis  that  there  had  been
           substantial compliance by the Respondent  with  the  Immigration
           Rules.


      3.    Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted by First-
           tier Tribunal Ford because she considered that it  was  arguable
           that the judge  had  fallen  into  error  because  the  relevant
           Immigration Rule was clear and had not been met.


      4.    Standard directions were made.




      Submissions - error of law


      5.    Ms Sreeraman for the Appellant relied  on  the  application  for
           permission to appeal and grant of permission  to  appeal.   Miah
           (above) explained at [25] and [26] that there was no "near miss"
           principle.  The Respondent had a remedy because she could make a
           fresh variation of leave application: there was a 28 day  window
           available to her.


      6.    Mr Panikkar for the Respondent submitted that the judge had been
           entitled to reach his decision.  It  was  a  minimal  shortfall.
           There was no alternative remedy as the category of leave was  no
           longer open, as from September 2014.  The Respondent  would  now
           have to pass an Observed Structured Clinical Examination.




      No material error of law finding


      7.    The tribunal reserved its determination which now follows.


      8.    The First-tier Tribunal Judge's determination is  succinct.   It
           was not disputed, here and below, that  the  relevant  authority
           was Miah (above).  The judge was careful to draw  a  distinction
           between a "near miss" and de minimis, citing  [21]  of  Miah  in
           support of his conclusion.  As the judge pointed out,  Miah  was
           particularly  relevant  because  the  Court   of   Appeal   were
           considering an application made within  Tier  2  of  the  Points
           Based System.  To indicate why he considered that the de minimis
           principle applied, the judge showed that the shortfall from  the
           appropriate salary was 1p per hour, per 5 day working week.   On
           that basis the judge found that the Immigration  Rule  had  been
           met.


      9.    No further authority was cited by either party  to  the  appeal.
           In  the  tribunal's  view  the  judge's  decision  was  properly
           reasoned and his conclusion was correct.   He  found,  properly,
           that the Respondent's application was a not a "near  miss",  but
           rather an utterly trivial shortfall.  No doubt in reaching  that
           conclusion the judge had taken into account the  fact  that  the
           Respondent had been in the United Kingdom  lawfully  since  2008
           and that her application had been an obviously meritorious one.


      10.   The possibility that there was an alternative remedy open to the
           Respondent does not appear to have been argued before the  judge
           by  the  Secretary  of  State.   It  is  not  mentioned  in  the
           determination.  Thus it is not appropriate for the  tribunal  to
           consider the point, particularly as it is far from  clear,  with
           the constant changes made to the Immigration Rules and  guidance
           that such a remedy exists.


      11.   Accordingly, the tribunal finds that there was no error  of  law
           in the determination and there is no basis for interfering  with
           the judge's decision.
