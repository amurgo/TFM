                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Entry Clearance Officer against the  decision
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Napthine  promulgated  12.12.14,  allowing
    under Article 8 ECHR the claimant's appeal against the decision of  the
    Entry Clearance Officer, dated 23.4.14, to refuse her application  made
    on 17.4.14 for entry clearance to  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  general
    visitor pursuant to paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules.   The  Judge
    heard the appeal on 27.11.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Pirotta  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    11.2.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 8.4.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out below I find that there was an error of law  in
    the making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  such  that  the
    determination of Judge Napthine should be set aside.

 5. The application was refused because the Entry Clearance Officer was not
    satisfied that the claimant was a genuine visitor who intended to leave
    the UK on the conclusion of her visit. The claimant was served  with  a
    notice of limited rights of appeal.

 6. Judge Napthine made findings that the  claimant  and  her  husband  the
    sponsor were separated and she wanted to visit him in the UK to  decide
    whether to establish their family life in the UK or Nigeria, where  she
    has two daughters, the younger of which is the child  of  the  sponsor.
    The claimant has a business in Nigeria, established with funds provided
    by the sponsor, who visits his family in Nigeria twice a year.

 7. The judge found that the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer was  a
    clear breach of the claimant's and the sponsor's  rights  to  a  family
    life and was "excessive and unreasonable."

 8. The grounds of application for permission to  appeal  assert  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge failed to recognise that  the  ambit  of  the
    appeal was limited  by  section  84(1)(b)  &  (c)  of  the  Nationality
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. The grounds further complain that  the
    judge failed to take into account the existing pattern of  private  and
    family life in Nigeria, which did not exist in the UK. It is  submitted
    that the proportionality assessment  is  entirely  inadequate,  as  the
    decision  failed  to  explain  why  it  would  be  a   disproportionate
    interference with Article 8 to refuse a temporary visit to the  UK.  It
    remained open to the sponsor to  continue  to  visit  the  claimant  in
    Nigeria, or a third country.

 9. It is clear that the judge  confused  an  assessment  under  Article  8
    private and family life with an assessment as to whether the  appellant
    met the requirements of the Immigration Rules, even though there is  no
    right of appeal  against  the  decision  on  immigration  grounds.  For
    example, the judge went through the various requirements  of  paragraph
    41, finding at �25 that the claimant could meet them and "therefore the
    refusal of her application was a clear breach of her and the  sponsor's
    rights to a  family  life  and  that  interference  was  excessive  and
    unreasonable."

10. The decision appears to recognise at �25 that the only effective ground
    of appeal is under Article 8 ECHR, but the judge appears to have relied
    on a finding that the claimant met the requirements  of  the  Rules  in
    order to reach a conclusion that the decision was in breach of  Article
    8 ECHR. As held in Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance)  [2015]  UKUT
    112 (IAC), "in the case of appeals brought  against  refusal  of  entry
    clearance under Article 8 ECHR the claimant's ability  to  satisfy  the
    Immigration Rules is not the question to be determined by  a  Tribunal,
    but is capable of being a weighty,  though  not  determinative,  factor
    when deciding whether such refusal is proportionate to  the  legitimate
    aim of enforcing immigration control."

11.  At  �26  the  judge  went  further,  finding  that  the  claimant  had
    "discharged the burden of proof and the reasons given by the respondent
    do not justify the refusal. Therefore the respondent's decision is  not
    in accordance with the law." Those statements are in error of  law.  If
    the judge took the view that the decision was not  in  accordance  with
    the law the correct course would be to allow the appeal to the  limited
    extent that the decision was not in accordance  with  the  law  and  it
    remains  for  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to  make  a  decision  in
    accordance with the law.

12. Further, the Article 8 assessment, such as one  can  be  detected,  was
    flawed. There was no reference  to  proportionality  in  the  decision.
    There was no consideration of the fact that such family life as existed
    between the sponsor and the claimant  could  continue  by  the  regular
    visits of the sponsor to Nigeria. The  claimant  and  the  sponsor  had
    chosen to live separate lives, with the claimant  in  Nigeria  and  the
    sponsor choosing to remain in the UK, even though he has a wife and  at
    least one child between them in Nigeria. The refusal of the visit  visa
    did not prevent that level of family life continuing. Paragraph  41  is
    not a route to settlement and is intended only  to  provide  for  short
    family visits to the UK. It remained open to the  claimant  to  make  a
    fresh application  for  such  a  visit,  taking  care  to  address  the
    substantive reasons for  refusal.  There  are  also  other  routes  for
    settlement  to  the  UK,  which  are  open  to  the  claimant.  In  the
    circumstances, the refusal decision cannot amount to a disproportionate
    interference to such family life as exists.

13. In the circumstances, I set the decision aside and proceeded to  remake
    it.

14. Mr Adetunji explained that it was a deliberate  decision  to  keep  his
    wife and the children in Nigeria.  He  wanted  them  to  be  raised  in
    Nigeria. He would continue to visit regularly, but as he was  in  full-
    time employment he had only 4 weeks leave a year. He wanted his wife to
    be able to visit him in the UK from time to time. He had chosen not  to
    make a settlement application, but believed that he would qualify under
    Appendix FM. He also recognised that his  wife  could  make  a  further
    visit  visa  application,  taking  care  to  ensure  that  satisfactory
    evidence is submitted with the appellant. He insisted that the decision
    was in breach of his human rights.

15. However, applying the Razgar stepped approach, I am not satisfied  that
    the decision to refuse the visit  visa  application  is  such  a  grave
    interference with the Article 8 family rights so as to engage Article 8
    at all. The status quo of the appellant in Nigeria and the  sponsor  in
    the UK is the family life that they have chosen for themselves. He  can
    continue to visit them in Nigeria. Even if Article 8 is engaged, having
    regard to the public interest considerations under section 117B of  the
    2002 Act, in which immigration control is in  the  public  interest,  I
    find that in the proportionality balancing exercise between on the  one
    hand the rights of the appellant and the sponsor and on the  other  the
    legitimate and necessary public interest  in  protecting  the  economic
    well-being of the UK through immigration  control,  the  balance  comes
    firmly down in favour of  the  decision  being  proportionate  and  not
    disproportionate to those rights. In reaching that conclusion I bear in
    mind that the family life status quo chosen by the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor continues. He can continue to visit his family in  Nigeria.  It
    is open to her to make a fresh application for a  visit  visa,  or  for
    them to make an application for settlement. In those  circumstances,  I
    fail to see how the decision could ever be regarded as disproportionate
    to the actual family life enjoyed by the appellant and the sponsor. She
    is not being prevented indefinitely from visiting the  sponsor  in  the
    UK. Further, given that there has been no  challenge  to  the  positive
    factual findings in the decision of Judge Napthine, the appellant  will
    be able to rely on those in any further application, perhaps  enclosing
    copies of that decision and this decision.

Conclusions:

16. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside and remade.

                           I set aside the decision.

                            I  re-make  the  decision  in  the  appeal   by
                      dismissing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
