Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms S Panagiotopoulou, Counsel instructed by A H
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant in this case is a Turkish national, born on 1 April 1993.
     He entered the UK clandestinely in January 2013.  On 27 June  2014  he
    married a Lithuanian national, [Z M].  He had, prior to  the  marriage,
    on 6 June 2014 applied for a residence card as a family  member  of  an
    EEA national.  The respondent refused the appellant's application on 18
    November 2014, following a visit to the appellant's home by immigration
    officers.  The respondent considered  that  the  marriage  was  one  of
    convenience.

 2. The appellant appealed and his case came before Judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal Isaacs on 19 October 2015.  In a decision  promulgated  on  29
    October 2015 Judge Isaacs dismissed the appellant's appeal against  the
    decision to refuse to issue a residence card.  She dismissed it on  the
    basis that she found the marriage to be one of convenience.

 3. The appellant appealed to the Upper  Tribunal  on  a  large  number  of
    grounds.  The decision of the judge granting permission considered that
    these grounds were arguable.

Decision on Error of Law

 4. The appeal came  before  me.   Ms  Panagiotopoulou  accepted  that  the
    grounds amounted to a disagreement with the findings of the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge but submitted that cumulatively the effect of  them  was
    to render the decision  unsafe.   She  also  noted  that  it  had  been
    accepted in the grounds of  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  that  the
    evidence of the appellant was unsatisfactory.

 5. For the reasons set out below I do not find  there  to  be  a  material
    error of law; even when taken cumulatively the grounds  for  permission
    to appeal amount to a number of disagreements with the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal rather than identifying any material error of  law.
    The judge set out her findings in some  considerable  detail  including
    carefully considering all the aspects of the application including  the
    early  relationship  from  April  to   October   2013,   the   wedding,
    cohabitation, the sponsor's employment and credibility in general.  She
    made cogent, adequate findings (including findings  not  challenged  in
    either the grounds for permission to appeal or  otherwise)  which  were
    open to her on the evidence.

Grounds 1 and 2

 6. Ms Panagiotopoulou identified this to  relate  to  the  judge's  stated
    failure to consider the evidence  of  all  the  witnesses  and  it  was
    submitted there was a failure to have regard to relevant  evidence.   I
    do not regard this ground as being made out.  In  a  detailed  decision
    Judge Isaacs set out  at  paragraph  [10]  that  she  heard  from  five
    witnesses, the appellant, his wife Zydrune Misiunaite, Valentina  Pukin
    the wife of the appellant's cousin Ali Celik,  Ali  Celik  and  Jessica
    Celik the wife of the appellant's cousin Abdulla Celik.  The judge went
    on in her decision and reasons to set out  the  oral  evidence  of  the
    appellant, the sponsor and Valentina Pukin.  She stated  at  [43]  that
    the oral evidence of the other witnesses was set out in the  Record  of
    Proceedings.

 7. The fact that the judge chose not to separately set out the evidence of
    the final two witnesses is not an error and the judge made reference to
    the evidence of all the witnesses throughout her decision and  reasons.
    Although  emphasis  was  placed,  both  in  the  grounds  and  in  oral
    submissions, upon the alleged failure to make any specific reference to
    the oral evidence of Jessica Celik and why this evidence was  rejected,
    this is implicit in the findings of the judge.  At [69] the judge found
    that the marriage was one of convenience and the judge stated that  she
    believed that the appellant "together with Zydrune Misiunaite,  Mr  Ali
    Celik and Ms Valentina Pukin collaborated to put together a false paper
    trail and narrative in order to try and substantiate  a  history  of  a
    genuine relationship and marriage".  This in my  view  encompasses  the
    evidence of all the witnesses, given that Mr Ali Celik was one  of  the
    witnesses whose evidence was not specifically recorded in the  decision
    and reasons.

 8. It is clear that  the  judge  carefully  considered  all  the  evidence
    including that of Jessica Celik's evidence as she  refers  at  [94]  to
    Jessica Celik giving evidence about the children of the sponsor and her
    prior relationship.  I note that Ms Jessica Celik had  submitted  joint
    witness statements  with  her  husband  Abdulla  Celik  confirming  the
    claimed relationship between the appellant and Ms  Misiunaite  and  the
    judge  gave  clear  reasons  for  rejecting  the  narrative   of   that
    relationship.  There was no error material or otherwise in the  judge's
    approach to the evidence of the witnesses.

 9. It was not the case that she  failed  to  adequately  engage  with  the
    possibility that whilst the appellant  himself  may  be  an  unreliable
    witness this may not necessarily go to the credibility of the claim  as
    a whole.  The  judge  set  out  numerous  examples  of  inconsistencies
    including between the appellant's evidence, that  of  the  sponsor  and
    that of Mr Ali Celik and Ms Valentina Pukin.  The fact  that  they  may
    have been some internal consistencies between the evidence of  some  of
    the witnesses does not detract from her overall findings,  particularly
    given that the judge found that this was a sophisticated  collaboration
    to  put  together  a  false  paper  trail  and  narrative  to  try   to
    substantiate a claim of  a  genuine  relationship  and  marriage.   The
    judge, at paragraph [69], set out that there were:

         "numerous  inconsistencies  between  witnesses  and   incongruities
         between the witnesses' accounts and the  documentary  evidence.   I
         set out only the most  salient  of  these  below,  but  these  were
         sufficient for me to conclude that the marriage is not genuine".

10. In addition, neither the grounds of appeal  nor  the  oral  submissions
    before me identifies any specific evidence  that  the  judge  allegedly
    failed to have regard to from any of the witnesses.

Ground 3

11. The grounds for permission to appeal objected to the  judge's  findings
    at paragraph [70] in relation to the appellant's level of English.  The
    judge noted that the appellant and the sponsor met  at  a  party  three
    months after the appellant  arrived  illegally  in  the  UK  and  that:
    "neither of them spoke English well enough to communicate in  even  the
    most  casual  terms".   In  addition  the  judge  noted  that  in   her
    observations at the hearing it was clear to her that the appellant  did
    not  understand  English.   She  noted  that  the  appellant  did   not
    understand any English when she addressed him in very simple terms such
    as asking him if  he  understood  the  interpreter.   The  judge  noted
    however that the appellant claims that his English is much better  than
    when he first  met  the  sponsor  Ms  Misiunaite  and  in  his  witness
    statement he claims "I and my wife can understand each other very  well
    and have no problem communicating in English".  The  judge  found  this
    very unlikely and noted that in April 2013 the appellant's English,  on
    his own admission, was much weaker than it  was  at  the  date  of  the
    hearing and therefore the judge found it "highly  unlikely  that  these
    two people would have been able to communicate sufficiently to  develop
    any kind of meaningful relationship, let alone a romantic one  profound
    enough not to lead to a genuine engagement just eight months later".

12. The grounds for permission to appeal submitted  that  the  judge  erred
    because the appellant was using an interpreter throughout  the  hearing
    and it was unreasonable and unfair of the judge to  criticise  him  for
    any failure to respond to questions that may have been put  to  him  in
    English as it was submitted that presumably the  appellant  would  have
    been waiting for these questions to be  translated  and  instructed  to
    only respond to the questions in Turkish.

13. I am not persuaded that there is any material  error  in  this  ground.
    The judge was entitled to observe that the appellant did not understand
    any English when she addressed him in  simple  terms  at  the  hearing.
    However even if I am wrong and this was an error, I do not find  it  to
    be material.  In  the  first  instance  the  judge  made  adequate  and
    sustainable findings which can be separated from  her  observations  on
    the appellant's English,  that  the  appellant's  English  on  his  own
    admission was much weaker in April  2013  and  also  that  neither  the
    appellant or the sponsor spoke English well enough to communicate  even
    in the most casual terms  when  they  met.   Therefore  her  subsequent
    finding that it is highly unlikely that they would have been unable  to
    communicate  sufficiently  at  that  stage  to  develop  a   meaningful
    relationship, stands regardless of any arguable error  in  the  judge's
    observation of the appellant's English at the hearing.  In the  further
    alternative I am satisfied that the judge's detailed findings in  their
    entirety are detailed and cogent and could stand without this finding.

Grounds 4, 5 and 6

14. It was argued that the judge erroneously found that the sponsor Zydrune
    Misiunaite did not discuss her job  application  in  sufficient  detail
    with the appellant for him to realise that she was  talking  about  his
    relative's caf�.  It was submitted the fact that the appellant did  not
    know that the sponsor was employed by his relative is not an indication
    that they did not discuss her  employment.   I  note  that  no  further
    submissions were made on this ground in oral  evidence  other  than  to
    state that the judge failed to have regard to relevant evidence.

15. I do not find these grounds to be properly arguable.  The judge records
    at [73] that the appellant was vague about the order of  events  around
    when he discovered that the sponsor was an employee  of  his  relative.
    The judge notes that the appellant suggested at one  point  during  his
    evidence that he visited her work for the first  time  after  they  had
    moved in  together  and  it  was  then  that  he  realised  the  family
    connection.  The judge went on to note that she had a letter  from  the
    accountants working for Valentina Pukin which states that  the  sponsor
    Ms Misiunaite began working at the caf� on 1 October 2013.  It  was  Ms
    Misiunaite's account that the appellant discovered she was working  for
    Ali Celik's wife only by accident when the  appellant  visited  her  at
    work one day and he realised  the  allegedly  coincidental  connection.
    The judge did not accept that the sponsor  did  not  discuss  with  the
    appellant, her boyfriend, her application for a  job  in  the  caf�  in
    September 2013 in sufficient detail for him to  realise  that  she  was
    talking about his relative's caf�.  It was claimed that  Ms  Misiunaite
    started work on 1 October and within  three  weeks  the  appellant  had
    visited her at work and discovered that he was related to her employer.
     The  judge  noted  that  the  witnesses  contradicted  this  timescale
    including Mr Ali Celik who stated that he and  his  wife  first  became
    aware of the relationship when the appellant visited Ms  Misiunaite  at
    the caf� in November 2013 which was  after  the  couple  had  moved  in
    together.  However  this  totally  contradicted  the  evidence  of  the
    sponsor which that it was the family connection with Mr Ali Celik  that
    persuaded her to take the step to move in with the appellant.

16. Significantly, at [77] the judge found that not one  of  the  witnesses
    had given a consistent account with the other witnesses as to when  the
    parties realised the connection between the sponsor and Valentina Pukin
    and the appellant and his cousin.  The judge gave adequate reasons  for
    reaching the findings that she did  and  for  not  finding  the  stated
    circumstances in relation to the sponsor's job with a relative  of  the
    appellant's, to be credible.

Ground 7

17. It was argued that the judge erred in her findings  at  paragraph  [83]
    that she did not accept the appellant's explanation  that  it  was  too
    expensive for his parents to attend the wedding.    In relation to  the
    wedding, at [83] the judge  noted  that  the  appellant  had  described
    himself as the only son of his parents and a little bit spoilt.  It was
    in this context the judge did not give much weight to  the  appellant's
    explanation as  to  why  his  parents  did  not  attend.   It  was  his
    explanation that it was too expensive.  The judge found that given that
    Mr Ali Celik was prepared to pay for  a  wedding  party,  she  did  not
    attach much weight to the explanation as to why the parents  could  not
    attend.  That was a finding open to the  judge  on  the  basis  of  the
    evidence before her and she gave adequate  reasons  for  reaching  that
    decision.  I note that in the following paragraph  at  [84]  she  found
    that the subsequent  issue  of  the  attendance  or  otherwise  of  the
    sponsor's mother and sister was a  matter  that  raised  "even  greater
    questions" indicating that the issue of the appellant's parents perhaps
    was of lesser weight.  In all the circumstances the grounds disclose no
    error in this regard.

18. In relation to the disagreement with the judge's findings as to the non-
    attendance of the sponsor's mother and sister at the wedding  reception
    and why the judge did not find these plausible, it was  submitted  that
    the judge erred in reaching her conclusion as to "what  normal  conduct
    would be".  However this phrase must be considered in  the  context  of
    the judge's findings in their totality in relation to the wedding  (and
    indeed the relationship in general).  The judge noted that the  sponsor
    is clearly close to her mother and sister and the judge was entitled to
    reach the findings she did.   In any event even  if  it  were  arguable
    that she erred in taking into account what 'normal conduct'  would  be,
    this would not be material as it was clear from  the  judge's  findings
    that she gave significantly more weight to the fact that the  appellant
    gave an entirely different narrative from that given by his wife as  to
    why his mother-in-law and sister-in-law  did  not  attend.   The  judge
    herself states that it was "even more compelling".  I am not  satisfied
    that this ground discloses  any  material  error  as  it  was  again  a
    disagreement with the judge's findings which were properly open to her.
     The fact that as noted in the grounds for permission to appeal,  three
    of the witnesses  were  consistent  about  the  non-attendance  of  the
    sponsor's mother and sister does not indicate that the  judge  made  an
    error in finding that they did not attend.  She gave  adequate  reasons
    for this finding and again this must be considered in  the  context  of
    her overall findings that this was a false paper  trail  and  narrative
    put together to substantiate what was a marriage of convenience and  in
    terms of her findings that the witnesses were lacking in credibility.

Ground 8

19.  It  was  argued  that  the  judge  reached  her  conclusion  regarding
    cohabitation by accepting the evidence from  an  unnamed  neighbour  at
    face value without reference to the evidence of the appellant  and  his
    sponsor and that the judge did  not  give  any  reasons  for  rejecting
    witness statement evidence from  another  neighbour.   The  judge  gave
    adequate reasons, at paragraphs [85] to  [89]  for  not  accepting  the
    claims that the couple were cohabitating and again the grounds disclose
    no more than a disagreement with those adequate  findings.    The  fact
    that a neighbour was recorded in the Immigration Officer's note as  not
    having seen the sponsor and at the address was only one element in  the
    judge's conclusion that there had never been any  cohabitation  between
    the appellant and sponsor.  This included the judge's consideration  of
    the lack of belongings at what was claimed by the  sponsor  to  be  her
    permanent address together with a lack of women's toiletries.   It  was
    also clear that in finding that the  appellant  and  the  sponsor  were
    party to a sophisticated attempt to establish a false paper  trial  and
    narrative, that the judge did not accept the witness statement evidence
    of the neighbours which supported the claimed cohabitation.

20. It was also argued before me that the notes by the immigration officers
    did not feature highly in the judge's decision, although this was not a
    ground of appeal.  Even if it had been there is no error of law in  the
    judge's consideration of this evidence.  There were three 'minutes'  of
    a visit to the appellant's accommodation completed by  three  different
    immigration  officers  who  attended  the  appellant's  address  on  18
    November 2014.  The judge accepted at [87] that "some of  the  comments
    in the immigration officers'  notes  were  vague  and  subjective,  for
    example, the reference to the lack of feminine touches around the  flat
    when they visited".  However the judge went on to give her own adequate
    reasons for finding that there was no cohabitation, including the  lack
    of women's belongings (with only one dress, some underwear and only two
    pairs  of  footwear)  or  toiletries  and  the  lack  of  an   adequate
    explanation for this together with  the  information  obtained  from  a
    neighbour that they had not seen the sponsor, just Mr Ali Celik and  Ms
    Pukin.

Ground 9

21. It was argued that the judge wrongly concluded that the  appellant  did
    not know the exact amount of the rent when the figure he  gave  matched
    the amount debited from the sponsor's account.  Again the grounds which
    were expanded on in  oral  submissions  amounted  to  no  more  than  a
    disagreement with the judge's findings which looked at the evidence  of
    all the witnesses including particularly the sponsor and the  appellant
    in relation to the outgoings.  Although it was argued that the  sponsor
    continued to contribute �475 from her bank and it was  argued  in  oral
    submissions before me that this would be quite an extreme thing  to  do
    if it was a marriage of convenience, this is speculative and  does  not
    indicate any error in the approach by the judge.  The judge took all of
    these issues into consideration and  concluded  on  the  basis  of  the
    evidence that no discussions about rent had taken place which  was  why
    the sponsor thought that the rent was still �475 and that  the  sponsor
    had no idea that the rent had been increased to �500  as  she  was  not
    living at the property and did not see the letters in relation  to  the
    rent increase.  The judge  gave  adequate  reasons  for  rejecting  the
    claimed explanations and for rejecting the appellant's explanation  for
    his overestimation of the rent and the judge noted that he had  ignored
    the letters requiring a rent rise.

22. Although not pursued in oral argument, it had been  asserted  that  the
    judge also erred in her findings at [90] in relation to  the  sponsor's
    income from her employment.  The judge again gave adequate reasons  for
    her findings, including that the sponsor appeared to have no  knowledge
    of the pay slips and 'it appeared she was seeing  them  for  the  first
    time at the hearing' and that the pay slips showed  BACS  payments  but
    there were no corresponding sums arriving in her account.  It  was  the
    judge's finding that the evidence on this issue was  unclear  and  that
    the pay slips were contrived which undermined the evidence  in  general
    from the sponsor and her employer,  Ms  Pukin.   Although  the  grounds
    argued that the sponsor's evidence had been that she was paid in  cash,
    the judge was aware of this having recorded this at [32].  The  grounds
    also indicate that counsel's recording of the evidence at [38] differed
    from the judge's.  However the disputed point, as to whether or not  Ms
    Pukin stated that she had never noticed there were such  pay  slips  in
    existence, was not material to the judge's findings at [90].

23. It is clear that the grounds  amount  to  no  more  than  a  series  of
    disagreements with the findings of the judge which  are  comprehensive,
    clear and adequately reasoned.  Any minor errors are not  material  for
    the reasons given above.  In addition to the  arguments  identified  in
    the grounds for permission to appeal the judge  provided  a  number  of
    other reasons for reaching her conclusion (including  relating  to  the
    witnesses' lack of credibility at paragraphs [91] to [98]) as  detailed
    in her clear decision and reasons.
