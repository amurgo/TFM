                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a national of Pakistan.  He  appealed  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal against the decision of the Secretary of State of 22 June
    2017 refusing his application for leave to remain.

2.   The appellant entered the United Kingdom on  30  September  2010  as  a
    student with valid  leave  until  18  January  2013.   He  was  granted
    extensions to his leave to 14 May 2014 and again until 23 May 2015.  He
    married his wife on 24 May 2013.  On 3 October 2014 he was served  with
    a notice of removal from the United Kingdom.   On  4  August  2014  his
    leave was cancelled  by  the  respondent  on  the  basis  that  he  had
    fraudulently obtained the TOEIC certificate through the use of a  proxy
    test taker.  He made an application for leave to remain on the basis of
    family and private life on 19 June 2015.  That application was  refused
    on 30 October 2015.  He made a further application for leave to  remain
    on 13 January 2006, again on the basis of family and private life,  and
    this application  was  refused  on  24  September  2016.   The  refusal
    decision was certified but subsequent judicial review proceedings  were
    compromised and  thereafter  the  decision  under  challenge  was  made
    following the respondent's agreement to make a fresh decision.

3.    In  the  decision  under  challenge  the  respondent  found  that  the
    appellant had failed to meet the suitability requirements of  S-LTR  in
    paragraph R-LTRP.1.1.(d)(i) on the basis of  fraudulently  obtaining  a
    TOEIC  certificate  and  as  a  consequence  using  deception  in   his
    applications of 17 December 2012 and 13 November 2013.  As he failed to
    meet the  suitability  requirements  he  could  not  benefit  from  the
    criteria set out at EX.1 and he did not qualify for leave under the 10-
    year partner route.  Nor could he succeed under the  ten  year  private
    life route as he did not  meet  the  suitability  requirements  of  the
    Rules.  It was not  accepted  that  there  would  be  very  significant
    obstacles to his integration into Pakistan if he were required to leave
    the United Kingdom and his application therefore was unsuccessful under
    the 10-year private life route.

4.   The judge considered the evidence about the TOEIC  test  and  concluded
    that the Secretary of State had not shown that the appellant had used a
    proxy to take the test and therefore he was not a person who needed  to
    be removed from the United Kingdom and met the suitability criteria  at
    S-LTR.1.6.  The judge considered that  there  were  not  insurmountable
    obstacles to the appellant returning to live in Pakistan.  Both he  and
    his wife knew when their  relationship  began  that  he  did  not  have
    indefinite leave to remain.  He had not produced evidence to show  that
    he had integrated into life in the United Kingdom.  He had not  made  a
    private life in  the  United  Kingdom  of  any  significance.   It  was
    concluded that he could return to Pakistan and reapply under the Rules,
    noting that his wife earned over the �18,600 threshold.

5.   At a hearing on 21 September 2018 Upper Tribunal Judge  Allen  found  a
    material error of law in the judge's decision in  that  she  failed  to
    factor in  her  evaluation  of  proportionality  her  conclusion  that,
    contrary to the Secretary of State's decision, the  applicant  was  not
    guilty of fraud in relation to the English language test taken and  the
    implications of that for his leave as a consequence  should  have  been
    taken into account.  The matter  was  therefore  listed  for  rehearing
    before the Upper Tribunal on the point.

6.   Mr Toal adopted his skeleton argument and developed the points made  in
    it.  He argued first that bearing in mind that the appellant had  leave
    to remain to 23 May 2015, had that leave not been  invalidated  by  the
    decision of 4 August 2014 concerning the TOEIC test, he would have been
    able to meet the requirements of the Rules on 23 May 2015 and that  was
    the latest date on which  he  could  have  applied  within  time.   The
    likelihood was that if he had made an Appendix  FM  application  on  or
    before that date  it  would  have  been  refused  with  regard  to  the
    financial requirements of the Rules, as  it  was  accepted  that  those
    requirements were not met at that time.  There was no  suggestion  that
    he would have failed on any other basis.  However, by 21  October  2015
    his wife had been earning for the previous  six  months  in  excess  of
    �18,600 a year.  The detail of the earnings and jobs were  set  out  in
    the skeleton argument, and in any event Mr Duffy did  not  dispute  the
    evidence as to the couple's financial circumstances.

7.   A possible scenario was that if the appellant had applied for leave  to
    remain on 23 May 2015 and there had been no decision by 1 October  2015
    he could have varied his application  for  leave  to  remain  with  the
    evidence of his wife's earnings and, if so, by the time of the decision
    after 10 October 2015 the likelihood was that it would have been  found
    that the requirements of the Rules were met.

8.   An alternative scenario  to  the  leave  to  remain  application  being
    refused on the basis that the financial requirements were not  met  was
    that he would have had a right of appeal as it was a human rights claim
    as he had made an application as a spouse,  and  it  was  inconceivable
    that the appeal would have been  heard  before  1  October  2015.   The
    question for the First-tier Judge then would have been with  regard  to
    the Rules, whether the appellant met the Rules at the date of  hearing,
    not at the time of application or decision.  This was not a case  of  a
    decision under the Immigration Rules where a requirement of  the  Rules
    had to be met at the date of application or the date of decision.   The
    date of hearing would have been the appropriate date.  On the basis  of
    the evidence that would have been before the judge at  the  hearing  it
    was highly likely that by the time of the appeal hearing the  appellant
    would have been able to show  that  he  met  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules and could succeed on Article 8 grounds.  There  would
    have been no need to show insurmountable obstacles to integration  into
    Pakistan as that was only necessary  if  the  appellant  did  not  meet
    immigration  status  or  financial  requirements.   The  fact  of   his
    deprivation of a successful leave to remain application in  the  appeal
    because  of  the  erroneous  deception  decision  was  an   exceptional
    circumstance and therefore it would be a breach of his Article 8 rights
    to remove him.

9.   The other basis of the case was that as of today the appellant met  all
    the requirements of the Rules for a successful  entry  clearance  as  a
    partner under Appendix FM.  The suitability requirements were satisfied
    as he had not cheated in the English language test.  He was married  to
    a British citizen.  The  real  issue  was  the  financial  requirements
    issue.  It was set out at paragraph 9 of Mr Toal's  skeleton  how  this
    would be done on the basis of his wife's work where it  could  be  seen
    that she was earning over �22,000 a year.

10.  Reference was made to what  had  been  said  at  paragraph  51  of  the
    judgment of the Supreme Court in Agyarko [2017] 1 WLR 823 that  in  the
    case of an applicant even if residing in the United Kingdom  unlawfully
    who was otherwise certain to be granted leave to enter at least  if  an
    application was made from outside the United Kingdom there might be  no
    public interest in his or her removal, citing the decision of the House
    of Lords in Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40.  Hence, on  the  evidence  before
    the Tribunal it was fairly certain that the appellant would succeed  in
    an entry clearance application and thus there was  no  public  interest
    against the accepted interference with his Article 8 rights which  were
    established by the judge's findings that his removal  from  the  United
    Kingdom would engage Article 8.  The history of his immigration  status
    was relevant to exceptional circumstances.  It  should  be  found  that
    removal would be in breach of his Article 8 rights.

11.  In his submissions  Mr  Duffy  argued  that  the  difficulty  with  the
    submission that an October 2015 application would  meet  the  financial
    requirements was that it left out the requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE
    which made it necessary for financial details from  six  months  before
    the application to be provided.  As a consequence, the appellant  would
    never have been able to meet the requirements of the Rules, as  in  the
    six months period before the expiry of leave his wife was  not  earning
    enough  money.   So  it  was  a  question  of  whether  it   would   be
    disproportionate for a person not meeting the requirements of the Rules
    to return to their country.  It was clear from what had  been  said  by
    the High Court in Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin), that there was a  very
    small opportunity only in the case of  a  person  who  could  not  show
    insurmountable obstacles  to  meet  the  requirements  of  EX.1.(b)  in
    establishing disproportionality.  There was a very small class of cases
    where they could  succeed  outside  the  Rules  where  there  were  not
    insurmountable obstacles.  There needed to be another  reason  why  the
    appellant and his spouse could not relocate to Nigeria.  A person could
    not choose whether they would exercise their Article 8 rights.  So  the
    first basis of Mr Toal's argument could not succeed.

12.  With regard to the Agyarko point, it was  necessary  to  consider  what
    had been said in  Chikwamba.   The  historical  context  was  relevant.
    Chikwamba had found that it was not appropriate to say  that  a  person
    who cannot meet the requirements of the Rules should  apply  for  entry
    clearance and not jump the queue.  The facts of Chikwamba were that the
    appellant's partner could not go to Zimbabwe  with  her  as  he  was  a
    refugee from Zimbabwe.  That was the purpose of EX.1.  If  the  current
    scheme of the Rules had existed at that time then the matter would have
    fallen under EX.1 but here the respondent was not asking the  appellant
    to go and apply for entry clearance but was saying that they could both
    go and live in Pakistan as there were no  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    doing so.  The Chikwamba  point  did  not  bite.   An  entry  clearance
    application could be made.  There was no purpose to  the  Rule  if  the
    person did not meet its  requirements  at  the  time  and  could  still
    succeed.  There were no compelling factors outside the Rules which went
    against removal.  EX.1 could not be met  and  that  was  the  fall-back
    position.  The appeal should be dismissed.

13.  By way of reply Mr Toal argued with regard to  the  latter  point  that
    paragraph 51 of Agyarko expressed the principle very  broadly  and  was
    not confined to  cases  of  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
    elsewhere.  Chikwamba was cited as an example but not an exhaustion  of
    the possible scope of what was being said.  In any event Chikwamba  was
    expressed in broad terms and was not confined to the facts of that case
    and insurmountable obstacles and it was a question of why a person  was
    required to make  an  entry  clearance  application  if  they  met  the
    requirements of the Rules.  As regards the other  point,  the  Tribunal
    had jurisdiction to look at pre-application evidence and if not, as  Mr
    Duffy argued, it would be inconsistent with what had been said in Huang
    [2007] 2 AC 167 at paragraph 13  with  regard  to  the  nature  of  the
    appellate jurisdiction.

14.  We reserved our determination.

15.  It is clear that the appellant's leave was due  to  expire  on  23  May
    2015.  He accepts that he would not  have  been  able  to  satisfy  the
    financial requirements of the Rules had he made an  application  before
    that date as at that point his  wife's  earnings  were  �16,674.48  per
    annum.  It is likely therefore, as Mr Toal accepts, that an application
    for leave to remain would probably have been  refused  at  that  point.
    However, it appears that by 1 October 2015 he would have been  able  to
    satisfy the financial requirements of the Rules.   Mr  Toal's  argument
    that as a consequence, if by that time the Secretary of State  had  not
    determined his application for leave to remain, he would have been able
    to vary the application, or if the  application  had  been  refused  he
    would have been able to rely on his ability on or after 1 October  2015
    to satisfy the financial requirements,  is  confronted  by  Mr  Duffy's
    argument that Appendix AM-SE requires payslips covering a period of six
    months prior to  the  date  of  the  application.   One  can  see  this
    requirement set out  at  Appendix  FM-SE  paragraph  2  which  requires
    payslips covering  a  period  of  six  months  prior  to  the  date  of
    application.  (Paragraph 9, for which there is a saving in paragraph 2,
    is not applicable to the circumstances of this case).

16.  It must be right to argue as Mr Duffy does that as  a  consequence  the
    appellant would not have been able to satisfy the requirements  of  the
    Rules whenever a decision was made on his application  since  his  wife
    was not earning at the requisite level such as to enable her to provide
    payslips covering  a  period  of  six  months  prior  to  the  date  of
    application which at its latest would have had  to  have  been  23  May
    2015.  However, he would have been able by 1 October 2015 to  vary  the
    application vis-�-vis the  financial  requirement  in  accordance  with
    section 3C(5) of the Immigration Act 1971.   That  presupposes  that  a
    decision would not have made on the application before  that  date  and
    upon that it is quite impossible to say what the  position  would  have
    been.  But it would appear that by the beginning of December  2015  the
    six months' requirement would have been satisfied.

17.  So in order to have been able to satisfy the requirements of the  Rules
    the appellant would have had to make his application on  or  before  23
    May 2015, at a time when his wife's earnings  were  nearly  �2,000  per
    annum short of the requirement set out in E-ECP.3.1 and would  have  to
    had to vary it at the point at which it could be  shown  that  she  had
    been earning at the requisite level for at least six months.  And  that
    would not have been possible if the respondent had made a  decision  on
    the application for leave to remain before he had  the  opportunity  to
    vary it.  It must therefore be a matter of conjecture as to whether  or
    not this would have been possible.

18.  As regards  the alternative point made by Mr Toal that by the  time  of
    the hearing, which would certainly have taken place  some  time  later,
    the requirements of the Rules would have been satisfied  by  then,  the
    difficulty with this submission is that the requirement of the Rules is
    with regard to the need to show  payslips  covering  a  period  of  six
    months prior to the date of application at the requisite date, and that
    could not  be  cured  by  the  fact  that  earnings  had  been  at  the
    appropriate level subsequent to  that  time.   The  key  issue  is  the
    question of whether or not the requisite level  of  earnings  had  been
    earned by the appellant's wife in the six month period before the  date
    of variation of the application and that could  not  be  cured  in  the
    Tribunal.

19.  It is therefore as we say, a matter of conjecture as to whether or  not
    the requirements of the Rules that had been met  in  that  regard.   We
    will return to this point shortly.

20.  The alternative  basis  upon  which  the  claim  is  put  is  that  the
    requirements of the Rules would now be met and as a consequence if  the
    appellant were to make an application  for  entry  clearance  he  would
    succeed as he does not fall foul of the suitability requirements, it is
    accepted that he is married to a British citizen who is in  the  United
    Kingdom with whom he intends to continue living and her  income  is  at
    least �18,600.  In this regard Mr Toal, as noted above, places reliance
    on what was said by the Supreme Court in Agyarko.  With regard  to  the
    point made by Mr Duffy in respect of Chikwamba and Agyarko, we consider
    that what was said at paragraph 51  in  Agyarko  is  broader  than  the
    argument made by Mr Duffy.  The decision in Chikwamba itself is, as  Mr
    Toal argues, broader than the facts of that case, and  the  wording  of
    paragraph 51 in Agyarko makes it sufficiently clear that, as it was put
    there, an applicant, even if residing in the United Kingdom unlawfully,
    was otherwise certain to be granted leave  to  enter  at  least  if  an
    application were made from outside the United Kingdom that there  might
    be no public interest in his or her removal.  It is not  necessary  for
    there to be insurmountable obstacles  to  the  relationship  continuing
    outside the United Kingdom for this principle to bite.

21.   Bringing  these  matters  together,  we  consider   that   there   are
    difficulties with  the  first  argument  made  by  Mr  Toal  given  the
    uncertainty as to when a decision by the Secretary of State would  have
    been made on any putative varied application.  But we do see  force  in
    the alternative argument.  The appellant, through no fault of his  own,
    had his leave curtailed on the basis of a decision about the TOEIC test
    which was subsequently shown to be wrong.   That  has  had  an  adverse
    effect on him in the manner  in  which  he  sets  out  in  his  witness
    statement.  We can see no reason and none has been put  forward  as  to
    why he would not succeed in an entry clearance application on the basis
    of the matters  summarised  at  paragraph  16  of  Mr  Toal's  skeleton
    argument.  In the particular circumstances of  the  case,  although  he
    might  not  have  succeeded  in  a  variation  application  given   the
    uncertainties we have set out above,  we  consider  that  there  is  no
    public interest in his  removal  from  the  United  Kingdom  and  as  a
    consequence his appeal is allowed under Article 8.


No anonymity direction is made.
