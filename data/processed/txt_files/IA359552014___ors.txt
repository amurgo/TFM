               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

Representation:

For the Appellants:    First Appellant in person
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The First Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born  on  3rd  March  1982.
    The Second to Fourth Appellants are  her  three  minor  children.   The
    appeals of the Second to Fourth Appellants rise and fall on that of the
    First Appellant.  For the purpose of these proceedings  all  references
    herein are to the First Appellant unless specified to the contrary.

 2. The Appellants all sought entry to the United Kingdom as  visitors  for
    six months in order to visit Mr  Perez  Omoun  Perekebena  who  is  the
    husband of the First Appellant and the father of the Second, Third  and
    Fourth Appellants.  Visit visas were granted  in  Abuja  which  granted
    leave to enter the United Kingdom on 11th August  2014  with  leave  to
    remain until 11th February 2015.  The Appellants arrived in the  UK  on
    flight VS652 from  Lagos,  Nigeria  and  presented  themselves  on  the
    primary checkpoint producing valid  Nigerian  passports.   Appellant  1
    confirmed to the Immigration Control Officer that she and her  children
    would be returning to Nigeria on 11th February 2015 but was  unable  to
    produce any return tickets as evidence of this.  When questioned  about
    the schooling of her children the First Appellant replied that she  and
    her husband wanted the children to attend school whilst in  the  United
    Kingdom.  The Immigration Officer was not satisfied that the Appellants
    qualified for entry to the United Kingdom as visitors and  issued  them
    with forms IS81 submitting them all to further examination.

 3. In accordance with local procedure a search of the Appellants'  baggage
    was conducted and during the course of the baggage search the Appellant
    was found to be in possession of numerous documents which are  set  out
    in detail in form IS.125.  As a result the Appellants were detained and
    refused entry to the United Kingdom.

 4. The Appellants appealed and the appeal came before Judge of the  First-
    tier Tribunal P J M Hollingworth at the Nottingham  Justice  Centre  on
    20th November 2014.  In a determination promulgated  on  15th  December
    2014 the Appellants 'appeals were allowed.  I note however that at that
    hearing whilst the Appellants were legally represented the Secretary of
    State was not.

 5. The Secretary of State on 15th December 2014 lodged Grounds  of  Appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal.  Those grounds contended:-

      a) that there was a material misdirection in law in  that  the  First-
         tier Tribunal Judge appeared to have proceeded on the basis that in
         the absence of cross-examination the credibility of  the  Appellant
         and her Sponsor husband had to be accepted.

      b) that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had failed to resolve  conflicts
         of fact or opinion on the material matter in  particular  that  the
         Appellants had stated on their visit visa applications  they  would
         be staying for just three weeks and on arrival the First  Appellant
         stated they would be staying for six months and that the Second  to
         Fourth Appellants would be put into state schools for the  duration
         of the visit.  It was contended that the change in length  of  stay
         and the intention to put the  children  into  the  state  education
         system was contrary to the  conditions  of  their  visas  and  were
         central issues in  the  reasoning  which  led  to  the  Immigration
         Officer  concluding  that  there  had  been  such   a   change   of
         circumstances since the entry clearance was granted that  leave  of
         entry should be cancelled; and

      c) that the judge had failed to give adequate and rational  reasonings
         for finding on a material matter notably that the  undisputed  fact
         that the Appellant had applied for and been  given  a  place  on  a
         twelve month MSc course commencing shortly after her arrival  on  a
         purported three week holiday and had also asked her  employers  for
         associated study leave did not amount to a basis to find that there
         had been a change of circumstances.

 6. On 2nd February 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Shimmin found  that  the
    grounds had substance and it was arguable  they  disclosed  a  material
    error of law.  It is on that basis that the  appeal  comes  before  me.
    The Appellant appears in person.  She indicates that she while she  had
    previous legal representation she did not have it for  the  purpose  of
    this appeal.  She spoke English and I explained fully  the  process  to
    her and she indicated that she understood the process that  was  before
    her.  She further made it clear that she wished to  return  to  Nigeria
    with her children but was unable to do so until she was in  receipt  of
    my determination whatever the outcome may be  because  all  Appellants'
    passports had been detained by the Home Office pending the  outcome  of
    the appeal.  The Respondent appeared  by  her  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer Mr Jarvis.  Whilst acknowledging that this is an appeal by  the
    Secretary of State for the purpose of continuity throughout  the  legal
    proceedings Mrs Perez is referred to herein as the  Appellant  and  the
    Secretary of State is the Respondent.

Submissions/Discussion

 7. As a starting point Mr Jarvis seeks reliance upon the authorities of  K
    v The Secretary of State for the Home Department (Cï¿½te d'Ivoire) [2004]
    UKIAT 00061 and VH (Malawi) v The  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department  [2009]  EWCA  Civ  645.   In  making  reliance  upon  those
    decisions I accept that some of the findings of the  Immigration  Judge
    were made in the absence of direct cross-examination.  He accepts  that
    it is better for a Home Office Presenting Officer to have been  present
    but submits that the judge has abandoned the  appropriate  fact-finding
    process and has taken the wrong approach to cases  where  there  is  no
    Home Office Presenting Officer.   He  relies  on  the  extract  from  K
    recited at paragraph 24 of VH where the  Court  of  Appeal  had  stated
    concerning the questioning  of  witnesses  by  a  judge  on  points  of
    inconsistency and other matters of concern "what is important, however,
    in relation to those matters is that the Adjudicator should not develop
    a different case from that being presented by the other party or pursue
    his or her own theory of the case."  He submits that  this  is  exactly
    what has happened in this instance.

 8. Mr Jarvis submits that the judge has side-stepped the evidence and that
    there were documents relating to the First Appellant  staying  for  six
    months and evidence to show that the First Appellant intended to attend
    a course at the University of Buckingham.  He submits  that  there  was
    enough evidence for the judge to have engaged with and that  the  judge
    has imposed far too high a burden of proof in his analysis.  He submits
    that there is a material error of law and he asks me to set  aside  the
    decision and to re-make the  decision  dismissing  the  appeal  of  the
    Appellant.

 9. I invited Mrs Perez as to whether she wished to make  any  comments  or
    submissions.  She merely reiterates that it was her intention  to  come
    for a three week visit and that it was not her  intention  to  put  the
    children into school.  She seeks to make no further comments than  that
    but does reiterate that it is her wish to be able to  return  home  now
    with the children.

The Law

10.  Areas  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account  immaterial   considerations,
    reaching irrational conclusions  on  fact  or  evaluation  or  to  give
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

11. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged.  Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail to
    deal with every  factual  issue  of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story is untrue.  If  a  point  of
    evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is  a
    failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings on Error of Law

12. It is never easy for an Immigration Judge when  there  is  not  a  Home
    Office Presenting Officer there to put  their  case  particularly  when
    they are faced by a legal representative.  However in this  instance  I
    am satisfied that the approach of the judge in treating the Appellants'
    evidence as uncontroverted leads to the conclusion that the  judge  may
    well have proceeded  on  the  basis  that  in  the  absence  of  cross-
    examination the Appellants' credibility should be accepted.  That is in
    contradiction to the correct approach particularly that set down in  VJ
    (Malawi).  Further the judge has failed to resolve the conflicts in his
    determination of two material matters  in  particular  namely  conflict
    between the length of visit stipulated as three weeks and latterly  six
    months and  the  version  of  events  and  explanations  given  by  the
    Appellant and secondly has failed to give adequate and rational reasons
    for findings namely in respect of the outcome of the bag  search  which
    strongly indicated the intention of the Appellant was not  declared  to
    the  Entry  Clearance  Officer.   The  fact-finding  exercise  has  not
    therefore been properly carried out.  In all circumstances I find there
    is a material error of law and I set aside the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

Re-Making/Re-Hearing the Evidence

13. Once again the First  Appellant  emphasises  that  the  length  of  her
    proposed visit was three weeks and that it was not her intention to put
    the children into school.  I am however referred at some length  by  Mr
    Jarvis to the refusal/cancellation of leave to enter/remain  report  of
    the Home Office.  In particular he refers me to the appendices attached
    and the verbatim transcript of the interview with Mr Perekebena  to  be
    found at Appendix 6.  He points out that  the  salient  points  of  the
    interview are that Mr Perekebena stated his family  would  be  visiting
    for three weeks and he had completed  his  wife's  application  on  her
    behalf.

14. When asked about the fact that he had previously mentioned  his  family
    would be staying for six months and that he was now stating they  would
    be staying for only three weeks his response was that he had not  known
    to whom he was talking and thought it was the taxi driver calling.   Mr
    Jarvis quite  understandably  suggests  that  such  an  approach  casts
    considerable doubt on the credibility of Mr Perekebena's testimony.

15. Mr Jarvis further submits that the Immigration Officer was entitled  to
    raise all discrepancies due to the change of circumstances and takes me
    to the documentary evidence found in the Appellant's baggage submitting
    that that clearly demonstrates an intention by the First  Appellant  to
    study whilst in the  United  Kingdom  and  for  the  Second  to  Fourth
    Appellants to attend school which would breach the conditions  attached
    to their visas.  He submits that  these  documents  cast  even  further
    doubt on the credibility of the testimony both of the  First  Appellant
    and of the Appellant's husband.

16. I specifically raised the issue of a letter from the  chairman  of  the
    local government  service  commission  Yenagoa.   The  First  Appellant
    confirmed that she was the  author  of  this  letter  and  it  had  her
    signature upon it.  That letter states and I  quote  verbatim,  "Having
    been offered  admission  to  read  MSc  in  Psychology,  University  of
    Buckingham, UK I humbly wish to apply for study with  pay  with  effect
    from 1st  September  2014."   I  specifically  enquired  of  the  First
    Appellant as how she reconciled  that  letter  with  her  intention  to
    undertake a three week visit.  She was  evasive  in  her  response  but
    merely replied in the end that she did not come here to study.

17. Mr Jarvis asked me to find that there is no reasonable explanation  for
    the documents in the  First  Appellant's  luggage  unless  it  was  her
    intention to remain here for  a  substantial  period  of  time  and  to
    undertake a course at  Buckingham  University.   He  submits  that  the
    Immigration Officer was justified in carrying out  the  search  and  in
    finding inconsistencies in the evidence between the First Appellant and
    her husband.  He asked  me  to  re-make  the  decision  dismissing  the
    Appellant's appeal.

18. I invited the First Appellant as she was a litigant  in  person  as  to
    whether there was anything further she wished to say and that  I  would
    listen without interruption to it.  She replied that she did not.

Findings on the Re-Hearing

19. There is considerable evidence in the documents produced  to  which  no
    reasonable or consistent answer has been given firstly that it was  the
    intention of the First Appellant to attend a course at  the  University
    of Buckingham and secondly that  in  attending  that  course  it  would
    inevitably be that she would be requiring her three children to  attend
    school in the UK.  Further she does not challenge the comment  directly
    made by her husband (who does not attend this appeal) that when  making
    comments originally about the length of stay of  his  wife's  visit  he
    thought he was talking to a taxi driver.  Documentary evidence produced
    and the inconsistencies of the Appellant's testimony as against that of
    her original application cast considerable  doubt  on  her  version  of
    events and of her intentions and her  family's  intentions  as  to  the
    length  of  time  they  intended  to  remain  in  the  UK.    In   such
    circumstances I am satisfied  that  the  Immigration  Authorities  were
    perfectly entitled to detain the Appellants at the point of  entry  and
    to make findings of fact that there was such a change of  circumstances
    in their case since leave  was  granted  that  their  leave  should  be
    cancelled.  Consequently the  appeal  of  the  Secretary  of  State  is
    upheld.

20. It is worth recalling that of course the only reason that  this  matter
    has come back before me is because the Appellant seeks to leave the  UK
    without a stain on her visa record.  For the reasons given  above  that
    clearly will not happen.  It is ironic that for several months  now  it
    has been the wish of the First Appellant to  return  to  Nigeria  along
    with her children.  She cannot do  so  until  the  conclusion  of  this
    appeal and thereafter the return of her and the  children's  passports.
    I trust that once the Home Office are in receipt  of  a  copy  of  this
    determination it will be possible for arrangements to be made  for  the
    First Appellant and her children to promptly leave the United  Kingdom.
    The Appellant has indicated that that is her wish but no doubt it  will
    be the wish of the Secretary of State to be present and to ensure  that
    that                            takes                            place.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material error  of  law.
I set aside that decision and re-make the decision  for  the  re-hearing  of
this matter dismissing the appeal of the  First  to  Fourth  Appellants  (it
being noted that the appeals of the Second to  Fourth  Appellants  rise  and
fall on that of the First Appellant) and  that  the  decision  of  the  Home
Office cancelling the Appellants' entry clearance is confirmed.

No anonymity direction is made.
