For the Respondent:    Mr M Trevelyan, Counsel, instructed by Duncan Lewis



                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   In this decision the Appellant is  referred  to  as  the  Secretary  of
    State and the Respondent is referred to as the Claimant.

2.   The Claimant a national of Somalia, date of birth  [  ]  1988  appealed
    against the Secretary of State's decision,  dated  29  April  2015,  to
    refuse leave to remain following the refusal of an asylum claim.
3.   The matter went on appeal and came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  D
    Lloyd (the judge) who on 12 October 2015 allowed the appeal on  Refugee
    Convention grounds.  Permission to appeal was sought by  the  Secretary
    of State and given by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  P  J  G  White  on  4
    November 2015.  On 20 November 2015  Duncan  Lewis  on  behalf  of  the
    Claimant made a Rule 24 response  essentially  supporting  the  judge's
    decision.
4.   Before me, Mr McVeety relies upon the grounds  settled  in  support  of
    the application for permission and in  a  nutshell  essentially  argued
    that the judge had failed to properly address  relevant  considerations
    pertinent to the issue of the return  of  the  Claimant  to  Mogadishu,
    particularly by reference to the case of  MOI  and  Others  (Return  to
    Mogadishu) Somalia CG [2014] UKUT 442 (IAC).
5.   In the decision [D] the judge set  out  relevant  facts  and  there  is
    essentially no challenge to those matters.  I note that  the  Secretary
    of State was represented and it is clear from the decision  that  there
    was some recitation of the  Secretary  of  State's  position  including
    reference to MOJ and Others.  I conclude that the judge   set  out  the
    correct legal approach.  What is  disputed  is  the  extent  to  which,
    having extensively recited parts of the decision  in  MOJ,   the  judge
    failed to address those particularly arising under  paragraph  (ix)  of
    the head note of MOJ, including  as  it  were  various  bullet  pointed
    issues which needed to be considered, even if  not  all  were  directly
    relevant.
6.   The judge [D29] accepted,  presumably  on  the  basis  of  the  general
    credibility of the Claimant, that  there  was  nothing  implausible  or
    unlikely about his account and accepted on that basis that  there  were
    no remaining family links in Somalia.  To do so in the way he  did  was
    not the most helpful way to assess the reliability of  a  story  but  I
    infer that the judge's view was reached because he generally found  the
    Claimant a credible witness of fact: if he had  he  not  done  so  then
    there would necessarily have been  findings  of  fact  adverse  to  the
    credibility or reliability of the claim or the claimed risk on return.

7.   The judge went on [D30]  to  set  out  up-to-date  country  information
    produced  by  the  COIR  dated  March  2015  which  sets  out  relevant
    considerations that could be  in  play  vis-ï¿½-vis  the  Claimant  as  a
    Bravanese, an ethnic minority in Somalia, which might apply.

8.   The judge concluded on the basis of the facts that  he  found  and  his
    findings on credibility that although remittances would  be  available,
    with the lack of family support structure, the Claimant faced the  real
    risk of becoming an IDP from an ethnic minority in an  Al-Shabaab  area
    with all the attendant risks of ill-treatment, lack of  protection  and
    internal relocation not being a reasonable option.

9.   It is fair to say that the judge's reasoning could have been fuller  on
    the issue of internal relocation but in the light of the findings  that
    were made and the positive findings that were by inference made. I  was
    satisfied the judge, had he given fuller reasons,  in  all  likelihood,
    would have reached the same decision.

10.  Accordingly, in those circumstances whilst it is not by any  means  the
    most effectively drafted decision, it  gives  adequate  and  sufficient
    reasons and such error claimed by the Respondent as  was  made  by  the
    judge did not materially affect the outcome of the appeal.
 DECISION
11.  The Original Tribunal's decision stands.
         The appeal of the Secretary of State is dismissed.

ANONYMITY ORDER
An anonymity order was previously made by the judge in September 2015 and  I
can see no reason why that order should not be continued.

DIRECTION REGARDING ANONYMITY - RULE 14 OF  THE  TRIBUNAL  PROCEDURE  (UPPER
TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008
Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
