For the Respondent:    Mrs H Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Details of the Appellant

 1. The appellant a citizen of Pakistan, born on 2 August 1988, appealed to
    the First-tier Tribunal against the decision by the  respondent,  dated
    15 May 2019, to refuse the appellant's application for leave to  remain
    on the basis of his family  life  with  his  partner.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal, in a decision promulgated on  1  July  2019,  dismissed  that
    appeal.

 2. The appellant appeals with Upper Tribunal permission on the basis  that
    it was arguable that when assessing proportionality the fact  that  the
    appellant can meet  the  financial  requirements  of  the  Rules  is  a
    material consideration and given that it  was  arguable  the  sponsor's
    earnings were sufficient to meet the Rules,  it  was  further  arguable
    that the judge did not take this into account.

Background

 3. The appellant was married to a previous partner in 2010  and  submitted
    an unsuccessful EEA residence card.  The  findings  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, which are not disputed, indicate  that  that  marriage  broke
    down and they separated in 2012.  The appellant  began  a  relationship
    with the sponsor, who is his  cousin,  in  August  2013.   The  sponsor
    obtained employment in February 2016  and  the  appellant  applied  for
    divorce in or around this time.  The appellant's divorce was  finalised
    on 1 June 2018 and the couple entered an Islamic marriage on 27 January
    2018.

 4. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Gurung-Thapa found that there were  no
    insurmountable obstacles under  paragraph  EX.1(b),  meaning  the  very
    significant difficulties, that would be faced by the applicant or their
    partner in continuing family life outside the UK.  The judge also  took
    into consideration Agyarko v SSHD [2017] UKSC 11 and  reminded  herself
    that such  obstacles  were  to  be  understood  in  the  practical  and
    realistic sense rather than referring solely to obstacles which make it
    literally impossible for the family to live together in the country  of
    origin of the non-national.  Having made reasoned findings from [20] to
    [55], which were not substantively challenged  before  me,  that  there
    were no insurmountable obstacles, the judge went on to consider Article
    8 outside the Immigration Rules.  The judge was  satisfied  that  there
    were no exceptional circumstances.  In the alternative the  judge  went
    on to consider the five-stage test in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  The judge
    directed herself appropriately in relation to  the  relevant  case  law
    concluding accepting that  the  fact  that  there  were  insurmountable
    obstacles  is  not  determinative  of  the  issue  of  proportionality.
    However, it is an indication that removal would not be disproportionate
    if there were no other circumstances which  point  in  the  appellant's
    favour in the balance and the judge reminded herself what was  said  by
    the Supreme Court in Agyarko at paragraph 57 that in general  in  cases
    concerned with precarious family life a very  strong  or  a  compelling
    reason is required to  outweigh  the  public  interest  in  immigration
    control.

 5. The judge went on to find at [43] that it was not unreasonable for  the
    appellant and the sponsor to continue their family or private  life  in
    Pakistan concluding that the parties  ought  to  have  known  from  the
    outset that there was no right for them to choose their  country  where
    family life could be enjoyed and that the sponsor chose to enter into a
    relationship with the appellant knowing that he had no leave to remain.
     The judge then considered Part 5A of the Nationality, Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002, Section 117, and found taking into  consideration  all
    the factors including that there  was  nothing  to  indicate  that  the
    appellant might come within the scope of Chikwamba v SSHD  [2008]  UKHL
    40, that removal was disproportionate.

Error of Law Hearing

 6. Mr Hussain relied on two main grounds before me.  The first ground  was
    in relation to Judge Gurung-Thapa's consideration of Article 8  outside
    of the Rules, it being submitted that she had failed to address whether
    it  was  "reasonable"  to  expect  the  appellant  to  leave  given  in
    particular that the appellant is British and is employed by the NHS  as
    a speciality personal assistant for community  paediatrics,  earning  a
    salary well above the ï¿½18,600 level and does not  claim  benefits.   Mr
    Hussain made submissions about the appellant's medical  conditions  and
    submitted in all the circumstances that it was not reasonable to uproot
    a British citizen in these circumstances to Pakistan and that the judge
    had failed to assess the sponsor's medical conditions in the context of
    her right to free treatment as a British citizen in the UK and  someone
    who earns well above the threshold  that  the  respondent  has  set  in
    Immigration Rules.  In Mr Hussain's second ground he submitted that  it
    was accepted by the respondent  that  the  sponsor  met  the  financial
    requirements in the Reasons for Refusal Letter at  page  3  of  7.   In
    those circumstances it was submitted that the judge  failed  to  factor
    this consideration in her findings on Article 8 outside the Immigration
    Rules.  Mr Hussain relied on paragraph 34 of Agyarko  and  the  Supreme
    Court together with paragraph 36.

 7. Mr Hussain emphasised that the sponsor met the  financial  requirements
    and submitted that the judge had erred in law in stating at  [51]  that
    she did not "find that there is anything to indicate that the appellant
    might come within the scope  of  Chikwamba  v  SSHD  [2008]  UKHL  40".
    Although the judge had stated in her consideration of Section 117  that
    there was no evidence the appellant was reliant on taxpayers  and  that
    financial independence was a neutral factor, this failed to  adequately
    consider the  fact  that  the  financial  requirements  were  met.   In
    relation to  the  English  language  requirement  Mr  Hussain  accepted
    although there was no evidence of this before the First-tier  Tribunal,
    and accepted that the judge had found that there was  no  evidence  the
    appellant spoke English and  he  gave  evidence  in  Urdu,  Mr  Hussain
    strayed into giving evidence in claiming that the level required is the
    most basic level and "won't  be  a  problem"  for  the  appellant.   He
    submitted that the judge had failed to give any  good  reason  why  the
    sponsor should have to leave the UK.

 8. For the Home Office Mrs  Aboni  relied  on  the  respondent's  Rule  24
    response and submitted that the grounds of appeal were  an  attempt  to
    reargue the case and that the fact that the sponsor may earn enough  to
    meet the financial requirements of the Rules was only  one  factor  and
    that the appellant had failed to meet the English language requirements
    and  the  immigration  status  requirements.   The  judge   had   fully
    considered that there were no insurmountable obstacles  to  the  couple
    continuing family life outside the United  Kingdom  and  then  went  on
    properly to consider the case outside of the Immigration Rules and came
    to the sustainable conclusion that removal was proportionate.   It  was
    her submission that the judge was clearly aware that the appellant  met
    the financial requirements including that reference was made at [48] to
    financial independence but it was evident, and the judge  was  entitled
    to take into account, that not all the requirements were met in finding
    as she did that this was not a case  that  came  within  the  scope  of
    Chikwamba.





Error of Law Conclusions

Ground 1

 9. Mr Hussain's first ground was without merit; Mr Hussain was  attempting
    to make a false distinction in relation to  the  judge's  findings,  in
    stating that she had failed to consider whether it was  reasonable  for
    the British  sponsor  to  relocate  to  Pakistan.   The  judge  in  her
    consideration of Article 8 outside of the Immigration Rules  took  into
    account her findings under the Immigration Rules  that  there  were  no
    insurmountable obstacles which included a detailed consideration of all
    the factors including the fact that the sponsor had a job in the UK and
    family here and made findings on all of  those  factors  together  with
    findings on the appellant's health and that there was  no  evidence  to
    suggest   she   would   not   be   able    to    receive    appropriate
    treatment/medication in Pakistan.

10. The judge was clearly aware of the different  applicable  test  outside
    the Immigration Rules and her findings  indicate  that  she  was  fully
    cognisant of the sponsor's circumstances; the  judge  was  entitled  to
    find as she did that there was nothing very  strong  or  compelling  in
    this case which concerned precarious family life  that  might  outweigh
    the public interest in immigration control  including  as  the  factors
    which the appellant relied on were largely the  factors  relied  on  in
    relation to the application under the Immigration Rules.

11. However the judge specifically addressed,  having  considered  all  the
    factors, that it  had  not  been  shown  to  be  unreasonable  for  the
    appellant and the sponsor to continue their family or private  life  in
    Pakistan, at [43].   That  finding  was  available  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  No error of law is disclosed.

Ground 2

12. With respect to ground 2, although the judge may not have  specifically
    set out that the appellant and sponsor met the  financial  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules (which had been accepted at page 3 of 7 of the
    refusal  letter)  in  her  Article  8  consideration  outside  of   the
    Immigration Rules, that is not fatal to the  decision.   The  sponsor's
    ability to meet the financial requirements is implicit in her findings,
    including that the appellant and sponsor had  "financial  independence"
    at [48] albeit that this finding was in  the  context  of  it  being  a
    neutral factor under Section 117.

13. The judge also specifically turned her mind at [51] to Chikwamba.  What
    the judge was saying at [51], was that considering all the  factors  on
    which she had already made findings: including that the  appellant  had
    been an overstayer and the relationship had begun  when  the  appellant
    had known he had no leave to remain, that there was  no  evidence  that
    the appellant spoke English;  the  fact  that  the  appellant  met  the
    financial requirements of the Immigration Rules would not be sufficient
    to come within the ambit of Chikwamba and Agyarko v  SSHD  [2017]  UKSC
    11, in that it had not been shown that an application to  return  would
    be "otherwise certain to be granted leave to enter".

14. I have considered what was said by this Tribunal in guidance in R (on
    the application of Chen) v Secretary of State for the Home Department)
    (Appendix FM - Chikwamba - temporary separation - proportionality) IJR
    [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC) which is summarised in the headnote as follows:
    "(i) Appendix FM does not include consideration of the question whether
    it would be disproportionate to expect an individual to return to his
    home country to make an entry clearance application to re-join family
    members in the U.K. There may be cases in which there are no
    insurmountable obstacles to family life being enjoyed outside the U.K.
    but where temporary separation to enable an individual to make an
    application for entry clearance may be disproportionate. In all cases,
    it will be for the individual to place before the Secretary of State
    evidence that such temporary separation will interfere
    disproportionately with protected rights. It will not be enough to rely
    solely upon the case-law concerning Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40.
    (ii) Lord Brown was not laying down a legal test when he suggested in
    Chikwamba that requiring a claimant to make an application for entry
    clearance would only "comparatively rarely" be proportionate in a case
    involving children (per Burnett J, as he then was, in R (Kotecha and
    Das v SSHD [2011] EWHC 2070 (Admin)).
    (iii) In an application for leave on the basis of an Article 8 claim,
    the Secretary of State is not obliged to consider whether an
    application for entry clearance (if one were to be made) will be
    successful. Accordingly, her silence on this issue does not mean that
    it is accepted that the requirements for entry clearance to be granted
    are satisfied.
    (iv) In cases where the Immigration Rules (the "IRs") do not fully
    address an Article 8 claim so that it is necessary (pursuant to R
    (Nagre)) to consider the claim outside the IRs, a failure by the
    decision maker to consider Article 8 outside the IRs will only render
    the decision unlawful if the claimant in fact shows that there has been
    (or, in a permission application, arguably has been) a substantive
    breach of his or her rights under Article 8."

15. The jurisprudence reminds therefore that the Chikwamba principle
    requires a fact-specific assessment and that it only applies in a very
    clear case and even then would not necessarily result in a grant of
    leave to remain (see including R (on the application of Kaur) v SSHD
    [2018] EWCA Civ 1423).

16. The judge was correct in saying in terms, as she did at [51]  that  the
    Chikwamba principle does not assist this appellant. The factual  matrix
    is different. It is not the case that this appellant would be  required
    to leave the UK and apply  for  entry  clearance  to  comply  with  the
    respondent's policy. Unlike the Chikwamba appellant, I agree  with  Mrs
    Aboni that it not been shown that it is a certainty that this Appellant
    would be granted entry clearance, including as the appellant had failed
    to meet the English language requirements and  the  immigration  status
    requirements.  Although as discussed above there was evidence, and  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  made  findings,  including  in  relation  to  the
    sponsor's life and work in the  UK  and  the  claimed  difficulties  in
    relocating, Mr Hussain did  not  refer  me  to  any  adequate  evidence
    adduced in relation  to  any  claimed  difficulties  with  a  temporary
    separation.

17. Whilst the First-tier Tribunal's findings  on  this  point  were  brief
    therefore, they were adequate and there was no material  error  in  the
    judge's findings that  there  was  effectively  no  evidence  that  the
    appellant's removal, including a temporary separation which  the  judge
    was considering at [51], would interfere  disproportionately  with  the
    protected  rights   of   family   members   whether   cumulatively   or
    individually.

Decision

18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain  an  error  of
    law and shall stand.  The appellant's appeal is dismissed.

    No anonymity application was made or is appropriate in this case.
