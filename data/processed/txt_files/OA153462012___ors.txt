Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Dewison, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr G Brown of Counsel


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) This is an appeal with permission by the Entry Clearance Officer  against
   a decision by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal A D Smith MBE, TD allowing
   these appeals.  The respondents  are  a  mother  and  two  children,  all
   nationals of Iraq.

2) The appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was brought  against  decisions  of
   the Entry Clearance Officer refusing the respondent's entry clearance  as
   the spouse and children of Mr Faik Tahir Qazi, who  is  the  sponsor  for
   their applications for entry clearance and is present and settled in  the
   UK.  There are two older children of  the  family,  who  were  originally
   parties to the appeal, but their appeals were withdrawn before the First-
   tier Tribunal.

3) Before the First-tier Tribunal the appeals  turned  upon  the  issues  of
   maintenance and accommodation.  The issue of accommodation was decided in
   favour of the respondents on the basis of documentary  evidence  produced
   by the sponsor.

4)  This  left  the  issue  of  maintenance.   The  applications  for  entry
   clearance were made prior to the change in the  Immigration  Rules  on  9
   July 2012 and were therefore dealt with under paragraphs 281 and 297.  It
   was accepted by the judge that  maintenance  would  be  adequate  if  the
   sponsor's income equalled the amount of income  support  which  would  be
   payable to a family of their composition, together  with  housing  costs.
   The judge further considered that if there was a shortfall below this sum
   in the sponsor's income then savings could be taken into account to  make
   up the shortfall over the period for which leave to enter would  subsist,
   in accordance with Jahangara Begum [2011] UKUT 246.

5) The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal recorded that it was agreed  between
   the parties that the level of  income  required  to  constitute  adequate
   maintenance was �312.53 per week.  This figure was derived by taking  the
   level of income support for a couple with two children and adding  to  it
   �15.05 for mortgage payments and �38.89 per month for council  tax.   The
   judge noted that although these were the figures agreed  by  the  parties
   for mortgage payments and council tax they appeared to be the  wrong  way
   round but nothing turned on this.

6) The judge noted that the sponsor is employed on a salary of  �15,533  per
   annum.  Overtime is not  guaranteed  but  it  may  be  worked  if  it  is
   available.  The judge referred to the sponsor's P60 for the year ending 5
   April 2012 which showed earnings of �17,375.31 before  tax  and  national
   insurance deductions.  After deductions of  �1,979  the  net  salary  was
   �15,396.  Dividing this by 52 gave weekly earnings  after  tax  of  �296.
   The judge noted, however, that in the 2 preceding tax years  the  sponsor
   received higher earnings.  On the same  calculation  his  average  weekly
   income in 2010/11 was �310 and in 2009/10 it was �317.82.  The employment
   in the previous years was with the same employer although the name of the
   employer had changed owing to a takeover.

7) The judge noted that the earnings figures for 2011/12 gave a  short  fall
   of about �16 per week.  It appeared to the  judge,  however,  that  going
   back over a 3 year period, the appellant had earned  significantly  more,
   presumably on the basis that more overtime was available.  If the average
   weekly earnings over the previous 3 years were taken  into  account  then
   the sponsor's weekly earnings after deductions were  �307.   The  sponsor
   had available to him savings of �1,298 at the date of decision,  although
   this had increased to �1,936 by the date of the hearing.  The judge noted
   that the sponsor's currently weekly income was very  near  to  the  level
   considered adequate.  The shortfall on his weekly earnings arrived at  by
   averaging the previous 3 years earnings gave a figure of approximately �5
   per week.  The sponsor's savings were sufficient to bring the maintenance
   up to an adequate level without becoming exhausted.  The period for which
   leave would be granted would be two years but the savings  were  adequate
   to support the family at this level for  five  years.   Accordingly,  the
   Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  was  satisfied  that  there  would  be
   adequate maintenance without recourse to public funds.

8) In the grounds of the application for  permission  to  appeal  the  Entry
   Clearance Officer pointed out that the judge had calculated the shortfall
   in income of �5 per week by averaging out the sponsor's earnings over a 3
   year period.  The judge noted that the sponsor's earnings were  lower  in
   the tax year 2011/12 than in the 2 preceding years and surmised that more
   overtime was available in the previous years.  The judge failed to reason
   adequately why the figure for overtime would be expected to  increase  in
   the foreseeable future as the sponsor's earnings showed a downward  trend
   and at the date of decision there was no evidence that they  were  likely
   to increase.  If the sponsor's earnings of �15,396 in the last  tax  year
   were taken, after housing costs had been met this left the family with  a
   shortfall of �16 per week.  The period for which leave would  be  granted
   would be 27 months, not 24, and this would mean that  the  sponsor  would
   require �1,728 to  meet  the  shortfall.   The  sponsor's  savings  were,
   however, no more than �1,298 at the date of decision.

9) Following the grant of permission to appeal the Entry  Clearance  Officer
   wrote to the Tribunal pointing  out  that  there  was  an  error  in  the
   calculation in the application for permission to appeal.   The  shortfall
   alleged of �16 had been multiplied by 108 weeks  but  the  figure  should
   have been multiplied by 117 weeks, which was the number of weeks in a  27
   month period.  If the 117 week period  had  been  used  then  the  amount
   required from the sponsor's savings was �1,872.

Submissions
10) At the hearing before me Mr Dewison, appearing for the  Entry  Clearance
   Officer, argued that it was inappropriate for the judge  to  average  out
   the sponsor's earnings over 3 years.  The  date  by  reference  to  which
   earnings should be calculated was the  date  of  decision.   The  judge's
   approach was wrong and arrived at a figure which was not  representative.
   Mr Dewison hypothesised that if within the 3 year period the sponsor  had
   been unemployed for a period then the average earnings over the  3  years
   would be much less.

11) The figures set out in the P60 for the year ending 5  April  2012  were,
   Mr Dewison continued, not disputed.  The shortfall on the basis of  these
   earnings was �16.66 per week.  Furthermore the judge had used the  period
   of leave for which the sponsor would have to rely on  his  savings  as  2
   years whereas the correct period was 27 months.  The judge's  methodology
   was flawed.  The decision should be remade according to the  evidence  at
   the date of decision.

12) For the respondents Mr Brown submitted that there was no  authority  for
   the basis on which earnings should be calculated.   He  referred  to  the
   case of KA (Pakistan) [2006] UKAIT 00065.  The question was whether there
   would be adequate maintenance without  recourse  to  public  funds.   The
   judge was entitled to assess the  evidence  to  decide  this.   Mr  Brown
   referred to the case of Yarce (adequate maintenance: benefits [2012] UKUT
   00425.  He submitted that the grounds of challenge were no  more  than  a
   disagreement with the manner of assessment  in  the  determination.   The
   judge needed to look at the yardstick of �312.73.  He was  aware  of  KA.
   He looked at the sponsor's employment history.  The judge was entitled to
   take a broad view in calculating the  sponsor's  average  weekly  income.
   The judge had also faced the disadvantage that there was no  respondent's
   bundle before the First-tier Tribunal.

13) The question was raised of whether the judge was entitled to  take  into
   account the most favourable period for the respondents in calculating the
   sponsor's earnings.  Mr Brown submitted that the judge was entitled to do
   this and there was no error of law arising as a  result.   There  was  no
   authority to prevent the judge from doing this.  The disagreement by  the
   Entry Clearance Officer was only with the method chosen by the judge  for
   calculating earnings.  If the sponsor's savings of �1,129 were divided by
   117  weeks this gave �11 per week, which  was  more  than  sufficient  to
   cover the shortfall.  Mr Brown further referred in passing  to  a  letter
   from the sponsor's employer stating that it was likely that the  employer
   would be able to offer employment to the first respondent.

14) In response Mr Dewison submitted that it made no sense to  arrive  at  a
   figure for earnings on the relevant date by averaging earnings over  a  3
   year period.  The money from previous years would have  been  spent.   It
   was necessary to look at the date of the decision, or the  period  around
   that day, which was established by the P60.  Mr Dewison pointed out  that
   there was a letter from the employer giving earnings  for  the  period  1
   January 2012 to 15 July 2012 and  this  period  could  have  been  taken,
   excluding the period after the date of decision.   The  average  for  the
   period in question was given by the employer as �340.94 gross or  �278.76
   net.  Mr Dewison questioned whether the judge's decision was  reasonable.



Discussion
15) Mr Brown referred me to paragraphs 27-29 of the case of Yarce, in  which
   he submitted the relevant principles set out as follows:

      "27.  The requirement  to  show  that  a  person  or  persons  can  be
           maintained (or will maintain  themselves)  "adequately"  without
           recourse to  public  funds  has  long  been  a  feature  of  the
           Immigration Rules.  It continues to be a requirement for various
           categories of person, in the amended rules that came into  force
           on 9 July 2012 (but see esp. Appendix FM  (Family  Members)  and
           Appendix FM-SE) Family  Members  -  Specified  Evidence)).   The
           former version of the rules applies to the  present  appeal  and
           those others where the decision  concerned  was  made  before  9
           July.  In order to  establish  that  maintenance  is  "adequate"
           under those rules, an applicant needs to show that the resources
           available will meet or exceed the relevant income support  level
           set by the United  Kingdom  Government  ("the  target  figure").
           This  finding  of  the  Asylum  &  Immigration  Tribunal  in  KA
           (Pakistan) [2006] UKAIT 00065 has been approved by the Court  of
           Appeal in AM v Entry Clearance Officer [2008] EWCA Civ  1082  (a
           finding unaffected by  the  subsequent  appeal  to  the  Supreme
           Court) and French v Entry Clearance  Officer  (Kingston)  [2011]
           EWCA Civ 35 (the KA principle is reflected in the definitions of
           "adequate" and "adequately" in the July  2012  rules).   If  the
           applicant is intending to live with a spouse or partner  in  the
           United Kingdom, the income support level that  he  or  she  must
           meet will be such level as has been set  by  the  government  in
           respect of the couple.  Where children are included, the  target
           figure will be increased by the relevant figure or  figures  for
           each dependant child.


      28.    KA  (Pakistan)  establishes  that  the  target  figure  is   an
           "objective" one.  It is therefore immaterial that the  applicant
           and/or any relevant family, as was described, can be shown to be
           more likely than not to live on less than that figure.


      29.   The present case requires an examination of the effect, if  any,
           that the arrival of an applicant  for  entry  clearance  upon  a
           sponsor's entitlement to certain  benefits  and,  thus,  on  the
           ability of the applicant  to  demonstrate  there  are  available
           resources at or above the target figure.  It particularly raises
           questions about the effect of (a) payments from a  third  party;
           and (b) capital sums.  In  determining  an  immigration  appeal,
           involving whether a person can be maintained and/or accommodated
           without additional recourse to public funds (within the  meaning
           of paragraph 6 and 6A to C of the  immigration  rules:  see  the
           Schedule to this determination), it will often be vital that the
           judicial fact-finder determines the  relationship  between  such
           payments/capital and the sponsor's entitlement to benefits, once
           the applicant has hypothetically arrived.  Only by  establishing
           this can proper findings be made  as  to  the  actual  financial
           position of the individuals concerned."

16) Mr Dewison's principal submission  on  behalf  of  the  Entry  Clearance
   Officer was that the earnings should be  calculated  by  reference  to  a
   period as close  as  possible  to  the  date  of  decision.   Mr  Dewison
   acknowledged at the hearing that it would not be appropriate to look only
   at the date of decision.  This might be a date on which the  sponsor  was
   not working or on which his earnings were  inconsistent  with  his  usual
   earnings.  Mr Dewison acknowledged that a period had to be selected  over
   which the  sponsor's  earnings  were  to  be  assessed.   He  maintained,
   however, that the judge was not entitled to  have  regard  to  a  3  year
   period as the 3 year period preceded the date of decision by too long and
   this amounted to an error of law.  Mr Dewison further submitted that  the
   approach taken by the judge in this decision for calculating earnings was
   unreasonable.

17) Mr Brown's position was that there was no authority which  required  the
   judge to have regard to a particular period.  This appears to be correct.
    Certainly neither party could  refer  me  to  any  such  authority.   Mr
   Dewison suggested two alternative periods  which  the  judge  might  have
   taken to calculate the sponsor's earnings.  One of these was the tax year
   ending 5 April 2012 and the other was the period of just  over  6  months
   from 1 January 2012 until the date of decision.  Mr Dewison  acknowledged
   that either of these periods would have been acceptable.

18) To some extent, by suggesting these two alternative periods  Mr  Dewison
   revealed the flaw in his argument.  To take the 6 months or so  prior  to
   the date of decision would at least constitute a period leading up to the
   date of decision.  To take the tax year ending on 5 April 2012,  however,
   would be to take a period which ended about 3 months prior to the date of
   decision.  In accepting that the period of the tax year up until 5  April
   2012 would have been an appropriate period to which the judge might  have
   had regard for the purpose of  calculating  the  sponsor's  earnings,  Mr
   Dewison was implicitly accepting that the period to be taken into account
   need not end at or near the date of decision.

19) The approach of the judge was  to  take  a  long  term  average  of  the
   sponsor's earnings over a 3 year period. Mr Dewison suggested  that  this
   might not be appropriate because a  3  year  period  could  contain,  for
   example, a period of unemployment.  This was not the case, however,  with
   this particular sponsor who had worked throughout the 3 year  period,  as
   his tax records showed.

20) Essentially the argument came down to whether the judge was entitled  to
   take into account a longer  period,  over  which  the  sponsor's  average
   weekly earnings were more favourable to  the  respondents'  prospects  of
   success, or obliged to have regard to a shorter period, which  seemed  to
   favour more the decision of the Entry Clearance  Officer.   Both  periods
   ended at the same date, 5 April 2012.

21) I do not suppose there would be  many  appeals  in  which  it  would  be
   appropriate as a matter of fact to calculate weekly  earnings  over  a  3
   year period.  In the circumstances of this  appeal,  however,  the  judge
   decided that it was appropriate and, having heard the submissions of  the
   parties, I am not persuaded that the judge  made  any  error  of  law  in
   selecting this 3 year period.   Mr  Dewison  questioned  whether  it  was
   reasonable for the judge to take a 3 year period into account  but  I  do
   not consider that in so doing the judge made  a  decision  which  was  so
   perverse that no reasonable judge would have made it.


22) I see nothing in the approach by the Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   which falls foul of the requirements set out in KA (Pakistan) and  Yarce.
   I am not persuaded that there is an error of law in the decision  of  the
   Judge of the First-tier Tribunal such that it should be set aside.

23) Mr Brown asked me to make a direction to the Entry Clearance Officer  if
   the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was to be upheld.  I note that no
   direction was made by the First-tier Tribunal.  As I am not re-making the
   decision of the First-tier Tribunal I do not have jurisdiction to make  a
   direction, in terms  of  section  12(4)  of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and
   Enforcement Act 2007.

Conclusions

24) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve
   the making of an error on a point of law.


Anonymity

25) The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to Rule  45(4)(i)
   of the Asylum & Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
