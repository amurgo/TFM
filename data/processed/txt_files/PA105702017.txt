Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Hodson, instructed by Elder Rahimi, solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


      1. For reasons given in a determination promulgated on  29th  November
         2017, First-tier Tribunal Judge  Doyle  dismissed  the  appellant's
         appeal against the refusal of his protection claim.


      2. Permission to appeal was sought and granted on 2 grounds;



          1) It was arguable the First-tier Tribunal judge made findings of
             fact against the appellant on the incorrect standard of  proof
             namely a  balance  of  probabilities  rather  than  the  lower
             standard applicable to protection claims and that there was no
             evidence that the appellant would  be  without  minority  clan
             support.




          2) The findings of fact regarding the availability of remittances
             from the UK, that he has close relatives upon whom he can rely
             for  support  and  the  potential  of  securing  access  to  a
             livelihood were unreliable and based upon inadequate  or  lack
             of evidence  considering  his  age,  length  of  absence  from
             Somalia, lack of contact with his wife and  lack  of  previous
             employment.





         Brief history


      3. The appellant identifies as Reer Hamar, Bendabow,  Aweys  Khamiics.
         The respondent does not dispute this identification.


      4. He arrived in the UK on 28th  May  1998  and  claimed  asylum.  His
         application was refused on third country grounds; he absconded.  On
         29th February 2008, he claimed asylum  in  a  different  name.  His
         evidence is that he  has  a  mother  and  two  siblings  living  in
         Somalia, but not in Mogadishu. He had contact with his wife in July
         2017 but at the date of his hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal
         in November 2017 he said he had lost contact with her; she had been
         in Mogadishu for about 2 months, visiting her  mother  who  was  in
         hospital.


      5. He has not worked whilst in  the  UK  but  has  been  supported  by
         friends who have provided  him  with  accommodation  and  financial
         support. A witness at the First-tier Tribunal hearing said he  gave
         him about ï¿½80 per month.


      6. The findings of the First-tier Tribunal that he  does  not  have  a
         genuine fear of being persecuted by Al Shabab; has not suffered ill
         treatment at the hands of the American forces and does not  have  a
         genuine fear of  ISIS  or  the  Somali  government  have  not  been
         challenged.


         Error of law


      7. The First-tier Tribunal judge's findings in  so  far  as  they  are
         relevant to this appeal are as follows:


             "14(n)    it  is  accepted  that  the  appellant  returns   to
             Mogadishu after a long absence, but  on  the  appellant's  own
             evidence he has close relative the city.  On  the  appellant's
             own evidence, he has  lived  in  the  UK  on  the  charity  of
             friends. Those friends are in a position to send money to  the
             appellant in Mogadishu  if  he  needs  when  he's  there.  The
             appellant has  a  network  of  support  both  in  the  UK  and
             Mogadishu. The submission that was made ignores the  following
             guidance from MOJ


                   Put another way, it will be for the person facing  return
                   to explain why  he  would  not  be  able  to  access  the
                   economic opportunities that have  been  produced  by  the
                   economic boom, especially as there  is  evidence  to  the
                   effect that returnees are taking jobs at the  expense  of
                   those who have never been away; (xi) it  will  therefore,
                   only be those with no clan or family support who will not
                   be in receipt of remittances from abroad and who have  no
                   real prospect of  securing  access  to  a  livelihood  on
                   return  who  will  face  the  prospect   of   living   in
                   circumstances falling below that which is  acceptable  in
                   humanitarian protection terms;


             14(o)    The appellant is a member of  a  minority  clan,  but
             there is no reliable evidence from which I can make a  finding
             that the appellant would be entirely without clan support.  On
             the  appellant's  own  evidence,  he  has  family  support  in
             Somalia, and specifically  within  Mogadishu.  The  weight  of
             reliable evidence indicates that the appellant  is  likely  to
             receive remittances from London. There is no reliable evidence
             to indicate the appellant has no  real  prospect  of  securing
             access to a livelihood on return.  Country  guidance  and  the
             background materials  indicate  that  jobs  are  available  to
             returning  Somali's.  There  is  no  reliable  evidence  which
             indicates that the appellant cannot work."


      8. The core guidance in MOJ (return to Mogadishu)  Somalia  CG  [2014]
         UKUT 00442 (IAC) in so far as it impacts upon this appellant is  as
         follows:


             (vii)    A person returning to Mogadishu  after  a  period  of
             absence will look to his nuclear family, if he has one  living
             in the city, for assistance  in  re-establishing  himself  and
             securing a livelihood.  Although  a  returnee  may  also  seek
             assistance from his clan members who are not close  relatives,
             such help is only likely to be forthcoming for  majority  clan
             members, as minority clans may have little to offer.


             (viii)   The significance of clan membership in Mogadishu  has
             changed.  Clans  now  provide,  potentially,  social   support
             mechanisms and assist with access to  livelihoods,  performing
             less of a protection function than previously.  There  are  no
             clan militias in Mogadishu, no  clan  violence,  and  no  clan
             based  discriminatory  treatment,  even  for   minority   clan
             members.


             (ix) If it is accepted  that  a  person  facing  a  return  to
             Mogadishu after a period of absence has no nuclear  family  or
             close relatives in the city to assist him  in  re-establishing
             himself on return, there will need to be a careful  assessment
             of  all  of  the  circumstances.  These  considerations   will
             include, but are not limited to:


                  . circumstances in Mogadishu before departure;
                  . length of absence from Mogadishu;
                  . family or clan associations to call upon in Mogadishu;
                  . access to financial resources;
                  . prospects of securing  a  livelihood,  whether  that  be
                    employment or self employment;
                  . availability of remittances from abroad;
                  . means of support during the time  spent  in  the  United
                    Kingdom;
                  . why his ability to fund  the  journey  to  the  West  no
                    longer enables an appellant to secure financial  support
                    on return.


             (x)  Put another way, it will be for the person facing  return
             to explain why he would not be able  to  access  the  economic
             opportunities that have been produced by  the  economic  boom,
             especially as there is evidence to the effect  that  returnees
             are taking jobs at the expense of those who  have  never  been
             away.


             (xi) It will, therefore, only be those with no clan or  family
             support who will not be in receipt of remittances from  abroad
             and who  have  no  real  prospect  of  securing  access  to  a
             livelihood on return who will face the prospect of  living  in
             circumstances  falling  below  that  which  is  acceptable  in
             humanitarian protection terms.


      9.  The  underlying  guidance  from  MOJ  is  that   the   appellant's
         circumstances must be looked at holistically, not issue by issue.


     10. It  cannot  be  sustainably  argued  that  the  judge  applied  the
         incorrect standard of proof. Whilst it is perhaps trite to say that
         it is  difficult  to  prove  a  negative,  it  is  the  appellant's
         responsibility to provide at least some evidence that criteria  are
         not met by him.


     11. It is a fact that as a minority clan member, in the  light  of  the
         guidance in MOJ, the evidence is that there would be  some  support
         available. The appellant  did  not  put  any  evidence  forward  to
         contradict that approach. Mr Jarvis  referred  me  to  AAW  (expert
         evidence-weight) Somalia [2015] UKUT  00673  (IAC)  which  was  not
         before the First-tier Tribunal. That decision was reported  by  the
         Upper Tribunal in relation to expert evidence. It does consider the
         position of the Benadiri in Mogadishu  but  was  not  reported  for
         that. Although that decision does consider evidence in relation  to
         the Benadiri and reaches conclusions that have not been the subject
         of appeal, I have not relied upon those findings in  my  assessment
         of the question whether  there  was  an  error  in  the  First-tier
         Tribunal judge's finding regarding minority clan  support  in  this
         appeal. It cannot be an error of law or an incorrect application of
         the standard of proof for the judge to  state  that  there  was  no
         reliable evidence upon which to  depart  from  MOJ.  There  was  no
         evidence put forward.


     12. MOJ refers to family members. It is correct  that  the  appellant's
         mother and siblings are not in Mogadishu. His  wife  was  certainly
         there although the appellant's evidence was that  he  lost  contact
         with her after speaking with her in July 2017; his mother in law is
         in hospital there. The judge does not make a specific finding  that
         he does not accept that the appellant has  lost  contact  with  his
         wife but states that his wife  is  in  Mogadishu.  The  appellant's
         evidence was also that he was in internet communication with people
         in Somalia. It may of course  be  correct  that  as  an  individual
         visiting and staying with her mother the  appellant's  wife  cannot
         provide support in the sense of financial and economic support. But
         it is not a question of whether there  is  an  individual  who  can
         provide what an appellant is losing on leaving the UK  but  whether
         the existence of family members, whoever  they  are,  are  able  to
         provide assistance. That assistance can be anything from  financial
         assistance, accommodation or access to  contacts.  The  appellant's
         mother in law  is  in  hospital  in  Mogadishu.  According  to  his
         evidence she has mental health problems but there was no indication
         how serious  those  are  or  how  debilitating  they  are  or  what
         arrangements have been made for any continued stay  there,  who  is
         paying for her stay or the  whole  myriad  of  questions  that  can
         arise. There is an absence of evidence. The appellant  cannot  rely
         upon an absence of evidence to support a contention that  therefore
         there is a lack of support available. Even if the appellant's  wife
         is no longer in Mogadishu, she  was  able  to  travel  there,  stay
         there, and her mother has been supported whilst in hospital. Whilst
         it is possible that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  should  have
         provided more information for the basis of his findings, there  can
         be no doubt but that the judge  considered,  reasonably,  that  the
         appellant's wife would be able to provide some assistance to him on
         relocation there. The appellant's evidence was that  his  wife  had
         been in a refugee camp for many years. Yet from  his  evidence  she
         travelled to Mogadishu and stayed there and he gave no evidence  of
         any difficulties she had, even if he has now lost contact with her.
         That she could relocate there, even if no longer  there,  does  not
         support the appellant's contention that he would not be able to  do
         likewise. That he had been in contact with her, albeit  he  claimed
         he no longer had contact, does not undermine the finding that  some
         support would be available


     13. The appellant has been away from Mogadishu for some  25  years.  He
         has not worked since he left Mogadishu and has  been  supported  by
         friends and acquaintances. It does not appear to be his  case  that
         he cannot work and there was no evidence that he cannot  work.  For
         whatever reason, he does not work.  He  did  not  put  forward  any
         evidence that he would not be able to find employment in Mogadishu,
         in the context of the findings and guidance in MOJ. Although it was
         submitted that there was no evidence before the First-tier Tribunal
         that his friends and acquaintances would continue to support him in
         Mogadishu, there was no evidence that they would  not.  Again,  the
         absence of evidence does not support a finding that  it  would  not
         happen. The finding  by  the  judge  that  there  was  no  reliable
         evidence that they would not continue to support was a  finding  of
         fact that was open to him on the evidence before him. The  question
         of the standard of proof does not even begin to be an issue in this
         context - there was nothing to say they would, not never  mind  why
         they would not.


     14. MA (Somalia) [2010] UKSC 49 states


             "47. In our view all that the AIT were saying at para 109  was
             that, because MA had not told the truth about  his  links  and
             circumstances in Mogadishu, the  possibility  that  he  was  a
             person with connections in Mogadishu could not be excluded. In
             other words, he had not discharged the burden of  proof  which
             the AIT had correctly said rested on him. The  fact  that  the
             AIT were considering the burden of proof  is  demonstrated  by
             the last sentence of para 109: "Even though the appellant  has
             to prove only a  real  risk...we  cannot  make  the  necessary
             findings when he will not tell the truth..." (emphasis added).
             So too at para 121 .... The third sentence says:  "The  burden
             is on the appellant and he has not told the  truth  about  his
             links with Mogadishu..." Later in the paragraph, the AIT  says
             that MA has told lies: "It does diminish his  credibility  and
             makes it harder for him to prove his case" (emphasis added)."


     15. The judge in this appeal refers in paragraph 9 to the  burden  upon
         the appellant to prove his case; the judge refers repeatedly to the
         lack of evidence put forward by the appellant, characterising  that
         lack of evidence as  'reliable"  evidence.  The  use  of  the  word
         reliable does not indicate a  shift  in  the  burden  to  a  higher
         standard of proof being applied. It is reference  to  the  lack  of
         evidence  that  could,  if  it  existed,  result  in  a   different
         conclusion.


     16. The appellant has not provided any evidence that he would be unable
         to find employment or that he would not have financial support from
         those who have been supporting him for the last two decades.  There
         was no need for the judge  to  make  findings  in  connection  with
         family members or clan support in Mogadishu. Even if the  reasoning
         of the judge in connection with his wife is lacking in detail,  the
         evidence before the judge was such that his findings regarding work
         and financial remittances are sound  and  properly  and  adequately
         reasoned.


    Conclusions:


    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.


    I do not set  aside  the  decision;  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal dismissing the appeal stands.
