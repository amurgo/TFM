                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal by the appellant, who was the  appellant  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal ('FtT'). I will therefore refer to the  parties  as
    they were referred to by the FtT.

 2. The appellant appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Traynor, promulgated on 23rd March 2020,  by  which  he  dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal against  the  respondent's  refusal  of  his  asylum
    claim.

 3. In essence, the  appellant's  claims  involved  the  following  issues:
    whether, as an acknowledged Iranian national of Kurdish ethnic  origin,
    aged 17 at the date of the FtT's decision, his father had been executed
    by the Iranian authorities in around 2012, when the  appellant  was  10
    years old and 5 years before the appellant left Iran illegally, because
    of the Iranian authorities' belief that his father  had  been  involved
    with the Party of Free Life for Kurdistan ('PJAK') an armed  opposition
    group; and whether, around 5 years' later, the appellant's  mother  had
    been summoned to a police station and informed that the  appellant  was
    suspected of involvement, so she procured his escape from Iran using an
    agent.

The FtT's decision

 4. The FtT made a detailed analysis of the evidence, running from [�43] to
    [�60] of his decision.  The FtT found that the respondent had conducted
    very careful searches of all documents in the public domain, which  had
    not disclosed any evidence of the appellant's father's  execution.  The
    FtT regarded as internally  inconsistent  the  appellant's  account  of
    coming from a poor family, but at the same time, his mother was able to
    procure his exit via payment to an agent and to give the appellant $300
    and a mobile phone, prior to his departure. The FtT  also  regarded  as
    inconsistent the appellant's claim not to be in contact with his family
    for fear of endangering their safety, yet at the same time having  been
    given a mobile phone. The FtT did not regard as plausible that  if  the
    authorities  were  interested  in  the  appellant,  they   would   have
    forewarned his mother; or that his  father  would  have  been  executed
    despite having no interest in politics, at  least  to  the  appellant's
    knowledge (noting he was 10 at the time). The FtT took  the  view  that
    repetition of a consistent account by the appellant did not  amount  to
    evidence of his father's execution. The FtT also took into account that
    the appellant had travelled through  safe  countries  without  claiming
    protection.

 5. Having considered the evidence as a  whole,  the  FtT  found  that  the
    appellant's account was fabricated, and  he  had  no  genuine  fear  of
    persecution, whether well-founded or otherwise.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 6. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal which are essentially:  (1)  the
    FtT's reference to very careful searches by the respondent, as referred
    to in the respondent's decision letter, failed to consider  what  these
    detailed searches were, except the citation of a single website,  which
    itself did not purport to provide an exhaustive list of executions; (2)
    the FtT failed  to  engage  with  the  appellant's  wider  evidence  of
    disappearances  and  non-disclosure  by  the  Iranian  authorities   of
    detainees, with  only  a  small  minority  of  executions  carried  out
    publicly; (3) the FtT was unreasonable in expecting  the  appellant,  a
    minor child, to be able to adduce evidence of his  father's  execution.
    The appellant's account could and should have been assessed as  to  its
    consistency  by  reference  to  objective  evidence;  (4)   the   FtT's
    conclusion that the appellant's family's poverty was inconsistent  with
    his mother's ability  to  pay  an  agent  to  procure  his  escape  was
    irrational. The appellant had been clear that he did not know how  much
    the agent was paid or who paid for the agent's help.

 7. First-tier Tribunal Judge Murray granted permission on 23rd April 2020,
    on all grounds.

Directions in the light of Covid-19

 8. Upper Tribunal Judge Sheridan issued  directions  on  27th  June  2020,
    indicating that on his provisional view, the questions of  whether  the
    FtT had erred in law and whether his decision should be set aside could
    be resolved without a hearing. The parties  were  directed  to  provide
    further submissions and where, despite the provisional view  expressed,
    they regarded a hearing as necessary,  they  were  required  to  submit
    reasons for that view.

 9. Both parties responded, agreeing that the issues of  error  of  law  or
    whether the decision of the FtT should be set aside could  be  resolved
    on the papers.

10. I have considered the matter afresh and endorse  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Sheridan's view that the determination of the error of law and  whether
    the FtT's decision should be  set  aside  can  be  resolved  without  a
    hearing. The reason for this is that the scope of the issues is clearly
    outlined, limited to the four grounds set out; the  appellant  did  not
    give oral evidence and so the FtT's analysis itself was  based  on  the
    documentary evidence and oral submissions.  There is no suggestion that
    there are further submissions which could only be made  at  a  hearing,
    which had not been addressed in the appeal.  I therefore conclude  that
    it is in accordance with  the  overriding  objective  that  I  reach  a
    decision on the error of law and whether the FtT's decision  should  be
    set aside, on the papers.

The parties' submissions

11. The appellant was content to rely on the  grounds  of  appeal,  without
    further addition.

12. The respondent replied in relation to each of the grounds:

      1. Ground (1) - the respondent's refusal letter had  clearly  referred
         to extensive external research, as  exemplified  by  references  to
         someone of the same name as the appellant's father being  executed,
         but at too early a date; and the names  of  others  with  different
         names executed in 2012. The search was not limited to one website.

      2. Ground (2) - there was a distinction between  a  public  execution,
         and one carried out privately, but acknowledged in public  records.
         The fact that other evidence referred to by  the  appellant  quoted
         the number of executions, supported the respondent's position  that
         executions were publicly recorded.

      3. Ground (3) - the FtT was  entitled  to  expect  the  appellant,  as
         someone who had managed to travel across  Europe,  to  be  able  to
         obtain evidence of his father's execution. In any event,  this  was
         only one  aspect  of  the  FtT's  concerns  about  the  appellant's
         credibility.

      4. Ground (4) - the FtT was entitled to find as not  credible  that  a
         family of limited financial means would be unable to afford to  pay
         an agent to assist the appellant in fleeing Iran.

Discussion

13. By way of general observation, I am conscious that findings in relation
    to credibility (which go to the heart of this appeal) are often complex
    and nuanced and it is not for me to consider what I would or  not  have
    found, in lieu of the FtT's own  analysis  of  the  issues.  The  FtT's
    findings were  detailed  and  he  engaged  with  many  aspects  of  the
    evidence, but I nevertheless find that there were both elements of  the
    evidence which were not adequately resolved; and reasoning by  the  FtT
    which did amount to an error of law. I set these out below.

Grounds (1) - evidence of extensive  external  research  and  ground  (2)  -
wider external evidence said to be inconsistent with  all  executions  being
publicly recorded

14. The respondent's refusal letter includes, at [�37], the following:

         "You claim that the father was killed seven years ago ...  and  you
         left Iran five years after his death. Your  age  the  time  of  you
         claim your father was killed is 10 years of age. You left  Iran  at
         15 years of age. You have provided  no  evidence  of  the  father's
         death, extensive external research of this event  has  provided  no
         information to substantiate your  claim.  In  fact,  there  is  one
         article of an [name redacted] being  executed  in  Iran,  but  this
         occurred in 2001, before your claimed birth. There were no reported
         deaths in Iran during 2011 - 12 other than  for  rape,  murder  and
         drugs offences, there is one report of three males  being  executed
         for terrorism in October 21, 2012 that these males  have  different
         names from your father."

15. The  end  of  that  paragraph  includes  a  footnote  to  the  website:
    www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/world/html.

16.  The FtT referred at �44 to 'very careful searches of all documents  in
    the public domain,' which had not  revealed  the  appellant's  father's
    execution.  The FtT accepted the submission that all executions in Iran
    are public events and therefore in all reasonable likelihood,  had  the
    appellant's father had been executed, this  would  have  been  reported
    somewhere. On that basis, the FtT found  that  the  appellant  had  not
    established to any reasonable degree of likelihood that his father  was
    deceased or that he was killed by the Iranian authorities.

17. I accept the appellant's submission that, contrary to the  respondent's
    submissions, it is far from clear that the respondent did any more than
    search the single website referred to above.  Despite  the  generalised
    assertion about  'extensive  external  research',  no  details  of  the
    respondent's  research  about  executions,  beyond  the  website,   are
    recorded and indeed the examples cited then have the website added as a
    footnote, to denote the source material, suggesting  that  the  website
    was the source of that evidence.  Neither the FtT nor  the  respondent,
    in her submissions in response to this appeal, engage with the issue of
    whether the website purports to be an exhaustive and comprehensive list
    of all executions. The appellant's  grounds  refer  to  other  evidence
    before the FtT (specifically the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center
    ('IHRDC') report, which  had  referred  to  only  73  executions  being
    publicly announced out of 215 and there being disappearances.   As  the
    report states at page [157] of the appellant's bundle, "as many as  60%
    of executions are kept secret.....for many of those  [215]  executions,
    the government did not  release  further  information  such  as  names,
    execution dates or crimes for which they were executed."  I accept  the
    challenge that the FtT failed to explore what the respondent's searches
    were, beyond the website referred to,  when  these  searches  were  not
    specified; and failed to explain how the FtT could  be  confident  that
    the website was exhaustive or  that  all  executions  would  have  been
    publicly reported, when the other evidence referred to in the  grounds,
    which was before the FtT, suggests directly the opposite.  While  there
    is clearly a distinction between where an  execution  takes  place,  as
    opposed to  how  publicly  it  is  reported,  the  IHRDC  report  makes
    reference to executions that are kept secret,  without  the  detail  of
    names, execution dates, or  crimes  being  published.  The  distinction
    which the  respondent  seeks  to  draw  between  the  public  place  of
    execution and the public reporting of executions does not  engage  with
    the evidence such as the IHRDC report. The FtT's failure to engage with
    that evidence amounts to an error  of  law,  as  does  the  failure  to
    adequately analysis and explain the conclusion regarding the  extensive
    research  undertaken  by  the  respondent.   Both  errors  of  law  are
    material, going as they do to the heart of the appellant's claimed fear
    of persecution, namely the claimed death of his father at the hands  of
    the Iranian authorities.

Ground (3) - consideration of the appellant's ability to prove his  father's
execution

18. The FtT referred at �[44] to the fact of the appellant's father's death
    as "capable of verification and he has adduced no evidence  that  would
    support his claim and therefore what he has said is  true."   Even  the
    brief excerpt from the IHRDC  report  before  the  FtT  refers  to  the
    majority of executions (60%) being kept  secret  and  names,  dates  of
    execution and crimes remaining unpublished. While the accuracy of  that
    report needs to be  assessed,  nevertheless  the  conclusion  that  the
    appellant, a minor, could have proved his father's death, based on  the
    assumption of a comprehensive public record of executions, and  because
    the appellant has not done so, this undermines his claim, contains  the
    same material error of law as in  relation  to  grounds  (1)  and  (2),
    namely the reasoning  in  reaching  the  conclusion  that  there  is  a
    comprehensive list of all executions in Iran.

Ground (4) - implausibility between claim of limited financial means and  an
ability to pay an agent

19. The FtT's reasoning is at  �[45]  and  [46].  The  FtT  refers  to  the
    appellant  providing  "almost  no  information  concerning  his  life",
    although such comment appears to ignore the fact that the appellant  is
    a minor and his ability  to  relate  his  family  circumstance  may  be
    limited as a result. The reasoning continues:

         "On the one hand he claims that his family are  poor  yet,  on  the
         other hand, he suggests that his mother was unable to afford to pay
         an undisclosed amount of money to an agent to assist him leave Iran
         and was also able to provide him with US$300 to assist him  on  his
         way and provide him with a mobile telephone."

20. While I accept the respondent's submission that the  criticism  of  the
    plausibility of that account is only one aspect of the FtT's  concerns,
    which also included references  to  the  appellant's  claimed  lack  of
    contact with his family, nevertheless,  I  accept  the  thrust  of  the
    challenge that it was unreasonable expect the appellant, as a minor, to
    be aware of and explain how much was paid to the agent, or how this was
    funded, despite the family's limited financial means. At �[17], the FtT
    records the appellant's submission that he was not aware  of  how  much
    was paid to the agent.  Later, at �[46],  there  is  reference  to  the
    amount being 'undisclosed.' The FtT does not appear to engage with  the
    earlier recorded evidence that the  appellant  was  not  aware  of  the
    financial arrangements between the agent and his family. There was also
    no analysis of whether this lack of knowledge was consistent  with  the
    appellant's young age, namely whether he  could  be  expected  to  have
    known  about  the  financial  arrangements.  These  circumstances   and
    possible alternative explanations  for  the  ability  of  a  family  of
    limited financial means to pay an agent  (for  example  through  loans)
    were not considered or analysed when assessing the plausibility of  the
    appellant's overall account. Whilst it might have  been  that  the  FtT
    ultimately might have discounted such alternative possibilities such as
    family loans, the failure to consider the appellant's lack of knowledge
    of financial arrangements and possible alternative explanations was  in
    my view, a further material error of law.



Decision on error of law

Decision

21. For the reasons set  out  above,  there  are  material  errors  in  the
    decision of Judge Traynor and I must set it aside.   I  do  so  without
    preservation of any finding  of  fact,  so  that  the  appeal  must  be
    considered afresh.  Therefore, the appellant's appeal succeeds.

Disposal

22. With reference to paragraph 7.2  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
    Statement, given that the errors go to the heart of the  assessment  of
    the appellant's credibility, and  the  scope  of  the  necessary  fact-
    finding in remaking the decision, this is a case where,  exceptionally,
    it is appropriate that the remaking is remitted back to the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Directions to the First-tier Tribunal

23. This appeal is remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  complete
    rehearing with no preserved findings of fact.

24. The remitted appeal shall not be heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Traynor.

25. The anonymity directions continue to apply.
