                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


    1. The appellant  appeals  with  permission  a  decision  of  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Bart-Stewart  ('the  Judge')  promulgated  on  the  26
       September 2019 in which the Judge  dismissed  the  appellants  appeal
       against the refusal of the respondent  to  issue  a  residence  card,
       confirming a right of  residence  in  the  UK  pursuant  to  European
       Community law as the  extended  family  member  of  an  EEA  national
       exercising treaty rights in the UK.
    2. Following the  closure  of  Field  House  and  adjournment  of  UTIAC
       hearings outside London a direction was sent to  the  parties  on  20
       March 2020 indicating a  preliminary  view  that  the  error  of  law
       hearing was suitable for  determination  remotely  and  providing  an
       opportunity for the parties to respond. A response was  received  but
       not in the terms anticipated by the directions.  Accordingly  further
       directions were issued and sent the parties on 12 May 2020 a copy  of
       which is set out  at  Annex  A.  On  14  May  2020,  the  respondents
       representative emailed UTIAC advising that the Secretary of State did
       not wish to file any further submissions.
    3. In relation to the mode of  determination,  it  is  for  a  court  of
       tribunal to determine the method by which a case is  to  be  decided.
       Traditionally this has been by face to face hearings but there is  no
       right to such an arrangements enshrined in law.  What is a  protected
       concept is that of the interests  of  justice  and  fairness  in  the
       manner in which a case is  decided.  Some  cases  will  require  oral
       evidence or involve vulnerable parties which may  be  unsuitable  for
       remote hearings, as demonstrated by recent decisions  in  the  Family
       Courts. Error of law hearings do  not  involve  the  giving  of  oral
       evidence.  Legal representative will appear when  permitted  or  able
       and make submissions. The ability for them to continue to do  so  was
       clearly enshrine in the initial directions sent in  this  case.  Such
       submissions have been made and it is not made out there is a need for
       a remote hearing to enable the parties to say what they have  already
       communicated in writing.
    4. Considering all relevant facts, including the overriding objective, I
       find this appeal is suitable for the question of  whether  the  Judge
       made an error of law and, if  so,  whether  it  is  material  to  the
       decision to dismiss the appeal to be determined on the papers.

Background


    5. The appellant is a national of Pakistan born  on  8  March  1984.  He
       entered the United Kingdom lawfully on 17 January 2010 as a  student.
       The appellant applied on 19  May  2015  and  31  August  2018  for  a
       residence card which  was  refused  as  the  decision-maker  was  not
       satisfied the appellant had provided evidence he was dependent on the
       EEA national sponsor while the appellant lived in Pakistan. A further
       application of 12 December 2018 was refused in the impugned  decision
       challenged before the Judge.
    6. The decision maker accepted the appellant is a  relative  of  an  EEA
       national but refused the application on the  basis  it  is  said  the
       appellant had not provided adequate evidence that  he  was  dependent
       upon and/or residing with the EEA national sponsor prior to  entering
       the United Kingdom and since  entering  the  United  Kingdom  he  had
       continued to be dependent upon and/or residing with his sponsor.
    7. Having considered the  evidence,  including  having  the  benefit  of
       hearing and seeing the appellant and  his  EEA  national  sponsor  Mr
       Amjad Zia Hussain give oral evidence and be cross-examined, the Judge
       sets out findings of fact from [33] of the decision under challenge.
    8. At [34] the Judge writes:

           "34.   The appellant appears to put his case as prior dependency
                and/or  prior  membership  of  a   household   and   present
                dependency and/or membership of a  household.  The  skeleton
                argument submits the appellant's case is most likely to fall
                under  prior  dependency  and  present  membership  of   the
                sponsors household."

    9. The Judge notes the existence of an earlier decision  the  First-Tier
       Tribunal, Judge Parkes, who considered that the case in principle was
       the situation before the appellant arrived in the United Kingdom.  It
       was found the appellant was living in Pakistan and was in an extended
       household that the sponsor visited from time to  time.   It  was  not
       suggested the sponsor lived there as such as he had left Pakistan  to
       live in Holland in 1990.  The appellant had to show he was  dependent
       on the sponsor when he lived in Pakistan, which Judge Parkes did  not
       find he had done.
   10. The Judge Parkes noted that even if the sponsor was sending money  to
       Pakistan to support the large extended family living together in  the
       same house evidence will be needed to show that the sums  being  sent
       were essential for the support of the individuals concerned.  Nothing
       had been said about the circumstances of the other uncle and  whether
       he was working and the overall financial situation of  the  household
       [40]. The Judge notes that there is an affidavit from  the  uncle  in
       Pakistan and the appellant's grandmother, dated 3  August  2015,  but
       also notes the EEA national sponsor had not resided in Pakistan since
       1995 and the appellant since 2010.
   11. The Judge notes the evidence from  the  uncle  in  Pakistan  claiming
       never to have worked and to essentially oversee the entire household.
       The Judge notes the appellant has three adult siblings and  that  his
       uncle has his mother and  five  adults  sisters  with  no  supporting
       evidence all those persons are living in one household and what their
       essential living needs might be.
   12. At [43] the Judge finds there was no  supporting  evidence  that  the
       uncle in Pakistan was unable to work and had never done so  and  that
       it remained a position that there was no  documentary  evidence  that
       the appellant was financially supported by the sponsor whilst he  was
       in Pakistan.
   13. At [44] the Judge also finds the appellant did not address  an  issue
       raised in the refusal letter with regard to his named sponsor in  his
       entry clearance application and why he did not give  details  of  the
       EEA national sponsor, which was found to be particularly relevant  as
       by that date EEA national was living in  the  UK  and  the  appellant
       claims that he joined his EEA national sponsor in the UK  on  arrival
       in 2010.
   14. At [45] the Judge records finding the appellant's evidence  regarding
       his circumstances in the United  Kingdom  inconsistent  claiming  the
       appellant was unable in his evidence to adequately explain statements
       for a NatWest account and in failing to give adequate explanation for
       payments that he appears to have made to the  EEA  national  sponsor.
       The Judge records the appellant had claimed never to have  worked  in
       the UK when there was evidence that he worked for Asda for  a  period
       of time. The Judge concludes in this paragraph it  was  not  accepted
       the appellant had been financially dependent upon  the  EEA  national
       sponsor in the United Kingdom.
   15. From [46] the Judge considers the position in the alternative  as  if
       the appellant was relying upon a claim to be  a  member  of  the  EEA
       national household in the sense of living under the same  roof  of  a
       household that could be said to be that of the EEA national from  the
       time when the EEA national had such nationality. At  [47]  the  Judge
       writes:

           "47.   He gives his first address as 112 Prince  Street  Walsall
                and later 84 Merton Way Walsall. There is a  large  quantity
                of official correspondence addressed  to  the  appellant  at
                both addresses. The title deeds produced all 38  Merton  Way
                list the EEA national sponsor and his wife as the registered
                proprietors. There are also  bank  statements  for  the  EEA
                national sponsor at 112 Prince Street. Taking these at  face
                value  it  might  be  considered  that  the  appellant   has
                discharged the burden of proof that he  lives  at  the  same
                address as his uncle however as the appellant has failed  to
                show any of the permutations set out in Dauhoo I  find  that
                the appellant has failed to satisfy the  requirements  under
                the 2016 Regulations."

   16. Permission to appeal was granted by a Designated Judge of the  First-
       Tier Tribunal, the operative part of the grant being in the following
       terms:

           "The  grounds  of  appeal  submit  that  the  appellant   easily
           addressed the points made by the previous Judge as  he  had  now
           produced money transfers  showing  finances  been  sent  to  him
           directly but also via  the  uncle.   The  ground  state  it  was
           unclear why the Judge said that the  documents  from  the  Habib
           Bank did not take matters further. The finding that nothing  was
           said about the other uncle's  circumstances  was  untrue.  Other
           criticisms of the Judge are made.


           While the Judge set out the head note in Dauhoo and gave reasons
           for her decision permission to appeal  is  granted  for  reasons
           given in the grounds."



Error of law



   17. The chronology of events provided by the appellant reads:

           Appellant arrived in the UK on a student visa  December 2009


           Appellant granted further leave to remain  14 December 2013


           Appellant applies for further leave to remain  13 December 2013


           Appellant refused further leave to remain  9 June 2015


           Appellant applies for Residence Card as EFM    19 May 2015


           EFM application refused  28 October 2015


           EFM appeal heard    12 January 2018


           Decision of FTTJ Parkes dismissing the appeal  30 January 2018


           Permission to appeal refused 16 May 2018


           Appellant applies for Residence Card as EFM    31 August 2018


           EFM application refused  26 October 2018


           Appellant applies for Residence Card as EFM    13 December 2018


           EFM application refused  22 February 2018


           EFM appeal filed    8 March 2019

   18. The EFM applications  were  as  an  extended  family  member  of  the
       maternal uncle living in the United Kingdom.
   19. It is not disputed the issue in the appeal was whether the  appellant
       could demonstrate dependency in any of the four ways  illustrated  by
       the head note in Dauhoo (EEA Regulations -reg 8(2)) Mauritius  [2012]
       UKUT 79(IAC) which reads:

           "Under the scheme set out in reg 8 (2) of the Immigration
           (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006, a person can succeed
           in establishing that he or she is an "extended family member" in
           any one of four different ways, each of which requires proving a
           relevant connection both prior to arrival in the UK and in the
           UK:


           i. prior dependency and present dependency


           ii.    prior membership of a household and present membership of
           a household


           iii.   prior dependency and present membership of a household;


           iv.    prior membership of a household and present dependency.


           It is not necessary, therefore, to show prior and present
           connection in the same capacity: i.e. dependency- dependency or
           household membership-household membership ((i) or (ii) above). A
           person may also qualify if able to show (iii) or (iv)."

   20. It is not disputed the appellant had a previous appeal nor  that  the
       Judge was able to consider that appeal and the findings made  therein
       when assessing  the  merits  of  the  current  appeal.  Judge  Parkes
       specifically records that only three money  transfers  for  2008  and
       2009 was the only financial evidence before him with no  evidence  to
       externally support the claim that the EEA  national  sponsor  in  the
       United Kingdom sent the money to his older brother in Pakistan. Judge
       Parkes also noted there was no evidence as to whether the  money  was
       for  families  essential  needs  and  what  the  family's   financial
       circumstances were in Pakistan at the time. The appellant asserts  in
       the current appeal the  evidence  provided  was  geared  towards  the
       omissions and gaps in the evidence previously provided.
   21. The appellant asserts the evidence addressed the points made by Judge
       Parkes as he had now produced money transfers showing finances  being
       sent to him directly but also via the uncle in  Pakistan,  the  older
       brother of the sponsor, as is culturally acceptable  where  an  older
       male member of the family is present. The appellant  also  claims  he
       provided his uncle in Pakistan contemporaneous  diary  which  kept  a
       detailed log of the support sent  by  the  sponsor  of  the  families
       essential needs which externally confirmed the prior  dependency.  In
       relation to the evidence present, dependency or membership of the EEA
       nationals household, the appellant states evidence  was  provided  to
       show he was living with the sponsor in the United Kingdom  under  the
       sponsors roof and to answer the question of  present  dependency  and
       whether he was a member of the sponsors household.
   22. The appellant does not challenge the Judge's finding at [34] that the
       appellant was likely to fall within a category  of  prior  dependency
       and present membership of a household, but asserts  the  findings  at
       [35  -  37]  are  largely  irrelevant  as  they  discuss  the  family
       registration certificate showing a family  tree  when  it  was  never
       suggested that the sponsor lived with the appellant in  Pakistan  and
       the prior dependency in Pakistan with the issue not membership of the
       same household.
   23. The appellant challenges the Judge's finding  that  the  three  money
       transfers that were before Judge  Parkes  were  of  relatively  small
       amounts, referring to the exchange rate between the  Pakistani  rupee
       and British pound when the transfers were made some  9  to  10  years
       ago. In relation to the Habib Bank transfers it is alleged the  Judge
       erred in law when finding they were legible but did not take  matters
       further by failing to note the sum of money transferred,  dates  when
       the transfers were made, recipients, and nor given  adequate  reasons
       for why this evidence did not take matters further.
   24. The grounds refer to the fact that  in  his  Evidence  in  Chief  the
       appellant was asked by his own barrister about the  circumstances  of
       the uncle in Pakistan and  the  overall  financial  position  of  the
       household prior to the appellant's departure in which  the  appellant
       confirmed the family  received  500,000  Pakistani  rupees  from  the
       sponsor and that the uncle in Pakistan was not  working,  that  there
       was no other source of support, and further  testified  that  100,000
       Pakistani rupees had been transferred just prior to his travel to the
       United Kingdom for him specifically over and above the other  support
       provided to the family. It is asserted the Judge fails to refer to or
       consider this material. It is argued evidence as to how the money was
       divided was set out in the diary of  the  uncle  in  Pakistan,  which
       covers 2006 to 2008 at least, which it is asserted the  Judge  failed
       to give adequate consideration to.
   25. The grounds assert the Judge failed to consider essential  submission
       made by the appellant's barrister in respect of prior dependency  and
       relying upon the decision of the Court of Appeal in  KG  (Sri  Lanka)
       [2008] EWCA Civ 13 at [79] concerning the relevant time  which  prior
       dependency needs to be established. The grounds assert the  appellant
       produced evidence of extensive money transfers close to the  time  of
       entry the United Kingdom which is all he needed to show in  terms  of
       proving the issue of prior dependency in Pakistan. The  grounds  also
       refer to the fact that the sponsor  paid  the  appellant's  fees  for
       studying the University of Wolverhampton which was argued before  the
       Judge pointed to independent evidence of prior dependency.
   26. The grounds assert the Judge erred in considering  the  question  are
       present dependency when it was clearly stated that  the  position  in
       the United Kingdom was based upon membership  of  the  EEA  nationals
       household not the dependency issue. This issue was only considered at
       [47].
   27. In relation to this issue, although the grounds  of  appeal  at  [35]
       assert the Judge must have found the second limb of Dauhoo (iii)  met
       and that the appeal failed because  of  the  issue  prior  dependency
       alone, this is not at all clear from a reading of the determination.
   28. The Secretary of State in her response to the earlier  directions  of
       the Vice President UTIAC, filed on 3 April 2020, disagrees  with  the
       assertion in the grounds of appeal that the Judge did not decipher or
       understand the amount of the three money  transfers  when  the  Judge
       noted that the amounts were for �300 in 2008, and two of �400 in 2009
       which is said to be nowhere near the 500,000PKR the appellant claimed
       to have received every year. It is asserted  the  Habib  Bank  credit
       notes were addressed to the sponsor's brother  in  Pakistan  not  the
       appellant and that the findings were made  before  the  open  to  the
       Judge on the evidence in relation to these documents.
   29. The criticism of the appellant in not providing evidence covering the
       period he resided in Pakistan with or without his uncle at [8]
   30. It his written submissions dated the 16 April 2020 Mr  Biggs  asserts
       the Judge failed to properly consider the oral evidence.  It  is  not
       disputed further evidence of that nature was given by the  appellant.
       There is no contemporaneous note from Mr Saini  who  represented  the
       appellant at the hearing. A recent post grant witness statement  from
       the appellants solicitor, reads:

           'I, Urvi Shah of Vision Solicitors, in my capacity as the
           solicitor handling Mr Hamid Hussian's matter make this statement
           in support of the written submissions made in the above
           mentioned appeal and state as under:


                1. Mr Hamid Hussain is a client of Vision Solicitors who
                represents him in his immigration matters. I am the
                Solicitor who has dealt with and continue to deal with the
                matter of Mr Hussain.


                2. This appeal was heard at IAC Birmingham on 30 August
                2019. As a part of representation of Mr Hussain's appeal I
                was present during the hearing proceedings. Counsel Mr
                Parminder Saini of 12 Old Square was instructed to argue the
                appeal for the appellant and the respondent was represented
                by presenting officer Ms S. Tasnim. The appeal was heard
                before the First Tier Tribunal Judge Ms Bart-Stewart.


                3. I make this statement to support the written submissions
                made in this appeal. I state that the FTTJ has failed to
                consider the oral evidence given by the appellant and his
                sponsor at the time of the appeal hearing.


                4. In respect of paragraph 38 of the decision dated 26
                September 2019. The FTTJ states at paragraph 38 of the
                decision that "There are now 4 credit advice from Habib
                Bank. They are legible and do not take matters further."


                5. I state that during the course of the hearing, the
                counsel Mr Saini requested the FTTJ Ms Bart-Stewart and the
                presenting officer Ms S Tasnim to peruse the original
                receipts as the copies of the same as submitted in the
                Appellant's bundle at pages 62-65 might not have been
                legible. The Judge however said that the copies were legible
                in her bundle.  In any event the original receipts were
                produced to the Judge and the presenting officer for their
                perusal.


                6. During the cross examination, the presenting officer Ms S
                Tasnim asked the appellant why more receipts were not
                submitting to which the appellant replied that as these
                transactions took place few years back and once the money
                was received by his uncle, his uncle did not see it fit to
                collect and save all the receipts of money transfer.


                7. In respect of paragraph 23 of the grounds of an
                application for permission to appeal as prepared by the
                counsel Mr Saini, I state that the FTTJ has failed to
                consider the oral evidence given by the appellant and his
                sponsor in respect of appellant's uncle Mr Kazmi who lives
                in Pakistan. The appellant in his oral evidence confirmed
                that the family received 500,000 Pakistani Rupees from the
                sponsor and that there was no source of income for the
                family living in Pakistan other than the money sent by the
                sponsor.  He also confirmed that his sponsor specifically
                send money for him to travel to the UK for his studies.


                8. It is stated that the FTTJ has failed to consider the
                oral evidence given by the appellant and his sponsor at the
                time of the appeal hearing which collaborated the supporting
                documents submitted in the appellant's bundle.


           I hereby confirm that the above statement is true to the best of
           my knowledge and belief.


           Name: Ms. Urvi Shah (for and on behalf of Vision Solicitors)'

   31. The Judge noted the oral evidence given and was not required  to  set
       out verbatim each and every answer given by the appellant or other in
       their oral evidence. The Judge refers to the oral evidence from  [14]
       which was clearly taken into account together  with  the  documentary
       evidence. The issue is the weight given to that evidence  along  with
       all the other available material.
   32. The Judge was aware of the issues  raised  in  the  refusal  and  the
       appellant's submissions in  response.  The  respondent  rejected  the
       residence card for the following reasons:

           'You claim that you  were  dependent  and/or  living  with  your
           sponsor prior to your arrival in the UK but  have  not  provided
           adequate evidence to confirm this.


           As stated  within  your  representatives  covering  letter  your
           sponsor paid �300 to the University  of  Wolverhampton  in  2009
           before you came to the UK. Upon review of the evidence  provided
           it is clear that your sponsor paid a total of  �4600  after  you
           received correspondence from  the  University  of  Wolverhampton
           dated 06/07/2010 stating that you  had  not  paid  your  tuition
           fees. Your sponsor paid  the  sums  on  the  07/08/2010  in  two
           transactions at 11:20 4 PM & 11:30 5 PM when you were present in
           the UK. Therefore these transactions do not show proof  of  your
           dependency upon your sponsor before entering the UK.


           Furthermore you entered the United Kingdom on a student Visa  on
           17  January  2010.  You  have  listed  your  sponsor  with  this
           application as Mr Riaz Ahmed, which is  inconsistent  with  your
           submission that your uncle was financially supporting you during
           this period as he was not your sponsor for your student Visa.


           You have also provided MNA money transfers  dated  2008  &  2009
           showing yourself  listed  as  the  beneficiary.  However  it  is
           unclear that the payments were collected or  deposited  to  your
           bank account. Furthermore these  two  money  transfers  are  not
           continuous and do not cover the period that you were residing in
           Pakistan with or without your sponsor.


           You have also  provided  money  receipts  from  HABIB  Bank  ltd
           addressed to your eldest uncle who is your sponsor's brother. No
           birth certificates have been provided for Shah Hussain Kazim  to
           prove  this  relationship.  Only  the  birth  certificates   for
           yourself, your mother and your sponsor have been provided.


           The diary received from your uncle  with  translations  is  also
           unable to verified as this is not an official document.


           No evidence has been provided which confirms  that  you  resided
           with your sponsor in Pakistan prior to  entering  the  UK.  Your
           sponsor left Pakistan in 1990 and moved to Holland. Your sponsor
           entered the UK in 2007. No evidence has been provided  that  you
           resided with your sponsor in Holland  during  this  period.  You
           then entered the UK in 2010 which was neither  with  or  shortly
           after your sponsor had entered.


           You have provided two Pakistan identity cards for  yourself  and
           for your sponsor to evidence that you both resided  together  in
           the same household. Upon review of  the  identity  cards  it  is
           noted that they  both  contain  the  same  address  in  Pakistan
           however the identity cards were issued in 2015 and the other  in
           2016 when both you and your sponsor were residing in the UK  and
           therefore this cannot be accepted to  show  proof  of  residence
           prior to entering the UK.  Residential  certificates  have  also
           been provided however this is also dated 2016 and only  confirms
           that you lived in Pakistan at some point.


           As you have failed to effectively evidence  your  dependency  no
           further consideration has been given to the  other  requirements
           which needed to be satisfied  under  the  Regulations  including
           whether your EEA national sponsor is exercising Treaty rights as
           a qualified person.


           If you  are  able  to  supply  evidence  that  proves  you  were
           dependent upon  and/or  residing  with  your  sponsor  prior  to
           entering the United Kingdom  and  that  since  you  entered  the
           United Kingdom you have continued to be dependent upon  and,  or
           residing with them, you may submit a further application.'

   33. The appellant's reply set out  by  Mr  Saini  in  a  document  headed
       "Supplementary Grounds of Appeal" dated the 25 June 2019 at [reads:

             i. The sponsor's  payment  of  the  initial  �300  towards  the
                Appellant's   University   education   demonstrates    prior
                dependency and that there was no one else for the  Appellant
                to turn to for support in order to complete  his  education.
                The fact of the balance being paid after the Appellant  came
                to the UK does not contradict prior  dependency  but  simply
                adds to the fact that the  Appellants  dependency  continued
                after he left Pakistan and shows  a  consistent  history  of
                dependency.


            ii. The Appellant's sponsor by his student Visa may have been  a
                third party, but  financial  support  was  provided  by  the
                Sponsor which is all that  it  is  required  to  demonstrate
                prior dependency.


           iii. The MNA money transfers dated 2008 & 2009 show the Appellant
                is the beneficiary and as such it does  not  matter  whether
                the payments  were  collected  or  deposited  to  your  bank
                account. Financial support is financial support.


            iv. The Appellant will provide  further  money  transfers  other
                than those already mentioned.


             v. The  Appellant  will  provide  birth  certificate  for  Shah
                Hussain  Kazmi  to  prove  the  relationship   between   the
                relevance of the Money Received from Habib Bank ltd which is
                addressed to the Uncle (the sponsor's brother) [which  would
                logically also have the same effect for money transfers sent
                in that uncle's name].


            vi. The Uncle's diary has not been challenged by the  Respondent
                as being fabricated and  is  a  reliable  form  of  external
                evidence  corroborating  financial  support  as   the   FTTJ
                complained it did not formally have.


           vii. The Appellant will provide evidence to confirm he lived with
                the sponsor in Pakistan before 1990.


          viii. The Appellant highlights  that  the  two  Pakistan  identity
                cards for him and his sponsor shows they resided in the same
                household.


            ix. The card should not be doubted due to their being issued  in
                2015 and 2016 as they show the historical data held  by  the
                authorities and confirm the address for  both  holders  when
                they  formerly  lived  in  Pakistan.  These  confirm   prior
                membership of the same household.


             x. Again, the Residential certificates provided may  be  issued
                in 2016 however they also confirm the historical  data  held
                by the authorities and confirm the address for both  holders
                when they formerly lived in Pakistan.

   34. The Judge's assertion at [38] that the three money  transfers  naming
       the appellant as the beneficiary did not take matters further has not
       been shown to be a perverse or irrational finding as asserted in  the
       appellant's further submissions.  The  Judge  was  aware  these  were
       documents that had been previously provided but  finds  they  are  of
       small amounts. The burden was upon the appellant to prove the element
       of dependency and the assertion in the appellant's pleadings that the
       Judge should have considered the sums may have  been  significant  in
       Pakistan, even if not in  the  United  Kingdom,  does  not  establish
       arguable legal error if insufficient evidence was adduced to  support
       such a claim. There was a large extended family in Pakistan according
       to the evidence with very little being provided  to  prove  that  the
       whole family unit were dependent upon and could be supported by  such
       transfers.
   35. Whilst the appellant did not rely on the three transfers to establish
       all the money he received from his  sponsor,  claiming  in  his  oral
       evidence he did  not  have  much  documentary  evidence  of  historic
       support, all that evidence was considered by the Judge  who  was  not
       satisfied that this in itself warranted a  finding  other  than  that
       made.
   36. The further pleadings seek to raise an issue not  raised  before  the
       Judge, that in fact the payment of �300 was �3000 for the reasons set
       out in the footnote at page 3 of Mr Biggs  submissions  of  16  April
       2020. It is not made out this is not a new issue or  one  that  falls
       within the scope of the grounds of appeal identified, or  reasons  on
       which permission to appeal was sought  or  granted,  or  that  it  is
       appropriate in all the circumstances to grant permission to amend the
       grounds to raise this point. It is of note that it  was  not  claimed
       before the Judge that the payment was as is now asserted.
   37. It is not made out the Judge did not consider the  evidence  provided
       from the uncle in Pakistan or the appellant's  grandmother  and  this
       evidence was not rejected solely on the basis of  the  claim  it  was
       self-serving  as  the  Judge  specifically  notes   at   [40].    The
       grandmother declared that she is the owner of the property the family
       are living in in Pakistan and that the appellant was residing at  the
       same address. The Judge notes the affidavit is dated  3  August  2015
       and that the EEA national sponsor had not resided in  Pakistan  since
       1995 and the appellant since 2010. Such a statement cannot  therefore
       be true.
   38. Of importance at [41] is the finding of the Judge  that  although  it
       was claimed the uncle in Pakistan had never  worked  and  essentially
       oversees the entire household, that the  appellant  has  three  adult
       siblings, the uncle has his mother and five adult siblings with there
       being no supporting evidence to show the  people  all  lived  in  one
       household and what their essential living needs might be.  The  Judge
       specifically considers the diary at [42].  The  Judge's  findings  in
       relation to the weight attributed to these documents is supported  by
       adequate reasoning. It is important to read the decision as  a  whole
       to understand the Judge's concerns.
   39. The Judge was aware that the appellant's  case  was  that  the  elder
       uncle in Pakistan was the conduit through which the sponsor's support
       was provided which it is claimed was supported by the  oral  evidence
       and the uncle's declaration.  Even if this was the case the Judge was
       clearly not satisfied that the required tests to establish dependency
       by an extended family member upon the EEA national had been made out.
       The Judge was not satisfied that the evidence  established  that  the
       appellant was as claimed.
   40. The Judge's concerns are also highlighted at [44]  when  noting  that
       the appellant did not address the issue raised in the refusal  letter
       regarding the naming of a person other than the EEA national  sponsor
       as the sponsor  for  the  student  Visa.  The  Judge  notes  this  is
       particularly relevant as by that date EEA national was living in  the
       UK and that the appellant claimed he joined his EEA national  sponsor
       on arrival in 2010. Prior to the Tier 4 PBS a nominated  sponsor  was
       required for a prospective student. Such a person would have  had  to
       satisfy an Entry Clearance  Officer  of  their  connection  with  the
       prospective student  and  own  financial  and  other  standings.  The
       appellant was required to establish they could meet the  course  fees
       and maintenance requirements themselves or with the assistance of the
       nominated sponsor. It is not claimed the appellant's student Visa was
       obtained fraudulently or that he was not a genuine student indicating
       the person he  nominated  as  the  individual  with  whom  he  has  a
       financial or  other  connection,  which  was  not  the  EEA  national
       sponsor, must have been accepted as genuine.
   41. The Judge also notes inconsistencies  at  [45]  and  failure  of  the
       appellant in his evidence to provide an explanation for  payments  he
       appears to have made to the EEA  national  sponsor.  The  Judge  also
       notes the appellant claimed in his oral evidence never to have worked
       in the United Kingdom when there  was  clear  evidence  that  he  had
       worked for the supermarket Asda for a period of time.
   42.  It is clear the appellant disagrees with the Judge's  findings,  but
       the assertion of perversity is not made out.  The  appellant  is,  in
       effect, suggesting a different conclusion/outcome  that  should  have
       arisen on the evidence other than the one that the Judge felt able to
       make, attributing the weight it was considered the evidence  deserved
       having taken the whole into account, in the round. It is not made out
       the weight the Judge attribute is in any way irrational or  perverse.
       Whilst the appellant disagrees with the outcome it is  not  made  out
       findings are outside the range of those reasonably open to the  Judge
       on the evidence.

Decision

   43. There is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
       decision. The determination shall stand.

Dated the 18 May 2020

                                   ANNEX A

                               DIRECTIONS (T)


    1. On 26 September 2019 First-Tier Tribunal Judge Bart-Stewart dismissed
       the  appellant's  appeal.  Permission  to  appeal  was   granted   by
       Designated Judge of the First-tier Tribunal on 28 February 2020.
    2. On 20 March 2020, the parties were sent a copy of directions dated 18
       March 2020 issued by the Vice President of the Upper  Tribunal.  This
       provided for the above appellant, the party who sought permission  to
       appeal, to submit further submissions in support of the assertion  of
       an error of law and on the question of whether the decision should be
       set aside if an error is found no later than 2  April  2020.  Further
       directions provided the respondent with a right to serve  submissions
       in response no later than 9 April 2020 with the  appellant  having  a
       right of reply no later than 16 April 2020.
    3. What is clearly anticipated by such directions was that there will be
       a sequential opportunity for the parties to comment upon each other's
       further observations. Despite that the first document to be  received
       was that of 3 April 2020 from  the  Secretary  of  State.  The  first
       communication from the appellant was not received until 9 April  2020
       which, rather than dealing  with  the  specific  terms  of  the  Vice
       Presidents direction, applied for an adjournment claiming the hearing
       should be stayed for  a  face-to-face  hearing  after  the  Covid  19
       emergency had subsided relying upon the  letter  from  ILPA  dated  2
       April 2020 which was annexed. What  the  appellant  did  not  do  was
       provide, in addition to the ILPA letter, a copy of the reply  by  the
       President of the Upper Tribunal indicating no arguable merit  in  the
       submissions made by ILPA.
    4. There then followed further written submissions received on 16  April
       2020 from the appellant described  as  being  submissions  in  reply.
       Whilst these seek to respond to those provided by  the  Secretary  of
       State's representative they are the first detailed  submissions  made
       as to the making of an error of law and the failure  to  provide  the
       same in the first submissions deprived the Secretary  of  State  with
       the opportunity to respond to the same. This is procedurally unfair.
    5. It is therefore directed that:


       i. The Secretary of State shall, if so minded, have a right  to  file
           and serve additional submissions in response to those  filed  by
           the appellant on 16 April 2020 no later than 22 May 2020.
       ii.    The appellant shall, if so advised, have the right to file and
           serve a further reply no later than 29 May 2020.
       iii.   The matter shall be further considered by Upper Tribunal Judge
           Hanson on the papers on the first available date thereafter.
