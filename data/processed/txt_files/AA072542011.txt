Representation:

For the Appellant:      Miss McCarthy, Counsel, instructed by Paragon Law
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

         1. The Appellant, citizen of Kenya. On April 27, 2011  she  entered
            the United Kingdom and applied for asylum on May  4,  2011.  The
            respondent  refused  her  application  on  June  3,  2011  under
            paragraph 336 HC 395 and on June 7, 2011 a decision was taken to
            remove her as an illegal entrant from the United Kingdom by  way
            of directions  under  paragraphs  8-10  of  schedule  3  to  the
            Immigration Act 1971.

         2. On June 21,  2011  the  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier
            Tribunal under Section 82(1) Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
            Act 2002 (hereinafter called the  2002  Act),  as  amended.  The
            matter came before Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  M  Davies
            (hereinafter called "the FtTJ") on August 4, 2011 and he refused
            her appeal in a determination promulgated on August 10, 2011.

         3. The appellant lodged grounds  of  appeal  on  August  26,  2011.
            Permission to appeal was refused  initially  by  Upper  Tribunal
            Judge Goldstein on  September  6,  2011  and  then  following  a
            renewed appeal to the upper Tribunal  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
            Gleeson  on  January  23,  2012.   The   appellant   lodged   an
            application for judicial review and at a hearing on February  5,
            2014 and by consent the decision of Upper Tribunal  Gleeson  was
            set aside and the Court directed that the permission  to  appeal
            be re-considered afresh by the Upper Tribunal.  The  matter  was
            considered by Upper Tribunal Judge Warr on March 17, 2014 and he
            gave permission to appeal finding there were "viable  complaints
            about the extent of the reasoning in the decision".

         4. The matter came before  me  on  the  date  set  out  above.  The
            appellant was in attendance and represented by his counsel.

         5. The appellant had filed a Rule  24  response  in  which  it  was
            argued the FtTJ had given adequate reasoning for the decision.

PRELIMINARY ISSUE

         6. Miss McCarthy addressed me  on  five  matters  that  she  argued
            amounted to an error in law. For the purposes of this decision I
            will refer only to two matters because Mr McVeety conceded there
            was an error in law on those issues alone.

ERROR OF LAW ASSESSMENT

         7. Miss McCarthy argued before me that the FtTJ had failed to  give
            any reasons for rejecting the appellant's claim that she  was  a
            lesbian  despite  there  being  evidence  before  him   of   her
            relationship and the death of "C"  the  former  girlfriend.  The
            FtTJ gave no reasons why this evidence was rejected  but  simply
            found she was not a lesbian mainly because he rejected her claim
            about her former pimp, M M. The FtTJ had not had regard  to  how
            credibility should be assessed in such circumstances  and  there
            was no clear finding about  whether  the  appellant  was  now  a
            lesbian. The FtTj failed to consider the risk she could face  as
            a lesbian. In paragraph [46] he rejected her claim to have  been
            a lesbian in Kenya but went on to find that even if she was then
            there was no risk but in doing so he failed to  have  regard  to
            the content of  the  refusal  letter  and  the  report  entitled
            "Kenya: Mungiki-Abusers or abused" despite the  fact  both  were
            before the FtTJ. In dismissing a risk if she were a lesbian  the
            FtTJ failed to consider the independent evidence that was before
            him. The FtTJ also failed to consider the decision of HJ  (Iran)
            and HT (Cameroon) v SSHD [2010] UKSC 31.

         8. Mr McVeety accepted these deficiencies and agreed that there was
            a material error.

         9. The appellant's solicitors had already  indicated  that  as  the
            appellant had been unrepresented in 2011 a  bundle  of  evidence
            was required and up to five  witnesses  would  be  called.  Miss
            McCarthy invited me to remit the matter back to  the  First-tier
            tribunal for a fresh hearing. Mr McVeety did not  disagree  with
            this approach.

        10. I considered  Part  3,  Section  7.1  to  7.3  of  the  Practice
            Statement.

        11. Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement states:

      "Where under section 12(1) of the Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement
      Act 2007 (proceedings on appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal)  the  Upper
      Tribunal finds that the making of the decision concerned involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law, the Upper Tribunal may set aside
      the decision and, if it does so, must either remit  the  case  to  the
      First-tier  Tribunal  under  section  12(2)(b)(i)   or   proceed   (in
      accordance with relevant Practice Directions) to re-make the  decision
      under section 12(2)(b)(ii).


      The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to proceed  to  re-
      make the decision, instead of remitting the  case  to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:ï¿½


      a) the effect of the error has been to  deprive  a  party  before  the
         First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for that
         party's case  to  be  put  to  and  considered  by  the  First-tier
         Tribunal; or


      b) the nature  or  extent  of  any  judicial  fact  finding  which  is
         necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is
         such that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2,  it
         is appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

         Remaking rather than remitting  will  nevertheless  constitute  the
         normal approach to determining appeals where an  error  of  law  is
         found, even if some further fact finding is necessary."


        12. In light of the Practice Direction I agreed the case  should  be
            remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be reheard on all matters
            any private and family life issues that  may  now  be  relevant.
            Consideration will also have to be given to the Immigration  Act
            2014, if appropriate.

        13. I directed that the appellant's representatives serve  a  bundle
            of evidence including a paginated index  and  where  appropriate
            key passage index for any country evidence by April 16, 2015. No
            interpreter is required.

        14. The parties should ensure compliance with any directions  issued
            in  light  of  the  fact  the  Tribunal  Procedure   (First-tier
            Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014 will apply
            to this appeal from hereon.

Decision

        15. The making of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did
            involve the making of an error on a point of  law.  I  have  set
            aside the decision.

        16. The appeal is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a
            fresh appeal hearing under Section 12 of the  Tribunals,  Courts
            and Enforcement Act 2007.

        17. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
            2008  (as  amended)  the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity
            throughout these proceedings, unless and  until  a  tribunal  or
            court  directs  otherwise.  An  order  has  been  made  and   no
            application has been made to alter the position.
