Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A White instructed by J R Jones (Birmingham)
For the Respondent:    Mr J Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State although I will refer to the parties as they  were  described  in
    the First Tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on  6th  January  1990  who
    applied on 28th September 2012 for  leave  to  enter  with  a  view  to
    settlement as the spouse of Sayyar Mohammad, who is settled in the  UK.
    The application was refused on 7th November 2012.

 3.  First  Tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pacey  allowed  the  appeal  under   the
    Immigration Rules and allowed the appeal on human rights grounds.

Application for Permission to Appeal

 4. An application for permission to appeal  stated  that  the  Immigration
    Rules set out the requirements to  be  satisfied  in  Appendix  FM  and
    Appendix FM -SE.  It was  argued  the  judge  failed  to  follow  these
    requirements.  The evidence must demonstrate income  6  and  12  months
    prior to the date of application.  The judge took into account evidence
    considerably after that date.

 5. Further, as the sponsor's income could not be  assessed  in  accordance
    with the Rules the findings with regards MM and Others [2013] EWHC 1900
    (Admin), at paragraph 12, of the determination were not relevant to the
    case. As at the date of the application the income did  not  reach  the
    threshold and the income for a couple with a child were more than  that
    considered in MM.

 6. Further the Tribunal assessment had erred  in  its  assessment  of  the
    case.

 7. An application for permission to  appeal  was  granted  by  First  Tier
    Tribunal Judge Kamara in the following terms

    'the judge arguably erred in law in considering evidence which did  not
    form part of the application'.

The Hearing

 8. At the hearing Mr Richards essentially relied on the grounds of appeal.



 9. Ms White submitted that there was no child born  at  the  date  of  the
    decision of the Entry Clearance Officer and the  judge  had  mistakenly
    assessed the facts as at the date of the  hearing.  The  appellant  did
    reach the threshold for income  at  the  relevant  time.  The  document
    missing was, the judge found, not important. The documents  were  found
    by the ECO to be genuine. Even if that were wrong it was  necessary  to
    look at Article 8. It was not an absolute requirement to  set  out  the
    law and principles in relation to Article 8. The judge had  essentially
    looked at the Immigration Rules and the Article 8  findings  were  good
    enough.

10. The matter was listed for an error of law hearing.

Conclusions

11. The appellant needed to show that the sponsor earned �18,600 per  annum
    and to provide the relevant documentation.  The fact is that the  judge
    accepted that the appellant could only show salaried income  of  �8,600
    per annum whether or not the evidential  requirements  were  satisfied.
    The  judge  then  proceeded  to  consider  the  self  employed  income.
    Whatever the level  of  income  the  rules  require  with  regard  self
    employment status the accountant must be a member of an accredited body
    further to paragraph 19(g) (ii) of Appendix A of the Rules.  There  was
    no evidence that Tufail Associates Ltd who prepared  the  accounts  for
    his income as a taxi driver were members of  a  recognised  supervisory
    body as required by the Immigration Rules.

12. The judge found at paragraph 11 of his determination that the appellant
    did not comply with paragraph 19(g) (ii) of Appendix A  to  the  Rules.
    The 'de minimis' rule does not apply in these circumstances.  As stated
    in Nasim  and  others  (Raju:  reasons  not  to  follow?)  [2013]  UKUT
    00610(IAC) 'The Court's conclusion, as  set  out  in  the  judgment  of
    Stanley Burnton LJ, with whom Lewison and Maurice Kay LJJ  agreed,  was
    that there was no "near-miss" principle applicable to  the  Immigration
    Rules.  At [12] Stanley Burnton LJ pointed  out  that  the  "near-miss"
    principle contended for was not the same as the de  minimis  principle.
    He went on to say that if a departure from a rule was truly de minimis,
    the rule was considered to have been complied with'.  It is clear  that
    the rule with regards paragraph 19(g) (ii) has not been complied with.

13. Not  least  the  requirement  to  produce  evidence  with  regards  the
    accountants status is important because it verifies  the  accounts  and
    thus the income  claimed  by  the  appellant.   This  is  not  a  minor
    consideration and a rule is a rule.  As the judge states the  'he  has,
    this factor [the accountant's  letter]  apart,  substantially  met  the
    requirements of the Rules'.  However he did not meet the rules and  the
    application for permission to appeal was correct in that the judge  did
    not follow the requirements of the immigration rules. I find  that  the
    judge erred in allowing the appeal under the immigration rules on  this
    basis.

14. I do not accept the argument put forward that because the HMRC accepted
    the figures put forward by the sponsor, that  the  Secretary  of  State
    should accept them.  HMRC is not administering the  immigration  rules;
    that is the function of the respondent.

15. The judge did not follow Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate  aim)  [2014]  UKUT
    00085 (IAC) which stated

    Where an area of the rules does not have such an express mechanism, the
    approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) ([29]-[31] in particular) and Gulshan  (Article
    8 - new Rules - correct approach)  [2013]  UKUT  640  (IAC)  should  be
    followed: i.e. after applying the requirements of the  rules,  only  if
    there may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside
    them is it necessary for Article  8  purposes  to  go  on  to  consider
    whether there are compelling circumstances not sufficiently  recognised
    under them.

    The judge found that the  immigration  rules  should  not  bear  weight
    because there was no public interest in requiring  the  sponsor  to  go
    back to Pakistan.  This was  because  he  found  the  lack  of  audited
    accounts and evidence to show that the accountant was a  member  of  an
    accredited accounting body were 'de minimis'.  The  judge  appeared  to
    dismiss the immigration rules and failed to give them sufficient weight
    in the balancing exercise with regards proportionality.  As  identified
    above this is an error and a rule is a rule. Much of his reasoning  was
    based on the child who might be entitled to British citizenship but  at
    the date of the decision no child had been born to  the  appellant  and
    sponsor.  The basis of at least part of his reasoning which I find will
    have affected his findings was based on a misconception of the facts at
    the relevant date and proceeding on a misconception of the law.   As  a
    consequence he failed to identify arguably good  grounds  for  granting
    leave to remain outside the rules.

16. As such there were errors of law in addressing and  engaging  with  the
    evidence which would affect a fundamental issue of the  appeal,  and  I
    find the matter should be remitted to the First  Tier  Tribunal  for  a
    hearing de novo.  This is in relation to Article 8 only.  The  findings
    and determination in respect of the Immigration Rules should stand.


Signed                                             Date 28th May 2014
