Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr R Roberts, legal representative, Cromwell Wilkes
                    (a firm authorised by OISC to provide legal advice and
                    services)
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Specialist Appeals Team


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing her appeal against the  decision  by  an
    Entry Clearance Officer to refuse to grant her entry clearance  as  the
    spouse of a person present and settled here.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
    did not make an anonymity order, and I do not  consider  that  such  an
    order is warranted for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. On 9 May 2013 the  appellant's  then  legal  representatives,  Landmark
    Legal LLP,  submitted  an  application  on  her  behalf  to  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer in Beirut.  The covering letter, invited him to  note
    that the sponsor had two permanent part-time jobs and that evidence  of
    income and employment had been provided in relation to both jobs.  This
    evidence included six months' bank  statements  for  the  sponsor,  six
    months' wage slips of the sponsor for both of his  jobs,  letters  from
    both his sponsor's employers, an employment contract and (although  not
    referred to in the covering letter) P60s for both jobs  issued  by  the
    respective employers for the tax year ended 5 April 2013.  These showed
    that the sponsor's gross earnings for his employment  with  Accountancy
    Managers Ltd was �5,470.58 and he had gross earnings of �4,000 from his
    employment with Gold Wheel  Auto  Centre  Ltd.   Both  employments  had
    commenced in November 2012, according to the  information  provided  in
    the respective employers' letters.

 3. The appellant's solicitors also provided evidence of the sponsor's cash
    savings with Barclays  Bank  going  back  more  than  six  months,  and
    evidence of the appellant's savings in a US dollar  account  which  she
    held with a branch of Faransabank in Beirut.

 4. On 9 June 2013 an Entry Clearance Officer in Beirut  gave  his  reasons
    for refusing the application.  In order to meet the  financial  grounds
    of the Rules, her sponsor needed a gross income of at least �18,600 per
    annum.  She had  failed  to  provide  all  of  the  specified  original
    documents as evidence of her  sponsor's  employment  and  income.   The
    application  was  therefore  refused  under  paragraph  EC-P.1.1(d)  of
    Appendix M of the Immigration Rules.  The Entry Clearance  Officer  was
    also not satisfied that the relationship with her sponsor  was  genuine
    and subsisting.

 5. In the grounds of appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal,  the  appellant's
    solicitors argued that the documentation provided with the  application
    complied with Appendix FM-SE.  The sponsor had  a  total  annual  gross
    salary of �19,740 per annum from his two employments, and  in  addition
    to that he had savings.  The  ECO  failed  to  consider  carefully  the
    documents submitted in support of the application.

 6. On 7 May 2014 Mr Husain, Entry Clearance Manager, gave his reasons  for
    maintaining the decision to refuse entry clearance.  He  was  satisfied
    that the genuineness  of  the  relationship  had  been  evidenced,  and
    therefore that objection fell  away.   With  regard  to  the  financial
    requirement, the "principal and reliable source of  evidence"  had  not
    been provided, namely a HMRC P60 certificate.  The one which  had  been
    provided did not confirm that the appellant was earning on or above the
    income threshold.





The Hearing Before, the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 7. The appeal was listed for hearing in the First-tier Tribunal on 19  May
    2014.  The respondent failed to comply in a timely manner with  a  Rule
    13 notice that was sent by airmail on 13 January 2014.  Thus there  was
    no ECO bundle before the Tribunal. What appears  to  have  happened  is
    that the ECO bundle was prepared shortly before the hearing, but it did
    not reach the judge.

 8. The appeal was heard  by  Judge  Seelhoff  sitting  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  at  Richmond  Magistrates'  Court.   Mr  Ahmed   of   Counsel
    instructed by Landmark Legal LLP appeared on behalf of  the  appellant,
    and Mr Macrae, Home Office Presenting Officer, appeared  on  behalf  of
    the respondent.

 9. In his subsequent determination, the judge noted that the appellant had
    provided a large  bundle  of  documents  which  represented  copies  of
    everything that was  submitted  with  the  original  application.   But
    unfortunately it did not include a copy of a cover letter or  a  formal
    listing of the documents submitted  at  that  time.  He  also  said  in
    paragraph 8 of his determination that he has not  had  the  benefit  of
    seeing a review of the original decision.

10. The judge received oral evidence from the  sponsor.   He  set  out  his
    employment history and explained that  he  had  calculated  his  salary
    based on letters from his employers which set out what his total salary
    for each year would be.  The sponsor gave detailed evidence  about  how
    his daughter had been hospitalised for three months  after  being  born
    prematurely and then been given an overdose of calcium which had caused
    burns to her hands.  He explained that his daughter had already  had  a
    number  of  operations  as  she  could  not  move  her  hands,  and  he
    anticipated she would  need  further  surgery  in  order  to  have  the
    prospect of being able to use them in the future.  He was keen to bring
    his daughter to the UK to have the last operations here.   It  was  not
    possible for the family to  settle  in  Lebanon  because  it  was  very
    dangerous and insecure.

11. During the course of submissions, the sponsor interjected to point  out
    that he had considerable savings  at  the  date  of  application.   His
    personal savings were about �16,000, and his wife also had  savings  of
    approximately US$14,000.  The judge noted there was evidence of this in
    the appellant's bundle, and that the sponsor asserted that the original
    items had been submitted with the application but had not been returned
    by the embassy.

12. The judge's findings are  set  out  in  paragraph  17  onwards  of  his
    subsequent determination.  He referred to paragraph 13 of Appendix  FM-
    SE (in the form in which it appears in Phelan, which states the law  as
    of September  2012)  and  held  that,  applying  paragraph  13(a),  the
    appellant's income for the past six months was  equivalent  to  �18,180
    per year:

         Therefore even if that income was acceptable it falls short of  the
         amount required under the Rules.

13. The judge went on to find that there had also not been compliance  with
    paragraph 2 of Appendix FM-SE.   Although  the  sponsor's  income  from
    Accountancy Managers Ltd could be seen  on  his  bank  statements,  the
    papers that he had before him did not include copies of the  pay  slips
    for March and April  2013.   For  that  reason,  the  judge  held,  the
    appellant was not entitled to rely on those wages as a  consequence  of
    having failed to  provide  mandatory  evidence.   Furthermore,  it  was
    implicit from the requirement in paragraph 2(c)  that  for  a  salaried
    income to be admissible, that income must be paid into a bank  account.
    The sponsor's wages from Golden Wheel were paid in cash for  the  first
    four months,  and  thus  did  not  show  up  on  the  bank  statements.
    Therefore, the judge held, the sponsor was entitled  to  rely  on  such
    income for the purposes of the Rules.

14. At paragraph 23, he also noted that although the appellant had provided
    employers' letters, the letter from  Golden  Wheel  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 2(b) of Appendix FM-SE as it  did  not  state
    the total  income  received  and  so  "the  income  would  need  to  be
    disregarded for that reason".

15. The judge went on to address the topic  of  savings  available  to  the
    sponsor and the appellant.  At paragraph 24 he said he was reluctant to
    find the sponsor did not provide documents when the respondent had  not
    formally provided any  summary  of  what  they  did  provide.   Equally
    however it appeared that the sponsor and his  representatives  had  not
    kept an accurate record of what was  submitted,  as  he  had  not  been
    provided with anything that shows that they did.  Usually the burden of
    proof was on the appellant in a case like  this,  and  where  documents
    were unavailable, it seemed to him that the party who bears the  burden
    of proof was the party that ought to be penalised.

16. The judge went on to find  in  paragraph  25  that  in  any  event  the
    evidence of savings only  related  to  the  position  as  it  stood  in
    February 2013.  The applicant was obliged  to  show  that  the  balance
    relied  on  be  maintained  for  six  months  prior  to  the  date   of
    application.  The saving statements that he had  before  him  were  all
    dated  three  months  before  the  date  of  application.   He  was  in
    difficulties as more recent evidence may have been  included  with  the
    original application, but he simply could not see that from the  papers
    that he had in front of him on the appeal file.

17. The judge concluded at paragraph 26 that the appeal could  not  succeed
    under the  Rules.   The  highest  income  that  could  be  said  to  be
    demonstrated by adding all the pay slips that he had was  approximately
    �8,580 which was well short of the amount required.   The  evidence  of
    savings that he had were three months  out  of  date  at  the  date  of
    application, and did not show him the situation at the relevant date.

18. At paragraph 27 he acknowledged that this was  an  extremely  difficult
    situation that the child had  been  born  prematurely  and  had  severe
    health problems.  But this was an entry clearance matter, and therefore
    he  was  required  to  consider  the  circumstances  at  the  date   of
    application and the child had not yet been born.

19. In the course of his discussion of the alternative claim under  Article
    8, the judge noted  at  paragraph  30  there  was  nothing  illegal  in
    somebody being paid in cash for their  work,  provided  their  employer
    properly accounted for tax and issued pay slips.  He  further  observed
    as follows:

         31.  Taking into account the cash in hand income from Golden  Wheel
             which was not questioned by the respondent this  applicant  is
             close to meeting the requirements of the Rules.

         32.   The  respondent's  case  would   be   that   the   evidential
             requirements are as they are so that they can  be  certain  of
             the income at the date of application is exactly  what  it  is
             claimed to be and that it is reliable...

         37.   I  find  that  the   specific   evidence   requirements   are
             proportionate and therefore even those applicants who  do  not
             meet the formal  income  level  can  reasonably  be  asked  to
             provide comparable amounts of evidence that the respondent and
             the Tribunal can be certain that they are considering  a  true
             picture of the circumstances at the date of application.   The
             missing  evidence  (my  emphasis)  in  this  case  means   the
             appellant has not proved on a balance of probability that  the
             circumstances at the date of application were as it  has  been
             asserted.  I find that the requirement  to  produce  specified
             evidence  is  proportionate  and  therefore  the  interference
             created in this case is proportionate.

The Missing Evidence

20. The determination was promulgated on 30 May 2014.  In the meantime,  on
    20 May 2014 the appellant's solicitors had sent an urgent fax to  Judge
    Seelhoff at Richmond Magistrates'  Court.   The  fax  was  received  at
    Richmond Magistrates' Court on 21 May 2014, and was received at  Hatton
    Cross on the following day.

21. The solicitors understood from Counsel representing their  client  that
    since the Presenting Officers' Unit had failed  to  file  and  serve  a
    bundle of documents enclosing the application and  documents  submitted
    in support of the same, the court was unable to determine whether their
    client had  submitted  in  support  of  her  application  documentation
    confirming her and her sponsor's savings.  In the light of  the  above,
    their client's sponsor had managed to retrieve the following  documents
    which confirmed that he had declared his savings at the time.

22. The solicitors went on to list the documents which they were enclosing.
     These included the visa application submission receipt  dated  23  May
    2013, setting out  all  the  documents  submitted  in  support  of  the
    application;  a  letter  from  the  solicitors  to  the  British   High
    Commission dated 8 May 2013, a copy of  a  letter  from  Barclays  Bank
    dated 2 May 2013 with the sponsor's ISA statements from 1 June 2012  to
    31 May 2013 confirming the amount of savings held.

23. Therefore, the solicitors continued, on 9 May 2013 the sponsor in  fact
    had total savings of �17,575.76,  and  furthermore  the  appellant  had
    savings of just under US$15,000 in Lebanon.

24. The solicitors asked that the letter with the  attached  enclosures  be
    urgently forwarded to the judge, as the appellant wished this  evidence
    to be considered before the judge made his determination.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

25. The sponsor applied on the appellant's behalf for permission to  appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal.  He argued that the judge had made an  error  of
    law when assessing his level of income.  He referred to  the  documents
    submitted the day after the hearing, and submitted it  was  clear  that
    all the mandatory evidence was submitted with the application on 9  May
    2013.  When he worked for Golden Wheel Auto Centre,  he  received  cash
    payments for the first three months.  The Immigration Rules at the time
    of the application did not rule  out  cash  payments  as  long  as  the
    applicant provided a letter from the employer confirming cash  payments
    and the correct tax had been paid.  In this case, this was confirmed by
    his P60.

26. The judge claimed his income was short of the threshold by about  �400.
    The payment by Accountancy Managers Ltd in December 2012 was  short  by
    �50 because he took one day sick leave.  This  was  deducted  from  his
    gross salary.  That did not mean that his salary was short.  His salary
    was still �10,140 per  annum.   Everyone  took  sick  leave  which  was
    deducted from gross salary, but this did not mean his level of earnings
    had changed.

27. Even if his income was short by �400, he  showed  personal  savings  in
    excess  of  �16,000,  and  these  could  count  towards  the  financial
    requirement.  The judge had not taken this evidence into account.   His
    personal savings put him well above the financial threshold.

28. The judge wrongly claimed that the March and April 2013 pay slips  were
    missing.  He brought all the original documents with him to court,  and
    when he had offered to show them to the judge, the judge had said  that
    the pay slips were in his bundle.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

29. On 23 June 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge  Jill  Grimmett  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal.   It  was  clear  that  the  bundle  of
    documents had arrived before the determination was promulgated, but was
    only linked to the file on 20 June 2014.  She was  therefore  satisfied
    there was arguably procedural  unfairness  in  the  way  in  which  the
    Tribunal acted.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

30. At the hearing before me, I reviewed with  the  parties  the  documents
    which had been provided after the hearing, but  which  were  not  taken
    into account by the judge.  Mr  Roberts  also  developed  the  argument
    raised by the sponsor  that  the  judge  had  miscalculated  his  gross
    earnings.  Mr Walker conceded  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was vitiated by a material error of law, such that  it  should
    be set aside and remade, and I  formally  ruled  to  this  effect.   My
    reasons for finding an error of law are set out below.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

31. The version of paragraph 13(a) relied  on  by  the  judge  provides  as
    follows:

         (a)  where the person is in salaried employment in the  UK  at  the
             date of application and has been  employed  by  their  current
             employer for at least six months, their  gross  annual  income
             will be (where paragraph 13(b) does not apply) the total of:

             (i)  the gross annual salary from their employment as  it  was
                  at its lowest level in the six months prior to the date of
                  application...

32. The judge interpreted paragraph 13(a) as meaning that  he  should  pick
    out the month in which the appellant's gross salary was at  its  lowest
    level, and then multiply the figure by twelve.  Mr Roberts said he  had
    been unable to find anything which supported this approach (taking  the
    lowest month of earnings and grossing up) and Mr Walker  was  similarly
    perplexed.  However, having reviewed the current version  of  paragraph
    13(a) of Appendix FM-SE, I am satisfied that the judge's  approach  was
    correct.  What is envisaged in paragraph 13(a) is that in the period of
    six months prior to the date of application the  applicant's  level  of
    gross salary shall at least equal the level relied  upon  in  paragraph
    13(a)(i), namely the level of gross annual salary relied  upon  in  the
    application.

    Mistake of Fact

33. The judge's error lies in his assessment of what the appellant's  gross
    annual salary was in December 2012.  As acknowledged by Mr Roberts, the
    error was not the judge's fault.  The judge worked from  the  pay  slip
    issued by Accountancy Managers Ltd on 30 December 2012, which  referred
    to the appellant as having received gross pay in that month of �715.28.
     It should have said that the appellant's basic pay was �780.30, as  in
    the previous month.

34. In a letter dated 14 July 2014 his employer  confirms  that  his  gross
    salary for the month of December 2012 was �780.30, but he took one  day
    off for sick leave, and therefore a  deduction  was  processed  in  his
    December payroll.

35. The way in which this should have been reflected in the pay slip is not
    by reducing the figure given for basic pay, but by listing the day  off
    as a deduction in the  deductions  column,  and  thereby  reducing  the
    amount of net pay.  This was how it is done in the pay slip  issued  by
    Accountancy Managers Ltd for 30 March 2013, where the basic (gross) pay
    is given as �1,350, and in the deductions column the amount of  �75  is
    deducted for one day off, so as to bring the figure for net pay down to
    �1,078.28.

36. But for the error in the December 2012 pay slip, the judge  would  have
    calculated that the appellant's gross salary exceeded �18,600. As it is
    common ground that the judge made a material mistake of fact for  which
    neither the appellant nor his legal representatives was responsible, an
    error of law is made out.

    Procedural Unfairness

37. The judge went on to exclude other portions of the  sponsor's  asserted
    income from consideration.  In short, the judge took the line that  not
    only had the appellant not shown that his  calculated  income  met  the
    required  threshold  of  �18,600,  but  he   had   not   satisfactorily
    demonstrated through the provision of  specified  documents  an  actual
    gross income greater than about �8,000.

38. The judge's findings in this  regard  also  disclosed  errors  of  law,
    partly  on  procedural  fairness  grounds.   The  judge  excluded   the
    sponsor's income from Accountancy Managers Ltd in March and April  2013
    although his net income from this employment could  be  seen  from  the
    bank statements.  His reason for exclusion was that the papers  he  had
    did not include copies of the pay slips for March and April 2013.   But
    the pay slips were available for inspection, as they were  included  in
    the bundle documents served immediately after the  hearing.   So  there
    was procedural unfairness  in  these  pay  slips  being  excluded  from
    consideration.

39. The judge also excluded from  consideration  the  sponsor's  employment
    with Golden Wheel on the grounds that the letter from the employer  did
    not meet the requirements of paragraph 2(d) of Appendix FM-SE  in  that
    it did not state the total income received.  But  this  paragraph  does
    not in terms require the employer to state the total  income  received.
    What it requires the employer to do is, among other things, to  confirm
    the person's employment and gross annual salary, and  the  period  over
    which they have been or were paid the level of salary  relied  upon  in
    the application.  The employer's letter provided with  the  application
    discharged this function.

40. Finally, the judge held that the sponsor's wages from Golden Wheel  for
    the first four (he should have said "three") months should be  excluded
    as they were paid in cash, and  thus  did  not  show  up  on  the  bank
    statements.

41. The appellant's non-compliance with paragraph  2(f)  (monthly  personal
    bank statements showing that the salary has been paid into  an  account
    in the name of the person) was not fatal to the  application,  for  the
    reasons  later  canvassed  by  the  judge  in  his  discussion  of   an
    alternative claim under Article 8.  Paragraph 1(l)  of  Appendix  FM-SE
    provides as follows:

         If the applicant does not submit the documents  as  requested,  the
         caseworker  may  refuse  the  application.   Where  the   specified
         documents cannot be supplied (e.g. because they are  not  available
         in a  particular  country  or  have  been  permanently  lost),  the
         caseworker has a discretion not to apply the  requirements  of  the
         specified  documents,  or  to  request  alternative  or  additional
         information or documents be submitted by the applicant.

42. Golden Wheel flagged  up  to  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  that  the
    appellant could not meet the requirements of  paragraph  2(f)  for  the
    months of November 2012, December 2012 and January 2013 as he was  paid
    cash in hand for those months, and his salary  was  only  paid  through
    BACS from 1 February 2013 to date.  As the  respondent  had  failed  to
    comply with directions, the judge did not have the  benefit  of  seeing
    the approach taken  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  in  his  review
    statement.  If he had seen this, he  would  have  recognised  that  the
    Entry Clearance Manager was exercising evidential flexibility.  He  was
    recognising  that  P60s  were  an  alternative,  and  indeed  the  most
    reliable, source of information about the sponsor's gross annual salary
    from his two employments.  In short,  it  was  implicit  in  the  Entry
    Clearance Manager's approach that he was exercising discretion  not  to
    insist on compliance with the requirement in paragraph 2(f), which  was
    practically impossible, but to uphold the refusal of the application on
    the grounds that the appellant had not provided a P60 for  the  sponsor
    which showed that he had earned at least �18,600 in  the  previous  tax
    year.  While this was of course true, the  sponsor  could  not  provide
    P60s covering twelve months employment as he had only begun working for
    the two respective employers about  half  way  through  the  tax  year.
    Nonetheless the P60s which he could and did produce had clear probative
    value, as a reliable calculation of what the sponsor would have  earned
    over twelve months could be made from what he had earned thus  far,  as
    evidenced by the P60s.

43. Finally, there was procedural unfairness in the judge's findings on the
    savings of the appellant and the sponsor.   The  judge  excluded  these
    savings  from  consideration  under  paragraph  E-ECP.3.1(b)  primarily
    because it appeared to him that the evidence only showed the amount  of
    savings held up to February  2013.   But  in  fact  the  appellant  had
    provided up-to-date evidence with her  application,  as  shown  by  the
    documents in the bundle served after the hearing.

44. In conclusion, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is vitiated by a
    material error of law, such that it should be set aside and remade.

The Remaking of the Decision

45. I find that the decision should be remade in  the  appellant's  favour.
    The appellant has provided the specified documents  to  show  that  the
    sponsor had a specified gross annual income of at least �18,600 at  all
    material times.  Alternatively, the small shortfall of �400  calculated
    by Judge Seelhoff on the basis of the incorrect gross salary figure  in
    the December 2012 pay slip (see above) is more than compensated for  by
    the savings of the appellant and the sponsor.

46. Mr Walker accepted Mr Roberts' calculations that the total  savings  of
    the sponsor and the appellant were �27,316.   This  produces  a  target
    figure for the sponsor's  income  of  �14,058.   In  other  words,  the
    sponsor only needs to show that he was earning a gross annual salary at
    this level or above.  The shortfall of �4,542 between this  figure  and
    the required income threshold of �18,600  is  compensated  for  by  the
    savings of �27,316 which the appellant and  the  sponsor  held  for  at
    least six months prior to the date of the application.

Conclusion

47. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of law,  and
    accordingly the  decision  is  set  aside  and  following  decision  is
    substituted: the  appellant's  appeal  against  the  refusal  of  entry
    clearance as a spouse is allowed.
