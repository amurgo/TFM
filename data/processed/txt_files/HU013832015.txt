For the Appellant:     Mr J Howard of Counsel, instructed by Fountain
Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and background facts:

 1. The appellant is a national of the Philippines, born on 20 April  1977.
    A Judge of the First-tier Tribunal granted him permission to appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal against  a  decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Row who, following a hearing on 7 April  2016,  dismissed  his
    appeal against a decision of the respondent of 23  June  2015  refusing
    his application of 15 April 2015 for limited leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom as the partner of a Ms [MG] (the "Sponsor"). The sponsor
    is also a national of the Philippines, born on 9  March  1973.  She  is
    settled in the United Kingdom.

 2. The issue before the judge was whether the decision was  in  breach  of
    Article 8 of the 1950 European Convention for the Protection  of  Human
    Rights  and  Fundamental  Freedoms  (ECHR).  The  judge  dismissed  the
    application under the Rules and on human rights grounds.

 3. The appellant and the sponsor attended the hearing and  gave  evidence.
    The appellant did not have legal representation. The respondent was not
    represented at the hearing.

Background

 4. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 29 June 2008 with  entry
    clearance valid from 14 February 2008 to 23  April  2012  in  order  to
    enable him to join the sponsor.  He made  an  in-time  application  for
    limited leave to remain as a  Points  Based  System  Migrant  Dependant
    which was refused on 18 January 2012. On 25 April 2012, he made another
    application for limited leave  to  remain  as  a  Points  Based  System
    Migrant Dependant which was granted from 20 June 2012 to 14  May  2015.
    Accordingly,  his  application  of  15  April  2015  was   an   in-time
    application for extension of his leave.

 5. The appellant and the sponsor have three children. As at  the  date  of
    the hearing before the judge, the children were aged 15 years, 13 years
    and 3 years. The children lived in the Philippines until 14  June  2015
    when they arrived with settlement visas issued on 18 February  2015  in
    order to enable them to join the sponsor.

The respondent's decision

 6. The appellant's application for limited leave to remain  as  a  partner
    was refused under Section R-LTRP  of  Appendix  FM  for  the  following
    reasons:

    i)   The respondent considered  that  the  appellant  was  required  to
         demonstrate  a  gross  annual  income  of  at  least  �18,600.  The
         appellant had claimed joint earnings of �29,000, comprising of  his
         earnings  of  �14,000  from  Central  England  Healthcare  Conifers
         Nursing Home and �15,000 of the sponsor's earnings from Alpha  Care
         Home Lake View. Pursuant to paragraph 2(a)(ii) of  Appendix  FM-SE,
         the appellant was required to submit wage slips in relation to  his
         earnings and those of the sponsor covering a period  of  6  months,
         whereas the wage slips he submitted covered a period of  3  months.
         The appellant had not complied with Appendix FM-SE and therefore it
         was not accepted that the financial requirement was satisfied.

    ii)  The appellant did not satisfy the required English  language  test
         requirement.

 7. It appears that the respondent  was  not  aware  that,  in  the  period
    between the date of the appellant's application for  limited  leave  to
    remain and the date of  the  decision,  the  appellant's  children  had
    arrived in the United Kingdom. As a consequence,  she  considered  that
    the appellant did not satisfy the requirements of EX.1 (a) of  Appendix
    FM. In relation to EX.1 (b) of Appendix  FM,  the  respondent  did  not
    accept  that  there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family   life
    continuing in the Philippines. The  appellant  had  not  submitted  any
    evidence why the sponsor would be unable to accompany the appellant  to
    the Philippines and continue family life in the Philippines.

 8. The application was also  refused  under  paragraph  276ADE(1)  of  the
    Rules. The respondent did not accept that there were  very  significant
    obstacles to the appellant's  reintegration  in  the  Philippines.  She
    therefore decided that he  did  not  satisfy  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi).
    Given his age and length of residence in the United  Kingdom,  she  did
    not consider that he satisfied  the  remaining  criteria  in  paragraph
    276ADE(1).

 9. The application was refused outside the Rules  because  the  respondent
    considered  that  the  appellant  had  not   raised   any   exceptional
    circumstances which, consistent with the right to  respect  of  private
    and family life under Article 8, might warrant the grant  of  leave  to
    remain.

The judge's decision

10. As is evident from the above, the children of  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor had arrived in the United Kingdom by the date  of  the  hearing
    before the judge.

11. The grounds do not take issue with the judge's decision to dismiss  the
    appeal in relation to the requirements for limited leave to remain as a
    partner.

12. The grounds challenge the judge's assessment and findings at [19]-[36],
    the judge having  earlier  noted  (at  [16])  that  the  appellant  had
    accepted that he had not submitted the correct wage slips and that  the
    appellant had not passed the required English language test.

13. I will now quote [19]-[36] which read as follows:

             "The Welfare of the Children


         19.  In any administrative decision  involving  the  removal  of  a
             person from the United Kingdom the welfare of any child in the
             United Kingdom likely to be affected  by  the  decision  is  a
             primary,  although  not   the   primary,   nor   a   paramount
             consideration.


         20.  In this case the three children were [A], aged 15,  [B],  aged
             13, and [C] aged three. All were Philippine nationals and  had
             lived in the Philippines until June 2015. They had lived  with
             the sponsor's mother whilst the appellant and the sponsor  had
             been in the United Kingdom. The elder children attended school
             in the Philippines. The  youngest  was  too  young  to  attend
             school. All were in good health.


         21.  This is not a case where the children had lived in the  United
             Kingdom  for  many  years.  Their  life  had   been   in   the
             Philippines. I find that the best interests  of  the  children
             would be to remain with both their parents. If the parents  or
             the appellant had to return to the Philippines their  interest
             would  not  be  adversely  affected  by   returning   to   the
             Philippines. They are nationals of  that  country,  spoke  its
             languages, and had lived there most of  the  lives.  They  had
             been  supported  in  the  Philippines.  Their  parents   would
             continue to support them there. The appellant and the  sponsor
             were in good health, young, and capable of working to  support
             the family. There are numerous relatives  in  the  Philippines
             would be able to assist.


             Paragraph EX.1


         22.  The appellant could not succeed under the parent route as none
             of the children were British citizens nor  had  lived  in  the
             United Kingdom for seven years. The  appellant  could  succeed
             under the parent route if there are  insurmountable  obstacles
             to family life being continued in the Philippines.


         23.  There were no insurmountable obstacles. The appellant and  the
             sponsor were  young  and  in  good  health.  There  were  both
             nationals of the Philippines and spoke its languages. They had
             lived there until recently. They had relatives there including
             parents and brothers and sisters.


         24.  The sponsor's mother had accommodation there and had been able
             to look after the three children whilst the  sponsor  and  the
             appellant worked in the United Kingdom. The appellant and  the
             sponsor may not wish to return to the  Philippines  but  there
             were no insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life  continuing
             there. Paragraph EX.1 did not apply.


             276 ADE


         25.   The  appellant  argued  that  there  were  very   significant
             obstacles to his return to the Philippines. It would break  up
             his family life. His family  life  with  his  wife  and  three
             children could be continued in the Philippines. He  was  young
             and in good health. He had lived  most  of  his  life  in  the
             Philippines. He spoke its languages and was a national of that
             country. There were no legal or other restraints to his return
             there. There were no very significant  obstacles  which  would
             enable him to qualify under paragraph 276 ADE. He did not.


             Article 8 ECHR


         26.  I considered the matter outside of the Immigration Rules under
             Article 8 of the  ECHR.  A  situation  had  arisen  where  the
             sponsor and the three children of the marriage had  indefinite
             leave to remain in the United Kingdom  whereas  the  appellant
             did not.


         27.  I take into account that family life could be continued in the
             Philippines. There was no reason why the  appellant,  sponsor,
             and the three children should not be able to return there. The
             children would not be adversely affected.


         28.  There were other options. The appellant could return and  make
             an application for leave to enter once he  had  been  able  to
             pass the English language  test.  The  children  could  either
             remain in the United Kingdom with the sponsor or return to the
             Philippines with him. All three options were available.


         29.  The appellant knew that he had to pass  the  English  language
             test in order to be able to obtain leave  to  remain.  He  had
             been in the United Kingdom since 2008.


         30.  I take into account those matters that I must have  regard  to
             by virtue of section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration  and
             Asylum Act 2002.


         31.  It is in the public interest that the appellant should be able
             to speak English. He has not been able  to  pass  the  English
             language test.


         32.  It is in the public interest that the appellant should not  be
             a financial burden to the taxpayer. I  accept  that  the  wage
             slips now produced indicate that the appellant and sponsor had
             a combined income of  more  than  �18,600  per  annum.  He  is
             however in a low-paid job. In a family with three children  it
             is inevitable that he will become a burden upon  the  taxpayer
             especially as he has limited ability to speak English.


         33.  The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in  the
             public interest.  It  is  reasonable  for  the  respondent  to
             require the appellant to satisfy the financial and  evidential
             requirements of the Rules and provide evidence that he is able
             to speak English adequately.


         34.  The private life of the appellant has been established in  the
             United Kingdom as a  time  when  his  immigration  status  was
             precarious. I put little weight on it.


         35.  All these matters weigh heavily  against  the  appellant  when
             assessing the public interest.


         36.  Whilst I accept that the appellant has a family and/or private
             life in the United Kingdom which is  interfered  with  by  the
             decision under appeal I find the  decision  is  in  accordance
             with the  law.  I  further  find  that  such  interference  is
             necessary in a democratic society both for the economic  well-
             being of the country and for the protection of the rights  and
             freedoms of others and that the interference is  proportionate
             to these legitimate public ends on the facts of  this  appeal.
             The appellant does not succeed under Article 8 ECHR."


The grounds

14. There are six grounds, as follows:

    i)   Ground 1: In relation to the parent route in  EX.1(a),  the  judge
         erred in finding at [22] that the appellant could not succeed under
         EX.1 because the appellant's children were settled  in  the  United
         Kingdom.


    ii)  Ground 2: In relation to the  partner  route  under  EX.1(b),  the
         judge erred by failing to adequately assess whether there would  be
         'very significant difficulties' in continuing family  life  outside
         the United Kingdom which would not be overcome. At [24], the  judge
         gave no reasons for finding that there would not be  insurmountable
         obstacles to family life continuing in the Philippines.


    iii) Ground 3: In relation to paragraph 276ADE(1), the judge failed  to
         give adequate reasons for finding that  there  would  not  be  very
         significant obstacles  to  the  appellant's  reintegration  in  the
         Philippines.


    iv)  Grounds 4 and 5: In relation to  the  judge's  assessment  of  the
         Article 8 claim outside the Rules, the judge erred as follows:


         a)    (Ground  4)  The  judge's  finding  at  [32],  that  it   was
             'inevitable' that the appellant will become a burden upon  the
             taxpayer, was unreasonable and without any  evidential  basis,
             given that he accepted that the appellant and the sponsor  had
             produced wage slips showing a combined  income  of  more  than
             �18,600 per annum and he appeared to have  accepted  that  the
             appellant satisfied  the  financial  requirement  for  limited
             leave to remain.


         b)   (Ground 5): At [36], the judge failed to give any reasons  for
             finding that the decision was proportionate.


    v)   Ground 6: At [19], the judge failed to adequately assess the  best
         interests of the children.


Assessment

15. Mr Tufan  submitted  that  the  correct  threshold  for  the  financial
    requirement was �27,000, which figure includes the relevant  additional
    supplements in respect of the appellant's three children.  In  view  of
    the fact that the appellant's children had been granted entry clearance
    on 18 February 2015, at which point the Entry  Clearance  Officer  must
    have  been  satisfied  that  the  relevant  financial  requirement  was
    satisfied and the fact that the respondent stated in clear terms in the
    decision letter that the relevant threshold was � 18,600, I  considered
    that there was a potential issue as to whether the respondent should be
    permitted to raise  this  issue  at  this  stage  of  the  proceedings.
    However, I also observe that it appears that it  only  emerged  at  the
    hearing before the judge (when the respondent was not represented) that
    the children arrived in the United Kingdom in the  period  between  the
    date of the appellant's application for limited leave to remain and the
    date of the decision. Mr Tufan informed me that the respondent was  not
    aware, as at the date of the decision, that the children had arrived in
    the United Kingdom.

16. However, I do not need to decide  the  above  issue  because  Mr  Tufan
    acknowledged that it appeared that the higher threshold of �27,000  was
    satisfied, although it still  remains  the  case  that  the  evidential
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE were not satisfied.

17. Mr Howard informed me that he did not pursue ground 1. He accepted that
    the appellant could not have succeeded under EX.1 (a)  of  Appendix  FM
    before the judge because the children were living with both parents and
    therefore the sole responsibility criteria was not satisfied.

18. I heard submissions from Mr  Howard  and  Mr  Tufan  on  the  remaining
    grounds which I deal with below. Before I do so, I should also  mention
    that Mr Howard submitted that,  given  the  judge's  finding  that  the
    threshold of �18,600 in  relation  to  the  financial  requirement  was
    satisfied, the judge should have considered whether  the  decision  was
    proportionate in his assessment of Article 8 claim outside the Rules on
    the basis that the  appellant's  case  was  a  'near  miss'  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

19. I can dispose of this 'near-miss' argument as follows:

    i)   In the first place, no authority has been given for the submission
         that, in assessing Article 8 outside the Rules, judges are  obliged
         to consider whether an individual's case is a 'near-miss' under the
         Rules even if this is not raised.

    ii)  In any event, the submission ignores the fact that  the  Court  of
         Appeal said in SS (Congo) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 387  at  [55]  and
         Miah v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 261, at [21]-[26] that the 'near  miss'
         argument cannot be sustained.

    iii) Furthermore, the submission ignores the fact that not only did the
         appellant fail to satisfy the evidential requirements  of  Appendix
         FM-SE (with the result that his Article 8 claim could only  succeed
         outside the Rules if  there  were  compelling  circumstances  which
         would justify a grant of leave to remain: SS (Congo) at [51]))  but
         also that he failed to satisfy the  English  language  requirement.
         The latter was a miss  by  a  mile,  not  a  'near  miss',  on  any
         legitimate view.

20. I should also mention that I read to the parties the judge's record  of
    the oral evidence from his 'Record of Proceedings'. This shows that the
    sponsor gave evidence at the hearing that she and the appellant do  not
    have a house in the Philippines. There is no mention  of  this  in  the
    judge's decision.

21. Finally, before I  turn  to  consider  the  remaining  grounds,  it  is
    appropriate to remember that the appellant  lived  in  the  Philippines
    until 25 June 2008 when he arrived in the United Kingdom at the age  of
    31 years. His children continued to live in the  Philippines  with  the
    sponsor's mother and the appellant's sister (according to his answer to
    question 4.5 of his application). As the judge noted, the children were
    aged 15 years, 13 years and 3 years as at the date of the  hearing,  at
    which point they had lived in the UK for a period of ten months. As the
    judge  noted,  the  elder  children  had  received  education  in   the
    Philippines and all were in good health.

22. I turn to ground 2. There is simply  no  substance  in  ground  2.  The
    judge's reasons for finding that there were no insurmountable obstacles
    to family life continuing in the Philippines were not limited to  [24].
    He also gave his reasons at [22] and [23]. His reasons  were  adequate,
    in my judgment.

23. Even taking into account  the  sponsor's  evidence  that  she  and  the
    appellant do not have a house in the Philippines, the  evidence  before
    the judge was that the children had lived with the sponsor's mother and
    the appellant's sister whilst the sponsor and the appellant were in the
    United Kingdom  (according  to  his  answer  to  question  4.5  of  his
    application). There was no evidence before the judge why the  sponsor's
    mother and/or the appellant's sister could not provide  assistance  for
    such period as is necessary in order to enable the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor to secure accommodation. In any event, there  was  no  evidence
    before the judge as to why the sponsor and the appellant could  not  be
    expected to return to the  Philippines  and  secure  accommodation  for
    themselves and their children. Both have skills which they have used to
    secure employment in the United Kingdom. There was no  evidence  before
    the judge why they could not secure employment in the  Philippines  and
    provide for themselves and their children.

24. Likewise, there is no substance in ground 3.   The  reasons  the  judge
    gave at [25] for finding there were no very  significant  obstacles  to
    the appellant's reintegration in the Philippines were adequate. Indeed,
    it is very difficult to see how the  judge  could  have  arrived  at  a
    different conclusion.

25. I shall deal with ground 6 before grounds 4 and 5.

26. There is nothing in ground 6. The judge did assess the  best  interests
    of the appellant's children. His reasons were not limited  to  [19]  of
    his  decision.  He  also  gave  his  reasons  at  [20]  and  [21].   He
    specifically noted the ages of the children and the fact that they  had
    not lived in the United Kingdom for many years. Indeed, the reality  is
    that, as at the date of the hearing before the  judge,  they  had  only
    lived in the United Kingdom for ten months.

27. Although the judge did not find, in terms, that, having given weight to
    the best interests of the children as a primary consideration,  it  was
    reasonable for the children to relocate to  the  Philippines  to  enjoy
    family life with their parents, it is difficult to see how (if  he  had
    considered the point) he could have arrived  at  any  conclusion  other
    than that it was reasonable for them to relocate, given their ages, the
    fact that they had only lived in the United Kingdom for ten months  and
    the fact that they were all in good health.

28. In relation to ground 4, Mr Tufan accepted that the judge had erred  in
    finding that it was inevitable that the appellant would be a burden  on
    the taxpayer.  This  was  the  ground  which  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    considered was arguable when it granted permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.

29. I accept that the judge erred in this respect. However,  the  issue  is
    whether the error was material. The  appellant  does  not  satisfy  the
    requirements for limited leave to remain as a partner under  the  Rules
    for two reasons, as I have explained. In the first place,  he  did  not
    satisfy the evidential requirements in Appendix FM-SE  in  establishing
    the relevant threshold in relation to the financial requirement. In  SS
    (Congo), the Court of Appeal held at [51] that compelling circumstances
    must be shown where the evidential requirements are not satisfied. This
    is so notwithstanding the judge's finding that the threshold of �18,600
    was met.

30. However, even if one were to leave aside the fact that  the  evidential
    requirements in Appendix FM-SE had not been  satisfied,  the  appellant
    did not meet the English language requirement. On that basis alone,  he
    had to show that there were compelling circumstances for the  grant  of
    leave outside the Rules. The exceptionality test does not  apply  given
    that there are children involved in this  case  (SS  (Congo)  at  [32]-
    [33]).

31. I asked Mr Howard to draw my attention to the compelling  circumstances
    in this case. He drew my attention to the  fact  that  the  appellant's
    spouse and three children have  settled  status.  Mr  Howard  submitted
    that, given that the appellant does not satisfy  the  English  language
    test requirement, it  is  unlikely  that  he  would  be  granted  entry
    clearance if he were to make an application for entry clearance.

32. I  have  no  hesitation  in  rejecting  this  submission.  It  is  well
    established that the likely outcome of any entry clearance  application
    is  not  a  relevant  factor  in  assessing  an  Article  8  claim:  SB
    (Bangladesh) v SSHD [2007] EWCA Civ 28, confirmed  in  HC  (Jamaica)  v
    SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 371, and once again in SZ (Zimbabwe)  [2009]  EWCA
    590.

33. Mr Howard then drew my attention to the fact that the sponsor had  said
    that she and the appellant do not have a house in  the  Philippines.  I
    have dealt with this above. For  the  reasons  given  above,  there  is
    nothing in this point.

34. Mr Howard drew my attention to the fact that there are  three  children
    in this case who have been living in the United Kingdom. However, as at
    the date of the hearing before the judge, all three children  had  only
    lived in the United Kingdom for ten months. One was a young infant of 3
    years whose life was no doubt centred  on  his  family  life  with  his
    parents and siblings. The children are in  good  health.  It  is  quite
    simply impossible to see how, in all of the circumstances of this case,
    the judge's error can be said to be material. I am  entirely  satisfied
    that it is not. The appellant's Article 8 claim is a very weak, if  not
    tenuous, claim.

35. Mr Howard also reminded me that the appellant was  not  represented  at
    the hearing. I cannot see how this argument assists the  appellant.  He
    had the opportunity to be represented at the hearing, if he had  wished
    to obtain representation. It is not suggested that  he  was  unable  to
    give such evidence as he wished to give or call at the hearing. It  was
    not suggested before me that there is relevant evidence that  has  been
    omitted due to lack of representation such that the appellant  did  not
    have a fair hearing before the  judge.  In  my  view,  this  submission
    amounts to no more than a request for  the  appellant  to  be  given  a
    second opportunity to advance a better case  than  he  did  before  the
    judge now that he has decided to be represented. In  my  judgment,  the
    judge was fully entitled to decide the appeal on such evidence  as  was
    before him and  I  am  fully  entitled  to  decide  whether  the  judge
    materially erred in law on such evidence as was before him.

36. Finally, Mr Howard  submitted  that  there  was  insufficient  evidence
    before the judge for him  to  find  that  it  was  reasonable  for  the
    appellant and his entire family to relocate to the Philippines.   I  do
    not accept this  submission.  There  was  ample  evidence.  As  I  have
    explained above, it is difficult to see how (on  any  legitimate  view)
    the judge could have come to any conclusion  other  than  that  it  was
    reasonable to expect the appellant and his entire family to relocate to
    the Philippines to enjoy family life together, if he had considered the
    issue. They may prefer to live in the United Kingdom but I am  entirely
    satisfied that the judge did not materially err in  law  in  dismissing
    the appeal under the Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds.

The respondent's Rule 24 reply

37. The respondent had filed a reply to the grounds pursuant to Rule 24  of
    the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008   in  which  it  was
    said:

         "The respondent does not oppose  the  appellant's  application  for
         permission to appeal and invites the  Tribunal  to  set  aside  the
         determination and  remit  the  matter  to  be  heard  afresh  by  a
         differently constituted First-tier Tribunal."

38. At the commencement of the hearing, I raised the respondent's Rule  24.
    Mr Howard had not seen it. Mr Tufan kindly provided Mr Howard with  his
    own copy to peruse. I informed the parties that I wished to  hear  them
    on the question whether the judge had materially erred in law and  that
    it was my view that, notwithstanding the respondent's Rule 24 response,
    the Upper Tribunal  was  entitled  to  decide  whether  the  judge  had
    materially erred in law. It was clear  from  the  commencement  of  the
    hearing that Mr Tufan did not agree with the  author  of  the  Rule  24
    response.

39. Mr Howard  did  not  raise  any  objection  to  my  indication  at  the
    commencement of the hearing that I wished to proceed with  the  hearing
    and decide the judge had materially  erred  in  law.  He  proceeded  to
    advance his submissions. Importantly, he did not raise any issue as  to
    fairness or unfairness until, that is, I asked him whether wished to do
    so at the conclusion of the parties' submissions.

40. At that point, Mr Howard submitted that it was unfair for  me  to  have
    taken issue with whether or not the judge had materially erred in  law.
    He submitted that the Rule 24 response gave the appellant a  legitimate
    expectation that  his  appeal  would  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

41. I have no hesitation in rejecting the submission that the appellant had
    a legitimate expectation, not least because Mr Howard  was  unaware  of
    the existence of the Rule 24 until I mentioned it at  the  commencement
    of the hearing. Furthermore, Mr Howard did not pause in the proceedings
    to  inform  the  appellant.  If  the  appellant  had   understood   the
    proceedings sufficiently to understand the  contents  of  the  Rule  24
    response, he could only have had his hopes raised for  a  few  fleeting
    moments before it would also have become clear that  the  judge  wished
    nevertheless to proceed to hear the case.

42. I have no hesitation in rejecting  the  fairness  argument.  The  Upper
    Tribunal has a statutory obligation to  decide  for  itself  whether  a
    judge of the First-tier Tribunal has materially erred  in  law.  In  my
    view, the respondent's Rule  24  response  did  not  preclude  me  from
    proceeding to decide whether the judge had materially erred in law.  In
    any event, it is impossible to see how the appellant can establish that
    it was unfair to proceed with the hearing when he was  unaware  of  the
    contents of the Rule 24 response, he and Mr  Howard  were  prepared  to
    proceed with the hearing and were plainly under the impression, until I
    mentioned the Rule 24 response, that Mr Tufan wished to do so.



    Decision

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.
