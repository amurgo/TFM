Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Wass (for Sunrise Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Ms S Jones (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Mourad Chekabi, a citizen of  Algeria  born  17
       April 1970, against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  of  13
       August 2018  to  dismiss  his  appeal,  itself  brought  against  the
       Respondent's decision of 30 January 2018 to  refuse  his  application
       for entry clearance as  the  Sponsor's  spouse,  that  refusal  being
       treated as a human rights claim.

    2. The Appellant's immigration history is lengthy. He originally arrived
       in the UK and claimed asylum on 10 March 1996. His asylum application
       was refused and his subsequent appeal was dismissed.

    3. On 2 January 2010 he was arrested at Stansted airport and charged for
       using an identity document which  did  not  belong  to  him;  he  was
       subsequently sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment on 12 January 2010,
       and informed of his liability to deportation.  At  this  juncture  he
       told the authorities that he was  in  a  relationship  with  [SC],  a
       British citizen.

    4. He was released from detention on 21 July 2010 and married Mrs [C] on
       24 September 2011.

    5. On 2 September 2011, a deportation order was made against him. On  11
       December 2011 his appeal against deportation was heard by the  First-
       tier Tribunal composed of Judge Blackford and Mr Armitage. His appeal
       was allowed on private and family life grounds. He was granted  leave
       to remain, but was  arrested  on  14  February  2013  pursuant  to  a
       European arrest warrant issued in March 2005. He  was  extradited  to
       France and held in custody for  nine  months,  before  being  granted
       bail. In June 2014 he was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced  to
       a suspended sentence of five years' imprisonment.

    6. The  Appellant  then  returned  to  Algeria.  He  applied  for  entry
       clearance to return to join his wife in the UK but  that  application
       was refused on 15 December 2014, and an appeal was dismissed  in  May
       2016 by Judge Higgins, because  of  a  failure  to  supply  specified
       documents addressing the financial requirements of the Rules.

    7. The Appellant next applied for entry clearance on  28  October  2016,
       the application being refused on 25 January 2017, because of the five-
       year sentence imposed in France which was not considered spent, as  a
       "persistent offender", and for "Suitability" reasons, because of  his
       character, conduct and  associations,  due  to  the  UK  offence.  He
       appealed on 18 April 2017. Two of those grounds,  those  relating  to
       persistent offending and the mandatory ban thought to arise from  the
       French conviction, were  reversed  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager
       reviewing the decision, but the Suitability refusal was maintained.

  Previous appeal decisions

    8. It is appropriate to review  the  contents  of  the  previous  appeal
       decisions in more detail. The 2011 decision found that the  Appellant
       played a significant part in the family life  of  his  wife  and  the
       three children. Mrs [C] clearly had  a  real  aversion  to  going  to
       Algeria to live,  or  even  perhaps  to  visit.  Her  evidence  about
       witnessing a shooting and having to drive around a body on  her  only
       trip to the country appeared to be very real to her. The  Appellant's
       departure would have  a  direct  impact  on  the  well-being  of  the
       children, both because of  his  own  absence  from  their  lives  and
       because of the effect on their mother; they would  face  considerable
       disruption to their education and the rest of their lives in  the  UK
       were they forced to leave the country with  him.  The  Appellant  had
       cheated the immigration system on a  sustained  basis,  which  was  a
       factor to be  taken  very  seriously;  indeed  the  severity  of  his
       offending was highlighted by it falling  within  the  class  of  case
       liable to automatic deportation. Nevertheless, the sentence  was  low
       in the possible scale of potential punishments. There was little risk
       of the Appellant reoffending given his overall history.

    9. In the 2016 decision from  Judge  Higgins,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       found that the financial requirements under Appendix  FM  which  made
       provision for partners had not been met, as the specified evidence to
       establish the relevant earnings threshold was not provided  with  the
       application. In reality the Sponsor's  income  considerably  exceeded
       �18,600, he would be financially independent given he had  previously
       worked in the UK as a self-employed mechanic, and  he  clearly  spoke
       good English (given  his  wife  did  not  speak  French  or  Arabic).
       However, there were no very compelling circumstances as  required  by
       SS (Congo) to justify departure from the  normal  course  of  refusal
       under the Rules, whether the failure to meet the Rules was procedural
       or substantive in nature. The appropriate way  forward  would  be  to
       make a further application under the Rules.

   10. Judge Higgins accepted that Mrs [C] visited the Appellant  every  six
       to eight weeks and that her children were at that time living in  the
       family home, and thus had not begun independent  lives,  albeit  that
       they now adults aged 19 and 21; and that her belief that Algeria  was
       too dangerous a place  even  to  visit  was  heartfelt  and  genuine.
       Furthermore   documents   demonstrating   the   income   requirements
       stipulated in Appendix  FM-SE  had  been  provided  at  the  date  of
       hearing.

   11. The Judge concluded that a refusal under Rule S-EC.1.4(b) would  have
       been  incompatible  with  Article  8  ECHR,  noting  that  the  Entry
       Clearance Officer had wrongly considered the Appellant to  have  been
       excluded because of the foreign conviction, the ECO having been under
       the false impression that he had been  sentenced  to  fifteen  years'
       imprisonment by a French  court.  Once  that  sentence  fell  out  of
       consideration, reliance on SC-1.4 would  have  been  untenable  given
       that the sentence was at the bottom end of the range specified by the
       Rule, and that cohabitation was a cardinal feature of  married  life,
       and that the Appellant had already been granted  entry  clearance  of
       six months following the success of his appeal in 2011, and it  would
       have been highly likely that he would have been granted further leave
       had he not been extradited  to  France.  His  relationship  had  been
       established whilst he had been present in the UK on a long-term basis
       unlawfully, unbeknown to the Sponsor.

  The First-tier Tribunal decision now appealed

   12.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  identified  the  issues  before  it.  The
       Appellant  was  accepted  as  being  in  a  genuine  and   subsisting
       relationship with his wife with whom he had been together with  since
       the late  1990s,  the  relationship  enduring  notwithstanding  their
       separation for the last four years. He had been the stepfather of her
       now adult children (aged 23 and 25), playing an active role in  their
       lives. His  wife  clearly  earned  more  than  the  minimum  earnings
       requirements, and all her extended family lived in the UK.

   13. The Respondent had sought to raise Rule 320(7B)  but  without  giving
       any notice or complying with the requirements of the Procedure Rules:
       accordingly this application was denied.

   14. The First-tier Tribunal noted the principles set  out  in  Devaseelan
       that findings of fact should be treated  as  the  starting  point  in
       future  appeals,  though  declined  to  accept  that  this  principle
       extended to "conclusions" extending beyond such findings.  There  was
       no new evidence to justify those findings, which  accordingly  stood.
       However, it was necessary to conduct a fresh  assessment  of  private
       and family life having regard to the further passage of  time,  which
       had seen a continuation of the  strong  relationship  notwithstanding
       the difficult circumstances under which it had to be pursued,  albeit
       that the ties to the children would presumably have slightly lessened
       given their ages. More time had passed moving  the  Appellant  nearer
       the date at which his sentence would be "spent" for immigration rules
       purposes.

   15. The fundamental difficulty confronting the Appellant's appeal was the
       Suitability criteria. He had been convicted of an offence  for  which
       he had received a sentence within the relevant range, and it was  not
       a decade since that sentence  was  passed  on  him.  Accordingly  his
       appeal could succeed only if there were  "exceptional  circumstances"
       such that the public interest was outweighed by  compelling  factors.
       Even though the offence was  at  the  bottom  end  of  the  range  of
       sentences covered by the Rule, his offending related to  the  use  of
       the false documents to deceive the immigration authorities, a  matter
       going  to  the  heart  of  immigration  control.  Given  his   wife's
       understandable stance on moving to Algeria given circumstances  there
       and her own extended family in the UK, this  meant  that  they  would
       remain separated until the full 10 years had passed.  However,  there
       was  nothing  "exceptional"  about  the  case,  there  being  nothing
       particularly  compelling  in  his   relationship   with   his   adult
       stepchildren.

   16. As to the section 117B factors, the correspondence between the couple
       in  English  indicated  that  the  Appellant  satisfied  the  English
       language requirements, and it could be presumed he  would  not  be  a
       burden  on  public  funds  given  his  wife's  salary.  However,  the
       relationship was one established whilst he was here  unlawfully,  and
       thus had to be afforded little weight. Mrs [C] had not known  of  the
       Appellant's offending until long after the relationship  had  formed,
       and so this was not her fault.

  Onwards appeal to the Upper Tribunal

   17. Grounds of appeal contended that

        a) It had been irrational and unjustified to refuse to  follow  the
           findings made in the earlier Tribunal decisions of 2011 and 2016
           on Devaseelan grounds;

        b) Those findings were binding on the FTT in the  sense  recognised
           in Danaei [1997] EWCA Civ 2704 and TB (Jamaica) [2008] EWCA  Civ
           977;

        c)  Relevant  matters  had  been  overlooked,  in  particular   the
           inability of Mrs [C] to visit the Appellant in Algeria, the fact
           that Judge Higgins had dismissed the  appeal  only  because  the
           specified evidence grounds were not met (that being a conclusion
           that would not have survived the decision in MM (Lebanon)),  and
           that the deportation order had  been  successfully  appealed  on
           human rights grounds in the 2011 determination, from which Judge
           Higgins had declined to depart in the 2016 determination.

   18. The First-tier Tribunal refused permission to  appeal  on  9  October
       2018, but the Upper Tribunal granted permission on 17  January  2019,
       on the basis that all the grounds were arguable.

   19. Ms Wass submitted that the First-tier Tribunal had  materially  erred
       by failing to appreciate that the appellate findings previously  made
       were effectively binding upon it, in  so  far  as  it  identified  no
       evidence to justify departing from  them.  Whilst  the  framework  of
       Rules had moved on in recent years as domestic  policy  had  changed,
       the 2016 decision had maintained the thinking in the  2011  decision.
       This  represented  a  modern  endorsement  of  the  earlier  judicial
       response, with a full appreciation of the  relevant  public  interest
       considerations.

   20. Ms Jones submitted that any argument that the Entry Clearance Officer
       was bound by earlier First-tier Tribunal decisions should  have  been
       challenged by way of judicial review, not via  the  statutory  appeal
       process. The legal matrix had moved on and the public  interest  side
       of the balance had now been weighted in favour of immigration control
       considerations, particularly where criminal offending  was  involved.
       The findings of fact were fully reasoned and regard was  had  to  the
       family's circumstances, particularly the greater ages  of  the  adult
       children.

  Decision and reasons

   21. The Immigration Rules in so far as relevant provide:

           "Grounds on which entry clearance or leave to enter  the  United
           Kingdom is to be refused

           (7B)  where the  applicant  has  previously  breached  the  UK's
           immigration laws (and was 18 or over at the  time  of  his  most
           recent breach) by:

                (a)    Overstaying;

                (b)    breaching a condition attached to his leave;

                (c)    being an Illegal Entrant;

                (d)     using  Deception  in  an   application   for   entry
                clearance, leave to enter or remain, or in order  to  obtain
                documents from the Secretary  of  State  or  a  third  party
                required in support of the application  (whether  successful
                or not);

           ...

           S-EC.1.4.  The  exclusion  of  the  applicant  from  the  UK  is
           conducive to the public good because they have:

                (a)    been convicted of an offence for which they have been
                sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least  4  years;
                or

                (b)    been convicted of an offence for which they have been
                sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 12  months
                but less than 4 years, unless  a  period  of  10  years  has
                passed since the end of the sentence; or

                (c)    been convicted of an offence for which they have been
                sentenced to a  period  of  imprisonment  of  less  than  12
                months, unless a period of 5 years has passed since the  end
                of the sentence.

           Where this paragraph applies, unless refusal would  be  contrary
           to the Human Rights Convention or the  Convention  and  Protocol
           Relating  to  the  Status  of  Refugees,  it  will  only  be  in
           exceptional  circumstances   that   the   public   interest   in
           maintaining refusal will be outweighed by compelling factors.

           S-EC.1.5.  The  exclusion  of  the  applicant  from  the  UK  is
           conducive  to  the  public  good  because,  for   example,   the
           applicant's conduct (including convictions  which  do  not  fall
           within paragraph S-EC.1.4.), character, associations,  or  other
           reasons, make it undesirable to grant them entry clearance."

       The italicised passage was revoked by HC  309  with  effect  from  11
       January 2018.

   22. Where there has been a prior judicial determination on the issues  in
       the appeal, that assessment represents the  starting  point  for  the
       subsequent appeal as set out in Devaseelan (D  (Tamil)  [2002]  UKIAT
       00702):  in  short  the  prior  determination  is  the  authoritative
       historic resolution of the case. A Judge is entitled to take  account
       of subsequent facts,  though  they  should  treat  the  adduction  of
       further  evidence   relating   to   the   historic   situation   with
       circumspection.

   23. Devaseelan aside, there is another more  fundamental  norm  governing
       the ability of a government decision maker to act inconsistently with
       judicial decisions emanating from  proceedings  to  which  they  were
       party. In Danaei Simon Brown LJ concluded that the  circumstances  in
       which the Secretary of State could  depart  from  the  ruling  of  an
       independent Tribunal in only limited circumstances.

           "On an issue such as this it does not seem to me reasonable  for
           the  Secretary  of  State  to  disagree  with  the   independent
           adjudicator who has heard all the evidence unless only:

           1.     the   adjudicator's   factual   conclusion   was   itself
           demonstrably flawed, as irrational or for failing to have regard
           to material considerations or for having  regard  to  immaterial
           ones - none of which is suggested here;

           2.    fresh material has since become available to the Secretary
           of State such as could  have  realistically  have  affected  the
           adjudicator's finding - this too was a matter we  considered  in
           Powergen;

           3.    arguably, if the adjudicator has decided the appeal purely
           on the documents, or if, despite having heard oral evidence, his
           findings of fact owe nothing whatever to any assessment  of  the
           witnesses."

   24. Stanley Burnton LJ in TB (Jamaica) [2008] EWCA Civ 977 concluded:

           "33.  The principle that the decision of the Tribunal is binding
           on the parties, and in particular on  the  Home  Secretary,  has
           been consistently upheld by the Courts. In  R  (Mersin)  v  Home
           Secretary [2000] EWHC Admin 348, Elias J said:

                'In my opinion there is a clear duty  on  the  Secretary  of
                State to give effect to the Special Adjudicator's  decision.
                Even if he can refuse to do  so  in  the  event  of  changed
                circumstances or because there is another country  to  which
                the applicant can be sent, there is still a duty unless  and
                until that situation arises. It would wholly  undermine  the
                rule of law if he could simply  ignore  the  ruling  of  the
                Special Adjudicator without appealing  it,  and  indeed  Mr.
                Catchpole [counsel for the Home Secretary] does not  suggest
                that he can. Nor in my opinion could he  deliberately  delay
                giving effect to the ruling in the hope that something might
                turn up to justify not implementing it. In my judgment, once
                the  adjudicator  had  determined  the  application  in  the
                applicant's favour, the applicant had a right to be  granted
                refugee status, at least unless and until there was a change
                in the position.'

           34.   In R (Boafo) v Home Secretary [2002] EWCA  Civ,  [2002]  1
           WLR 44, Auld LJ said at [26] in a judgment with which the  other
           members of the  Court  of  Appeal  agreed,  "...  an  unappealed
           decision of an adjudicator is binding  on  the  parties."  In  R
           (Saribal) v Home Secretary [2002] EWHC 1542 (Admin), [2002] INLR
           596, Moses J said:

                '17.  The  decision  in  ex  parte  Boafo  demonstrates   an
                important principle at the heart of these  proceedings.  The
                Secretary  of  State  is  not  entitled  to  disregard   the
                determination of the IAT and refuse a  claimant's  right  to
                indefinite leave to remain as a refugee unless  he  can  set
                aside that determination by appropriate procedure founded on
                appropriate evidence.'

           35.   Of course, different considerations may apply where  there
           is relevant fresh evidence that was not available at the date of
           the hearing, or a change in the law, and the  principle  has  no
           application where there is a change in  circumstances  or  there
           are new events after the date of the decision ...

   25. As summarised above, the First-tier Tribunal essentially  found  that
       it was not disproportionate to the  Appellant's  private  and  family
       life to  maintain  the  ban  on  his  return  to  the  UK  for  which
       Immigration Rule S-EC.1.4 provides. As he  was  convicted  of  on  12
       January 2010, the normal ban on his return would run until 12 January
       2020. The Tribunal was clearly aware of the different decisions  made
       by earlier Tribunals, but considered itself entitled to  depart  from
       them because of the passage of time.

   26. The live question on this appeal is whether the  First-tier  Tribunal
       was effectively bound by the earlier judicial decisions to find  that
       the Appellant's continued exclusion from the UK was disproportionate.



   27. I do not consider that it was so bound, for the reasons that follow.

   28. The  Appellant  draws  attention  to  two  norms  identified  in  the
       authorities, respectively epitomised by Devaseelan on the  one  hand,
       and by TB (Jamaica) and Danaei on the other. The former addresses the
       appropriate response of a judicial decision maker to findings made by
       a predecessor (typically of coordinate jurisdiction), and the  latter
       addresses the circumstances in which a government department may  act
       inconsistently with the outcome of proceedings  to  which  they  were
       party.

   29. The right of appeal is given on the basis that the Secretary of State
       has decided to refuse a human  rights  claim  (section  82(1)(b)  NIA
       2002) and the relevant ground  of  appeal  here  was  that  that  the
       decision against which the appeal  was  brought  was  unlawful  under
       section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (section 84(2) NIA 2002).  The
       relevant human rights claim here was that  the  immigration  decision
       appealed against was disproportionate to the private and family  life
       with which it interfered.

   30. The job of the First-tier Tribunal when faced with an appeal on human
       rights grounds is  to  determine  whether  the  present  decision  is
       inconsistent with the Human  Rights  Convention.  No  doubt  historic
       credibility findings should not be departed from absent good  reason,
       but  the  compatibility  of  a  decision  based   on   human   rights
       considerations must assess  the  present  circumstances  against  the
       present public interest. As Sedley LJ put it in AG  (Eritrea)  [2007]
       EWCA Civ 801, the balance is a labile one, i.e. one in  which  either
       side of the scales may be weighted differently according  to  factors
       that may change over time.

   31.  The  statutory  framework  also  indicates  that  the  question   of
       proportionality must be assessed at the date of the  appeal  hearing,
       see section 85(4) of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act  2002
       providing that:

           "(4)  On an appeal under section 82(1) against  a  decision  the
           Tribunal may consider any matter which it thinks relevant to the
           substance of the decision, including a matter arising after  the
           date of the decision."

   32. Devaseelan explains  the  approach  to  be  taken  to  prior  factual
       findings of an appeal. That case  arose  in  the  context  of  asylum
       claims where an Article 3 case was subsequently  brought  on  similar
       facts, though understandably the principles therein have been seen as
       bearing on all immigration appeals  where  claims  based  on  similar
       facts require re-assessment, whether that arises in  the  context  of
       the same legal enquiry or not. The important passages are  introduced
       thus �38:

           "The second Adjudicator must, however be  careful  to  recognise
           that the issue before him is not the issue that was  before  the
           first Adjudicator. In  particular,  time  has  passed;  and  the
           situation at the time of the second Adjudicator's  determination
           may  be  shown  to  be  different  from  that   which   obtained
           previously."

   33. So Devaseelan clearly recognises the possibility that the passage  of
       time may change  the  outcome  of  an  appeal,  notwithstanding  that
       similar factual terrain underlies those  consecutive  determinations.
       The critical sub-paragraphs �39-42 which  lay  down  the  well  known
       Devaseelan principles (themselves numbered (1)-(8)) thus lay emphasis
       principally  on  factual  findings.  Those  findings  may  be  highly
       relevant to  any  future  enquiry  into  the  proportionality  of  an
       immigration decision; but they are not dispositive of it.

   34. Turning to the other line of authority, TB (Jamaica) and  Danaei  are
       quite  expressly  decisions  which  recognise  the  possibility  that
       "changed circumstances" or "fresh material" might  entitle  a  future
       decision maker to act otherwise than the result of a previous  appeal
       might indicate.

   35. Here there  were  several  new  factors  present,  ranging  from  the
       maturity of the Sponsor's children (which decreased the force of  the
       family life in play) to the changes in government policy expressed in
       statute and Rule that had entered force over time. For  example,  the
       section 117B factors took effect only from 28  July  2014,  and  they
       include express provision that  ties  established  during  precarious
       residence are to receive little weight. Rule S-EC.1.4 is part of  the
       codification of private and  family  life  considerations  that  took
       effect via the  July  2012  reforms  including  the  introduction  of
       Appendix FM; as has been explained in subsequent cases,  particularly
       Hesham Ali [2016] UKSC 60  and  MM  (Lebanon)  [2017]  UKSC  10,  the
       government is entitled to lay down policies seeking to provide for  a
       consistent approach to the determination of private and  family  life
       claims, and a migrant who falls outside  the  Rules  effecting  those
       policies must demonstrate a "compelling" claim.

   36. When the First-tier Tribunal allowed the appeal in 2011,  it  did  so
       expressly  in  the  context  of  its  finding  that  the  Appellant's
       appalling immigration history (as to which the sentencing  judge  and
       the Tribunal both agreed) was outweighed by his involvement with  the
       upbringing of his partner's two young  children.  This  was  not  the
       situation prevailing in August 2018. In fact it is difficult  to  see
       how it could have been the case in 2016 when Judge Higgins confronted
       the appeal, a matter to which I shall shortly return.

   37. Rule S-EC.1.4.(b) within Appendix FM was not part of the  Immigration
       Rules when the appeal was heard and allowed in  2011.  However,  when
       Judge Higgins came to consider the appeal in 2016, it was part of the
       relevant legal framework, and thus was relevant to his  finding  that
       it would be disproportionate to the Appellant's Article 8 rights  for
       that Rule to be enforced against him, given the success of his appeal
       in 2011, which would have put him on a track by which  further  leave
       to remain was granted.

   38. However, Judge Higgins's findings were necessarily  obiter,  made  in
       the context of dismissing the appeal, and in any event did  not  take
       account of the changes in the legal environment to which I have drawn
       attention; Tribunals at that time did not have  the  benefit  of  the
       line of Supreme Court authority mentioned above that  recognised  the
       need for a "compelling" claim to justify departure  from  the  normal
       consequences of the Rules. Had those findings been challenged  by  an
       appeal to the Upper Tribunal, this might well have been detected; but
       as the Secretary of State had succeeded in defending the decision, no
       such challenge was brought. So although one can doubtless state  with
       confidence that in  general  the  Secretary  of  State's  failure  to
       challenge a decision on proportionality on a particular set of  facts
       means that government officials are effectively estopped from  making
       future decisions inconsistent with the outcome of an appeal to  which
       the Home Office was party, I do  not  consider  that  that  principle
       applies here.

   39. Accordingly neither the ground of appeal based on Devaseelan not that
       which relies upon TB (Jamaica) and Danaei can succeed.

   40. The third ground of appeal as I have summarised it  above  challenges
       the conclusions of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  failure  to  take
       account of relevant considerations.  I  do  not  consider  that  that
       argument is made  out.  Firstly,  there  was  significantly  more  to
       analyse in relation to the Judge Higgins  decision  than  simply  the
       recognition in MM (Lebanon) that  cases  could  succeed  outside  the
       Rules  based  on  a  broader  approach  to  calculating  whether  the
       available funds met the relevant financial requirements,  as  I  have
       sought to explain above. And there was more to consider vis-�-vis the
       2011 decision too, again as I have addressed already.  Secondly,  the
       inability of his spouse to visit him in Algeria did not preclude  the
       possibility that they might meet in  a  third  country,  nor  did  it
       prevent them keeping in touch via modern means of communication,  and
       it was, of course, the normal course of events given the ten-year ban
       on return. The Judge clearly considered  whether  there  were  family
       ties here that warranted departure  from  that  starting  point,  but
       concluded there were not. That was a finding to  which  the  Tribunal
       was fully entitled to come.

   41. I accordingly find that the First-tier Tribunal was entitled to  make
       the findings that it did, and that its decision that  the  appeal  is
       dismissed should stand.

  Decision:

       The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no material error of
       law.

       The appeal is dismissed.
