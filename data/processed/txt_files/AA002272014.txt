                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

Appellant:    Mr S McTaggart (of Counsel)  instructed  by  RP  Crawford  and
                  Company Solicitors

Respondent:            Mr Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. By a decision made on 10 December  2013,  the  Respondent  refused  the
    Appellant's combined claims for refugee  status  and  under  Article  8
    ECHR.  The ensuing appeal to the First-tier Tribunal  (the  "FtT")  was
    dismissed.

 2. Upon the hearing of the appeal to this Tribunal,  it  was  conceded  on
    behalf of the Respondent that the decision of the FtT  is  vitiated  by
    material errors of law.   This concession was based on the contents  of
    paragraphs 16, 20 and 27 of the determination  and,  specifically,  the
    following matters:

    (a)  The unparticularised and unexplained reference to  the  "histories
         and   general   inconsistencies"   of   the   Appellant   and   his
         partner/spouse, in [16].

    (b)  The unparticularised and unexplained  finding  in  [16]  that  the
         aforementioned persons at no time underwent a marriage ceremony.

    (c)  The lack of specificity and definition in the  bare  finding  that
         these two persons are "in a relationship".

    (d)  The egregious failure in [20] to consider the relevant  provisions
         of the Immigration Rules,  to  make  appropriate  findings  and  to
         supply supporting reasons for such findings, in the  context  of  a
         bare statement "I am not satisfied that the Appellant can meet  any
         of the requirements of the Immigration Rules".

    (e)  The equally egregious error of fact in [27] of the  determination,
         where there is a reference to  "the  robust  good  health"  of  the
         Appellant, the mother "and her children".  This  is  confounded  by
         the ample and cogent evidence,  uncontested  at  any  time  by  the
         Respondent, that the second of the  children  suffers  from  Down's
         Syndrome and related infirmities.  This  error  undermines  fatally
         the  Judge's  conclusions  that  the  Immigration  Rules  were  not
         satisfied and that the impugned decision does not infringe  Article
         8 ECHR rights.

 3. To the above I would add the following:

    (a)  In [17] of the determination,  which  is  one  of  the  paragraphs
         arranged under the banner "Credibility  and  Findings",  the  Judge
         rehearses various pieces of evidence, without making any  findings.



    (b)  The omnibus, but unparticularised and  unreasoned,  conclusion  in
         [21] that the Appellant "...  has not provided any  credible  basis
         for challenging the assertions, analyses  and  conclusions  in  the
         Respondent's of refusal letters [sic] ...........".

    (c)  In [22], the Judge repeats the "inconsistencies and implausibility
         in his story" assessment - again, unparticularised and  unreasoned.
         The same analysis applies to the ensuing  conclusionary  statements
         in the same paragraph.

DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 4. I decide and direct as follows:

    (a)  The decision of the FtT is set aside.

    (b)  The case is remitted to a  differently  constituted  FtT  for  the
         purpose of remaking the decision.

    (c)  The Appellant's solicitors will file  and  serve  a  comprehensive
         appeal bundle and skeleton argument by 31 January 2015 at latest.

         (d)  The  case  will  be  relisted  on  the  first  available  date
thereafter.

    (e)  The findings rehearsed in [14] and [15] of the  FtT  determination
         are preserved, viz:

            i) The Appellant is the biological father of the two children of
               the family unit..


           ii) The Appellant, Mrs O and the two children constitute a family
               unit.

    I record, in passing, that the first of  these  findings  was  formally
    conceded on behalf of the Respondent at the hearing.

 5. A CMR is unlikely to be required.  A  time  allocation  of  1  ï¿½  hours
    should be adequate.
