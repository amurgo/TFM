Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr S Ali
For the respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Azhar Mahmood, date of birth 2.4.74,  is  a  citizen  of
    Pakistan.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Khawar promulgated 17.6.14, dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    decision  of  the  respondent,  dated  30.4.13,  to   refuse   Tier   1
    entrepreneur application.  The Judge heard the appeal on 6.2.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth refused permission to appeal  on
    21.8.14, but when the application was renewed to  the  Upper  Tribunal,
    Upper Tribunal  Judge  Clive  Lane  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    16.12.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 3.2.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Khawar should be set aside.

 6. The Tier 1 application was refused for  failure  of  the  appellant  to
    comply with the specified evidence requirements of paragraph  41-SD  of
    Appendix A.

 7. Judge Khawar found in the appellant's favour in respect of two  issues,
    set out at �14 and �15 of the decision. However, between  �16  and  �18
    the judge found that in respect of the required  letter  from  a  legal
    representative confirming the validity of the signature  of  the  third
    party on the third party declaration, the requirements of paragraph 41-
    SD(b)(ii) had not been met and thus dismissed the appeal.

 8. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Lane found it arguable that  at
    �18  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  may   have   misunderstood   the
    appellant's evidence, as asserted in the  grounds  of  application  for
    permission to appeal.

 9. I am satisfied, for the reasons  set  out  herein,  that  there  is  no
    material error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

10. I do not agree  with  Judge  Khawar's  conclusions  on  the  first  two
    specified evidence issues. The judge purported  to  find  that  as  the
    missing required information could be obtained elsewhere or from  other
    documents, the requirements  were  met.  The  judge  has  no  power  to
    dispense with the strict requirements of 41-SD which specify format and
    content of required documents. The judge  was  wrong  to  excuse  those
    failures. However, as the appeal was ultimately dismissed these  errors
    are not material.

11. The grounds wrongly assert that the judge applied the  wrong  provision
    of 41-SD to the third party declaration. Whilst the Rules now in  force
    have changed the layout and content of 41-SD at the date  of  decision,
    30.4.13, the Rules then in force are as stated by the judge, i.e.  that
    the relevant requirement is 41-SD(b)(ii).

12. Mr Ali seems to have  misunderstood  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to attack the third party declaration document at  G3  of  the
    respondent's bundle. In fact, the deficiency the judge referred to  was
    the legal representative's letter  at  H1.  The  author,  Shafiq  Ahmed
    asserts in that letter, dated 30.11.12, that the declaration  was  made
    under oath and signed before him on 30.11.12. However, the document  as
    copied in the bundle at G3 shows the signature  of  a  different  legal
    representative, Mr Syed Tanweer Akhtar. It was  explained  to  me  that
    this was the legal representative  witnessing  the  signatures  of  the
    entrepreneurial team applicants, including the appellant. But  that  is
    not the issue. The document does not show that the legal representative
    in Pakistan, Mr Ahmed, was present or that he witnesses the  making  of
    the declaration or the signature of the third party investor. When  the
    original document was produced from the Home Office file, it turned out
    to  be  foolscap  and  thus  the  witnessing  signature  of  the  legal
    representative had been missed off  when  photocopied  onto  A4  paper.
    However, rather than the signature of Mr Ahmed, as Mr Ali asserted, the
    original shows a third person, Shahida Kanwal  as  notary  public,  but
    this is dated 1.12.12, after the claimed date of the signature  of  the
    third party.

13. In the circumstances, Judge Khawar was entirely correct  to  find  that
    the appellant had failed to proof that the letter at H1 was of a  legal
    representative who could confirm the validity of the signature  of  the
    third party investor in the declaration. The judge was also correct  to
    conclude that the matter could not have been rescued by the application
    of paragraph 245AA, as the appellant had provided a  document  from  an
    entirely  different  individual  than  those  shown  on  the   document
    purporting to have been present and witnessing the making  and  signing
    of the third party declaration.

14. In the circumstances, it is inevitable that the application was  doomed
    to failure and Judge Khawar was correct to dismiss the appeal. There is
    no material error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

Conclusions:

15. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
