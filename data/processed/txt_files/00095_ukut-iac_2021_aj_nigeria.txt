Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, s. 94B: Access to lawyers

(1) In the light of Kiarie and Byndloss [2017] UKSC 42, the  first  question
to be answered by the First-tier Tribunal in an  appeal  involving  a  claim
that has been certified under section 94B of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
and Asylum Act 2002 is whether  the  appellant's  removal  from  the  United
Kingdom pursuant to the  certificate  has  deprived  the  appellant  of  the
ability to secure legal  representation  and/or  to  give  instructions  and
receive advice from United Kingdom lawyers (AJ (s.94B: Kiarie  and  Byndloss
questions) [2018] UKUT 115 (IAC)).

(2) The task for the First-tier Tribunal in answering that question is  fact
and context-specific. The Tribunal must, in  particular,  determine  whether
the facts demonstrate the  kind  of  inconvenience  or  difficulty  that  is
inherent in the appellant being  outside  the  United  Kingdom;  or  whether
there has  been,  or  will  be,  an  actual  impediment  in  the  taking  of
instructions and receiving of advice.

(3) There may be circumstances where, at some point before  the  hearing  is
due to take place, it will be evident that the appellant's legal adviser  is
simply not in a position to mount an effective case, owing to the  appellant
being  outside  the  United  Kingdom.   In  such  circumstances,  it   would
manifestly be wrong to undertake the hearing.

(4) The first question does not, however, necessarily have  to  be  answered
by the Tribunal before the start of any hearing of  the  appeal.  Where  the
position is not clear cut, it will be a matter for the  Tribunal  to  decide
whether it addresses the first question after the hearing has  taken  place.
Matters may arise during that hearing which show the question  falls  to  be
answered in favour of the appellant.  In other cases, the  answer  may  fall
to be answered  in  the  negative,  once  the  hearing  has  occurred.   For
example, the oral evidence may disclose that an issue upon  which  it  might
have been thought the legal adviser was  without  relevant  instructions  is
not, in fact, relevant to the outcome; or that  what  might  otherwise  have
been thought to have been a "gap" in the adviser's instructions  is  not  of
such a nature.

Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, s. 117C(4) and s. 117C(6)

(5) It is unnecessary to "read down" s. 117C(4) in order to avoid  a  breach
of Article 14 of the ECHR because, inter  alia,  the  case-specific  factors
said to support any discrimination are relevant to the s. 117C(6)  exercise,
which requires a more nuanced approach and a collective examination  of  all
relevant matters.

(6) Adverse credibility findings and the fact that  an  individual  was  not
born in the United Kingdom do not obviate the requirement to apply  the  key
principle in Maslov v Austria [2009] INLR 47, as explained in  CI  (Nigeria)
v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 2027



                    DECISION AND REASONS ON ERROR OF LAW



A.   INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

 1. Upper Tribunal Judge Pitt has substantially contributed to the  writing
    of this decision.  It concerns an appeal  against  a  decision  of  the
    respondent dated 14 April 2020, which refused the appellant's Article 8
    ECHR claim.  The appellant brought that  claim  in  the  context  of  a
    deportation order made against him on 3 March 2015.

 2. The appellant's personal and immigration history has already  been  set
    out in some detail by the First-tier Tribunal  and  Upper  Tribunal  in
    previous decisions but it is expedient to provide some of that  history
    again here.

 3. The appellant was born in Nigeria on 17 December 1987.  He came to  the
    UK with his mother, Lovett Juba, in 1989 when he  was  just  under  two
    years' old.  Having come to the UK on a visitor visa,  the  appellant's
    mother overstayed and the family remained here for an extensive  period
    of time without leave.  In due course, however, on 8 October 2009,  the
    appellant, his mother and his sister, Adetoun, were granted  indefinite
    leave to remain (ILR).

 4. The appellant began  committing  criminal  offences  in  2003  when  he
    received a warning for taking a conveyance without authority.   Further
    offences of possession of cannabis occurred in 2005,  2007,  2008,  and
    2009 for which the appellant received fines of between �66 and �80.  An
    offence of possession of cannabis in 2008  led  to  a  community  order
    which the appellant breached.

 5. On 25  November  2014,  at  Croydon  Crown  Court,  the  appellant  was
    convicted  of  child  abduction  and  sentenced  to  eighteen   months'
    imprisonment.  A Sexual Offences Prevention Order was made for  a  five
    year term.

 6. This offence  led  to  the  respondent  commencing  deportation  action
    against the appellant. In response to deportation action, on 15 January
    2015, the appellant made an  Article  8  ECHR  claim.   The  respondent
    refused that claim on 13 February 2015 and certified it  under  section
    94B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act).
     The section 94B certificate permitted the  respondent  to  remove  the
    appellant to Nigeria pending the  outcome  of  an  appeal  against  his
    Article 8 ECHR claim.

 7. On 3 March 2015 the respondent made a  deportation  order  against  the
    appellant.  On the same day, the Upper Tribunal refused  permission  to
    apply for a judicial review of the s.94B  certificate.   Permission  to
    appeal to the Court of Appeal was refused as was a renewed application.
     On 28 July 2015 the appellant was deported to Nigeria.

 8. On 14 August 2015, the appellant lodged  an  appeal  from  outside  the
    United Kingdom, against the refusal of his  human  rights  claim.   The
    appeal was heard by the First-tier Tribunal  on  19  May  2017.   In  a
    decision issued on 31 May 2017, the First-tier Tribunal  dismissed  the
    appeal.   The  appellant  was  represented  in  those  proceedings   by
    Cleveland Law Limited and the First-tier Tribunal heard  oral  evidence
    from the appellant's mother and father.  No provision was made for  the
    appellant to participate in the hearing.

 9. With the assistance of new  legal  representatives,  Wilson  Solicitors
    LLP,  the  appellant  appealed  against  the  decision  of   First-tier
    Tribunal.  The Upper Tribunal found an error of law in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision and set it aside to be  remade  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  The Upper Tribunal decision was reported as AJ (Section 94B;
    Kiarie and Byndloss questions) Nigeria [2018] UKUT  115  (IAC);  [2018]
    Imm AR 976 and identified that the First-tier Tribunal erred in failing
    to assess whether the appeal could be determined without the  appellant
    being physically present in the UK.

10. The appeal then came before the First-tier Tribunal again on 11 and  12
    February 2020 before a three-person panel, including its President.  As
    before us, the  appellant  was  represented  by  Mr  Westgate  and  the
    respondent  by  Mr  Kovats.   The   appellant   participated   in   the
    proceedings, including giving live evidence, via a video link from  the
    British High Commission in Lagos.  The panel  also  heard  evidence  in
    person from the appellant's  mother,  Lovett  Juba.   In  the  decision
    issued on 14 April 2020, the First-tier Tribunal concluded  that  there
    had been an effective hearing and that the  appellant  could  not  show
    that his Article 8 ECHR rights were breached  by  deportation  and  the
    appeal was dismissed.

11. The appellant appealed again against the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal panel.  He was granted  permission  to  appeal  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal on 17 August 2020.  Thus  the  matter  came  before  us  at  a
    hearing on 1 December 2020.




B.   DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL

12. The  First-tier  Tribunal  considered  first  whether  the  appeal  was
    effective where the appellant remained abroad. The panel concluded, for
    the reasons set out in paragraphs 18 to 28 of the  decision,  that  the
    appellant had been afforded "full opportunity to instruct  and  receive
    advice  from  his  UK  lawyers".   The  First-tier  Tribunal  found  in
    paragraphs 29 to 32 that the appellant's ability to produce expert  and
    other professional evidence was not impaired. In paragraphs  33  to  39
    the panel found  that  the  appellant  had  been  able  to  participate
    effectively in the hearing and that there had been a fair  disposal  of
    the appeal notwithstanding his being in Nigeria.

13. The appellant's oral evidence was recorded by the  First-tier  Tribunal
    in  paragraphs  40  to  60  of  the  decision.   The  evidence  of  the
    appellant's mother was set out in paragraphs 61 to 75 of the  decision.
    The First-tier Tribunal referred to the legal  framework  within  which
    the evidence had to be considered in paragraphs 76 to 79.

14. The First-tier Tribunal then  conducted  an  analysis  of  whether  the
    evidence showed that the exception to deportation set  out  in  section
    117C(4) of the 2002 Act was met. The panel concluded that the appellant
    had not been in the UK  legally  for  more  than  half  his  life  and,
    therefore, that section 117C(4)(a) was not met.  For  the  reasons  set
    out in paragraphs 90 to 92 of the  decision,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    found that the appellant was socially and culturally integrated in  the
    UK and that section 117C(4)(b) was met.

15. The First-tier Tribunal then went on in paragraphs 93 to 113 to  assess
    whether the appellant faced very significant obstacles to reintegration
    in Nigeria.  The panel found that material parts of the evidence of the
    appellant and Lovett Juba were not  credible  and  concluded  that  the
    appellant had access to some support, was  "a young, single man with no
    health problems who can make  his  way  in  Nigeria".   The  First-tier
    Tribunal  therefore  found  that  the  "very   significant   obstacles"
    threshold in s.117C(4)(c) was not met.

16. In paragraphs 114 to  131  of  the  decision  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    assessed whether there were very compelling  circumstances  capable  of
    outweighing the public interest in deportation.   The  panel  concluded
    that there were not and that s.117C(6) of the 2002 Act was not met. The
    appeal therefore had to be dismissed.




C.   GROUNDS OF APPEAL

17. The  appellant  relied  on  grounds  dated  12  May  2020  and  further
    submissions dated  17  July  2020.   Mr  Westgate  confirmed  that  the
    appellant no longer relied on Ground 3 concerning  data  protection  in
    light of the case  of  Johnson  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2020] EWCA Civ 1032.

18. The broad challenges remaining were:-

         Ground 1 - Was the appeal from abroad effective?

         Ground 2 - Were the  credibility  findings  which  underpinned  the
                   conclusion that there were no very significant  obstacles
                   to reintegration lawful?

         Ground 4  -  When  finding  that  there  were  no  very  compelling
                   circumstances, did the First-tier  Tribunal  err  in  the
                   approach to the appellant's long residence in the UK?




D.   DISCUSSION AND REASONS

    Ground 1 - The Panel failed to properly grapple with  the  evidence  of
    Andrew Jones, and departed from his opinion about the adequacy  of  the
    opportunity that he had had to take instructions without good reason.
    The Panel ought to have held that the respondent  had  not  established
    that the appeal from abroad could be  effected  given  the  appellant's
    limited ability to communicate with his legal adviser.

21. In Kiarie v Home Secretary [2017] UKSC 42; [2017]  Imm  AR  1299,  Lord
    Wilson identified as one of his concerns, the effect of section 94B  of
    the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  on  "obstructing
    presentation of the appeal".  At paragraph 60 of the  judgment,  having
    dealt with the issue of legal aid, Lord Wilson said:-

         "60. ... Even if an appellant abroad secured  legal  representation
             from one source or another,  he  and  his  lawyer  would  face
             formidable difficulties in giving and  receiving  instructions
             both prior to  the  hearing  and  in  particular  (as  I  will
             explain) during the hearing.  The issue for this court is  not
             whether article 8 requires a lawyer to be  made  available  to
             represent an appellant who has been removed abroad in  advance
             of his appeal but whether, irrespective of  whether  a  lawyer
             would be available to represent him, article 8  requires  that
             he be not removed abroad in advance of it."

22. The difficulties Lord Wilson mentioned  that  might  arise  during  the
    hearing concerned the feasibility of obtaining  a  satisfactory  video-
    link between an appellant, located abroad, and  the  Tribunal  and  the
    respective legal teams, located in the United Kingdom.  For  his  part,
    Lord Carnwath, at paragraph 96, recognised that "there are likely to be
    major logistical problems in ensuring that documents are made available
    and instructions obtained in the run-up and during the  course  of  the
    hearing".  Nevertheless, at paragraph 103, Lord Carnwath saw "no reason
    in principle why use of modern video facilities should not  provide  an
    effective means of  providing  oral  evidence  and  participation  from
    abroad, so long as the necessary resources are available".

23. In AJ (s.94B: Kiarie and Byndloss questions) Nigeria  [2018]  UKUT  115
    (IAC), the Upper Tribunal  held  that,  in  the  light  of  Kiarie  and
    Byndloss, the First-tier Tribunal should adopt a step-by-step  approach
    in order to determine whether an appeal certified under section 94B can
    be determined without the appellant being  physically  present  in  the
    United Kingdom.

24. The First-tier Tribunal should address the following questions:-

         (1)   Has  the  appellant's  removal  pursuant  to  a  section  94B
             certificate deprived the appellant of the  ability  to  secure
             legal representation and/or to give instructions  and  receive
             advice from United Kingdom lawyers?

         (2)  If not, is the appellant's absence  from  the  United  Kingdom
             likely materially to impair the production of expert and other
             professional evidence in respect of the appellant, upon  which
             the appellant would otherwise have relied?

         (3)  If not, is  it  necessary  to  hear  live  evidence  from  the
             appellant?

         (4)  If so, can such evidence, in all the circumstances,  be  given
             in a satisfactory manner by means of a video-link?

25. As can be seen, ground 1 of the appellant's challenge to  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal concerns the first of these "AJ" questions.

26. The following paragraphs of AJ are also of relevance:-

         "45. Assuming that the appellant is legally represented, the First-
             tier Tribunal will need to be satisfied that the appellant has
             been able to  provide  adequate  instructions  to  his  United
             Kingdom lawyers and to  receive  advice  from  those  lawyers.
             Given  the  state  of  modern  communications,  there  is,  in
             general, no reason why communication by  telephone  and  email
             should not be regarded as  adequate,  particularly  where  the
             appellant's direct instructions can be supplemented by  United
             Kingdom relatives or friends.

         ...

         Points to bear in mind

         49.  It is important to stress that the First-tier Tribunal  should
             not lightly come to the conclusion that none of these  issues,
             whether viewed individually or collectively, prevents the fair
             hearing of the appeal.  The thrust of Lord  Wilson's  judgment
             is plain.  The difficulties facing a  person  in  bringing  an
             appeal in these circumstances are, in many cases, likely to be
             such as to make the proceedings Article 8  non-compliant.   In
             our  view,  however,  bearing  in   mind   the   judgment   of
             Hickinbottom  LJ  in  Nixon  (albeit  acknowledging  it  is  a
             permission decision), the questions  need  to  be  raised  and
             answered.

         50.   If the First-tier Tribunal comes to the conclusion that,  for
             example, adequate instructions have not been able to be  given
             to the appellant's legal adviser,  then  the  availability  or
             otherwise of video-link facilities for hearing  the  appellant
             give  evidence  will  be  immaterial,  unless  the  First-tier
             Tribunal   concludes   that   any    deficiencies    regarding
             instructions  can  be  addressed  by  a  private  consultation
             between the  appellant  and  his  legal  adviser,  using  such
             facilities, before the hearing begins."

27. Mr Westgate QC drew attention to the judgment of the  Divisional  Court
    in R v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  ex  parte  Anderson
    [1984] Q.B. 778.  The claimant in that case  had  been  involved  in  a
    disturbance at a prison.  He sought an order compelling  the  Secretary
    of State to enable the claimant to be interviewed by his legal adviser.
     In finding in favour of the claimant, the  Divisional  Court  observed
    that "a citizen's right of unimpeded access to the courts can  only  be
    taken away by express enactment": see Raymond v Honey [1983] 1 A.C.  1,
    14, per Lord Bridge of Harwich.  The Divisional Court held that section
    47 of the Prison Act 1952 was "insufficient to authorise hinderance  or
    interference with so basic a right as the right of unimpeded access  to
    the courts".

28. Mr Westgate also drew attention to the  judgment  of  Lord  Reed  in  R
    (Osborn) v Parole Board [2013] UKSC 61 where,  at  paragraph  68,  Lord
    Reed held that:-

         "Justice is intuitively understood to  require  a  procedure  which
         pays due respect to persons whose rights are significantly affected
         by decisions taken in the exercise of  administrative  or  judicial
         functions.  Respect entails that such persons ought to be  able  to
         participate in  the  procedure  by  which  the  decision  is  made,
         provided they have something  to  say  which  is  relevant  to  the
         decision to be taken."

29. We now turn to the facts of the  appellant's  case,  as  they  bear  on
    ground 1.  Mr Jones is the appellant's solicitor.  He filed two witness
    statements before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   In  his  first  witness
    statement, he explained the need to take a detailed  witness  statement
    from an appellant, such as this appellant,  covering  the  individual's
    background and  childhood  circumstances;  their  immigration  history;
    their educational history;  their  employment  history;  their  current
    family circumstances, in particular, current relationships and  contact
    with children; the circumstances of their offence  or  offences;  their
    attitude to their offending; the likely consequences they will face  in
    their country of origin if  deported  and  any  difficulties  that  are
    likely to be encountered there.  Each of those factors was said  to  be
    relevant to the present appellant.

30. The First-tier Tribunal was asked by Mr  Jones  to  bear  in  mind  the
    qualitative  nature  of  face-to-face  meetings;  in  particular   that
    specific issues which end up being covered in  a  statement  cannot  be
    predicted in advance, other than the  broad  generalisations  mentioned
    earlier.  It therefore takes a significant amount of time to  build  up
    trust and confidence with an individual before they feel able to  fully
    disclose personal information.

31. Furthermore, Mr Jones said it was often the case that issues became  an
    important part  of  an  appellant's  evidence,  only  when  these  were
    identified in passing, perhaps as an anecdote.  Whilst in theory  there
    was nothing that excluded  such  useful  and  productive  conversations
    happening over the telephone, in Mr Jones's view it was in  the  nature
    of telephone conversations, particularly international ones over mobile
    networks, that made them more difficult.  Furthermore,  preparation  of
    an appellant's statement requires discussion on the contents of various
    papers, such as probation and medical reports.  Mr Jones has experience
    of taking witness statements over the telephone, as opposed to face-to-
    face at the office, in such cases as entry clearance  cases  where  the
    appellant is abroad.  Often, discussions end in confusion,  because  it
    is always more difficult for someone to understand the  contents  of  a
    document that has been described to them than one they can see in front
    of them and read.

32. Mr Jones said it was important that vulnerabilities  an  appellant  may
    have were identified.  While some appellants could self-identify,  this
    was not always the case.  This was obviously something  that  was  much
    more difficult to deal with in a telephone conversation.  The taking of
    telephone instructions from abroad did not entail  just  a  "degree  of
    inconvenience", as has been found by the Upper Tribunal at paragraph 45
    of Watson v Secretary of State for the Home Department (extant  appeal:
    s.94B challenge: forum) [2018] UKUT 165 (IAC); [2018] Imm AR 1094.

33. The present appellant had been, according to Mr Jones, street  homeless
    in Lagos for the vast majority of the time since  he  was  deported  in
    July 2015 and that was currently his situation.  He  lived  in  a  very
    poor part of Lagos, where the electricity supply was intermittent.   He
    charged his phone as and when he could at an internet caf�,  run  by  a
    man with whom he had made friends.  Although the appellant has an email
    account, his only way of checking emails  was  at  the  internet  caf�,
    which he did normally two or three times a week.

34. Mr Jones said that contacting the appellant by phone  was  "difficult".
    On a number of occasions they would agree to speak at a specific  time,
    only for the appellant's phone to be cut off when Mr Jones called.   It
    often took a few days to respond to emails.

35. All this made the planning of the necessary work needed very difficult.
     The appellant had nowhere private and comfortable from which to  speak
    to Mr Jones.  He had to seek out a quiet alleyway or  some  other  such
    place in the open air.

36. In his second witness statement, Mr Jones  set  out  a  log  of  calls,
    comprising conversations with the appellant between 2 November 2018 and
    20 January 2020.  Time on the calls amounted to a total  of  35  hours.
    In addition,  Mr  Jones  said  that  he  had  email  contact  with  the
    appellant.  The statement set out certain difficulties  that  Mr  Jones
    had encountered in respect of some of the  telephone  calls  over  that
    period.  In addition, Mr Jones said that he had generally been hampered
    by noise in the background, due to the  fact  that  the  appellant  was
    outside, together with unclear  phone  connections,  talking  over  one
    another due to possible delay on  the  line,  and  not  being  able  to
    observe one another's body language.  All of this, in Mr Jones's  view,
    helped to create circumstances "that are not conducive to the full  and
    detailed discussion which is required for the proper preparation  of  a
    witness  statement".   Mr   Jones   remained   concerned   that   these
    difficulties  "have  impaired  the  process   of   taking   Mr   Juba's
    instructions and preparing his witness statement".

37. The appellant's witness statement before the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    just over 30 pages long and ran to  86  paragraphs.   It  described  in
    detail the appellant's  life  in  the  United  Kingdom,  including  his
    attendance at schools and colleges, and his  employment  history.   The
    statement  also  set  out  the  personal  and  family  history  of  the
    appellant.  His interests in music and basketball  were  mentioned,  as
    well as films that he had seen with his friends  at  the  cinema.   The
    appellant said that, following his deportation in 2015, he kept  up-to-
    date as much as possible with what was going on in the United  Kingdom,
    listening to a lot of UK radio stations when in the internet caf�.   He
    was aware of the general election  in  December  2019.   The  statement
    described the appellant's  political  views  and  that  he  had  "mixed
    feelings about Brexit", detailing the pros and cons, as  he  saw  them.
    He described following Arsenal, stating  however  that  it  was  "quite
    agonising at the moment as they seem to be losing everything".

38. The statement then turned to  the  appellant's  lack  of  knowledge  of
    Nigeria and  what  he  knew  about  relatives  in  that  country.   The
    statement dealt in detail with his relationship with his father.  After
    a further description of his education and time in the United  Kingdom,
    the statement described the appellant's arrest and his time on  remand.
    The statement referred to the circumstances of the appellant's  offence
    and its background.  Beginning at paragraph 53, the statement  set  out
    in considerable detail the appellant's arrival in Nigeria, as a  result
    of his deportation,  and  what  he  subsequently  experienced  in  that
    country.  He described meeting various people,  including  his  friend,
    Tunde, who is the only person that he could describe  as  a  friend  in
    Lagos.  The appellant also referred to assistance that he had  received
    from churches.

39. The appellant's statement recorded that in 2016, the appellant's mother
    obtained a place for him on a film  editing  course  in  Nigeria.   The
    appellant stayed for about two months at a hostel,  whilst  undertaking
    the  course  but  he  left  "after  having  problems  with  some  other
    students".  After that, the appellant said he  went  back  to  sleeping
    rough.  He then described his contact with the  organisation  known  as
    CYID.

40. In 2018, Tunde got married but the appellant was  still  able  to  stay
    with Tunde occasionally.  Tunde was, however, not able  or  willing  to
    help the appellant as he had been before.  The  appellant  slept  at  a
    stadium which he described as "horrible".   He  spent  a  lot  of  time
    hanging around at the  stadium,  where  there  were  sports  facilities
    available for free.  The appellant said that in recent  months  he  had
    reduced the days that he went to the internet caf� because  Tunde  used
    to work there but did not do so any longer.  The appellant  had  looked
    for work but had found it very difficult and had not been able to get a
    single job, apart from helping a woman sell fruit from a  stall  for  a
    couple days at some point in 2017.  His main  problem  was  not  having
    proof of an address and someone to act as his guarantor.   Since  being
    deported, the appellant said he had been in contact  at  various  times
    with the mother of his child in the United Kingdom  but  she  was  very
    volatile and there were periods when she would not let him speak to his
    daughter.  The  appellant  did,  however,  speak  to  his  daughter  on
    occasions when she was staying at the appellant's mother's  home.   The
    appellant and his daughter had also had one Skype conversation.

41. The First-tier Tribunal addressed the evidence of Mr Jones as follows:-


         "18. Andrew Jones solicitor for the appellant, made two  statements
             dated 16 October 2018 and 20 January 2020.  They  are  in  the
             appellant's  bundle  at  tab  A,   pages   72-83   and   84-89
             respectively.

         19.  Mr Jones has only represented  the  appellant  since  14  June
             2017, following the First-tier  Tribunal's  dismissal  of  his
             appeal on 31 May 2017.

         20.  Mr Jones adopted his two statements and confirmed the truth of
             the same.

         21.  Mr Jones confirmed that he and Counsel had a Skype  conference
             with the appellant on 3 February when the  appellant  attended
             at the Deputy High Commission in Lagos.  The conference lasted
             three and a half hours.  Asked by Mr Kovats how  it  went,  Mr
             Jones said that they could take instructions.  Mr  Jones  also
             confirmed  that  they  had   been   able   to   satisfactorily
             communicate with the appellant prior to the hearing.

         22.  Mr Jones confirmed what he had said at  [28]  that  between  5
             March 2019 and 20 January 2020, he spoke to the appellant  for
             35 hours on the telephone.

         23.  Mr Jones explained that his  view  was  that  the  process  of
             taking the appellant's instructions and preparing his  witness
             statement had been impaired because of the difficulties he set
             out in his statements.  He acknowledged that he had spent more
             time in the preparation of the appellant's case; 35  hours  as
             opposed to an average on other cases of 21 hours.

         24.  Mr Jones said  that  spending  an  extra  amount  of  time  in
             preparation did  not  compensate  for  what  he  described  as
             suboptimal instructions or instructions  taken  in  suboptimal
             conditions.  He said he could not be sure  that  he  had  been
             able to get all the  relevant  points.   Asked  by  Mr  Kovats
             whether at the date of the hearing  Mr  Jones  believed  there
             were other matters of materiality  affecting  the  appellant's
             appeal, he said that he could not be sure.  As he put  it,  he
             could not know what he did not know.

         25.  Mr Jones identified particular difficulties:

                . it was more difficult to take the  appellant  through  the
                  various documentation in preparing  his  statement  as  he
                  needed to be able to  see  the  relevant  documents.   See
                  [13], page 77;




                . establishing a clear chronology  of  events  can  be  very
                  difficult  over  a  telephone  because  it  helps  for  an
                  appellant to see visually how events fit together and  the
                  only way to do that is to set out a chronology on paper;




                .  Mr  Jones  explained  that  in  assessing  any   possible
                  vulnerability, absent an  appellant  self-identifying  the
                  same, it would be necessary  for  Mr  Jones  to  be  in  a
                  position to note any potential indicators of vulnerability
                  which is more difficult in telephone conversations than in
                  a face to face meeting.  Mr Jones said that being  limited
                  to  phone  contact  with  an   appellant   increased   the
                  likelihood of such issues being overlooked.  Mr Jones said
                  that he could  never  be  as  confident  regarding  taking
                  instructions and spotting vulnerabilities in  a  situation
                  such as he was in with the appellant,  as  he  would  have
                  been if he had been able to  see  the  appellant  face  to
                  face.  As  regards  taking  instructions  from  family  or
                  friends, Mr Jones said it was not more  difficult  because
                  the appellant was out of country.

         26.  Mr Westgate submitted that the question for us is whether  the
             appellant had an adequate opportunity  to  give  instructions.
             In Mr Westgate's view the appellant was at a disadvantage from
             the outset for the reasons claimed by Mr Jones such  that  the
             disadvantage could not be cured by the Tribunal  weighing  the
             situation at the end of the hearing.

         27.  Our view at the hearing having heard the evidence of Mr  Jones
             and  the  submissions  made  by  Mr  Westgate  was  that   the
             appellant's removal had not deprived him  of  the  ability  to
             secure legal representation and/or to  give  instructions  and
             receive advice from those advising him.

         28.  We acknowledge that the ideal must be for all evidence  to  be
             given in person in court.  Nevertheless, Mr Jones has produced
             a lengthy, detailed and comprehensive bundle.  He has prepared
             two detailed witness statements dated  4  September  2017  and
             20 January 2020.  We do accept that Mr Jones has  been  faced
             with  difficulties  in  communicating  with   the   appellant.
             Communication  has  not  been  straightforward  but  there  is
             nothing to suggest that the appellant has had  anything  other
             than excellent representation and full opportunity to instruct
             and receive advice from his UK lawyers.   We  find  Mr  Jones'
             concerns that more might have come out, had he  been  able  to
             take instructions from the  appellant  face  to  face,  to  be
             speculative and without foundation."

42. Mr Westgate submits that, at paragraph 28 of its decision,  the  First-
    tier Tribunal focussed on the wrong questions; namely, the  quality  of
    the representation that the appellant had received, rather than whether
    the process was fair and whether the appellant  had  had  an  effective
    ability to communicate with his lawyers.

43. In our view, paragraph 28 of the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  needs
    to be read in the context of the decision as a whole.   The  Tribunal's
    phrase "excellent representation and full opportunity to  instruct  and
    receive advice from his UK lawyers" demonstrates  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was, in substance,  considering  the  first  of  the  four  AJ
    questions.  Plainly, the quality of the representation is of  relevance
    in deciding whether an appellant has been deprived of  the  ability  to
    secure legal representation of the nature needed in order to  mount  an
    effective appeal from outside the United Kingdom.

44. The Tribunal's reference to "full opportunity to instruct  and  receive
    advice" is not, as Mr Westgate submits,  perverse.   The  Tribunal  was
    concerned with whether the opportunity to instruct and  receive  advice
    had been materially impaired.  It is clear  from  the  paragraphs  that
    precede paragraph 28 that the First-tier Tribunal was well aware of the
    difficulties that Mr Jones  had  encountered,  and  which  led  to  him
    spending significantly more time on the  appellant's  case  than  would
    have been likely, had the appellant been present in the United Kingdom.
     In describing the appellant's opportunity  as  "full"  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was not, in our view, ignoring the difficulties  described  by
    Mr Jones.  Rather, it was concluding that, despite them, the  first  of
    the AJ questions fell to be answered positively.

45. In so finding, we agree with Mr Westgate that section 94B of  the  2002
    Act does not expressly or impliedly mandate  any  diminution  from  the
    common law requirement  for  a  person  to  have  unimpeded  access  to
    justice, which includes access to a legal  adviser.   If  the  position
    were otherwise, the Supreme Court in Kiarie would have so  found.   The
    task for the First-tier Tribunal, in answering the first  AJ  question,
    is fact  and  context-specific.   The  Tribunal  must,  in  particular,
    determine whether the facts demonstrate the kind  of  inconvenience  or
    difficulty that is inherent in the appellant being outside  the  United
    Kingdom; or whether there has been, or will be, an actual impediment in
    the taking of instructions and receiving of advice.

46. Mr Westgate criticises the Tribunal for not having  appropriate  regard
    to the evidence of Mr Jones.  Given  the  way  in  which  the  Tribunal
    approached his evidence it is, however, not possible to sustain such  a
    criticism.  Whilst Mr Jones has very  great  experience  of  presenting
    human rights claims, the experienced First-tier Tribunal panel, for its
    part, has commensurate experience in hearing and deciding such  claims.



47. The panel can be assumed to have had  regard,  in  particular,  to  the
    appellant's witness statement, which we have  summarised  above.   That
    statement is, on any view, extremely detailed, covering all aspects  of
    the appellant's life in the United Kingdom and Nigeria, down to  levels
    of detail such as the appellant's views on  Brexit  and  his  favourite
    football team.

48. Mr Westgate  criticises  the  Tribunal  for  finding  that  Mr  Jones's
    concerns, that more might have come out,  had  he  been  able  to  take
    instructions from the  appellant  face-to-face,  were  speculative  and
    without foundation.  Mr Jones had said  in  cross-examination  that  he
    could not know what he did not know.  The issue  has,  however,  to  be
    addressed in a fact-specific manner, applying the Tribunal's expertise.
     Given the number of  hours  quite  properly  spent  by  Mr  Jones,  in
    communication  with  the  appellant,  and   despite   the   sub-optimal
    circumstances of those communications, of which the Tribunal was  fully
    aware, the Tribunal was, in our view,  entitled  to  conclude  that  Mr
    Jones's residual concerns that something might have been  missing  were
    not such as to constitute an impediment to justice, as described above.



49. Mr  Westgate  raises  a  challenge  to  the  temporal  element  of  the
    Tribunal's conclusion on AJ question 1.  He submits that this  question
    falls to answered  before  the  Tribunal  embarks  on  the  substantive
    hearing.  The Tribunal must, in all cases, answer the question at  that
    point.  If the answer is in the appellant's favour,  then  the  hearing
    should not take place.  If the answer to the question  is  not  in  the
    appellant's favour at that point, then the Tribunal should embark  upon
    the hearing on the basis that it may emerge during the  course  of  the
    hearing that the appellant has not, in fact, had the requisite  ability
    to give instructions or receive advice.  If so, the Tribunal would have
    to adjourn, having given a direction that the appeal cannot be lawfully
    determined unless the appellant is physically  present  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

50. Although such a course may be necessary in  certain  circumstances,  we
    consider it would be wrong to make it mandatory in  all  cases.   There
    may, of course, be  circumstances  where,  at  some  point  before  the
    hearing is due to take place, it will be evident that  the  appellant's
    legal adviser is simply not in a position to mount an  effective  case,
    owing to the appellant being  outside  the  United  Kingdom.   In  such
    circumstances, it would manifestly be wrong to undertake  the  hearing.
    Where, however, the position is not clear cut, it will be a matter  for
    the Tribunal to decide whether it addresses the  first  question  after
    the hearing has taken place.  Mr  Westgate  is  quite  correct  to  say
    matters may arise during that hearing which show the question falls  to
    be answered in favour of the appellant.  We do not agree, however, that
    it can never be the case that the answer may fall to be answered in the
    negative, once  the  hearing  has  occurred.   For  example,  the  oral
    evidence may disclose that an issue  upon  which  it  might  have  been
    thought the adviser was without relevant instructions is not, in  fact,
    relevant to the outcome; or that what might otherwise have been thought
    to have been a "gap" in the adviser's instructions is  not  of  such  a
    nature.

51. The Tribunal must, however,  guard  against  the  danger  that,  merely
    because it appears all has proceeded  smoothly  at  the  hearing,  this
    necessarily means there has been no actual impediment in the giving  of
    instructions and receiving of advice.

52. Having considered the decision of the First-tier Tribunal,  and  having
    had full regard to submissions of Mr Westgate,  we  conclude  that  the
    Tribunal committed no error of the kind alleged in ground 1.


    Ground  2  -  Were  the  credibility  findings  which  underpinned  the
    conclusion  that  there  were  no   very   significant   obstacles   to
    reintegration lawful?



53. The First-tier Tribunal found that the  appellant  did  not  face  very
    significant  obstacles  to  reintegration  in  Nigeria  and   therefore
    concluded that section 117C(4)(c) of the 2002 Act  was  not  met.   The
    grounds submitted that:


         "In reaching these conclusions the Panel made factual findings that
         were not open to it on the evidence and it failed to have regard to
         relevant considerations or to  address  material  evidence.   These
         errors affect the overall assessment of the Appellant's credibility
         and are addressed below."

54. The grounds went to on challenge five specific aspects of the  findings
    made by the First-tier Tribunal, the first four taken from the headings
    used in the decision:-

          a. support from Charles Juba (the appellant's father)

          b. involvement with the Centre for Youths Integrated  Development
             (CYID)

          c. family support

          d. homelessness

          e. demeanour

55. Before  turning  to  the  specific  findings  under  challenge,  it  is
    important to set  out  the  context  in  which  they  were  made.   The
    credibility findings said to be unlawful are  immediately  preceded  in
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal by unchallenged  findings  that
    the appellant and his mother had  shown  themselves  to  be  untruthful
    witnesses. In paragraphs 98 to 100 of the decision, under  the  heading
    "A Previous Willingness  to  Lie"  the  First-tier  Tribunal  found  as
    follows:-

         "Previous Willingness to Lie

         98. The appellant had a previous deportation hearing heard  on  19
             May 2017.  In support of that appeal, Mrs Lovett Juba  made  a
             statement dated 16 May  2017.    She  endorsed  the  statement
             saying that it was true to  the  best  of  her  knowledge  and
             belief.  There was a fundamental untruth at [6] when Mrs  Juba
             said:

                  '6.  As father and guardian their  father  was  always  in
                      contact with my children and  enjoyed  spending  time
                      with them.  My son,  the  appellant,  was  always  in
                      contact with his  father  until  he  was  removed  to
                      Nigeria in July 2015.'

         99. In cross-examination, Mrs Juba said that in 2017 at the  first
             deportation hearing, she told the judge that she  was  telling
             the truth but she conceded that she was  not  doing  so.   Mrs
             Juba's explanation for the  lie  was  that  her  solicitor  at
             Cleveland Law Limited put her up to it.  He told  her  it  was
             best to say what she  did.   Because  he  was  a  lawyer,  she
             thought she should do  what  he  said.   We  are  particularly
             concerned that  a  grave  allegation  has  been  made  against
             Cleveland Law Limited without them  being  asked  to  comment.
             See BT (Former solicitors  alleged  misconduct)  Nepal  [2004]
             UKIAT 00311 and MM [2004] UKIAT  00182  at  [36].  We  do  not
             accept that Cleveland Law Limited advised Mrs Juba to  lie  to
             the Tribunal.  The appellant also had criticisms  to  make  of
             Cleveland Law Limited in his statement of  4  September  2017.
             There was no evidence  that  any  of  the  complaints  against
             Cleveland Law  Limited  in  particular  at  [15]-[16]  of  his
             statement were ever put to them.

        100. The appellant has also lied.  In his statement of 4  September
             2017, made  when  the  current  solicitors  Wilsons  had  been
             instructed, presumably for the  Upper  Tribunal  hearing,  the
             appellant signed a statement stating that the facts were  true
             when he knew that was not the case.  He said at [7]  that  his
             mum brought his daughter to see him in prison which was untrue
             and which he acknowledged  at  [52]  of  his  statement  dated
             20 January 2020".

56. Further, the panel was told that the appellant's father, Charles  Juba,
    had also given false evidence at the  hearing  in  2017  by  way  of  a
    witness statement dated 19 May 2017. Lovett Juba commented on  this  in
    paragraph 36 of her statement dated 14 January 2020:-
             "It was  only  after  he  had  been  deported  that  Abi  [the
             appellant] himself made contact with his father via  Facebook.
             At that time we did  not  have  a  working  phone  number  for
             Charles.  I then got Charles involved in  the  appeal  process
             and made sure he attended the  hearing.  I  explained  to  the
             solicitors  then  dealing  with  the  appeal  what  the   real
             situation was with Charles' lack of involvement in our  lives,
             but the solicitor said that it would be better to say that Abi
             was close with Charles. That is why Charles and I said what we
             said in our statements. I am very sorry that I  did  not  tell
             the truth about this in 2017."

57. The case before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was,  therefore,  that  the
    appellant, his mother and his father had all  lied  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in 2017 and, also, that the  explanation  for  this  given  by
    Lovett Juba was firmly rejected.

58. This was clearly a significant matter.  It will be obvious that it  was
    open to the First-tier Tribunal to approach other evidence  from  those
    witnesses with great caution.

      a. Support from Charles Juba

59. The appellant raised a number of concerns about  the  findings  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal on whether he could access  any  support  from  his
    father, Charles Juba.

60. Firstly, the appellant maintained before the First-tier  Tribunal  that
    at the time of the hearing in 2017 he  had  not  been  aware  that  his
    parents had made false statements about the contact he had with Charles
    Juba.  The First-tier Tribunal rejected this evidence in paragraph  104
    of the decision, finding that it was not "credible that  the  appellant
    would have been unaware of the case put forward on his behalf" in 2017.



61. The appellant submits that this adverse  credibility  finding  was  not
    open to the panel.  It was common ground that  the  2017  statement  by
    Charles Juba was made and signed only on 19 May 2017, the  day  of  the
    hearing, and that the appellant did not participate in that hearing  at
    all.  It was submitted that he could not, therefore, have known at  the
    time what was in his father's statement.

62. We do not find this  argument  had  merit.   Firstly,  as  above,  this
    conclusion was open to the Tribunal given the context of the  appellant
    and his parents all having given false evidence  in  2017.    Secondly,
    the materials show unarguably that the appellant and his mother were in
    close contact after he went to Nigeria in 2015 and that she was closely
    involved in the preparation of the appeal in 2017.  This  is  shown  in
    the extract from her witness statement set out above, for example.  She
    knew before the hearing about the false evidence that was to be  given,
    her own statement dated 16 May 2017 containing  the  false  account  of
    close contact.  It is our view, therefore, that  there  was  more  than
    sufficient evidence for  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  find  that  the
    appellant did know about what was being  said  on  his  behalf  in  the
    appeal in 2017  and  that  they  were  entitled  to  make  the  adverse
    credibility finding in paragraph 104 of the decision.

63. The appellant also submits that the assessment  of  whether  there  was
    support available from Charles Juba failed to take into account  Lovett
    Juba's evidence, for example in her witness statement dated 14  January
    2020, on the reasons why she had  not  wanted  the  appellant  to  have
    contact with his father or the Juba family in Nigeria.

64. We also do not find that this submission is made out for  a  number  of
    reasons.  Firstly, as before, the  panel  was  entitled  to  doubt  the
    reliability of evidence given by Lovett Juba where she had given  false
    evidence previously, indeed, on the specific issue of  the  appellant's
    contact with Charles Juba.  Put simply,  the  panel  did  not  have  to
    accept her evidence at its highest.

65. Secondly, the First-tier Tribunal was clearly aware of this  aspect  of
    the evidence as it is referred to  in  paragraphs  65  and  68  of  the
    decision, Lovett Juba stating:-

         "... she did not ask Charles Juba to help the appellant because she
          has never asked him for such help.  That was because she  did  not
          trust the Jubas."

    The panel was not required to set out every part of the evidence on all
    issues argued before it and it is not arguable that a failure to  refer
    to the more detailed account in the witness  statement  amounts  to  an
    error of law.

66. Thirdly, there was clearly contrary evidence showing that  Lovett  Juba
    had  asked  Charles  Juba  for  support.   She  involved  him  in   the
    appellant's appeal in 2017, for example.  Also, the  evidence  included
    an email exchange dated 17  September  2017  between  Lovett  Juba  and
    Charles Juba in which she upbraids him for  not  having  contacted  the
    appellant when he was visiting Lagos.  This is wholly at odds with  her
    evidence set out in paragraph 68 of the decision  as  to  never  asking
    Charles Juba for help and not trusting the Juba family.

67. We therefore do not find that the grounds show that First-tier Tribunal
    erred in the assessment of the evidence  concerning  potential  support
    from Charles Juba.

68. For completeness sake, in response to an elaboration on this ground set
    out in paragraph 25 of the appellant's skeleton argument,  it  is  also
    not our judgment that the Tribunal was obliged to conclude  from  brief
    emails dated 18 and 19 October  2017  between  the  appellant  and  his
    father that no support was available from Charles Juba  or  members  of
    his family in Nigeria.  Where  they  seek  to  suggest  otherwise,  the
    grounds have no merit.  The suggestion in the  skeleton  argument  that
    the Tribunal should have inferred  from  the  fact  of  Charles  Juba's
    company in Nigeria having closed in 2016 that he and his  relatives  in
    Nigeria could not provide the appellant with  any  support  is  equally
    without force.

69. We therefore conclude  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  took  a  lawful
    approach when assessing the evidence concerning  support  from  Charles
    Juba and his family.

    b.   Centre for Youths Integrated Development (CYID)

70. The appellant also maintained that the First-tier Tribunal erred in the
    assessment of the evidence on  the  appellant's  involvement  with  the
    Centre  for  Youths  Integrated  Development  (CYID).   The   appellant
    maintained that he received limited support from CYID when he  returned
    to Nigeria in 2015 and was no longer in contact with them.   He  relied
    on a letter from the organisation dated 10 May 2017, most of  which  is
    set out in paragraph 45 of the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision.   The
    letter stated that CYID encountered the appellant in 2017, that he  was
    homeless, was not eating regularly, had been robbed and  "was  lost  in
    Nigeria as the country is completely foreign to him."




71. The First-tier Tribunal considered  the  evidence  on  the  appellant's
    involvement with CYID  in paragraph 108:-


         "We have referred to CYID at [45] above.  The appellant  claims  to
         have lost touch with CYID and its director Mr Victor.   We  do  not
         accept as credible that the appellant would not be  keen  to  forge
         links with such an organisation and particularly because  of  their
         aims to  be  a  social  investment  programme  implemented  through
         establishment of a  training  and  referral  service  for  returnee
         migrants as regards opportunities for job creation and employment."

72. The appellant maintains that this finding was not open  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal. Firstly, the First-tier Tribunal failed to  have  regard
    to a further email dated 16 January 2020 from CYID.  This email stated:-



         "... Abiodun was not offered any concrete  services  because  there
         was no funding for such, CYID programs is for  the  duration  of  3
         months and to benefits (sic) from such program  the  returnee  will
         either be living in the environment where the project is located or
         paid for hostel and in this  case  Abiodun  could  not  afford  any
         payment so we were unable to help him further.

         CYID has no communication with him since 2017."

73. Secondly, the appellant maintained that the Tribunal took an irrational
    approach to the evidence from CYID.  In paragraph 45 of  the  decision,
    the panel "relied" on the CYID letter from 2017 as  showing  "that  the
    director of CYID knew a lot about the  appellant  which  the  appellant
    conceded was true."  In paragraph 108 of  the  decision,  however,  the
    panel chose not to rely on the information from  CYID  on  the  limited
    support they gave the appellant.  It was not  open  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to place weight on the parts of the evidence  from  CYID  that
    undermined the appellant and no weight on the parts that supported  his
    case.

74. We do not find that this ground shows a material error for a number  of
    reasons.   Firstly, the statements in paragraph 45 of the decision  are
    not findings of the First-tier Tribunal but  a  record  of  the  cross-
    examination of the appellant by Mr Kovats  on  the  letter  from  CYID.
    They cannot show a contradiction in the approach taken  by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal to the evidence from CYID.  We accept that  the  decision
    makes no reference to the 2020 email from  CYID  and  that  this  email
    provided some additional weight to the appellant's claim  that  he  had
    limited assistance from  CYID.   Having  considered  whether  this  was
    something capable of undermining the overall  credibility  findings  of
    the First-tier Tribunal, we conclude that it was not, given the  extent
    and cogency of the reasoning  given  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
    finding the appellant's evidence that he was  homeless,  destitute  and
    unable to integrate into Nigeria was not credible.

    c.   Family support

75. The undisputed evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal  was  that  the
    appellant had been in receipt of approximately �340 per month from  his
    mother from  2018  onwards.   The  appellant's  evidence,  recorded  in
    paragraphs 46 and 47 of the decision,  was  that  these  funds  made  a
    significant difference as "he was  struggling  until  his  mother  sent
    decent money".  Paragraph 58 of the decision records his statement that
    he "had cleaned up since his mum had been able to send him more money".
     In her statement dated 14 January 2020, at paragraph 57,  Lovett  Juba
    states that sending �340 per month left her with "just enough  to  live
    on".  The figures provided by her in paragraphs 56 and 57 of  her  2020
    witness statement did not suggest that she was unable  to  continue  to
    afford to send the appellant funds.  Those  paragraphs  also  indicated
    that her daughter, Adetoun Juba, offered her support  when  she  needed
    money  for  bills,  that  evidence  being  confirmed  at  the  hearing:
    paragraph 63.

76. Paragraph 30 of the appellant's grounds submitted that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  should  have  considered  whether  the   funding   from   the
    appellant's mother was sustainable. The grounds  also  maintained  that
    the panel erred in finding financial support for the appellant could be
    provided by Adetoun Juba.

77. We find it difficult to see how  the  First-tier  Tribunal  could  have
    concluded other than that the financial support for the  appellant  was
    sustainable.  The  evidence  indicated  that  the  increased  financial
    support had been provided for approximately  two  years.  We  were  not
    taken to evidence showing  that  the  situation  was  not  sustainable,
    albeit that it left Lovett Juba with limited funds.  The finding of the
    First-tier  Tribunal  at  paragraph  112  of  the  decision  that   the
    appellant's sister could help support the appellant, either directly or
    indirectly, was consistent with the evidence  that  she  helped  Lovett
    Juba when needed.  We do not therefore find that these challenges  have
    merit.

    d.   Homelessness

78.  The  appellant  submitted  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred   in
    concluding in paragraph 110 that he was not homeless.  We do  not  find
    this ground has merit.  As above, the evidence before the panel in 2020
    was that appellant was in receipt of �340 per month and he accepted  in
    his evidence that this was a "decent" amount of money that had improved
    his circumstances.  The evidence from CYID was from 2017,  and  so  was
    not current.

79. The appellant also maintained that the conclusion he was  not  homeless
    failed to take into account evidence from his legal representative,  Mr
    Jones, on his first-hand experience of  the  appellant's  circumstances
    whilst taking instructions and giving advice by telephone.   Mr  Jones'
    witness statements dated 16 October 2018 and 20 January 2020  refer  to
    the appellant  having  nowhere  private  to  speak,  difficulties  with
    background noise and difficulties in charging his mobile phone, in part
    due to power cuts.  That  corroborated  the  appellant's  claim  to  be
    homeless.

80. We take no issue with the statements made by Mr Jones and  accept  that
    they are an accurate record of his experience when  communicating  with
    the appellant.  We do not see anything in  those  statements,  however,
    that was inconsistent with the appellant living in a church or a hostel
    as he accepts he has done at times.  We therefore do not find that  the
    evidence from Mr Jones could be determinative of  the  appellant  being
    homeless or showed that the First-tier Tribunal erred in  finding  that
    he was not.

    e.   Demeanour

81. In paragraph 107 the First-tier Tribunal said this:-

         "We do not accept as credible that the appellant has not seen Tunde
         for a few months.  As Mr Kovats put it to the appellant, he  looked
         in good health, clean and that he  had  got  it  together  and  the
         appellant quipped in return that the video link was not  doing  him
         justice. He appeared via the video  link  well  nourished,  smartly
         turned out and presented well, wholly at odds with someone  alleged
         to be living on the margins of Nigerian society."

82. The appellant submits that this  amounted  to  placing  weight  on  the
    appellant's appearance and demeanour and that this  was  unsound.   Our
    view is that these comments drew an inference from physical  appearance
    and not demeanour.  As above, the appellant stated  in  oral  evidence,
    recorded in paragraph 58 of the decision, that "he had cleaned up since
    his mum had been able to send him more money".  He did not suggest that
    he had managed to present well only for the hearing, for  example,  but
    explained that his appearance was due to the increased funding from his
    mother.  We conclude that the First-tier Tribunal was entitled to  find
    that the appellant had "presented well" and was in better circumstances
    than before.

    Ground  4  -  When  finding  that  there  were   no   very   compelling
    circumstances, did the First-tier Tribunal err in the approach  to  the
    appellant's long residence in the UK?

83. Ground 3 was not pursued before us.  In  its  amended  form,  Ground  4
    contains  a  number  of  challenges  to   the   First-tier   Tribunal's
    conclusions on section 117C of the 2002 Act.   The  appellant  contends
    that the First-tier Tribunal erred in finding that  section  117C(4)(a)
    was not satisfied in the case of the appellant.

84. Section 117C(4) states:-

         "(4) Exception 1 applies where -

             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the  United  Kingdom  for
                  most of C's life,

             (b)  C is socially and culturally  integrated  in  the  United
                  Kingdom, and

             (c)   there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   C's
                  integration into the country to which C is proposed to  be
                  deported."

85. If Exception 1 is satisfied then, in the case of a foreign criminal who
    has not been sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of  four  years  or
    more, the public interest does not require his or her deportation.   So
    much is plain from section 117C(3).

86. Even if the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  correct  in  holding  that  the
    appellant had not been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most
    of his life, Mr Westgate submits that the Tribunal erred in  coming  to
    the conclusion, for the purposes of section 117C(6),  that  there  were
    not "very compelling circumstances" in the appellant's case, such as to
    make deportation a disproportionate interference  with  his  Article  8
    rights.

87. In CI (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2019]
    EWCA Civ 2027; [2020] Imm AR 503, the Court  of  Appeal  was  concerned
    with a Nigerian national who had come to the United  Kingdom  with  his
    mother when he was 1 year old and had lived in the country ever  since.
    He was then aged 27.   In  light  of  criminal  offending  by  CI,  the
    decision was made that he should be deported to Nigeria.

88. At paragraphs 100 and 101 of his judgment, Leggatt  LJ  said  the  fact
    that CI had been eligible to apply for indefinite leave  to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom for  almost  ten  years  was  of  relevance  to  the
    proportionality assessment in his case.  By the same token, Mr Westgate
    submits that the First-tier Tribunal was wrong in  failing  to  ascribe
    weight to the fact that the appellant's period of  overstaying  in  the
    United Kingdom, from April 1991 to November 2006, when he  was  granted
    indefinite leave to remain, was of no material significance.  According
    to Mr Westgate, the appellant would  qualify  for  leave  under  Policy
    DP5/96 at any time after 1999, when that policy was amended.

89. In Akinyemi v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2017]  EWCA
    Civ 236; [2017] Imm AR 1216, the appellant (A) was born in  the  United
    Kingdom to Nigerian nationals who, although lawfully present, were  not
    settled (so that A did not become a British citizen by  birth).   There
    was a period during which A would have had an absolute right to  become
    a British citizen, if he had applied for it.  Giving  the  judgment  at
    the Court,  Underhill  LJ  held  that,  for  the  purposes  of  section
    117B(4)(a), which provides that little weight  should  be  given  to  a
    private life established at a time when the person concerned is in  the
    United Kingdom unlawfully, it was "unnatural  to  describe  a  person's
    presence in the UK as "unlawful" (which is not necessarily the same  as
    not being "lawful") when there is no specific legal obligation of which
    they are in breach by being here and no legal right to remove them ..."
    (paragraph 41).  That position arose because A was born in  the  United
    Kingdom.

90. By contrast, CI had not been born in the United Kingdom, a  fact  which
    Leggatt  LJ  regarded  as  highly  significant   in   determining   the
    application of section 117C(4)(a).  This is apparent from paragraph  41
    of the judgment:-

         "41. Furthermore, the fact that sections 117B(4) and 117C(4)(a)  of
             the 2002 Act have a  common  rationale  means  that  to  treat
             someone who is in breach of a legal obligation by being in the
             UK and is legally liable to be removed as "lawfully  resident"
             for the purpose of section 117C(4)(a)  would  be  inconsistent
             with the Akinyemi case, which treated such a person as in  the
             UK "unlawfully" for the purpose of section 117B(4).  Although,
             as Underhill LJ pointed out, the opposite is  not  necessarily
             true, it would be illogical to regard someone who is in the UK
             "unlawfully" as nevertheless "lawfully resident" here, for the
             purpose  of  the  same  exercise  of  deciding   whether   the
             interference with private life caused by deporting the  person
             on account of criminal offending is justified  in  the  public
             interest."

91. At paragraph 50, Leggatt LJ had this to  say  about  sections  117A  to
    117D:-

         50.  ...  It is apparent that Part 5A of the 2002 Act  is  intended
             to provide a  clear  and  straightforward  set  of  rules  for
             decision-makers to apply: see  KO  (Nigeria)  v  Secretary  of
             State for the Home Department [2018] UKSC  53;  [2018]  1  WLR
             5273, paras 14-15.  It would defeat that purpose if, in  order
             to determine whether a person satisfied  the  test  of  lawful
             residence  at  a  particular  time,  it   was   necessary   to
             investigate potentially complex and conjectural  questions  as
             to whether, if an application for leave  to  remain  had  been
             made or determined sooner and had  been  refused,  or  perhaps
             even if such an application was in fact refused, the  decision
             could have been successfully challenged  by  way  of  judicial
             review."

92. At paragraph 51, Leggatt LJ concluded that -

         "the interpretation which is most consistent with the aims  of  the
         legislation, including the aim of legal certainty, looks simply  at
         the person's legal status at the  relevant  time  (subject  to  the
         special  case  of  successful  asylum-seekers).   If   a   "foreign
         criminal" has no legal right to be in the UK and is in breach of UK
         immigration law by being here, then that person  is  not  "lawfully
         resident" in the UK. ..."

93. What, then, is  the  significance  (if  any)  of  a  person  having  an
    immigration history, in which there is a significant period  when  they
    could have applied for, and been entitled to obtain British citizenship
    or indefinite leave  to  remain?   Having  cited  from  R (Agyarko)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 11;  [2017]  Imm
    AR 764, Leggatt LJ held:-

         "53. The stage at which such considerations are relevant,  however,
             in a case involving deportation of a "foreign criminal" is  in
             assessing whether there are  "very  compelling  circumstances"
             over  and  above  those  described  in  the  Exceptions  which
             outweigh the public interest in deportation.  That  is  indeed
             implicit in Lord Reed's  discussion,  which  starts  from  the
             premise that the applicant is residing in the UK unlawfully."

94. As he did before the First-tier Tribunal, Mr Westgate submits that  the
    judgment in CI (Nigeria) does not preclude the appellant from  arguing
    that section 117C(4)(a) requires to be "read down" in order to avoid  a
    breach of Article 14 of the ECHR, taken with Article  8.   Mr  Westgate
    says that the distinction between persons  such  as  the  appellant  in
    Agyarko, who are born in the United Kingdom and those, such as  CI  and
    the present appellant, who are not,  unlawfully  discriminates  against
    the latter.

95. For this purpose, Mr Westgate relies on R (Tigere) v Secretary of State
    for Business, Innovation and Skills [2015] UKSC 57.  In that case,  the
    claimant was an  overstayer  in  the  United  Kingdom,  having  arrived
    lawfully at the age of 6.   She  had  been  educated  in  England.   In
    January 2012 she  was  granted  discretionary  leave  to  remain.   She
    obtained a place at university in England but could not qualify  tor  a
    student loan because of her immigration status.  The Supreme Court held
    that, given the claimant (i) had lived in the United Kingdom  for  most
    of her life; (ii) had been educated here; (iii) could  not  be  removed
    save for grave misconduct; and (iv) had been treated  as  a  member  of
    United Kingdom society, with a  reasonable  prospect  of  that  society
    benefiting from the contribution she could make having had a university
    education, the legal restriction on her ability  to  obtain  a  student
    loan by reason of her immigration status was not  rationally  connected
    to the objectives of the student loan legislation.  In any event,  even
    if a bright line rule were justified, the particular  rule  chosen  was
    not  rationally  connected  to  its  aim  or   proportionate   in   its
    achievement.

96. We do not accept Mr Westgate's submissions on the discrimination issue.
     The way in which section 117C(4)(a) has been interpreted by the Higher
    Courts as operating, as between those born in the  United  Kingdom  and
    those not so born, is plainly rational.   Immigration  and  nationality
    law by its very nature ascribes  significance  to  being  born  in  the
    United Kingdom.  The comparison with the legislation considered by  the
    Supreme Court in Tigere is, accordingly, inapt.

97. As we  have  seen,  in  CI  (Nigeria),  Leggatt  LJ  placed  particular
    significance upon the  need  for  Part  5A  "to  provide  a  clear  and
    straightforward set of rules for decision-makers to apply".  To  accept
    the appellant's submissions on discrimination would be to make  section
    117C(4)(a) anything but clear and straightforward.

98. As Mr Kovats submitted, there is, in fact, no  need  to  adopt  such  a
    problematic approach.  As we have already seen  from  paragraph  53  of
    Leggatt LJ's judgment, the answer to this ground of challenge is plain.
      It  lies  in  section  117C(6)  and  its  phrase   "very   compelling
    circumstances".  In NA (Pakistan) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2016] EWCA Civ 662; [2017] Imm AR 1, Jackson  LJ  explained
    how, despite its opening words apparently confining  the  provision  to
    those sentenced to a period of imprisonment of  at  least  four  years,
    section 117C(6) in fact must cover those who had been  sentenced  to  a
    period of imprisonment of at least one year but less  than  four  years
    (the so-called "medium offenders").  Were this not so, there would be a
    risk of section 117C generating decisions that  are  incompatible  with
    United Kingdom's obligations under Article 8 of the ECHR.

99. Accordingly, the inherently case-specific factors prayed in aid by  the
    appellant in respect of his discrimination ground are relevant  to  the
    section 117C(6) exercise, as described by Jackson LJ.

100. It is important to  observe  that  the  operation  of  section  117C(6)
    requires a more nuanced approach to the words  "over  and  above  those
    described in Exceptions 1 and 2", than  might  at  first  be  apparent.
    This emerges from the following paragraphs of Jackson LJ's judgment:-

         "31. An interpretation of  the  relevant  phrase  to  exclude  this
             possibility would lead to  violation  of  Article  8  in  some
             cases, which plainly was not Parliament's intention. In  terms
             of relevance and weight for a proportionality  analysis  under
             Article  8,  the  factors  singled  out  for  description   in
             Exceptions 1 and 2 will apply with  greater  or  lesser  force
             depending on the specific facts of a particular case.  To take
             a simple example in relation to  the  requirement  in  section
             117C(4)(a) for Exception 1, the offender in  question  may  be
             someone aged 37 who came to the UK aged 18 and hence satisfies
             that requirement; but his claim under Article 8 is  likely  to
             be very much weaker than the claim of an offender now aged  80
             who came to the UK aged 6 months, who by dint of  those  facts
             satisfies that requirement.  The circumstances in  the  latter
             case might well be highly relevant  to  whether  it  would  be
             disproportionate and a breach  of  Article  8  to  deport  the
             offender, having regard to the guidance given by the ECtHR  in
             Maslov v Austria [2009] INLR 47, and hence highly relevant  to
             whether there are "very  compelling  circumstances,  over  and
             above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2."

         32.  Similarly, in the case of a medium offender, if all  he  could
             advance in support of his Article 8 claim was  a  "near  miss"
             case in which he fell short of bringing himself within  either
             Exception 1 or Exception 2, it would not be  possible  to  say
             that  he  had  shown  that   there   were   "very   compelling
             circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1
             and 2".  He would need to have a far stronger case  than  that
             by reference to the interests protected by Article 8 to  bring
             himself within that  fall  back  protection.   But  again,  in
             principle there may be cases in which such an offender can say
             that features of his case of a kind described in Exceptions  1
             and 2 have such great force for Article 8 purposes  that  they
             do constitute  such  very  compelling  circumstances,  whether
             taken by themselves  or  in  conjunction  with  other  factors
             relevant to Article 8  but  not  falling  within  the  factors
             described in Exceptions 1 and 2.  The decision  maker,  be  it
             the Secretary of State or a tribunal, must  look  at  all  the
             matters  relied  upon  collectively,  in  order  to  determine
             whether they are sufficiently compelling to outweigh the  high
             public interest in deportation."

101. Thus, to take  the  case  of  CI  (Nigeria)  or  that  of  the  present
    appellant, the fact that the individuals concerned have been unable  to
    satisfy  section  117C(4)(a)  does  not  mean  that   the   "compelling
    circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and  2"
    must be confined to circumstances that are of a conceptually  different
    kind from those analysed as part of the section 117C(4)(a) exercise.

102. This addresses the submission found in paragraph  58  of  the  skeleton
    argument of Mr  Westgate  and  Ms  Cohen,  that  consideration  of  the
    individual's case under section 117C(6)  does  not  avoid  the  alleged
    incompatibility between section 117C(4)(a) and Articles  8/14  "because
    it means that an affected applicant can never come  within  s.117C(4)".
    That submission, with respect, ignores what Jackson LJ said  about  the
    nature of the exercise.

103. The significance of the point made in paragraph  32  of  NA  (Pakistan)
    was expressly recognised by Leggatt LJ at paragraph 93 of CI (Nigeria):-



         "93. It is clear that the  words  "circumstances,  over  and  above
             those described in Exceptions 1 and  2",  which  are  used  in
             section 117C(6) and which the Court of Appeal in NA (Pakistan)
             held are to be read into section 117C(3),  do  not  prevent  a
             person facing deportation  from  relying  on  matters  falling
             within  the  scope  of  the  Exceptions  to  establish   "very
             compelling circumstances" at the second stage of the analysis:
             ..."

104. As can be  seen  from  the  analysis  of  Leggatt  LJ  that  begins  at
    paragraph  94  of  his  judgment,  one  consequence  of   the   correct
    application of section 117C(6) is that it will be wrong for a  Tribunal
    to ignore matters going to  social  and  cultural  integration  in  the
    United Kingdom (section 117C(4)(b)) and whether  there  would  be  very
    significant obstacles to  integration  into  the  country  of  proposed
    deportation  (section  117C(4)(c)),  merely  because   the   individual
    concerned has failed to meet the requirement in section  117C(4)(a)  to
    be lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most of their life.

105. It is clear from paragraph 90 of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision
    that it did not fall into such an error.  On the contrary,  the  First-
    tier Tribunal expressly said that, notwithstanding Exception 1 had been
    found not to apply, it would nevertheless consider  section  117C(4)(b)
    and (c) "because they are relevant to 'very compelling circumstances'".
     At paragraph 92, the First-tier Tribunal came to the  conclusion  that
    the appellant was socially and  culturally  integrated  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  Beginning at paragraph 93, it then went on to examine whether
    there were significant obstacles to integration into Nigeria.   It  was
    at this point that the First-tier Tribunal considered  the  appellant's
    lack of credibility regarding his  alleged  circumstances  in  Nigeria.
    For the reasons we have given, we  do  not  find  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal erred in reaching those findings.  At paragraph 113, the First-
    tier Tribunal was, we find, entitled to its conclusions  that  "on  the
    balance of probabilities ... the appellant has integrated  in  Nigeria"
    and that "he is a young, single man with no  health  problems  who  can
    make his own way in Nigeria".

106. At paragraph 120, the First-tier  Tribunal  reminded  itself  that  the
    test of "very compelling circumstances" was higher than  the  threshold
    of "unduly harsh": Chege (section 117D - Article 8 -  approach)  [2015]
    UKUT 00165 (IAC).  At paragraph 121, following the approach set out  in
    NA (Pakistan), the Tribunal made  a  self-direction  that  all  matters
    relied upon needed to be examined collectively in  order  to  determine
    whether they  were  sufficiently  compelling  to  outweigh  the  public
    interest in deportation.  A  near-miss  under  either  Exception  1  or
    Exception  2  was,  the  Tribunal  said,  insufficient  to   show   the
    circumstances  over  and  above  those  described  in  the  Exceptions;
    "however, in principle, there may be features of the kind described  in
    the Exceptions which have such great force that  they  amount  to  very
    compelling circumstances".

107. It is at this point that the First-tier Tribunal dealt with  the  ECtHR
    case of Maslov v Austria [2009] INLR 47.  The First-tier Tribunal noted
    the key finding at paragraph 75 of Maslov that "for a  settled  migrant
    who has lawfully spent all or the major part of his or her childhood or
    youth in the host country, very serious reasons are required to justify
    expulsion".

108. Maslov was extensively  considered  by  Leggatt  LJ  in  CI  (Nigeria),
    beginning at paragraph 103.  At paragraph 109, he noted that the Maslov
    principle, as articulated at paragraph 75 of the ECtHR's  judgment,  is
    not applicable to "criminal offenders who are unlawfully present in the
    UK".  Leggatt LJ then turned to the correct approach in respect of that
    part of paragraph 75 which concerns a person having "lawfully spent all
    or the major part of his  or  her  childhood  and  youth  in  the  host
    country":-

         "110.    ... however, CI is not unlawfully present in the  UK.   He
             has  indefinite  leave  to  remain  and  is  thus  a  "settled
             migrant", as that expression has been used in the case law  of
             the European Court.  On the other hand, he has not  spent  all
             or the major part of his childhood and youth lawfully  in  the
             UK, and therefore does not fall within the description in para
             75 of the Maslov judgment.  This raises the question  whether,
             as  the  Upper  Tribunal  judge  in  this  case  thought,  the
             principles stated in Maslov (and, in particular,  para  75  of
             the judgment) are inapplicable because they  are  confined  to
             settled migrants who have had that status - or who at any rate
             have been lawfully present in the host country - for  most  of
             their childhood.

         111. In my view, the relevance of the Maslov case (and other  cases
             in the same line of authority) is not limited in this way.  In
             the first place,  it  would  be  wrong  to  read  the  court's
             judgment in that case as if it were a  legislative  text.   As
             discussed by Sir Stanley  Burnton  (with  whom  McFarlane  and
             Maurice Kay LJJ agreed) in R (Akpinar) v Upper Tribunal [2014]
             EWCA Civ 937; [2015] 1 WLR 466, paras 30-54, the statement  in
             para 75 of the  Maslov  judgment  about  the  need  for  "very
             serious reasons" is not to be read as laying down a  new  rule
             of law but rather as indicating the way in which the balancing
             exercise should be approached in  the  circumstances  of  that
             case.  As Sir Stanley Burnton pointed out, this  is  confirmed
             by  the  way  in  which  the  court  expressed  its   ultimate
             conclusion in para 100 of the judgment that there had  been  a
             violation of article 8 in that case:


                  "Having  regard  to  the  foregoing   considerations,   in
                  particular the - with one exception -  non-violent  nature
                  of the offences committed when a  minor  and  the  State's
                  duty to facilitate his  reintegration  into  society,  the
                  length of the applicant's lawful residence in Austria, his
                  family, social and linguistic ties with  Austria  and  the
                  lack of proven ties with his country of origin, the  Court
                  finds that the imposition of an exclusion order, even of a
                  limited duration, was disproportionate to  the  legitimate
                  aim pursued, 'the prevention of disorder or crime'. ..."
             This was a conventional balancing  exercise,  with  no  bright
             line rule applied in relation to the length of the applicant's
             lawful residence in Austria.
         112. Secondly, as I have indicated, the  distinction  of  principle
             drawn in the case law of the European  Court  is  between  the
             expulsion of a person who has no right  of  residence  in  the
             host country on the one hand and, on the other hand, expulsion
             which  involves  the  withdrawal  of  a  right  of   residence
             previously granted.  There is no such distinction of principle
             between a  person  who  has  spent  most  of  their  childhood
             lawfully in the UK and someone who has  spent  part  but  less
             than half of their childhood living in the  country  lawfully.
             The difference is one of weight and degree.  Such a difference
             is compatible with adopting the condition specified in section
             117C(4)(a) that a foreign criminal has been lawfully  resident
             in the UK for most of his life as a prima  facie  requirement.
             But  it  would  not   be   consistent   with   the   test   of
             proportionality under article 8, which  involves  a  balancing
             exercise, to treat the principles stated in the Maslov case as
             inapplicable to a settled migrant with a  right  of  residence
             just because the individual concerned, although present in the
             country  since  early  childhood,  has  not  had  a  right  of
             residence for a particular length or proportion of their  time
             in the host country.

         113. Third, as  discussed  above,  although  little  weight  should
             generally be given to a private life established when a person
             was present in  the  UK  unlawfully  or  without  a  right  of
             permanent residence, it would not (as the Upper Tribunal judge
             recognised) be fair to adopt this approach on  the  particular
             facts of this case, where the grant  of  indefinite  leave  to
             remain was delayed for many years when CI was a child  for  no
             good reason and through  no  fault  of  his.   In  determining
             whether it is compatible with article 8 to deport him from the
             UK, CI should not in  these  circumstances  have  less  weight
             accorded to the fact that he has spent his childhood and youth
             in the UK than would be the case if he had had a vested  right
             of residence for most of that period.

         114. I therefore consider that the Upper Tribunal  judge  erred  in
             regarding the principles established in Maslov as inapplicable
             in the present case because CI was not a settled  migrant  for
             most of his childhood."

109. The First-tier Tribunal dealt with Maslov as follows:-

         "125.    The passage from Maslov [i.e. the finding at paragraph  75
             of the ECtHR's judgment] is mentioned at [51] of  Akinyemi  as
             having been referred to in Hesham Ali at [26] per Lord Reed to
             the effect that the deportation of a person in his 30s who was
             born in the host country and had never left it was  very  hard
             to justify as proportionate.  Of course, whilst he came  as  a
             very young child, the appellant was not born here  and  as  we
             understand Akinyemi and Hesham  Ali,  there  were  no  adverse
             credibility findings against the appellants  in  those  cases,
             such as we have made against the appellant."

110. We agree with Mr  Westgate  that,  at  paragraph  125,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal fell into legal  error.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  must,  we
    consider, be taken to have decided that the  Maslov  principle  had  no
    application at all to the appellant because he  was  not  born  in  the
    United Kingdom and/or because  he  had  been  the  subject  of  adverse
    credibility findings by the Tribunal.  So far  as  being  born  in  the
    United Kingdom is concerned, there is nothing in paragraph 26  of  Lord
    Reed's judgment in Hesham Ali that suggests Maslov is to be interpreted
    by United Kingdom courts and tribunals as applying only to  those  born
    in the host country.  On the contrary,  in  that  paragraph  Lord  Reed
    said:-

         "... when assessing the length of a person's stay  in  the  country
         from which he or she is to be expelled  and  the  solidity  of  the
         social, cultural and family ties with the host country, it makes  a
         difference whether the person came to the country during his or her
         childhood or youth, or was even born there, or whether  he  or  she
         only came as an adult ...".

111. We also agree  with  Mr  Westgate  that  adverse  credibility  findings
    cannot rob a person of the benefit of Maslov, unless, of course,  those
    findings show that, in reality, there is no factual basis for that case
    to apply.

112. In the present case,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  accordingly  erred  in
    finding that Maslov could not increase  the  weight  that  fell  to  be
    placed on the appellant's side of the proportionality balance.  We have
    considered whether this error can be said to be material.  Reading  the
    decision  as  whole  and,  in  particular,  the  passages  that  follow
    paragraph 125, we have concluded it is not possible  to  say  that  the
    decision would have been bound to have been the same, had the error not
    occurred.

113. As can be seen from the foregoing analysis, the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal does not fall to be disturbed on the grounds of Article 8
    procedural unfairness  or  because  of  any  error  in  the  Tribunal's
    findings as to  credibility.   Although  we  have  concluded  that  the
    decision must be set aside, this is only in respect of  the  Tribunal's
    Article 8 proportionality exercise, by reference  to  section  117C(6).
    The Tribunal's findings of fact stand.

114. In  those  circumstances,  the  nature  and  extent  of  the  re-making
    exercise are such that the exercise should  take  place  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  Both parties will, of course, be permitted to file and serve
    evidence relating to the position, as at the date  of  the  forthcoming
    hearing.  The re-making will be conducted by Upper Tribunal Judges Pitt
    and Blum, for  which  purpose  we  hereby  transfer  conduct  of  those
    proceedings to them.

115. In view of our decision, it is unnecessary to address  the  appellant's
    amended ground, which  criticises  the  way  in  which  the  First-tier
    Tribunal approached the significance  of  the  appellant's  offence  of
    child abduction.  It will be for  the  Upper  Tribunal,  following  the
    forthcoming hearing, to determine the significance to be given to  that
    offence, in undertaking the section 117C(6) exercise.

Decision

116. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
    error of law.  The decision is, accordingly, set aside  to  the  extent
    described above.  The Upper Tribunal will re-make the decision  in  the
    appeal, as explained above.
