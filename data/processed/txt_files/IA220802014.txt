For the Respondent:        Ms J Isherwood (Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Salamat Hussain, a citizen of Pakistan born  10
       September 1976, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal of  7
       November 2016 dismissing his appeal against the refusal to  vary  his
       leave from Post Study Worker to Tier 1 Entrepreneur,  itself  brought
       against a Home Office decision of 7 May 2014 to such effect.


    2. The refusal letter sets out his immigration history: he  was  granted
       leave to enter as a student on 24 September 2008, ultimately until 30
       September 2012, and then as a Tier 1  post  study  migrant  until  27
       February 2014. He made an application for leave as an Entrepreneur on
       25 February 2014, and was interviewed  regarding  the  matter  on  28
       April 2014.


    3. His application was refused  because  the  Home  Office  doubted  the
       genuineness of his proposed business, because


      a) There was inadequate evidence as to the source of the funds
         underlying his investment into the business, which he asserted had
         come from the sale of land, but as to which there appeared to be
         no corroborative evidence;

      b) The funds had not been invested into a UK business;

      c) His business plan repeatedly contained text which had been
         plagiarised from online sources showing that it "clearly cannot
         have been written with the intention of it truly and accurately
         representing your business";

      d) The contract between his company and Khans Kebabs Ltd, the sole
         contract provided on the application, contained no information as
         to the cost of the services that would be provided;

      e) Although he had named a series of competitor businesses local to
         his own, he had not explained how it was that his own claim to
         provide excellent customer service and reasonable prices would
         exceed their ability to do so;

      f) An internet search on Yell.com showed that some 150 firms in the
         LU3 residential postcode offered "management consultancy"
         services;

      g) Whilst he was given credit for his MBA from the University of
         Wales and his work as a Business Development Manager which could
         reasonably be expected to provide him with some transferable
         skills on which to build, he lacked previous business experience
         inside or outside the UK.



    4. His appeal was first heard and dismissed by the  First-tier  Tribunal
       on 15 September 2015. The First-tier Tribunal accepted  his  evidence
       regarding the availability of the relevant investment sum, as he  had
       "now produced an estate agent's valuation report and a sale agreement
       for a plot of land in Pakistan" and documentation showing he  had  by
       otherwise transferred �23,650 from Pakistan to the United Kingdom  of
       which he had invested �18,000 in his proposed business. However,  the
       "great many documents" now put before the First-tier Tribunal gave it
       additional concerns about the genuineness of the business: there  was
       no satisfactory explanation for why a small kebab takeaway would  pay
       �600 a month for his services, and similarly as  to  why  a  security
       company would pay �12,000 annually or why  Best  Business  Centre,  a
       small travel agent and currency exchange,  would  pay  �650  monthly.
       Furthermore, the invoices he had put forward did not tally  with  the
       sums charged  under  the  contracts  he  had  provided.  Furthermore,
       notwithstanding his business qualification, he  had  been  unable  to
       explain these issues, which also counted against him.


    5. Permission to appeal was granted against that decision and the  Upper
       Tribunal remitted the appeal for hearing afresh,  having  found  that
       the First-tier Tribunal had failed to indicate the extent to which it
       had relied  upon  post-decision  evidence  as  opposed  to  upon  the
       material supplied on the application, both directly  and  via  taking
       account of the Appellant's oral evidence which had referred  to  such
       material.


    6. The First-tier Tribunal reheard  the  Appellant's  appeal  and  again
       dismissed it in a  decision  of  23  November  2016.  It  refused  an
       adjournment  application  made  on  the  basis  of  the   Appellant's
       difficulties with a hearing problem, back pain and depression because
       there was nothing to indicate he was unable to give  evidence  before
       the Tribunal.


    7. Having noted that the parties agreed that all the evidence now before
       the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  admissible  having  been  before  the
       Respondent's  decision  maker  (save  for   the   witness   statement
       evidence), the First-tier Tribunal went on to summarise the  evidence
       the Appellant had given at interview in some detail, and then  stated
       it gave "significant weight" to his  registration  of  his  business,
       opening of bank accounts, and provision of a service agreement and  a
       business plan. It upheld the reasoning of the Respondent on the basis
       that:


      a) He had been unable to detail of the services that his business
         would have offered or the agreed costs with Khan's Kebabs;
      b) He was vague as to his business's competitiveness;
      c) The use of template business plans was not of itself
         objectionable, but nevertheless the Home Office had been right
         here to have some concern about the extent to which material had
         been copied from the internet;
      d) The Service Agreement was invalid as it referenced agreed payment
         rates which were in fact not ultimately outlined therein;

      e) The Appellant lacked experience in running a business, and,
         recognising that any entrepreneur had to start somewhere,
         management consultancy of all businesses was surely one in which
         experience would be at a premium.



    8. Having regard to these considerations, the First-tier Tribunal  found
       that "I then consider whether the oral evidence and written statement
       of the Appellant  is  such  to  satisfy  me  that  he  is  a  genuine
       entrepreneur. It does not. He again provided only vague  evidence  as
       to the services he intends to supply and the fees with Khan's Kebabs.
       He provided inconsistent evidence as to whether he had ever  intended
       to charge fees up front."


    9. Before me Mr  Parkin  submitted  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
       essentially erred on this occasion just as its predecessor had  done;
       it had entertained and considered oral evidence, which  by  its  very
       nature  was  inevitably  post-decision  material,  contrary  to   the
       statutory scheme as interpreted in Ahmed. The Upper Tribunal could no
       more separate out any reasoning on this occasion that  was  based  on
       material provided on the application than post-decision evidence than
       on the last occasion. Whilst the parties had agreed in  the  Tribunal
       below that oral evidence was admissible, that  was  before  the  full
       implications of the strictures of Ahmed had not been appreciated.


Findings and reasons

   10. The Immigration Rules relevant to this application are  found  within
       Part 6A of the Rules addressing the Points Based System.


         "245DD. Requirements for leave to remain
         To qualify for leave to remain as a Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant
         under this rule, an applicant must  meet  the  requirements  listed
         below. If the applicant meets these requirements, leave  to  remain
         will be granted. If the applicant does not meet these requirements,
         the application will be refused.
         Requirements: ...
         (h) Except where the applicant has, or was last granted, leave as a
         Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant, a Businessperson or an Innovator and
         is being assessed under Table 5 of Appendix  A,  the  Secretary  of
         State must be satisfied that:
         (i) the applicant genuinely:
         (1) intends and is  able  to  establish,  take  over  or  become  a
         director of one or more businesses in the UK within  the  next  six
         months, or
         ...
         (i) In making the assessment in (h), the Secretary  of  State  will
         assess the balance of probabilities. The  Secretary  of  State  may
         take into account the following factors:
           (i) the evidence the applicant has submitted;
           (ii) the viability and credibility of the source  of  the  money
           referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A;
           (iii) the viability and credibility of the applicant's  business
           plans and market research into their chosen business sector;
           (iv)  the  applicant's   previous   educational   and   business
           experience (or lack thereof) ..."


   11. In Ahmed and Another (PBS: admissible evidence) [2014] UKUT 365 (IAC)
       the Upper Tribunal ruled that where a provision of the Rules (such as
       that in para 245DD(k)) provides that points will not  be  awarded  if
       the decision-maker  is  not  satisfied  as  to  another  (non-points-
       scoring) aspect of the Rule, the non-points-scoring  aspect  and  the
       requirement for points are inextricably  linked;  as  a  result,  the
       prohibition  on  new  evidence  in  s  85A(4)  of  the   Nationality,
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  applies  to  the  non-points-scoring
       aspect of the rule: the prohibition is in relation  to  new  evidence
       that goes to  the  scoring  of  points.  The  reasoning  therein  was
       effectively upheld in Olatunde [2015] EWCA Civ 670.


   12. The Appellant has  already  had  the  theoretical  advantage  of  one
       constitution of the  First-tier  Tribunal  taking  account  of  post-
       decision evidence to make good the shortfalls in his  application  as
       put to  the  Home  Office,  albeit  that  the  evidence  in  question
       ultimately counted against him rather than in his  favour.  His  case
       before the First-tier Tribunal was clearly ineptly presented  on  the
       first occasion the appeal was heard, otherwise the  judge  would  not
       have fallen into such an obvious error. This time round,  the  First-
       tier Tribunal was astute to identity which documents were before  the
       original decision maker before embarking  on  its  enquiry  into  the
       credibility of the Appellant's application.


   13. There is no doubt that  the  response  of  the  Judge  below  to  the
       material before him was  to  be  very  critical  of  its  cogency  in
       rebutting the Home Office assertion that his application  was  not  a
       viable one.


   14. Although the grounds of appeal alleged  that  the  reasoning  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal was  perverse,  inadequately  reasoned,  or  gave
       uncertain weight  to  particular  factors,  Mr  Parkin  only  faintly
       pressed those criticisms before me. He was right to do so: in reality
       the findings  made  were  perfectly  cogent,  and  I  can  detect  no
       irrationality or failure to take matters into account within them.


   15. Although not every entrepreneur will be able to  recall  chapter  and
       verse of their business plan, it cannot be said  that  vague  answers
       must nevertheless be accepted as  satisfactory.  One  can  reasonably
       expect an entrepreneur to have a distinct sense of  their  business's
       unique selling points when measured against extant competitors;  here
       the Appellant's answers at interview  had  been  unsatisfactory.  The
       Rules unsurprisingly identify past  experience  as  relevant  to  the
       assessment of the  viability  of  a  prospective  business.  Material
       omissions of relevant material  such  as  payment  rates  in  service
       contracts tends to undermine a claim that they are  indicative  of  a
       viable business. Reasoning of this nature is certainly not beyond the
       legitimate range of responses that  might  have  been  taken  to  the
       Appellant's case.


   16. I accordingly find that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  was,
       subject to the question of taking account of post-decision  evidence,
       wholly lawful.


   17. It seems to me that when it came to assess  the  Appellant's  witness
       statement and oral evidence, it did so with a view to seeing  whether
       that material overcame the objections to his case that it had already
       identified, rather  than  taking  that  post-decision  material  into
       account as part of its original reasoning. Accordingly though it  was
       wrong to enter into that enquiry, no material  error  of  law  arises
       from it having done so.


   18. There is also the question of the adjournment  application  that  was
       refused. Given that it is now accepted that the  oral  evidence  that
       the Respondent was ultimately to give was not relevant on the appeal,
       nothing arises from the concerns originally expressed that his health
       might have affected the  manner  in  which  he  gave  such  evidence.
       Besides, the approach the First-tier Tribunal  took  to  the  medical
       evidence before it was perfectly reasonable.


          Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain  any  material
    error of law and stands. The appeal is dismissed.


 Signed:                                           Date: 7 July 2017
