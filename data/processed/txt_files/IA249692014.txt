Representation:

For the Appellant:           Mr A Alexander, Counsel, instructed by Haslaw
& Co Limited
For the Respondent:    Miss A Brocklesby-Weller, Senior Home Office
                       Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Thailand, born on 4 September  1970,  and
    she made an application on 13 May 2014 to remain as  the  spouse  of  a
    person present and settled in the United Kingdom, that being  Mr  Peter
    Chung.  The application was refused on 13 May 2014  and  the  appellant
    appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The matter came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Nicholls who dismissed
    the appeal under the Immigration Rules further to paragraph  D-LTRP.1.3
    and R-LTRP.1.1(d) of Appendix FM.  It was accepted that  the  appellant
    had a relationship with a British citizen but found that she could  not
    have the benefit of Exception EX.1 because there were no insurmountable
    obstacles to her family life continuing in Thailand.

 3. An application for permission to appeal was made on the basis  that  it
    was argued that Judge Nicholls had erred in law in that the  judge  had
    failed to take into account the  extent  to  which  the  appellant  had
    established her private and family life in the UK and  failed  to  take
    into account the fact that she had entered the  UK  on  a  spouse  visa
    valid from 10 January 2012 to 10 April 2014 granting 27  months'  valid
    leave.  The visa was granted before 9 July 2012, that is before the new
    Rules came into place, (demanding that the  sponsoring  spouse  had  to
    prove that he  was  earning  ï¿½18,600  per  annum)  and  therefore  this
    requirement under the Rules did not apply.  The appellant  stated  that
    the new Rule did not apply to her as she was granted  her  visa  on  10
    January 2012.

 4. She had instructed Malik and Malik Solicitors to submit an  application
    under the old Rules  for  which  she  qualified  but  they  negligently
    submitted an  incorrect  application  LR(FP)  for  which  she  did  not
    qualify.

 5. It was submitted that on the day of the hearing  Counsel  attempted  to
    explain this mistake to the judge but the judge  failed  to  take  this
    into account.   The  appellant  was  filing  a  complaint  against  the
    solicitors.  She submitted that she  was  married  to  Peter  Chung,  a
    British national, who had spent more than four decades in this  country
    and had got his own restaurant which he and the appellant ran together.
     If they returned to Thailand they had no resources as she had invested
    a huge sum of money in a take-away business in the UK.  She also  noted
    that she qualified for the requirements of SET.M.

 6. In relation to Article 8 the appellant asserted that she had  developed
    a secure life for herself surrounded by family and friends and  adopted
    the British lifestyle.  She had not breached any Immigration  Rule  and
    her life would be severely interfered with.

 7. Previously in this matter, I found an error of law in relation  to  the
    decision of Judge Nicholls because in the analysis  of  Article  8  the
    judge merely stated "Nevertheless, the evidence I find does not  reveal
    any factors which are not  properly  assessed  within  the  Immigration
    Rules".  The First-tier Tribunal Judge acknowledged that Counsel argued
    that there was an exceptional  circumstance,  because  the  application
    submitted by the appellant was in fact on the wrong  grounds,  and  the
    point was raised that the appellant could  have applied for  indefinite
    leave to remain in the UK and that she had been  wrongly  advised,  but
    the Judge did not take this into account when  considering  an  overall
    compelling reason to consider the  matter  outside  the  rules  and  in
    relation to the overall assessment in proportionality.  There  appeared
    to be no attempt to incorporate the fact that the  respondent  did  not
    apply the transitional provisions  of  Appendix  FM  to  the  applicant
    because she had applied on the  wrong  form.   It  would  be  therefore
    difficult to discern how the  public  interest  was  measured  and  the
    balance to be weighed between public and private interest.  I therefore
    found an error of law which was material in respect of  the  Article  8
    assessment.

 8. There was an indication that there had  been  a  change  in  solicitors
    since the application for  permission  to  appeal  and  the  solicitors
    needed time to obtain the file from the previous solicitors in order to
    present the matter further.  I therefore granted an adjournment.

 9. At the resumed hearing before me Ms Brocklesby-Weller, very sensibly in
    my view, agreed that the Secretary of State should not have  taken  the
    point that the appellant  applied  on  the  wrong  form  and  that  the
    appellant would now fall for limited leave to remain under the previous
    Paragraph 284 of the Immigration Rules.  She conceded that  the  appeal
    should be allowed on the basis that the appellant had leave as a spouse
    prior to the enactments under Appendix FM and she  should  be  able  to
    take advantage of the transitional provisions.  I therefore  allow  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules.

10. For the record, Mr Alexander indicated that the appellant had now taken
    and passed the Life in the United Kingdom test.

Notice of Decision

11. Appeal Allowed under the Immigration Rules.


Signed                                             Date 21st December 2015

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Rimington



Fee Award

In the light of the decision to re-make the decision in the appeal,  I  have
considered whether to make a fee award (rule 23A (costs) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005  and  section  12(4)(a)  of  the
Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007). I have had regard to the  Joint
Presidential Guidance Note: Fee  Awards  in  Immigration  Appeals  (December
2011). I make a whole fee award as the appellant has been successful in  all
aspects of her appeal.
