Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Ngwudcha, instructed by Carl Martin solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 1 May 1962 who has  been
      in the UK since May 2004. His leave to remain expired in 2006.

   2. Whilst in the UK the appellant committed several  offences,  the  most
      significant of which was battery for which  he  was  sentenced  to  10
      weeks imprisonment in 2014.

   3. The appellant has four children: [A], born on 26  October  1999;  [V],
      born on 19 February 2001; [B], born on 28 March 2011; and [O], born on
      20 March 2007.

   4. On 5 November 2016 the appellant applied for leave to  remain  on  the
      basis of his family and private life. His  application  was  rejected.
      The respondent did not accept that he had  a  genuine  and  subsisting
      relationship with his children. It was noted that the children are  in
      the care of their mother and that by court order he was prevented from
      parental access/contact with [B] and [O]. It was also noted that there
      was no evidence of contact with [V] and only a few documents to show a
      relationship with [A].

   5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal where his appeal was
      heard by Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Lucas.  In  a  decision
      promulgated on 24 May  2019,  the  judge  dismissed  the  appeal.  The
      appellant is now appealing against that decision.

   6. The judge found that there was insufficient  evidence  before  him  to
      accept that the appellant plays a role in  the  life  of,  or  has  an
      ongoing or active relationship with,  his  children.  The  judge  also
      found that the appellant has no other basis to be in  the  UK,  as  an
      overstayer with criminal convictions.

   7. The grounds of appeal argue that the judge failed to consider  whether
      the appellant has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship  with
      his children for the purposes of section 117B(6)  of  the  Nationality
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act"). It  is  also  argued
      that the judge had  regard  to  parental  misconduct  contrary  to  KO
      (Nigeria) & Ors v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2018]
      UKSC 53.

   8. Mr Ngwudcha argued that the decision is flawed because of a failure to
      make precise findings about the appellant's parental relationship with
      his children, who are qualifying children. He argued  that  the  judge
      accepted the appellant is the father of the children and that he lived
      with them until July 2016 and he submitted  that  there  was  evidence
      before the judge showing a relationship with the children.

   9. Ms Everett argued that the judge gave cogent reasons for not accepting
      that the evidence before him established that there was a genuine  and
      subsisting parental relationship. She also observed that [A] was  over
      18 at the time of the hearing and therefore not a qualifying child.

  10. Section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act provides that:
           "(6)     In the case of a person who is not liable to
           deportation, the public interest does not require the person's
           removal where -
                 (a)       the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
                 relationship with a qualifying child, and
                 (b)       it would not be reasonable to expect the child to
                 leave the United Kingdom."
  11. A "qualifying child" is defined as a person under the age of 18 who is
      a British citizen, or has lived in the United Kingdom for a continuous
      period of seven years or more.

  12. In order to bring himself within the  ambit  of  section  117B(6)  the
      appellant needed to  show  that  he  had  a  "genuine  and  subsisting
      parental relationship" with a qualifying child.

  13. [A] was not a qualifying child at the time of the First-tier  Tribunal
      hearing as she was over 18. Mr Ngwudcha argued that [A] was  under  18
      when the application was made. This, however, is irrelevant. The judge
      was required to assess the position at the date of the hearing; and at
      that date [A]  was  not  a  qualifying  child  due  to  her  age.  The
      appellant's other three children were qualifying children.

  14. The Court of Appeal confirmed in  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department v AB  (Jamaica)  &  Anor  [2019]  EWCA  Civ  661  that  the
      assessment of whether there is a parental relationship is highly  fact
      sensitive, and will involve consideration of the actual role  -  as  a
      parent - played in the child's life. A parent can have a  genuine  and
      subsisting parental relationship even when they  do  not  provide  any
      direct parental  care  and  have  only  limited  contact.  Indeed,  as
      observed by Lady Justice King in AB, a parent could have a genuine and
      subsisting parental relationship even absent direct contact.

  15. Although the judge did not refer to section 117B(6) or make a specific
      finding as to whether the appellant  had  a  "genuine  and  subsisting
      parental relationship," he did consider the evidence before  him  that
      was relevant  to  the  relationship  between  the  appellant  and  his
      children and he found at paragraph 26 that there was  little  reliable
      evidence to show "any significant ongoing or active relationship".

  16. Mr Ngwudcha argued that the judge's findings - and the evidence - does
      not support the conclusion that there is not a genuine and  subsisting
      relationship. I disagree. As submitted by Ms Everett, there  was  very
      little evidence before the judge. The evidence concerning [B] and  [O]
      indicated that contact was prohibited. The only evidence regarding [V]
      was a short letter supporting his application for leave dated 27  June
      2015. Mr  Ngwudcha  drew  my  attention  to  correspondence  from  the
      appellant's church stating that the appellant is happily married and a
      great father to his four children but this letter was written in  June
      2015. Given the paucity of evidence to establish  that  the  appellant
      had a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with  any  of  his  three
      qualifying children, the judge  was  entitled  to  find  that  section
      117B(6) was not applicable.

  17. Mr Ngwudcha argued that, following  KO,  parental  conduct  cannot  be
      taken  into  consideration  when  assessing  the   reasonableness   of
      expecting a qualifying child to leave the UK. This is correct, but  it
      is also irrelevant.  In  the  absence  of  a  genuine  and  subsisting
      parental relationship there was no need to consider the reasonableness
      of expecting a child to leave the UK as section 117B(6)  of  the  2002
      Act could not apply.
