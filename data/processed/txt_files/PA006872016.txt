                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                                 DIRECTIONS

 1. The Appellant has been  granted  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal against  a  decision  of  judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Eldridge promulgated on 24 April 2017.

 2. On 02 October 2017 the Upper  Tribunal  received  a  letter,  dated  28
    September 2017, from the Appellant's representatives indicating that he
    wished to withdraw his appeal and that he has now left the country.

 3. Paragraph 17 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
    provides for a party to withdraw its case  before  the  Upper  Tribunal
    only with the consent of the Tribunal. If the Tribunal does so  consent
    this would amount to a final disposal of the appeal  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 4. In light of the letter from the  Appellant's  legal  representatives  I
    consent to him withdrawing his case before the Upper Tribunal.
