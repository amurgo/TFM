                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Entry Clearance Officer appeals against the determination of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Graham that  was  promulgated  on  28  March  2014.
    Judge Graham  allowed  Mr  Mahmood's  appeal  against  the  immigration
    decision of 19 December 2012 refusing entry clearance to  him  to  join
    his wife who is present and settled in the UK.

 2. As the application for entry clearance was made on  4  July  2012,  the
    immigration rules that apply to this appeal remain those in force on  8
    July 2012 (as per  paragraphs  A277  and  A280(c)  of  the  immigration
    rules).

 3. Judge Graham cited the relevant provisions  of  paragraph  281  in  her
    determination,  identifying  that  the  reasons  for   refusing   entry
    clearance were limited to: (i) whether Mr Mahmood's spouse was  present
    and  settled  in  the  UK  and  (ii)  whether  the   English   language
    requirements were met and (iii) whether the marriage was subsisting and
    whether  the  parties  to  the  marriage  intended  to  live   together
    permanently.

 4. The Presenting Officer who represented the ECO at the hearing  conceded
    that the first issue was resolved in Mr Mahmood's favour as his  wife's
    passport showed she had been granted indefinite leave to remain in  the
    UK.   Regarding  the  third  issue,  Judge  Graham   found   that   the
    relationship between Mr Mahmood and his wife was  subsisting  and  that
    the couple intended to live together permanently as husband  and  wife.
    Judge Graham gave detailed and cogent reasons for making  that  finding
    and it is unchallenged on appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

 5. It is the second issue that is the focus of the  ECO's  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.  Judge Graham recorded that there was a dispute  as  to
    whether Mr Mahmood could rely on an English test certificate  from  EMD
    International English Language Assessment dated 20 December 2010.

 6. For convenience, we set out the  immigration  rules  that  we  have  to
    consider  in  light  of  the  disputed  issue  in  the  annex  to  this
    determination.

 7. Before hearing from Mr Mills and Mr Khan, we thought it appropriate  to
    give our views on some of the issues arising in this appeal.

 8. At the hearing in  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  Presenting  Officer
    argued that at the date of decision EMD was not on the approved list of
    English test providers.  Judge Graham recorded this submission and also
    noted that the Presenting Officer was unable to say whether or not  EMD
    had been on  the  approved  list  when  the  test  was  taken  and  the
    certificate issued.  The Presenting Officer conceded that had EMD  been
    an approved test provider at the date of application then  transitional
    arrangements would have applied and entry  clearance  would  have  been
    granted.

 9. Judge  Graham  took  into  consideration  what  she  was  told  by  the
    presenting officer, that it was impossible to  obtain  a  copy  of  the
    approved list as at the date of application.  She found this undermined
    the reasons for refusal insofar as the wrong law had been applied to Mr
    Mahmood.  In addition, Judge Graham took into  consideration  the  fact
    that in a previous application for entry clearance as  a  spouse  there
    had been no dispute as to whether Mr Mahmood met the  English  language
    requirements of the immigration rules even though the same  rules  were
    in force and the refusal was appealed.

10. The grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal  argue  that  Judge  Graham
    erred in law in a number of ways.  First, that she reversed the  burden
    of proof in that she required the Secretary of State (sic)  to  provide
    evidence that Mr Mahmood did not satisfy  the  immigration  rules.   Of
    course, this was an appeal against the ECO and  not  the  Secretary  of
    State and we presume that the reference to the Secretary  of  State  in
    the grounds of appeal is merely an administrative error.

11. In any event, this argument misreads the determination.   Judge  Graham
    merely points out that the Presenting Officer could not provide the law
    as it was at the date of application and therefore could not show  that
    EMD was not on the approved list of English test providers.   This  did
    not reverse the  burden  of  proof.   It  simply  identified  that  the
    Presenting Officer could not assist and thought that the law as it  was
    at the date of application was not traceable.

12. The second ground of appeal is of more substance.  It argues  that  the
    relevant date is the date of decision and that it was for Mr Mahmood to
    show that at that date he  met  the  English  language  requirement  by
    producing a certificate from an approved test  provider.   This  ground
    also alleges that the list of approved test providers as at the date of
    application was available and a copy was provided.

13. We mention that the grounds of appeal describe the date of  application
    as being 12 July 2012 whereas it was in fact 4 July 2012.  Nothing  can
    turn on this point because  the  immigration  rules  were  not  amended
    insofar as they applied to Mr Mahmood between these dates.  As we  have
    indicated, because his application was made on 4 July 2012, it  was  to
    be decided in accordance with the immigration rules in force on 8  July
    2012.  The transitional provisions also mean that neither the  ECO  nor
    Judge Graham nor the Upper Tribunal can  have  regard  to  any  of  the
    changes made to the immigration rules after that date.

14.  In  this  regard  we  begin  our  consideration  by  noting  that  the
    immigration rules did not contain a  list  of  those  English  language
    tests that had been assessed as meeting the Home  Office  requirements.
    Such a list was first introduced into the immigration rules on 20  July
    2012 when the Statement of  Changes  to  Immigration  Rules  (Cm  8423)
    inserted appendix O.

15. Prior to those changes, the list of approved testers was contained in a
    policy document.  We do not have to  rehearse  the  status  of  such  a
    policy document; it was not possible for  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    bring into effect immigration rules via policy (see R (Alvi and others)
    v SSHD [2012] UKSC 33, [2012] Imm AR 998).  But this general  point  is
    not of relevance to the appeal before us.

16. The issue for us is whether Judge Graham erred on a  point  of  law  by
    accepting that it was  not  possible  to  obtain  a  list  of  approved
    testers.  The ECO has now  provided  various  lists  of  approved  test
    providers.  The only relevant list is the one that existed prior  to  9
    July 2012 and which was in place on 8 July 2012.  As we have indicated,
    it is in the form of a policy document.  The other lists all  refer  to
    amendments to the immigration rules that cannot apply  in  this  appeal
    because of the transitional provisions.

17. We note that EMD (English Management Direct) is listed  in  the  policy
    document as an approved tester.  The entry is as follows:

18. There is no explanation as to why the policy document was not  provided
    to Judge Graham.  Nor is  there  any  explanation  why  the  Presenting
    Officer  conceded  that  such  a  list  was  not  available.   In  such
    circumstances we are of the view that Judge Graham was entitled to find
    that the wrong law had been applied at the date of decision.  The  fact
    that the ECO now seeks to withdraw a concession is  immaterial  to  the
    issue before us as the matter has been the subject of adjudication  and
    we can only interfere if there is legal error.

19. Even if we are wrong,  it  follows  from  all  we  have  discussed  and
    considered that at the date of decision the ECO had to have  regard  to
    the immigration rules as they were at 8 July 2012.  At that  date,  EMD
    was an approved tester, EMD being listed in the  Secretary  of  State's
    policy document.  As such, any legal error would be immaterial  to  the
    outcome.

20. Mr Mills accepted that policy cannot be  used  as  a  requirement.   He
    continued to argue that  the  relevant  date  should  be  the  date  of
    decision but acknowledged the transitional  provisions  we  identified.
    Mr Khan reverted to his  skeleton  argument,  which  we  noted  was  in
    similar terms to what we had discussed.

21. In light of our discussion, we are satisfied that the grounds of appeal
    are not made out and the ECO's appeal must fail.  In so doing we uphold
    Judge Graham's decision that the refusal of entry clearance was not  in
    accordance with the immigration rules.

Decision

The determination of Judge Graham does not contain an error on  a  point  of
law and is upheld.
