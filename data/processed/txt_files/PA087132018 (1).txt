Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr B Hawkin, Counsel instructed by Oaks Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms K Pal, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Albania.  She was born on [~] 1980.  She
    arrived in the United Kingdom on  29  July  2012  and  made  an  asylum
    application on 24 June 2013.  This claim was certified as unfounded and
    refused but following further submissions  and  a  judicial  review,  a
    decision was made on 27 June 2018 refusing her leave to remain but with
    the right of appeal.

 2. The basis of the Appellant's claim is that she feared return to Albania
    as a single woman with illegitimate children, that there is a  lack  of
    sufficiency  of  protection  and  she  would  not  safely  be  able  to
    internally relocate.  The reason that she had fled Albania is that  she
    did not want to marry a person of her family's choosing as a result  of
    which she was ill-treated and beaten by her family.  She  then  escaped
    and fled to the United Kingdom in order to be reunited with an Albanian
    national whom she had met in Albania and who had  come  to  the  United
    Kingdom.  She had since given birth to two children, a son  on  15  May
    2013 and a daughter on 5  January  2015,  and  she  feared  return  for
    herself and her children.  She stated that she had  subsequently  split
    up with her partner.

 3. The Appellant appealed against the decision.  Her  appeal  came  before
    Judge M A Khan for hearing on 26  October  2018.   In  a  decision  and
    reasons promulgated on 9 November 2018, the judge dismissed the appeal,
    finding that the Appellant's evidence was not credible or consistent.

 4. Permission to appeal was sought in time on the basis that the judge had
    materially erred:

      1) in entirely overlooking the content of the expert report of Antonia
         Young and thus failed to consider credibility in the round and that
         he had essentially rejected the expert report on the basis  of  his
         previous negative  credibility  finding,  which  was  an  erroneous
         approach;

      2) in  failing  to  address  at  all  the  issues  of  sufficiency  of
         protection and internal relocation;

      3) in failing entirely to  consider  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  of  the
         Rules and whether there would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to
         integration, given that both children were born in the UK and  have
         never been to Albania and the fact the children  were  illegitimate
         in light of the evidence that this was a sort of stigmatisation and
         a risk was clearly material.

 5. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Andrew in
    the following terms on 5 December 2018:

         "I am satisfied there are arguable errors of law in the decision in
         that the judge did not consider the expert report in the round when
         making his  credibility  findings.   Further,  the  judge  did  not
         address the  issues  of  sufficiency  of  protection  and  internal
         flight.  Further, he failed to consider paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)  of
         the Rules".

 6. The Respondent submitted a Rule 24 response dated 2 January 2019  which
    provides:

         "The Respondent submits the grounds of appeal are  a  disagreement.
         It was  the  role  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  consider  the
         Appellant's credibility and not that of the expert.  This Appellant
         was not a claimed victim of trafficking, she had come to the UK  to
         join her then partner.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  gave  clear  and
         cogent reasons for not accepting the Appellant's account of  events
         in Albania and subsequently".





     Hearing

 7. Mr Hawkin, on behalf of the Appellant, sought to rely on the grounds of
    appeal.   He  submitted  the  judge  had   rejected   the   Appellant's
    credibility without considering the expert evidence and this was  clear
    from [45] where the judge held as follows:

         "The Appellant has provided an  expert  report  by  Antonia  Young.
         There is no issue with regard to  the  expert's  evidence  and  her
         qualifications, however  this  report  has  been  prepared  on  the
         information provided by  the  Appellant.   Her  evidence  seriously
         damages the Appellant's credibility and that of her claim.  In  the
         circumstances  I  find  that  the  expert  report  is  of   limited
         assistance to the Tribunal in this matter".

 8. Mr Hawkin drew attention to the specific findings by the expert  as  to
    the plausibility of the Appellant's  individual  account  at  [7.2]  to
    [7.4], pages 35 to 36, and page 41 at [8.2.]  He stated that the report
    is set out  in  the  Respondent's  bundle  and  section  7  at  B18  is
    specifically relevant.

 9. Whilst the judge did not accept  the  credibility  of  the  Appellant's
    claim in respect of the evidence about her cousin and contact with  him
    in the United Kingdom, even if the judge was  correct  that  there  was
    inconsistency in the Appellant's account, Mr Hawkin submitted this  did
    not go to the heart of the case.  As  the  Appellant  set  out  in  her
    interview, she had been locked in the family home for ten days,  beaten
    with a wet rope and after agreeing to the marriage with  her  ex-fianc�
    and having escaped, she was told when she contacted her mother that  if
    she returned her head would be cut off.  He submitted that this  was  a
    very serious set of facts.

10. Mr Hawkin further submitted the judge had failed to  give  reasons  for
    rejecting the Appellant's account of having split up from her  partner,
    finding at [37]:

         "The Appellant's daughter was born on 5  January  2015,  they  both
         went to register her birth together, although in the interview, she
         stated that she called him to attend the registrar I find that they
         were and are still living in a relationship.  Mr N  himself  has  a
         long undesirable immigration history going  back  to  2001,  having
         claimed asylum, which was refused, in 2009 deported back to Albania
         after a criminal conviction but found his way back to the  UK.   He
         is still  in  this  country,  lurking  in  the  background  of  the
         Appellant's life and her claim.  I  do  not  find  the  Appellant's
         evidence that Mr N did not  tell  her  anything  about  his  status
         during the time they spent together as credible or consistent".

    Mr Hawkin submitted there was no evidential basis for finding  "he  was
    lurking in the background" and this was pure  speculation.   The  judge
    had, he submitted, failed to give  any  or  adequate  reasons  for  his
    findings in this respect.

11. Mr Hawkin further  submitted  that  the  judge  had  wholly  failed  to
    consider paragraph 276ADE(vi) of the Rules and this was  a  fundamental
    error of law given that any Article 8 consideration must begin with the
    Rules.

12. Submissions were made about the Appellant's two children  and  herself,
    and in particular the position of illegitimate children in Albania.  As
    is set out in the grounds of appeal, it is apparent that the judge  did
    not make findings on sufficiency of protection or  internal  relocation
    on the basis that he had rejected the credibility  of  the  Appellant's
    account.  However, that was not sufficient.

13. In her submissions, Ms Pal  submitted  that  the  judge  properly  made
    findings of fact.  At [37] he gave reasons  as  to  why  he  found  the
    Appellant and her partner were still together, because they  both  went
    to register their daughter's birth.  The judge also found the Appellant
    was not credible in terms of her fear of her family and  her  ex-fianc�
    at [39] and [42] which provide as follows:

         "39. The Appellant states that her family will be able to find  her
             anywhere in Albania as it is a small country and  her  brother
             is a taxi driver.  As I do not accept  the  Appellant's  claim
             that she is in fear of her family or her ex-fianc�, I  do  not
             accept that she cannot live in Albania ...

         42.  I do not accept the Appellant's evidence that she fled Albania
             in fear of her life from her family and the ex-fianc�.   I  do
             not accept her evidence that she was locked up by  her  family
             after she told them of her relationship with  Mr  N.   I  find
             that the Appellant has made up whole of her  story  about  the
             fear of her family and her ex-fianc� in order  to  secure  her
             claim in this country".

14. Ms Pal submitted  that  the  judge  had  to  consider  the  Appellant's
    credibility  and  make  findings  in  respect  of  the  evidence.   She
    submitted it was not the role of  the  expert  to  assess  whether  the
    Appellant was credible or not.   The  judge  had  properly  taken  into
    account  the  report  of  Antonia  Young  but  nevertheless  found  the
    Appellant was not credible in respect of her claim and that she did not
    qualify for asylum.  Having found the Appellant not to be credible, the
    judge was not then required to go on to make findings as to sufficiency
    of protection and internal relocation.

15. Ms Pal submitted that the  judge  had,  from  [49]  onwards  considered
    Article 8 and had considered  the  children's  private  life  at  [55],
    finding that this could continue with their mother in Albania and  that
    they were not qualifying children.  She submitted there was no material
    error of law in the judge's assessment of the facts and conclusions  in
    respect of both asylum and Article 8.

16. In reply, Mr Hawkin submitted that whilst the judge may have looked  at
    Article 8, he did not consider paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) as to whether or
    not there will be significant obstacles  to  integration.   This  is  a
    different test to whether or not the children have lived in the UK  for
    seven years and it was incumbent upon the judge to do that, whether  or
    not the judge found the Appellant to be credible.  This is  essentially
    a freestanding point.

17. Mr Hawkin accepted the judge had made adverse credibility findings  but
    submitted that he had done this as a result of an incorrect approach in
    failing to assess credibility  in  light  of  the  expert  and  country
    evidence.  The judge had further failed  to  give  reasons  or  explain
    himself clearly at all and that overall given the serious nature of the
    Appellant's account and the fact it was an asylum appeal it can clearly
    be said there was a lack of anxious scrutiny.

     Findings and Reasons

18. I find material errors of law in the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge M A Khan.  Firstly, in relation to the assessment of credibility,
    I find that ground 1 of the grounds of appeal  has  merit.   The  judge
    addressed the issue of the  expert's  report  at  [45].   However,  his
    reasoning for failing to consider the Appellant's credibility in  light
    of that report is entirely unclear.  At [45] (op  cit)  he  found  "Her
    evidence seriously damages the Appellant's credibility and that of  her
    claim".  It is unclear whether when referring to  "her"  the  judge  is
    referring to the expert, Ms Antonia Young, or the Appellant herself and
    why this is, absent any particularisation.  I  further  find  that  the
    judge erroneously failed to conduct his credibility assessment in light
    of the evidence set out in the expert report, cf  Mibanga  [2005]  EWCA
    367 and that he failed to give proper or adequate reasons  for  finding
    that the report was only of "limited assistance" to  the  Tribunal,  so
    that it was possible to  ascertain  which  aspects  of  the  report  he
    accepted, which he rejected and the reasons for that.

19. Further, whilst having found the Appellant not to be credible the judge
    clearly did not consider it was necessary to engage with the issues  of
    sufficiency of protection or internal relocation, he does not, in fact,
    state that in his decision.  Given that these  were  issues  that  were
    clearly raised in the Appellant's claim, in the refusal letter  and  in
    the skeleton argument before him, I consider it was incumbent upon  him
    to at least address those points.  All the judge said at [39] was:

         "The Appellant states that her family will  be  able  to  find  her
         anywhere in Albania as it is a small country and her brother  is  a
         taxi driver.  As I do not accept the Appellant's claim that she  is
         in fear of her family or her ex-fianc�, I do not  accept  that  she
         cannot live in Albania".

    I find that this does not deal with the issue  of  internal  relocation
    properly or at all.

20. Lastly, there was no consideration by the judge of paragraph 276ADE(vi)
    of the Rules.  It is necessary in light of the jurisprudence  from  the
    higher courts to consider any Article 8 claim through the prism of  the
    Immigration  Rules.   That  the  judge  has  failed  to   do,   despite
    submissions being expressly  made  both  orally  and  in  the  skeleton
    argument as to whether there would be  very  significant  obstacles  to
    integration both by the Appellant and her  two  illegitimate  children.
    In that respect there is no finding by the judge as to the legal status
    of the children.  The Appellant's consistent claim  is  that  they  are
    illegitimate.  The judge notes that submission at  [30]  but  makes  no
    finding upon it.

21. I further  find  that  the  judge's  findings  as  to  the  Appellant's
    relationship with  her  former  partner  N  at  [37]  are  unclear  and
    unsustainable.  There is no evidential basis to find that the Appellant
    remains with her former partner and father of her children.   The  fact
    that he attended the registrar to register the birth of the children is
    not,  I  find,  sufficient  reason  to  find  that  they  remain  in  a
    relationship,  absent  any  other  evidential  foundation  for  such  a
    finding.

     Decision

22. In light of the above findings and reasons, I find material  errors  of
    law in the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge M A Khan.  I set  that
    decision aside and remit the appeal for a hearing de novo.  Whilst  the
    appeal was previously heard in Harmondsworth, the Appellant  is  living
    in E11, thus it would be more appropriate for the appeal to be heard in
    Taylor House.

     Directions

 1) The appeal should be listed for two and a half hours.

 2) An Albanian interpreter will be required.

 3) The file should be transferred from the Hatton Cross Hearing Centre  to
    Taylor House.

 4)  Listing  should  please  liaise  with  the  clerk  to  Mr  Hawkin   on
    02074528900.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
