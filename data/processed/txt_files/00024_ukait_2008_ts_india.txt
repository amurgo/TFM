A working holidaymaker must show that he has sufficient resources of his
own (including those derived from work as allowed by the scheme) to
maintain and accommodate himself during his stay. The requirement in para
95(v) is not met by the provision, or promised provision, of support by
third parties.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of India who appealed against a decision  by
    the respondent of 6 February 2007 to refuse his application  for  leave
    to enter the United Kingdom as a working holidaymaker for a  period  of
    two years, pursuant to para 95 of the Immigration Rules.  The  material
    part of the grounds of the refusal was as follows:


      "Although I accept that your age makes you eligible  to  apply  for  a
        working holiday visa, you must also show me that you will leave the
        United Kingdom at the end of your working holiday and that you will
        not take up permanent work. You indicate that you completed a hotel
        management course in September 2006  and  that  you  are  presently
        awaiting results. You explain  that  you  have  been  helping  your
        father on his family farm since then. You have  failed  to  provide
        any credible explanation as to why you now seek to go on a  holiday
        for two years. This is particularly relevant, as you have also  not
        explained; how you will spend your leisure time in the UK;  or  how
        you will support yourself when the money you plan to take with  you
        has run out. Because of these things, I am not satisfied  that  you
        plan to leave the UK at the end of your working holiday or that you
        plan to only do temporary work.

      To go on a working holiday to the UK, you  must  be  able  to  support
        yourself without taking up full time work for the main part of your
        time in the UK, or using public funds. You indicate that  a  cousin
        in the UK will fund your entire two year stay. You  have  not  been
        able to provide any indication as to how much this will cost or any
        credible explanation as to why your cousin is to fund  your  entire
        stay for two years when he has a family  of  four  to  support,  or
        provide any details of his financial commitment. Furthermore I note
        that your family circumstances  in  India  are  modest,  that  your
        father farms 7 acres land and supports a family of four.  You  have
        not explained or show that it is realistic for you  to  spend  your
        sponsor's savings on a working holiday. Because of this , I am  not
        satisfied that you want to enter the UK for a  working  holiday  as
        you have claimed, or that you plan to leave the UK at  the  end  of
        your stay.

      The Lonely Planet Guide 2006 for the  UK  says  that  people  visiting
        London will need at least �40 a day for the cheapest accommodation,
        travel and  food.  It  goes  on  to  say  that  even  fairly  cheap
        sightseeing or nightlife  can  easily  add  another  �20  to  this.
        Outside London, you will still need at least �30 a day if you  have
        your own transport (which you say you do not)  and  cook  your  own
        meals. However the Guide says that if you stay in bed and breakfast
        accommodation eat one sit down meal a day and do not  try  to  save
        money on entry fees you will need about �60 a  day.  You  have  not
        provided any credible explanation as to how you  will  be  able  to
        support yourself without taking up full time work or  using  public
        funds.

      When I asked you what you plan to do after your working holiday  ends,
        you did not give a clear explanation  of  your  plans.  Although  I
        accept that you may not have firm plans for the  future,  you  must
        show that you plan to leave the UK  at  the  end  of  your  working
        holiday. Because you have not shown me any realistic future  plans,
        I am not satisfied that you plan to leave the UK at the end of your
        stay.

2.    The appeal was heard by Immigration Judge T Jones  on  25  June  2007.
    The  appeal  was  dismissed  because  the  Immigration  Judge  was  not
    satisfied that at the date of the respondent's decision (a) pursuant to
    paragraph 95(iv) of the Statement of Changes in Immigration  Rules,  HC
    395 the appellant had the  means  to  pay  for  his  return  or  onward
    journey, or, (b) pursuant to paragraph 95(v) the appellant was able and
    intended to maintain and accommodate himself without recourse to public
    funds.

3.     On  7  August  2007  Senior  Immigration   Judge   Chalkley   ordered
    reconsideration on the basis that it was arguable Immigration  Judge  T
    Jones should not have considered himself bound to apply AM (Third Party
    support not permitted Rule 281(v)) Ethiopia [2007] UKIAT  58  and  thus
    dismiss the appeal, because the appellant was  unable  to  finance  his
    proposed visit from his own financial resources.

4.    The factual background to the substantive application is  not  unusual
    because of the common characteristics that will be shared by those  who
    meet the requirements of paragraph 95(ii) and 95(iii), which limit  the
    pool of applicants to those in the specific age range of 17-30, and  to
    those who are neither married, nor in a civil partnership, or, who  are
    intending to take  their  working  holiday  with  their  partner.  This
    appellant is a young single man who says  that  he  has  completed  his
    education, but has not yet either established a career, or acquired any
    significant assets, and has  as  yet  no  dependants.  He  declared  an
    intention to visit the United Kingdom to take an extended holiday,  and
    during the course of that  visit  to  take  employment  that  would  be
    incidental to that holiday.  He said that in the course of his visit he
    would  stay  with  members  of  his  extended  family,  who   are   all
    legitimately resident in the United Kingdom.

 5. Indeed the only unusual feature of the evidence in  this  case  is  the
    wealth  of  the  appellant's  cousin.  Evidence  was  produced  to  the
    Immigration Judge to show that the cousin had a salary in the financial
    year ending 5 April 2007 of �158,229, and had at the date  of  decision
    savings in the form of ISAs, Unit Trusts, and PEPs  amounting  to  some
    �150,000 in total. This financial  evidence  was  not  the  subject  of
    challenge before the Immigration  Judge,  and  the  respondent  made  a
    relevant concession in the course of the hearing that was  recorded  at
    paragraph 3 of the determination as follows:

      "[the Respondent] made it clear that there was  no  issue  as  to  the
        Sponsor's capacity to maintain and accommodate  the  appellant,  or
        assist the  appellant  with  the  cost  of  his  return  or  onward
        journey".

 6. The reasons for the  Immigration  Judge's  decision  were  set  out  at
    paragraphs 10 - 12 of the determination as follows;


        "10. On the totality of the evidence I find that the appellant  has
             not discharged the relevant burden and standard of proof placed
             upon him in the proceedings. I find for the respondent.


      11.   I make such finding because against the appropriate standard,  I
             find that I am bound by AM and I note  the  reference  made  to
             paragraph  22  of  AM  in  relation  to  the  appellant   being
             responsible for the costs of his own maintenance;  Mr  Addy  in
             his skeleton argument rightly points to  many  working  holiday
             makers not having sponsors in any event. I have evidence before
             me of a job offer; which  I  accept  is  genuine;  but  if  the
             appellant were to work  5  days  every  week  as  suggested  in
             submissions, this surely raises the issue  as  to  whether  the
             appellant is intending only to take employment incidental to  a
             holiday. I find that the appellant therein, as  was  submitted,
             falls foul of paragraph 95(vi).

      12.   In relation to the costs of the return or onward journey;  again
             there is little evidence, as  to  what  if  any  of  the  joint
             savings the appellant has are available to him in  real  terms.
             The wording of paragraph 95 I find is such that  the  appellant
             must show he has the means to pay for the  same;  I  uphold  Mr
             Addy's submission  therein.  I  find  against  the  appropriate
             standard, there is no evidence that the appellant has the means
             to pay the costs of the ticket required. I  do  not  doubt  the
             Sponsor would advance him the costs of the same even as a  loan
             that might never be called for repayment, if needs be but there
             was no evidence of this before me. The submissions  were  based
             on the appellant's own savings as  put  in  the  interview  and
             there was no evidence before me as to what the costs  of  those
             tickets might be. Equally, there is no evidence before me as to
             whether the appellant could apply any of  the  savings  to  his
             maintenance whilst establishing himself with  some  funds  from
             work in the United Kingdom, or apply the savings combined  with
             earnings to achieve the work/leisure balance of the  rule.  The
             whole basis of his application, and  appeal  prepared  for  the
             hearing, was that the appellant would be sponsored. I am merely
             left with submissions, largely unsupported by evidence, to deal
             with the respondent's position; perhaps the position  may  have
             been recovered if an adjournment had  been  sought,  or  a  new
             application submitted. I was not without some sympathy for  the
             appellant's representative in all the circumstances. "


7.    The appellant's application  for  reconsideration  relied  upon  three
    grounds.  Firstly it is argued that the Immigration Judge erred in  law
    in considering himself bound by the decision of the Tribunal in AM  and
    then as a result in going on to apply that decision to  an  application
    that was not made for the purpose of settlement but for the purpose  of
    temporary admission.  Secondly it is argued that the finding  that  the
    Claimant did not have the means to pay for his onward or return journey
    was unsupported by  the  evidence.   Thirdly  it  is  argued  that  the
    Immigration Judge was obliged to  accept  the  Claimant's  unchallenged
    evidence to the effect that he only intended to  take  jobs  for  short
    periods in order to further his English skills, and that these would be
    incidental to the holiday. Consequently it is  argued  the  Immigration
    Judge had no basis upon which to call into question the nature  of  the
    Claimant's declared intentions in the light of the evidence of an offer
    of six months employment as a clerk for five hours a day, for five days
    a week.

8.    The first ground turns  upon  the  proper  construction  of  paragraph
    95(v) of the Immigration Rules. We note the terms  of  paragraph  95(v)
    and we contrast the terms of what is required of a prospective  visitor
    for a period of up to six months, pursuant to  paragraph  41(vi),  with
    what is required of a prospective working holidaymaker visiting  for  a
    period of up to twenty four months,  in  relation  to  maintenance  and
    accommodation:


       41(vi)      ...  will  maintain  and  accommodate  himself  and  any
               dependents adequately out  of  resources  available  to  him
               without recourse to public funds or  taking  employment;  or
               will, with any dependents, be  maintained  and  accommodated
               adequately by relatives or friends


      95(v) ... is able and intends  to  maintain  and  accommodate  himself
               without recourse to public funds.

 9. We note the draftsman's express distinction between these  two  classes
    of visitor. There is no reason to suppose that this distinction is  the
    result of a slip, or drafting  error.  In  our  judgement  the  working
    holidaymaker cannot simply be equated  with  the  short  term  visitor,
    because it is plain that they are quite different classes  of  visitor.
    The working holidaymaker is permitted entry for an extended period, and
    granted permission to take employment (within the  constraints  of  the
    Immigration Rules). The short term visitor, in sharp contrast, is  not.
    Moreover the distinction to be drawn between the two classes of visitor
    in relation to employment is not limited to the grant of permission  to
    take employment, but extends to their intentions towards employment.  A
    short  term  visitor  who  intends  to  work  will  not   satisfy   the
    requirements of para 41; a working holidaymaker who does not intend  to
    take work will not meet the requirements of para 95  (see  NS  (Working
    holidaymaker; intention to work) India [2007]  UKAIT  0090).   The  two
    classes of visitor are therefore mutually exclusive.

10.  The requirements for students and the reasons  for  those  requirements
    are different too.  In para 57(vii) of the Immigration Rules  the  term
    "himself" does not appear as a qualification. Thus the requirement  for
    a prospective student is that he "is able to  meet  the  costs  of  his
    course and  accommodation  and  the  maintenance  of  himself  and  any
    dependents without taking employment or engaging in business or  having
    recourse  to  public  funds."  That  distinction  too   is   no   doubt
    intentional.   Prospective  students  intend  to  benefit  and  improve
    themselves through education, and  upon  return  to  their  country  of
    origin they can be expected to take with them valuable  skills  to  the
    benefit of their  community  in  addition  to  themselves.  It  may  be
    unrealistic to have a universal expectation that a student, who may not
    even be an adult, be able himself, from his own resources, to meet  all
    his  costs.   Moreover  the  prospective  student's  ability  to   take
    employment is heavily circumscribed.  No doubt that is to  ensure  that
    the  applicant's  ability  to  study  does  not  become   a   secondary
    consideration to the need to find  and  keep  employment  in  order  to
    ensure that the funds needed for maintenance and accommodation  can  be
    raised.

11.   The situation of the prospective working  holidaymaker  is  distinctly
    different  because  of  the  different  purpose   expressed   for   the
    prospective visit, namely to enjoy an extended holiday  in  the  United
    Kingdom for up to two years. In such a  case  an  applicant  will  have
    declared an intention either to defer  the  commencement  of  a  career
    embarked upon in the country of origin, or even  to  interrupt  it,  in
    order to take a lengthy holiday  in  the  United  Kingdom.  It  is  not
    unreasonable for the Immigration Rules to be framed in such a way as to
    seek to ensure that a working holidaymaker will be self sufficient,  so
    that he can avoid becoming a burden on the state, or having to  abandon
    the concept of employment taken only as incidental to the  holiday,  in
    favour of full time employment that is necessary for survival.

12.  We  note  that  the  terms  of  paragraph  95(v)  do  not  carry   the
    qualification  of  adequacy  in  respect   of   the   maintenance   and
    accommodation an applicant is  required  to  be  able  to  provide  for
    himself. This too  reflects  the  different  circumstances  of  working
    holidaymakers from some other entrants to the  UK.   The  accommodation
    that the stereotypical working  holidaymaker  (or  'backpacker')  might
    consider acceptable, by way of a bed in a multi-occupant hostel, is not
    that which would be suitable for permanent settlement. Nor would it  be
    suitable accommodation for occupation by a child.  We note that each of
    the provisions in the Immigration Rules relating  to  children  carries
    the qualification of adequacy; including the requirements that  are  to
    be found in paragraph 101 of the Immigration Rules to be  satisfied  in
    the event of entry clearance for the child of a  working  holidaymaker.
    There are sound policy reasons for that.  Further, the imposition of  a
    test that maintenance and accommodation be  'adequate'  is  undoubtedly
    appropriate in the context of an application for permanent  settlement,
    as indeed the Immigration Rules also repeatedly reflect.

13.   It is perhaps also worth making reference to  the  Rules  relating  to
    'au pairs' at paras 88ff of HC 395.  Here there is again a  requirement
    that the applicant be able to maintain and accommodate himself  without
    recourse to public funds.  It is the essence of  the  scheme,  however,
    that the applicant's maintenance and accommodation will be provided  by
    the family where the 'au pair' is placed.  But it is also true that the
    maintenance and accommodation are part of an agreement and are provided
    in return for help in the home.  So it is right again to see  that  the
    maintenance and accommodation are  derived  from  the  applicant's  own
    resources, that is, the ability to receive them as part  of  a  bargain
    for work that is being done  under  a  specific  type  of  arrangement.
    Similarly, the rules relating to admission for settlement must  assume,
    where parties  are  required  to  show  that  they  will  maintain  and
    accommodate themselves, that they will be able to do so by working.

14.   As is said in AM at [22], mere silence in the Immigration Rules as  to
    whether third party support is permissible cannot be taken to mean that
    it is. Had it been intended that third party support should  satisfy  a
    maintenance requirement it could be expected that the Immigration Rules
    would say so.  That view has now been endorsed by the Court  of  Appeal
    in MW (Liberia) v SSHD [2007] EWCA Civ 1376.

15.   We are satisfied that the express terms of paragraph 95(v) require  an
    applicant to demonstrate at the very  least  the  ability  to  be  self
    sufficient, throughout the duration of the proposed visit.  We conclude
    that an applicant will not make out the necessary requirements if he is
    constrained through his financial  circumstances  to  rely,  either  in
    whole or in part, upon promises of financial support, whether  to  meet
    his maintenance, or his accommodation needs, and, whether they be  made
    to him by family, or friends, or whether they be promises of money,  or
    money's worth.   He has to be able to show that he has sufficient  from
    his own resources (including the ability to do a limited amount of work
    merely incidental to a holiday) to fund the trip.

16.   In that context we remind  ourselves  that  the  working  holidaymaker
    provisions are not a route to ordinary or  regular  employment  in  the
    United Kingdom, and thus as the means  to  amass  the  capital  to  set
    oneself up for life.  It must be borne firmly in  mind  that  whilst  a
    successful working holidaymaker is permitted to take  employment,  that
    employment must be incidental to the holiday (AG (Working holidaymaker;
    "incidental") India [2007] UKAIT 00033), and in any  event  the  period
    for which the applicant proposes to take employment must be  a  maximum
    of twelve months (paragraph 95(vi)).  The  phrase  'incidental  to  the
    holiday' has two elements: the working must be merely  incidental,  and
    it must be incidental to the holiday, not to something else.

17.   We should reiterate by way of a cautionary note what was  said  in  AA
    and Others (Sectors Based Work; general principles)  Bangladesh  [2006]
    UKAIT 26:

      '32   ..it is quite wrong for an Entry Clearance  Officer  to  assume,
           from the fact that  the  scheme  will  offer  the  applicant  an
           opportunity, during the year that he is lawfully employed  under
           it, to make what may by his standards be a  considerable  amount
           of money, that  the  applicant  will  thereafter  seek  to  work
           unlawfully. That is equivalent to an assumption that anyone  who
           has the opportunity to commit an offence will do so. Nor  should
           Entry Clearance Officers confuse actual intention with  apparent
           motive. The fact that an  applicant  has  no  apparent  economic
           reason to return to his own country does not mean that he has no
           intention of returning to his own country  at  the  end  of  his
           employment.
            ...

      34     It  follows  also  that  entry  clearance  applications  cannot
           properly be refused  on  the  basis  of  generalities  that  may
           originate from a disapproval of the scheme and  a  suspicion  of
           abuse. Each applicant is entitled to individual consideration of
           his own individual circumstances and individual  intentions.  If
           the application is  refused,  the  notice  of  refusal  and  the
           explanatory statement must show that the refusal was  based  not
           merely on a generalised suspicion but on a proper evaluation  of
           the appellant's evidence.'

18    There must therefore be an individual consideration of an  applicant's
    circumstances and intentions. The burden of proof is on the  applicant,
    and because of the strict requirements of paragraph 95 it may  be  that
    he will not find it an easy one to discharge, even though he need do so
    only on the balance  of  probabilities.  It  may  well  be  that  Entry
    Clearance Officers will feel the need to make more use of interviews to
    test declarations of intention by applicants. Certainly we would expect
    a successful applicant to be able to give a  credible  reason  for  his
    decision to take an extended holiday, and if that reason be in part  an
    intention to develop skills, to then  be  able  both  to  identify  the
    skills in question, how they might expect to be developed, and  explain
    how he proposed to put those enhanced skills to future use.  So far  as
    finances are concerned, he will need to show  that  he  will  be  able,
    within the employment restrictions imposed by the Rules,  to  be  self-
    sufficient.

19.   It was argued in the application for reconsideration, although not  by
    Ms Plimmer, that a construction of paragraph  95,  in  its  requirement
    that a person be able and intend be self sufficient, could result in  a
    disproportionate breach of an applicant's Article 8 rights. We  do  not
    agree. There is adequate provision under the Immigration Rules  for  an
    individual's application to enter the United Kingdom for a short  visit
    by way of paragraph 41, and pursuant to that provision the  maintenance
    and accommodation requirements of the applicant can be met by  a  third
    party sponsor. We are not persuaded that  denying  an  applicant  under
    paragraph 41 the ability to take employment, or conversely requiring an
    applicant under paragraph 95 to  have  both  the  ability  to  be  self
    sufficient, and, to hold a genuine intention  to  be  self  sufficient,
    results in any breach of their Article 8 rights.

20.   In the circumstances it is difficult to see how the Immigration  judge
    could have come to any other conclusion than that which  ultimately  he
    did reach.

21.   The appellant had declared an intention to  pay  for  his  return  air
    fare himself, using his own resources to do so.  He  had  not  produced
    evidence to the Immigration Judge, (and did not produce  such  evidence
    to us either) to show the likely cost of  a  return  air  fare.  It  is
    however in our judgement unlikely  that  the  entirety  of  the  credit
    balance in the joint savings account (the equivalent of �555) would  be
    sufficient to cover that cost. Even if it were, it is self evident that
    the cost would exhaust those funds.

22.   The appellant was not, on the evidence  that  he  presented,  able  to
    accommodate and maintain himself  for  the  duration  of  the  proposed
    visit, even from a  combination  of  his  existing  resources  and  the
    additional funds that he expected to earn during a  twelve  month  part
    time employment. We note that the appellant's case was that he had  the
    necessary resources only because he  had  recourse  to  the  funds  and
    accommodation  that  were  to  be  provided  to  him  by  his   cousin.
    Accordingly the appellant had declared no intention to try to  be  self
    sufficient, but in contrast had declared an intention to live with  his
    cousin during the proposed visit, and to accept his financial  support.
    The appellant did not therefore  at  the  date  of  decision  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 95.

23.   The Immigration Judge made no material error, and we  order  that  his
    determination dismissing this appeal shall stand.
