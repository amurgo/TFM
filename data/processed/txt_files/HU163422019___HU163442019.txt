For the Appellants:    Mr Broachwalla, Counsel instructed by F R Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1.  This  has  been  a  remote  hearing  to  which   both   parties   have
    consented. The form of remote hearing was video  by  Microsoft  Teams
    (V). A face to face hearing was not held because it was not practicable
    and all issues could be determined in  a  remote  hearing.  I  did  not
    experience any difficulties, and neither party expressed  any  concern,
    with the process.

 2. The appellants are appealing against the decision of Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Sullivan ("the judge") promulgated on  20  November  2020
    dismissing their human rights appeal.

 3. The hearing was listed for,  and  took  place  on,  11  November  2020.
    Neither the appellants nor a representative on their  behalf  attended.
    The judge was satisfied that the notice of hearing  had  been  properly
    served and decided to  hear  the  appeal  in  the  appellants'  absence
    pursuant to rule 28 of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier  Tribunal)
    (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014.

 4. The appellants claim that the only reason for their non-attendance  was
    that they were not aware of the  hearing.  Both  appellants  and  their
    solicitor have filed witness  statements  stating  that  they  did  not
    receive notice of the hearing.

 5. Ms Everett expressed the view that if I accepted the  evidence  of  the
    appellants and their solicitor it would be procedurally unfair for  the
    decision to stand.

 6. I have no reason to doubt the veracity  of  the  witness  evidence.  In
    particular, I note that  one  of  the  witness  statements  is  from  a
    solicitor and any dishonesty on his part would constitute very  serious
    professional misconduct.

 7. Although the judge cannot be faulted for proceeding  with  the  hearing
    given the information that was available when the appeal was  heard  on
    11 November 2020, the  decision  nonetheless  must  be  set  aside  for
    procedural unfairness as the appellants, through no fault of their own,
    were unable to present their case at the hearing.

 8. I make the observation that it might have been preferable had the First-
    tier Tribunal considered whether to set the decision aside pursuant  to
    rule 32 of the Tribunal Procedure  (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration
    and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014. See  TPN  (FtT  appeals  -  withdrawal)
    Vietnam [2017] UKUT 00295 (IAC).



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside  and  remitted  to  the
First-tier Tribunal to be made afresh by a different judge.
