                            DECISION AND REASONS



The Respondents

 1. The Respondents to whom I shall refer as "the Applicants"  are  husband
    and wife and their two children born in 1999 and 2001.   They  are  all
    citizens of Bangladesh.

 2. On 11 April the Applicants entered with leave until 20  September  2005
    as family visitors.  They overstayed and on 16  December  2009  applied
    for  indefinite  leave.   The  Appellant  (the  SSHD)   refused   those
    applications.  The Applicants took no further  action  until  26  March
    2013 when they made further applications for limited leave  to  remain.
    On 13 October  2014  the  SSHD  refused  the  applications  by  way  of
    reference to paragraph 276ADE and Appendix  FM,  Section  EX.1  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The  SSHD  took  into  account  the  obligation  to
    consider the best interests of the child Applicants imposed by  Section
    55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.   Additionally
    reference was made to paragraph 353B of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    SSHD stated there were no  circumstances  which  warranted  a  separate
    consideration of the applications by way of reference to Article  8  of
    the European Convention outside the Immigration Rules.

 3. On 28 October 2014 each of the Applicants lodged notice of appeal under
    Section 82 of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  as
    amended  (the  2002  Act).   The  grounds  refer  to   the   subsisting
    relationship between the parents and their children and the  fact  they
    have lived in the United Kingdom continuously for almost ten years  and
    assert it would be unreasonable to expect them to return to Bangladesh,
    particularly the children.  The other grounds are generic.

The First-tier Tribunal Proceedings

 4. Following a hearing at which the parents gave oral testimony as well as
    the wife's  brother  and  sister,  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Wellesley-Cole allowed the appeals in a decision  promulgated  on  12th
    May 2015.

 5. The Respondent sought permission to appeal which on 31 July 2015  Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal Pirotta granted because it was arguable  the
    Judge had erred in considering the child Applicants in isolation before
    considering the appeals of their parents and had not taken  a  holistic
    approach or applied the jurisprudence in EV (Philippines) v SSHD [2014]
    EWCA Civ. 874.  Additionally, her  treatment  of  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules and the  claim  under  Article  8  was  questionable.
    Further, the Judge had failed to  take  into  account  the  Applicants'
    immigration history which included the use of false documents to obtain
    education for the child  Applicants.   The  Judge's  consideration  was
    "short on facts, evidence, analysis or findings".  It was also arguable
    the Judge "had not properly conducted the evaluation of  the  evidence,
    arguments or law, applied case law or carried out the  proper  exercise
    of Appendix FM (and paragraph) 276ADE".



The Upper Tribunal Proceedings

 6. For the Applicants, Mr Reza stated he had seen neither the  application
    for nor the grant of permission to appeal.  Copies were made  available
    and time given for him to consider them.

Submissions for the SSHD

 7.  Ms  Willocks-Briscoe  relied  in  the  grounds   in   the   permission
    application.  She referred to paragraph 18 of the decision allowing the
    appeals of the child Applicants by way of reference to Section EX.1  of
    Appendix FM.  She submitted that Section EX.1  was  not  applicable  to
    either the adult Applicants or their children for the reasons given  at
    pages 2 and 3 of the SSHD's decision.  The  adult  Applicants  did  not
    satisfy the requirements of paragraph E-LTRP.1.2 because they were  not
    British citizens or present and settled in the United Kingdom or in the
    United Kingdom with refugee  leave  or  as  persons  with  humanitarian
    protection.  Section EX.1 was not applicable to  the  child  Applicants
    because neither  parent  satisfied  the  requirement  of  paragraph  E-
    LRTC.1.6 of having leave to enter or remain.  She also  relied  on  the
    determination in Sabir (Appendix FM-EX.1 not freestanding) [2014]  UKUT
    00063 (IAC) that Section EX.1 is  not  a  freestanding  element  but  a
    component part of any relevant leave granting Rule.

 8. The Judge had failed to view the evidence holistically and  to  address
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules and  Appendix  FM.   Further,
    her treatment of the claim under Article 8 of the  European  Convention
    outside the Rules  was  deficient  because  it  had  proceeded  on  the
    artificial basis that the  child  Applicants  remained  in  the  United
    Kingdom following their parents' departure.

Submissions for the Applicants

 9. Mr Reza whose firm had been instructed as recently as 21 October  2015,
    submitted that there was no  material  error  of  law  in  the  Judge's
    decision.  She had  adopted  a  structured  approach  and  referred  to
    relevant case law.  He continued that the child Applicants had been  in
    the United Kingdom for a long time and the  Judge's  treatment  of  the
    claim outside the Immigration Rules in the latter part of paragraph  18
    of her decision  was  proper  and  gave  sustainable  reasons  for  her
    conclusion.

10. The child Applicants met the requirements of paragraph  276ADE  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  He referred generally to the case law dealing  with
    child appellants to which the Judge had referred at paragraphs  16  and
    17 of her decision.  Both child Applicants  had  lived  in  the  United
    Kingdom for more than seven years and he referred  generically  to  the
    determination in Azimi-Moayed and others (Decisions affecting children;
    onward appeals) Iran [2013] UKUT 197 (IAC).

11. He  then  submitted  that  if  the  child  Applicants  qualified  under
    paragraph 276ADE then their parents should succeed under Article  8  of
    the European Convention outside  the  Immigration  Rules.   No  further
    authority or argument was submitted to support this proposition.

12. Mr Reza turned to the use of false passports by the adult Applicants to
    obtain State education for the child  Applicants.   They  had  admitted
    this in their applications for further leave.  It had not been referred
    to by the SSHD in the decision and therefore there had been no need for
    the Judge to have considered this aspect.

13. There were compelling reasons to grant leave  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules.

14. The Judge had found the  child  Applicants  qualified  under  paragraph
    276ADE and had then gone  on  to  consider  the  claims  of  the  adult
    Applicants and allowed them outside the Immigration  Rules.   They  had
    admitted at an early stage  their  use  of  false  documentation  which
    should not thereafter be held against them.  The decision contained  no
    material error of law and should stand.

Further Submissions for the SSHD

15. Ms Willocks-Briscoe submitted that the provisions of  paragraph  276ADE
    of the Immigration Rules were not available for the free-standing grant
    of leave to children.  The Judge had failed to take a holistic approach
    and to have considered all the relevant factors.  The adult  Applicants
    failed  under  paragraph  276ADE.   The  Judge  had  not  followed  the
    jurisprudence in EV (Philippines) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ. 874  although
    she had cited it at  paragraph  11.   She  had  dealt  with  the  child
    Applicants in  a  vacuum  and  then  gone  on  to  consider  the  adult
    Applicants.

16.  Paragraph  16  of  her  decision  did  not  take  into   account   the
    countervailing factors referred to in the SSHD's decision or the use of
    false passports referred to in paragraph 5  of  the  Judge's  decision.
    These matters were relevant as were the benefits which  the  Applicants
    had improperly obtained.  Further, the Judge's treatment of the factors
    referred to in Section 117B of the 2002 Act was inadequate.

Additional Submissions for the Applicants

17. Mr Reza submitted that the fact the adult Applicants could not meet the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE was not reason to  prevent  the  child
    Applicants succeeding.  He referred to paragraph 35 of the judgment  in
    EV (Philippines) which sets out factors upon which the  best  interests
    of children will depend and offered a citation of Zoumbas v SSHD  [...]
    UKSC ... as authority for the proposition that a child's best interests
    can outweigh the public interest.  I noted the submission  was  that  a
    child's best interests can outweigh but not must or in  this  case  did
    outweigh the public interest.  Mr Reza identified paragraph 11  of  the
    Judge's decision as being the balancing exercise conducted by the Judge
    but I pointed out that this simply recorded the submissions made to her
    for each of the parties.

18. Finally, Mr Reza relied on paragraph 18 of the Judge's decision and  in
    particular the first and last sentences stating:-

         "In relation to the parents having already referred to them being a
         family unit which cannot be split up because they are  the  primary
         carers Gulshan did provide the correct  approach  to  human  rights
         cases and it referred to if there are compelling reasons,  which  I
         find would be the situation here if the family should be split  up.
         ... I have taken into account the authority of Zoumbas  and  return
         to the interplay between Article 8 and the best interests  and  the
         cumulative effect on the family the family which is relevant  here,
         noting that Section 55 was not dealt with in the refusal letter."

    In fact the SSHD had  in  the  decision  considered  her  duties  under
    Section 55 of the 2009 Act at pages 4 and 5.

19. Ms Willocks-Briscoe responded that paragraph 18 of the Judge's decision
    contained a material error of law as she had  previously  submitted  in
    that the Judge had considered the child  Applicants  before  the  adult
    Applicants.

Findings and Consideration

20. In EV (Philippines) the Court of Appeal conducted an  extensive  review
    of the numerous authorities about the meaning  and  assessment  of  the
    best interests of a child.  It went on to conclude:-

         "55. Underlying these statements of principle  is  the  real  world
             fact that the parent has no right to remain in the UK.  So  no
             counter-factual assumption is being made, and the interests of
             the other family members are to be considered in the light  of
             the real world  facts.  This  is  not  an  approach  which  is
             confined to domestic law. In �ner v The Netherlands [2007]  45
             EHRR 14, as Lady Hale pointed out, the Grand Chamber said that
             one of the factors to be considered was:

                  "the best interests and well-being  of  the  children,  in
                  particular the seriousness of the difficulties  which  any
                  children of the applicant are likely to encounter  in  the
                  country to which the applicant is to be expelled."

          1. This, too, takes as the starting point  the  real  world  fact
             that the applicant has no right to be  in  the  host  country.
             Likewise in Rodrigues da Silva, Hoogkamer v Netherlands [2007]
             44 EHRR 34 the court said that:

                  "Factors to be taken into account in this context are  the
                  extent to which family life is effectively  ruptured,  the
                  extent of the ties in the contracting state, whether there
                  are insurmountable obstacles in  the  way  of  the  family
                  living in the country of origin of one or  more  of  them,
                  whether there are factors of  immigration  control  (eg  a
                  history of breaches of immigration law) or  considerations
                  of  public  order  weighing  in  favour   of   exclusion."
                  (Emphasis added)

          1. Finally, at [29] Lady Hale returned  to  the  test.  She  said
             that:

                  "Specifically, as Lord Bingham indicated in  EB  (Kosovo),
                  it will involve asking whether it is reasonable to  expect
                  the child to live in another country."

          1.  In  my  judgment,  therefore,  the  assessment  of  the  best
             interests of the children must be made on the basis  that  the
             facts are as they are in the real world. If one parent has  no
             right to remain, but  the  other  parent  does,  that  is  the
             background against  which  the  assessment  is  conducted.  If
             neither parent has the right  to  remain,  then  that  is  the
             background against which the assessment is conducted. Thus the
             ultimate question will be: is  it  reasonable  to  expect  the
             child to follow the parent with no  right  to  remain  to  the
             country of origin?

          1. On the facts of  ZH  it  was  not  reasonable  to  expect  the
             children to follow their mother to Tanzania, not least because
             the family would  be  separated  and  the  children  would  be
             deprived of the right to grow up in the country of which  they
             were citizens.

          1. That is a long way from the facts of our  case.  In  our  case
             none of the family is a British citizen. None has the right to
             remain in this country. If the mother is removed,  the  father
             has no  independent  right  to  remain.  If  the  parents  are
             removed, then it is entirely reasonable to expect the children
             to go  with  them.  As  the  immigration  judge  found  it  is
             obviously  in  their  best  interests  to  remain  with  their
             parents. Although it is, of course a question of fact for  the
             tribunal, I cannot see that the desirability of being educated
             at public expense in the UK can outweigh the  benefit  to  the
             children of remaining with their parents. Just  as  we  cannot
             provide medical treatment for the world, so we cannot  educate
             the world.

    The Judge failed to make findings first about the adult Applicants  and
    then what constituted the best interests of the  child  Applicants  and
    then to conduct any balancing exercise to assess the proportionality of
    the decisions under appeal.

21. The Judge erred in not taking account  of  the  jurisprudence  in  Dube
    (Sections 117A-117D) [2015] UKUT 00090  (IAC)  and  the  several  other
    decisions of the Upper Tribunal explaining the ambit and application of
    Sections 117A-117D of the 2002 Act.  The Judge's treatment  of  Section
    117B in paragraph 19 of her decision is inadequate.

22. The consideration of the Applicants'  claim  under  Article  8  of  the
    European Convention outside the Immigration Rules  did  not  adopt  the
    structure recommended in R (Razgar) v SSHD  [2004]  UKHL  27.   As  the
    Judge granting permission to appeal put it at paragraph 3 of her  grant
    "the Judge's consideration was short on facts,  evidence,  analysis  or
    findings, she had taken a wrong approach and not applied the law".

23. For all these reasons I find that the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision
    contains material errors of law and must be set aside.

24. I note that Mr Reza's firm had only recently been instructed.   He  had
    informed me that the Applicants' had chosen to  stay  outside  for  the
    hearing but that if the matter were to proceed they would  require  and
    interpreter and none had been requested.

25. Consequently, in in the light of Section  12(2)(B)  of  the  Tribunals,
    Courts and  Enforcement  Act  2007  and  paragraph  7.2  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal's Practice Statement of  10  February  2010  as  amended,  the
    appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  for  a  hearing  afresh.
    None of the findings are preserved.

Anonymity

26. There was no request for  an  anonymity  order  and  having  heard  the
    application and considered the papers in the Tribunal file I find  that
    none is warranted.

NOTICE OF DECISION

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained  material  errors  of
    law and is set aside in its entirety.  The appeal is  remitted  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh  before  any  Judge  other  than
    Judge Wellesley-Cole.

    Anonymity direction not made.
