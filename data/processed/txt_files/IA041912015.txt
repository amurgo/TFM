                                                                    Claimant

Representation:
For the claimant: Not represented
For the respondent:    Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Sean Poul Dixon, date of birth 15.11.83, is a citizen  of
    Australia.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Graham promulgated 9.6.15, allowing on  human
    rights grounds the  claimant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State, dated 19.1.15, to refuse his  application  made  on
    29.9.14 to vary leave to enter or remain on the  basis  of  family  and
    private life, and to remove him from the UK, pursuant to section 47  of
    the Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. The  Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 8.5.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Holmes  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    15.7.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 16.2.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. There was no attendance by or on behalf of the claimant and no Rule  24
    reply to the grounds of application for permission to appeal. There  is
    no resistance to the appeal of the Secretary of State.

 6. The absence of the claimant and the apparent lack of  interest  in  the
    appeal is explained  by  the  fact  that  Mr  Dixon  made  a  voluntary
    departure from the UK on  18.11.15  and  has  not  applied  to  return.
    However, his departure does not automatically dispense with the appeal.

 7. For the reasons set out below, I find that there was such error of  law
    in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to required
    the decision of Judge Graham to be set aside and remade, which I do  by
    dismissing the appeal on all grounds.

 8. It is clear for the reasons set out by Judge Graham that having arrived
    as a family visitor the claimant could not meet the requirements of the
    Immigration Rules for leave to remain,  either  under  Appendix  FM  or
    paragraph 276ADE

 9. Judge Graham failed to identify any compelling circumstances to justify
    going on to consider the claimant's  circumstances  outside  the  Rules
    pursuant to article 8 ECHR, pursuant to Singh v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 74
    and SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387. Indeed, at ï¿½18 of the decision  the
    judge specifically found that  there  were  no  such  circumstances  to
    warrant a grant of leave outside the  Rules.  Nevertheless,  the  judge
    went on to conduct an article 8 assessment. To do so in the absence  of
    compelling circumstances was an error of law.

10. In summary, the article 8 proportionality assessment  was  flawed.  The
    judge relied on  the  temporary  absence  of  the  claimant  whilst  he
    returned to Australia to seek entry clearance, stating, "The length  of
    that  absence  cannot  be  determined  precisely  and  because  of  the
    children's young ages and given that  their  father  is  their  primary
    carer any absence by the appellant will have an adverse effect  on  the
    children give(n) their strong connection with him." The judge failed to
    appreciate that the waiting time for an entry clearance application  in
    Australia  is  very  short.  At  the  time  of  the  hearing  100%   of
    applications were processed within 10 days.

11. Further, the judge appears to have  misunderstood  or  misapplied  both
    paragraph 276ADE and section 117B of the  2002  Act,  as  well  as  the
    guidance in SS (Congo) and EV (Philippines). No account  was  taken  of
    the provision that little weight should be accorded to a  private  life
    developed whilst his immigration  status  was  precarious,  or  of  his
    intentions when coming to the UK  where  his  wife  and  children  were
    already present. No weight  is  accorded  to  the  public  interest  in
    maintaining immigration control. No account is given to the  policy  of
    no switching from the visitor route or the inability to meet any  other
    provisions of the Rules.  No  account  was  taken  as  to  whether  the
    claimant would succeed under any future application.

12. This  was  a  family  that  could  safely  live  in  Australia,  either
    indefinitely, or by way of holiday whilst the appellant made his  entry
    clearance application. No reasoned decision was provided as to why  the
    claimant should not be expected to return  to  Australia  to  make  the
    appropriate application, paying the requisite fee. If, as  claimed,  he
    could now meet the requirements for entry clearance, and his  wife  and
    children chose to remain in the UK, the period of absence would be very
    short. The decision fails to identify adequate reasons  why  he  should
    effectively be granted 3 years discretionary leave  when  a  spouse  is
    only granted a probationary period of 2 years.  In  the  circumstances,
    the finding that there would be disproportionate interference to family
    life caused by removal of the claimant was irrational. In essence, this
    was a freewheeling approach to article 8 that cannot be sustained.

13. On the facts of this case as set out in the decision of the  First-tier
    Tribunal, there is nothing  either  disproportionate  or  unjustifiably
    harsh in requiring the claimant to leave the UK to make entry clearance
    application from Australia. This  is  not  a  Chikwamba  case,  as  the
    application for entry clearance is not just a formality;  the  claimant
    will have to  demonstrate  that  he  can  meet  all  the  requirements,
    including the financial threshold; on evidence the Secretary  of  State
    is entitled to examine. There is  also  to  be  considered  the  public
    policy of deterring those entering as  visitors  from  short-circuiting
    the immigration route all other applicants have to follow. There was  a
    route for entry clearance that  the  claimant  could  and  should  have
    followed rather than entry as a family visitor. In summary, this is  an
    appeal that from the outset had no prospect of success, and should have
    been dismissed at the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing.

Conclusions:

14. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it on
                    all grounds.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.
