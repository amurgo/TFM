                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Ripley promulgated on 23rd April 2018 dismissing her appeal against the
    respondent's decision dated 14th June 2016 to  refuse  her  application
    for leave to remain pursuant to Appendix FM, paragraph  276ADE  and  on
    Article 8 grounds.

 2. The appeal as set out by Judge Ripley was linked to the appeals of  the
    appellant's daughter (appeal reference EA/00172/2017) and the father of
    her daughter AZ (appeal reference EA/06790/2016).

 3. Mr Z is married to a Czech national TZ.  Judge Ripley considered Mr Z's
    appeal at the same time as  hearing  the  appellant's  appeal  in  this
    matter.

 4. It was asserted that the appellant had a relationship  with  Mr  Z  and
    they had produced a daughter.  It was submitted that Mr Z, his wife (T,
    an EU national),  the  appellant  and  the  daughter  all  lived  in  a
    polygamous relationship together.

 5. The appellant is a Taiwanese national born on 26th  August  1976.   She
    states she first visited the United Kingdom in 2014 and stayed with  Mr
    Z.   She returned for a second visit in 2015 and  fell  pregnant.   She
    travelled with Mr Z to Belgium, was  refused  re-entry  to  the  United
    Kingdom and detained. She was released but has no lawful status in  the
    United Kingdom.   The  child  was  born  on  6th  February  2016.   The
    appellant claimed that she and her dependent child were unable to leave
    the United Kingdom and return to Taiwan as they feared for their safety
    there, because she was married, and her husband still resided in Taiwan
    and she had chosen to have a child with another man.  As a result,  her
    husband would attempt to harm her should she return.

 6. That application was refused by the Secretary of  State  on  the  basis
    that Mr Z was neither her spouse nor her fiancï¿½ and she could not  meet
    the Rules under Appendix FM.  The Secretary of  State  did  not  accept
    that her relationship with her partner was genuine  and  subsisting  or
    that she had been living with him in a relationship  akin  to  marriage
    because the claimed partner was married and  still  in  a  relationship
    with his spouse.  In fact, the Secretary of State  also  asserted  that
    the partner's relationship was rejected as a marriage of convenience.

 7. Her application was also  considered  on  the  basis  of  her  parental
    relationship with her child who was in fact a national of Taiwan and/or
    Pakistan.  It was noted that the dependent child had leave to remain in
    the United  Kingdom,  but  the  appellant  claimed  to  live  with  her
    dependent child, her claimed partner the child's father and the partner
    spouse.  She did not have sole parental responsibility  for  the  child
    and was unable to meet the eligibility requirements  of  E-LTRPT.2.3(a)
    of Appendix FM.

 8. Her private life was considered but rejected under paragraph 276ADE and
    on the basis of exceptional  circumstances.   The  Secretary  of  State
    found it was open to the appellant to remove with  the  child  and  the
    impact of removing the child would  be  nominal  at  best.   There  was
    nothing to preventing the  child's  father  the  claimed  partner  from
    joining her and her child  in  Taiwan  where  there  was  an  education
    system.  There were no exceptional or compelling circumstances.

 9. It is important to state that there was  no  DNA  evidence  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal of the  relationship  between  the  child  and  the
    father.

10. The judge made the following findings:

    (i)    The judge accepted that the appellant  and  Mr  Z  had  a  child
         together and although there was  no  DNA  evidence,  there  was  no
         challenge made in the reasons for refusal  letter  to  the  claimed
         parentage.

    (ii)   The judge accepted that the appellant and her partner Mr Z  were
         a couple.  The  judge  accepted  the  evidence  to  show  that  the
         appellant currently lived with the father and her  child  and  that
         she continued to have a sexual relationship with him.

11. The judge stated with reference to that relationship at paragraph 28:

         "I am satisfied that  was  purposefully  omitted  in  the  evidence
         beforehand  in  the  hearing  and  in  the  extensive  letters  and
         statements  written  before  the  appeal  because  the  appellant's
         partner was concerned that this may undermine his argument that his
         marriage was not one of convenience.  This was the subject  of  his
         linked appeal."

         'There is family life between the appellant, her partner and  their
         child.  If the appellant was to be removed  from  the  UK  and  her
         partner and child remained as is their EEA right, then  this  would
         constitute an interference to their family life.  I must find  that
         refusal of this appeal would have consequences of such  gravity  to
         engage Article 8' [29].

12. The judge noted that the respondent had disputed that  the  appellant's
    relationship with her partner and her  daughter  or  her  private  life
    entitled her to leave within the Rules and he found

    . Under the Immigration Rules the appellant's partner was  not  British
         or settled contrary to paragraph E-LTRP.1.2 and

              'Her daughter is neither British and nor her (sic) she  lived
             here for seven years and thus  the  appellant  cannot  qualify
             under the parent route of Appendix FM' [30].

    . In relation to a protection claim or claim for asylum on reliance  on
         fear of return to Taiwan because of the adultery laws, this  was  a
         new matter which had not been consented to by the respondent [31].

    . The appellant had claimed that she had no ties in Taiwan but had  not
         provided evidence to explain why this was or why she was unable  to
         develop relationships during the years that she  lived  in  Taiwan,
         she did not suffer from poor health and although she stated she did
         not speak Chinese fluently and would find it difficult to work, the
         appellant's partner could either go with her  or  alternatively  he
         could  support  her  and  his  daughter's  childcare   costs   from
         employment in the UK.  She could use her skills to  assist  her  to
         secure employment in Taiwan [32].

    . It was not accepted that the appellant's status as a single mother or
         as a mother of a child born out of wedlock these  would  cause  her
         significant  difficulty.   The  judge  did  not  find  overall  the
         difficulties she would face would be obstacles  to  integration  on
         the grounds of her gender [33].

    . The judge recorded the primary issue on compelling circumstances were
         that the daughter and appellant's  partner  had  EEA  rights.   The
         judge accepted that the appellant's partner was not a  party  to  a
         marriage of convenience and thus he and his  daughter  fell  within
         the definition of family members of an EEA national [34].

    .  When  considering  whether  there  was  family  life   between   the
         appellant's partner and his wife the judge noted at [38]  that  the
         appellant's  partner's  evidence  and  that  of  his   wife's   was
         discrepant.  Reasons were given at paragraph 38 and  paragraph  39.
         The judge found the inconsistencies  significantly  undermined  the
         reliability of the evidence.  The judge did not accept that Mrs  TZ
         would  wish  to  continue  to  live  with  her   husband   in   the
         circumstances where both were having sexual relationships with him.
          She was not dependent on him.  The judge did not  accept  at  [40]
         that the appellant's partner Mr Z was continuing to  enjoy  such  a
         relationship with his wife.

    . At paragraph 42 the judge accepted that the appellant's  partner  and
         his wife continued to share the same home.

    . In  relation  to  proportionality  the  judge  noted  that  case  law
         suggested that family life relying on  Article  8  should  only  be
         respected in monogamous relationships although he was alive to  the
         issue of whether the interference was proportionate nonetheless.

    . The judge factored in Section 117 and that she  could  speak  English
         and earn sufficient funds, was a neutral factor in accordance  with
         Rhuppiah v The Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2016]
         EWCA Civ 803.  The judge found it would not be disproportionate for
         the appellant's partner to choose whether he wishes to remain  with
         his wife or live with the appellant.  This  was  not  a  compelling
         ground to support her claim outside the Rules.

    . The EEA Regulations did not provide for more than one  partner  at  a
         time.  Requiring the appellant's partner to leave if he  wished  to
         maintain his family life with another  woman  would  not  interfere
         with Mrs TZ's EEA rights or indeed the appellant's.

    . The judge considered Section  55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
         Immigration Act 2009 in respect of the child's best interests.  The
         child referred to Mrs TZ as auntie.  The child was over 2 years old
         and if separated from Mrs TZ she would miss her initially  but  her
         primary relationships were with her parents.  She was too young  to
         have an established private life outside the family [47].

    . The appellant's partner had lived in the UK for four  years  and  the
         appellant for only two years.  They had provided no evidence of  an
         established private life  beyond  her  partner's  employment.   The
         appellant's partner's residence was lawful but the  judge  was  not
         satisfied  that  requiring  them  to  leave  the  UK  would  be   a
         disproportionate breach.  The appellant's partner had not  acquired
         independent residence rights but had been dependent on  his  wife's
         EEA right.

    . It was acknowledged that the appellant's  partner  and  her  daughter
         were not Taiwanese nationals but they could apply for visas.

Application for Permission to Appeal

13. It was advanced that it was not shown that they could not  successfully
    apply for Taiwanese visas because that had not been  raised.   Secondly
    the appellant could not apply for  residence  in  Pakistan  without  an
    original passport that detail  went  completely  unacknowledged.   Then
    similarly  the  appellant's  partner  and  daughter  cannot  apply  for
    Taiwanese residencies without the appellant's passport or the  original
    Taiwanese ID card.

14. Secondly the judge agreed at paragraph 34 that the appellant's  partner
    and his daughter fell within the definition of EEA family  members  and
    had a right to reside in the UK on this basis and the appellant's child
    would have to lose one of the  parents  because  one  child  could  not
    successfully apply for residence in the country of each other's origin.
     It would not be proportionate to uphold removal of the spouse if there
    was a close and genuine bond with the other spouse  or  the  effect  is
    that to sever a genuine and subsisting relationship between parent  and
    child.  The best interests of the child were an integral  part  of  the
    proportionality assessment and the best interests of the child must  be
    a primary consideration.  The judge had not emphasised enough the  best
    interests of the child.  Further, the EU Directive accepted that  step-
    children were a part of the EEA family member  but  clearly  recognised
    the need of establishing a bond between step  "kids"  (sic)  and  step-
    parents.  It should have  been  decided  what  was  reasonable  in  the
    circumstances.   There  was  a  breach  of  the   subsisting   parental
    relationship between the appellant and her child who would lose one  of
    the parents in the case of removal of the appellant which was a  breach
    of the EU charter of fundamental rights.

15. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis  that  "the  wrong  legal
    test had been applied in  the  Article  8  claim".   The  decision  was
    whether it was proportionate.

16. At the hearing Mr Melvin submitted that  the  judge  had  set  out  the
    evidence at paragraphs 38 and 39.  There were significant discrepancies
    in the evidence.





The Hearing

17. At the hearing the appellant did not attend and I am satisfied that she
    was given the date, time and  venue  of  the  hearing.   There  was  no
    written authority by Ms Wang for Mr Z to act  on  her  behalf  or  give
    evidence in relation to her case albeit that he was insistent that  she
    was unable to attend  because  of  the  childcare.   I  considered  the
    written grounds for permission to appeal.

Conclusions

18. The appellant did not attend her own hearing. She had been  advised  of
    the date time  and  venue.   There  was  no  indication  that  she  had
    attempted to secure any form of legal representation and in the absence
    of written authorisation it is not clear that Mr  Z  had  authority  to
    make submissions on her  behalf.   There  was  no  application  for  an
    adjournment, written or otherwise, and in the circumstances, I consider
    that it was fair to proceed with the hearing of which the appellant had
    ample notice.

19. I am not persuaded that the decision in any way transgressed the rights
    of the appellant or failed to consider the best interests of the child.
     The appellant had been in the UK for only two  years,  illegally,  and
    she could not fulfil the Immigration Rules. It was claimed she lived in
    a  polygamous  relationship.    As  the  judge  found  there   was   no
    requirement that the child leaves the jurisdiction (if  she  is  an  EU
    national) and it was a matter for the appellant and her said partner as
    to whether they wished to be together in  either  Taiwan  or  Pakistan.
    This was not an application on the basis of the EU Regulations.

20. The judge  carefully  considered  the  child's  rights  throughout  the
    decision and specifically at [47]. I refer  to  the  findings  outlined
    above. On the conclusions of the judge it is clear that  the  appellant
    was not the only primary carer of the child  and  I  repeat  the  judge
    found there was no requirement to remove the child from the  EU.   That
    as the judge found was a matter for the parents to  decide.  The  judge
    was entitled to make that finding.   The judge specifically referred to
    and directed himself in line with ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4 and Azimi-
    Moyayed (decisions affecting children) UKUT 00197.

21. It is not sustainable to maintain  that  the  judge  failed  to  direct
    himself legally appropriately with reference to the balancing  exercise
    and assessment  on  proportionality.    Paragraph  [43]  is  given  the
    heading of 'proportionality' and the judge  clearly  had  the  relevant
    test in mind.  The judge considered  the  relevant  factors  throughout
    and, in the round, and at [45] found there were no  vulnerabilities  on
    the part of the appellant, her partner,  or  his  claimed  EU  national
    wife.  The judge considered the wider  rights  of  those  involved  but
    found overall the decision to remove the appellant,  having  considered
    the best interests of the child, and having applied Section 117 of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 the appellant  not  to  be
    disproportionate.

22. There was no evidence in relation to visas  before  the  judge  and  no
    reason to suppose that one or other could not apply for visas  to  join
    the other on their country of origin that is either Taiwan or Pakistan.
     The judge cannot be criticised for  considering  material  not  before
    him. As the judge  found  at  [49]  there  was  no  evidence  that  the
    appellant and the child could not apply for visas in Pakistan.

23. It is not clear on a careful reading of the decision, bearing  in  mind
    the discrepancies found in the  evidence  that  the  judge  erred.   He
    applied the correct test in relation to proportionality  and  addressed
    the best interests of the child.

         Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013] UKUT 00085 (IAC)

         'Although there is a legal duty to give a brief explanation of  the
         conclusions on the central issue on which an appeal is  determined,
         those reasons need not be extensive if  the  decision  as  a  whole
         makes sense, having regard to the material accepted by the judge'.

24. I therefore find no error of law in the decision of  Judge  Ripley  and
    the decision will stand.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead  to  contempt  of  court  proceedings.   This
decision refers to a minor hence this order.
