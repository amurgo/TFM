For the respondent:         Mr.E.Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

       1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan who, on 15 March 2016,
          applied for a residence card as confirmation of his right to
          reside in the United Kingdom further to European Treaty
          provisions. The application made was on the basis he was an
          extended family member and dependant on his sibling and his
          Romanian wife.

       2. The respondent refused the application on 9 September 2016 on the
          basis he had not provided evidence of dependency before he came to
          United Kingdom or thereafter.

       3. Her appeal was heard before First-tier Tribunal Judge Rayner at
          Taylor House on 5th September 2017. In a decision promulgated on
          11th September 2017 the judge found there was no jurisdiction to
          hear the appeal. This was on the basis of the guidance given in
          the Upper Tribunal decision of Sala (EFM's: right of appeal)
          [2016] UKUT 00411.

       4. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal has been granted in
          light of the Court of Appeal decision of Khan -v- SSHD [2017] EWCA
          Civ 1755 which held that the decision in Sala was wrong.

       5. At the hearing, Mr.Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer
          acknowledged that the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Rayner
          in declining jurisdiction materially erred in law as it is now
          understood. He helpfully provided me with a copy of the decision
          of SM (Algeria) -v-ECO [2018] UKSC 9 where the Supreme Court
          reaffirmed Khan -v- SSHD.

       6. Given that an error of law has been accepted the disposal of the
          appeal requires a fresh hearing before the First-tier Tribunal.
          Given the factual issues which will have to be decided a remittal
          is called for.

 Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Rayner materially errs in law and
is set aside. There are no material facts to preserve. The matter is
remitted for a de novo hearing before the First tier Tribunal.
