Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D. Clarke, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Spurling, Counsel instructed on behalf of the
Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State with permission, appeals against the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Lingam) (hereinafter referred to as  the
    "FtTJ") who, in a determination promulgated  on  the  19th  March  2019
    allowed his appeal against the decision of the Respondent dated 22 July
    2018 to refuse his human rights claim.

 2. Whilst the Secretary of  State  is  the  appellant,  for  the  sake  of
    convenience I intend to refer to the parties as they  were  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh. His immigration  history  is
    set  out  within  the  determination  at  paragraphs  1-6  of  the  FtT
    determination and in the comprehensive decision letter  issued  by  the
    Secretary  of  State  of  the  24th  July  2018  entitled  "notice   of
    cancellation of leave". It can be summarised briefly  as  follows.  The
    appellant entered the United Kingdom in  January  2009  with  leave  to
    enter as a Tier 4 General student valid until 30th April  2012.  On  28
    April 2012 he applied for further leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General)
    student, but the application was refused on 12 July 2012 has he  failed
    to meet the maintenance requirements.

 4. On 31 July 2012 he submitted a further application for leave to  remain
    and as a result was granted leave to remain until 28  June  2014  as  a
    Tier 4 student. On 10 June 2013 he was granted further leave to  remain
    as a Tier 4 (General) student until 13 March 2016.

 5. On  5  September  2015  when  returning  to  the  United  Kingdom,  the
    immigration officer made routine checks against the Home Office records
    which showed that he had sought leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom
    by deception. This related to the  TOEIC  certificate  awarded  to  him
    following the test taken on 20 March 2012 at Elizabeth  College,  which
    he submitted as part of his application for leave to remain on 31  July
    2012. That certificate was found by ETS to be invalid and  fraudulently
    obtained.

 6. As a consequence, the leave granted to him  was  cancelled  under  rule
    321A (2) of the immigration rules  as  it  was  asserted  that  he  had
    obtained  leave  to  remain  by  deception.  The  immigration   officer
    therefore cancelled his leave to remain and refused him leave to  enter
    the United Kingdom on 5 September 2015.

 7. Following the cancellation of leave, the appellant lodged a  claim  for
    judicial review challenging the decision and in particular, that he had
    used deception. The claim for judicial review  was  considered  on  the
    papers by an Upper Tribunal Judge (Judge Jordan) who refused permission
    on 29 February 2016. However on an oral renewal  hearing  on  3  August
    2016 Upper Tribunal Judge Kekic granted permission on the basis that it
    was arguable that it had not been not adequately  explained  why  leave
    had been cancelled and that the Secretary of State did not have  regard
    to material  evidence  available  to  her  when  making  the  decision,
    specifically the interview record undertaken by one of the officers and
    the fact that the applicant was studying for a postgraduate degree.

 8. It appears that the parties entered into a consent order shortly before
    the substantive judicial  review  hearing.  The  respondent  agreed  to
    reconsider the decision but  made  a  new  decision  on  8  April  2017
    maintaining the earlier decision to cancel  his  leave.  The  applicant
    sought administrative review against the second decision. In a  further
    decision dated 28 April 2017 the original decision was maintained,  and
    the administrative review refused.

 9. The appellant filed a second judicial review application and permission
    was granted on 6 April 2018 (see appendix L). The basis of  that  grant
    was that the cancellation of leave engaged  Article  8  which  required
    procedural fairness so that the applicant could be given an opportunity
    to challenge the respondent's decision in which deception was alleged.

10. According to the decision letter of 24 July 2018,  at  paragraph  6  it
    states that the judicial review was conceded by the Secretary of  State
    and that the decisions of 8 April 2017 and  the  administrative  review
    decision of 28th of April 2017 had been withdrawn. It  makes  reference
    to the decision of 8 April 2017 being reissued to provide the appellant
    with an alternative remedy of an in-country right of appeal. Therefore,
    the decision of 24 July 2018 was said to be a "reconsideration  of  the
    decision to cancel your leave on arrival."

11. The decision of 24 July 2018 entitled "notice of cancellation of  leave
    to enter "sets out the immigration history and the  litigation  is  set
    out above. The letter made reference to the appellants  interview  with
    the immigration officer taken in September 2015.

12. It was noted that the interview notes were taken three years after  the
    TOEIC testing question, but whilst the officer concluded  that  he  was
    "fluent" in English, it did not demonstrate whether he was  fluent  the
    time of the original test. At paragraph  17,  the  respondent  set  out
    answers given by the appellant relevant to his circumstances  in  2012.
    The respondent considered that the replies demonstrated that he was not
    confident in English language and that he was running out of time  with
    regards to extending his leave to remain in the UK. He took the test on
    20 March 2012 and his leave was expiring on  30  April.  Thus,  it  was
    asserted that he had a motive to use a proxy due to  uncertainty  as  a
    result of this lack of confidence in English and running  out  of  time
    with regards to the application.

13.  The  respondent  relied  upon  the  ETS  lookup  tool  confirming  his
    certificate was invalid (appendix 1). Further evidence relied upon  was
    set out at paragraph 20  of  the  decision  letter,  including  generic
    evidence from Peter Millington, Rebecca  Collings,  Dr  Harrison,  Prof
    French and a project fa�ade report in relation to abuse of the TOEIC at
    Elizabeth College dated 15  May  2015  and  a  report  commissioned  in
    October 2016 accompanied by witness statement of Adam Sewell.

14. At paragraphs 21 - 31 the  respondent  set  out  an  analysis  of  that
    evidence.

15. At paragraphs 32 - 38 the respondent set out a summary of  the  project
    fa�ade report noting that between 18 October 2011 and 26 September 2012
    Elizabeth College undertook 3919 TOEIC speaking and  writing  tests  of
    which 69% were invalid and  therefore  show  the  organised  widespread
    abuse that took place there. It made reference to an incident on 15 May
    2012, two months after it took the test when  ETS  conducted  an  audit
    during which an ETS auditor suspected that an impostor was  sitting  at
    the test on behalf of the candidate. One test  taker  who  scores  were
    found to be invalid and been interviewed admitted that an impostor  had
    taken the test and also name the agent that had arranged it.  Financial
    enquiries established that payments from six TOEIC candidates were well
    in excess of the test fee were made into a named directors account.

16. At paragraphs 39 - 43 the respondent made reference  to  the  Elizabeth
    College report  commissioned  in  October  2016.  An  analysis  of  the
    credibility of the results achieved at the test centre were  undertaken
    and at appendix 10 the analyst concluded that the majority of tests  at
    Elizabeth College were not conducted under genuine test conditions  and
    that the  results  reported  by  Elizabeth  College  were  not  a  true
    reflection of the English ability of  the  candidates.  The  respondent
    therefore concluded at paragraph  43  that  the  presumption  of  fraud
    applied in  the  appellant's  case  and  that  the  objective  evidence
    strongly demonstrated widespread fraudulent activity at the college and
    that as he had reasons to use a proxy, it was  concluded  that  he  had
    obtained his TOEIC certificate by deception and cancelled his leave  to
    remain pursuant to rule 321A(2) of immigration rules.

17. The respondent was also satisfied that his leave to remain should  been
    cancelled under a change of  circumstances.  In  this  respect  it  was
    stated at paragraph 44 that ETS cancelled his language certificate  and
    that was a change in circumstances since leave  was  given  to  justify
    cancellation at port. It was stated "I take the view that there  is  no
    requirement to prove fraud individually against you in order to  cancel
    your lead to remain in the UK. This is because  I'm  satisfied  that  a
    widescale  Ford  had  been  revealed,  that  ETS  had  carried  out  an
    investigation and ETS  had  chosen  to  cancel  your  English  language
    certificate leading to the change in your circumstances which  resulted
    in my decision to also cancel your leave under rule 321A(1). "

18. There is also a decision letter which was a decision on a human  rights
    claim. As far as I understand the position, as part of  a  section  120
    notice served in April 2017, the Home Office considered it as  a  human
    right claim and rejected it as clearly unfounded under  section  94  of
    the NI AA 2002. The  appellant  did  not  challenge  the  human  rights
    decision that was dated 16 June 2017 and it was not part of the consent
    order. However, it appears that decision was withdrawn but the decision
    on his human rights claim had been reissued and was not  now  certified
    which provided the appellant with an in-country right of  appeal.  That
    decision set out at appendix M and is dated 22 July 2018.  It  is  this
    decision which brought the proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal.

19. In that decision, his immigration history is set out again and  it  was
    noted that the appellant had not informed the respondent  that  he  had
    any partner, parent or dependent children and therefore the application
    was not considered under Appendix FM. It was also noted that there were
    no provisions under the immigration rules for a person  to  be  granted
    leave to enter on account of a private life established in  the  United
    Kingdom. Under the  heading  "exceptional  circumstances"  and  whether
    there would be exceptional circumstances render a refusal in breach  of
    Article 8 on the basis that it  would  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences for the appellant, it was stated that there were  no  such
    exceptional circumstances to warrant a grant of leave to remain outside
    the rules. It made reference to his claim to have family members in the
    UK, but no details been provided. The decision letter made reference to
    his claim that he was completely integrated with  his  sister's  family
    and that he would be liable to hardship if returned to  Bangladesh.  In
    this context it was noted that he was a 27-year-old adult  and  it  was
    reasonable to expect and  be  able  to  support  himself  independently
    without the direct support from family members.

20. In respect of the allegation of deception, the  respondent  again  made
    reference to the information set out in the  previous  decision  noting
    that his scores from the test taken on 20 March 2012 Elizabeth  College
    had been cancelled by  ETS  and  that  he  had  used  deception  in  an
    application dated 31 July 2012. It  was  stated  that  in  fraudulently
    obtaining a certificate he participated in what was  an  organised  and
    serious attempt to defraud the Home Office. It was then noted that  his
    case had been considered with regard to the  possibility  that  he  had
    established a  private  life,  but  he  provided  no  evidence  of  the
    substance of that private life. He had not been in the  United  Kingdom
    20 years nor did he  demonstrate  very  significant  obstacles  to  his
    integration if required to leave the United Kingdom. He had never  been
    settled in the United  Kingdom  and  was  refused  leave  to  enter  in
    September 2015. He should not be entitled to benefit from a  breach  of
    immigration control.

21. The Appellant appealed that decision and the  appeal  came  before  the
    First- Tier Tribunal at a hearing on the 6th March 2019.

22. In a determination promulgated on  the  19th   March  2019,   the  FtTJ
    allowed the appeal on  the  basis  that  she  was  satisfied  that  the
    respondent's decision under Paragraph 321(A) was , in essence,  not  in
    accordance with the law and  as  stated  at  paragraph  47  "Given  the
    appellant argues Article 8 in the alternative, I am satisfied  that  it
    is not necessary for me to determine his Article 8 rights" and at 48, "
    The appellant succeeds in his appeal. The decision is wrong in law."

23. The Respondent sought permission to appeal that decision and permission
    was granted by the First-tier Tribunal on the 17th April 2019.

24. The appeal was therefore listed before the Upper  Tribunal.  Mr  Clarke
    relied upon the grounds save that he did not rely upon  paragraphs  4-6
    and 8 which referred to evidence which the respondent asserted that had
    come to their attention after the hearing  relating  to  the  appellant
    obtaining his voice recording. Mr Clarke stated that there had been  no
    evidence provided or filed and served on the appellant or the  Tribunal
    and he was in no position to advance those grounds.

25.  In the written grounds it is stated that the judge  had  no  power  to
    allow the appeal under the rules when the Tribunal's  jurisdiction  was
    limited to human  rights  and  that  no  family  or  private  life  was
    identified or any respective  breach  of  either  category  to  justify
    allowing the appeal.

26. It was stated that the appellant had had no leave to remain  two  years
    prior to the human rights claim being made in light of the cancellation
    decision. It was said that was no consideration  of  the  human  rights
    aspect or on grounds specific to the appellant  and  that  his  witness
    statement (page 25) did not set out a human  right  claim  and  it  was
    specific to ETS. There was no evidence put forward in relation  to  his
    private life in light of the lack of leave.

27. Mr Spurling, who did not appear before the First-tier Tribunal provided
    a skeleton argument in lieu of the rule 24 response.  In  that  written
    response he set out at paragraph 2 the following:

         "it is accepted that the Secretary of State has identified material
         errors of law in the determination as noted at paragraph 3 and  the
         grant of permission:

          a) when  the  FTTJ  purported  to  allow  the  appeal  under  the
             immigration rules she erred because,  in  consequence  of  the
             changes of the Immigration Act 2014 he did not have a right of
             appeal on the basis that the decision was  not  in  accordance
             with immigration rules; and

          b) when the judge declared it was not necessary to determine  the
             respondent's Article 8 rights the judge erred because, in  the
             factual premises of this case and in consequence  the  changes
             wrought by the Immigration Act 2014, the only  grounds  appeal
             to the appellant was that the Secretary  of  State's  decision
             was incompatible with his Article 8 rights.

         Nevertheless, it is submitted that these errors did not infect  the
         findings of fact, which were open to her  on  the  evidence  before
         her. It is submitted that the proper disposal of this case would be
         for the Upper Tribunal to allow the Secretary of State's appeal  on
         the limited basis that the FtTJ failed to consider the  appellant's
         case under Article 8 in light of the facts found and to  remit  the
         case to the First-tier Tribunal to  reach  findings  on  his  human
         rights appeal in light of the preserved findings of  fact  and  any
         further relevant evidence produced by the parties."

28. Therefore, as set out above and in his oral submissions it  was  agreed
    by Mr Spurling that the error identified at paragraph 1  was  made  out
    and that if the Secretary of State's appeal  against  the  findings  of
    fact relating to the TOEIC certificate was dismissed, it should  return
    to the FtT by way of remittal on that  limited  basis  with  the  other
    findings being preserved.

29. Mr Clarke also agreed with that approach. In the light of the agreement
    reached by both advocates that there was a material error of law as set
    out in paragraph 1 of the grounds and that  this  is  material  to  the
    outcome and that it should be remitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal  on
    this issue, there only remains  one  outstanding  issue  that  requires
    determination. That issue relates to the remaining grounds in which the
    Secretary of State challenges the findings of fact  made  by  the  FtTJ
    relating to the issue of deception.

30. As I have set out above Mr Clarke  withdrew  paragraphs  4  -6  of  the
    grounds. No  evidence  has  ever  been  served  in  relation  to  these
    allegations, either before the FtTJ not before the Upper Tribunal.   In
    the circumstances those allegations cannot, nor should they,  form  any
    part of the case and  I  observe  that  it  is  difficult  to  see  how
    permission could have been granted in relation to those  grounds  where
    no evidence in support had either been advanced before the FtT nor  had
    it been identified how that material now (even  on  the  basis  it  was
    available) would be admissible at this stage.

31. He made the following oral submissions. He stated that at paragraph  42
    the judge stated that there was no direct  evidence  of  the  appellant
    having cheated in his English language test but that ignored  the  look
    tool. That had been referred to at paragraph  27  in  the  respondent's
    evidence. He submitted that the evidential landscape had moved  on  and
    it was important to consider the direct evidence of  the  lookup  tool.
    The appellant's score was invalidated as  shown  by  the  evidence  -64
    (47%) were questionable and 71 (53%) were invalid and that demonstrated
    direct  evidence.  But  taking  into  account  the   generic   evidence
    demonstrates that appellant scores were invalidated.  The  checks  show
    that the false positives are less than 1% therefore it was not true  to
    say that that was no direct evidence against the appellant. The  direct
    evidence was due to his test being invalidated.

32. The next point made by Mr Clarke related  to  paragraph  38  where  the
    judge made reference to the port interview which took place three years
    after the test. The judge noted that the immigration officer found that
    he was fluent, but this had to be looked at in the context of it taking
    place three years after the test. He referred to the  decision  of  MA,
    the Tribunal recognised reasons why someone fraudulently  would  use  a
    proxy to take the test. Therefore, he submitted that there should  have
    been a more holistic assessment of the evidence.

33. The last point he relied upon related to paragraph 40 where  the  judge
    made reference to an argument that the test results because they relate
    to 135 students which meant that all 135 individuals cheated  in  their
    test papers. The judge stated "given the numbers it  is  not  plausible
    that all rooms or every individual had used a proxy. I accept that  the
    figures make the claim untenable." In this respect he submitted that it
    was not the case that 135 tests were invalidated but 71 and  also  some
    were questionable. It  is  therefore  arguable  that  the  finding  was
    unsustainable. He therefore invited  the  Tribunal  to  find  that  the
    judge's findings of fact were insufficient to deal with  the  issue  of
    deception in light of the evidence.

34. Mr Spurling relied upon paragraph 5 of his  written  submissions.  They
    can be summarised as follows:

      i) paragraph 2 is a disagreement with the FtTJ's findings.  The  judge
         was plainly aware of and took account of the ETS lookup tool  which
         the judge referred to at paragraphs 10, 11 and 28. The lookup  tool
         is a record of an allegation which is not backed up by any detailed
         record of specific investigation of his  test  results.  Therefore,
         the judge was entirely right to  say  paragraph  42  there  was  no
         direct evidence of him cheating.

     ii) Paragraph 3 is also disagreement. The judge  did  not  place  undue
         emphasis on the  interview.  At  [37]  so  judge  noted  that  "the
         observation of the initial immigration officer sits  at  odds  with
         the subsequent decision-making officers view  of  his  credibility"
         and then went on to consider "a  plethora  of  evidence"  that  the
         appellant had taken the language tests several times  prior  to  20
         March  2012  and  additional  evidence  relating  to  his  language
         proficiency in the test he had taken.

    iii) Paragraphs 5(c)-(d) related to paragraphs 4 - 6 of the respondent's
         grounds which had been withdrawn by Mr Clarke.

     iv) Paragraph 7 was a difference of opinion. The judge was entitled  to
         find on the evidence that it was inherently implausible that  every
         single test carried out by the college on  the  day  the  appellant
         took his test was fraudulent. Even if it can be shown that many  or
         most of them were, it did not inevitably follow that  all  of  them
         were (relying on Underhill LJ in Ahsan at [2]. Therefore, the judge
         was entitled to make a finding paragraph 40.

      v) Paragraph 8 speculative and unsupported by evidence.

35. In respect of paragraph 40, he submitted that on his  understanding  of
    the last sentence of that paragraph which stated  "I  accept  that  the
    figures make the claim untenable" is that the judge  was  referring  to
    the claim that all 135 cheated. However, the judge was stating that 135
    cheating on one day was not tenable and therefore paragraph 40 did  not
    take it further by either side.

36. As to the lookup tool, the judge was entitled to state that  there  was
    no direct evidence and the tool recorded a conclusion and did not  tell
    how the conclusion was reached in the  appellant's  case.  It  was  not
    accompanied by any notes explaining any samples of detailed conclusions
    and there was no record of any investigation or indication of any time.
    The other evidence was not direct evidence for example, the  report  of
    Prof French. Mr Spurling submitted that the judge was entitled to  take
    into account the individual evidence put forward by the appellant  when
    assessing his competence in the English language. It was not  just  the
    immigration officers' interview -it was  that  he  had  passed  English
    language test prior to the ETS test and the surrounding evidence showed
    him to have been competent in English and  having  passed  an  advanced
    degree. The grounds in this respect are simply a disagreement.

 Decision:

37. The only issue in contention relates to the issue of deception relating
    to the use of an English Language  certificate  to  obtain  leave.  The
    allegation was set out in the decision letter in which  it  was  stated
    that in an application made by the Appellant on the 31st July  2012  he
    had submitted a TOEIC certificate from ETS. The test scores were  taken
    on 20th March 2012 at Elizabeth College, but they had been cancelled by
    ETS.

38. I have therefore considered the decision of the FtTJ. At paragraphs  20
    -  26  the  judge  summarised  the  decision  letter  which   expressly
    considered the issue of deception, including the  interview  that  took
    place with the appellant in 2015 and the decision of MA which  it  made
    reference to the range of reasons  as  to  why  someone  proficient  in
    English may engage in TOIEC fraud (paragraph 25).

39. At paragraphs 27 - 29 the judge  made  reference  to  the  respondent's
    evidence, including the generic evidence but importantly  at  paragraph
    28 the source datasheet confirming the appellant scored  180  marks  in
    the speaking test which was deemed "invalid" and that the  lookup  tool
    for the specified date showed that  135  students  who  sat  for  their
    tests, 64 or 47% were questionable and 71 or 53% were  deemed  invalid.
    At paragraph 29 the judge made reference to the evidence that  was  set
    out in the project fa�ade report and  the  review  taken  of  Elizabeth
    College.

40. At paragraphs 30 - 33, the judge properly directed herself to the  case
    law and the burden and standard of proof in relation to  the  deception
    issue. The legal burden of proving that the  applicant  used  deception
    lies on the Secretary of State albeit there is a three- stage  process.
    The Secretary of State must first adduce sufficient evidence  to  raise
    the issue of fraud. The claimant  has  then  a  burden  of  raising  an
    innocent explanation which satisfies the minimum level of plausibility.
    If that burden is discharged, the Secretary of State must establish  on
    the balance of probabilities that this innocent explanation  is  to  be
    rejected. There is one civil standard of proof (which is  the  standard
    to be applied). The seriousness of the consequences does not require  a
    different standard of proof that flexibility in  its  application  will
    involve consideration of the strength and quality of the evidence.  The
    more serious the consequence, the stronger must be  the  evidence  used
    for the necessary standard to be reached.

41. In the decision of SM & Qadir [2016]  EWCA  Civ  1167  the  three-stage
    approach was summarised. That involves considering, first, whether  the
    Secretary of State has met the burden on her  of  identifying  evidence
    that the TOEIC certificate was obtained by  deception;  second  whether
    the claimant satisfies the evidential  burden  on  her  of  raising  an
    innocent explanation for the suggested deception;  and  third,  if  so,
    whether the Secretary of State can meet the legal burden of showing, on
    the balance of probabilities, that deception in fact took place.

42. The respondent does not argue  that  the  judge  failed  to  apply  the
    correct approach in determining the issue of whether deception had been
    used. What is asserted is that the  judge  had  reached  findings  that
    either did not take into account evidence (the lookup tool)  or  placed
    too much weight on evidence (the port interview).

43. I do not find that there is any error in the judge's assessment of  the
    evidence. It is plain from reading the decision that the judge properly
    reached  the  conclusion  at  paragraph  35  that  the  respondent  had
    discharged the initial evidential burden. It is also plain from reading
    the evidence referred to in the decision that the appellant had offered
    an innocent explanation thus the judge was  required  to  consider  the
    evidence as a whole to consider whether the respondent  discharged  the
    burden on him to demonstrate that deception  had  taken  place  on  the
    balance of probabilities.

44. Contrary to the grounds, the  judge  made  specific  reference  to  the
    lookup tool at paragraph 11 (when setting out the documentary evidence)
    and paragraph 28 where the judge summarised  that  evidence.  When  the
    judge stated that there was  no  direct  evidence  against  him  having
    cheated in his English language test, the judge was  plainly  aware  of
    the lookup tool and that whilst the source data confirmed that his test
    was deemed invalid because a proxy test had been used, and that on  the
    date in question, 53% were deemed invalid, his being one of them. I  do
    not consider that analysis when seen in the context of the findings  of
    fact and analysis  overall,  demonstrates  that  the  judge  failed  to
    properly consider the lookup tool.

45. Similarly, the  assertion  that  too  much  weight  was  given  to  the
    interview that took place in 2015 is also not justified when looking at
    the  decision  as  a  whole.  The  judge  was  plainly  aware  of   the
    respondent's contention that his fluency in English  in  2015  may  not
    necessarily reflect the position in 2012 (see paragraphs 24- 26 of  the
    decision). The judgement of MA Nigeria [2016] UKUT 450 records at [57],
    "second, we acknowledge the suggestion that the Appellant had no reason
    to engage in deception which we have found proven.  However,  this  has
    not deflected any way from reaching our main findings and  conclusions.
    In the abstract, of course, there is a range  of  reasons  why  persons
    proficient in English may engage in  TOEIC  fraud.  These  include,  in
    exhaustively, lack of confidence, fear of failure,  lack  of  time  and
    commitment and contempt for the immigration system. These reasons could
    conceivably overlap in individual cases and there is  scope  for  other
    explanations the deceitful conduct in the sphere. We are  not  required
    to make a further finding of why the Appellant engaged in deception and
    to this we add that this issue was not explored during the hearing.  We
    resist any temptation to speculate about this discrete matter."

46. The decision in MA was a statutory appeal and the evidence  before  the
    Upper Tribunal was more extensive than it had heard before  in  SM  and
    Qadir. In particular, the ETS voice files of  the  appellant  had  been
    obtained and it was agreed that the voice  was  not  his.  However,  he
    challenged whether the file was indeed a recording of the test  he  had
    taken and there was evidence from three experts exploring the issues of
    how the wrong file may have been supplied. At [47] the  Upper  Tribunal
    acknowledged  that  there  were  "enduring  unanswered  questions   and
    uncertainties relating in  particular  to  the  systems  processes  and
    procedures concerning TOEIC testing and in the subsequent allocation of
    scores in the later conduct and activities of ETS."  Accordingly,  much
    still turned on the Upper Tribunal's assessment of the appellant's oral
    evidence. They found his evidence to be  a  fabrication.  Both  parties
    have therefore emphasised that "the question of  whether  a  person  is
    engaged in fraud in procuring a  TOEIC  in  this  language  proficiency
    qualification will invariably be intrinsically fact sensitive."

47. In reaching an overall conclusion, the judge was entitled to take  into
    account the  interview  in  2015  where  the  immigration  officer  was
    satisfied that the appellant was able to answer the questions in  basic
    English and was "fluent". The  judge  recorded  "at  no  point  of  the
    interview the appellant appeared to lack credibility". It was  open  to
    the judge to reach the conclusion that the observation of  the  initial
    immigration officer was  inconsistent  with  the  subsequent  decision-
    making officers view of the apparent credibility and his  knowledge  of
    the English language (see paragraph 37).  The  judge  gave  reasons  at
    paragraph 38. Firstly, that there was a "plethora of evidence" that the
    appellant had taken language tests several times prior to 20 March 2012
    (my  emphasis).  The  judge  stated  that  the  "best  example  of  the
    appellant's exposure and level of proficiency and in this  language  is
    demonstrated by his ability at  an  interview  conducted  when  he  was
    stopped at 2.30 7 AM returning from France.  The  conditions  were  not
    been ideal  but  the  record  shows  that  he  gave  a  good  interview
    sufficient for the immigration officer to agree he  was  credible,  and
    this also came through his oral evidence before me." The judge also had
    regard to his academic achievements set out pages 46 - 47 gaining one a
    and 3B grades in his diploma English language course with an average of
    grade B. The judge was entitled to place weight on the fact that he had
    gained those results "just days before his ETS language test."

48. The judge also found that the appellant's evidence regarding  his  test
    papers during his interview  was  "indicative  as  to  his  credibility
    because at question 15 he was able to say that his papers  covered  two
    days, that he spent 20 minutes at a speaking part of his test  and  for
    60 minutes writing and also that it  took  about  90  minutes  for  the
    reading and listening papers." The judge  found  that  evidence  to  be
    significant because it was consistent with  the  objective  information
    pages 143 - 150 which he  would  not  of  had  the  knowledge  of  when
    interviewed by the immigration officer. Thus,  in  addition  to  having
    identified his previous English language ability at  a  time  that  was
    contemporaneous with the test in 2012, the  judge  found  that  he  had
    given a  credible  account  of  actually  having  taken  the  test.  At
    paragraph 38, the judge gave further reasons as to why his evidence was
    consistent with the objective material.

49. At paragraph 39, the  judge  took  into  account  his  earlier  English
    language ability as demonstrated by his IELTS and  in  particular  that
    the speaking component part of the test was his "strongest  skill"  and
    that it was not credible that he would use a proxy in an area of  skill
    in which he was the most proficient. Further qualifications in  English
    were also taken into account (in 2015 the University had  independently
    assessed him), he had gained a  City  and  Guilds  English  certificate
    showing grade B in speaking and when applying the dicta in MA (Nigeria)
    are set out above, it was open to the judge to  conclude  that  in  the
    light of his experience and ability there was no reason why  he  needed
    to cheat in his exams in March 2012.

50. The judge at paragraph 39 also took into  account  that  there  was  no
    evidence that he had ever cheated in any of his academic papers  during
    his student career. The judge therefore concluded at paragraph 42  when
    looking at the evidence "in totality" the appellant was a  student  who
    had been diligent fulfilling his  academic  achievements  and  overall,
    meeting his aim to join the family business as a  director  or  working
    for a company in Bangladesh.

51. In my judgement, the submission made on behalf of the  respondent  that
    the judge placed too much  weight  on  the  interview  in  reaching  an
    overall conclusion is not made out. In the preceding paragraphs I  have
    set out the findings of  the  judge  which  did  place  weight  on  the
    interview but also placed weight on a number  of  other  factors  which
    were relevant in reaching a decision on the evidence in its totality.

52. The final point relied upon relates to paragraph 40. Having  heard  the
    submissions of the parties, it is not entirely clear  to  me  what  the
    "interesting argument" of the previous Counsel  was.  The  judge  makes
    reference to it being stated that the test result scores relate to  135
    students which means that all 135 individuals  cheated  in  their  test
    papers. Given the numbers it is not plausible that all rooms  or  every
    individual had used a proxy. The judge then stated, "I accept that  the
    figures make the claim untenable."

53. The grounds assert that the judge was in error in finding that  because
    the objective evidence from the project fa�ade report demonstrated that
    the results at Elizabeth College were at odds with genuine colleges and
    that  the  comment  also  was  contrary  to  Lord  Justice  Underhill's
    characterisation of Elizabeth College as a "fraud factory".

54.  However,  whilst  the  evidence  made  reference  to  135  tests  been
    cancelled, they were not all said to  be  invalid-71  was  said  to  be
    invalid  and  the  rest  were  questionable.  It  therefore  does   not
    demonstrate that all 135 individuals cheated or used a proxy. I do  not
    think that that finding, if it is one, assists either party.

55. Furthermore, the grounds seek to  rely  on  the  observations  of  Lord
    Justice Underhill at paragraph 33 but fail to  make  reference  to  the
    remainder of that paragraph. In this context I  remind  myself  of  the
    words of Lord Justice Underhill in Ahsan (as cited) at paragraph 33 and
    that although it seems clear that deception took place on a wide  scale
    it does not follow that every  person  who  took  the  TOEIC  test  was
    engaging in deception.

56. The judge  therefore  concluded  that  the  evidential  burden  on  the
    Respondent had not been discharged. Given the evidence that I have  set
    out above, that was a decision that was open to  the  judge  to  reach.
    Having considered the evidence that was before the Tribunal and in  the
    light of the grounds I am not satisfied that the judge erred in law  in
    reaching that decision.

57. Consequently, the appeal of the Secretary of State is dismissed on  the
    grounds relating to that part of the decision. I do not set aside those
    findings of fact; they are findings properly open to the judge to  make
    and I accept Mr Spurling's submission that they should be preserved  on
    that issue and that the issue of deception  is  now  settled  by  those
    findings.

58. As set out in the preceding paragraphs, Mr Spurling submitted that  the
    Tribunal should remit the appeal to the  FtTJ  only  on  the  issue  of
    Article 8 (see his skeleton  argument).  Mr  Clarke  agreed  with  that
    disposal. Given that that is the only issue, and that the  findings  on
    the deception issue have not been  made  out  and  are  preserved,  the
    parties also agreed that the appeal should be put before  Judge  Lingam
    to consider any further evidence or submissions relating to Article  8.
    I note that at paragraph 45 the judge made reference to the argument of
    the appellant being returned to the position that he  would  have  been
    had his cancellation of leave not occurred. Neither advocate  made  any
    submissions on this point. The parties will therefore  be  expected  to
    provide submissions on this alongside the Article 8 claim.





Decision:

The appeal of the Secretary  of  State  against  the  decision  of  the  FtT
relating to the issue of deception (Paragraph 321 (A)  is  dismissed;  there
is no error of law demonstrated for the reasons set out above.

The appeal is remitted to the FtT (Judge Lingam) to  complete  the  decision
on human rights grounds (Article 8).
