                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW

1.   The appellant has lodged an application for  permission  to  appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal against the determination of  FtTJ  O'Rourke,  which
    was promulgated on 15 October 2015.

2.   The appellant's application only challenges  the  judge's  decision  on
    the Article 8 appeal.

3.   However, the judge's conclusions at paragraphs 24 and 25 in respect  of
    the asylum claim disclose an error of law, which  is  material  to  the
    decision.  The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria.  The judge materially
    erred in law when he considered risk on return  to  Iraq,  his  finding
    that the appellant is a Kurd and can therefore locate  himself  in  the
    KRG area and that Article 15(c) is not engaged by returning him to  the
    KRG.

4.   These findings clearly show that the judge did not apply  his  mind  to
    the facts that were before him.

5.   In the absence  of  any  submissions  from  either  party  to  my  Case
    Management Directions dated 17 December 2015, I have decided  to  remit
    the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for  re-hearing  by  a  different
    judge.
