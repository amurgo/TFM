                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Babarande, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms K Pal, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 26th November 1979.   The
    Appellant applied for entry clearance as a partner under Appendix FM of
    the  Immigration  Rules  and  her  application  was  considered   under
    paragraph  EC-P.1  of  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   Her
    application  was  refused  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  on  18th
    September 2013.

 2. The Appellant appealed and the appeal came before Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Bird sitting at Taylor House on 20th October 2014.  In  a
    determination promulgated on 20th October 2014 the appeal  was  allowed
    under the Immigration Rules.

 3. On 27th October 2014 the Secretary of State lodged Grounds of Appeal to
    the Upper  Tribunal.   On  29th  December  2014  Designated  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Macdonald granted permission to appeal.  Judge Macdonald
    noted that the grounds of application stated that the judge should  not
    have been satisfied that the terms of Appendix FM-SE had been met.   In
    particular it was contended that there were wage slips missing and  the
    English language requirement was not met.  Judge  Macdonald  considered
    that it was arguable that the judge had erred in law in favour  of  the
    Appellant in terms of the Rules given  that  there  were  a  number  of
    payslips missing and that it was arguable that the  Appellant  did  not
    satisfy the test in respect of the English  language  requirement.   No
    Rule  24  response  appears  to  have  been  filed  or  served  by  the
    Appellant's solicitors.  It is on that  basis  that  the  appeal  comes
    before me to determine whether or not there is a material error of  law
    in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  This is an appeal  by  the
    Secretary of State.  For the purpose of continuity throughout the legal
    proceedings the Secretary  of  State  is  referred  to  herein  as  the
    Respondent and Ms Omotoso as the Appellant.  The Appellant  appears  by
    her instructed Counsel Mr Babarande.  Mr  Babarande  is  familiar  with
    this matter  having  appeared  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The
    Secretary of State appears by her Home  Office  Presenting  Officer  Ms
    Pal.

The History of the Matter

 4. The history of this matter is not in dispute.  It was accepted that the
    Appellant had initially made an application to  join  her  husband  for
    settlement in March 2012 and that that application had been  considered
    by an Entry Clearance Officer under paragraph 281 of HC 395 (being  the
    Immigration Rules that were then in operation).  That  application  had
    been refused and a further application was submitted on 28th  September
    2012 under the new and current Immigration Rules.  That application was
    refused on the basis that the Appellant had failed to show her  Sponsor
    met the financial requirements  under  Appendix  FM  and  that  it  was
    decided that she had failed  to  provide  evidence  that  she  met  the
    English language requirement.  As a  result  a  third  application  was
    submitted by the Appellant on 31st May 2013.  It was  that  application
    that was allowed on appeal by Judge Bird.

Submissions/Discussion

 5. Ms Pal indicates that the Secretary of State relied on the  Grounds  of
    Appeal and  that  the  First-tier  Judge  has  recorded  the  financial
    requirements and notes the need to provide the  specified  evidence  in
    support of any assertion that  the  Sponsor  meets  the  annual  income
    threshold  of  ï¿½18,600.   The  specific  issue  in  contention  is  the
    requirement for wage slips to be  provided  covering  six  months.   He
    points out that the First-tier Tribunal Judge has noted that some  wage
    slips are missing but considers that their absence is mitigated by bank
    statements which show that  the  payments  have  been  going  into  the
    Sponsor's account for the dates that are not covered by  the  payslips.
    She submits therefore that the Rule has not been met by  the  Appellant
    and that the determination as a result displays  a  material  error  of
    law.

 6. So far as the English language  certificate  is  concerned  it  is  not
    disputed that the Appellant has a degree which is recognised  and  that
    she was taught in English but it  is  contended  that  the  educational
    qualification is post decision and the correct approach  would  be  for
    the Appellant to make a  fresh  application  setting  out  her  English
    language test results.  She acknowledges that  this  requirement  would
    have been met had the test results  been  before  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer.  She asked me to set aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and to remake the decision refusing the  Appellant's  original
    application.

 7. Mr Babarande points out that the Entry Clearance Manager was in receipt
    of the English test results and has noted that the Appellant has passed
    the English language test requirements.  Whilst acknowledging  that  it
    is best to undertake the test in order to comply  with  the  Rules  and
    that the Appellant did not have the relevant certificate, at  the  time
    of the hearing it was  clear  that  the  Appellant  obviously  met  the
    English language requirement.  She now has  a  degree  and  has  passed
    English language with a high score of 6.5.  He submits that  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer was consequently wrong in refusing the  Appellant  on
    this particular ground.

 8. So far as the financial position is concerned firstly he refers  me  to
    the missing payslips that are now produced  but  points  out  that  the
    payslips are just evidential of the financial circumstances and that it
    was appropriate to apply evidential flexibility which was the  approach
    adopted by the judge.  He takes me to the P60s that have been  provided
    by the Sponsor and the bank  statements  and  that  they  showed  quite
    clearly that the financial requirements were met.   He  indicates  that
    there is no material error of law  and  he  asked  me  to  dismiss  the
    Secretary of State's appeal.

The Law

 9.  Areas  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account  immaterial   considerations,
    reaching irrational conclusions  on  fact  or  evaluation  or  to  give
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

10. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged.  Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail to
    deal with every  factual  issue  of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story is untrue.  If  a  point  of
    evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is  a
    failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings

11. The challenge by  the  Secretary  of  State  was  that  the  judge  has
    materially erred in law in failing to conclude that the  Appellant  met
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules both by way of the  financial
    gross annual  income  of  the  Sponsor  and  by  failing  to  have  the
    appropriate English language test certificate.  These issues have  been
    fully addressed at paragraphs 16  to  21  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge's determination.  At paragraph 16 the judge has acknowledged  the
    financial  requirement  and  has  examined  the  documentary   evidence
    produced which has consisted of P60s, wage slips,  a  letter  from  the
    Sponsor's  employer  who  issued  the  wage  slips  and  personal  bank
    statements corresponding to the period  of  the  wage  slips.   He  has
    acknowledged that there were four missing payslips respectively for the
    weeks 1st, 8th, 15th and 22nd February  2013.   However  despite  this,
    applying evidential flexibility, he has shown that he is satisfied that
    documentary evidence particularly from the P60s and bank statements has
    been provided to show that the Sponsor meets the requirements necessary
    for the Appellant's appeal as to his income over the relevant six month
    period.  In addition to that the missing wage slips are made  available
    to me today.

12. I am satisfied that whilst there may have been an error of  law  it  is
    not material.  There is clear evidence that the Appellant  through  her
    Sponsor met the financial requirements and the judge has not  erred  in
    law in his  approach.   He  has  given  careful  consideration  to  the
    documents produced evidencing them at paragraphs 17 and 18 and  on  the
    balance of probabilities has made findings which  he  was  entitled  to
    that the Appellant met the financial requirements.

13. At paragraphs 20 and  21  the  judge  has  considered  the  refusal  in
    relation  to  the  English  language  requirements  as  required  under
    paragraph E-ECP.4.2 namely that the Appellant has to show that she  has
    the required English language  certificate.   He  has  noted  that  the
    Appellant was able to provide evidence  of  her  qualification  from  a
    university in Nigeria and that subsequently she has sat and passed  the
    relevant English language test.  The judge found that the evidence from
    the university which was  before  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  on  a
    balance of probabilities showed that the Appellant had a BA degree  and
    should therefore have been exempt from the requirement  to  produce  an
    English language certificate.  When taken together the subsequent  test
    certificate and the document from the university showed to him that the
    Appellant met the English language requirement under Appendix FM.  This
    is a finding that I am satisfied the judge was entitled to make and did
    not disclose any material error  of  law.   In  order  to  succeed  the
    Secretary of State would have to show that there has  been  a  material
    error of law.  The judge was perfectly entitled to make the findings of
    fact that he did and the fact remains that this is an  Appellant  whose
    Sponsor meets the financial requirements and an Appellant who satisfies
    the English language  requirements.   To  suggest  that  the  Appellant
    should go away and make a fresh application is an unnecessary and  over
    burdensome approach.  Any error of law is not material and the  outcome
    on any analysis would be that this Appellant meets the requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules.  In such circumstances I find that the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal discloses no material error of law  and  the
    appeal of the Secretary of State is dismissed and the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal is maintained.
