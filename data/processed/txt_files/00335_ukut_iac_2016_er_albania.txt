For the Respondent:    Mr P Nathan, Counsel, instructed by J McCarthy
Solicitors

The purpose and intention of Parliament in  incorporating  section  117C  of
the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 was to ensure that  all  of
the criminal convictions providing a reason  for  the  deportation  decision
are to be examined within the framework provided by that section.

What is required when undertaking the exercise required by sections  117C(1)
to (6) is careful scrutiny  of  those  offences  which  are  on  a  person's
criminal record which have provided a reason for the decision to deport.

The IDIs do not fully reflect section 117C(7) in that it is not  necessarily
the case that, once a foreign criminal has been convicted and  sentenced  to
more than four  years'  imprisonment,  he  will  never  be  eligible  to  be
considered under the Exceptions.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Facts

1.    For  the  purposes  of  this  determination  we  propose  to  use  the
    nomenclature  of  the  parties  as  they  were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal: Mr Rexha is referred to as the appellant and the Secretary of
    State for the Home  Department  the  respondent.  The  appellant  is  a
    national of Albania who was born on 22 January 1979.  He arrived in the
    United Kingdom on 26 May  1996  and  claimed  asylum  following  which,
    whilst his application was refused, he was granted exceptional leave to
    remain until 21 September  1997.  Thereafter  he  was  granted  further
    limited leave to remain until 25 February 2002.

2.    On 11 January 2002 the appellant was convicted at Harrow  Crown  Court
    of possession with intent to supply of 188  Kg  of  cannabis.   He  was
    sentenced to four years' imprisonment.  A notice of decision to make  a
    deportation order was served on the appellant on 23  May  2003  and  he
    appealed against that decision. The Adjudicator who heard  his  appeal,
    Mr Bailey, allowed his appeal in  a  determination  promulgated  on  22
    November 2004.  He summarised his conclusions as follows:

         "Having viewed the appellant's case a whole and having  taken  into
         account the factors as set out in paragraph 364 in my  judgement  I
         consider that the appellant has provided a credible basis for me to
         find that the Secretary of  State  has  misused  his  discretionary
         powers in issuing a deportation order. Whilst  I  acknowledge  that
         offence was a serious one there are the other factors that need  to
         be put into the balance.  Mr Evans in the bundle  of  case  law  he
         referred me to argued that those cases  established  the  principle
         that the fact that the appellant was unlikely to reoffend  was  not
         in  itself to counter balance the seriousness  of an  office  which
         may be sufficient in itself to merit  deportation.   The  cases  in
         issue did involve  offences  for  which  the  appellants  had  been
         convicted for longer period than the appellant. In my judgement the
         offence is not so weighty  in  itself  as  to  nullify  with  other
         factors appertaining to the appellant's  case.  The  appellant  has
         shown contrition and there is every reason to conclude as evidenced
         by the appellant's behaviour since his  release  from  prison  that
         reoffending is unlikely.  Indeed with such a lapse of time since he
         was discharged it is reasonable  to  conclude  that  the  appellant
         cannot  be  regarded  as  an  ongoing  risk  to  the  public.   The
         appellant's case has to  be  put  in  the  context  of  his  family
         circumstances which I have referred  to  above  in  particular  the
         position vis-�-vis his two children.  My own conclusions  are  that
         the appellant's appeal should succeed and that a deportation  under
         paragraph 364 of the Immigration Rules was not justified in all the
         circumstances of the appellant's case. In those circumstances it is
         unnecessary for me to consider the appellant's claim under  Article
         8 of the Human Rights Act 1998."

3.    There was an appeal against Mr Bailey's decision which  was  dismissed
    on 20 March 2006.  Thereafter he was  granted  discretionary  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom until 8 March 2008.  On 25  February  2008
    he applied for indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom on  the
    basis that he had been here for ten years. That application was refused
    and he subsequently successfully appealed the refusal, the appeal being
    allowed on 3 July 2008.  He was then  granted  discretionary  leave  to
    remain until 31 July 2011.

4.    On 13 July 2010  the  appellant  was  convicted  at  the  West  London
    Magistrates' Court of possession of a Class A controlled  drug,  namely
    cocaine, and he was given a conditional discharge  of  eighteen  months
    together with a requirement to pay costs in the sum of �85.

5.    In 2011 the Italian authorities sought to extradite the  appellant  on
    the basis that he had committed an offence in Italy in  2002  and  been
    sentenced in his absence to ten years'  imprisonment.    Eventually  he
    was handed over to the Italian authorities on 23 November 2012.

6.    On 26 February 2013 the  Italian  court  quashed  his  conviction  and
    granted him the right to reopen his case.  He was  then  released  from
    detention in Italy and those criminal proceedings  remain  outstanding.
    Following his release from detention he applied for entry clearance  to
    return to the UK but that application was refused.  His judicial review
    in relation to  that  application  was  also  refused.   Ultimately  he
    entered the United Kingdom  illegally  on  2  June  2013  and  made  an
    application for discretionary leave to  remain  on  7  June  2013.   No
    decision was reached on that application prior to the respondent  being
    provided with a  decision  giving  notice  of  a  decision  to  make  a
    deportation order against him on 15 January 2015.  In response to  that
    decision  further  representations  were  made   to   the   respondent.
    Ultimately on 6 March 2015  the  respondent  rejected  the  appellant's
    human rights claim and decided that the appellant  should  be  deported
    from the United Kingdom.

7.    The decision of  6  March  2015  covered  a  number  of  grounds.   In
    particular paragraphs 18  to  23  addressed  the  appellant's  criminal
    history.   It noted what has been set out above in  relation  to  facts
    surrounding his convictions in  2002  and  2010.    The  decision  then
    observed as follows:

         "23. Although, this conviction did not lead to a further  custodial
             sentence, it is considered that you have demonstrated a  clear
             disregard for the laws of the UK and despite being fully aware
             that your criminality in the UK would  leave  you  liable  for
             deportation, you have continued to offend. In light of all  of
             the above, it is  considered  that  the  seriousness  of  your
             criminality is enough to warrant  your  deportation  from  the
             UK."

8.    The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and the  appeal  was
    heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Bird  on  1  September  2015.
    She allowed the appeal.  An issue arose in the context of the appeal as
    to whether or  not  the  respondent  was  entitled  to  rely  upon  the
    appellant's conviction in 2002.  It is the judge's resolution  of  this
    issue,  which  had  consequential  impact  upon  her  approach  to  the
    application of the Immigration Rules which is the  principle  basis  of
    this appeal. She explained her conclusions as follows:

         "31. The Secretary of State relies on sub-section (6)  [of  Section
             117C] in stating that the appellant has failed  to  show  that
             there are very compelling circumstances to  prevent  any  such
             deportation and relies on the appellant's conviction in  2003.
             The Secretary of State also relies on  the  pending  trial  in
             Italy. The  most  recent  offence  which  gave  rise  to  this
             decision is mentioned at  paragraph  22  of  the  Reasons  for
             Refusal Letter for which the appellant was given a conditional
             discharge of eighteen months. The appellant has not  committed
             any offences since then.

         32.      It is my view that the application  of  sub-Section  6  in
             these circumstances is misconceived and not in accordance with
             the spirit of Section 117C.  The last offence  for  which  the
             appellant was convicted  was  in  2010  and  he  was  given  a
             conditional discharge. He was not sentenced on  that  occasion
             to a period of imprisonment of at least  four  years  (Section
             117C(6)).  Of relevance is Section 117C(7) which states:

                  'The considerations in sub-sections (1) to (6) are  to  be
                  taken  into  account  where  a  court   or   Tribunal   is
                  considering a decision to deport a foreign  criminal  only
                  to the extent that the reason for  the  decision  was  the
                  offence or  offences  for  which  the  criminal  has  been
                  convicted.'

         33.      I find that what gives rise to  the  decision  to  make  a
             deportation order on conducive grounds is  the  offence  which
             was committed in 2010  for  which  the  appellant  received  a
             conditional discharge. This  sub-section  is  phrased  in  the
             present tense 'for which the  appellant  has  been  convicted'
             [emphasis mine] not was convicted in the past -  if  that  had
             been the intention of Parliament it would have  been  included
             in the subsection.  Of  course  this  does  not  detract  from
             considering deportation to be in the public interest where the
             appellant    is     a     persistent     offender     (Section
             117D(2)(c)(iii)))."

9.    On this basis, therefore, the  judge  proceeded  to  engage  with  the
    merits of the appeal reliant on the most recent 2010 conviction and not
    applying Section 117C (6) as set  out  below  and  considering  whether
    there  were  "very  compelling  circumstances"  over  and   above   the
    exceptions provided within the Section so as to justify the  conclusion
    that deportation was not required.  In her construction of Section 117C
    it is contended on behalf of the respondent that the  judge  fell  into
    error and therefore that the decision cannot stand.

The Law

10.   The decision reached by  the  respondent  to  refuse  the  appellant's
    human rights claim gave rise to his right of  appeal  to  the  Tribunal
    under Section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002.
    The Immigration Act 2014 incorporated changes within  part  VA  of  the
    2002 Act in relation to Article 8 of the ECHR and the consideration  of
    the public interest.  In particular, in relation to this  case  Section
    117C  incorporated  a  section   specifically   addressing   additional
    considerations required to be taken into account in  respect  of  cases
    involving foreign criminals.  Section 117C provides as follows:

         "117C Article  8:  Additional  considerations  in  cases  involving
             foreign criminals


             (1) The deportation of foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
                  interest.


             (2) The more  serious  the  offence  committed  by  a  foreign
                  criminal,  the  greater  is   the   public   interest   in
                  deportation of the criminal.


             (3) In the  case of a foreign criminal (C) who  has  not  been
                  sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of  four  years  or
                  more, the public interest requires C's deportation  unless
                  Exception  1 or Exception 2 applies.


             (4) Exception 1 applies where -


                  (a)  C has been lawfully resident in  the  United  Kingdom
                      for most of C's life
                  (b)  C is socially and culturally integrated in the United
                      Kingdom, and
                  (c)  there would be  very  significant  obstacles  to  C's
                      integration into the country to which C  is  proposed
                      to be deported.


             (5) Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine  and  subsisting
                  relationship with a qualifying partner, or a  genuine  and
                  subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying  child,
                  and the effect of C's deportation on the partner or  child
                  would be unduly harsh.


             (6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has  been  sentenced
                  to a period of imprisonment of at least  four  years,  the
                  public interest requires deportation unless there are very
                  compelling circumstances, over and above  those  described
                  in Exceptions 1 and 2.


             (7) The considerations in sub-sections (1), (2), (6) are to be
                  taken  into  account  where  a  court   or   Tribunal   is
                  considering a decision to deport a  foreign  criminal  was
                  only to the extent that the reason for  the  decision  was
                  the offence or offences for which the  criminal  has  been
                  convicted."

11.   A "foreign criminal" is defined for the purposes of this Part  of  the
    Act in Section 117D(2) as follows:

         "117D


          (2)   In this Part, 'foreign criminal' means a person-


             (a) who is not a British citizen,


             (b) who has  been  convicted  in  the  United  Kingdom  of  an
                  offence, and


                  (c)  who-


                  (i)  has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of  at
                      least 12 months,


                  (ii) has been convicted of  an  offence  that  has  caused
                      serious harm, or


                  (iii)      is a persistent offender."


12.   Neither party were  able  to  draw  to  our  attention  any  authority
    bearing upon the proper construction of in particular  Section  117C(6)
    and (7). Since the conclusion  of  the  hearing  the  case  of  Johnson
    (deportation-4 years imprisonment) [2016] UKUT 00282 has been  reported
    and we note, that although principally concerned with  the  Immigration
    Rules, and in particular paragraph 398 of the  Rules,  the  conclusions
    reached are consonant with the conclusions set out below.

13.   Mr Phillip Nathan, who appeared on behalf  of  the  appellant,  placed
    reliance upon the principles set out by Stanley Burnton LJ in the  case
    of Secretary of State for the Home Department  v  TB  (Jamaica)  [2008]
    EWCA Civ 977.  In that case the issue which arose was the status of  an
    earlier decision of an  Immigration  Judge  in  a  person's  case  when
    considering a  subsequent  application.  Mr  Nathan  relied  upon  this
    authority in relation to submissions he made in respect of  the  status
    of the earlier determination of the Adjudicator in 2004 set out  below.
    The relevant paragraphs of Stanley Burnton LJ's  judgment  (which  were
    adopted and applied by this Tribunal in the case of  Chomanga  (Binding
    effect of unappealed decisions) Zimbabwe [2011] UKUT 00312 (IAC))  were
    as follows:

         "32.     As a matter of principle, it cannot be right for the  Home
             Secretary to be able to circumvent the decision of the IAT  by
             administrative decision. If she could  do  so,  the  statutory
             appeal system would be undermined; indeed, in a case  such  as
             the present, the decision of  the  Immigration  Judge  on  the
             application  of  the  Refugee   Convention   would   be   made
             irrelevant. That would  be  inconsistent  with  the  statutory
             scheme.


         33.      The principle that the decision of the Tribunal is binding
             on the parties, and in particular on the Home  Secretary,  has
             been consistently upheld by the Courts. In R (Mersin)  v  Home
             Secretary [2000] EWHC Admin 348, Elias J said:


                  "In my opinion there is a clear duty on the  Secretary  of
                  State  to  give  effect  to  the   Special   Adjudicator's
                  decision. Even if he can refuse to do so in the  event  of
                  changed circumstances or because there is another  country
                  to which the applicant can be sent, there is still a  duty
                  unless and until that situation arises.  It  would  wholly
                  undermine the rule of law if he could  simply  ignore  the
                  ruling of the Special Adjudicator  without  appealing  it,
                  and indeed Mr. Catchpole [counsel for the Home  Secretary]
                  does not suggest that he can. Nor in my opinion  could  he
                  deliberately delay giving effect to the ruling in the hope
                  that something might turn up to justify  not  implementing
                  it. In my judgment, once the  adjudicator  had  determined
                  the application in the applicant's favour,  the  applicant
                  had a right to be granted refugee status, at least  unless
                  and until there was a change in the position."

         34.      In R (Boafo) v Home Secretary [2002] EWCA  Civ,  [2002]  1
             WLR 44, Auld LJ said at [26] in  a  judgment  with  which  the
             other  members  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  agreed,  '...   an
             unappealed decision  of  an  adjudicator  is  binding  on  the
             parties.' In R (Saribal) v Home  Secretary  [2002]  EWHC  1542
             (Admin), [2002] INLR 596, Moses J said:


             "17.      The decision  in  ex  parte  Boafo  demonstrates  an
                  important principle at the heart of these proceedings. The
                  Secretary of  State  is  not  entitled  to  disregard  the
                  determination of the IAT and refuse a claimant's right  to
                  indefinite leave to remain as a refugee unless he can  set
                  aside that determination by appropriate procedure  founded
                  on appropriate evidence."


         35.      Of course, different considerations may apply where  there
             is relevant fresh evidence that was not available at the  date
             of the hearing, or a change in the law, and the principle  has
             no application where there is a  change  in  circumstances  or
             there are new events after the date of the decision: see  Auld
             LJ in Boafo at [28]. But this is not such a case."

Conclusions

14.   In our judgment the expression "has been convicted" in the context  of
    Section 117C(6) and (7) does not limit the application of that  Section
    to solely the conviction immediately prior to and prompting the  making
    of a decision to deport.  Whilst it may be  said  that  the  phrase  is
    expressed in the present perfect tense, we can see  little  sense  when
    examining the public interest identified in Section 117C(1) and (2)  to
    limiting the application of these provisions designed  to  protect  the
    public interest to solely the most recent episode of criminal behaviour
    by a foreign criminal. We are satisfied that the purpose and  intention
    of Parliament in incorporating this section  providing  for  additional
    considerations and specific  treatment  of  foreign  criminals  was  to
    ensure that all of the criminal convictions providing a reason for  the
    deportation decision were to be examined within the framework  provided
    by Section 117C.

15.   We see no reason  for  construing  Section  117C(7)  as  limiting  the
    considerations relevant to sub-Sections (1) to (6) to solely  the  most
    recent offence or offences for which the  person  has  been  convicted.
    Firstly, that is not what the Section expressly says. It does  not  say
    in Section 117C(7) that only the offence or offences immediately  prior
    to the deportation decision are the be taken  into  account.  Secondly,
    the use of the phrase "only to the  extent  that  the  reason  for  the
    decision was the offence or offences for which the  criminal  has  been
    convicted"  expressly  requires  an  examination  of  the  decision  to
    identify which parts of the criminal's antecedent history  provide  the
    basis for the decision. It will be  a  matter  for  the  respondent  to
    decide in each case  which  parts  of  a  candidate  for  deportation's
    criminal past is to be relied upon  in  support  of  the  making  of  a
    deportation order.  It may well be that in the vast majority  of  cases
    the totality of the criminal offending will provide the reason for  the
    decision.  Equally, there may be  cases  where  some  of  the  person's
    criminal past could not properly be relied upon. This could occur,  for
    instance, because of their youth  at  the  time  of  the  offending  or
    because of the passage of a significant period of time, or because  the
    offending was rooted in beliefs or circumstances now  quite  irrelevant
    to the justification for a deportation order being made.  Thus, in  our
    view what is required is careful scrutiny pursuant to  Section  117C(7)
    of those offences which are on the person's criminal record which  have
    provided a reason for the decision to deport.  All of those convictions
    are then relevant to  undertaking  the  exercise  required  by  Section
    117C(1) to (6).

16.   Applying that construction to the  present  case  gives  rise  to  the
    following consequences. Firstly, we  are  satisfied  that  the  judge's
    construction  of  Section  117C  in  paragraphs  32  and  33   of   her
    determination  were  in  error  and  the  determination  cannot  stand.
    Secondly, when the decision of 6  March  2015  is  scrutinised  and  in
    particular paragraph 23, it is clear that those offences which formed a
    reason for the decision to deport included both the 2002 and  the  2010
    conviction.  Thus the respondent was  entitled  to  rely  upon  Section
    117C(6) as the foreign criminal in this case had been sentenced  to   a
    period of four years in relation to an offence which  formed  a  reason
    for the decision.  As set  out  above,  the  judge  did  not  consider,
    because of her approach to Section 117C, whether there were  any  "very
    compelling circumstances over and above those described in Exceptions 1
    and 2" in the appellant's case.

17.    Mr  Nathan  submitted  that  the  decision  could    nonetheless   be
    effectively  upheld  on  the  basis  that  not   only   was   there   a
    misunderstanding in the decision reached that Mr Bailey had  based  his
    decision on Article 8 (which he had not) but also that as a consequence
    of the findings in paragraph 8.4 of his determination  set  out  above,
    the respondent was not entitled to rely upon the 2002 conviction as  Mr
    Bailey had found that it was not properly a justification as it did not
    properly found a conclusion that the deportation of  the  appellant  in
    this case was not conducive to the public good.   As a  result  of  the
    decision in TB (Jamaica) the respondent was fixed with  the  conclusion
    of Mr Bailey that that offence did not justify deportation and  it  was
    not therefore open for the respondent to rely upon that  conviction  in
    paragraph 23 of the decision of 6 March 2015.

18.   We are unable to accept that submission.  It appears clear to us  that
    the exceptions identified in paragraph 35 of TB  (Jamaica)  applied  in
    this case.  Not only have the factual circumstances of the  appellant's
    case  moved  on  considerably  since  the  point  in  time  when   that
    determination was  reached  in  excess  of  ten  years  prior  to  this
    decision, but also there had been a  change  in  the  law  through  the
    introduction of the provisions in the Immigration Act 2014 which are at
    the heart of this appeal.  Whilst in our view it was necessary for  the
    respondent to give consideration to which of the  offences  within  the
    appellant's criminal past were relied upon as reasons for the  decision
    to deport him, the respondent was not, in the circumstances,  precluded
    by Mr Bailey's findings from relying upon the 2002 conviction  as  part
    of the overall appraisal of the appropriateness of deportation  in  his
    case.

19.   We note that in the respondent's grounds reliance is placed  upon  the
    respondent's  Immigration  Directorate  Instructions  -   Chapter   13:
    Criminality Guidance in Article 8 ECHR cases.  It is of course  obvious
    to observe firstly, that these Instructions were not placed before  the
    judge and therefore it could not sensibly be regarded as a criticism of
    her that she did  not take them into account.  Secondly, they cannot be
    determinative of  the  correct  construction  of  Section  117C.   They
    provide as follows:

         "2.2.2 Once a foreign criminal has been sentenced to a period of at
             least four years' imprisonment, he will never be  eligible  to
             be considered under  the  exceptions.  This  applies  even  if
             deportation was not pursued at the time  of  the  four  years'
             sentence because there were very compelling circumstances such
             that deportation  would have been  disproportionate,  and  the
             foreign criminal goes on to reoffend and  is  sentenced  to  a
             period of imprisonment  of  less  than  four  years.  This  is
             because his deportation will continue to be conducive  to  the
             pubic good and in  the  public  interest  for  the  four  year
             sentence as well as any subsequent sentences."

20.   The contents of the IDI have had no bearing  on  the  construction  of
    Section 117C that we have arrived  at  above.   We  note  that  broadly
    speaking it reflects our interpretation of the meaning of that  section
    to some extent.  It is  not,  however,  entirely  consistent  with  the
    interpretation since, for the reasons we have set out above, it is  not
    necessarily the case that once a foreign criminal  has  been  convicted
    and sentenced to more than four years' imprisonment that he will  never
    be eligible to be considered under the Exceptions.   The  Secretary  of
    State in reaching her decision on deportation may  conclude  that  that
    conviction and sentence should not  properly  form  a  reason  for  the
    decision to deport (for instance, for the  reasons  which  we  set  out
    above).  In the light of  the  provisions  of  Section  117C  (7)  that
    conviction would then not form part of the exercise required by Section
    117C (1) to (6).  Since the IDI was drawn to our attention we  felt  it
    appropriate to make this observation.


Disposal

21.    Mr Nathan submitted  with  some  force  that  there  were  sufficient
    factual findings in the judge's determination to justify the conclusion
    that in any event very compelling circumstances  were  demonstrated  in
    the appellant's case and that the Tribunal could uphold the Immigration
    Judge's decision notwithstanding any error that might be  found  as  to
    the interpretation of Section 117C.

22.   We recognise the strength of the points which he makes in relation  to
    the uncertainties that remitting the matter would  involve  not  simply
    for the appellant but more particularly  for  his  family.   Those  are
    issues which are clearly of  concern.   Nonetheless,  and  not  without
    some hesitation, we have concluded that it is not  possible  some  time
    after the judge's decision was reached and in circumstances  where  she
    made  no  direct  findings  in  respect  of  whether  very   compelling
    circumstances have been demonstrated to reach our  own  conclusions  on
    those points. We are satisfied that the appropriate form of disposal is
    for this matter to be remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  the
    decision to be re-made by a Judge of the First-tier Tribunal other than
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Bird.

Decision

23.   The appeal is allowed and the decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Bird dated 16 September 2015 is quashed.

24.   This matter is to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for it to re-
    make the decision pursuant to Section 12(2)(b)(ii)  of  the  Tribunals,
    Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, by a Judge of the  First-Tier-Tribunal
    other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Bird.

25.   No anonymity direction is made.
