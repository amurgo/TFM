For the Appellant:     Ms MC Benitee (Hayat & Co Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mrs Monica Tanner (Home Office Presenting Officer)

1. There can be no doubt  as  to  the  willingness  of  the  authorities  in
Trinidad and Tobago to  operate  an  effective  system  for  the  detection,
prosecution and punishment of acts constituting persecution or serious  harm
of its citizens.

2. However, given the current crisis in the policing  and  criminal  justice
system, in general, even persons who are witnesses  or  potential  witnesses
in trials involving serious organised crimes,  will  not  receive  effective
protection either in the short or longer term, whether or not admitted to  a
witness protection programme.

3. For persons facing a real risk of being persecuted and/or  other  serious
harm at the hands of Jaamat al  Muslimeen  (JAM),  the  state  is  currently
unable to afford effective protection.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. On 8 March 2010 the Court of Appeal, on  appeal  from  the  Asylum  and
    Immigration Tribunal, ordered by consent that  the  appellant's  appeal
    against the determination of the AIT  promulgated  on  26  March  2009,
    dismissing the appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision  of
    13 April 2004 to remove him to Trinidad and Tobago be allowed, that the
    determination be set aside and that the case be remitted to  the  Upper
    Tribunal for a second  stage  reconsideration.   The  Court  of  Appeal
    directed that the determination of the Upper  Tribunal  be  limited  to
    determining:

           a. Whether the authorities of Trinidad and  Tobago  can  provide
              sufficient protection to the appellant and
           b. Whether the authorities can take reasonable steps to  prevent
              the persecution or suffering of serious harm by operating  an
              effective legal system for  the  detection,  prosecution  and
              punishment of acts constituting persecution or  serious  harm
              in relation to the appellant and his claims at being at  risk
              of persecution from non-state actors in Trinidad and Tobago.


    It further directed that the findings of fact made by Immigration Judge
    Talbot were to stand.


 2. Mindful of the strict limitation of the scope of  the  appeal  that  is
    before us as set out in the order of the Court of Appeal when remitting
    the matter to us, we have not considered it appropriate to  raise,  for
    the very first time, of our  own  volition,  the  matter  of  potential
    exclusion of the appellant from surrogate protection at this late stage
    in the proceedings. We note the nature of the appellant's claim and his
    history, as well as the fact that his unsuccessful claim to  asylum  in
    the UK was made in 2004, his appeal against  that  decision  dismissed,
    but his subsequent appeal to the Court of  Appeal  was  successful  and
    that his case now comes before us in 2010  without  there  ever  having
    been any question raised at any  stage  as  to  whether  he  should  be
    excluded from surrogate international protection. We have proceeded  on
    the basis that  this  was  because  he  has  always  claimed  that  his
    involvement with JAM was not voluntary  and  because  he  left  JAM  in
    difficult circumstances at a key moment in the course of the 1990 coup.
    We summarise below the appellant's case and the  findings  of  fact  of
    Immigration Judge Talbot.

 3. The appellant, whose stated date of birth is 3  November  1964,  sought
    asylum on 3 April 2004, claiming that he was a national of Trinidad and
    Tobago and that he had arrived in the United  Kingdom  on  21  December
    2002.  His claim to asylum was made on the basis that in  1987  he  had
    been forced to become a member of the Muslim group Jaamat al  Muslimeen
    (JAM), and that he feared persecution and ill treatment from members of
    JAM having disobeyed the orders of their  leader,  Yasin  Abu  Bakr  to
    assist in the attempted coup mounted by JAM against the  government  of
    Trinidad and Tobago in July 1990.  Following  the  attempted  coup  the
    appellant fled to the USA arriving in New York in November 1990.  About
    a year after his arrival he applied for asylum  in  the  USA;  but  the
    application  did  not  proceed  to  a  final  determination,  and   was
    eventually withdrawn by him before his return to Trinidad and Tobago in
    March 2000.  He then remained in Trinidad  and  Tobago  for  two  years
    before travelling to the United Kingdom.


 4. Although there were some aspects of the appellant's history in relation
    to which the Immigration Judge was not satisfied that he had been given
    a full or adequate account, he made a number of  material  findings  of
    fact.  First he made the general finding that he  accepted  substantial
    elements of the appellant's account given  the  extent  of  the  detail
    provided by him, and its  consistency  with  the  extensive  background
    material before him.

 5. Secondly he accepted the details given  by  the  appellant  as  to  his
    background and family.  The appellant was one of ten children.  One  of
    his sisters became involved in a relationship with Abu Bakr, and  as  a
    result the appellant was often in his company.  Abu  Bakr  subsequently
    became the leader of JAM  in  Trinidad.   Another  of  the  appellant's
    sisters, J, became involved with a man called Trevor, one of Abu Bakr's
    followers.  A third sister, A, was married to  another  of  Abu  Bakr's
    followers.

 6. The Immigration Judge found that the appellant joined JAM in the 1980's
    and converted to the Muslim religion as part of the process of joining.
     He also found that  the  appellant  "took  part  in  various  unlawful
    activities with the Jaamat  including  the  transportation  of  illegal
    weapons and drugs and the murder of a man who was deemed to be an enemy
    of the Jaamat."  As to his role in the attempted coup, the  appellant's
    evidence was that he had been instructed to use his  lorry,  the  lorry
    that he drove as a result of employment obtained for him by  Abu  Bakr,
    to pick up armed members of JAM and drive them into the police compound
    where the attempt to overturn the government would begin.  He said that
    it was on the evening before the  coup,  that  he  decided  not  to  go
    through with the plan, and  went  to  ground.   The  Immigration  Judge
    accepted that the appellant had been given a part to play by Abu  Bakr,
    and continued:

           "I accept that he has fallen out with the Jaamat and/its  leader
           Abu Bakr, which may relate at least in part to  his  failure  to
           carry out his assigned role in the 1990 coup,  and  that  before
           his departure for the UK he was shot  at  by  two  men  whom  he
           believes  were  from  the  Jaamat.   I  accept  that  he   fears
           retribution from Jaamat if he were to  return  to  Trinidad  and
           that these fears are  based  on  threats  that  have  been  made
           against him and the attempted shooting in 2002."


 7. At paragraphs 49 - 52 the Immigration Judge made what he  described  as
    'Overall Findings'.  Paragraph 50 is in the following terms:

           "I acknowledge the brutal character and methods  of  the  Jaamat
           and I accept that for the appellant, who was previously involved
           with the Jaamat but has fallen out with them, there is a risk of
           violence from them on his return."


 8. But the Immigration Judge then went on to consider the evidence  as  to
    the period of two  years  during  which  the  appellant  had  lived  in
    Trinidad on his return from the United States,  working  as  an  estate
    constable for the police.  Whilst accepting that the appellant had been
    shot at by  men  whom  he  believed  to  be  associated  with  JAM,  he
    considered that the appellant had failed to take serious steps to avail
    himself of state protection.  The appellant had given evidence that  he
    had gone to a police  station  with  the  intention  of  reporting  the
    incident, but that the duty officer was a man whom he  believed  to  be
    associated with JAM, and he did not therefore identify the men who  had
    shot at him as JAM members.  The Immigration Judge expressed  the  view
    that it was possible that the appellant's  reluctance  to  seek  police
    assistance was partly or substantially motivated by concern as  to  the
    consequences of disclosing to them his own past  association  with  the
    Jamaat and involvement in criminal activities, and went on to  conclude
    that the fact that he had been able to live a  relatively  normal  life
    for a period of two years suggested that both the risk and the level of
    interest by Jaamat might be relatively limited.


 9. He concluded at paragraph 53 of the determination that:


           "Taking all these factors into account, I am  not  satisfied  to
           the standard of proof required that the appellant  has  a  well-
           founded fear of persecution or that he would be unable or  owing
           to such fear unwilling to avail himself of the protection of the
           Trinidadian authorities.  Whilst the Trinidadian state has shown
           very manifest deficiencies in  combating  organised  crime  from
           Jaamat and other groups, I am  not  satisfied  on  the  evidence
           before me that there would be an insufficiency of protection  in
           relation to this appellant."

10. The Immigration Judge had before him an expert  report  from  Professor
    Andrew Silke.  We have had the benefit of  a  supplementary  report  in
    which Professor Silke addressed the specific issue of the  ability  and
    willingness of the Trinidad  and  Tobago  authorities  to  protect  the
    appellant.  We also heard evidence from Professor Silke.  At paragraphs
    34 - 43 of the determination the Immigration Judge provided  a  summary
    of the country material and the report from Professor Silke:


           "34. I have been provided  by  the  Appellant's  representatives
           with a substantial quantity of documentation on Trinidad and the
           Jaamat al-Muslimeen group consisting of a large number of  press
           reports,  journal  articles  and  other  reports  together  with
           Professor Silke's report.  I have to take into account that much
           of the materials particularly the numerous press reports are  of
           a rather anecdotal and/or  subjective  nature  and  whilst  they
           carry weight, I give somewhat greater weight to  more  objective
           sourced reports such as that from the  International  Commission
           of Jurists.  So far as the expert witness Dr Silke is concerned,
           I note that he has a strong academic background in the study  of
           terrorism and terrorist organisations.  His report appears to be
           well researched and sourced, albeit he confirmed at the  hearing
           that he does not have any special expertise on the Jaamat or  on
           Trinidad  apart  from  a  study  he  has  carried  out  on   the
           Trinidadian prison system.  Nevertheless  his  report  seeks  to
           present a balanced view  based  on  his  information  about  the
           Appellant, his background knowledge of  terrorist  organisations
           and the more specific background sources  consulted  by  him  in
           preparation of his report.


       35. Jaamat al-Muslimeen is described in an article from the issue of
           'Terrorism Monitor' (21.6.07) as follows:


           'JAM' was founded in the 1980s  by  Yasin  Abu  Bakr,  an  Afro-
           Trinidadian Muslim convert  born  Lennox  Philip  and  a  former
           police  officer.   The  organisation  has   traditionally   been
           comprised primarily of Afro-Trinidadian Muslim converts to Sunni
           Islam.  Its ideology and discourse combine a  mix  of  the  most
           extreme fringes of pan-African nationalism  and  black  identity
           politics with Islamist rhetoric and symbolism.'


           Professor Silke  states:  'Whilst  JAM  is  certainly  a  partly
           religiously motivated group, it would be a mistake to view it as
           an offshoot or affiliate of groups such as al-Qaeda ... What  is
           clearer is that JAM remains involved in serious organised  crime
           activities.  These  include  gun  smuggling,  drug  trafficking,
           kidnap murder and extortion ...  For  the  Trinidad  and  Tobago
           authorities, JAM thus presents many of the characteristics of an
           organised crime gang albeit one with serious political interests
           and ambitions.'

       36. The involvement of  Jaamat  in  the  coup  attempt  in  1990  is
           extensively documented.  It appears that the Prime Minister  and
           most of his cabinet were taken hostage and  for  five  days  the
           capital was plunged into  violence  and  disarray.   Eventually,
           Jaamat was persuaded to surrender after a period of negotiations
           and the promise of some form of amnesty.  However, the terms and
           validity of the amnesty  were  contentious  and  the  government
           pursued legal action against Abu Bakr and other Jaamat  members.
           This  has  become  a  long-running  saga.   A  report  from  the
           Immigration & Refugee Board of Canada states (p.77  of  bundle):
           'Although Trinidadian government lawyers argued that the pardons
           were invalid because they were given  under  duress,  the  Privy
           Council in London upheld the legal  status  of  the  pardons  in
           December 1991 ... In July 1992 the Court of  Appeal  upheld  the
           government amnesty given during the crisis and  all  114  Jaamat
           members jailed since the coup were released.'


       37.  The  violent  and  ruthless  nature  of  the  group  under  the
           leadership of Abu Bakr is very apparent  and  this  ruthlessness
           clearly extends to  treatment  of  its  own  members  or  former
           members. Professor Silke states that 'cases  of  former  members
           being attacked by the movement are reported relatively regularly
           in the media' and there is indeed reference to a number of  such
           cases in the reports and newspaper articles before me.

       38. The background materials also focus on the nature of  the  legal
           and judicial system in Trinidad which is relevant to  the  issue
           of its ability to protect its citizens from groups such  as  the
           Jaamat.  The report from the International Commission of Jurists
           on the legal and judicial system in Trinidad is headed  'Attacks
           on Justice ' Trinidad  &  Tobago'  and  states  in  its  opening
           section:   'Judicial   independence   is   entrenched   in   the
           constitution and safeguarded in law and  in  practice  ...   The
           areas of concern remain  the  heavy  workload  of  judges,  poor
           conditions of detention and lack of effective access to  justice
           for the most impoverished sectors of the community ...'


           In a section on impunity, the report  highlights  problems  with
           the abuse of prisoners by police and prison guards, the  use  of
           lethal  force  by  the  police  ...,  lengthy  delays  in  trial
           proceedings and poor prison conditions.


           In another section on access to justice, the report states:


           'The standards required for a fair trial have been undermined by
           the failure of the government to institute an  effective  system
           of  witness  protection,  provide  legal  aid,  exclude  coerced
           confessions from court evidence and  in  many  instances  ensure
           that suspects are informed of their right to counsel.'


       39. A 2008 Amnesty International report  on  Trinidad  refers  to  a
           parliamentary report which was highly  critical  of  the  police
           service, highlighting 'the persistent failure by police officers
           to appear in courts as complainants or witnesses leading to many
           cases being dismissed.  The report  noted  a  disturbingly  high
           number of disciplinary charges against officers and the need  to
           combat  increased  levels  of  indiscipline  within  the  police
           service.   The  report  also  spoke  of  a   serious   lack   of
           accountability from top to bottom in the force.'  On the justice
           system, the report stated: 'The Justice Protection Programme  to
           protect witnesses was  widely  criticised  with  many  witnesses
           reportedly declining to give evidence at the last moment because
           of threats.'


       40. A 2008 report on Trinidad from 'Freedom House' refers to similar
           problems.

           'Trinidad & Tobago is believed to suffer  from  high  levels  of
           official corruption ... Trinidad & Tobago was ranked 79  out  of
           180 countries  surveyed  in  Transparency  International's  2007
           Corruption Perceptions Index.'


           'The judicial branch is independent but it is  subject  to  some
           political pressure and corruption.  As a result of rising  crime
           rates the court system is severely backlogged in some cases  for
           up to  five  years  with  an  estimated  20,000  criminal  cases
           awaiting trial ...'


           'Corruption in the police force which is often  drug-related  is
           endemic  and  law  enforcement  inefficiency  results   in   the
           dismissal of some criminal cases.  The police have  however  won
           praise for establishing a branch of Crime Stoppers ...'


       41. A BBC report dated 4.12.06 headed 'Abu Bakr  Freed'  illustrates
           the difficulties of obtaining convictions.  It describes the end
           of the trial of Abu Bakr for conspiracy to murder, in which  the
           jury was directed by the judge to bring in a not-guilty verdict.
            The reasons given by the judge were that the evidence given  by
           the state's main witness was  weak,  manifestly  unreliable  and
           disintegrated under cross-examination.


           'During the trial, which was a re-trial as a previous jury could
           not return a majority decision, state witness Miller on  several
           occasions crossed himself up, he said too that he  had  lied  in
           his original statement to the police.  And  he  told  the  court
           that he did not feel safe.  Even one police officer when he came
           before the judge said he could not remember vital evidence.'


           Professor Silke also referred to this unsuccessful trial in  his
           report, pointing out also that 'one of the alleged  targets  ...
           was later shot dead by an unknown gunman in 2007.'

       42. An article in Terrorism Monitor of 9.3.06 refers to  perceptions
           of Abu Bakr's untouchability but suggests that the  authorities'
           are beginning to act in a more determined way.


           'Until now Abu Bakr's influence  among  a  narrow  albeit  vocal
           segment of the Afro-Trinidadian population and  his  willingness
           to resort to  violence  and  other  radical  measures  made  him
           virtually untouchable.  His reach extends from corrupt  elements
           of the police and security services all the  way  to  the  upper
           echelons of political power including Trinidad's major political
           parties.  This influence insulated him  from  prosecution.   Abu
           Bakr sees himself  as  a  'kingmaker'  of  sorts  in  Trinidad's
           volatile political scene especially but  not  exclusively  among
           political parties that count  Afro-Trinidadians  as  a  base  of
           support.


           'Abu Bakr is no stranger to Trinidad's  legal  system.   He  and
           many of his followers have faced serious jail time  on  numerous
           occasions only to be released in the end for  political  reasons
           after serving modest sentences or no time at all.   Due  to  his
           impressive track record, many local sources think  that  he  may
           even escape the latest charges as well.


           At the same time the prosecution's strong case against  him  and
           the government's efforts to go after his organisation have taken
           on a greater sense of urgency.  For example Abu  Bakr  continues
           to be denied bail which was  unheard  of  in  the  past  despite
           Jaamat assurances that they will do everything in their power to
           topple the current government if their leader is  not  freed  on
           bond ... The state is also moving to confiscate  his  properties
           and to evict his four wives from his numerous homes.  It is also
           pressing the Jaamat to pay back over $30 million  to  the  state
           for property damaged during the coup attempt.'


      43.   Professor Silke's report contains a section on  the  ability  of
           the criminal justice system to protect witnesses and  vulnerable
           individuals.  He quotes from a press source that  in  one  month
           period in 2008, eight state witnesses were  killed  before  they
           could testify.  He quotes also from a Magistrate's  report  that
           the retraction of evidence or deviation from statements was  the
           single biggest cause  of  failed  prosecutions  and  of  witness
           intimidation being identified as one of the  principal  reasons.
           Professor Silke's view, which was based on his expert  knowledge
           of terrorist groups combined with  his  reading  of  reports  on
           Trinidad, is that the police would  be  unable  to  protect  the
           Appellant adequately from the threat he faces.   This  view  was
           backed up by reference to evidence of  the  lack  of  resources,
           ineffectiveness and  corruption  of  the  police  services,  the
           documented cases of former members of the Jaamat who  have  been
           murdered, and the poor conviction rates against  Jaamat  members
           for crimes committed including those associated  with  the  coup
           itself.  Professor Silke also considers that the Appellant would
           not be covered by  the  Trinidad  witness  protection  programme
           which is in any event  not  effective  in  protecting  perceived
           enemies of the Jaamat."

11. At paragraph 34 the Immigration Judge described Professor Silke's first
    report as "well researched and sourced", and said  that  it  "seeks  to
    present a balanced view based on his information about  the  appellant,
    his background knowledge of terrorist organisations and  more  specific
    background sources consulted by him in the preparation of his  report."
    Having heard evidence from Professor Silke that is a view with which we
    are in full agreement.


12. In his supplementary report, which was dated 25 October 2010, Professor
    Silke drew attention to the murder rate in Trinidad and  Tobago,  which
    has risen from 118 in 2000 to 506 in 2009, and which now represents one
    of the highest national murder rates in the world currently standing at
    41.03 murders per 100,000 people.  In comparison  the  murder  rate  in
    England and Wales is 1.49 murders  per  100,000  people.   The  current
    police statistics indicate that the murder rate in Trinidad and  Tobago
    will either be the same or slightly  higher  in  2010.   Detection  and
    conviction rates appear to be extremely low.  The crisis in policing in
    Trinidad  and  Tobago  is  well  recognised.   In  July   2009   Acting
    Commissioner of Police, James Filbert,  acknowledged  that  the  Police
    Service owed the nation an apology for the  poor  quality  of  policing
    experienced by some sectors of society over the years.  Professor Silke
    observes that the exact causes of the crisis are  unclear,  although  a
    variety of factors are believed to play a role,  in  particular  under-
    manning, poor  training  and  systemic  corruption.   Whilst  a  reform
    process has been introduced since 2006, which has involved  inter  alia
    the supplementing of the police force with officers  from  the  UK  and
    from Canada (in September 2010 Senior Canadian officers were  appointed
    Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner, the two most senior  positions
    in the police force),  to  date  the  measures  taken  to  improve  the
    situation do not appear to have had a significant positive impact.


13. Professor Silke also drew attention to the particular problems faced by
    the authorities in providing  effective  protection  for  witnesses  in
    criminal cases.  As he observes, an observation based upon a number  of
    examples derived from authoritative sources, "state witnesses are  shot
    dead every year  while  others  simply  disappear.   The  circumstances
    behind the killings vary.   In  the  past  year,  witnesses  have  been
    murdered at their own homes, while  others  have  been  killed  in  and
    around the court buildings while being escorted  by  police  officers."
    Mrs Tanner, the Home Office presenting officer, made the point that the
    appellant is neither a witness, nor likely to become one, arguing  that
    the apparent inability of the state to afford protection  to  witnesses
    is therefore not of relevance to the instant case.  But as Miss Benitez
    submitted in response, the fact that the State  is  unable  to  provide
    effective protection for those under a witness protection scheme,  adds
    considerable weight to the argument that the state would not be able to
    give adequate protection to an individual at risk, but not within  such
    a scheme.


14. The respondent introduced in evidence a letter  from  the  Foreign  and
    Commonwealth Office dated 6  October  2010  and  headed  "Trinidad  and
    Tobago Legal System - Sufficiency of Protection".  The letter is terse,
    consisting  of  three  short  paragraphs.   The   relevant   paragraph,
    paragraph 3, is in the following terms:


            "Legal sources advise that the witness protection  scheme  which
           is in place is not hugely secure - Trinidad and Tobago are small
           islands and it is hard to keep locations secret (there have been
           incidences of people in witness protection being murdered)   for
           some cases (mainly high profile capital cases)   witnesses  have
           been moved to the US or the UK."


    There is nothing in the letter that is inconsistent with the content of
    the reports from Professor Silke.


Conclusion


  15. There can be no doubt as to the  willingness  of  the  authorities  in
      Trinidad and Tobago to operate an effective system for the  detection,
      prosecution and punishment of acts constituting persecution or serious
      harm of its citizens.  The issue is the adequacy  of  such  protection
      (see e.g. IM (Sufficiency of protection) Malawi [2007]  UKAIT  00071).
      Mrs Tanner readily acknowledged the deficiencies in  the  system,  but
      argued that the appellant would not have a profile likely  to  attract
      the attention of JAM given that he has been away from Trinidad for  18
      of the past 20 years, and had lived there for  a  period  of  2  years
      immediately prior to his entry to the United Kingdom.   She  therefore
      argued that any risk to which he is subject is that of the  population
      at large.


  16. But that submission fails to take account of the  express  finding  by
      the Immigration Judge, preserved before us, that the  appellant  would
      be at risk of violence from JAM given his  previous  involvement  with
      that organisation, the fact that he was pressured to join them in  the
      first place and then left suddenly, just before  the  attempted  coup.
      Whilst a considerable period has elapsed since that abortive  coup  in
      1990  and  the  appellant's  subsequent  flight  from  Trinidad,   the
      aftermath of the coup continues to resonate.  As the Immigration Judge
      noted at paragraph of 37 of the determination:


           "The  violent  and  ruthless  nature  of  the  group  under  the
           leadership of Abu Bakr is very apparent  and  this  ruthlessness
           clearly extends to  treatment  of  its  own  members  or  former
           members.  Professor Silke states that 'cases of  former  members
           being attacked by the movement are reported relatively regularly
           in the media' and there is indeed reference to a number of  such
           cases in the reports and newspaper articles before me."

  17. In his first report Professor Silke  concluded  that  the  appellant's
      fear that he would be targeted by  JAM  members  (either  directly  or
      indirectly) if he returned to Trinidad was credible and realistic.  He
      concluded his supplementary report by saying:

           "Given the current crisis facing policing in the Islands and the
           authorities' long-running problem of  protecting  witnesses  and
           vulnerable witnesses in similar cases, there is  no  expectation
           that the authorities will be effectively able to protect Mr B in
           the short or medium term.  In cases where the police  have  been
           able to provide very strong protection  to  individuals  it  has
           either been in the context of a very short time frame (hours  or
           days) or else has involved very high profile  cases  which  have
           attracted a great deal of national  media  interested.   Mr  B's
           circumstances do not  fall  into  the  second  category,  and  a
           permanent return to Trinidad and Tobago requires more  than  the
           short-term protection seen in other instances  (although  it  is
           unlikely that Mr B would be deemed  to  qualify  for  even  this
           short-term protection)."

  18. In the light of that conclusion, based as we are satisfied that it is,
      on a careful  and  comprehensive  analysis  of  the  country  material
      produced by both parties, in the light of the findings of fact made by
      the Immigration Judge and of the limited ambit of the task as given to
      us by the Court of Appeal, we are satisfied to the requisite  standard
      of proof  that  the  appellant  has  shown  a  well  founded  fear  of
      persecution by reason of his political opinion, actual and/or imputed,
      through his  anti-JAM  stance  and  his  pro-government  activity,  in
      particular as a precepted estate constable, that  being  the  work  he
      performed during the 2 year period prior to his  arrival  in  the  UK,
      were he to be returned to Trinidad and Tobago now, and  secondly  that
      there would be an insufficiency of protection were that to happen.  It
      follows  that  in  our  judgment  he  is  entitled  to   international
      protection in the form  of  refugee  status  under  the  1951  Refugee
      Convention and to protection on human rights grounds under  article  3
      ECHR.


  19. The Immigration Judge materially erred in law  and  his  decision  has
      been set aside. The decision we re-make is to  allow  the  appellant's
      appeal.
