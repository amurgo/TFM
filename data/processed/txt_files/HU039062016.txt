For the Appellant:     No representation
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Nepal now aged 27.  On 23  December  2015
    he applied for entry clearance to settle in the UK as the dependent son
    of sponsor Mr Sunuwar Khadga Bahadur, a former Gurkha soldier who  came
    to the UK for settlement  in  February  2011.   The  appellant  is  the
    sponsor's youngest son.  The respondent refused his application  on  14
    January 2016.  The appellant appealed.  He did not pay the fee  for  an
    oral hearing and his case was determined on the papers by Judge Aziz of
    the First-tier Tribunal.  In a decision sent on 24 February 2017  Judge
    Aziz dismissed his appeal.

2.   The  appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  appear  to  be  drafted  by  the
    appellant  himself  but  essentially  take  issue  with   the   judge's
    assessment that he was not financially and emotionally dependent on the
    sponsor.

3.   At the hearing the appellant was not legally represented.  The  sponsor
    attended together with his wife but it was clear neither spoke  English
    adequately.  A family friend, Ms Chandika Sunuwar, attended  with  them
    and was able to communicate with them on and impart salient matters  to
    them, but was not able  to  help  convey  the  sponsor's  view  of  the
    proceedings.

4.   Having discussed the case with Mr Duffy, I  satisfied  myself  that  it
    was appropriate to proceed with the hearing,  notwithstanding  lack  of
    input from the sponsor.  The reason for that is that Mr Duffy  conceded
    that the judge's decision was legally flawed.

5.   There are several ostensible difficulties with the  judge's  assessment
    of the key issues in  this  appeal.   At  paragraphs  39-42  the  judge
    stated:

         "39. The appellant's case is that even though he is an adult, he is
             emotionally and financially dependent upon  his  parents.   He
             has not established an independent  family  life  (unlike  his
             other siblings).  It was always his  parents'  intentions  for
             him to join him in the United Kingdom and the only reason they
             are living apart is because of this immigration decision.


         40.  There is a large amount of documentary evidence  submitted  in
             support of the assertion that  the  appellant  is  financially
             dependent upon his parents and that they continue  to  support
             him following the completion of  his  education.   I  am  also
             persuaded that the appellant has been able to submit  evidence
             that he is in regular and ongoing contact with his parents and
             that they do visit him in Nepal.


         41.  However, the  appellant  does  not  dispute  the  respondent's
             assertion that he  is  an  able-bodied  individual.   In  such
             circumstances, I do not find that the appellant has been  able
             to provide satisfactory explanation as to why he is unable  to
             work.  He is a young, educated man in his mid-20s.  Whilst  he
             may be financially supported by his parents, there is  nothing
             on the evidence before the Tribunal to indicate that any  such
             dependency is out of necessity.


         42.  The case law in this  area  establishes  that  there  must  be
             'elements of dependency  going  beyond  the  normal  emotional
             ties'.  If such dependency is not found, then the  refusal  to
             admit  members  of  the  family  simply  does  not  constitute
             interference with family life.  On  the  evidence  before  the
             Tribunal, I find that the  appellant  has  not  been  able  to
             persuade the Tribunal that there are  elements  of  dependency
             which go beyond normal emotional ties".


6.   Given the judge's acceptance of financial dependency, it is clear  that
    the appellant was entitled to consider that his case  fell  within  the
    material scope of Article 8(1) of the ECHR so long as he  was  able  to
    establish emotional dependency.  The only clear reasons  given  by  the
    judge for finding that the appellant was not emotionally dependent were
    that:


         (1)  he was someone  who  was  able  to  work  and  was  young  and
         educated;


         (2)  the dependency was not dependency of necessity.


    In reaching these conclusions the judge failed to conduct any  kind  of
    weighing up of the relevant evidence.  Relevant evidence  included  the
    appellant's account of his  parents  visiting  him  once  a  year,  and
    maintaining regular electronic communication with him.   Following  the
    Court of Appeal judgment in Rai [2017] EWCA Civ  329  and  the  Court's
    finding in that  case  that  one  "critical"  question  when  assessing
    whether there exists "family life" for the purposes of Article 8(1)  is
    whether "even though the appellant's parents had chosen to leave  Nepal
    to settle in the UK when they did, his family life with them  subsisted
    then and was still subsisting at the time of the [tribunal]  decision".
    The judge wholly failed to consider this issue.  The judge was wrong to
    decide  the  issue  of  emotional  dependency   without   taking   into
    consideration the above factors.  The judge was also wrong  to  require
    that the dependency be of necessity.  That is not the  test  in  Gurkha
    soldier family cases.


7.   Mr Duffy also saw as a further deficiency in the judge's  decision  his
    failure to analyse Annex K criteria, given that  this  Annex  does  not
    treat the length  of  time  an  applicant  has  lived  apart  from  the
    sponsor{s} as determinative.

8.   In light of  the  above,  I  conclude  that  the  judge's  decision  is
    vitiated by legal error and is to be set aside.

9.   Given that the key issues in this case  are  highly  fact-sensitive,  I
    consider that it should be remitted to the FtT (not before Judge Aziz).
     However, as things stand at present, the case will have to proceed, as
    before, as one to be determined on the papers, as the appellant has not
    paid the requisite fee of ï¿½80 stipulated  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Fees Order 2011.

    If the appellant wishes to achieve an oral hearing he will need to  pay
    that fee as soon as possible.


10.  Assuming the appellant pays this fee, the case would then (instead)  be
    listed for an oral hearing at which the sponsor would  be  able  if  he
    chose to give oral evidence and also be represented.  At the end of the
    hearing before me I conveyed via Ms Sunuwar  the  importance  that  the
    sponsor seek legal assistance if he wishes to  effectively  participate
    in this appeal.

11.  In order to give the appellant and sponsor time to take stock of


         (1)  whether they wish to have an oral hearing before the  FtT  (on
         remittal); and


         (2)  whether they decide to obtain legal representation,


    I direct that the FtT list this for a Case  Management  Review  hearing
    (or its equivalent) not before 31 February 2018.

12.  To conclude:

    The decision of the FtT Judge is set aside for material error of law.


    The case is remitted to the FtT (not before Judge Aziz).


    The case will be first considered at a Case Management  Review  hearing
    to be held at Taylor House.

No anonymity direction is made.
