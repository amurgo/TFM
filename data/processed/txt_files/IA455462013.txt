Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M B Hussain, of Zahra & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of the Philippines born on 16 April 1969 and
    he made an application on 5 April 2013  for  a  residence  card  as  an
    extended family member of an EEA national under Regulation 8(1) of  the
    Immigration (EEA Regulations) 2006.  That application was refused on 26
    October 2013.

 2. The reasons for refusal identified that the appellant had not  provided
    any evidence of dependency on his EEA  national  sponsor  at  any  time
    either in the Philippines or in the United Kingdom and that he was  not
    dependent on his EEA sponsor immediately prior to entering  the  United
    Kingdom as required under Regulation 8(2)(a).

 3. It was stated that he had failed to provide sufficient evidence that he
    was dependent upon or residing with his sponsor prior to  entering  the
    UK and the appeal was refused.

 4. That matter came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Monson on 2  December
    2014 and he dismissed the appeal on 16 December 2014 on the basis  that
    the appellant had not proved prior dependence on either his  sister  or
    brother-in-law.  The appellant came to  the  UK  on  16  October  2008.
    Secondly, the judge found that it was not  satisfactorily  demonstrated
    that the appellant's sister was generating  an  income  in  the  period
    running up to November 2008 in which he was able to  provide  financial
    support to the family in the Philippines.

 5. An application for permission to appeal was made on the basis that  the
    evidence before the First-tier Tribunal showed a series of  remittances
    by the appellant's sister in 2008 and prior to the appellant's  arrival
    in the UK.  In total the  sum  of  �8,950  had  been  remitted  to  the
    appellant in 2008 and whilst the judge accepted that a  sum  of  �4,000
    was sent in 2005 he failed to accept that a sum of �8,950  remitted  in
    2008 was a significant sum of money.  There was no mention of the total
    sum and it was unclear whether the judge recognised that this  sum  was
    indeed remitted by the appellant's sister.

 6. Secondly, it was submitted  that  it  was  not  clear  that  the  judge
    considered the remittances made by the appellant's sister in the period
    of time leading up to the arrival in the UK following Rahman and Others
    v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2012]  EUECJ  C-83/11,
    [2013] 2 WLR 230.  This identifies  that  the  period  of  time  to  be
    considered is that shortly before or at the time the appellant  arrived
    in the UK and the  judge  failed  to  consider  the  relevant  time  of
    assessment.

 7. Thirdly, the  judge  found  there  was  an  inconsistency  between  the
    remittance slip provided by CBN Limited, (appellant's  bundle  [66-68])
    and the printout of transactions from CBN Limited  (appellant's  bundle
    [78-81])  and  found  this  to  be  a   "highly   significant   anomaly
    (determination [29]).  However  this  finding  was  predicated  on  the
    assertion that the printout of  transactions  listed  all  transactions
    between  2005  and  2009.   In  fact  the   printout   only   confirmed
    transactions from the period December 2008 to  February  2009  and  the
    judge erred in concluding that the appellant's  bundle  [78-81]  was  a
    complete document.  In fact  the  printout  was  on  page  78  under  a
    covering letter at page 77.   Pages  79-91  related  to  other  records
    provided   by   the   appellant   to   support   the   assertion   that


             had made remittances.  It was for that  reason  that  page  78
    referred to page 2 of 2.

 8. Fourthly the judge found that it was not possible to  identify  whether
    the sums sent by the appellant's sister were for the appellant  himself
    or other members of his family.  The judge accepted that the sums  were
    remitted to the appellant or the appellant's  wife  at  least  implying
    that they were for the benefit of the appellant and his wife.

 9. It was submitted that the judge failed to consider  the  evidence  that
    the appellant was not working, had no independent source of income  and
    did not have the skills to find a job in the city (determination [10]).
     In the absence of any independent source of  income  from  either  the
    appellant or his wife with which to support themselves and their  three
    children it was submitted that the  judge  perversely  found  that  the
    appellant was not supported by his sister through remittances from  the
    UK.  Further, even if some of the remitted sums benefited other  family
    members this alone was insufficient to allow the judge to conclude that
    the appellant's essential living needs were not met by  those  remitted
    sum.

10. Fifthly, the judge considered  that  the  appellant's  sister  was  not
    earning sufficient sums to make the remittances.  The  sums  must  have
    come from the husband which was, he found  not  permitted.   There  was
    however, no rule of Community law which  precluded  a  relationship  of
    dependence  from  being  established  in  circumstances  where  an  EEA
    national and her spouse collated their joint income and  used  part  of
    their joint income to make remittances to family members abroad.

11. At the hearing before me Ms Isherwood agreed that the Home  Office  had
    not contested this last point on funds deriving from the  wife  or  the
    husband as this was not raised in the reasons for  refusal  letter  and
    was not relevant.

12. Mr Hussain relied on the written reasons for application for permission
    to appeal.  If the  judge  was  suggesting  that  pages  66-68  were  a
    fabrication this was not set out and the judge should have  taken  into
    account the context of the sponsor's evidence.  He did not appear to do
    so.  I was referred to paragraph 7 of  the  witness  statement  of  the
    sponsor.  In effect the judge had failed to take into account the  oral
    evidence.

13. Ms Isherwood stated that the grounds were seeking to re-argue the  case
    and trying to put more weight on  evidence  presented.   The  appellant
    continually made applications in  2007  and  at  paragraph  19  of  the
    determination it was recorded that the appellant's  representative  had
    acknowledged there was a  difficulty  with  the  evidence  and  it  was
    inferential. As the judge recorded the affidavit raised more  questions
    than it answered and the implication from the affidavit of the wife was
    that the sister-in-law did not send any money to either account between
    2006 and 2008.  Further  paragraph  34  indicated  that  there  was  an
    anomaly whereby prior to October 2008 the purpose  of  the  remittances
    was designated to savings rather than remittances for "family support".
     The judge had gone through  the  evidence  and  made  the  appropriate
    findings.

14. In conclusion the nub of this matter,  as  the  judge  identified,  was
    whether the appellant was dependent on his sponsor prior to his arrival
    in the UK.  The challenge rests largely on the judge's treatment of the
    evidence of support  and  the  remittances  made  in  2008.  The  judge
    accepted that there was dependency  by  the  appellant  in  the  United
    Kingdom on an EEA national.   The critical  point  is  that  dependence
    also needs to be shown before the appellant's  arrival  in  the  United
    Kingdom which was on 16th October 2008. It is said there is an error in
    paragraphs 27 - 29 of the determination which state that  the  list  of
    transactions printed out by CBN Grupo on 28 July 2014 at pages 78 to 81
    of the appellant's bundle covered all remittances from  2005  to  2009.
    That, it is said, is not correct as pages 78-81 could not be  read  all
    together because, as  indicated,  the  CBN  sender  transaction  report
    attached to the letter was marked '2 of 2' indicating that  the  letter
    was sent with just one list of transactions and those transactions only
    referred to December 2008 to February 2009.  Page 2, it is  said,  does
    not cover all remittances from 2005 to 2009.

15. At paragraph 29 the judge states as follows:

    "The printout to which I refer does not tally  with  the  documents  at
    pages 66 to 68 of the  bundle,  which  purport  to  be  copies  of  six
    remittances sent to the appellant's wife earlier  in  2008.   As  these
    copies appear to have been  generated  retrospectively  by  CBN  London
    Limited (a division of CBN Grupo) seven  days  earlier,  their  absence
    from the printout is a highly significant anomaly."

     The printout to which  he  is  referring  would  not  refer  to  those
    remittances because it starts at a later date.  There are, however, two
    printouts and it is stated by the appellant that  the  second  printout
    relates to other  records  of  the  sister  sending  remittances.   The
    problem with the remittance challenge is that neither of the  printouts
    provided tallied with the  separate  remittances  sent.    There  is  a
    further letter dated 21st July from CBN Grupo  (p  65  of  the  bundle)
    which merely states that there is  attached  a  list  of  transactions.
    Following on in the bundle is the set of remittances but these  do  not
    appear to have been identified in any  of  the  lists  of  transactions
    sent.

16. Clearly the appellant asked the bank for print outs of all the payments
    made and CBN was able to produce a list  from  2005  and  although  the
    second printout list refers to remittances in 2008 it does not identify
    the six remittances at pages 66-68 (dated 9/6/2008  (�1,000),  8/5/2008
    (�1,000), 7/17/2008 (�1,000),  10/2/2008  (�600),  7/26/2008  (�1,300),
    7/29/2008 �1,500)) in the sum of �6,950.  Neither list in  response  to
    the appellant's enquiries of that bank  produced  a  printout  list  of
    these aforementioned remittances.

17. Although, the judge relies on the printout out  dated  28th  July  2014
    which does not, as I state, cover those  six  remittances,  the  second
    printout [p 79 -81] does not refer to those six payments made  in  2008
    either. It could be expected that as the bank could produce a list from
    2005 that it would produce a full list with all the  payments  made  in
    2008.  It did not.

18. The judge thus rightly appears to reject the  six  CBN  London  Limited
    printed out remittances to the appellant and his wife.

19. In addition it is asserted that the judge did not take into account the
    context of the appellant's circumstances  before  his  arrival  in  the
    United  Kingdom  which  included  his  lack  of  employment.  This  was
    underlined in the sister's oral evidence which is recorded at  [12]  of
    the decision and which  claims  that  she  supported  her  brother  the
    appellant.  The judge rightly notes [35] that the  appellant  does  not
    have to show that he was either wholly or mainly financially  dependent
    on the sponsor when living in the Philippines.  He only needs  to  show
    that the sponsor was providing material support to meet  his  essential
    needs.

20. The evidence recorded at paragraph 12  of Judge Monson's  decision  was
    that the appellant's sister was called and that she gave evidence  that
    she alone was responsible for supporting members of her family  in  the
    Philippines and in particular Domingo (the appellant)   and  the  widow
    and children of her deceased brother Conrad and of course  her  elderly
    mother.  She gave evidence that Domingo was the "simplest  of  all  her
    siblings" and had not acquired  any  educational  qualifications  which
    could earn him a living.  There was very little employment available in
    the village where the family home was and that she had wished  she  had
    kept receipts of the funds that she had sent over  to  the  Philippines
    but because of the passage of time it  was  very  difficult  to  obtain
    duplicates.  The evidence was that she  used  a  variety  of  companies
    called Global Express Money Remittance Limited  and  also  Multi  Money
    Transfer.  She also used to use the Allied Bank of the Philippines  and
    another  company  called  CBN  Grupo  who  had  managed  to  provide  a
    transaction report to show that she had sent money  to  Domingo  on  15
    January 2005.  That date is well before the key date  of  October  2008
    and the appellant's arrival.   As  indicated  in  the  application  for
    permission to appeal the relevant  time  is  that  shortly  before  the
    appellant's arrival. The  judge,  as  he  recorded  the  evidence,  was
    therefore clearly aware of this information when making his decision.

21. The judge, however, concentrated on the documentary evidence as it  was
    the sponsor's contention that she had transferred money to  an  account
    and was clear that he found the documentary evidence  contradicted  the
    claims of support.  He did not state that it was fabricated but clearly
    found it unreliable.

22. The judge dealt with the affidavits of M May  Dalanon  the  appellant's
    wife and his sister Milarosa D Buenaventura at paragraphs [26] and [27]
    which confirmed that was support  was  given.   The  judge  also  dealt
    clearly with the affidavit of Ms  Buenaventura  at  [27]  which  merely
    identifies that the appellant was a beneficiary when he needed  support
    and this does not take the matter much further. It did not  indicate  a
    specific time of support.

23. The judge found that the affidavit of the wife  did  not  indicate  any
    support in 2006 but specifically he found at  [26]  that  she  did  not
    indicate support received in 2008 despite being  the  main  conduit  of
    receiving remittances.  That point  further  undermines  the  assertion
    that remittances were made in 2008 prior to the appellant's arrival.

24. Even if the judge was in  error  in  his  findings  regarding  the  six
    remittances and the failure to identify the correct  printout,  I  find
    that this is not material for this reason.  The  wife  made  a  written
    statement on 26th March 2013 that she had an account with  her  husband
    with the Philippine National Bank PNB Balayan  Batangas  under  Savings
    Account  No  [                      ]and  another  account   with   the
    Metrobank.  The six remittances on  which  the  appellants  rely,  show
    payment to the Philippine National Bank in the name of the  appellant's
    wife.  She made no statement that she held  another  account  with  her
    husband with the Philippine National Bank and  this  written  statement
    was given after the remittances were said to have been made to her.   A
    copy of that account was produced in the appellant's bundle  and  which
    showed that for the year 2008 until November 2008  under  150  PHP  was
    received into that  account.  The account evidence does not support the
    contention that payments were made to the appellant or his wife in 2008
    prior to his arrival in the United Kingdom.

25. Although the account of the wife and the appellant are in  joint  names
    she states in her affidavit that money was sent  to  her  in  2005  and
    2007, she made no mention of 2008 and indeed as I point  out  financial
    support is not recorded in 2008 in her account.  The accounts with  the
    Philippine National Bank and the Metrobank were, as she  stated,   held
    in joint names.  It would appear  then  that  the  wife's  evidence  is
    consistent with the PNB account and with the judge's findings.

26. There was a further amount of �2,000 submitted  to  the  joint  account
    held at Metro Bank for the benefit of the sponsor  shortly  before  his
    arrival and although it was submitted that this was a sum in excess  of
    that needed for a holiday the judge found clearly at  [33]  that  this,
    not support, was the purpose of the remittance.

27. The discussion at [30] of the decision is  not  relevant  because  this
    postdates the prior  dependency  point  as  it  relates  to  2010.  The
    critical point is that  dependence  needs  to  be  shortly  before  the
    appellant's arrival in the United Kingdom which in this case  was  16th
    October 2008.

28. The point in relation to the income of the wife and her husband Zhu and
    Chen C-200/02 [2004] ECR 1 9925 and Commission v Belgium Case  C-408/03
    indicates that it is sufficient for nationals of a member State to have
    the necessary resources and there is no requirement as to the origin of
    the funds such that the income of a partner could not be excluded. This
    was not a point taken by the refusal letter and yet was a matter raised
    by the judge. No Home Office Presenting Officer attended the First tier
    tribunal hearing. Notwithstanding that, the judge stated at  [38]  that
    for the avoidance of doubt his primary finding was that  the  appellant
    had not proved support prior to the appellant's arrival.  The point  of
    from whom support was derived is therefore redundant.

29. I accept on an overall reading of the decision the judge made a careful
    and reasoned  assessment  of  the  evidence  and  although  noting  the
    evidence of the witnesses he clearly relied on  the  difficulties  with
    the documentary evidence to  dismiss  the  appeal.   He  addressed  the
    remittances and considered all the support said to have  been  made  in
    2008.  He gave reasons for failing to accept the six remittances.  This
    is the key point and grounds 4 and 5 of the challenge really depend  on
    whether there was a finding for support shown in 2008.  The judge found
    there was not.    I find that  there  is  no  error  of  law  which  is
    material.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal made no error of law which would  materially  affect
the outcome and the decision shall stand.
