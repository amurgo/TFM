For the Appellant:           Mr S. Crowther, Counsel instructed by IAS
(Manchester)
For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Iran born  in  1985.   He  appeals  with
    permission[1] the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Chana),
    who  on  the  24th  March  2017  dismissed  his  appeal   against   the
    Respondent's decision to refuse his protection claim.


 2. The basis of the  Appellant's  claim  was  that  he  had  converted  to
    Christianity and as such would face a real risk of serious harm in Iran
    because apostasy from Islam is considered a capital offence under  Shia
    jurisprudence.

 3. In rejecting his claim to be a genuine adherent of the Christian  faith
    the First-tier Tribunal summarised the evidence of the  Appellant,  and
    his Dorodian witness the Reverend Paul Ronald Benson  of  the  Atherton
    Baptist Church. The central ground of appeal is that in doing  so,  the
    Tribunal misrecorded - or alternatively misunderstood - their  evidence
    to the extent that  its  findings  cannot  be  considered  safe.    For
    instance, little weight is attached to Rev. Benson's  evidence  because
    he is said to have testified that his church accepts the word of anyone
    who says that they have converted; in fact Rev. Benson's  evidence  was
    that the true faith of converts is evaluated "through  interaction  and
    talking  to  them,  their  attendance,  reading  and  understanding  of
    scripture...there is no hard  and  fast  rule".   The  grounds  further
    contend that the Tribunal failed to have  regard  to  the  evidence  of
    another witness, the Reverend Pat Hinchliffe.

 4. In its assessment of risk the Tribunal concluded that there  was  none,
    since there was no prospect of the Iranian authorities knowing that the
    Appellant had been attending church in the UK. The Judge concluded that
    the Appellant was not a Christian, ergo he was still a Muslim and could
    not be said to face any risk.   The  second  limb  of  the  Appellant's
    challenge before me is that the Tribunal here failed  to  consider  the
    undisputed fact that the Appellant had been baptised. As  a  matter  of
    fact, he had formally converted and was therefore an apostate.

 5. Before me the Respondent conceded that both grounds had been made  out.
    The verbatim notes of Mr Outtara of the IAS had  been  produced,  along
    with a signed witness statement by him.  It  was  apparent  from  those
    notes, and indeed the  prepared  witness  statements,  that  there  was
    something of a divergence between the evidence given and the way it  is
    recorded in the determination.  The grounds give a number  of  examples
    but it suffices here to give one. At  paragraph  29  the  determination
    records the evidence as demonstrating that "anyone who  comes  to  this
    church claiming to have converted to  Christianity  is  believed".  Had
    that been the evidence of the Dorodian witness then the Tribunal  would
    of course have been entitled to place little weight on their testimony.
    The whole point about Dorodian witnesses are that these are people  who
    will be able to speak  to  the  claimant's  commitment  and  sincerity,
    having had, over a long period of close interaction, an opportunity  to
    assess those matters. Decision makers are not bound by  their  opinion,
    but it will ordinarily be the  case  that  significant  weight  can  be
    attached to it, because it will necessarily be an informed one. In this
    case it would appear that Judge Chana did not consider Rev. Benson  (or
    indeed Rev. Hinchcliffe who had given her evidence  in  writing  having
    already attended an earlier hearing) to be so informed.   The Appellant
    complains, with justification that  in  reaching  that  conclusion  the
    Tribunal appears to have overlooked Rev. Benson's evidence that he  had
    known the Appellant for over a year, that  the  Appellant  had  been  a
    regular attendee at services, bible study courses and  coffee  mornings
    at the church. Rev. Benson gave the oral  evidence  summarised  in  the
    grounds (at para 3 above) and spoke in his  witness  statement  of  his
    evaluation  of  the  Appellant's  sincerity  inter  alia  through   his
    observation of his participation in services and the way that he  lives
    his life.   Reverend Benson's evidence was, in the end, pivotal to  the
    overall determination in this case and it was therefore important  that
    it was accurately recorded and assessed.

 6. In  respect  of  the  second  ground  Mr  Harrison  conceded  that  the
    determination makes no reference to the  most  recent,  and  pertinent,
    country guidance of SSH and HR (illegal  exit:  failed  asylum  seeker)
    Iran CG [2016] UKUT 00308 (IAC). Therein the Upper Tribunal found  that
    the standard practice faced by returnees  to  Iran  is  that  they  are
    questioned about their asylum claims. Should  any  particular  concerns
    arise about those claims then the  returnee  will  be  transferred  for
    further questioning in a detention facility where there  will  arise  a
    real risk of serious harm. Although the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  this
    case directs itself to the  principles  in  Danian  [2000]  IAR  96  it
    nowhere assesses the  potential  risk  to  the  presumptively  truthful
    returnee who would when questioned admit to  having  been  baptised,  a
    ceremony which if nothing else would denote a  formal  renunciation  of
    Islam.

 7. The errors alleged in the grounds having been  made  out,  the  parties
    invited me to remit this matter to the First-tier Tribunal. In light of
    the extent of the fact finding required, I agree.



    Decisions

 8. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error  of
    law and it is set aside.


 9. The decision will be remade de novo in the First-tier Tribunal.

10. There is an order for anonymity.
