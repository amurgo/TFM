Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms L Appiah, of Counsel, instructed by Inayat
                    Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a national of Mauritius born on 13  February  1983,  has
    been granted permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  against  a
    decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal N Haria who  (following  a
    hearing on 7 October 2016) dismissed her appeal under  the  Immigration
    Rules and on human rights grounds against the respondent's decision  of
    18 May 2015 to refuse her application of 16 March 2015  for  indefinite
    leave to remain  based  on  long  residence  (i.e.  ten  years'  lawful
    residence).

 2. As the appellant's application was  made  on  16  March  2015  and  the
    Secretary of State's decision on 18 May 2015,  the  appellant  did  not
    have a right to appeal on immigration grounds. She could only appeal on
    human rights grounds. This is because ss.82 and 84 of the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the "2002 Act") were amended  by  s.15
    of the Immigration Act 2014  with  effect  from  20  October  2014  and
    because the transitional provisions do not apply.

 3. In relation to Article 8, the judge purported to consider  whether  the
    appellant's  appeal  should  be  allowed  under  para  276ADE  of   the
    Immigration Rules. She found that there would not be  very  significant
    obstacles to the  appellant's  reintegration  in  Mauritius.  She  then
    considered the Article 8 claim outside the Rules and concluded that the
    decision was not disproportionate.

 4. In her consideration of the Article 8  claim  outside  the  Rules,  the
    judge did not consider  the  submission  advanced  on  the  appellant's
    behalf, that her leave was extended under s.3C of the  Immigration  Act
    1971 (the "1971 Act") as a consequence of  which  she  had  ten  years'
    lawful  residence  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  at  the  date  of  her
    application of 16 March 2015. Para 12 of the  judge's  decision,  where
    she set out her reasons for refusing an adjournment request made on the
    appellant's behalf, suggests that she considered  that  the  respondent
    had correctly stated in the decision letter that the  total  period  of
    the appellant's lawful residence was 7 years  7  months,  i.e.  from  4
    September 2003 (the date when she entered the United Kingdom with leave
    as a student) and 20 April 2011, this being the date to which  she  was
    granted leave upon  the  Respondent's  reconsideration  of  an  earlier
    decision which was appealed successfully.

 5. It follows that, in assessing proportionality outside  the  Rules,  the
    judge considered that the period of lawful  residence  was  7  years  7
    months.

 6. It was not in dispute before the judge that  the  appellant  had  leave
    from the date of her arrival in the United Kingdom on 4 September  2003
    until 20 April 2011. This was a period of 7 years 7 months.

 7. The appellant's previous appeal was an appeal against a decision  of  9
    July 2010 to refuse her application of 29 May 2010 for leave to  remain
    as a Tier 4 student. In allowing the appeal on 16  November  2010,  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) concluded that the
    decision  was  not  in  accordance  with  the   law.   The   respondent
    reconsidered her decision. On 20 January 2011, the respondent issued  a
    biometric residence permit ("BRP") which stated that leave was  granted
    until 20 April 2011. The respondent accepted before the judge that this
    was sent to the wrong address. Before the judge, it was argued that the
    fact that the BRP had been sent to the wrong  address  meant  that  her
    leave continued under s.3C of the 1971 Act.

 8. Before me, Mr Tarlow accepted that  the  judge  had  erred  in  law  by
    failing to consider whether the appellant's leave  was  extended  under
    s.3C so that she continued  to  have  leave  as  at  the  date  of  her
    application. If she did have such leave (and Mr Tarlow accepted  before
    me that she did), the error was material  because  the  fact  that  the
    appellant had lawful residence for a continuous period of 10 years  was
    material to the balancing exercise in the assessment of the  Article  8
    claim outside the Rules.

 9. Accordingly, Ms Appiah and Mr Tarlow agreed that the  judge's  decision
    to dismiss the Article 8 claim outside the Rules should  be  set  aside
    and that the Upper Tribunal should proceed to re-make the  decision  on
    the appellant's appeal.

10. I am satisfied that the judge did materially err in law by  failing  to
    consider the submissions advanced before her on the appellant's  behalf
    that the appellant's leave was extended under s.3C up until the date of
    her application of 16 March 2015. I therefore set aside her decision to
    dismiss the appeal on human rights grounds and proceed to  re-make  the
    decision.

11. There is  no  dispute  between  the  parties  that  the  appellant  has
    established private life within Article 8(1), that  the  decision  will
    interfere with her private life and that the decision is in  accordance
    with the law for the purposes of Article 8(2). I therefore  proceed  to
    the  balancing   exercise   to   decide   whether   the   decision   is
    disproportionate.

12. I pause here to explain the reason why  Mr  Tarlow  accepted  that  the
    appellant's leave was extended  under  s.3C  notwithstanding  that  her
    appeal was finally determined on 16 November 2010. Given that the First-
    tier Tribunal allowed the appellant's appeal on  the  ground  that  the
    decision of 9 July 2010 was not in accordance with the law, he accepted
    that the respondent's guidance entitled: "Leave extended by section  3C
    (and leave extended by section 3D in transitional cases)", version 6.0,
    dated 21 March 2016, applied. Insofar as relevant, this reads:

            "Position following an allowed appeal

            Where an appeal has been allowed the Tribunal  in  allowing  the
             appeal may have found that the Secretary  of  State's  original
             decision was unlawful such that the  refusal  decision  is  set
             aside. This means that Secretary of State has  to  re-make  the
             decision. The effect on section 3C leave is that it reverts  to
             leave under section 3C(5) during the period between the  appeal
             being allowed and a new decision being made. As the decision is
             set aside, it is possible for the outstanding application to be
             varied during the period before it is decided."

13. Accordingly, Mr Tarlow accepted that the previous decision  of  9  July
    2010 was set aside and that the appellant's s.3C continued and that, as
    at the date of her application of 16 March 2015, she had more than  ten
    years' lawful residence.

14. I am satisfied that, as a matter of legal construction (and not  merely
    as  a  result  of  the  respondent's  guidance   quoted   above),   the
    respondent's decision of 9 July 2010 was set aside. The respondent  was
    therefore  required  to  make  a  new  decision  on   the   appellant's
    application of 29 May 2009 which remained  outstanding  and  which  was
    varied by her application of 16 March 2015, as is permitted pursuant to
    s.3C(5).  The fact that the respondent issued a BRP on 20 January  2011
    was irrelevant. It was not a decision on the appellant's application of
    29 May 2009.

15. Thus, the appellant's leave was  extended  under  s.3C  in  the  period
    between  her  appeal  being  allowed  on  16  November  2010  and   her
    application of 16 March 2015. She therefore had more  than  ten  years'
    lawful residence as at the date of her application of 16 March 2015.

16. The fact that  the  appellant  has  more  than  ten  years'  of  lawful
    residence is relevant to the  balancing  exercise  in  considering  her
    Article 8 claim outside the Rules.

17. After taking instructions, Mr Tarlow confirmed that the respondent does
    not take issue with  any  of  the  factors  in  para  276B(ii)  of  the
    Immigration Rules. He requested me to take this  into  account  in  re-
    making the decision on the appellant's appeal.

18. The fact that the respondent does  not  take  issue  with  any  of  the
    factors in para 276B(ii) means that, if the appellant had available  to
    her a ground of appeal to challenge the decision  under  para  276B,  I
    would find that, having regard to the public  interest,  there  are  no
    reasons why it would be undesirable for  her  to  be  given  indefinite
    leave to remain on the ground of long residence. This  means  that,  if
    the appellant had available to her a ground of appeal to challenge  the
    decision  under  para  276B,  I  would  allow  her  appeal  under   the
    Immigration Rules.

19. This is relevant to the balancing exercise in  relation  to  Article  8
    outside the Rules, although the  type  and  duration  of  leave  to  be
    granted is a matter for the respondent given that  the  appellant  only
    has the human rights ground of appeal.

20. For the reasons given above,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  decision  is
    disproportionate. I therefore allow the  appellant's  appeal  on  human
    rights grounds outside the Rules (Article 8).

Decision

The decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Haria involved  the  making
of a material error of law such that her decision to dismiss the  appeal  on
human rights grounds (Article 8) is set aside. Her decision to  dismiss  the
appeal under the Immigration Rules stands.

The Upper Tribunal has proceeded to re-make the decision on the  appellant's
appeal against the respondent's decision. Her appeal  is  allowed  on  human
rights grounds outside the Rules (Article 8).
