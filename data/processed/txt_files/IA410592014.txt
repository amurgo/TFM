basis
For the Respondent:    Mr S Staunton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS



 1. I shall refer to  the  parties  as  they  were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, thus the Secretary of State is the Respondent and Mr Ahmad is
    once more the Appellant.

 2. This is an appeal by the Respondent against the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Khawar (the judge), promulgated on  14  March  2016,  in
    which he allowed the Appellant's appeal under  the  Immigration  Rules.
    This appeal has a somewhat protracted procedural history.  In  summary,
    the Respondent's  original  decision  in  respect  of  the  Appellant's
    application for further leave to remain was made on 26 September  2014.
    The Appellant's initial appeal came before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Cooper, and by a decision promulgated on 28 April 2015 he dismissed the
    appeal.  That decision was then successfully challenged  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Deputy Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Archer  finding  there  to  be
    material errors of law and then remitting the matter back to the First-
    tier Tribunal for a  complete  re-hearing.   In  this  way  the  appeal
    eventually came before the judge on 20 January 2016.

 3. The Appellant's case involved the now very well-known  ETS  issues.  In
    particular the Respondent has asserted throughout  that  the  Appellant
    obtained his English language certificate through deception and that  a
    proxy test taker was involved in the obtaining of the certificate  back
    in 2012.




The judge's decision

 4. The judge begins his findings and conclusions at paragraph 15.  He sets
    out the assertions made in the refusal letter and  refers  to  what  he
    describes as the "generic evidence"  relied  upon  by  the  Respondent,
    namely witness statements from  Miss  Rebecca  Collings  and  Mr  Peter
    Millington.  The judge goes on to note the absence  of  other  specific
    evidence from the Respondent, and at paragraph 23 the judge  states  as
    follows:-

         "... on the totality of the aforesaid evidence before me, I am  not
         satisfied that the Respondent has discharged the  burden  of  proof
         upon her to establish that the Appellant has used deception ...".

 5. At paragraph 24 the judge refers  to  what  he  finds  to  be  credible
    evidence from the Appellant contained  in  two  witness  statements,  a
    number of documents, and oral evidence.  On the basis of these findings
    the appeal was duly allowed.




The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 6. The Respondent's grounds of appeal are in essence twofold.  First, that
    the judge had failed to set out what evidence from  the  Appellant  the
    judge had deemed to be credible, with particular reference to paragraph
    24.  Second, that the judge had applied a standard of proof higher than
    that of the balance of probabilities.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Upper Tribunal Judge  Jackson,  by  a
    decision dated 17 March 2017, found the first ground  to  be  arguable,
    but the second to lack in any merit at all.

The hearing before me

 8. At the outset of the hearing I indicated to the parties that I had read
    what I regarded to be the relevant  case  law  pertaining  to  the  ETS
    issues, the Record of Proceedings from the hearing  before  the  judge,
    and the two witness statements referred  to  in  paragraph  24  of  his
    decision.  I also indicated  that  if  the  judge  had  approached  the
    relevant issues correctly and that if the Appellant's evidence had been
    sufficient to support a conclusion that he  had  provided  a  plausible
    rebuttal to the Respondent's  allegations,  then  the  judge  was  also
    probably entitled to conclude that the  Respondent's  generic  evidence
    was insufficient to discharge  the  legal  burden  resting  upon  (with
    regard to the case of Qadir in both the Upper  Tribunal  and  Court  of
    Appeal).

 9. Mr Staunton relied on the first ground of appeal, did not seek  to  re-
    open the second ground of appeal and had nothing further  to  add.   Mr
    Turner submitted that there are  no  material  errors  of  law  in  the
    judge's decision.




Decision on error of law

10. As I announced to the parties at the hearing I conclude that there  are
    no material errors of law in the judge's decision.

11. It is right that the decision could have been structured in  a  clearer
    manner,  but  that  is  really  by-the-by:  substance  is  always  more
    important than form.  Having read the judge's decision holistically and
    in a sensible manner, I conclude that his reference in paragraph 23  to
    a failure by the Respondent to discharge the burden of proof relates to
    the ultimate legal burden and not the  initial  evidential  burden.   I
    would conclude that by way of  implication  the  judge  has  in  effect
    accepted that the generic evidence  was  sufficient  to  overcome  that
    initial evidential burden, albeit he has not said so in express  terms.
    I read paragraph 23 in that way because at paragraph 24 the judge  goes
    on to refer to the Appellant's evidence in rebuttal and deems  this  to
    be credible.  Thus the judge was, in my view, proceeding in effect,  if
    not entirely by design, in an appropriate manner.  As I have  mentioned
    previously, once the judge (assuming he was entitled to) concluded that
    the Appellant's rebuttal was credible, he was then entitled to conclude
    that  the  generic  evidence  relied  upon  by   the   Respondent   was
    insufficient to discharge the legal burden of proof (see SM  and  Qadir
    in the Upper Tribunal  and  paragraph  23  of  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    judgment in Qadir).

12. The question arises as to whether the judge was  entitled  to  conclude
    that the Appellant's evidence was credible.  It is right that  he  does
    not set out this evidence when making his  findings  in  paragraph  24.
    That is somewhat unfortunate as where particular factual issues are  of
    essential importance to an  appeal,  the  recitation  of  the  relevant
    evidence will always be helpful to those  reading  the  decision  at  a
    later date.  Having said that, reference to  the  Appellant's  evidence
    and the essence of  its  contents  is  made  in  paragraph  13  of  the
    decision.  I have looked at the two witness statements referred  to  in
    paragraph 24 and in relation to the first witness  statement  dated  10
    March 2015 it is right that a degree of detail as to the  circumstances
    surrounding  the  relevant  English  test  has  been  provided  by  the
    Appellant.  I have also looked at the Record of Proceedings produced by
    the judge at the hearing.  There is clear  reference  to  a  number  of
    questions  being  put  in  cross-examination  about  the  circumstances
    surrounding the relevant test.  As far as I can see, the oral  evidence
    was consistent with the written evidence and taking an overall view  of
    the evidence the judge was, in my view, entitled to conclude  that  the
    Appellant had indeed provided a credible rebuttal to  the  Respondent's
    allegations.

13. In light of the above, and  whilst  the  Appellant  may  appear  to  be
    somewhat fortunate, the judge's findings and conclusions were  open  to
    him and therefore the decision stands.
