For the Appellant:           Mr Lewis,  Counsel instructed by Wilson
Solicitors LLP
For the Respondent:    Ms Jones, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Nigeria born in 1974. He appeals against
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge S.Y Loke) to dismiss his
    appeal on protection and human rights grounds.








 2. That appeal before the First-tier Tribunal was against the Respondent's
    decision of the 22nd November 2017  to  deport  the  Appellant  on  the
    grounds that he is a  serious  criminal.  Between  2006  and  2016  the
    Appellant accrued 9 convictions for 30 offences - during that period he
    was sent to prison on two occasions, once for 18 months, and on another
    occasion for 6 months. He was served with notification of his liability
    to deportation on the 26th April 2016. Three months later, on the  22nd
    July  2016,  he  was  once  again  convicted,  receiving   16   months'
    imprisonment for various fraud offences. During the  entirety  of  that
    spree the Appellant has never had leave to  remain.  He  came  to  this
    country in 2002 as a student and overstayed his  visa.    Against  that
    background the Respondent argued that it was  strongly  in  the  public
    interest for the Appellant to be deported to Nigeria.

 3. The Appellant's case before the First-tier  Tribunal  rested  on  three
    planks. First, he submitted, he had a genuine and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with his British son, and it would  be  unduly  harsh  for
    that child should his father be removed from the jurisdiction: this was
    the Article 8 ECHR ground.  Second,  he  submitted  that  it  would  be
    contrary to humanitarian principles to  deport  him  because  he  would
    suffer inhumane and degrading treatment in Nigeria, since  he  is  HIV+
    and suffers from sleep apnoea: this was his Article 3 ground.  Finally,
    he argued that he had a well-founded fear of persecution in Nigeria for
    reasons of his membership of a particular social group, viz  homosexual
    men: this was his protection ground.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal found as follows.

 5. In respect of Article 8 the Tribunal accepted that the Appellant has  a
    son in this country and that he has a genuine  relationship  with  that
    child, seeing him once or twice per week.  It does not appear  to  have
    been in issue that the child is  British.    The  Tribunal  found  that
    although the boy  lives  with  his  mother,  his  father  does  have  a
    "relatively significant" role in his life because his  younger  brother
    suffers from ADHD, which requires a lot  of  their  mother's  time  and
    attention.  In light of that the Judge accepted  that  the  Appellant's
    deportation would have a detrimental affect on  his  son.  He  was  not
    however prepared to accept that this harm reached  the  high  threshold
    required to demonstrate that it would be 'unduly harsh' for the boy  to
    remain in this country without his father. The appeal  was  accordingly
    dismissed  on  Article  8  grounds.   Although  those   findings   were
    challenged in the application to appeal to this Tribunal, permission to
    do so was refused by both First-tier Tribunal Judge Ford (2nd September
    2019) and Upper Tribunal Judge Stephen Smith (26th July 2019). Mr Lewis
    did not seek to re-open those findings before me and they are therefore
    to stand.

 6. Whilst the First-tier Tribunal accepted that the Appellant is HIV+  and
    requires medication, it was not satisfied that his removal would result
    in suffering reaching the high threshold required in medical cases: see
    N [2005] UKHL 31. That finding is not challenged and is  to  stand.  Mr
    Lewis did however reserve the  right  to  make  submissions  about  the
    effect of the Appellant's medical needs in the context of any  internal
    flight assessment.

 7. In respect of protection the Tribunal heard evidence from the Appellant
    that he had come to the realisation that he was gay when he  was  still
    at school in Nigeria. He had a number of  sexual  relationships  whilst
    living in Kano. In approximately 2000 the Appellant and  his  boyfriend
    Edgar were arrested in a gay club/cinema; he states that he was  beaten
    up and detained. Upon conviction he  was  sentenced  to  two  years  in
    prison.  It was as a result of this conviction that the family  lost  a
    lot of friends and started to suffer ostracization and abuse.   Edgar's
    family blamed the Appellant and threatened him. When  he  was  released
    his parents suggested that  he  come  to  the  United  Kingdom.     The
    Appellant testified that since he came to this country he  has  managed
    to establish himself 'on the gay scene'.

 8. The First-tier Tribunal rejected that account. Whilst it  accepted  the
    evidence of a doctor that the Appellant had scars because he  had  been
    beaten, it was not prepared to accept that these injuries  occurred  in
    the circumstances described by the Appellant. It found there  to  be  a
    number of significant discrepancies in the account. These included:

               . Whether his first homosexual experiences  (with  an  older
                 boy at school) were consensual or not [FTT �25]
               . That the Appellant failed to mention Edgar - or an earlier
                 lover Coleman - in his witness statement [�26-27]
               . What the length of his prison sentence was [�28]
               . Whether his mother knew why he was arrested [�29(a)]
               . Why his siblings would not want to know the reason for his
                 detention [�29(b)]
               . When and whether the mother of his son was  aware  of  his
                 sexual orientation [�29(c)/(d)]

    The Tribunal further commented that there was no corroborative evidence
    to support the Appellant's claims, and taking all of that into account,
    found him to have failed to discharge the burden of proof.


 9. In appealing to this Tribunal the Appellant submits, and has permission
    to argue, that in  reaching  those  adverse  credibility  findings  the
    Tribunal made  mistakes  of  fact  which  fundamentally  undermine  its
    conclusions.  That was the issue  before  me  at  the  'error  of  law'
    hearing on the 29th August 2019.






    Error of Law

10. The Appellant's evidence  was  set  out  before  the  Tribunal  in  the
    following documents:


              i) Handwritten letter  drafted  by  Appellant  dated  the  4th
                 November 2016 [annex N Respondent's bundle]
             ii) Screening interview dated the 28th June 2017 [annex P]
            iii) Asylum interview dated 17th August 2017 [annex Q]
             iv)  Typed  witness  statement   submitted   under   cover   of
                 solicitor's letter dated the 18th August 2017  [annex  R99-
                 R134]
              v) Further typed statement dated the 16th March 2019 [pages 17-
                 50 Appellant's bundle


11. Mr Lewis explained that the item at (i) was written  by  the  Appellant
    without the benefit of legal advice or assistance,  whilst  he  was  in
    detention, the day after he had claimed asylum. It was written  by  him
    to supplement what is referred  to  in  the  Respondent's  index  as  a
    'preliminary information form'.


12. At paragraphs 26-27 of its decision the First-tier Tribunal says this:

         "26. The Appellant's account regarding Edgar is  also  problematic.
         In his statement at RB-R99 the Appellant states that he  was  in  a
         relationship with Edgar for 2 years prior to his arrest. Previously
         he was in a relationship with a male called Coleman for 2 years. In
         interview the Appellant confirms that it was due  to  being  caught
         with Edgar in a cinema that led to his conviction for homosexuality
         in 1999/2000 (Q50). The Appellant stated  that  Edgar  admitted  to
         their homosexual relationship, which led to  more  intense  torture
         (Q54). The Appellant also states in his interview  that  he  feared
         reprisals from Edgar's family (Q77). Crucially in my view, there is
         absolutely no mention of Coleman or Edgar at all in the Appellant's
         statement of 4  November  2016  at  RB-N10.  This  is  despite  the
         Appellant giving an account of his more casual  relationships  with
         men he met at the red light district.  I  would  expect  that  both
         Coleman and Edgar would have been mentioned in the circumstances.


         27. Even more surprisingly, in the  2016  statement  the  Appellant
         gives an account of his arrest at a gay cinema and makes absolutely
         no mention of Edgar at all.   Given the significance  of  Edgar  in
         the Appellant's life at the time,  and  the  fact  that  they  were
         arrested together, Edgar's confession and  the  problems  that  the
         Appellant faced from Edgar's family, I find it incredible  that  he
         is not mentioned at all in the 2016 statement.   When  this  lacuna
         was put to the Appellant his response was simply that he could  not
         remember why he did not mention Edgar. I  find  this  inconsistency
         has not been adequately addressed and that it again goes to a  core
         plank of the Appellant's case and damages his credibility".


         (emphasis added)


13. Mr Lewis submitted that the Tribunal made two errors of  fact  in  this
    analysis. The first is that Coleman is specifically  mentioned  in  the
    2016 statement. The second is that although it is correct to  say  that
    Edgar is not named, it is clear from the statement that  the  Appellant
    was arrested with  at  least  one  other  individual.  Given  that  the
    statement was a preliminary statement of case, drafted in person from a
    cell, and that Edgar features  in  all  subsequent  statements  of  the
    evidence, the Tribunal erred in failing  to  take  those  matters  into
    account when it weighs against him the failure to mention the detail of
    Edgar's name.


14. I am satisfied that the Tribunal did err in fact at  its  paragraph  26
    when it finds that Coleman is not mentioned in the Appellant's November
    2016 statement. At N11 of that statement the Appellant states  that  he
    had a "secret gay relationship"  during  his  university  days  with  a
    "friend called Coleman".

15. The reference to Edgar is not so specific:

         "In the year 1999 a very huge anti-homosexual raid was launched  at
         a favourite gay cinema in Kano called Marhaba cinema.  The  Islamic
         police called Hisbah committee came there with members of the state
         police and anti robbery squad. I was present at this raid  and  was
         arrested for homosexual activities.


         We were taken to the headquarters of the state security service....


16. Whilst I agree with the Respondent that this section does not expressly
    mention Edgar I am prepared to accept that it is  a  reference  to  the
    Appellant being arrested with  another  person.  This  was  an  initial
    statement and I note that much of it is concerned not with past  events
    in Nigeria, but with the Appellant's lifestyle since he arrived in  the
    United Kingdom. In the circumstances it is unsurprising that he did not
    record all of the details  that  might  later  assume  significance.  I
    further note that the terms  in  which  the  Appellant  here  expresses
    himself are mirrored in his asylum interview, some 9 months  later  [at
    Q50 AIR]:


         "Around 99/00 I was arrested for being in a gay club/cinema with  a
         guy I was seeing at the time, Edgar....


         We were taken to HQ state security service of the NGA police"


17. I am therefore satisfied that the Tribunal did make a mistake  of  fact
    about the contents of the November 2016 statement. The question remains
    whether that is an error such that the decision must be set aside.


18. Mr Melvin, who represented the Respondent at the hearing  on  the  29th
    August, pointed to the various other credibility points  taken  by  the
    Tribunal against the Appellant. He rightly submitted that this was only
    one amongst several matters that the Tribunal found  to  weigh  against
    the Appellant in its assessment of his credibility. I have  taken  that
    into account. I am however satisfied that in this particular  case  the
    errors of fact do go to the heart of the Tribunal's findings,  and  for
    that reason the decision (insofar as it relates to protection) must  be
    set aside.  I so find first because the Tribunal itself makes it  clear
    that these adverse points were central to its  assessment:  Judge  Loke
    describes the failure to mention the names as "crucial" and  "core"  to
    the case.  Second, it is axiomatic that where one element of a  rounded
    credibility assessment is set  aside  it  is  very  difficult,  if  not
    impossible, to safely extract the remaining findings  intact:  see  for
    instance Tewedros Tadesse Haile v Immigration  Appeal  Tribunal  [2001]
    EWCA Civ 663 [at �25]. All of the remaining points relied  upon  by  Mr
    Melvin could, for instance, have gone the other way  had  the  Tribunal
    been satisfied that the core  of  the  account  had  been  consistently
    expressed from day one.


19. In my written decision of the 30th August  2019  I  therefore  set  the
    decision, insofar as  it  relates  to  the  protection  claim  and  the
    Appellant's claimed sexuality, aside to be remade. Since the  remainder
    of the First-tier  Tribunal  findings  remain  undisturbed  I  did  not
    consider that it would be appropriate to remit this matter to the First-
    tier Tribunal.



    The Re-Made Decision

20. The hearing resumed on the 5th November 2019.  The  Appellant  attended
    with four additional witnesses. These witnesses were the mother of  his
    child, plus three friends  who  have  all  known  the  Appellant  since
    childhood. I indicated at  the  hearing  that  I  would  anonymise  the
    identity of these  witnesses,  in  line  with  the  general  order  for
    anonymity made in respect of the  Appellant.  I  will  therefore  refer
    herein to the mother of the Appellant's son as 'M' and to  the  friends
    as F1, F2, and F3.   Each of these  witnesses  were  cross-examined  in
    detail by Ms Jones. I have kept a full verbatim note of their  evidence
    but have not considered it necessary to  reproduce  it  here,  where  I
    shall simply summarise the evidence given.


21. The Respondent confirmed at the outset that the only  matter  in  issue
    was whether the Appellant is gay.  If he is, and the  account  of  past
    persecution is accordingly found to be made out,  then  the  Respondent
    accepted that the appeal must be allowed  on  protection  grounds,  the
    exception to automatic deportation at s33(2)(b) being engaged.

22. The Respondent had produced a detailed refusal letter,  upon  which  Ms
    Jones was able to rely. In essence the decision maker had looked at the
    statements and interviews provided by the Appellant and found  them  to
    contain  material  discrepancies  in  respect  of  when  the  Appellant
    realised he was gay, the extent to which he has lived an outwardly  gay
    lifestyle vis-�-vis his attempts to be 'discreet', and about who in his
    family knew what and when. I accept that the Appellant's  evidence  has
    not been entirely clear. His account, for instance, of his first sexual
    encounter with a boy (an older boy at school) was on the  one  hand  an
    assault (witness statement) and on the other hand consensual (SEF).  He
    claims to live an 'out' lifestyle in London, attending bars  clubs  and
    social events on the 'gay scene', whilst at the same time maintaining a
    level of discretion whilst with his Nigerian friends and associates. He
    was unclear about who exactly his family arranged the  bribe  that  got
    him out of jail in Kano.

23. Having heard from the witnesses I am left in no doubt at all  that  the
    discrepancies and apparent tensions in  the  Appellant's  own  evidence
    arise from the fact that he has, as his close friends consistently  put
    it, spent his entire life pretending to be straight when he is in  fact
    gay. That internal struggle has, perhaps inevitably, led  to  confusion
    in his own mind about his identity, and about certain life  events.   I
    do not regard that tension as being something  capable  of  undermining
    the powerful evidence of the witnesses, in particular that  of  F1,  F2
    and F3.   It is perfectly plausible that the  Appellant  behaves  in  a
    discreet way amongst some of his  friends,  whilst  at  the  same  time
    feeling able to be open about his sexuality in other circles. The  fact
    that he has that freedom in London is what permits him to express  that
    innate characteristic, and to give him the opportunity to exercise  his
    core human right to found and have relationships with others.

24. The evidence of the witnesses, upon which I base my  decision,  was  as
    follows.

25. M did not strike me as being a very willing witness. She obviously felt
    uncomfortable discussing matters that were private to her  and  to  the
    Appellant, particularly in such a public forum. She explained that  she
    had met the Appellant through friends and it had  struck  her  from  an
    early stage that he could be gay. That was because of the way  that  he
    carried himself, the way he took care of his appearance  and  the  fact
    that he used cosmetic products, which she found unusual in a man.

26. They did not really ever have a relationship as  such.  It  was  simply
    that she had gone round to where he was living with his mother  to  see
    him because it was his birthday, they had had too much to drink and one
    thing had led to another. She did not really remember  much  about  it.
    She discovered that she was pregnant only five days  later  -  she  was
    having tests done because she was suffering from a urine infection  and
    they told her she was pregnant. She  was  shocked  and  upset.  In  her
    culture you are expected to be married before you have a  baby  so  she
    knew that her family would not be happy. She did in  fact  arrange  for
    the pregnancy to be terminated but the procedure was abandoned  because
    her doctor told her that she had already miscarried. By the  time  that
    she found out that she had not miscarried it was too late.

27. She had no contact with the Appellant at all  when  she  was  pregnant.
    When she was in labour her sister called the Appellant's  mum  and  got
    her to come to the hospital. After the baby was  born  the  Appellant's
    mother had insisted that she and the baby come to live with her. M said
    that this was difficult for the Appellant. He was  extremely  depressed
    and really didn't want to get married. He was  really  struggling  with
    the whole situation. M said that she  didn't  really  care  about  that
    because she had no desire to  marry  him,  but  she  was  furious  with
    herself for being in that situation. They were  both  under  a  lot  of
    pressure from their respective families and it was difficult to  see  a
    way out.

28. One night they had an argument. It was clear he didn't want to be  with
    her and that he felt trapped. He just blurted out that he  couldn't  be
    with her because he was  gay.  Even  though  she  had  always  had  her
    suspicions M was shocked. There  she  was,  sleeping  at  his  mother's
    house, this father of her son, and he had just told  her  that  he  was
    gay. M did not react well to this news. She  did  something  which  she
    really, really now regrets. She went on Facebook and  created  a  false
    profile using the Appellant's details, and announced on the  home  page
    'I am gay". She explained that it was her regret for this action  which
    motivated her to come to the hearing before me. Looking back she  knows
    that she was lashing out because she was in a very difficult  situation
    herself. She was angry with herself for having got into this mess.  She
    knows it was wrong, and very much regrets any  difficulties  that  this
    action caused for the Appellant. Mr  Lewis  confirmed  that  this  fake
    profile was later removed by Facebook at the  Appellant's  request:  he
    directed my attention  to  correspondence  between  the  Appellant  and
    Facebook in respect of that matter.


29. F1 was an impressive an articulate witness  who  answered  all  of  the
    questions put to him in an unhesitant and  straightforward  manner.  He
    has known the Appellant since they were 16 years  old,  having  met  at
    Zaria State university in Nigeria.   He said that at the  time  it  had
    not crossed his mind that the Appellant was gay, since  there  was  "no
    such option" in Nigeria - everyone was  straight.   Looking  back  with
    hindsight, F1 can however say that the  Appellant's  behaviour  at  the
    time was consistent with him struggling with his sexuality. He was tall
    and sporty, so could quite easily have got girls, but he never did.  If
    anything, he appeared to be asexual; other boys regarded him as a  "bit
    of a wimp".

30. The first time that F1 really thought about it was many years later  in
    about 2000. He was living in London at the time and he received a phone
    call from a mutual friend of theirs called Akin. This guy told him that
    the Appellant had been arrested by the Hisbah  force  at  a  cinema  in
    Kano. The information that the Appellant had  been  rounded  up  spread
    quickly - they (i.e. the circle of friends) all knew,  everybody  knew,
    so  did  their  parents.   The  Appellant's  friends   were   extremely
    concerned. It was very bad news. They all knew that this  police  force
    were not known to be a pleasant bunch:  ill  treatment  would  come  as
    standard. They had real doubts about whether the Appellant  would  make
    it out alive. They heard that he was being beaten with electric cables,
    hung upside down and whipped. Ms Jones put it to F1  that  he  had  not
    mentioned this level of ill-treatment in his 2017 letter of support. F1
    explained that as young boys in  Nigeria  they  had  all  been  beaten,
    brutalised, at  school.  It  was  the  way  things  were.  He  had  not
    specifically mentioned hearing about the electric cables  because  that
    was just 'taken as read' with a period of incarceration in  Nigeria  at
    that time.


31. The next time that F1 saw the Appellant they were both  in  London.  It
    was June or July 2002  and  they  were  both  attending  the  'Lovebox'
    festival in Bethnal Green. After this they resumed the friendship  they
    had had in Zaria.  They would see each other  socially  as  part  of  a
    large group of friends. One afternoon in 2010 they had all been out for
    lunch and F1 found himself sitting at the end of the  table,  a  little
    way from the rest of the group, with the Appellant.  He didn't pre-plan
    it but he found himself wanting to let the Appellant know that  it  was
    OK if he was gay, and that he would not judge him. He  didn't  want  to
    come out and say it directly so he just asked him if he had been "doing
    the Vauxhall thing", by which he meant visiting the gay bars and  clubs
    in Vauxhall.   The  Appellant  just  looked  slightly  embarrassed  and
    agreed that he had. F1 left it at that: it was uncomfortable and he did
    not feel the need to make the  Appellant  say  anything  else.  It  was
    understood between them that the Appellant was leading a separate 'out'
    gay life in London, away from his Nigerian friends, and that  this  was
    OK with F1.


32. It was subsequently brought to F1's attention that  the  Appellant  was
    living with another secret that he did  not  want  to  share  with  his
    friends. When he was arrested he had asked another mutual  friend,  F3,
    to go to his flat in London and sort out his stuff. Whilst F3 was there
    he had found a letter from a HIV clinic. F3 called F1 and F2 to discuss
    it.   It was a bit of a blow - in those days a diagnosis like that  was
    a death sentence. The friends were all in shock. They  didn't  want  to
    confront the Appellant, or to let him know that they had obviously come
    across something very personal, but at the same time they wanted him to
    know that they would all be there for him. It was a difficult  decision
    for the group of friends to make, but since he had been sent to  prison
    they decided to leave it for now and  not  say  anything.    They  were
    however extremely worried that he might try and take his own life.

33. F1 was asked to comment on the conclusion reached  by  the  Respondent,
    that the Appellant has invented this account in order  to  avoid  being
    returned to Nigeria. F1 said that he could understand why the  decision
    maker came to that conclusion given the poor choices that the Appellant
    had made (i.e. committing the offences) but ironically it was the other
    way around: the truth is that the Appellant has spent  his  whole  life
    pretending to be straight.  For a Nigerian from Kano to pretend  to  be
    gay was nonsensical - it would be like pretending to be a Jew in  1940s
    Poland. You just wouldn't do it. Nigerian society is so hostile to  the
    notion there is no way that someone would expose  themselves  to  that.
    Ms Jones put it to F1 that the fact that the Appellant had had a  child
    was inconsistent with his claim to  be  a  gay  man.  F1  rejected  the
    suggestion that there was any  inconsistency.  In  a  society  such  as
    Nigeria, where being openly gay simply isn't an option,  most  gay  men
    are married with children.


34. F2 is a medical doctor practising in the United Kingdom.   He is  a  GP
    and  in  his  evidence  in  chief  confirmed  that  he  understood  the
    importance of telling the truth. I accept that F2 is plainly  aware  of
    his responsibility to this court and to his professional body, and this
    fortified my conclusion that  he  was  a  wholly  credible  and  honest
    witness.

35. F2 has known the Appellant since they were schoolboys - about 30 years.
     He has had contact with him intermittently since then but now  regards
    him as a good friend. F2 did not give evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal because the Appellant did not ask him. He  had  however  taken
    the day of from  work  to  attend  today  because  he  understands  how
    important it is.

36. F2 spoke in very similar terms to F1 about the 'unsaid' knowledge  that
    this group of friends  have  had  -  they  have  long  known  that  the
    Appellant is gay, and that he is HIV+, but they  have  never  felt  the
    need to tell him that they knew, nor for him to  confirm  it  to  them.
    They have just got along as friends. F2's evidence mirrored that of  F1
    in respect of the friends'  discovery  that  the  Appellant  was  HIV+.
    Whilst sharing a flat with the Appellant he had  used  the  Appellant's
    laptop one day and seen lots  of  screens  open  on  gay  dating/escort
    websites. This had confirmed for him what he  already  suspected.    F2
    has never known the Appellant to be in a relationship with a woman, nor
    even to show an interest - he was surprised when he had a child. F2 was
    not however surprised that the Appellant has behaved in the way he  has
    over the years, in keeping  his  sexuality  hidden  from  his  Nigerian
    friends: "he has struggled with social norms  and  expectations  for  a
    long time. It is no surprise to me that he  would  attempt  to  live  a
    'normal' life - to fit it with Nigerian  society",  particularly  after
    what happened to him.  That brings me to the most  significant  element
    of F2's evidence: his confirmation that in 1999/2000 the Appellant  was
    imprisoned in Nigeria.

37. F2 had heard about the Appellant's arrest in the Marhaba cinema in  the
    same way as F1 - he had received a telephone call  from  mutual  friend
    F3.  The whole town was aware of it- news like  that  spreads  quickly.
    F2 was told that the Appellant and his friend Edgar had been picked  up
    with others at the Marhaba. This was a venue which screened films a few
    nights a week. Lots of Indigenes went there but it was also known to be
    a "gay hang-out".  Looking back on it F1 believes  that  the  Appellant
    and Edgar were in a relationship.

38. F2 had been living in Lagos at the time. When he had gone back to  Kano
    to visit his family  he  decided  to  go  and  see  the  Appellant.  He
    described the visit as follows:

         "He was in Kano city prison. I saw him in the visitor's room. He
         was wearing flipflops, a t-shirt and shorts. He looked dishevelled.
         He had bruises on his face and on his leg a healing scar. He lost
         quite a bit of weight. He showed me a wound on his chest which
         looked like a healing burn. He told me it was a cigarette burn"

39. Ms Jones put it to F2 that this level of detail had been  omitted  from
    the letter that had served as his witness statement. F2 readily  agreed
    that this was the case, but he had mentioned that he had  been  to  see
    him in Kano at that time.   Like F1, F2 did not regard  the  fact  that
    the Appellant had  been  ill  treated  as  remarkable:  it  was  to  be
    expected.


40. F3 is a Deputy Headteacher living and working in London.  I found F3 to
    be a credible and compelling witness, who understood his obligation  to
    uphold his professional standing, and to be a witness of truth to  this
    Tribunal.

41. F3 has known the Appellant longest of all. They were neighbours in Kano
    growing up, and he has known the Appellant since they  were  about  six
    years old.  Obviously as a young child it had not crossed his mind that
    the Appellant might be gay, but looking back on it he can see that  the
    Appellant was different. As a young boy he always preferred the company
    of  girls.  Older  kids  in  the  neighbourhood  called  the  Appellant
    'Lollipop' which F3 also adopted as a nickname for him too. It was only
    later that he came to understand that this was  in  fact  a  homophobic
    slur - a derogatory term for someone "to be licked".  F3 expressed  his
    regret for his part in the teasing and name-calling that the  Appellant
    was subjected to growing up.

42. As they entered their teens the Appellant was very sporty and athletic.
    Girls were clearly interested in him but  this  was  not  reciprocated.
    This was something that F3 had observed at the time but the reason  why
    had not occurred to him: "you have to  understand  the  environment  we
    were in it certainly would not be a conversation you would have".

43. As they grew older the possibility  that  the  Appellant  was  gay  had
    occurred to F3 but it was only when he was arrested that  F3  knew  for
    sure.   F3 found out when he received a telephone call from his  mother
    - she told him that the Appellant had been arrested  for  indecency  in
    the Marhaba cinema. She said that "I needed to think about the kind  of
    friends I was keeping". It was a real shock that he had  been  arrested
    like that.

44. F3's evidence about the  Appellant's  current  behaviour  was  entirely
    consistent with that given by F1 and F2. Whilst it is his understanding
    that the Appellant goes out in London and thus lives a "gay lifestyle",
    this is not something that they would, as Nigerian men, really discuss.
    They all know obviously, but they don't  see  the  need  to  force  the
    Appellant to discuss it - it doesn't need to be said. As  to  the  Home
    Office concern that the Appellant  got  a  woman  pregnant,  F3  stated
    bluntly that this was irrelevant. It made  no  impact  at  all  on  his
    belief that the Appellant is a gay man.   There are plenty of  Nigerian
    men who are gay but are  married  with  a  full-blown  family.  In  his
    concluding remarks F3 said this:

         "I wouldn't come here and lie. He has made poor choices. We have
         held him to task about that. In terms of his sexuality - it is what
         it is".

45. The force of this oral evidence was compelling. These three men, all of
    whom are professionals resident in the United Kingdom, who  have  known
    the Appellant for many years,  were  in   no  doubt  at  all  that  the
    Appellant is gay; nor did any of them have any doubt  that  it  is  his
    life in London which enables him to express his sexuality in a way that
    he simply could not safely do in Nigeria.  Although  each  witness  was
    subject to detailed and persistent cross examination by Ms Jones, their
    evidence was wholly consistent and credible. I therefore find  as  fact
    that the Appellant is a gay man who has suffered persecution  for  that
    reason, in the  form  of  incarceration,  torture,  discrimination  and
    social ostracization.  Before me  Ms  Jones  confirmed  that  the  only
    matter in issue was the Appellant's claimed sexuality: if the Appellant
    can prove that he is gay, his appeal should be  allowed.   That  burden
    having been discharged,  the  appeal  must  be  allowed  on  protection
    grounds.  I am satisfied that this is the appropriate outcome: this  is
    an Appellant who expresses his sexual  identity  by  leading  an  'out'
    life, a life that he could not lead in  Nigeria  for  fear  of  renewed
    persecution.



    Anonymity

46. This decision discloses that the Appellant is living with HIV. As  such
    I am satisfied,  having had regard to the guidance in the  Presidential
    Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders, that  at  this  stage  it
    would be appropriate to make an order in accordance with Rule 14 of the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 in the following terms:


        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him, any of his witnesses  or
        any member of his  family.   This  direction  applies  to,  amongst
        others, both the Appellant and the Respondent.  Failure  to  comply
        with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decision

47. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set  aside  to  the  limited
    extent identified above.


48. There is an order for anonymity.

49. The appeal is allowed on protection grounds.
