Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms G Thomas of Counsel instructed by Spence & Horne
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica, born on 6 April 1974.

2.   He came to the United Kingdom  in  2002  and  remained  with  leave  in
    various capacities.  In March 2006 he made a successful application for
    a certificate of approval for marriage and indeed married in accordance
    with that certificate.

3.   On 16 July 2009 he was  convicted  for  supplying  class  A  controlled
    drugs, namely crack cocaine  and  heroin.   In  November  2009  he  was
    sentenced to five years and five months' imprisonment  with  a  release
    date of 2 April 2011.

4.   By letter of 23 August 2012 the appellant was notified that he was  the
    subject of deportation  proceedings  under  Section  32(5)  of  the  UK
    Borders Act 2007.  He was notified of his right to appeal against  that
    decision, which right was exercised.

5.   Thus it was that his appeal came for hearing  before  Designated  Judge
    Peart and Miss Endersby (Non Legal Member) on 18  December  2012.   The
    basic nature of the appeal was that his removal from the United Kingdom
    would be in breach of his protected human rights under Article 8 of the
    ECHR.  The appeal was allowed.

6.   The respondent sought to appeal against that decision,  essentially  on
    the basis that the Tribunal failed to consider  adequately  the  public
    interest in the removal of the appellant  and  had  failed  to  provide
    adequate reasons for its findings in  the  proportionality  assessment.
    Leave to appeal was granted on those grounds.

7.   The matter came before me for hearing on 3 April 2013.

8.   On that occasion I heard  argument  on  the  issue.   The  respondent's
    position was that this particular offence was so serious and  revolting
    that the public interest was served by the removal  of  the  appellant,
    notwithstanding the distress which such is undoubtedly going  to  cause
    to the family, and to Amira in particular.  It was  to  be  noted  that
    thus was an offence of drug dealing preying upon vulnerable people by a
    person seeking to make money who was not himself the user of drugs.  As
    was made clear in  the  sentencing  remarks,  some  �5,500  was  seized
    together with an array of electronic equipment.  There were a number of
    individuals involved in the conspiracy although  the  sentencing  judge
    could not determine as to hierarchy.

9.   The difficulty with that particular determination of the  Tribunal  was
    that it focused more upon risk and  rehabilitation  than  the  need  to
    deter and express revulsion.  It did not as such  recognise  explicitly
    the significant public interest in securing removal.

10.  I found that the Tribunal had not  applied  the  proper  balance.   The
    greater the importance of removal, the stronger the reasons need to  be
    as to why that would be disproportionate in the  circumstances  of  the
    appellant.

11.  In the circumstances therefore I found there to be a material error  of
    law such that the decision should be set aside and re-made.

12.  Thus it was that the matter came before me on 29 August 2013  for  that
    re-hearing to be conducted.  Ms Thomas, who represents  the  appellant,
    had represented him before me on the previous occasion.  Mr Jarvis, who
    represented the respondent, had  also  been  present  on  the  previous
    hearing before me.

13.  A preliminary issue arose as to whether or not  it  was  necessary  for
    further oral evidence to be given.  Mr Jarvis invited me to  find  that
    it was unnecessary to do so in the light of the fact that  he  did  not
    challenge much of the evidential material that had been  placed  before
    the Tribunal on a previous occasion.  Ms Thomas invited me to say  that
    it was always important to clarify certain matters and to  expand  upon
    them.  She did not intend to call a great deal of oral evidence but was
    anxious that all matters were properly considered.

14.  It seemed to me  that  in  the  interests  of  justice  and  given  the
    importance of the decision to the lives of the appellant and to all his
    family,  relevant oral evidence could properly be given.

15.  Ms Thomas relied upon the material that had been previously before  the
    court together with her skeleton argument.

16.  The appellant gave evidence.  He adopted his statement of  10  December
    2010 with attachments.

17.  He married on 24 June 2006 and Amira was born on 26 January 2009.

18.  During 2008 he was unemployed and finding it difficult to  get  a  job.
    As finances were limited he involved himself with drugs.

19.  He was arrested on 16 July  2008  and  remanded  in  custody.   He  was
    convicted in July 2009 and released from custody on  licence  in  2011.
    The licence expires at the end of this year.  Thus it  was  that  Amira
    was born whilst he was in custody, he was not able to be with  her  for
    the first two years of her life.

20.  He finds it difficult not being able to work but  spends  his  time  at
    home, giving support to his wife and to Amira.

21.  Whilst in prison  he  passed  various  certificates  for  plumbing  and
    engineering.  He worked as a Samaritan.  It is his hope to  finish  his
    plumbing course at Southgate College by completing a  City  and  Guilds
    course so to qualify.  He would like to volunteer  his  services  as  a
    Samaritan.

22.  The various City and Guilds certificates which he passed in prison  are
    enclosed with his statement.

23.  He said that he missed his family very much and now enjoys  being  with
    them.  He spoke of the attachment of Amira to him.   His  wife  is  now
    pregnant and  is  experiencing  difficulties  in  the  course  of  that
    pregnancy.

24.  He agreed with Mr Jarvis that when he had been dealing in drugs he  had
    not been a drug user himself.  He had operated from a different address
    so as not to  involve  his  family.   He  said  that  his  attitude  to
    offending was quite different, he having experienced custody and having
    undertaken a number of courses.  He has a better  appreciation  how  to
    deal with issues and wishes to manage his family situation much  better
    in the future.

25.  He agreed that he had family  in  Jamaica  and  had  indeed  worked  in
    Jamaica prior to coming to the United Kingdom.

26.  At present his wife does not work, she having given  up  employment  in
    order to look after Amira and to provide some support for  her  mother.
    He spoke of the fact that his wife had a miscarriage in  2008  and  was
    now five weeks into her second pregnancy.

27.  The appellant's wife, Marsha Emanuel, also gave evidence.  She  adopted
    her statement of 12 December 2012.

28.  She indicated that  whilst  the  appellant  was  in  prison  it  was  a
    difficult time for her.  She visited him as often as she could.

29.  She had been employed with the NatWest Bank for  a  year  dealing  with
    customers over  the  telephone.   She  had  a  diploma  in  information
    technology and also a qualification in business studies.  She  gave  up
    her job in order to look after her daughter but would  wish  to  regain
    employment if she could.  She indeed has an appointment at the  Enfield
    Business Centre on 5 September to discuss an entrepreneurial project.

30.  Prior to the birth of Amira she had had a miscarriage.  Amira was  born
    prematurely.  Currently, she experiences hormonal difficulties  in  the
    pregnancy which requires her  to  have  frequent  blood  tests  at  the
    hospital.  Indeed she was admitted to hospital over the  past  weekend,
    having been admitted on Friday and released on Monday.  It was a matter
    of concern.

31.  She found it very difficult to cope as a  virtual  single  mother  with
    looking after Amira.  In addition, her mother had health  problems  and
    this required her to go and visit her two or  three  times  a  week  in
    order to do the cooking, make the beds and generally assist her mother.
     An additional complication now was that her brother,  who  lives  with
    her mother, has been diagnosed with a form of  psychosis.   She  has  a
    sister who lives nearby who also provides assistance to her mother.

32.  She spoke of the great bond  that  had  been  established  between  the
    appellant and Amira, such that Amira often clings to him and  does  not
    want to let him out of her sight.  He plays constantly with her and  is
    a constant companion in the home.  She does not know how she would cope
    emotionally were he to be removed from the  family.   In  reply  to  Mr
    Jarvis she said that if she got any indication that the  appellant  had
    returned to drug dealing she  would  divorce  him  and  take  away  the
    children from him.

33.  Marvia Edwards also gave evidence.  She adopted  her  statement  of  12
    December 2012.  She is the appellant's mother-in-law.  Since  2007  she
    has been on incapacity benefit because she  suffers  from  a  fractured
    neck bone which presses upon nerves in her neck and arm.   Although  it
    is possible for that condition to be corrected it involves surgery  and
    there is a very  considerable  risk  in  that  procedure.   She  is  in
    constant pain and finds it difficult to operate  her  right  arm.   She
    lives in her own home with her son and depends significantly  upon  her
    two daughters who help her.  Essentially, Marsha does all  the  cooking
    for her, putting the food cooked in bulk in suitable  containers.   She
    makes the bed, helps her dress on  occasions  and  generally  does  the
    shopping.

34.  She too spoke of the bond that exists between the appellant and  Amira.
     She described the games that they play together and the response which
    she makes to her father.  He plays with Amira for hours.

35.  It is right to note that all three witnesses and Amira were present  at
    one stage in the hearing room and I had the  opportunity  of  observing
    the girl hugging both her mother and her father.  There is no reason to
    doubt the nature of the affection that has been described.

36.  Having heard evidence from Marsha Emanuel I formed the impression  that
    she was a very straightforward person who had a realistic grasp of  the
    family situation as was someone who was determined, with the  appellant
    to improve that situation.  She was also somebody clearly committed  to
    helping her wider family, in particular her mother.

37.  There were four defendants who fell to be sentenced for their  part  in
    the conspiracy to supply drugs.  I note in  particular  the  sentencing
    remarks of His Honour, Judge Sheridan, at the Wood Green Crown Court on
    11 November 2009.  One of the defendants was the launderer, three  were
    the suppliers involved in the conspiracy.  They were all from  Jamaica,
    none were drug addicts.  Thus this  was  an  offence  operated  through
    greed for profit and easy money.

38.  It was a conspiracy that had lasted a little over 60 days.   The  judge
    was unable to determine, with accuracy,  the  hierarchy,  although  his
    suspicions leant more towards the appellant as the control. Such a view
    was not reflected in the sentence as all were  dealt  with  equally  in
    terms of their role.

39.  It would seem that the basis for the conspiracy was  that  there  would
    be telephone contact made for the  supply  of  drugs  which  were  then
    supplied.  Between 15 May 2008 and 16 July 2008 some 12,934 phone calls
    had been accepted by a particular sim card.  It  seemed  to  the  Judge
    therefore that the conspirators were working on average a sixteen  hour
    day, supplying class A drugs to the streets of London.  So far  as  the
    launderer was concerned, �18,980 and �31,000 were recovered.  So far as
    the appellant  was  concerned  he  was  arrested  at  the  address  and
    headquarters of the conspiracy with cash of �5,500.24.   Significantly,
    he had a piece of paper bearing the number which was used  to  ring  to
    order drugs.  One of the defendants had �1,100 in cash and  a  quantity
    of drugs and another had �3,859.63.

40.  The appellant was sentenced, upon a late guilty  plea,  to  five  years
    and five months.

41.  According to the OASys Report the appellant  is  at  low  risk  of  re-
    offending.  The report indicates that he has taken  responsibility  for
    his crime and has undergone training and work  in  the  course  of  his
    imprisonment.

42.   Clearly,  the   report   recognises   that   financial   difficulties,
    unemployment and relationship breakdown are all factors which may serve
    to  increase  risk.   Employment,  supervision  and  increasing  victim
    empathy may serve to reduce it.

43.  The report indicates that the objective of  improving  thinking  skills
    has been fully achieved,  as  indeed  has  that  of  enhanced  thinking
    skills.   That objective being an  increased  understanding  of  likely
    consequences for self or  others  of  offending,  the  appellant  being
    supervised by weekly appointments.

44.  The appellant insisted in response to Mr Jarvis's question that he  has
    become very much aware of the errors of his actions and of  the  effect
    that drugs have on  other  people.   In  that  connection  I  note  the
    statement of 10 December 2012, which says  that  as  a  result  of  his
    limited finances he was forced to seek alternative means.   No  one  of
    course forces another to supply drugs.  That remark raises the question
    as to whether or not the appellant has fully embraced the nature of his
    activities.  As Mr Jarvis indicates,  there  is  perhaps  a  degree  of
    artificiality in assessing risk at a time when the  appellant  is  both
    seeking to remain in the United Kingdom and is  under  supervision  for
    his offending.  Nevertheless, in fairness to the appellant, he has been
    away from custody for some two years and has not re-offended.

45.  I take account of the most recent documents that were presented for  my
    attention, in particular a letter from Darren Malcolm, a family friend,
    speaking of him as being a good father  and  a  devout  husband.   Some
    letters and documents from the Barnet and Chase Farm  Hospital  support
    the contention that there is another baby on the way,  of  five  weeks'
    gestation. It is clear that the  appellant's  wife  is  unwell  and  as
    advised remains close to hospital; they relate to her admission  on  23
    August 2013 and discharge on 26 August 2013.

46.  Mr Jarvis invited my attention to the decision of the Court  of  Appeal
    in RU (Bangladesh) [2011] EWCA Civ 65.  Paragraph 33 of that  judgement
    highlighted the important facets of the public interest  as  identified
    in OH (Serbia).  Those facets identified in deportation cases involving
    non-British citizens were:-

         (a)  the risk of offending by the person concerned;


         (b)  the need to deter foreign nationals  from  committing  serious
             crimes by  leading  to  understand  that  whatever  the  other
             circumstances,  one  consequence   of   them   may   well   be
             deportation; and


         (c)   the  role  of  deportation  as  an  expression  of  society's
             revulsion at serious crimes and in building public  confidence
             in the  treatment  of  foreign  citizens  who  have  committed
             serious crimes.


47.  Mr Jarvis invited my attention to his bundle  prepared  to  assist  the
    court.

48.  In effect Mr Jarvis makes two main  points.   The  first  is  that  the
    presence of a child is an important factor  which  requires  a  nuanced
    approach but which does not of itself serve to defeat deportation.

49.  In that connection my attention was drawn  to  MK  (best  interests  of
    child) India [2011] UKUT 00475 (IAC).  The  Tribunal  at  paragraph  21
    commented  that  in  deciding  the  best  interests   of   the   child,
    consideration was not to be approached as a simplistic or  reductionist
    exercise.  The best interests of the child   required  a  broad-ranging
    enquiry, encompassing multifarious factors, including the child's  need
    for security, continuity of care and affection and the  opportunity  to
    form long-term attachments based on mutual trust and respect.  The best
    interests of the child were rarely determined by  a  single  overriding
    factor.

50.  In that connection he invited my attention to the  fact  that  for  the
    first two years of her life she had not had the relationship  with  the
    appellant and that such a relationship that now  exists  is  relatively
    short.  She is only 4 years of age.  There is no reason to believe that
    she could not adapt to  the  absence  of  her  father.   Significantly,
    submits Mr Jarvis, she does not know that her father was a drug dealer.
     The question must always arise as to whether it is in the interests of
    a child to have a person such as that as their role model and guide.

51.  Perhaps of more significance is the decision of the Court of Appeal  in
    the case SS (Nigeria) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2013] EWCA Civ 550, in particular judgment by Lord  Justice  Laws.  My
    attention was drawn to what Lord Justice Laws had to say at  paragraphs
    43 and 44 of the judgment:-
         "43. I will next describe two characteristics,  one  positive,  the
             other negative, which the learning shows apply  in  Article  8
             cases involving children. The first is that the  interests  of
             the child or children are a primary consideration. The  second
             (which applies to all removal cases, whether or not there  are
             children) is that there is no rule of  'exceptionality':  that
             is, there is no class of case where the law stipulates that an
             exceptional Article 8 case must be shown  in  some  situations
             but need not be in others.
          1. These two characteristics are vouchsafed by authority  of  the
             House of Lords and the Supreme Court. With great respect  they
             are capable, if not carefully understood, of  investing  child
             cases with a uniform  prevailing  force  which  yields  no  or
             little space  to  the  context  in  hand.  As  for  the  first
             characteristic,  the  key  phrase  is  of  course  'a  primary
             consideration'. It appears in  ZH  and  subsequently,  but  is
             taken from Article 3(1) of the UNCRC, so the choice  of  words
             may be regarded as having particular significance. What  sense
             is to be given to the adjective 'primary'? We know it does not
             mean  'paramount'  -  other  considerations   may   ultimately
             prevail. And the child's interests are not 'the' but only  'a'
             primary consideration - indicating there  may  be  other  such
             considerations which, presumably, may count for as much.  Thus
             the  term  'primary'  seems  problematic.  In  the  course  of
             argument Mr Auburn accepted  that  'a  primary  consideration'
             should  be  taken  to  mean  a  consideration  of  substantial
             importance.  I think that is right.
          1. The second characteristic is that there is no  rule  requiring
             an exceptional case under Article 8 to be  demonstrated.  Here
             there is a risk that the absence of such a rule may appear  to
             suggest that there is a single standard for breach of  Article
             8 which, once met, will carry the claim whatever the  context.
             But that cannot be what  is  meant.  The  public  interest  in
             favour of removal or deportation may be  stronger  or  weaker;
             and accordingly it will  take  more,  or  less,  to  mount  an
             Article 8 claim that will prevail against it."
52.  As is mentioned in paragraph 47 of the judgment, the approach needs  to
    strike two balances, the balance between public  interest  and  private
    right.

53.  As was made clear in paragraph 54 of the judgement:-

         "The pressing  nature  of  the  public  interest  here  is  vividly
         informed by the fact that by Parliament's express  declaration  the
         public interest is injured if the  criminal's  deportation  is  not
         effected.  Such a result could, in my judgment, only  be  justified
         by a very strong claim indeed".

54.  Mr Jarvis submits that accepting  that the  absence  of  the  appellant
    from his family will inevitably cause distress and  difficulties,   his
    private and family concerns need to be balanced with the  wider  public
    interest which has been so clearly expressed in the  Immigration  Rules
    put before Parliament.  The more serious the crime  the  less  easy  it
    will be for a family to claim that removal is disproportionate.

55.   Ms  Thomas,  in  her  submissions,  recognises  the  force  of   those
    judgments.  She invites me to find that the appellant has not  offended
    for many years and in those circumstances the public  interest  may  be
    less served by his removal than otherwise is the case.  I  was  invited
    to find that he was a  good  parent  and  good  husband  and  that  his
    continuing  presence  within  the  family  was  essential   for   their
    continuing wellbeing and function.  I was asked to find that  in  those
    circumstances it was entirely proper that proportionality  be  resolved
    in favour of remaining rather than the appellant's removal.

56.  The decision in MK (best interests of  the  child)  India  [2011]  UKUT
    00475 (IAC) is a useful starting point for  this  determination.   That
    requires a twofold process in  Article  8.   The  first  aspect  is  to
    consider whether or not the appellant meets  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  If not, whether there  are  considerations  outside
    the Rule under Article 8 of the ECHR which  would  provide  the  relief
    sought.

57.  It is not suggesting that the appellant's situation  and  circumstances
    fall either within paragraph 399 or within 399A.  The  focus  therefore
    is upon paragraph 398 that having a sentence  of  over  four  years  it
    would only be in exceptional circumstances that the person's  right  to
    family and private life would outweigh the public  interest  in  seeing
    them deported.  The Rules make it clear that for such  offences  it  is
    clearly in the public interest, subject to  exceptional  circumstances,
    that they be deported.

58.  It is  not  argued  in  this  case  that  there  are  such  exceptional
    circumstances.

59.  The issue therefore to be considered is whether or  not  Article  8  of
    the ECHR is engaged upon  general  principles  that  had  been  applied
    before the Rules came into being.

60.  In MK the appellant, his wife and two children were  citizen  of  India
    and essentially it was found that they may return to live  there.   The
    situation in this appeal is somewhat different as the appellant's  wife
    and children are British  subjects.   Considerations  in  Zambrano  and
    Sanade come into play.

61.  Although  the  initial  refusal  letter  indicated  that  it  would  be
    reasonable to expect them to return to Jamaica with the  appellant,  it
    is not a factor advanced before  me  by  Mr  Jarvis.   He  most  fairly
    accepts that it would not be reasonable to  expect  family  members  to
    relocate to Jamaica, notwithstanding that the appellant's  wife  is  of
    Jamaican origin.

62.  Ms Thomas invites me  to  find  that  the  concept  of  any  meaningful
    contact being maintained as between the appellant, were he removed, and
    his family as somewhat unrealistic in all the circumstances.  Amira  is
    a little girl who wants to be hugged and made the centre  of  attention
    by her father.  Skype and letters would be  of  no  relevance  to  her.
    Although the possibility of visits cannot be ruled out it is  unlikely,
    given the financial situation  and  circumstances  of  the  appellant's
    wife, particularly in looking after her mother and two small  children,
    that that is a realistic possibility.  Essentially therefore, to remove
    the appellant from the jurisdiction, and particularly  for  the  period
    which would need to elapse prior to any application  to  return,  would
    effectively remove the appellant from the life  of  his  family.   That
    would have the result of forcing his wife to choose between her  family
    in the United Kingdom or go with the appellant to Jamaica but  she  has
    no wish to do so and no requirement to go.

63.  There is no issue other than the  appellant  is  a  loving  and  caring
    husband and father and supportive of his family.   The  starting  point
    for any consideration of the best interests of a child is to  recognise
    that, generally speaking, it is in the best interests  of  a  child  to
    have both parents present and supportive.  Equally there may be factors
    which displace that understanding, for example  a  father  who  commits
    crime or is a bad role model, in his case where Parliament has  decreed
    that those  who  commit  serious  crime  should  be  removed  from  the
    jurisdiction.

64.  In balancing the various factors it  cannot  be  said  that  simply  by
    having a child or enjoying family life should defeat removal.  If  that
    were the case there would be little purpose in the  Regulations  having
    been laid before Parliament and approved.  It has been made very  clear
    in the judgment of SS (Nigeria)   that the  more  pressing  the  public
    interest in removal or deportation the stronger must be the claim under
    Article 8 if it is to prevail.

65.  For many foreign criminals they will have a  family  to  love  and  who
    loves them.  It will normally  be  a  particularly  important  part  of
    family life, that upon release from custody, all seek  to  re-make  the
    lives that have been torn apart.  For most foreign criminals there will
    therefore be a period of bonding and relationship building which  would
    be severed by their removal.

66.  Equally, as Ms Thomas submits, it is simply not  sufficient  merely  to
    "rubberstamp" the decision of the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department authorising removal for all  persons  who  fall  within  the
    category envisaged within the Regulations.  There needs to  be  anxious
    consideration of the private and family life in the overall  assessment
    of proportionality, giving due weight to the public  interest  in  that
    analysis, seeking also to give anxious consideration to the welfare  of
    the child. Mr Jarvis invites me to note that in  the  circumstances  of
    this particular family a second child has been conceived at a time when
    the appellant was the subject of deportation.    Apart  from  the  fact
    indeed that Amira  likes  to  be  cuddled  by  her  father  it  is  not
    necessarily a factor determinative of the issue, particularly as she is
    young enough to adapt to changing situations within the household.

67.  Clearly, I also have to bear in mind the  situation  and  circumstances
    which may face the  appellant  upon  return  as  part  of  the  overall
    equation.  In that connection, Mr Jarvis has invited  my  attention  to
    details of the support mechanisms that would be available on return  to
    Jamaica.  In any event, the appellant has family there and  has  worked
    there.  Indeed, as Mr Jarvis remarks, he may have a  better  chance  of
    finding employment in Jamaica than in the United Kingdom.

68.  In this case, although Amira clearly is to be the focus of concern,  it
    is right to note the  dynamics  of  the  family  as  a  whole  and  the
    interests of each member thereof.  Central to that family is of  course
    the appellant's wife.  No criticism or blame attaches to her  for  what
    he did.  Indeed, he kept his activity in a different area and away from
    her knowledge of his actions.  She has sought  in  the  period  of  his
    imprisonment to maintain a family life.  She is someone who herself has
    experienced difficulties.  She had a miscarriage before  the  birth  of
    Amira.  She had to deal with the premature birth of Amira and  she  has
    to  deal  with  the  potential  complications  arising  from  a  second
    pregnancy.  In a few months time she will hopefully have  two  children
    and faces the possibility of being a single mother.   She  herself  has
    the potential to work, as she had worked in the past, and to change the
    dynamics of the family.  She has responsibilities to her mother as well
    as to her daughter.  Her  mother  is  disabled  and  I  have  seen  the
    documents presented.  There is no issue arising to the contrary.  There
    is therefore a marked dynamic of dependency within the family unit, the
    mother depending significantly  upon  her  daughter  and  the  daughter
    seeking some support from her mother and sister.  It was  mentioned  in
    the course of the hearing that her brother also may have  psychological
    problems but that these have not been identified in any clear way.   It
    may be said that the  situation  of  the  appellant's  wife  is  little
    different from other wives who face the absence of their husbands,  but
    in this particular circumstance I find that there is an inter emotional
    dependency within the family as a whole, linked  to  the  emotional  as
    well as the physical need for  the  appellant  being  present  and  the
    support he gives to the family as a whole.  It is a family that has had
    difficulties and has coped but needs stability and support to  maintain
    itself further.

69.  It is also right to note that the appellant's offending was  some  time
    ago.  He has not re-offended.  The offence,  albeit  extremely  serious
    and distressing, was however of relatively short duration  during  that
    two month period.  The offence was committed out  of  greed  which  the
    appellant sincerely regrets.  In terms of deterrent and punishment  the
    appellant received a very substantial prison sentence indeed.

70.  This is not an easy case to determine.  It seems to me, and I so  find,
    that the removal of the appellant would adversely affect the lives  not
    only of Amira but also his wife and her mother and potentially brother-
    in-law to a damaging degree.  As I have indicated I do not detect  from
    their evidence any concealment or lack of candour but rather  a  family
    endeavouring to cope with the situation into which it has been  placed.



71.  The presence of the appellant in the family will bring stability and  a
    chance for a family to be supported and to develop, if not so  much  in
    financial terms but in emotional and human terms.

72.  Doing the best that I can therefore to balance  the  interests  of  the
    family with those of the public  as  so  eloquently  expressed  in  the
    Rules, I find in the circumstances of  this  particular  case,  on  the
    findings of fact which I have made, that removal of the appellant would
    in  the  circumstances  be  disproportionate  and  in  breach  of   the
    fundamental human rights, not  only  of  the  appellant  but  of  those
    emotionally and physically linked with him.

73.  In the circumstances  therefore  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the
    deportation is allowed.  His appeal in respect of Article 8 of the ECHR
    is also allowed.
