                                                                 Respondents
Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Diwncyz
For the Respondent:    No representative

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Cox made following a determination on the papers on 4th July 2016.

 2. The claimants are Pakistani nationals who applied for  visas  to  visit
    the first appellant's brother.  They were  refused  on  27th  September
    2015.  It was said that the claimant's father had died on 2nd September
    2015 and they wished to visit the UK to see  remaining  family  members
    here.  The judge allowed the appeal on Article 8 grounds.

 3. The Secretary of State appealed on the basis that the judge had  failed
    to find that there was any family life for the purposes  of  Article  8
    between the appellants and the sponsor and had wrongly  applied  Abbasi
    and another (visits - bereavement - Article 8) [2015] UKUT 00463  which
    had no application to this case since the claimant's father had died in
    Pakistan.

 4. There was no appearance by the appellants.

 5. I agree with the Secretary of State that the  judge  erred  in  law  in
    allowing the appeal on human rights  grounds  without  first  making  a
    decision as to whether the claimants enjoyed  family  life  with  their
    adult relatives in the UK. Moreover he misapplied the  case  of  Abbasi
    which concerned the visiting of a grave in the UK by family members who
    lived elsewhere.

 6. There was no proper evidence before  the  judge  upon  which  he  could
    decide that family life existed between these adult siblings.

 7. The grounds state that it was unclear as to  whether  the  judge  found
    that the requirements of the Immigration Rules had been met.   That  is
    not correct.  It is quite clear from the judge's reasoning that he  was
    satisfied that the substantive  Rules  were  met  and  he  said  so  at
    paragraph  29  of  his  decision.   It  is  plain  that  there  was   a
    typographical error in the concluding paragraph.

 8. Since the primary facts of the decision are unchallenged  there  is  no
    reason why, if the claimants decided to make  another  application,  it
    would not succeed since the concerns  raised  by  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer were found not to be made out by the judge.

Notice of Decision

 9. The original judge erred in law.  His decision is  set  aside.   It  is
    remade as follows.  The claimants' appeals are dismissed.

10. No anonymity direction is made.
