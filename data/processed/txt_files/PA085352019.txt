Representation:
For the Appellant:      Ms  M.  Cohen,  Counsel,  instructed  by  the  Coram
                    Children's Legal Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr E. Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  a  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Hussain promulgated on 20 November 2020.  The judge dismissed an appeal
    by the appellant, a citizen of Morocco born on 23 August 1999,  against
    a decision of the respondent dated 23 August 2019 to refuse his  asylum
    and humanitarian protection claim, allowing it on human rights grounds.
    There is a cross-appeal by the Secretary of State against the  decision
    to allow the appeal on human rights grounds.

 2. For convenience, I will refer to the appellant  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal as "the appellant", and to  the  respondent/appellant  in  the
    human rights claim appeal as "the Secretary of State".

Factual background

 3. The appellant was born in Italy and lived  there  until  he  was  seven
    years old. He moved  to  Casablanca  with  his  family,  and  later  to
    Marrakesh.  His father died  from  cancer  in  2012.   The  appellant's
    mother and two sisters remain in Morocco.  The appellant  is  still  in
    contact with them.

 4. The appellant claimed to have opened a Facebook account in Morocco,  on
    which he posted content that was insulting to the  monarchy,  and  made
    other anti-government comments. The posts received a lot  of  comments,
    around 90% of which were negative. There were threats that it would  be
    easy to track the appellant down and get rid of him. He later  received
    two anonymous threatening phone calls. He deleted his Facebook  account
    and destroyed his SIM card. He made plans to  leave  Morocco  illegally
    without telling his parents, when he became aware  of  people  who  had
    opposed the government disappearing. He claims that he is on  a  wanted
    list and that he is at risk of being  persecuted  on  his  return.   He
    arrived in this country clandestinely in May 2016, when he was still  a
    child, and claimed asylum in August 2016.

 5. The Secretary of State rejected the appellant's  claim  on  credibility
    grounds, as did the judge below. It is not  necessary  to  outline  the
    judge's credibility findings in any  depth,  as  it  is  common  ground
    between the appellant and the Secretary of State that  the  judge  fell
    into error in his assessment of it, on grounds to which I will  return.
    The Secretary of State did not consider there would be any obstacles to
    the appellant's reintegration in Morocco, or  any  exceptional  reasons
    such that his removal would have unjustifiably harsh consequences.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal: paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)

 6. A theme  of  the  evidence  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  the
    appellant's mental health conditions. The judge had the  benefit  of  a
    psychiatric report (Dr Day) and a psychological report (Mr Thorne), and
    a  country  report  from  Dr  I.  Fern�ndez-Molina,   a   lecturer   in
    International Relations  at  the  University  of  Exeter,  as  well  as
    statements from two of the appellant's support workers. Dr  Day  opined
    at page 22 of her report that the appellant was fit to  give  evidence,
    provided steps were taken to accommodate his vulnerability. The hearing
    before the judge proceeded on the basis of submissions only.

 7. The medical reports and the evidence of the appellant's support workers
    said that appellant experiences depression and anxiety and  is  reliant
    on his support network  to  cope.   He  has  symptoms  which  could  be
    paranoid schizophrenia, and some PTSD  symptoms,  although  those  were
    harder to confirm due to his guarded mental state (see Dr Day  at  page
    16).  The judge accepted that evidence.  At [56] he said:

         "Looking at his  medical  condition  as  expressed  in  two  expert
         reports as well as  two  professional  support  tworkers  [sic],  I
         cannot simply brush aside the comment that the  appellant's  mental
         health would be under severe strain if he goes back. He  is  likely
         to  become  more  suspicious  and  to   experience   the   negative
         consequences of stress. He is likely to have 'raises  [sic]  stress
         hormones, inability to relax and elevated fear. I believe he  could
         deteriorate  and  his  psychotic  symptoms...   may   be   worsened
         culminating in a psychotic breakdown.'"

    Although the judge did not say so in terms,  the  quote  in  the  above
    paragraph appears to be taken from paragraph 65 of Mr  Thorne's  report
    dated 10 February 2020.

 8. The judge said that both experts had been  unable  to  agree  upon  the
    condition(s) from which the appellant suffers, or make  arrive  at  any
    form of firm diagnosis (see [52]). At [53], the  judge  noted  that  Mr
    Thorne's report recorded depressed mood and  anxiety  symptoms  in  the
    appellant, although did not diagnose him as being clinically depressed.
    The appellant, noted Mr Thorne, had declined to engage with the  mental
    health services available to him, preferring  to  self  medicate  using
    controlled substances.

 9. The judge concluded that the appellant  would  face  "very  significant
    obstacles" to his integration in Morocco upon his  return,  within  the
    meaning of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the  Immigration  Rules.   Having
    outlined the support the appellant receives in this  country  at  [55],
    the findings of Dr Day at [58], and an extract from the country  report
    of Dr Fern�ndez-Molina at [60] concerning the comparative  availability
    of mental healthcare in Morocco, the judge concluded at [63]  in  these
    terms:

         "I have borne in mind the fact that the appellant's mother  remains
         in Morocco and he has two younger siblings. However, his father  is
         dead. Given his complex needs, including the support he receives in
         the United Kingdom, I conclude that the  absence  of  that  support
         structure which his mother and two younger  siblings  alone  cannot
         provide, the appellant would not be able to integrate into Moroccan
         society in the sense explained by the court in [Kamara v  Secretary
         of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 813; [2016] 4  WLR
         152]."

10. At [64] the judge said, "I conclude therefore that the appellant  meets
    the requirement of paragraph  276  ADE(1)(vi)."   At  [76],  under  the
    heading Decision, the judge said, "I allow this appeal on human  rights
    grounds."

Permission to appeal

11. Permission to appeal was granted to the appellant and the Secretary  of
    State by Upper Tribunal Judge Martin.

12. The appellant advanced four grounds of appeal:

        a. Ground 1: the judge relied on his own opinion  of  the  inherent
           plausibility of the appellant's asylum claim.

        b. Ground 2: the judge failed  to  direct  himself  concerning  the
           impact of the appellant's age and vulnerability  when  assessing
           the appellant's credibility, and failed  to  take  into  account
           expert evidence relied  upon  by  the  appellant  when  reaching
           adverse plausibility and credibility findings.

        c. Ground 3: the judge failed to  make  findings  on  live  issues,
           namely  whether  the  appellant  was  at  risk  of   Article   3
           consequences  upon  his  return  as  a  result  of  his   health
           conditions,  and  whether  the  appellant   would   face   being
           persecuted as a result  of  his  membership  of  the  particular
           social group, namely a person living with mental  ill-health  in
           Morocco.

        d. Ground 4: the judge relied on matters adverse to  the  appellant
           which had not been raised by the Secretary of State, nor put  to
           him or his appellant.

13. The Secretary of State's grounds of appeal against  the  judge's  human
    rights findings were as follows:

        a. There was no basis upon which the judge  was  entitled  to  find
           that the appellant's removal to Morocco would breach  his  human
           rights.  His mother and sisters still live there and could  help
           him to access the support he needs.

        b. The judge failed to  identify  which  article  of  the  European
           Convention on Human Rights he allowed the appeal under.

        c. The threshold for Article 3 ECHR is very high, even as  modified
           by the Supreme Court in AM (Zimbabwe) v Secretary of  State  for
           the Home Department [2020] UKSC 17.

The law

14. Article 3 of the European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  ("the  ECHR")
    provides:

         "No one shall be subjected to torture or to  inhuman  or  degrading
         treatment or punishment."

15. Article 8 provides:

         "1. Everyone has the right to respect for his  private  and  family
         life, his home and his correspondence.

         2. There shall be no interference by a public  authority  with  the
         exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law
         and is necessary in  a  democratic  society  in  the  interests  of
         national security, public safety or the economic well-being of  the
         country,  for  the  prevention  of  disorder  or  crime,  for   the
         protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights
         and freedoms of others."

Discussion

16. In a rule 24 response dated 5 February 2021, the Secretary of State did
    not oppose the appellant's appeal against the dismissal of  his  asylum
    claim.  It was accepted that the judge failed to consider the impact of
    the appellant's vulnerability on the assessment of his  evidence,  such
    that  the  credibility  assessment  was  flawed.   In  further  written
    submissions dated 16 February 2021, the  Secretary  of  State  expanded
    upon her  position.   The  judge  had  failed  to  consider  the  Joint
    Presidential Guidance Note No. 2 of 2010, nor the principles enunciated
    in SB (vulnerable adult: credibility)  Ghana  [2019]  UKUT  398  (IAC).
    Before me, Mr Tufan adopted the same approach.  It was common ground at
    the hearing that the judge's credibility assessment was flawed for that
    reason alone and must be set aside.  The judge also failed  to  address
    the health consequences of the appellant's removal, in Article 3 terms,
    as he had been invited to do.  That was an error.

17. There was a discussion at the hearing as  to  whether  the  appellant's
    claim to be a member of a particular social group ("PSG") on account of
    his mental health conditions was a "new matter"  for  the  purposes  of
    section 85(5) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   If
    it were, the First-tier Tribunal would have lacked the jurisdiction  to
    consider the point, subject to the consent of the Secretary  of  State.
    I raise this issue here for completeness.  It is not necessary  for  me
    to resolve it, in light of the common  ground  concerning  the  judge's
    flawed credibility assessment,  which  requires  the  entirety  of  the
    judge's credibility assessment to be conducted  afresh  in  any  event.
    For the reasons set out below, I remit this case in its entirety to the
    First-tier Tribunal.  It will be for that  tribunal  to  determine  the
    issues to be resolved upon the decision being remade, including whether
    the PSG point is a "new matter".

The Secretary of State's appeal

18. I turn now to the Secretary of State's appeal against the judge's human
    rights findings.

19. Mr Tufan submitted that the judge erred  by  purporting  to  allow  the
    appeal "under the Immigration Rules", whereas human rights appeals  may
    only be allowed on human rights grounds.  That  submission  is  without
    merit.  It is clear  from  [47]  that  the  judge  was  addressing  the
    appellant's human rights claim through his consideration  of  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi).  That paragraph provides that, subject to certain  other
    criteria (none of which is disputed in these proceedings), a person  is
    entitled to limited leave to remain on human  rights  grounds,  if  the
    person:

         "...is aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously in the UK for
         less than 20 years (discounting any  period  of  imprisonment)  but
         there would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  the  applicant's
         integration into the country to  which  he  would  have  to  go  if
         required to leave the UK..." (Emphasis added)

20. The judge summarised the import of the "private life" provisions of the
    Immigration Rules at [48], correctly  noting  that  they  set  out  the
    Secretary of State's view as to the assessment of private life  claims.
    Only if that assessment fails would an assessment "outside"  the  rules
    be necessary, the judge noted.   I consider that  the  judge  correctly
    approached the role of the Immigration Rules in a human  rights  appeal
    as setting out the Secretary of State's view as to the  proportionality
    of the matters encapsulated by Article 8(2) of the ECHR.   In addition,
    as the Secretary of State's skeleton argument dated  16  February  2021
    now rightly concedes, it is clear that  the  judge  allowed  the  human
    rights appeal under Article 8, so nothing turns on that criticism:  see
    [11].

21. The judge did not, therefore, err on account  of  having  allowed  this
    human rights appeal  "under  the  Immigration  Rules".   The  operative
    decision of the  judge  was  to  allow  the  appeal  "on  human  rights
    grounds": see [76].  Where an individual meets the requirements of  the
    rules, that is positively determinative of the proportionality question
    under Article 8(2) of the Immigration  Rules.   As  the  former  Senior
    President of Tribunals held in TZ (Pakistan) v Secretary of  State  for
    the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 1109 at [34]:

         "...where a person satisfies the Rules, whether or not by reference
         to an article 8 informed requirement, then this will be  positively
         determinative of that person's article  8  appeal,  provided  their
         case engages article 8(1), for the very reason that it  would  then
         be disproportionate for that person to be removed."

22.  The  Secretary  of  State's  true  complaint  lies  with  the  judge's
    conclusion that the appellant would face "very  significant  obstacles"
    to  his  integration  in  Morocco  within  the  meaning  of   paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules.   At  its  heart,  that  was  a
    finding of fact.  Appeals lie to this tribunal on points of law, rather
    than disagreements of fact.  Of course, certain findings of fact may be
    infected by errors of law, thereby falling within the  jurisdiction  of
    the Upper Tribunal to consider whether the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal involved the making of  an  error  of  law.   In  R  (Iran)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005]  EWCA  Civ  982,  the
    Court of Appeal summarised, at [9], some of  the  bases  upon  which  a
    finding of fact may be infected by  an  error  of  law.   They  include
    failing to give adequate reasons  for  findings  on  material  matters,
    giving weight to immaterial matters, and making a material misdirection
    of law on any material matter.

23. Mr Tufan relied on the Secretary of State's  grounds  of  appeal.   The
    judge did not provide any reasons  for  finding  that  the  appellant's
    mother and sisters would not be able to support him  upon  his  return.
    That was a finding central to his conclusion that the  appellant  would
    face "very significant obstacles" upon his return, and one  which  was,
    therefore, insufficiently reasoned, he submitted.

24. Mr Tufan  also  submitted  that  the  judge  approached  the  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi)/Article 8 private life assessment as  though  it  were  a
    proxy for Article 3 health claims, without having  set  out  the  clear
    distinction between Article 3 and Article 8.  By his discussion of  the
    appellant's health  conditions,  and  the  relative  unavailability  of
    healthcare in Morocco (see [60]), the judge approached  the  Article  8
    private life analysis within an Article 3  health  paradigm,  and  took
    into account an irrelevant consideration, namely  the  relatively  poor
    mental health provision the appellant would receive  in  Morocco.   The
    comparison between British and Moroccan standards of healthcare was not
    the test, he submitted.  Given the judge purported to allow the  appeal
    in  light  of  the  appellant's  mental  health  conditions,  and   the
    comparative lack of  support  he  would  receive  in  Morocco,  it  was
    incumbent upon him to have approached his discussion  by  reference  to
    the test for Article 3 health claims, namely that  as  set  out  in  AM
    (Zimbabwe) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department,  pursuant  to
    Paposhvili  v  Belgium  (Application   no.   41738/10).    There   were
    insufficient reasons for allowing the appeal on this  basis,  submitted
    Mr Tufan.

25. Resisting those submissions, Ms  Cohen  submitted  that  there  was  no
    substance to the Secretary of State's complaint that the reasons  given
    by the judge at [63] were inadequate.  The judge's  findings  that  the
    appellant's mother and sisters in Morocco could not  provide  him  with
    the assistance he requires  must  be  viewed  in  the  context  of  the
    evidence before the First-tier Tribunal, with which  the  parties  were
    familiar.  The judge would have been familiar with the evidence of  GN,
    the  appellant's  support  worker  with  the   South   London   Refugee
    Association.  At [22] of her statement dated 10 February 2020, GN wrote
    that the appellant's family in Morocco do not  know  about  his  health
    conditions.  They  would  not  understand  and  would  think  that  his
    conditions were shameful.  In any event, [63] was not the highpoint  of
    the judge's findings; the thrust of the Day report's  conclusions,  for
    example at pages 15, 16 and 22, was that the  appellant  would  not  be
    able to cope if returned to Morocco.  That was plainly relevant to  the
    appellant's private life claim.  The judge accepted that evidence.  The
    Secretary of State simply disagrees with the judge's findings.

26. I accept Mr Tufan's submissions.  The judge gave  insufficient  reasons
    for finding that the appellant's mother and sisters would not  be  able
    to  support  him.   Secondly,  he  approached  his  analysis   of   the
    appellant's health-based Article 8 private  life  claim  without  first
    having addressed the factual matrix through the lens of  an  Article  3
    assessment.

27. The judge's operative conclusion was that the appellant,  having  lived
    in Morocco for most of his formative years, with  the  support  of  his
    mother and sisters, with whom he  remains  in  contact,  would  not  be
    receive from them the support he needs.  I agree with Mr Tufan that the
    reader of the decision is left wondering why the appellant's mother and
    sisters would not be able to help him to (re)establish his  family  and
    private life in  Morocco.   Their  role  was  plainly  central  to  the
    appellant's prospect of reintegrating in Morocco.  While I accept  that
    GN wrote in her statement that the appellant would not want to speak to
    his family about his mental health conditions, that  is  not  a  factor
    capable of addressing the broader factors which  are  inherent  to  the
    concept of integration.

28. At [62], the judge quoted from the well-known passage at [14] of Kamara
    v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  813;
    [2016] 4 WLR 152.  Sales LJ there stated that:

         "The idea of "integration" calls for a broad evaluative judgment to
         be made as to whether the individual will be enough of  an  insider
         in terms of understanding how life in the  society  in  that  other
         country is carried on and a capacity to participate in it, so as to
         have a reasonable opportunity to be accepted there, to be  able  to
         operate on a day-to-day basis in  that  society  and  to  build  up
         within a reasonable time a variety of human relationships  to  give
         substance to the individual's private or  family  life."  (emphasis
         added)

29. Even if the appellant may have some difficulties in speaking about  his
    mental health conditions and drug use with his family in Morocco,  that
    does not address his wider ability to rely on his  sisters  and  mother
    for their support in other aspects of his life.  The  medical  evidence
    before the judge outlined how the appellant  has  engaged  with  mental
    health services here to only a limited extent, despite the support  and
    encouragement to do so that he currently enjoys.  It is  not  clear  to
    the reader of the decision, even when armed  with  the  materials  that
    were before the judge, as  to  why  the  appellant's  unwillingness  to
    engage with  his  mother  and  sisters  concerning  his  mental  health
    conditions would place his  broader  integration  at  risk,  given  the
    minimal medical support he currently receives in this country  for  his
    mental health conditions, even with the benefit of his current  support
    networks.

30. I also accept Mr Tufan's remaining submissions about the deficiency  in
    the  judge's  "very   significant   obstacles"   analysis.    Paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) of  the  Immigration  Rules  intends  to  articulate  the
    Secretary of State's Article 8 ECHR private  life  obligations  towards
    applicants.  When approaching what amounts  to  "integration"  for  the
    purposes of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) in the context  of  a  health-based
    integration claim, it was incumbent upon the  judge  to  have  directed
    himself concerning (and, moreover, considered)  the  threshold  for  an
    Article 3-based health claim.  As Ms Cohen's  third  ground  of  appeal
    correctly contends, the judge had failed expressly to address Article 3
    at all.  That was an error which not only left an Article 3-shaped void
    in the judge's decision, but it also led to the judge failing  to  take
    account of a relevant consideration when addressing Article  8  through
    the lens of the "very significant obstacles" test.

31. There has been extensive judicial  consideration  of  the  relationship
    between Article 3 claims and Article 8  health-based  claims.   Health-
    based Article 8 claims  are  not  lesser  form  of  Article  3  claims,
    pursuant to a lower threshold.   Accordingly,  an  assessment  of  what
    amounts to "very significant obstacles" based on a health claim  should
    take place in the context of the health claim having also been assessed
    within the  Article  3  paradigm.   That  assessment  will  inform  and
    calibrate  the  assessment  of  what  amounts  to   "very   significant
    obstacles" for the purposes of  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi),  as  it  will
    guide the decision maker to focus on  the  integration  aspect  of  the
    "very significant obstacles" test, over and above health and  treatment
    difficulties. In PF  (Nigeria)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department  [2019]  EWCA  Civ  1139,  Hickinbottom  LJ  addressed   the
    relationship between articles 3 and 8 in these terms, at [19]:

         "...although they each seek to translate the value of human dignity
         and freedom (which is the very heart of  the  ECHR)  into  specific
         rights  of  individuals   and   the   same   factual   matrix   may
         coincidentally engage both article 3 and article 8,  the  focus  of
         and relevant criteria for the two provisions are very different. In
         particular, it is wrong in principle to consider that an article  3
         claim can be treated in the alternative as an article 8 claim  with
         the  latter  simply  having  a  "lower"  threshold.  The  threshold
         criteria are essentially different in nature, not  (or,  at  least,
         not only) degree."

32. By failing to conduct a free-standing Article 3  ECHR  assessment,  the
    judge failed to have regard to considerations that were material to the
    related assessment of the  health-based  "very  significant  obstacles"
    claim under paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).

33. For these reasons, I consider the judge's human rights analysis  to  be
    flawed and must be set aside.

34. Even if the judge's Article 8 analysis was not  flawed  to  the  extent
    that set out above, I would not have preserved those findings.  As  the
    appellant and Secretary of State agree, the judge failed to conduct  an
    Article 3 analysis.  While he addressed some of the matters that  would
    be relevant to such an assessment under his Article 8 analysis, he  did
    not do so in the context of addressing the extensive  jurisprudence  on
    Article 3.  Nor did he consider whether the appellant was a member of a
    PSG who faced being persecuted in Morocco on that account  (subject  to
    the issue as to whether the Secretary of State's consent was required).
     Extensive findings of fact are yet to  be  made,  some  of  which  may
    overlap with the health-based Article 8 findings already reached by the
    judge.  I do not consider that the existing findings of fact concerning
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) are sufficiently distinct from the  matters  in
    relation to which it is common ground that the judge failed properly to
    address to enable those findings to be preserved.   Preserving  health-
    based Article 8 findings which should have been reached in the  context
    of an overall assessment of the appellant's health from  an  Article  3
    (and possibly PSG) perspective could unnecessarily tie the hands of the
    tribunal seized with the remaking of this  appeal.   The  findings  are
    interlinked and cannot readily be differentiated.   A full  reappraisal
    of the case is required.

35. The appellant did not give evidence  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    meaning that the prospect of the Article 8 findings being set aside and
    remade does not expose him to the ordeal of having to give evidence for
    a second time on the same issues.  The concerns highlighted by Carnwath
    LJ in HF (Algeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2007]
    EWCA Civ 445 at [26] would not apply here.  Of  course,  the  appellant
    may choose to give evidence when the matter is remade, subject  to  any
    reasonable  adjustments  that  may  be  required  to  accommodate   his
    vulnerability (a matter in relation to which  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    has great expertise), but if he does so, he will be giving evidence for
    the first time.

36.  Setting  aside  the  decision  in  its  entirety  is,  therefore,  the
    appropriate course.

37. I find that the decision of Judge Hussain involved  the  making  of  an
    error of law.  Pursuant to section 12(2)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts
    and Enforcement Act 2007, I set the decision aside,  with  no  findings
    preserved.  Pursuant to paragraph 7.2(b) of the Practice Statements  of
    the Immigration and Asylum Chambers of the First-tier Tribunal and  the
    Upper Tribunal, the  extent  of  the  fact  finding  required  for  the
    resolution of this matter is such that it is appropriate to  remit  the
    case to the First-tier Tribunal, to be  heard  afresh  by  a  different
    judge.



Notice of Decision

The decision of Judge Hussain involved the making of an error of law and  is
set aside with no findings of fact preserved.

The case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard by  a  different
judge.

I maintain the anonymity order already in force.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
