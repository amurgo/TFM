                            DECISION AND REASONS



Introduction

 1. The appellant is a national of Nigeria, born  on  25th  February  1996.
    Applications were made on 18 February 2014 and the 5 March 2014 seeking
    confirmation she had the right to reside by virtue of  European  Treaty
    provisions. The first application was rejected because the  appropriate
    fee had not been paid. The importance of the first application lies  in
    the fact that at that stage the appellant  was  under  the  age  of  18
    whereas in the second application she was over 18.  At  the  same  time
    these applications were made applications were also made for AO said to
    be her mother.

 2. The basis of the applications was a claim to derived rights from Master
    A. He was born in the United Kingdom on 1 August 2006 and was  entitled
    to a British nationality through his father. The claim made by  AO  was
    that she was his mother and that it was necessary for her to be in  the
    United Kingdom to care for him. AO claimed that HI was her daughter and
    so the half sister of Master A.

 3. The relevant provisions in the Immigration (EEA) regulations 2006  (the
    `2006 regulations') are  as follows:

         'Derivative right of residence

         15A. (1) A person ("P") who is not an exempt person and who
             satisfies the criteria in paragraph (2), (3), (4), (4A) or (5)
             of this regulation is entitled to a derivative right to reside
             in the United Kingdom for as long as P satisfies the relevant
             criteria.

             (2)  P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-

                  (a)  P is the primary carer of an EEA national ...

             (3)  P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-

                  (a)  P is the child of an EEA national ...

             (4)  P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-

                  (a)  P is the primary carer of a person meeting the
                  criteria in paragraph (3) ...

             (4A) P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-

                  (a)  P is the primary carer of a British citizen ("the
                  relevant British citizen");

                  (b)  the relevant British citizen is residing in the
                  United Kingdom; and

                  (c)  the relevant British citizen would be unable to
                  reside in the UK or in another EEA State if P were
                  required to leave.

             (5)  P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-

                  (a)  P is under the age of 18;

                  (b)  P's primary carer is entitled to a derivative right
                  to reside in the United Kingdom by virtue of paragraph (2)
                  or (4);

                  (c)  P does not have leave to enter, or remain in, the
                  United Kingdom; and

                  (d)  requiring P to leave the United Kingdom would prevent
                  P's primary carer from residing in the United Kingdom.

             (7)  P is to be regarded as a "primary carer" of another
             person if

                  (a)  P is a direct relative or a legal guardian of that
                  person; and

                  (b)  P-

                      (i)  is the person who has primary responsibility for
                      that person's care ...

         ...

         18A. (1) The Secretary of State must issue a person with a
             derivative residence card on application and on production of-

                  (a)  a valid identity card issued by an EEA State or a
                  valid passport; and

                  (b)  proof that the applicant has a derivative right of
                  residence under regulation 15A.'

 4. The respondent gave decisions in respect of the 5 March applications on
    the 1st July 2014. AO's application was  refused  because  it  was  not
    accepted she was the mother  of  Master  A.  In  the  alternative,  the
    respondent was not satisfied his father could not  care  for  him.  The
    respondent noted he had been placed with carers and did not  accept  AO
    was his primary carer.

 5. The respondent did not accept that AO was HI's mother. In any event  HI
    was unable to derive a right of residence as a dependent of AO (had she
    been accepted as Master A's primary carer) because she was over  18  at
    the time of the 5th March 2014 application. Aside from her age  it  was
    noted that she had been placed in a boarding school for  several  years
    which called into question any dependency upon AO.

 6. The appeal against that decision was heard by  First-tier  Judge  Place
    sitting at Nottingham on 2 October 2014. In a decision  promulgated  on
    14 October 2014 the judge allowed the appeal of AO,  finding  that  she
    was the mother of Master A, a British citizen, who would not be able to
    remain in the  United  Kingdom  was  held  her.  Consequently  she  was
    entitled to a derivative residence card under regulation 15A.

 7. Judge Place decided that HI was not entitled to a derivative  residence
    card because she was over 18 when the March 2014 was  made.  The  judge
    noted there had been an application a week before her 18th birthday but
    the only comment was that the situation was  confused.  The  judge  did
    accept that AO was her mother; that she was financially dependent  upon
    her and in full-time education.

 8. The judge proceeded to consider HI's freestanding Article 8 rights.  No
    argument was advanced under the immigration  rules.  The  judge  stated
    that whilst there were no removal directions the logical consequence of
    the respondent's decision was that eventually she would be removed.

 9. The judge concluded that family life was not  engage  because  she  was
    over 18 and had not demonstrated more than the usual ties of dependency
    between herself, her mother and her half brother.

10. It was accepted that she has an established private life in the  United
    Kingdom and  that  her  education  would  be  interrupted  by  removal.
    Reference was made to section 117B of  the  National,  Immigration  and
    Asylum  Act  2002.  The  judge  concluded   that   the   decision   was
    proportionate as her education with not at a  critical  stage  and  she
    could reapply for entry clearance as a student.

The Upper Tribunal

11. HI obtained permission to appeal granted on the basis the judge did not
    deal adequately with the rejected  application  of  the  18th  February
    2014, made when she was under 18. It was also arguable that  the  judge
    erred in concluding family life  did  not  exist  given  that  she  was
    dependent of her mother and still in education.  In  carrying  out  the
    proportionality exercise it was  arguable  that  the  judge  failed  to
    factor in that she may have been entitled  to  a  derivative  right  of
    residence before she was 18.

12. Section 8 of the application form is dated 18 February 2014. The  first
    page of the application  form  contains  two  date  stamps,  namely  20
    February 2014 and 6 March  2014.  In  the  appellant's  Upper  Tribunal
    appeal bundle there is a letter from the respondent at page  53,  dated
    25 February 2014. It refers to receipt  of  the  application  form  and
    states that  if  there  is  an  issue  over  the  application  fee  the
    application will be deemed to be invalid. There is a further letter  at
    page  54,  dated  1  March  2014  referring  to  the  Immigration   and
    Nationality (Cost Recovery Fees) Regulations 2011 and  the  Immigration
    and Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2011. The letter advised that from 1
    July 2013 fees apply to EEA applications. The letter goes on  to  state
    that the application of 18 February  2014  made  was  invalid  and  was
    returned because the fee had not been paid.

13. The appellant's  representative  replied  on  11  March  2014  refuting
    suggestions the fee had not been paid. The letter states  that  further
    payment is being made in the interests of the appellant .Page 65  is  a
    copy of a cheque dated 5 March 2014 for the  relevant  amount,ï¿½110  for
    two applicants. The solicitor's provided their Lloyds  bank  statements
    showing encashment of this cheque on 12 March 2014. The statements  ran
    from the 20th February 2014 and no earlier corresponding withdrawal  is
    identified.

14. Page 66 of the appellant's  bundle  contains  the  final  page  of  the
    application relating to payment. It  is  dated  18  February  2014  and
    indicated that payment was being made by Visa card. The cardholder  was
    a member of the solicitors  firm  acting  for  the  appellant.  In  the
    solicitor's letter it was suggested that  the  payment  page  had  been
    removed from the application form when it was returned to their office.



15. I cannot determine what went wrong but on the balance of  probabilities
    I find that the fee had not been paid the original application. If paid
    by visa debit card the appellant's representatives could  have  checked
    their statements to show payment. I can think  of  no  reason  why  the
    respondent would not process an application  if  the  proper  fee  were
    paid. Consequently, as the fee was not paid the first  application  was
    not valid.

16. In any event, the skeleton argument on behalf of the appellant does not
    consider regulation 15A properly. Master A is a British national. Under
    the definition section of the 2006 regulations "EEA national"  means  a
    national  of  an  EEA  State  who  is  not  also  a  British   citizen.
    Consequently, he is not an EEA national for these purposes.  Regulation
    15A(5) applies where the claimant is under the  age  of  18  and  their
    primary carer is entitled to a derivative right to reside in the United
    Kingdom by virtue  of  paragraph  (2)  or  (4).  These  paragraphs  are
    concerned with EEA nationals. It is (4A) that is the relevant provision
    here. Consequently,  the  decision  under  the  Treaty  provisions  was
    correct.

17. A separate issue relates to Article 8. For some  time  there  has  been
    uncertainty as to whether it is premature  to  raise  Article  8  in  a
    Treaty application when there are no  removal  Directions.  There  have
    been substantial changes to the appeal rights under the EEA Regulations
    which took effect on  6  April  2015.  These  changes  are  subject  to
    transitional provisions in regulation 6 of  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) (Amendment) Regulations (SI 2015/694) to the effect that
    the changes have no effect in relation to  an  appeal  against  an  EEA
    decision where that decision was taken before 6th April 2015.From  then
    an appeal against an 'EEA decision' is on the ground that  it  breaches
    rights under the EU Treaties.  Human  rights,  as  part  of  their  EEA
    appeal,  can only be raised  in response to a section 120 notice issued
    by the Home Office, or as a new matter raised before the Tribunal,  but
    subject to the Secretary of State's consent.

18. Amirteymour and others (EEA appeals; human rights)  [2015]  UKUT  00466
    (IAC) considered the issue of arguing Article 8  where no notice  under
    section 120 of the 2002 Act has been served  and  no  EEA  decision  to
    remove has been made. The conclusion was that an appellant cannot bring
    a Human Rights  challenge  to  removal  in  an  appeal  under  the  EEA
    Regulations. At para 69 and 70 it was stated:

         "70. We do not, therefore, consider that JM  (Liberia)  applies  to
         these appeals. We remind ourselves of what was  said  in  Patel  at
         [62] (see above). An application made for a residence  document  as
         confirmation of an existing right and an  application  based  on  a
         claim that removal  would  be  contrary  to  the  United  Kingdom's
         obligations  under  the  Human  Rights  Convention   are   entirely
         different. To permit an appellant to do so would be precisely  what
         the Supreme Court says section 85 (2) does not permit - the raising
         of an entirely different head of application outside the  scope  of
         the initial application.

         75.  ... we conclude that, where no notice under section 120 of the
         2002 Act has been served and where no EEA decision  to  remove  has
         been  made,  an  appellant  cannot  in  an  appeal  under  the  EEA
         Regulations bring a Human Rights challenge to removal."

19. This decision was not available at the time of the First-tier  tribunal
    but from it the First tier Tribunal was wrong  to  consider  Article  8
    when there were no removal directions. At  paragraph  32,  Judge  Place
    commented that there were no removal directions but  felt  entitled  to
    proceed to consider Article 8 on the basis  that  the  appellant  would
    eventually be removed. However, if this arose there would  be  separate
    appeal rights.

20. In line with Amirteymour and others (EEA appeals; human rights)  [2015]
    UKUT 00466 (IAC) Judge Place erred in considering the Article 8  claim.
    The judge is not to be faulted for this because at that stage the Upper
    Tribunal guidance was not available.

21. Had the Article 8 consideration been properly open to the judge then it
    was wrong to conclude that family life did  not  exist.  The  principal
    reason the judge excluded family life was because the appellant was 18.
    Rather than applying a blanket rule with regard to adult children  each
    case should be analysed on its own facts (see Singh & Anor v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 630).  However, as the
    issue  should  not  have  been  considered  this  makes   no   material
    difference.

Decision.

The decision of First-tier Judge Place in relation to  the  EEA  regulations
is correct in law and shall stand.

The determination of the appellant's Article 8 rights is premature.
