Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr S Staunton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mould, counsel (instructed by Legacy Law
Solicitors)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. I shall refer to the appellant as the secretary of state  and  to  the
      respondent as "the claimant."


   2. The claimant is a national of Nigeria, born on 21  January  1988.  His
      appeal  against  the  decision  of  the  respondent  to   refuse   his
      application for leave to remain in the UK on human rights grounds  was
      allowed under the  Immigration  Rules  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Hindson in a decision promulgated on 22 March 2016.


   3. The Judge was satisfied that the appellant and his partner  are  in  a
      genuine and  subsisting  relationship  and  intend  to  live  together
      permanently [16].


   4. On 17 November 2016, Upper  Tier  Tribunal  Judge  Kekiï¿½  granted  the
      secretary of state permission to appeal  on  the  basis  that  it  was
      arguable that  in  finding  that  the  relationship  was  genuine  and
      durable, the Judge failed to make any findings in  relation  to  EX.1.
      She  also  found  it  to  be  arguable  that  his  assessment  of  the
      relationship was inadequate, albeit that this had not been  raised  by
      the secretary of state as a ground of appeal.


   5. Mr Staunton accepted at the outset of the hearing that the reasons for
      appealing had simply contended that the refusal letter did not concede
      that the financial requirements under the rules of EX.1 had been  met.
      It was contended in the grounds that the Judge, having determined that
      the relationship was genuine and subsisting, needed to go further  and
      make findings in relation to those aspects as well before allowing the
      appeal.


   6. Mr Staunton accepted that it had not been incumbent on  the  Judge  to
      consider the financial requirements or EX.1 under  the  Rules  in  the
      circumstances.


   7. On behalf of the claimant, Mr Mould contended that the 'second ground'
      raised should not be before the Upper Tribunal.


   8. He referred to Nixon (Permission to Appeal: Grounds) [2014] UKUT 00368
      (IAC). The President stated that there is  also  recognition  that  in
      some cases, a clear point may not  be  identified  in  the  permission
      application by reason of lack of skill, knowledge or pressure of time.
      There is thus a duty to consider points that are  "Robinson  obvious".
      There is also power to consider  any  other  point  arising  from  the
      decision if the interests of justice so require.


   9. Mr Mould submitted that this was not a Robinson obvious point. Nor did
      it  meet  the  high  test  set  in  Robinson.  The  respondent  was  a
      represented party. Nor did the interests of justice require  that  the
      additional ground be considered. The ground had not been raised by the
      parties. It was not Robinson obvious. It  may  lead  to  a  reasonably
      independent observer questioning the independence of the Tribunal. Nor
      had there been an application  to  amend  her  grounds  of  appeal  to
      include the additional ground raised by the Judge.


  10. In any event, it  had  no  prospect  of  success  and  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge had given adequate reasons, albeit briefly stated.


  11. Mr Mould also submitted that the First-tier Judge did not err  in  not
      making any findings in relation to EX.1. The respondent contended that
      EX.1 did not apply as  the  claimant  did  not  meet  the  eligibility
      requirements, namely it was not accepted  that  his  relationship  was
      genuine and subsisting. The secretary of state did not take the  point
      that EX.1 was not met.


  12. Accordingly, the  failure  to  consider  EX.1  did  not  constitute  a
      material error of law.


  13.  Mr  Staunton  stated  in  reply  that  he  has  "been  left  in  some
      difficulty."


      Assessment


  14. In the reasons for refusal the secretary of state  conceded  that  the
      suitability requirements in S-LTR of paragraph R-LTRP.1.1 (d)(ii)  had
      been met by the  claimant.  It  was  not  however  accepted  that  the
      claimant met the eligibility requirements having regard to the  nature
      of the claimed relationship. A  number  of  alleged  inconsistent  and
      conflicting answers were given casting doubt on the credibility of the
      case.


  15. As he had failed to meet the eligibility requirements,  he  could  not
      benefit from the criteria set out at EX.1.


  16. The issue in the case as identified by  the  secretary  of  state  was
      accordingly the nature of the claimed relationship of the claimant and
      the sponsor. That is the issue that the Judge was required to address.
      Accordingly, whether or not the claimant met the requirements of  EX.1
      was not a live issue before the First-tier Tribunal. The secretary  of
      state did not however contend that EX.1 had not been met.


  17. Accordingly, as submitted by Mr Mould, the Judge cannot be  criticised
      for not considering a matter which had  not  been  raised  as  a  live
      issue.


  18. The appeal was decided on the papers. The appeal was allowed under the
      Rules.


  19. I have also considered whether the First-tier Tribunal's findings that
      the relationship  was  genuine  and  durable  were  not  supported  by
      adequate reasons. I do not find  that  this  constitutes  a  "Robinson
      obvious" point. It was not raised as a ground  of  appeal  by  a  very
      experienced senior presenting officer.


  20. There is a legal duty to give a brief explanation of the conclusion on
      the central issue on which an appeal is determined. Those reasons  may
      not be extensive if the decision as a whole makes sense, having regard
      to the material  accepted  by  the  Judge  -  Shizad  (Sufficiency  of
      reasons: Set Aside) [2013] UKUT 00085.


  21. In coming to his conclusion, the Judge noted that the claimant and his
      wife were asked a total of 57 questions, 13 of which were  claimed  to
      have resulted in inconsistent answers. The Judge noted that 77% of the
      answers were accordingly sufficiently consistent so  as  not  to  cast
      suspicion on the genuineness of the relationship.


  22. He also had regard to the fact that some of the questions relied on by
      the secretary of state were in any event not so significant.


  23. He found that a detailed question by question analysis was of  limited
      help and looked at the interview as a whole.  He  concluded  that  the
      couple are in a genuine and subsisting relationship.


  24. It is evident that  the  Judge's  reasons  were  "briefly  stated"  as
      submitted by Mr Mould. However, the decision as a whole  makes  sense,
      having regard to the material accepted by the Judge.  The  basis  upon
      which his conclusion was arrived at is accordingly sustainable.


      Notice of Decision


      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making  of
      any material error on a point of law. It shall accordingly stand.


      No anonymity direction is made.
