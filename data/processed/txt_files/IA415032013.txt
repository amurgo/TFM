                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell


                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

 1. In the decision of  a  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  promulgated  on  17
    February 2014 the appellant's appeal against a  refusal  to  grant  him
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant under the points-
    based system was dismissed.

 2. The appellant was granted permission to appeal  that  decision  and  an
    error of law hearing  was  fixed  before  me  on  16  June  2014.   The
    appellant's solicitors wrote a letter dated  12  June  2014  indicating
    that they wished the hearing to be dealt with "on the papers".

 3. By a letter dated  21  May  2014  the  respondent  indicated  that  the
    original refusal decision may be contrary to the  respondent's  current
    policy and the matter was referred to Tier 4  "Customer  Services"  for
    consideration.

 4. At the hearing before me Mr Whitwell sought permission to withdraw  the
    original decision on the basis that at the date  of  refusal  the  then
    current policy was not to refuse applications on the  basis  that  this
    application was.  The decision should therefore not have been to refuse
    on the basis set out in the Reasons for Refusal Letter.

 5. Having considered the matter and Rule 17(2) of The  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  I  consented  to  the  withdrawal  of  the
    decision against which the appellant originally appealed.



Signed                              Date


Upper Tribunal Judge Pinkerton
