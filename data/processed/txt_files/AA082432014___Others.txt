Representation:
For the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Appellants:    Mr Halligan, Counsel instructed by
                                 Malik & Malik Solicitors
For the 4th Appellant: Mr Wood, Rochdale Law Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                                   NOTICE

      1. The Appellants are all nationals of Pakistan. The  first  Appellant
         SR is the mother of the remaining Appellants who are all minors.

      2. Their linked appeals against decisions  to  remove  them  from  the
         United Kingdom were dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal on the 8th
         December 2014.  In a written decision dated 27th March 2015  I  set
         aside the findings of the First-tier Tribunal in respect of Article
         8. The findings on the asylum grounds  advanced  by  SR,  with  her
         children as dependents, were expressly preserved.

      3. Subsequent to that decision the Respondent  agreed  to  review  all
         four cases, having particular regard to the fact that Master  A  is
         now in the care of Rochdale Social Services and that his mother and
         siblings continue to have contact with him. At the hearing  on  the
         14th October 2015 Mr Harrison informed the Tribunal and the parties
         that on the 9th October 2015 a decision had been made to grant  all
         four Appellants Discretionary Leave until  the  9th  January  2017,
         that being Master A's birthday.  Written confirmation that this  is
         so has now been provided, by way of letter dated 9th October 2015.

      4. Mr Wood and Mr Halligan indicated their agreement  that  there  was
         before  me  no  residual  protection-based  claim.  There  was  new
         material, namely disclosures made by Master A  to  Rochdale  Social
         Services which may have resulted in a different outcome had it been
         made available to the First-tier Tribunal; that could  not  however
         show there to have been an error of law in the  decision  of  Judge
         Birkby. If the Appellants wish to rely on that evidence in  support
         of a fresh claim, that is a matter for them.

      5. The Appellants have all been granted limited leave to remain in the
         United  Kingdom.  Pursuant  to  s104  (4A)  of   the   Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 these appeals are therefore  deemed
         abandoned.


                                                  Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce

                                                           17th October 2015
