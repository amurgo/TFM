Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss S Vidhyadharan
For the Respondent:    Mr A S Qureshi

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The parties are referred to hereafter as they were  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal so that Mr Ikram is the appellant and the Secretary  of  State
    is the respondent.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on  16  June  1990.
    On 5 September 2012 he applied  for  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant  under  the  points-based
    system ("PBS").  That application was refused by a  decision  dated  11
    January 2013.  A decision was made concurrently to remove the appellant
    from the UK under Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality
    Act 2006.

 3. The reason for refusal was that the appellant  claimed  10  points  for
    Maintenance (Funds) under Appendix C of the Immigration Rules  but  the
    Secretary of State was not satisfied that  the  documents  he  provided
    demonstrated that he had been in possession of the  required  level  of
    funds for 28 days.  He needed to show that he had the required funds to
    cover the fees for the first  academic  year  of  his  course  and,  in
    addition, the sum of �1,000 per month to cover  the  cost  of  his  own
    maintenance.

 4. The appellant paid �5,000 towards the course fees of  �13,925  for  the
    first year of the course.  He therefore needed to show that he  was  in
    possession of �10,925 for a consecutive 28  day  period.   The  closing
    date of the bank statement submitted in support of the  application  is
    dated 1 September 2012 and  the  appellant  therefore  needed  to  show
    evidence of �10,925 in his possession for 28 days from 4 August 2012 to
    1 September 2012.  However, between 4 August 2012 and  12  August  2012
    the bank statements show that he was in  possession  of  no  more  than
    �6,448.92 and between 25  August  and  27  August  2012  no  more  than
    �10,886.67.

 5. The appellant appealed the decision and  the  matter  came  before  the
    Tribunal  sitting  at  Hatton  Cross  on  6  December   2013.    In   a
    determination promulgated  on  6  January  2014  the  First-tier  Judge
    dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules but allowed  it  under
    Article 8 ECHR. He noted that the Section 47 decision was withdrawn.

 6. The respondent sought permission to  appeal  that  decision  submitting
    that in allowing the appeal on Article 8 grounds, having  dismissed  it
    under the  PBS  provisions  in  the  Immigration  Rules,  the  Tribunal
    misdirected itself in  law  as  to  what  amounts  to  a  proportionate
    interference with private life.   In  effect  it  is  argued  that  the
    Tribunal found that the criteria in the PBS Rules imposes a higher test
    than the proportionality test of Article 8.  The submission is that the
    Immigration Rules operate within the margin of  appreciation  available
    to states in interpreting Article  8  obligations  and  that  has  been
    endorsed by parliament.  Miah [2012] EWCA Civ 261 shows that  there  is
    no near miss principle applicable to the Immigration Rules.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted.  The judge doing so  noted  that  the
    appellant did not appeal on human rights grounds  but  the  appeal  was
    allowed under Article 8, the judge concluding that the decision  was  a
    disproportionate interference with the appellant's private life.

The Hearing before Me

 8. In the determination the judge noted at paragraphs 18 and 19  that  the
    PBS Rules are very specific in their requirements.  The judge  did  not
    doubt that  the  appellant  knew  the  sum  of  money  required  to  be
    demonstrated as he had filled in the application form and had correctly
    inserted the amount that he needed to show for  fees  and  maintenance.
    The judge also recognised that there are strict rules  of  evidence  in
    relation  to  the  PBS  but  that  the  evidence  that  the  fees  were
    subsequently paid and the appellant maintained  is  not  evidence  that
    could be considered by the Tribunal in relation to the award of  points
    under the PBS.

 9. The grounds of appeal raised in  the  documentation  submitted  to  the
    Tribunal included reference to the appellant's  private  life  and  his
    rights under Article 8. In her submissions before me Miss  Vidhyadharan
    drew attention to the fact that the judge  dealt  with  the  Article  8
    private life issue at paragraphs 22 and 23.  The judge stated  that  he
    was of the opinion that a student can acquire a private  life  so  that
    the particular goal that he was seeking to achieve could be  completed.
    The judge went  on  to  consider  whether  the  interference  with  the
    appellant's private life by removing him would be disproportionate  and
    found that it would be.  This was on the basis  that  on  the  evidence
    before him including the money spent by the appellant both in fees  and
    maintenance the  interference  with  his  private  life  would  not  be
    proportionate in all the circumstances of the case.  He went on to find
    that it would be disproportionate not to let the appellant complete his
    course of study "at this reputable university in June 2013".

10. Miss Vidhyadharan submitted, however, that  apart  from  the  statement
    from the appellant there was no evidence before the judge that he would
    not be able to obtain a similar degree in Pakistan and nothing  to  say
    what the judge made of  the  statement  that  there  may  be  a  course
    available in Pakistan but the appellant would have to begin  again  and
    his time in the UK and his studies would be of no value.  The judge did
    not explain what the exceptional circumstances are and why it would  be
    unjustifiably harsh not to allow this appeal under Article 8.

11. Miss Vidhyadharan  drew attention to Miah at paragraph 26 which states:-



         "26. For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal in  relation  to
             the near miss argument.  In my judgment, there is no near miss
             principle applicable to the Immigration Rules.  The  Secretary
             of State, and on appeal the Tribunal, must assess the strength
             of an Article 8 claim, but  the  requirements  of  immigration
             control is not weakened by the degree of  non-compliance  with
             the Immigration Rules."

12. Miss Vidhyadharan  submitted also that it is necessary to  have  regard
    to paragraphs 56 and 57 of Patel and Others [2013] UKSC 72 which  state
    as follows:-

         "56. Although the context of the  Rules  may  be  relevant  to  the
             consideration of proportionality, I agree with Burnton LJ that
             this cannot be  equated  with  a  formalised  'near  miss'  or
             'sliding scale' principle, as argued for by  Mr  Malik.   That
             approach is unsupported  by  Strasbourg  authority,  or  by  a
             proper reading of Lord Bingham's words.  Mrs Huang's case  for
             favourable treatment outside the Rules did  not  turn  on  how
             close she had come to compliance with Rule  317,  but  on  the
             application of the family values which underlie that Rule  and
             are at the heart also of Article 8.  Conversely, a  near  miss
             under the Rules cannot provide substance  to  a  human  rights
             case which is otherwise lacking in merit.

         57.  It is important to remember that Article 8 is  not  a  general
             dispensing  power.   It  is  to  be  distinguished  from   the
             Secretary of State's  discretion  to  allow  leave  to  remain
             outside the Rules, which may be  unrelated  to  any  protected
             human right.  The merits of a decision not to depart from  the
             Rules are not reviewable on appeal: Section  86(6).   One  may
             sympathise with Sedley LJ's call in Pankina for 'common sense'
             in the application of the Rules to  graduates  who  have  been
             studying in the UK for some years (see  paragraph  47  above).
             However, such considerations  do  not  by  themselves  provide
             grounds of appeal under Article 8,  which  is  concerned  with
             private  or  family  life,  not  education   as   such.    The
             opportunity for a promising student to complete his course  in
             this country, however desirable in general terms,  is  not  in
             itself a right protected under Article 8."

13. In his submissions Mr Qureshi stated that Article 8 was not  raised  in
    the grounds of appeal but in a letter  written  by  one  Martin  Donkin
    dated 28 June 2013 where it was explained that the appellant  submitted
    his notice of appeal himself without receiving advice and it was  there
    that the private life Article 8 claim was made.  Mr  Qureshi  submitted
    that the judge had given sound reasons for coming to his  decision  and
    directed himself properly.  It was for the Home Office to show that  it
    was proportionate to  interfere  with  the  appellant's  private  life.
    There was only one year left before the appellant  would  complete  his
    course and the importance of the  maintenance  of  immigration  control
    would not be weakened by the short period of him being allowed to  stay
    here.  The appellant came here  legally  and  he  is  not  a  dishonest
    person.  He has been supporting himself helped by his brother  and  has
    not been a burden on the state at all.  It would  be  a  punishment  to
    expel him at this stage and he referred to the  case  of  OA  (Nigeria)
    [2008] EWCA Civ 82 and that the consequences for the appellant  are  of
    sufficient gravity to engage Article 8.

14. In reply Miss Vidhyadharan stated that  the  appellant  has  still  not
    demonstrated why this was a truly exceptional case or why it  would  be
    unduly harsh for him not to continue with his  studies  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

The error of law decision

15. I announced my decision at the time that I found that the judge had not
    sufficiently reasoned his  decision  as  to  why  the  appellant  could
    succeed under Article 8 when he could not succeed under the Immigration
    Rules.  Unsurprisingly he made no reference to Patel as at the date  of
    hearing on 6 December 2013 Patel had only just been published.  It  may
    well be that his decision would have been  different  had  he  had  the
    benefit of reading that decision.

16. Having announced my decision after  a  brief  adjournment  the  resumed
    hearing took place and I heard evidence from the appellant.

17. The appellant gave his evidence in English.  He undertook a  foundation
    course in electrical engineering and at date of hearing  was  about  to
    take his second year exams.  His course is due to finish in June  2015.
    The course is not available in Pakistan as it consists of two elements,
    electrical and electronics.  In Pakistan he  could  study  one  or  the
    other but not both.  He  has  no  financial  difficulties  because  his
    brother is fortunate enough to be in a position  to  provide  for  him.
    The appellant explained that he has another �12,000  still  to  pay  in
    September to cover the remainder of his course.  After he has completed
    his education he plans to go back to obtain a job in Pakistan.   He  is
    engaged to be married to a girl there.  His parents,  two  sisters  and
    uncles etc. live in Pakistan.

18. Cross-examined by Miss Vidhyadharan the appellant said that he  has  no
    evidence with him to say that the degree he is  studying  here  is  not
    taught in Pakistan.  If it was it would not be of the same value  as  a
    degree obtained here.  He came to receive an  education  and  confirmed
    that he intended to return to Pakistan and the date for  doing  so  has
    been fixed.  This date is 20 August 2015 but he  was  not  one  hundred
    percent that this would be the date because  it  would  depend  on  the
    situation at the time.

19. I asked the appellant what his private life consisted of and he replied
    that he had come for education.

Submissions

20. Miss Vidhyadharan submitted that there was nothing unjustifiably  harsh
    about the decision.  The appellant came here for an education and there
    was nothing to  indicate  what  his  private  life  here  is.   He  had
    insufficient funds to meet the Rules at the time and although this  may
    only have been a near miss, as stated  in  Miah,  the  requirements  of
    immigration control are not weakened by the  degree  of  non-compliance
    with the Rules.

21. Mr Qureshi submitted that even though the Miah  case  may  be  relevant
    consideration of Article 8  is  not  excluded  and  he  relied  on  the
    submissions made by him at the error of law point in the hearing.

My Deliberations

22. It is not in doubt that the appellant did not meet the requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules at the date of his application.   As  the  First-
    tier Judge rightly pointed out the appellant knew the sum of money that
    was required for him to meet the requirements of the Rules  because  he
    himself inserted the correct amount  in  the  appropriate  box  in  the
    application form.  For whatever reason the required sum did not  remain
    in the account for the relevant period of 28 days and this  has  proved
    fatal to the application under the Rules.

23. I have already set out above paragraphs 56 and  57  of  Patel  and  the
    point is made there that the opportunity for  a  promising  student  to
    complete his course of education in  this  country,  however  desirable
    that may be, is not in itself a right protected under Article  8.   The
    appellant has said that he only came  here  to  receive  an  education.
    Details of his private life are scant.  His brother lives here  and  no
    doubt his brother's family also. It is likely that the appellant has  a
    family relationship with them and has made friends with fellow students
    and others.  He intends to return to Pakistan, he says,  after  he  has
    completed his engineering course in 2015.  He has given verbal evidence
    that there is no similar course available in Pakistan that  deals  with
    both electrical and electronic engineering but  he  had  no  supporting
    evidence for that assertion.

24. Such private life as the appellant has may be enjoyed in Pakistan  with
    his family and friends there and I find that there is no good  evidence
    before me that what he has studied here will  not  stand  him  in  good
    stead in the future in Pakistan.  Having taken  the  foundation  course
    and then applied for further leave the appellant was refused such leave
    in January 2013.  He has been prepared to take the  risk  it  seems  of
    continuing with his studies and paying out fees between  that  date  of
    refusal and up to date of hearing.

25. My conclusions are that in light of these facts and  in  particular  in
    light of Miah and also Patel the appellant has not shown that  this  is
    one of those few cases where there are any  compelling  or  exceptional
    circumstances, or words to that effect, that would amount to  a  breach
    of the appellant's Article 8 private  life  rights  by  dismissing  the
    appeal.

26. I only comment further that the Section 47 decision was  withdrawn.  If
    it is the intention of the respondent to remove the appellant  a  fresh
    decision will be made and the appellant may make further submissions as
    to why he should be allowed to remain.  It will of course then  be  for
    the respondent to  decide  in  her  discretion  whether  to  allow  the
    appellant to remain outside the Rules for a limited  or  other  period.
    That is entirely a matter for her.  However, and as things  stand,  for
    the reasons set out above this appeal fails.

Decision

27. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge  is  set  aside  for  the
    reasons given earlier in this determination.

28. The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules and under Article 8
    ECHR.  This is also for the reasons set out above.

29. Although I was not addressed on the matter of anonymity I see  no  need
    to make such a  direction  in  the  particular  circumstances  of  this
    appeal.

30. As a last point I note that the judge (at  paragraph  26)  made  a  fee
    award.  It is entirely unclear on what basis he decided to make such an
    award and it seems all the more surprising that he has done so  without
    giving reasons when the appeal was dismissed under the  Rules  entirely
    through the actions of the appellant.  However, I was not addressed  on
    the point.
