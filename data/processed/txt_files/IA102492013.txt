For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. In this appeal the  Secretary  of  State  now  becomes  the  appellant.
    However, for the sake of clarity  and  to  avoid  confusion,  we  shall
    continue to refer to the parties as they  were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 2. At the hearing before us there was no appearance by  the  appellant  or
    representation on his behalf.  In a letter faxed to the Tribunal on the
    day before the hearing the appellant indicated that he would be  unable
    to attend court on the following day because his wife's grandmother had
    passed away and he had to attend her funeral.  An Upper Tribunal  Judge
    refused the request on the same day indicating that the  judge  hearing
    the appeal would consider whether the determination of  the  First-tier
    Judge revealed a material error and then, if so,  decide  what  further
    action to take.  If necessary, it would consider whether  it  would  be
    appropriate to adjourn the appeal.

 3.  As  indicated  below,  we  first  considered  whether   or   not   the
    determination showed an error on a point of law such that it should  be
    re-made.  Having concluded that it did, we  decided  it  would  not  be
    necessary to adjourn the appeal in order to re-make the  decision.   In
    reaching that conclusion, we took into consideration the submission  by
    Mr McVeety that the appellant's application to  adjourn  had  not  been
    supported by his stated representatives, Usman Khan Solicitors, and did
    not give a reason for the failure to  attend  which  was  supported  by
    evidence. Additionally, before proceeding, we arranged  for  the  court
    clerk to contact the representatives by phone but  they  could  not  be
    reached on the number given. In the circumstances, we  considered  that
    it was not in the interests of justice to further  adjourn  the  appeal
    and continued to hear it applying the provisions  of  Rule  38  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

Error on a Point of Law

 4. In a renewed application to the Upper Tribunal,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Taylor  gave  permission  to  the  respondent  to  appeal  against  the
    determination of First-Tier Tribunal Judge  Frankish  who  allowed  the
    appeal against the decision of the respondent to refuse leave to remain
    in the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant  under  the
    points-based system.

 5. When granting permission, Upper Tribunal Judge Taylor  noted  that  the
    grounds  of  application  by  the  respondent  argued  that  the  judge
    misdirected himself because he took into  account  evidence  which  was
    sent to the respondent by the appellant later and separately  from  the
    application, even if on the same day.  The respondent argued  that  the
    appellant was not permitted to do so by virtue of paragraph  34A(vi)(a)
    of the Immigration Rules which required that the application had to  be
    accompanied by documents specified  as  mandatory  in  the  application
    form.  Upper Tribunal Judge Taylor considered  that  the  grounds  were
    arguable.

 6. It should be noted that the  grounds  also  contended  that  the  judge
    failed to have regard to  the  provisions  of  Section  85A(4)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  because  he  was  only
    permitted by that Section to take  account  of  evidence  submitted  in
    support of, and at the time of making, the application.  It was further
    contended that the additional  evidence  from  the  appellant  was  not
    submitted when the application was made as it was  not  submitted  with
    the application when posted.

 7. Mr McVeety confirmed that the respondent relied upon the grounds  which
    we have summarised, above.  He  emphasised  that,  although  the  judge
    found that the appellant had submitted the bank documents  in  question
    on the same day he submitted his application, that did  not  mean  that
    the determination was without error because the appellant had failed to
    comply with the specific provisions of the Rules.

 8. The appellant has not provided a response pursuant to rule 24   but  we
    noted his contention in the grounds of appeal to the F-tT that  he  had
    paid the fees for his course although the issue of the late  submission
    of bank information was not raised at that stage. The  fees  issue  was
    resolved at the hearing when the Presenting Officer conceded  that  the
    amount which the appellant had to  show  as  available  was  �1,600  as
    maintenance although that sum was not available in his UK bank account.
    The appellant then submitted that he had sent, on the same day  as  his
    completed application, a statement for an account with United  Bank  in
    Pakistan which showed sufficient funds to cover the �1,600 required  to
    be shown

 9.  Having considered the matter, we announced that we were satisfied that
    the determination showed an error on a point of law such that it should
    be re-made and now give our reasons for doing so.

10. The issue for our consideration was whether or not  the  judge  was  in
    material error in concluding that  he  could  take  into  consideration
    evidence submitted by the appellant in  the  form  of  bank  statements
    showing overseas funds which, he found, were  sent  to  the  respondent
    separately to, but on the same day as, the  application  for  leave  to
    remain, itself. We  find  the  judge's  decision  in  relation  to  the
    despatch of the additional evidence somewhat unusual  because  he  does
    not appear to  have  investigated  the  fact  that  that  the  original
    evidence from United Bank in Pakistan was dated 15th December 2012 when
    the leave application was only two days later. There was no evidence of
    despatch of that evidence either from Pakistan or  to  the  respondent.
    However we do not disturb that finding; our task  is  to  consider  the
    error which is the subject of the application.

11. In considering the error issue, we were mindful of the Court of  Appeal
    decision in Raju and Others [2013] EWCA Civ 754  which  overturned  the
    Upper Tribunal decision in Khatel [2013] UKUT 44 (IAC).  The  Court  of
    Appeal concluded that an application for leave is made  when  paragraph
    34G of the Immigration Rules says it is made and is not  a  "continuing
    application" to the date upon which it is decided  by  the  respondent.
    We focused upon the issue raised in these two  reported  cases  on  the
    basis that, although not specifically  considered  by  the  judge,  the
    appellant's application could have been seen as a continuing one and so
    the respondent's argument in relation to the application  of  paragraph
    34A of the Immigration Rules might not have been conclusive.   However,
    the decision of the Court of Appeal is clear and so the application  in
    this case could not  have  been  regarded  as  a  continuing  one  thus
    permitting the later submission of a bank statement.

12. The determination of the First-tier Judge shows an error on a point  of
    law because  he   failed  to  consider  the  application  of  paragraph
    34A(vi)(a) which clearly required that an application submitted by post
    or courier or in person must be accompanied by the documents  specified
    as mandatory in the application form. In that context we  have  applied
    the ordinary meaning of the word "accompanied" which is "be present  or
    occur at the same time as".  Such documents  would  have  included  the
    bank statements showing that the appellant had sufficient funds  abroad
    to demonstrate that he had the requisite �1,600 for  a  28  day  period
    preceding his application.  The  judge  also  failed  to  consider  the
    application of  Section  85A  of  the  2002  Act  in  conjunction  with
    consideration of paragraph 34A of the Rules which meant that he had not
    considered whether he could consider the documents submitted  later  as
    evidence at all.  If the judge had considered these two matters then it
    cannot be said that he  would,  nevertheless,  have  reached  the  same
    decision.

Re-Making the Determination

13. Having announced our decision on the error  in  the  determination,  we
    indicated that we would dismiss the appeal on re-making it  because  of
    the matters already examined. In doing so we also noted  that,  as  the
    judge commented in paragraph 9 of the determination, the results of the
    appeal had become academic to the appellant because he had achieved his
    masters degree on 20th July 2013 albeit that he did not  want  a  black
    mark on his immigration record.

14. We have concluded that the appeal must be dismissed  because,  applying
    the provisions of paragraph 34A(vi)(a) of the  Immigration  Rules,  the
    bank information which the appellant later sent did not  accompany  his
    original postal application.  We also point out that we  are  precluded
    from considering the information  which  he  later  submitted,  in  any
    event, because of the application of Section 85A(4) of the 2002 Act.

15. No human rights issues were raised in the original grounds of appeal or
    in relation to the application.

DECISION

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  on
a point of law.  We set aside the decision and re-make it by  dismissing  it
on immigration grounds.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity order nor do  we  consider
it appropriate to do so.
