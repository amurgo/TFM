For the Appellant:           Mr E. Waheed, City Heights Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T. Melvin,  Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Bangladesh born in 1975. He appeals with
    permission against the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Malcolm) to dismiss his protection appeal.


 2. The crux of the Appellant's claim was that he is a member  of  the  BNP
    who faces a real risk of  persecution  for  reasons  of  his  political
    opinion. The crux of the Respondent's case was that this  was  a  claim
    devoid of credibility, not least because the Appellant had  spent  five
    years in the United Kingdom before  deciding  he  needed  international
    protection.  The First-tier Tribunal preferred  the  latter  submission
    and dismissed the appeal.

 3. On the 17th  September  2019  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Sheridan  granted
    permission to appeal to this Tribunal, finding  it  arguable  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal had erred in placing the  'section  8'  credibility
    factors at the heart of its assessment.  Before me the Appellant relies
    on this limb of his challenge, as well as a number of other  criticisms
    that appear under the heading 'reasoning/perversity'.



    Section 8

 4. Section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment  of  Claimants  etc)
    Act 2004 (insofar as it is material to this appeal) reads:



         8 Claimant's credibility

         (1) In determining whether to believe a statement made by or on
         behalf of a person who makes an asylum claim or a human rights
         claim, a deciding authority shall take account, as damaging the
         claimant's credibility, of any behaviour to which this section
         applies.

         (2) This section applies to any behaviour by the claimant that the
         deciding authority thinks-

         (a) is designed or likely to conceal information,

         (b) is designed or likely to mislead, or

         (c) is designed or likely to obstruct or delay the handling or
         resolution of the claim or the taking of a decision in relation to
         the claimant.

         (3) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (2) the
         following kinds of behaviour shall be treated as designed or likely
         to conceal information or to mislead-

         (a) failure without reasonable explanation to produce a passport on
         request to an immigration officer or to the Secretary of State,

         (b) the production of a document which is not a valid passport as
         if it were,

         (c) the destruction, alteration or disposal, in each case without
         reasonable explanation, of a passport,

         (d) the destruction, alteration or disposal, in each case without
         reasonable explanation, of a ticket or other document connected
         with travel, and

         (e) failure without reasonable explanation to answer a question
         asked by a deciding authority.

         (4)  This section also applies to failure by the claimant to take
         advantage of a reasonable opportunity to make an asylum claim or
         human rights claim while in a safe country.

         (5) This section also applies to failure by the claimant to make an
         asylum claim or human rights claim before being notified of an
         immigration decision, unless the claim relies wholly on matters
         arising after the notification.



 5. In JT (Cameroon) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2008]
    EWCA Civ 878 the Court of Appeal gave the  following  guidance  on  the
    interpretation of that provision:


         19. Section 8 can, in my judgment, be construed in a way which does
         not offend against constitutional principles. It  plainly  has  its
         dangers, first, if it is read as a direction as to how fact-finding
         should be conducted, which in my judgment it is not,  and,  in  any
         event,  in  distorting  the  fact-finding  exercise  by  an   undue
         concentration on minutiae which may arise under the section at  the
         expense of, and as  a  distraction  from,  an  overall  assessment.
         Decision-makers should guard against that. A global  assessment  of
         credibility is required (R (Sivakumar) v Secretary of State for the
         Home Department 2003 UKHL 14, [2003] 1 WLR 840).


         20. I am not prepared to read the word "shall"  as  meaning  "may".
         The section 8 factors shall be  taken  into  account  in  assessing
         credibility, and are capable of damaging it, but the  section  does
         not dictate that relevant damage to credibility inevitably results.
         Telling lies does damage credibility and the wording  was  adopted,
         probably with that in mind, by way of explanation. However,  it  is
         the "behaviour" of which "account" shall be taken and, in  context,
         the qualifying word "potentially" can be read into  an  explanatory
         clause which  reads:  "as  damaging  the  claimant's  credibility".
         Alternatively,  the  explanatory  clause  may  be  read  as:  "when
         assessing any damage to the claimant's credibility".  The  form  of
         the sub-section and Parliament's assumed regard for  the  principle
         of legality permit that construction.


         21. Section 8 can  thus  be  construed  as  not  offending  against
         constitutional principles. It is no more than a reminder  to  fact-
         finding tribunals that conduct coming within the categories  stated
         in section 8 shall be taken into account in assessing  credibility.
         If there was a  tendency  for  tribunals  simply  to  ignore  these
         matters when assessing credibility,  they  were  in  error.  It  is
         necessary to take account of them.  However,  at  one  end  of  the
         spectrum, there may, unusually, be cases in which  conduct  of  the
         kind identified in section 8 is held to carry no weight at  all  in
         the overall assessment of credibility on the particular facts. I do
         not consider the section prevents that finding  in  an  appropriate
         case.  Subject  to  that,  I  respectfully  agree   with   Baroness
         Scotland's assessment, when introducing the Bill, of the effect  of
         section 8. Where section 8 matters are held to be entitled to  some
         weight, the weight to be given to them is entirely a matter for the
         fact-finder.


 6. In this case  the  behaviour  which  the  Respondent  replied  upon  as
    engaging section 8 was as follows:


              i) The failure to claim asylum on arrival in 2010 (despite now
                 claiming that in the year before  he  left  Bangladesh  his
                 home was attacked and was subject to a botched kidnapping);


             ii) Failure to mention in his 2012 application for human rights
                 leave that he had any political problems in Bangladesh;

            iii) Ditto in his evidence for his 2014 human rights  appeal  in
                 which he simply said that his family had been the victim of
                 criminal extortion by 'miscreant hooligans';

             iv) Ditto in his April 2015 human rights application.


 7. From these facts the First-tier Tribunal drew  negative  inference.  As
    the legislation and jurisprudence make clear, it was plainly  entitled,
    indeed obliged, to  do  so.  The  question  is  whether  that  negative
    inference in effect determined the appeal.
 8. It is right to say that the 'section 8 issues' did attract  significant
    weight in the balancing exercise. As Mr Waheed points out the reasoning
    starts with the delay in claiming asylum [from �101 on], dwells  on  it
    [at �102-110], and finishes by returning to the issue [at �117-119].  I
    am not however satisfied that this was an error of law.


 9. The duty upon the First-tier Tribunal is to assess the evidence in  the
    round. Even before parliament approved the legislation in 2004  it  was
    of course incumbent on decision makers to look at all of  the  relevant
    circumstances.   If a claim for asylum was made late in the  day,  when
    all other avenues were closed, that would plainly  be  relevant.  If  a
    claimant failed to take a number of opportunities to advance the claim,
    that too could legitimately be weighed in the balance.  If  a  claimant
    said one thing in one context, and another in  the  asylum  claim,  the
    discrepancy would  be  worthy  of  note.    If  we  set  the  statutory
    obligation  to  one  side,  and  simply  read  the  reasoning  in  this
    determination without reference to s8 or the jurisprudence on  it,  the
    judge's decision would be perfectly legitimate.

10. Furthermore it is clear that the 'section 8 issues' were not  the  only
    matters taken into account by the Tribunal:  other matters that weighed
    against the Appellant were the concerns about the  credibility  of  the
    FIRs,  the  timing  and  nature  of  the  emails  from  his  wife,  the
    discrepancies in the evidence about when he joined  the  BNP,  and  the
    timing and circumstances of his re-ignited political activity.

11. Taking all of that together the Judge was entitled to reason that  this
    was a man who had failed to seek international protection over  a  five
    year period, despite now claiming to  have  been  targeted  before  and
    after his arrival  here,  whose  documentary  evidence  and  sur  place
    activity all curiously coincided with the end of the road in  terms  of
    his repeated human rights claims, and whose evidence was  inconsistent.
    Even applying the lower standard of proof the  Judge  was  entitled  to
    find that these factors prevented the Appellant  from  discharging  the
    lower standard of proof.



    The Other Grounds: 'Reasons/Perversity'


12. The grounds submit that there is  no  inconsistency  in  the  Appellant
    having told Judge Blake in 2014 that his wife  in  Bangladesh  was  the
    subject of extortion demands by 'miscreants' and these 'miscreants' now
    being recast as  Awami  league  activists  on  a  politically-motivated
    campaign of harassment and  intimidation.   I  reject  that.  There  is
    plainly an inconsistency. The Appellant was in 2014  pursuing  a  human
    rights claim to be able to remain in the United Kingdom,  and  part  of
    that case was  that  he  has  problems  in  Bangladesh.    It  was  his
    opportunity to articulate his evidence on that point and this is how he
    did that:


         "The Appellant claimed that he could not make  an  application  for
         asylum as he was receiving threats not from the State authority but
         from private miscreants who had  no  power  and  money  to  control
         everything. He claimed that the police were mere spectators".


    Now the Appellant asserts that the miscreants were acting at the behest
    of the government, and that the police are complicit in their  campaign
    of persecution. That is a discrepancy that the Tribunal was entitled to
    weigh against him.


13. The next point raised in the grounds concerns the email from  his  wife
    which allegedly prompted the Appellant to claim  asylum.  The  Tribunal
    clearly considered it peculiar that the Appellant's wife had chosen  to
    communicate urgent information to him (that he was now  wanted  by  the
    Dhaka police) by way of email rather than  a  telephone  call;  it  was
    peculiar because up until that point they had regularly communicated by
    phone. The Tribunal concluded that this 'self-serving' email  had  been
    produced simply to bolster the claim. Whilst there is obvious scope for
    criticism of the term 'self-serving' in this instance it may in fact be
    apposite. The point the judge makes is that there was  no  good  reason
    for that information to be relayed by email other than the fact that it
    could later be produced in an  asylum  appeal.  That  was  an  entirely
    reasonable conclusion for him to have drawn.


14. Next the grounds address the matter of  the  FIRs.  The  Appellant  had
    produced a series of documents purportedly issued by the authorities in
    Bangladesh showing him to be wanted for various crimes.  The  Secretary
    of State had subjected these documents to verification checks and found
    them to be forged. The  Appellant  had  responded  by  submitting  more
    documents from Bangladesh, namely  correspondence  from  a  lawyer  who
    questioned the methodology employed  by  the  Secretary  of  State  and
    maintained that his checks had shown the documents to be genuine.   The
    First-tier Tribunal, perhaps wisely, sidestepped this entire  issue  by
    simply saying this: "I find that the timing of  the  provision  of  the
    First Information Reports calls into question  the  validity  of  these
    reports". Mr Waheen complains that as this was a whole new  reason  for
    doubting the veracity of the documents the Appellant should  have  been
    given an opportunity to respond to it. I reject that. The point is that
    the Secretary of State squarely submitted that these documents had been
    faked in order to support an entirely bogus asylum claim. The Appellant
    was well aware that this was the position, and that  the  Secretary  of
    State was further submitting that the timing of the  entire  claim  was
    highly suspect. No issue of  unfairness  arises,  since  the  Appellant
    understood that this was the challenge, and that  it  was  for  him  to
    prove his case.
15. For those reasons I am not satisfied that any error arises in the First-
    tier Tribunal disposal of this appeal and  the  Appellant's  appeal  is
    dismissed.



    Decisions


16. I find no error of law and the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  is
    upheld.

17. This appeal concerns a claim for protection.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"
