For the Respondent:      Ms Gough, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1) This determination refers to parties  as  they  were  in  the  First-tier
   Tribunal.

2) The appellant identifies herself as a  citizen  of  Nigeria,  born  on  1
   January 1989.

3) At  Edinburgh  Airport  on  20  March  2013  the  respondent  issued  the
   appellant with the following decision:

    You hold a current visa and have asked for leave to enter the UK  as  a
    visitor for 2 weeks but I am satisfied that a change  of  circumstances
    has taken place ... removing the basis of your claim to admission ...


    I have reached this decision based on a number  of  factors  including;
    you have now informed us that  are  approximately  20  weeks  pregnant.
    Furthermore, I am not satisfied that  you  are  able  to  maintain  and
    accommodate yourself without recourse to employment  or  public  funds.
    The financial outlay on your proposed visit for the  reasons  you  have
    given is  not  commensurate  with  your  current  social  and  economic
    circumstances.


    When applying for the visa you stated you had �1,500 available for your
    trip.  However ... since discovering you  are  pregnant  much  of  this
    money has been used for accommodation for you and your  baby  ....  You
    have stated that the motivation behind the trip is  to  purchase  goods
    for yourself and your baby and have �600 available  to  do  this.   You
    have stated that you intend to visit the Louis  Vuitton  shop  although
    you do not know where this is and you intent to purchase gloves,  shoes
    and a handbag for yourself ... at approximately �200.  ... You wish  to
    visit Mothercare and purchase various  items  for  your  baby.   Beyond
    these 2 shops you appeared to lack any knowledge of what the UK has  to
    offer a genuine visitor.  You have confirmed that  the  trip  cost  you
    �790 ... the equivalent of 3 months full income.


    ...  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  and  given  the   change   of
    circumstances I am not satisfied that you are genuinely  seeking  entry
    as a visitor for the limited period as stated by you ...


    I therefore refuse you entry to the UK under paragraph 43 of HC395 ...


4) Directions were given for the appellant's removal to Lagos  on  29  March
   2013.  She was also notified that  if  she  appealed  she  would  not  be
   required to leave the UK while the appeal was in progress.  Her notice of
   appeal is dated 25 and marked as received by the FtT on  28  March  2013.
   In her grounds she says that she would be  staying  with  her  uncle  and
   therefore  able  to  maintain  and  accommodate  herself,  and  that  her
   pregnancy should not have been seen as a change  of  circumstances.   She
   attaches a copy letter from an obstetrician in  Nigeria,  dated  March  5
   2013, confirming that she was expected to deliver on 15 July 2013.

5) The appellant did not seek an oral hearing.  Her case came  for  decision
   "on the papers" before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Thornton,  who  allowed
   her appeal by determination promulgated on 28 October  2013.   The  judge
   said at paragraph 12 that  pregnancy  did  not  constitute  a  change  of
   circumstances.  At paragraph 13, the judge noted that the  appellant  had
   advised that she had given birth to twin girls on 6 July 2013,  and  went
   on:

    However, first, I may only consider the circumstances  appertaining  at
    the time of the decision to refuse.  Secondly, the notice of refusal of
    leave to enter informed her that ... she would not be required to leave
    the UK while the appeal was in progress.  Therefore, the fact that  the
    appellant has remained in the UK ... cannot be taken  into  account  in
    considering whether the respondent has discharged the burden  of  proof
    ... in relation to the ... decision to refuse leave to enter. ...


    ... The respondent has failed to prove that there has been a change  of
    circumstances since entry clearance was issued  that  had  removed  the
    basis of the appellant's claim to admission.


6) The Immigration Officer appeals to the Upper Tribunal  on  the  following
   grounds:

    ... To meet the requirements  for  leave  to  enter  as  a  visitor  an
    intention to leave at the end of the visit must be  demonstrated.   The
    appellant was not pregnant when she made her application, therefore the
    Entry Clearance Officer did not have the opportunity to consider how it
    may affect her intentions ... the judge has not adequately reasoned his
    finding that the appellant's pregnancy has no bearing on her intentions
    as a visitor ...


7) The appellant did not appear and was  not  represented  before  us.   The
   file showed that notice of the hearing was sent to her at the address she
   most recently notified to the tribunal.  The Presenting  Officer  had  no
   information about any further change of address, and no information  that
   the appellant might have left the country.  We proceeded with the hearing
   under Rule 38 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

8) The appellant had by the time of arrival in the  UK  spent  much  of  the
   money she originally said she had available for her trip.  That alone was
   a  change  of  circumstances  which  at  least  warranted   enquiry   and
   consideration by the Immigration Officer.  The judge overlooked that.

9) The judge was wrong to consider  that  pregnancy  did  not  constitute  a
   change of circumstances.  The basis of the appellant's claim to admission
   was that she intended only a short visit.  The fact that she was now  due
   to give birth was capable of altering that.

10) The judge was right to  note  that  the  onus  was  on  the  Immigration
   Officer, and that the judge was to  take  account  of  the  circumstances
   appertaining at the time of the decision under appeal.  However,  it  was
   relevant  to  consider  post-decision  facts  throwing   light   on   the
   circumstances as at that date.

11) In her communication to the tribunal of  15  July  2013,  the  appellant
   gave an address in Dundee, and  advised  that  she  had  given  birth  by
   caesarean section, and was still under medical supervision.  She did  not
   say that the births had taken place  at  private  expense,  or  that  any
   National Health Service costs had been reimbursed.  What is known of  her
   financial circumstances suggests that she is rather unlikely to have paid
   such expenses.

12) The judge's reasons for allowing the appeal were these  -  pregnancy  is
   not a change of circumstances; later circumstances were  irrelevant;  and
   remaining in the UK  was  irrelevant.   The  first  two  reasons  do  not
   withstand scrutiny.  The judge  also  failed  to  notice  the  change  of
   circumstances in that much  of  the  available  money  was  spent  before
   arrival.

13) It may have been  proper  to  disregard  the  fact  that  the  appellant
   remained in the UK.  She was not obliged to  do  so,  but  had  she  left
   before the determination of her appeal it would have been deemed to  have
   been abandoned under s. 104.  She would have lost the chance of remedying
   her immigration record.

14) In light of all the above, we are satisfied that the judge did not  give
   sustainable reasons for the decision, and ought to  have  held  that  the
   respondent had established change of circumstances such as to remove  the
   basis of the appellant's claim to admission.

15) We allow the Immigration Officer's appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.   The
   First-tier Tribunal  determination  is  set  aside.   We  substitute  the
   following decision:  the appellant's appeal, as originally brought to the
   First-tier Tribunal, is dismissed.
