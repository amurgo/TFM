                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, a national of Afghanistan, date  of  birth  6  September
    1943, appealed against the ECO's decision dated 5 August 2015 to refuse
    entry clearance as an adult dependent relative under Appendix FM of the
    Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended). Her appeal was dismissed by  F-t
    T Judge Paul (the Judge) on 25 April 2017.  Permission  to  appeal  was
    given by F-t T Andrew on 31 May 2017. The Secretary of State ,on behalf
    of the ECO made a Rule24 response on the 20 June 2017

2.   Refusal was on essentially three bases the first of which is no  longer
    significant in relation to the relationship between the Sponsor and his
    mother.  The second basis of refusal was that the Appellant had  failed
    to satisfy the requirements of paragraph E-ECDR.2.4, which states: "The
    applicant or, if the applicant and  their  partner  are  the  Sponsor's
    parents or grandparents, the applicant's partner, must as a  result  of
    age, illness or disability require long-term personal care  to  perform
    everyday tasks."  Refusal was also effectively  with  reference  to  E-
    ECDR.2.5, which provides that the Appellant is unable,  even  with  the
    practical and financial help of the Sponsor,  to  obtain  the  required
    level of care in Afghanistan, where they are living, because "(a) it is
    not available and there is no person in that country who can reasonably
    provide it; or (b) it is not affordable."  There is no issue  that  (b)
    is not pertinent.

3.   It was accepted by  Mr  Bramble,  wholly  correctly,  that  the  Judge,
    simply failed to address the correct version of the  provisions  within
    the Rules, particularly paragraph E-ECDR.2.4.   It  was  argued  by  Mr
    Bramble that in any event the Judge looked at the evidence  and  whilst
    not correctly referring to the right Rules nevertheless applied them as
    a fact.  Therefore there was no arguable material error  of  law  which
    would mean that a different outcome of the appeal would be reached.

3.   Whilst the Judge said, of the matter,  that  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules were clear: He thereafter made it plain he did not understand the
    Rules or apply them.  Nevertheless the Judge does correctly summarise E-
    ECDR.2.4 at least so far as stating "... The Appellant  would  have  to
    demonstrate that the Appellant  required  long-term  personal  care  to
    perform everyday tasks."  He does also recite  in  its  generality  the
    question of whether or not care could be  provided  by  an  appropriate
    person in  Kabul.   However,  at  paragraph  16  of  the  decision  the
    reasoning elides to mix the two points together:  The  Judge  concluded
    that the Appellant had not crossed a threshold  of  requiring  24  hour
    care to help her conduct normal tasks but reached no conclusion on  the
    reasonableness of the care that could be provided, which was  an  issue
    clearly raised by the Sponsor  before  the  Judge.  Unfortunately,  the
    Judge did not  really  consider  reasonableness  he  simply  asked  the
    question as to whether or not care is available, not was there a person
    who could provide it i.e. at a reasonable level of care, which  is  the
    second part of the limb of paragraph ECHR 2.5(a).

4.   I have looked at the decision as a whole  and  it  is  clear  that  the
    Judge received the evidence from the Sponsor.  He recited that evidence
    and indeed the evidence that confirmed the Appellant's ill health.  The
    Judge does not doubt that evidence or even criticise it in terms of the
    views expressed  by  the  Sponsor  concerning  either  the  Appellant's
    health, her worsening condition, the problems of caring for  her  on  a
    daily basis and the difficulties of  obtaining  such  appropriate  care
    from third parties.  For reasons that I do not  speculate,  having  not
    criticised  the  Sponsor's  evidence  on  material  issues  I  do   not
    understand the Judge's reasoning as to why at least the questions could
    not be better addressed than they were.

5.   It  seemed  to  me  the  critical  element  is  the  reasonableness  of
    obtaining the  care  provided  to  the  appropriate  standard  that  is
    undoubtedly fact-driven.

6.   In these circumstances I am satisfied that the Original  Tribunal  made
    a material error of law in the reasoning and  the  Original  Tribunal's
    decision cannot stand.

7.   In the circumstances the parties are agreed  that  I  can  remake  this
    matter and do so taking into account a second witness statement made by
    the Sponsor, dated 7 July 2017.  The Sponsor, a British national,  date
    of birth 30 November 1972, both adopted his earlier witness  statement,
    of 27 March 2017, to which I have referred but also identified how  his
    continued presence was necessary to care for his mother in Afghanistan:
    But that he had the particular financial burden  of  managing  his  own
    life, his employment, more particularly the care of his mother and  its
    costs over in Afghanistan.  There are also practical difficulties  over
    his being able to communicate with his family in the UK.

8.   I therefore, for my own part, conclude that the Sponsor  met  paragraph
    E-ECDR.2.3 of Appendix FM and I find that, on  the  evidence  that  was
    before the Judge, and before me it is clear  his  mother  does  require
    long-term personal care to perform everyday tasks.  I find further that
    the attempts which have been made  including  using  third  parties  as
    opposed to simply the Sponsor's efforts have shown  that  the  required
    and reasonable level of care is not available to  this  lady  with  her
    serious health conditions and that there is no-one in the  country  who
    can reasonably provide it: Bearing in mind it is 24 hour care needs  to
    be called upon.  The fact is that the jobs which the Sponsor  has  done
    spoken  to  in  his  statement  of  27  March  2017   have   been   the
    responsibility of others, including another family member when she  was
    present there, but when in the hands of third parties quite simply  the
    care has not been of a reasonable standard.  In those  circumstances  I
    take into account the evidence from the  hospital,  Appellant's  bundle
    (A18), which confirms that  the  Appellant  suffers  from  a  range  of
    illnesses including  hypercholesterolaemia,  hypertension,  Alzheimer's
    disease and high depression.  It also confirms given the nature of  her
    illnesses and the fact that in the past she has failed to properly self-
    medicate it is suggested that she is looked after by a carer  and/or  a
    member of her family to ensure her wellbeing  and  her  recovery.   The
    letter continues: "She is elderly, fragile and requires regular  intake
    of medication therefore, failure in monitoring her closely  may  result
    in further complications in her condition."

9.   The hospital affirms that they have done what they  can  but  that  the
    Appellant no longer requires the environment of the hospital but rather
    the close practical and emotional  support  and  assistance  which  she
    needs on a daily basis.  In those circumstances I find on the  evidence
    bearing in mind the apparent high  threshold  being  applied  under  E-
    ECDR.2.5  that  nevertheless  the  Appellant  has  adduced   sufficient
    evidence  to  discharge  the  burden  of  proof  upon  a   balance   of
    probabilities that she meets the requirements of  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  I  therefore  consider  the  present  circumstances
    warrant consideration of Article 8 ECHR.I do so in the context  of  the
    consideration of Section 117A-117B of the NIAA 2002 as amended. At  the
    age of the Appellant and given her health she  will  be  supported  and
    cared for by family in the UK.  It does not seem likely that  she  will
    need English language skills or to work in the UK or be taking steps to
    integrate here. I apply the approaches set out in Razgar [2004] UKHL 24
    and Huang [2007] UKHL 11.

10.   I find private/family life rights are engaged and the  ECO's  decision
    to refuse entry is a  significant  interference  with  Article  8  ECHR
    rights for the Appellant to be reunited with her family in  the  UK.  I
    find the  ECO's  decision  is  lawful  and  serves  Article  8(2)  ECHR
    purposes. I find the appellant ability to comply with the  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules is a material consideration. In  this  case  I
    find the public interest is  outweighed  by  the  Appellant's  personal
    circumstances. I find the ECO's decision is disproportionate
