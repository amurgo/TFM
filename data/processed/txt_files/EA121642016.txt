Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    None


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   In a decision of 29 August 2017 (which followed a hearing on 29  August
    2017), I set aside the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  (FtT)  Judge
    Mailer sent on 17 February 2017 allowing the appeal of  the  respondent
    (hereafter the claimant). The claimant had  appealed  to  Judge  Mailer
    against the decision made by the appellant (hereafter "the  Immigration
    Officer" ("IO")) on 12 September 2016 to refuse him admission to the UK
    under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 on  the
    grounds that he is an EEA national from  Ireland  whose  exclusion  was
    justified on serious grounds of public policy.

2.   At the hearing  there  was  no  appearance  by  or  on  behalf  of  the
    claimant.  Mr Whitwell represented the IO. In view of the lack  of  any
    communication with the Tribunal I decided to exercise my discretion  to
    hear the appeal in the absence of one of the  parties.   I  then  heard
    brief submissions from Mr Whitwell in the course of which he  submitted
    that the IO's reference  to  "serious"  was  a  typing  error.   In  my
    subsequent written decision, having set aside  the  decision  of  Judge
    Mailer, I issued the following directions:

         "DIRECTIONS


            I am not presently in  a  position  to  re-make  the  decision.
         Before I proceed to re-make the decision, I direct that  within  28
         days from this decision being sent:


         1)   The IO serve on the Tribunal with a copy  to  the  claimant  a
             written statement confirming whether or not  the  use  of  the
             word 'serious' in the exclusion decision was  a  typographical
             error and clarifying the basis  on  which  the  exclusion  was
             made.  (I have already received the interview record  from  Mr
             Whitwell but the respondent should also serve a  copy  on  the
             claimant.)


         2)   The  claimant  serves  on  the  Tribunal  (with  copy  to  the
             appellant) any probation or any other similar report (if  any)
             in existence prior to 17 February 2017 in support of his claim
             that he has been categorised as a "low risk" of re-offending."


3.   In response Mr Whitwell for the IO  sent  a  Police  National  Computer
    check particularising the  claimant's  criminal  offending  in  Ireland
    which was said to support the IO's description of  the  length  of  the
    claimant's sentence. This record showed that  the  claimant  had  first
    been convicted on 29 November 2013 for 5 sexual offences for  which  he
    received sentences of 3 years imprisonment for the first offence and  4
    years consecutive for the second and third (being bound over in respect
    of the third for 7 years). The record also documented that his overseas
    conviction made Mr Nolan liable for Visor Registration if in the UK. Mr
    Whitwell also included an email from the Stanstead Command Border Force
    Casework Team stating in respect of the claimant that:

             "It has been established from interviewing Mr  Nolan  that  at
         the time of his refusal he had  been  residing  in  the  UK  for  3
         months,  as  such  he  would  not  have  qualified  for   permanent
         residence. Border Force  Stanstead  therefore  maintains  that  the
         Appellant's conduct constitutes 'serious' grounds for refusal, this
         is not a concession as to the [claimant's] acquisition of permanent
         residence and we consider that the [claimant]  is  to  be  assessed
         against  the  baseline  level  of  protection  afforded  under  the
         Regulations, which even taking that  into  account,  his  exclusion
         remains justified".


4.   From the claimant, the Upper Tribunal received two letters,  one  dated
    22 September 2017 the other 2  October  2017,  the  latter  essentially
    correcting the dating of the former. The  latter,  headed,  "Letter  of
    Clarification",  from  Forensic   Psychological   Services,   Kilkenny,
    Ireland, stated that it had carried out 2 risk assessments, one in 2014
    and one in 2015. In  2014  Mr  Nolan's  level  of  risk  "was  assessed
    actuarially as this provided an objective measure of the likelihood  of
    his committing a sexual offence in the future. Mr Nolan's overall level
    of risk of re-offending in the future was deemed to  be  moderate-low".
    The letter added that Mr Nolan's risk of future  sexual  offending  was
    reassessed using the same instruments, in 2015. It was noted  that  his
    "risk of future sexual acting out had reduced at that point in time and
    was reassessed as being in the low risk range". Contributing factors to
    this assessment were stated as being:  his  capacity  for  relationship
    stability; his  general  social  withdrawal  and  rejection;  his  poor
    problem-solving skills; his negative  emotionality;  and  the  age  and
    gender of the victim. This letter, signed by a Senior  Counselling  and
    Forensic Psychologist, concluded by stating that "[i]t is  likely  that
    Mr Nolan's poor problem-solving skills, rather than dishonesty  on  his
    part, contributed to his failure to notify the necessary  professionals
    of his relocation to England".

5.   I did not envisage when issuing my further directions that there  would
    be a need for a further oral hearing and the responses I have  received
    from the parties enable me to proceed to re-make the  decision  on  the
    papers.

6.   The claimant was convicted in November 2003 in Ireland of  five  counts
    of sexual assault of a minor (his son) aged 14.  He received a sentence
    of four years which resulted in him being placed on the  sex  offenders
    register in Ireland and subject  to  the  requirements  therein,  which
    included notifying the  Garda  of  his  change  of  address  (including
    outside of Ireland).  The  claimant  accepts  that  he  failed  on  two
    occasions to notify the requisite authorities of his whereabouts.

7.   It is clear that the claimant has never  acquired  permanent  residence
    in the UK, having only resided here  for  3  months  prior  to  the  IO
    decision refusing him admission. That means that in assessing his  case
    under the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2006,  his
    exclusion from the UK could only be  justified  on  grounds  of  public
    policy, public security or public health. Put another way, he was  only
    entitled to the baseline level of protection, not the higher levels  of
    protection against exclusion or removal available  to  those  who  have
    acquired permanent residence or been her for  10  years  or  more.  All
    decisions taken on public policy, public  security  and  public  health
    grounds must comply with the requirements set  out  at  regulation  21.
    These include that the decision  must  comply  with  the  principle  of
    proportionality((5)(a)) and must be based exclusively on  the  personal
    conduct of the person concerned (5(b)) and the personal conduct of  the
    person concerned must represent a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
    serious threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests  of  society
    ((5)(c)).

8.   Before proceeding to re-make my decision, it is necessary  to  consider
    the further evidence submitted  by  the  claimant  in  response  to  my
    Directions. I am not  impressed  by  the  quality  of  the  'Letter  of
    Clarification' submitted by the Forensic Psychological  Services.  This
    is not simply because it is not a report but a report of  reports.  Nor
    is it simply that it  does  not  demonstrate  a  clear  methodology  in
    relation to assessment of the risk of re-offending in  the  context  of
    the range of factors such as are provided in the UK under the  auspices
    of Multi-agency protection arrangements (MAPPA)  reports.  It  is  also
    because of what it fails to address. It does not  for  instance  record
    when the claimant was interviewed or what questions were asked  of  him
    or what replies he gave. It does not address the extent to which it was
    considered the claimant had rehabilitated or  what  the  claimant  said
    that persuaded them the risk was moderate-low and whether in particular
    that was based on an objective assessment rather than merely reliant on
    the claimant's say so. The reference to  actuarial  assessment  is  not
    enough to establish that this was, as claimed, "objective".  I  do  not
    find it helpful that the  only  material  observation  made  about  the
    claimant's failure to register his address was that this was "likely to
    be due to poor problem-solving skills rather  than  dishonesty  on  his
    part". That may or may not be true, but it is impossible to glean  from
    this report on what basis this evaluation was arrived at. How long  the
    claimant  was  interviewed  for,  what  documents   were   before   the
    psychologist concerned, is not  stated.  Further,  in  support  of  the
    conclusion that the claimant's risk of future sexual offending  was  in
    2015 reassessed as being in the 'low risk range; "contributing factors"
    are said to include 'his general social withdrawal and rejection',  his
    negative emotionality and the  age  and  gender  of  his  victim.  Such
    factors on their face are equally capable of being factors pointing  to
    a high risk. I accept that because the claimant  was  well  beyond  his
    prescribed period of probation it may not have been possible to  obtain
    a report from  government  services,  but  that  does  not  redeem  the
    failings of this letter.  In short, I do not consider I can attach  any
    significant weight to this letter.

9.   Taking all relevant considerations into account, I  conclude  that  the
    decision of the IO to exclude the claimant was  and  remains  justified
    grounds of public,  policy  or  public  security.  My  reasons  are  as
    follows.

10.  In favour of the claimant is the  fact  that  the   the  public  policy
    exception constitutes a derogation from the right of residence of Union
    citizens/EEA  nationals  and  their  family  members,  which  must   be
    interpreted strictly and  the  scope  of  which  cannot  be  determined
    unilaterally by the Member States (see, to that effect Rend�n Mar�n, C-
    165/14, EU:C:2016:675, paragraph 58).  Further, the claimant's offences
    all took place as long ago  as  2003.   A  person's  previous  criminal
    convictions do not in  themselves  justify  a  public  policy  decision
    (regulation 21(5)(e)). Whilst I attach very little weight  to  it  (for
    reasons given above), I note  that  a  Forensic  Psychological  Service
    operating in Ireland has assessed  him  as  presently  a  low  risk  of
    reoffending.

11.  However, I consider the factors counting in favour of the  claimant  to
    be considerably outweighed by those counting against  him.  First,  the
    offence is indubitably a serious one, as  reflected  not  only  in  the
    length of sentence (four and three years to  be  served  consecutively,
    along with an additional sentence of four years bound  over  for  seven
    years). Second the nature of the offence is a particularly serious one.
    As the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) has confirmed in a  number  of
    cases, most recently in E (Citizenship of the Union - Right to move and
    reside freely in the territory of the Member States:  Judgment)  [2017]
    EUECJ C-193/16 (13 July 2017)  in  paragraph  20  of  which  the  Court
    stated:

            "In that regard, it must be  noted  that,  in  accordance  with
         Article 83(1) TFEU, the sexual exploitation of children is one  of
         the  areas  of  particularly  serious  crime  with  a  cross-border
         dimension in which the European Union  legislature  may  intervene.
         Therefore, it is open to  the  Member  States  to  regard  criminal
         offences such as those referred to in the  second  subparagraph  of
         Article 83(1) TFEU as constituting a particularly serious threat to
         one of the fundamental interests of society,  which  might  pose  a
         direct threat to the calm and physical security of  the  population
         ..."


12.  The Court in the E case was concerned with whether such  offences  were
    capable of being covered by  the  concept  of  'imperative  grounds  of
    public security' (governing the highest  level  of  protection  against
    exclusion), but its reasoning applies a fortiori to the mere  issue  of
    whether such offences are capable of being  covered  by  public  policy
    grounds in view of their seriousness.

13.  Third, although the offences had been committed as long  ago  in  2003,
    the claimant had recently breached the requirement to notify the  Garda
    of his change of address for the purposes of the national sex offenders
    register in Ireland on two occasions and one (if not both) of these was
    in the trans-border context of movement to the UK. The claimant himself
    has sought to explain this by saying "I found it very difficult  to  do
    so". The "Letter of Clarification" from the Forensic  Psychologist  put
    this failure down to "poor  problem-solving  skills".  I  do  not  find
    either of these explanations satisfactory. The claimant must have known
    that he was under an obligation to report his address and that this was
    critical to being able to  show  he  was  no  longer  a  real  risk  of
    reoffending.  Such failure indicates in my judgement that the  claimant
    continued - and  continues  -  to  represent  a  genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat to the fundamental interests of society.

14.  Fourth, there is scant evidence to suggest that the  claimant  has  had
    had any meaningful length of  residence  in  the  UK  or  that  he  has
    socially and culturally integrated into British society.

15.  For the above reasons I conclude  that  the  claimant's  exclusion  was
    justified on public policy, public security and public  health  grounds
    and remains so. It was not a disproportionate measure on the  basis  of
    the given evidence.

16.  To summarise:

     I have already found that the FtT judge materially erred in law.

     The decision I re-make is to dismiss the claimant's appeal.
