                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. These are the appeals of Salamat [A] and  her  son  [KA],  citizens  of
    Nigeria born respectively [~] 1983 and [~] 2009, against  the  decision
    of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Davey)  of  20  September   2018
    dismissing their appeals, themselves brought against the refusals on  4
    October 2017 of their human rights claims.

Introduction

 2. The immigration history supplied by the Secretary of State sets out  Ms
    [A]'s claim to have entered the UK on 10 January 2009. Applications for
    leave on private and  family  life  grounds  had  been  made  on  three
    occasions, during July 2015, October 2015 and May 2016,  but  each  had
    been  rejected,  for  failures  to  pay  the  application  fee  or  the
    Immigration Health Surcharge.

 3. Ms [A] gave a history of her past experiences leading  to  her  present
    situation. For present purposes I summarise the facts as they appear in
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal. She entered the UK on a  visit
    visa obtained with a false passport in the name of [AO]. She  had  been
    brought to the UK by someone she believed to have been a Good Samaritan
    but  who  subsequently  sought  to  exploit  her,  by  prostitution  or
    otherwise, though she escaped that  possibility.  She  entered  into  a
    relationship with a man (who fathered [KA]), though that ended  quickly
    thereafter and [KA] had never known him.

 4. Ms [A]'s claim was essentially that a return to Nigeria would leave her
    and  [KA]  living  in  very   straitened   circumstances   leading   to
    destitution, poverty and ill treatment; she relied on medical  evidence
    stating that she had ongoing  problems  with  depression.  She  had  no
    relatives in the UK but did have  strong  friendships.  A  social  work
    report from Dr Farooqi set out [KA]'s speech and learning difficulties,
    which had been addressed via various measures.  Ms [A] feared that [KA]
    would be disadvantaged in his development as, though he might  well  be
    taught in English in Nigeria, nevertheless his peers would speak Yoruba
    around him.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 5. In the light of concerns  raised  by  the  evidence  that  Ms  [A]  was
    vulnerable, it was considered appropriate for some regard to be had  to
    the Vulnerable Witness Practice Direction, offering the possibility  of
    appropriate breaks in proceedings,  though  this  opportunity  was  not
    taken up.

 6. The First-tier Tribunal rejected Ms [A]'s claim to have been brought to
    Nigeria via another person's agency, on the basis that  had  she  truly
    been exploited in that way, she would  have  brought  a  protection  or
    similar claim much sooner. Her claims  to  face  impoverishment  abroad
    were not accepted as she had made no enquiries as to the  possibilities
    regarding employment; her fears represented un-evidenced assertions. It
    did not accept that the medical evidence  indicated  any  inability  to
    obtain the necessary psychiatric help, given the evidence  referred  to
    claims of depression associated with [KA]'s birth a long time ago;  her
    anxieties largely flowed from her own immigration status, for which she
    was herself responsible. The mere fact economic circumstances were poor
    in Nigeria did not oblige the UK to provide nationals of  that  country
    with the opportunity of a home here; there was no  country  information
    indicating that mature women could not find employment.

 7. No blame could be laid at [KA]'s door for his mother's actions. She had
    deliberately sought to obtain and pursue the benefits of life in the UK
    for both him and her. He was in school in  the  UK,  and  had  received
    special educational support at various times. Thus his  best  interests
    were in favour of remaining  in  the  UK.  Nevertheless,  the  evidence
    indicated that the courses and support that had been arranged  for  him
    had ended in 2017; his current class teacher's referred to  his  having
    made progress overall.

 8. [KA] had no entitlement to an  education  in  the  UK  and  the  social
    worker's report essentially stated the "rather obvious consequences  of
    a life and development that has been achieved in the  United  Kingdom."
    There was nothing to suggest he would be removed if his mother was  not
    removed. The concerns that he  would  be  disadvantaged  by  his  peers
    speaking Yoruba was met by the fact that children often  had  to  begin
    again  in  new  locations,  circumstances   and   languages   following
    international moves. The claim  that  [KA]  had  lost  touch  with  his
    African roots was doubted, but even if partly true, his mother was well-
    placed to introduce him to Nigerian society. The Judge referred to  the
    need to find strong or powerful reasons to justify a qualifying child's
    departure, having regard to decisions such as  Hesham  Ali�Agyarko,  MA
    (Pakistan) and MA (Pakistan). The Judge also noted the possibility that
    Ms [A] would enjoy some degree of support from the friends in the UK in
    getting herself re-established in Nigeria,  albeit  expecting  them  to
    provide her with ongoing financial support was "a far reach."

 9. Summing up his thinking, the Judge concluded that [KA]'s best interests
    were clearly in favour of his  remaining  in  the  UK,  but  given  his
    mother's unsubstantiated fears as to  the  consequences  of  return  to
    Nigeria, it was reasonable to expect him to depart with her.

10. There were no very  significant  obstacles  to  [KA]'s  integration  in
    Nigeria,  given  he  could  speak  English   and   had   overcome   the
    developmental problems he previously faced, and there being no evidence
    that he could not seek and obtain appropriate assistance in Nigeria.

11. The First-tier Tribunal concluded �18, "whilst the best  interests,  on
    their own, of the Second Appellant  lie  in  remaining  in  the  United
    Kingdom, his best interests truly lie in remaining within the  care  of
    his mother and returning to Nigeria with her".

12. Grounds of appeal contended that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  materially
    erred in law in

      a) Applying the "very significant obstacles to integration" test to an
         8-year  old  child  which  was  incompatible   with   a   test   of
         reasonableness;

      b) Notwithstanding having thrice found [KA]'s best interests to  point
         in favour  of  remaining  in  the  UK,  having  proceeded  to  make
         contradictory   findings   (�18   cited   above)    where    [KA]'s
         individualised best interests were  said  to  point  in  favour  of
         remaining in the UK whilst his true best interests called  for  his
         departure with his mother;

      c) Failing to take account of the evidence from Ms  [A]'s  GP  stating
         that since August 2017 she had regularly presented with  depression
         which had been treated both medicinally and with psychotherapy. The
         country evidence pointed to the lack  of  capacity  of  the  mental
         health service in Nigeria, which was documented as being "unable to
         respond to overwhelming needs  of  those  suffering  mental  health
         issues" and in consequence placed an immense  financial  burden  on
         those so affected. This was  therefore  a  material  error  in  the
         decision,  given  any  diminution  in  her  mental   health   would
         necessarily impact on her ability to care for [KA];

      d) Inadequate reasons had been given for  the  conclusion  that  there
         were powerful reasons calling  for  [KA]'s  best  interests  to  be
         compromised by leaving the UK; such reasons as were given  amounted
         to blaming him for his mother's immigration history, contrary to ZH
         (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4, and also in conflict with  the  benchmark
         indicated by the Upper Tribunal in MT and ET.

13. Permission to appeal was granted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  27
    December 2018 on the basis that all grounds were arguable.

14. Mr Walker for the Respondent accepted that the decision was  inadequate
    due to the confusing findings as to [KA]'s best interests.  He observed
    that there had also been rather a long gap between the hearing and  the
    writing of the decision. Ms Mellon therefore did not  need  to  develop
    the grounds of appeal.



Findings and reasons

15. For the reasons set out in the  grounds  of  appeal,  and  particularly
    given the confusion epitomised by �18, I  consider  that  the  decision
    cannot stand.

16. Given the confusion that has afflicted the appeal so far, it is helpful
    to remind oneself of the relevant legal context. Under the  Immigration
    Rules:

         "Requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to remain on  the
         grounds of private life

         276ADE (1). The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to
         remain on the grounds of private life in the UK  are  that  at  the
         date of application, the applicant: (i) does not fall  for  refusal
         under any of the grounds in Section S-LTR 1.1 to S-LTR 2.2. and  S-
         LTR.3.1. to S-LTR.4.5. in Appendix FM; and

             ...

             (iv)       is  under  the  age  of  18  years  and  has  lived
             continuously in the UK for at least 7 years  (discounting  any
             period of imprisonment) and it  would  not  be  reasonable  to
             expect the applicant to leave the UK; or

             ...

             (vi)       ...  is  aged  18  years  or   above,   has   lived
             continuously in the UK for less than 20 years (discounting any
             period of imprisonment) but there would  be  very  significant
             obstacles to the applicant's integration into the  country  to
             which he would have to go if required to leave the UK."

17. Section 117B(6) of NIAA 2002 states:

         "117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable  in  all
         cases

         ...

         (6)      In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation,
         the public interest does not require the person's removal where-

             (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave
             the United Kingdom."

18. Thus, both inside and outside the Rules, the existence of a  seven-year
    resident child within an application significantly changes the test  to
    be applied. There is no material difference here in the approach within
    and outside the Rules, given that [KA] had been resident in the UK  for
    seven years by the application date (being born in October 2009 and the
    application being made in March 2017).

19. In  Azimi-Moayed  and  others  (decisions  affecting  children;  onward
    appeals) Iran [2013] UKUT 197 (IAC) the President's  Tribunal  set  out
    that:

         "ii)     It is generally in the interests of children to have  both
         stability and continuity of social and  educational  provision  and
         the benefit of growing up in the cultural norms of the  society  to
         which they belong.

         iii)     Lengthy residence in a country other  than  the  state  of
         origin can lead to development of social cultural  and  educational
         ties that it would be inappropriate to disrupt, in the  absence  of
         compelling  reason  to  the  contrary.  What  amounts  to   lengthy
         residence is not clear cut  but  past  and  present  policies  have
         identified seven years as a relevant period.

         iv)      Apart from the terms of published policies and rules,  the
         Tribunal notes that seven years from age four is likely to be  more
         significant to a child that the first seven  years  of  life.  Very
         young children are focussed on  their  parents  rather  than  their
         peers and are adaptable."

20. The Secretary of State has published a  policy  document,  Every  Child
    Matters - Change for Children, as statutory guidance to the  UK  Border
    Agency on making arrangements to safeguard and promote the  welfare  of
    children, which refers to the definition of this task found in  section
    11 of the Children Act 2004 and in the policy guidance Working Together
    to Safeguard Children, as "ensuring that children  are  growing  up  in
    circumstances consistent with the provision of safe and effective care;
    and undertaking that role so  as  to  enable  those  children  to  have
    optimum life chances and to enter adulthood successfully."

21. As stated by Elias LJ in MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ  705  �49,  Ex.1
    "establishes as a starting point that leave should  be  granted  unless
    there are powerful reasons to the contrary"; albeit that �73:  "It  may
    be reasonable to require the child to leave where there are good cogent
    reasons, even if they are not compelling."

22. In MT and ET Nigeria [2018] UKUT 88 (IAC) the Upper  Tribunal  examined
    the "best interests" question in  a  seven-year  resident  child  case,
    where a mother and daughter had lived in the UK  for  around  a  decade
    (for the latter, from the age of four to fourteen) by the time  of  the
    appeal hearing. The First-tier Tribunal had found that the daughter had
    no memory of Nigeria and was well integrated in school and socially; it
    was clearly in her best interests to remain in  the  UK.  However,  her
    mother had overstayed her original visit visa, pursued a  false  asylum
    claim and received a community order for  using  a  false  document  to
    obtain employment. The Judge concluded that the child's uprooting  from
    school and loss of her friends would be  no  different  to  the  common
    experience of any child whose parents decided  to  make  a  significant
    move abroad or otherwise.

23. The Upper Tribunal found a material error of law in the approach below,
    and upon re-determining  the  appeal,  disagreed  with  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's assessment. It relied on MA  Pakistan  for  the  proposition
    that seven years' residence in the UK "establishes as a starting  point
    that leave should be granted unless there are powerful reasons  to  the
    contrary". The mother was (as the UT expressed it)  merely  a  somewhat
    "run of the mill" immigration offender who came to the  United  Kingdom
    on a visit visa, overstayed, made a claim for asylum that was found  to
    be false and subsequently pursued various legal means of  remaining  in
    the  United  Kingdom.  The  Tribunal  concluded  that  these  were  not
    sufficiently powerful reasons to counteract the child's best  interests
    when assessing reasonableness: the appeal was accordingly allowed.

24. There has been a recent re-statement of  the  law  regarding  the  best
    interests of the children: KO (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53 �32.

      a) "in  the  absence  of  clear  language  to  the  contrary  ...  the
         provisions  are  intended  to  be  consistent  with   the   general
         principles relating to the "best interests" of children,  including
         the principle that "a child must not  be  blamed  for  matters  for
         which he or she is not  responsible,  such  as  the  conduct  of  a
         parent" �15;

      b) "it seems to me inevitably relevant in both  contexts  to  consider
         where the parents, apart from the relevant provision, are  expected
         to be, since it will normally be reasonable for  the  child  to  be
         with them. To that extent the record  of  the  parents  may  become
         indirectly material, if it leads to their ceasing to have  a  right
         to remain here, and having to leave" �18;

      c)  "the issue of "reasonableness" under section 117B(6)  is  focussed
         on the position of the child" �32.

25. The upshot of the authorities above is that

      a) Where there is an evidence-backed case  going  to  the  connections
         that a qualifying child has with the UK, the Tribunal  must  engage
         in detail with their best interests and weigh the reasonableness of
         relocation with care;

      b) Where a child's best interests point in favour of them remaining in
         the UK, powerful reasons need to be identified before the interests
         of immigration control will trump those considerations;

      c) In a two-parent case, where neither parent has an enduring right to
         remain in  the  UK  (leaving  aside  the  direction  in  which  the
         qualifying' child's best interests would point),  then  that  forms
         part of the assessment,  which  must  be  conducted  in  the  "real
         world": it can accordingly be seen that "real world" considerations
         may  constitute  powerful  reasons  sufficient  to  counteract  the
         child's best interests of the kind identified in MA (Pakistan);

      d) Ultimately cases will turn on  the  considerations  such  as  those
         identified in Azimi-Moayed and  in  the  statutory  guidance  Every
         Child Matters.

26. Strictly speaking the authorities hold that it is not essential to make
    findings  on  a  child's  best  interests  prior   to   assessing   the
    reasonableness  of  their  relocation  abroad,  though  it  would  seem
    significantly more logical to take best interests first. In any  event,
    it is vital for a clear finding to be made as to "best interests".

27. But the "real world" assessment is likely to be rather more complicated
    in a single-parent case, particularly where there is a real possibility
    that the sole primary carer has mental health issues that might  impede
    their ability to make social connections abroad  which  might  in  turn
    impact on their ability to care for their child.

28. Now to take the grounds of appeal within the legal framework identified
    above.

      a) Clearly the First-tier Tribunal was rather confused in the approach
         it  took  to  the  limbs  of  Rule  276ADE(vi):  it  can  never  be
         appropriate to assess a seven-year resident child's application  by
         reference to the "very significant obstacles to integration"  test,
         as  that  is  plainly  posits  a   much   higher   threshold   than
         "reasonableness": that error would not, though, be material, if the
         reasoning on "reasonableness" was severable  from  that  addressing
         276ADE(vi);

      b) In fact however, the reasoning on "reasonableness" is confused: the
         First-tier Tribunal made unclear and contradictory findings  as  to
         where [KA]'s best interests actually lay;

      c) It also overlooked the evidence indicating that the First Appellant
         has current rather than simply historic depression;

      d) Many, if not all, of the matters taken as outweighing  [KA]'s  best
         interests appear to be directly attributable to matters  for  which
         his mother is solely responsible, contrary both  to  ZH  (Tanzania)
         and KO (Nigeria).

29. As these findings go to the very core of the appeal, it is  accordingly
    necessary for the matter to be reheard afresh. As full findings of fact
    will have to be made when the appeal is next  determined,  remittal  to
    the First-tier Tribunal is appropriate. It is  to  be  hoped  that  the
    legal framework above  will  assist  in  the  appeal's  subsequent  re-
    determination.

    Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error  of
    law.

    The appeal is allowed to the  extent  it  is  remitted  for  re-hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal.
