Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R Singer, Counsel instructed by Hamlet
Solicitors, London


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Mrs Lubna Begum and her son Mr Musayel Ahmed are citizens of Bangladesh
    whose dates of birth are recorded respectively as 10 February 1990  and
    19 August 2010.  On or about 3 April 2013 they  applied  for  leave  to
    enter the United Kingdom with a view to settlement as  the  Spouse  and
    child respectively of Shamim  Ahmed,  a  British  citizen  present  and
    settled in the United Kingdom.  On 4 July 2013 decisions were  made  to
    refuse the applications and so by notices of appeal dated 7 August 2013
    they appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  On 9  September  2014  their
    appeals were heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Chamberlain, who
    in a determination promulgated on  17  September  2014,  dismissed  the
    appeals under the Immigration Rules but allowed the  appeals  on  human
    rights grounds (Article 8).

 2. There was no dispute before Judge Chamberlain that the appeal could not
    succeed under the Immigration Rules as the Sponsor was paid in cash  he
    was required to provide specified evidence as required by Appendix  FM-
    SE, which he was unable to do.

 3. In refusing the application the  Secretary  of  State  pointed  to  the
    Immigration Rules which required  a  gross  income  of  not  less  than
    �22,400 per annum given that there was to be taken  into  consideration
    Musayel Ahmed.  Quite separate from the failure of the then  Applicants
    to provide the specified evidence,  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  who
    determined the application was not satisfied that the Sponsor's  income
    was as claimed and took various points in respect of such  evidence  as
    was produced, casting doubt on the voracity of the documentation though
    without going so far as alleging fraud.  Further it was said that Lubna
    Begum  had  not  met  the  English  language  requirement   since   the
    documentation submitted was not reliable.

 4. Judge Chamberlain looked to the available evidence and  found  that  it
    was established, on balance of  probabilities,  that  the  Sponsor  was
    earning in excess of the amount required by the Secretary of  State  to
    sponsor entry clearance for a Spouse and dependant child.   As  to  the
    English language requirement, the Judge found insufficient evidence  in
    support  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's   contention   that   the
    documentation supplied was unreliable but found in the light of all the
    evidence that it was proved by  the  Appellant  to  be  reliable,  and,
    having regard to the totality of the evidence, found the  documentation
    reliable so that the English language  requirements  were  met  by  Mrs
    Lubna Begum.

 5. What Judge  Chamberlain  then  did  was  to  examine  the  family  life
    contended for between the Sponsor and Mrs Lubna Begum  and  Mr  Musayel
    Ahmed.  Judge Chamberlain  found  the  consequence  of  refusal  to  be
    interference in the family life  and  then  following  the  five  stage
    approach in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27, found the  decisions  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer to be disproportionate.  In coming to that  view  the
    Judge had regard to Section 117B of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 and found that the only reason that the application did
    not succeed was because the Sponsor was being paid in cash; not because
    the substantive requirements were not met in relation to finance.

 6. Judge Chamberlain, guided further by the dicta in Patel v  SSHD  [2013]
    UKSC 72, found that the Article 8 claim had merit, taking into account,
    in particular, the fact that this was a family consisting of a  mother,
    father and 4 year old child.  To refuse permission because the  Sponsor
    was paid in cash rather than because he was unable to support his  wife
    and child did not meet, in the judge's view, the  proportionality  test
    and further, quite properly, the Judge had regard to the best interests
    of that 4 year old child which was, in the Judge's  view,  to  be  with
    both parents with the family being together.  Indeed the Judge came  to
    the view that the Sponsor had been working to ensure that he  would  be
    able to provide financially for his wife and child.  The Judge went  on
    to consider whether it was reasonable to expect the Sponsor to relocate
    to Bangladesh but found that it was not;  the  Sponsor  was  a  British
    citizen who was employed in the United Kingdom with an extended  family
    in the United Kingdom.

 7. Not content with the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal,  by  Notice
    dated 25 September 2014, the Secretary of State  made  application  for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  The  grounds  submit  that
    only if there were arguably good grounds for granting leave  to  remain
    outside the Immigration Rules was it necessary for the Judge to proceed
    to  consider  whether   there   were   compelling   circumstances   not
    sufficiently  recognised  under  them.   Reliance  was  placed  on  the
    guidance in R (On the application of Nagre) v Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department [2013] EW HC 720 (Admin).  It  was  submitted  that
    there  were  no  compelling  circumstances  identified  by  the   judge
    sufficient to embark upon the course taken.

 8. Further, relying on the dicta in Miah and others v Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 261, and in particular  to  the
    judgment of Burnton LJ, it was submitted that the degree of  compliance
    on the part of the Sponsor with the provisions of the Immigration Rules
    did not amount to something that needed to  be  "factored  in"  by  the
    Tribunal or Secretary of State to the  proportionality  exercise  under
    Article 8.  The Secretary of State submits that essentially  the  judge
    allowed the appeal on the basis  of  "near  miss"  when  such  was  not
    permissible; either the Immigration Rules were met or not.

 9. On 4 November 2014 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal P J C White granted
    permission thus the matter comes before me.

Was there an error of Law?

10. For the Secretary of State, Mr Avery submits that there was  no  proper
    basis for the Judge to depart from the Immigration Rules and that there
    is no authority to suggest  that  Appendix  FM-SE  was  not  Article  8
    compliant.  The judge was not entitled to use Article 8  as  a  general
    dispensing power.  I agree with the submission that the Judge  was  not
    entitled to use Article 8 as a general dispensing power;  the  question
    in this case is whether that is what the judge did.

11. Mr Singer for the Respondents produced a lengthy and  helpful  Rule  24
    response.  Reference is made to numerous authorities.

12. There has been considerable consideration by the Upper Tribunal and the
    higher Courts with respect to the extent to which it is  proper  for  a
    judge  to  look  to  the  wider  application  of  Article  8  when  the
    Immigration Rules are not  met.   I  do  not  propose  to  add  to  the
    considerable number of authorities which have attempted to set out,  in
    the clearest possible terms, guidance in this regard.  The  three  more
    recent authorities however, which assist me, in the date order in which
    they were heard, are: R (On the application of Esther Ebun Oludoyi  and
    ors) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  (Article  8  -  MM
    (Lebanon) and Nagre) IJR [2014] UK UT 000589 (IAC); Sultana and  others
    (Rules: Waiver/Further enquiry; discretion) [2014]  UK  UT00540  (IAC);
    and R (On the application of  Halimatu  SA  Adiya  Damilola  Aliyu  and
    Fatima Oluwakemi Aliyu) [2014] EWHC 3919(Admin).

13. In the case of Oludoyi Upper Tribunal Judge Gill found that:-

         "There is nothing in R (Nagre) v  SSHD  [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin),
         Gulshan (Article 8 - new rules - correct approach) Pakistan  [2013]
         UK UT640 (IAC) or Shahzad (Article 8:  Legitimate  aim)  [2014]  UK
         UT00085 (IAC)  that  suggests  that  a  threshold  test  was  being
         suggested as opposed to making it clear that there was  a  need  to
         look at the evidence to see if there was  anything  which  has  not
         already  been  adequately  considered  in  the   context   of   the
         Immigration Rules and which could lead to a  successful  Article  8
         claim.  These authorities must not be read as seeking to qualify or
         fetter the assessment of Article 8.  This is consistent  with  para
         128 of R (MM and others) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985, that there  is
         no utility in imposing a further intermediate test as a preliminary
         to a consideration of  an  Article  8  claim  beyond  the  relevant
         criterion-based rule.  As is held in R (Ganesabalam) v SSHD  [2014]
         EW HC2712 (Admin), there  is  no  prior  threshold  which  dictates
         whether the exercise of discretion should be considered; rather the
         nature of the assessment and the reasoning which are called for are
         informed by threshold considerations."

14. In the case of Sultana, the President of the  Upper  Tribunal,  sitting
    together with Upper Tribunal Judge Dawson held as follows:-

         "(1) [D] of Appendix FM-SE is an example, within the context of the
             requirement to supply specified evidence,  of  the  increasing
             influence  of  discretionary  powers  of  waiver  and  further
             enquiry in the Immigration Rules.

         (2)  Where applicants wish to invoke any discretion of  this  kind,
             they should  do  so  when  making  the  relevant  application,
             highlighting the specific provisions of the rules invoked  and
             the  grounds  upon  which  the  exercise  of   discretion   is
             requested.

         (3)  Where any request of this kind is made and  refused,  a  brief
             explanation should be provided by the decision maker.

         (4)  Where a refusal to exercise a discretionary power as described
             in (1)  above  may  render  an  immigration  decision  not  in
             accordance  with  the  law,  under  Section  84(1)(e)  of  the
             Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

         (5)  Powers of waiver are dispensing provisions, designed to ensure
             that applications suffering  from  certain  minor  defects  or
             omissions can be readily remedied.

         (6)  The hierarchical distinction between the Immigration Rules and
             Immigration  Directorate  instructions   ("IDI's")   must   be
             observed at all times.

         (7)  Failure to recognise, or give effect to, an IDI may render  an
             immigration decision not in accordance with the law."

15. Turning then finally to the case of Aliyu, Judge  Grubb  sitting  as  a
    Deputy High Court Judge said as follows:-

         "59. In my judgment, the Secretary of State (apart  from  "Complete
             Code" situations) always  has  a  discretion  to  grant  leave
             outside the rules.  That discretion must be exercised  on  the
             basis of Article 8 considerations, in particular assessing all
             relevant  factors  in  determining  whether  a   decision   is
             proportionate under Article 8.2.  There is, in  principle,  no
             "Threshold" criterion of "Arguability."  I respectfully  agree
             with what Aikens LJ said in this  regard  in  MM  (at  [128]).
             However that factor, taken together with other facts  such  as
             the extent to which the  rules  have  taken  into  account  an
             individuals  circumstances  relevant  to   Article   8,   will
             condition the nature and extent of the consideration  required
             as a matter of law by the Secretary of State of an individuals
             claim under Article 8 outside  the  rules.   If  there  is  no
             arguable case, it will suffice  for  the  Secretary  of  State
             simply briefly to say so  giving  adequate  reasons  for  that
             conclusion.  At the other extreme, where  there  are  arguable
             good grounds that the rules do not  adequately  deal  with  an
             individuals circumstances relevant in assessing Article 8, the
             Secretary of  State  must  consider  those  circumstances  and
             identifiably carry out  the  balancing  exercise  required  by
             proportionality in determining whether there are  "Exceptional
             circumstances" requiring the grant of leave outside the  rules
             under Article 8.

         60.  In any event, as is made plain in Ganesabalan,  a  failure  to
             consider whether to  exercise  discretion  outside  the  rules
             will, in itself, by unlawful.

         61.  That said, a failure to consider the exercise of discretion or
             failing properly to consider the relevant factors outside  the
             rules, though unlawful, will not result in the court  granting
             any relief if the decision would "Inevitably"  have  been  the
             same (see Ganesabalan at [37] and Haleemudeen at [61]".

16. In making his submissions  Mr  Singer  submitted  that  Appendix  FM-SE
    (Family Members - Specified Evidence at D) provided  a  discretion  and
    that since there was that discretion it could  not  be  said  that  the
    rules were a complete code.

17. Under the heading "Evidence of Financial  Requirements  under  Appendix
    FM" at (1)(m) it is provided that:

          "Cash income on which the correct tax has been paid may be counted
          as income under this appendix, subject to the relevant  evidential
          requirements of this appendix."

18. That must be read together with (k) which provides:

          "Where the gross (Pre tax) amount of any income cannot be properly
          evidenced, the net (Post tax) amount will  be  counted,  including
          towards a gross income requirement."

19. There then follows at (2) the evidential  requirements  in  respect  of
    salaried employment.  I need not rehearse those requirements because it
    is not in issue that they were not met.

20. The case advanced in the First-tier Tribunal and accepted by the  Judge
    was that the Sponsor was indeed paid in cash.

21. Turning to the grounds themselves, I remind myself that the authorities
    to which I have referred were each judicial  review  cases  so  that  a
    rather different test to that to which I have to have regard was  under
    consideration. However, the  guidance  is  clear,  namely  that  having
    regard to the totality of the evidence, it is open to a judge  to  look
    to the wider application of Article 8 if he or she concludes that there
    would be a disproportionate result, having regard to the legitimate aim
    being pursued by the Secretary of State.

22. The grounds as drafted submit that  only  where  there  are  compelling
    circumstances, not sufficiently recognised under the Immigration Rules,
    can a judge depart from the Immigration Rules.  It is  clear  from  the
    more recent authorities that that submission is not one that has  found
    support and I see no reason not to follow the learning in the  guidance
    to which I have referred. Each  of  those  authorities  has  themselves
    considered the multiplicity of authorities dealing with  the  point.  I
    agree with them.

23. As to the second ground, I do not find that the judge did approach this
    appeal as if it were "a near miss."  The judge found that  all  of  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules had been met save for the form of
    the  evidence.   This  was  not  a  case,  for  example,  there  was  a
    requirement that there should be income of �22,400 but  that  say  only
    �22,000 were available; the judge found as a fact that  the  income  of
    the Sponsor exceeded the minimum requirement  though  it  is  right  to
    observe that in allowing the appeal  under  Article  8  the  judge  did
    dispense with the requirement at FM-SE 1(k), being a  point  which  was
    taken by the Entry Clearance Manager on review.

24. That, however, is not the end of the matter.  The "near miss" principle
    was considered at length by the Supreme Court in the case  of  Patel  v
    SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 742.

          "55.    Thus the balance drawn by the rules must  be  relevant  to
          the consideration of proportionality.  I said  as  much  in  Rudi.
          Although I rejected the concept of a "Near miss principle," I  did
          not see this as inconsistent with Collins J's words in Lekstaka:

              'Collins J's statement, on which the court relied in SB, seems
             unobjectionable.  It is saying no more, as I read it, than the
             practical or compassionate considerations which  underlie  the
             policy are also likely to be relevant to the case of those who
             fall just outside it, and to that extent  may  add  weight  to
             their argument for exceptional treatment.  He  is  not  saying
             that there arises any  presumption  or  expectation  that  the
             policy will be extended to embrace them." (Paragraph 31(ii)).'

          (My reference to "Exceptional treatment" needs to be read  now  in
          the light of Huang Paragraph 20 in which Lord Bingham  made  clear
          that, contrary to previous Court of Appeal case law, there was  no
          separate "Test for Exceptionality."

25. In my judgment what the Judge did in this case was open  to  her.   The
    appeal before  me  concentrated  only  on  the  financial  requirements
    provisions.  The English language point was not challenged.  I  observe
    that in the refusal,  and  indeed  in  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager's
    further considerations, what  appears  really  to  have  concerned  the
    Secretary of State was the adequacy of  the  evidence.   That  evidence
    however has had the benefit of some considerable scrutiny by the  Judge
    who made findings that were open to her namely that despite  Rule  (k),
    on proper examination, the mischief of the substantive rule that  there
    should be sufficient monies available for the family to  be  maintained
    without recourse to public funds was met.  In that sense this was not a
    near miss case at all but rather a total miss in the sense that certain
    evidential requirement was not met.   The  Judge  then  looked  at  the
    totality of the evidence and asked herself whether  the  Appellants  in
    the First-tier Tribunal should be denied entry when the  real  mischief
    which lay behind the rules had  been  met  namely  that  which  I  have
    already said, the ability to maintain themselves.

26. Whilst the Immigration Rules have been drafted with Article 8 in  mind,
    the rules and Article 8  are  not  an  identical  regime.   The  family
    members in this case asserted their right to family life and that right
    can only be interfered with, if, having regard to  the  legitimate  aim
    (which in this case was the economic wellbeing of the  United  Kingdom)
    it was proportionate to deny entry.

27. Ultimately this case is  about  whether  the  Secretary  of  State  has
    justified the interference in the right of the nuclear family including
    a 4 year old child to be together.  In my judgment because was open  to
    the Judge to look to proportionality within the  wider  application  of
    article 8 ECHR means that the Secretary of State  has  failed  to  show
    that this is a decision that cannot stand.  I remind  myself  that  the
    findings of fact are not  challenged.   The  Judge  looked  to  various
    factors including the best interests of the 4 year old child. It is not
    in dispute that the Sponsor had the requisite earnings: the grounds are
    silent on the point. The Secretary of State might have argued, but  did
    not, that because of the rules it was only open to the  Judge  to  find
    that a figure net of tax had been proved. I say no more, the point  was
    not taken in the grounds,  nor  argued  before  me.   The  point  taken
    relates only to the failure to provide the  evidence  in  a  particular
    form. Whilst I accept that there may be other  judges  who  might  have
    taken a different view, that is not a matter with which I am concerned.
     I am concerned with whether the approach of this judge  was  one  that
    was open to her having regard to the guiding principles in the case  of
    R (Iran) [2005] EWCA Civ 982.

28. I find that the Secretary of State has not established  any  sufficient
    reason for me to interfere with the findings of the Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal or that there is any  material  error  of  law.   In  the
    circumstances the appeal is dismissed.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed. The Decisions of  the  First  tier  Tribunal  shall
