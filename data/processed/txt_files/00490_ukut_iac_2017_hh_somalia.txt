Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Ibrahim (sponsor)


   1) The scheme of sections 82 to 85 of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
      Asylum Act 2002 does not permit an appeal to be conditionally  allowed
      or dismissed.
   2) Even in entry clearance cases,  section  85(4)  allows  post  decision
      evidence provided it does not constitute a new matter.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, made on 7 March  2017,
    in which the First-tier Tribunal Judge gave as his decision that he was
    "minded to allow  the  appeal  either  under  paragraph  297  or  under
    paragraph 352D, family reunion with a person  granted  refugee  status,
    subject to compliance with my direction  relevant  to  that  provision,
    otherwise it is not allowed".  In paragraph 54  of  his  decision,  the
    judge reiterated that "I will to that extent allow the appeal under the
    Immigration Rules.  The respondent's decision  was  not  in  accordance
    with the law, subject to the provision of the evidence indicated".

 2.  We shall explain in due course why these pronouncements of  the  judge
    are seriously problematic.  First, we need to give some background.

 3. The appellant in the appeal is  a  young  lady  from  Somaliland  whose
    father, the sponsor,  is  a  British  citizen  by  naturalisation.   An
    application was made (probably in 2014 but certainly before  6th  April
    2015) by the appellant to be granted  entry  clearance  to  the  United
    Kingdom under paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules. This was to allow
    her to rejoin her father, the  United  Kingdom  sponsor.   The  sponsor
    works in the transportation industry in  London.   He  arrived  in  the
    United Kingdom in January 2001 and  was  granted  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in August 2005.  That followed a period of four  years'  limited
    leave to remain.  He became a British citizen on 2 February 2007.

 4. It is common ground that the  decision  refusing  the  appellant  entry
    clearance is to be treated as being made on 6 May 2015. It is therefore
    necessary to establish what  appellate  enactments  govern  the  appeal
    proceedings.

 5. Article 9 of the Immigration Act 2014 (Commencement No 3,  Transitional
    and Saving Provisions) Order 2014 (as inserted by SI 2015/371) provides
    as follows-

         "9 (1) Notwithstanding the commencement of the relevant  provisions
         [which include new sections 82 to 85 and amended section 86 of  the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002] the saved  provisions
         [which include sections 82 to 86, as they were  immediately  before
         commencement] continue to have effect and the  relevant  provisions
         do not have effect so far as they relate to the following decisions
         of the Secretary of State -

            ...

            (c) a decision made on or after 6th April 2015 ... to refuse an
            application made before 6th April 2015, where that decision  is
            -

              ...

              (ii) to refuse entry clearance;

            unless that decision is also a refusal of a  ...  human  rights
            claim."

 6.     The Secretary of State's Guidance indicates  that  a  human  rights
    claim for this purpose includes an application made under Part 8 of the
    Immigration Rules, where the sponsor is  present  and  settled  in  the
    United Kingdom. Part  8  is  entitled  "Family  members"  and  includes
    paragraph 297. We  see  no  reason  why  the  Tribunal  should  take  a
    different view.   Accordingly,  the  new  provisions  of  the  relevant
    legislation apply; that is to say,  the  new  sections  82  to  85  and
    amended 86 of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,  as
    substituted by the Immigration Act 2014.  As we  shall  see,  this  has
    relevance to the evidence that may be considered to  any  re-making  of
    the decision.

 7. The judge heard evidence from the sponsor, Mr Ibrahim, whom he  plainly
    regarded as a credible witness.  The  judge  appears  to  have  thought
    (incorrectly, as things turned out) that the  sponsor  had  been  given
    refugee status. This prompted the judge to embark on a consideration of
    the Rules relating to refugee family reunion.  It is,  however,  common
    ground that the sponsor has never been a refugee; and so that  part  of
    the judge's decision is irrelevant.

 8. As far as concerns paragraph 297, the judge  found  in  favour  of  the
    appellant on the two issues which had caused the Secretary  of  State's
    entry clearance officer to refuse the paragraph  297  application.  The
    judge was satisfied that the appellant  was  the  sponsor's  biological
    child and that the sponsor had sole responsibility for  the  appellant.
    But the judge raised of  his  own  motion  the  issue  of  whether  the
    sponsor's circumstances were such as to enable the  appellant  to  meet
    the requirements of  paragraph  297,  concerning  the  availability  of
    suitable accommodation for her, if admitted to this country. The  judge
    was troubled by the fact that the  sponsor  at  that  time  occupied  a
    studio apartment, comprising a single room.  The judge felt this  might
    not be satisfactory for a 15-year-old girl.  The sponsor said  that  it
    would be his intention to divide the room by a screen in order to  give
    the appellant  the  requisite  amount  of  privacy.   Nevertheless,  at
    paragraph 40 the judge decided that the sponsor should be  required  to
    obtain a surveyor's report relating to the room and  its  adequacy  for
    that purpose.

 9. This brings us to the judge's directions.  At paragraphs 51 and  52  of
    the decision, the judge directed that  a  copy  of  the  grant  by  the
    Secretary of State of refugee status to the sponsor should be filed and
    served. As we have said, that issue has  fallen  away.   Alternatively,
    however, in paragraph 52 the judge directed the  appellant  to  provide
    documentary proof of his landlord's consent to shared occupation of the
    premises; together with a surveyor's report  on  the  adequacy  of  the
    accommodation for occupation by the appellant and the sponsor.  It  was
    because the submission of these materials might demonstrate  compliance
    with the requirements of paragraph 297 that the judge decided to  allow
    the appeal on a conditional basis.

10. It is quite plain that the judge committed a material error of  law  in
    allowing the appeal on a conditional basis.  The scheme of sections  82
    to 86 of the 2002 Act does  not  permit  appeals  to  be  conditionally
    allowed or, for that matter, conditionally dismissed.

11. It is true that amended section 86 no longer states in terms  that  the
    Tribunal must allow the appeal, insofar as it thinks that the  appealed
    decision was not in accordance with the law  or  that  a  discretionary
    decision should have been  exercised  differently;  and  that  it  must
    otherwise dismiss the appeal.  Nevertheless,  the  present  version  of
    section 86(2) continues to  require  the  Tribunal  to  determine  "any
    matter raised as a ground of appeal and ... any matter which section 85
    requires it to consider".   The position, therefore,  continues  to  be
    that the appeal has to be decided. That will require a judge  to  allow
    the appeal in whole or part or to dismiss it in whole  or  part  (or  a
    combination of both).

12.  In the circumstances that arose in the present case, where  the  judge
    raised issues regarding compliance with the Rules that did not  feature
    in the Secretary of State's decision, the  obvious  course  would  have
    been for the judge to have adjourned the matter,  with  directions,  in
    order to establish the factual position on the remaining issues, before
    proceeding to make a decision.  Instead, the judge purported wrongly to
    allow the appeal on a conditional basis. How he thought that an actual,
    unconditional decision would eventually emerge  from  the  Tribunal  is
    entirely unclear. His  decision  contains  no  indication  of  who,  if
    anyone, was to scrutinise and form a view on any materials  that  might
    emanate from the sponsor's landlord and from a surveyor, in response to
    the judge's directions.

13.   For these reasons the Tribunal finds  that  the  judge  committed  an
    error which was plainly a material one. In other words, it affected his
    decision.

14. Mr Jarvis did not pursue the first of the Secretary of State's  grounds
    of application, which contended that the judge had  additionally  erred
    in finding that the decision of the  Secretary  of  State  was  not  in
    accordance with the law.  In the circumstances, we make no  observation
    on that ground, save to say that the judge's reference in paragraph  54
    to the Secretary of State's decision not being in accordance  with  the
    law clearly flowed from and was subsidiary to the judge's  decision  to
    allow the appeal conditionally.

15.  We therefore proceed  to  re-make  the  decision  in  this  case.   We
    reiterate that the provision of the Immigration Rules with which we are
    concerned is paragraph 297.

16. As we have seen, the Entry Clearance Officer was  concerned  about  the
    family relationship between the appellant and the sponsor.  The  First-
    tier  Tribunal  Judge  was  satisfied  from  DNA  evidence  that   that
    relationship had been satisfactorily established. The  judge  was  also
    satisfied that the sponsor had sole responsibility for  the  appellant.
    Notwithstanding the errors in the judge's decision, Mr Jarvis  accepted
    there was no need to revisit these findings. He accepted the judge  was
    entitled to make them.

17.  There was also no issue before the judge as to the  financial  ability
    of the sponsor to provide for the appellant if she were admitted to the
    United Kingdom.  The sponsor works both as a bus driver and  a  minicab
    driver in London and Mr Jarvis correctly raised no issue regarding that
    aspect of the Immigration Rules.

18. The only  potential  problematic  area  of  the  Rules  is  that  which
    concerned the  judge;  namely,  whether  there  would  be  satisfactory
    accommodation for the appellant, if admitted.

19. We said earlier that the fact this appeal is proceeding under  the  new
    appeal provisions in the 2002 Act is relevant to the re-making  of  the
    decision. The reason is as follows.

20. It is no longer the case that the Tribunal, in deciding  an  appeal  of
    this kind, is confined to the evidential situation as  it  was  at  the
    date of the refusal of entry clearance.  Section 85(4) provides that it
    is possible for the Tribunal to consider evidence arising  at  a  later
    time, providing that it does not constitute a "new matter", as  defined
    by section 85(6). It is common ground that the evidence to which we are
    about to refer does not comprise a "new matter".

21. The sponsor gave evidence. He said that,  since  April  2017,  he  been
    living in a council flat, which comprises one bedroom plus  a  separate
    sitting room.  He provided the Tribunal with  written  evidence,  which
    indicated that he had indeed moved home since the  hearing  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal. Mr Jarvis cross-examined the sponsor regarding the
    nature of that accommodation but, having done, so  Mr  Jarvis  made  no
    submissions that  the  sponsor's  evidence  was  incredible  or  should
    otherwise be given no or only limited weight.  For our part,  we  agree
    with Mr Jarvis's stance.  The sponsor is credible.  We are satisfied on
    the balance of probabilities that, if admitted to the  United  Kingdom,
    the appellant would live with the sponsor in a  one-  bedroom  flat  in
    London NW6. There is no other person living in that  accommodation.  We
    find that the accommodation would be suitable for the appellant and the
    sponsor.    Accordingly, the  requirements  of  paragraph  297  of  the
    Immigration Rules are made out.

Notice of Decision

We therefore re-make this decision by allowing the  appeal  under  paragraph
297 of the Immigration Rules.

Fee award

Oddly,  given  the  conditional  nature  of  his  decision,  the  First-tier
Tribunal judge made a fee award in favour of the appellant. That  fee  award
falls with the setting aside of the judge's  decision.  Having  allowed  the
appeal on re-making the decision, we make a whole fee award in  the  sum  of
�140.
