                            DECISION AND REASONS

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008
Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings


1.   The Appellants are citizens  of  Bangladesh.   I  have  anonymised  the
    Appellants to protect the identity of the child. MH's date of birth  is
    15 October 1981. He came to the UK in 2008 on a student visa.   He  was
    granted further leave until 1 January 2016.   However,  his  leave  was
    curtailed on 15 May 2015 with effect from  11  September  2015.  He  is
    married to FE. Her date of birth is 19 July 1990.  Their son, SHF,  was
    born on 1 August 2013. FE and SHF were granted leave in line  with  MH.
    I shall refer to MH as the Appellant throughout this decision.

2.   On 3 February 2016 the Appellant applied for a  residence  card  as  an
    extended family  member  of  an  EEA  national  under  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.  He claimed to be  dependent
    upon an EEA national,  a  relative,  HR,  an  Italian  national.   That
    application was refused by the Secretary of  State.   The  relationship
    was not accepted and neither was dependency.  The  Appellant  appealed.
    The appeal was dismissed by Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (FTT)
    Shamash in  a  decision  that  was  promulgated  on  18  October  2018,
    following a hearing at Taylor House on 17 September  2018.   Permission
    was granted by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Davey on 19 January 2019.


The decision of the FTT

3.   The FTT heard evidence from the Appellant and HR and set  this  out  at
    paragraphs 8 to 17 of the decision.  The judge directed herself on  the
    law at paragraphs 20 to  30  and  set  out  the  relevant  Home  Office
    Guidance at paragraphs  31  and  32.   The  judge  make  the  following
    findings:-

         "33. I accept that the first appellant and sponsor are  related  by
             marriage.  I do  not  think  that  the  distinction  that  the
             respondent has  made  between  the  first,  second  and  third
             appellants is correct  because  the  regulations  are  broadly
             defined and cover those who are related through marriage.   No
             point was taken at  the  hearing  in  relation  to  the  first
             appellant's wife and child and as I have found that the  first
             appellant is the sponsor's cousin-in-law, his wife  and  child
             also meet the requirements.


         34.  I do not accept that the appellants have  provided  sufficient
             evidence to show past and present dependence.  I  accept  that
             the two families are close.  However, I am compelled  to  make
             mixed credibility findings.  For example, I  accept  that  the
             sponsor helped the appellant by paying his fees/travel to  the
             United Kingdom in 2008 and I accept that he  has  periodically
             given him money in the past.  The one receipt  from  2008  and
             the oral evidence are insufficient to  show  past  dependence.
             It was a payment to the appellant's mother at a time when  the
             sponsor was not an EEA national, which both parties stated was
             by way of a contribution towards his travel and studies in the
             UK.  Taking the appellant's evidence at it's (sic) highest  he
             accepted that whilst studying in the UK  this  (sic)  earnings
             and his wife's earnings were sufficient to meet his  essential
             needs.  In fact at times they had  sufficient  money  to  send
             money back to Bangladesh.  Similarly, the  letters  from  [HM]
             and [TK] were inconsistent with Mr [R]'s oral evidence.   They
             stated in their letters that they were given the money  by  Mr
             [R] before they travelled, whereas,  he  stated  that  Mr  [R]
             stated that the money was paid directly  by  them  from  money
             they owed him.  They  have  not  provided  any  identification
             documents, they did not attend the hearing and I attach little
             weight to the letters.


         35.  There was no documentary evidence in this case in relation  to
             current dependence and the appellant's and sponsor's  evidence
             was not consistent.  For example, the appellant was clear that
             the sponsor gives him money every month towards his rent.   He
             said that he gives him �250 - �300  per  month.   The  sponsor
             said he gave the appellant �120 in cash per  month.   He  then
             went on to mention two large payments to the appellant in  the
             period immediately before the  hearing,  which  the  appellant
             failed to mention.  None of the payments were documented.  The
             Guidance  makes  it  plain  that  appellants  should   provide
             documentary evidence and there is almost none  in  this  case.
             There is no evidence of regular transfers of funds or any form
             of  payments  and  the  appellant   and   the   sponsor   were
             inconsistent on this basic point.


         36.  In addition, the (sic) Mr [R]  is  dependent  on  his  younger
             brother in Italy for help and on various benefits in order  to
             meet his everyday needs.  He himself only  works  two  days  a
             week and it would make a nonsense  of  the  legislation  if  a
             sponsor was able to use benefits acquired from  the  State  in
             order to support another family.  In this case the sponsor  is
             working two days a week earning a relatively small wage.   His
             benefits of �800 exceed his earned income of �700  per  month.
             The additional sums that he receives from the  State  are  not
             just a carer's allowance, he receives support for  low  income
             families and makes it less likely that he  would  be  able  to
             meet another family's essential needs when he cannot meet  his
             own essential needs.


         37.  Thus, there was insufficient  evidence  of  prior  dependence.
             Secondly,  the  oral  evidence  of  current   dependence   was
             inconsistent.   There  were  clear  and  marked  discrepancies
             between the first appellant and the sponsor's  evidence  which
             were so significant that I find  that  they  cannot  establish
             past or present dependence.  I find that the  appellants  have
             not shown that they are dependent on  the  sponsor.   For  the
             reasons set out above I find that the lack of documentation in
             this case and the discrepancies in  the  oral  evidence  which
             related very specifically to the amounts of  discrepancies  in
             the oral evidence  which  related  very  specifically  to  the
             amounts of money that were given mean that the appellants have
             not discharged the burden of proof."

Conclusions

4.   Three days before the hearing, on 14 September  2018,  the  represented
    Appellant submitted further evidence; namely, a witness statement  from
    his mother in Bangladesh dated 13 June 2018. Attached  to  the  witness
    statement there was evidence  of  a  money  transfer  from  HR  to  the
    Appellant dated 10 June 2008. The evidence was served as an "additional
    bundle".  The judge was clearly aware of  the  money  transfer  receipt
    (see paragraph 9 of her decision).  Throughout the decision she did not
    mention  the  mother's  witness  statement.   She   referred   to   the
    Appellant's bundle containing 246 pages, but  not  to  the  "additional
    bundle" which had been served at the last minute.  Mr West informed  me
    that he handed the "additional bundle" to the judge at the start of the
    hearing.  Mr West has not submitted a witness statement and  indeed  he
    continues to represent the Appellant  and  is  therefore  cannot  be  a
    witness. However, there is no  reason  for  me  to  believe  that  that
    statement was not before  the  judge  because  it  is  clear  from  her
    decision that she took into account the receipt which was  attached  to
    it.  I accept that she did not make findings on  it,  however,  whether
    this amounts to a material error of  law  is  an  issue  which  I  must
    determine.

5.   The judge heard evidence from the Appellant and HR.  She  accepted  the
    relationship  as  claimed.  Therefore,  the  determinative  issue   was
    dependency.   She  properly  set  out  the  law  in  her  decision.   I
    specifically refer to paragraph 27 where the judge  set  out  the  head
    note of Dauhoo [2012] UKUT 79. She went onto direct herself in relation
    to dependency in the paragraphs following.  There is  no  challenge  to
    the self-direction.  The case was advanced before the FTT on the  basis
    that there was prior and present dependency.

6.   I have considered the  Appellant's  mother's  witness  statement.    My
    first observation is that  it  is  not  clear  why  this  evidence  was
    submitted at the eleventh hour, particularly considering it  was  dated
    13 June 2018. There has never been an explanation for this.  It is  not
    clear how the statement was obtained. The Appellant's mother resides in
    Bangladesh. The statement is in English and there  is  no  translation.
    In any event, she states that HR started  to  give  the  Appellant  and
    family money in 2002. He used to send them monthly  amounts  which  was
    used for living expenses because the family  was  not  getting  support
    from her husband  (the  Appellant's  father)  who  was  at  that  point
    estranged.  In 2008 HR sent the family a substantial sum  amounting  to
    approximately 8 lacs for the  Appellant's  tuition  fees.  The  receipt
    attached to her witness statements  supports  this.   He  continued  to
    support the family on a frequent basis.  The judge accepted that  there
    was a payment made in 2008 and that HR had given money periodically  to
    the Appellant during the period between 2004 and 2008.  The evidence of
    the receipt is  evidence  capable  of  supporting  that  a  payment  of
    7,405.60 Euros was made to the Appellant from HR. The  judge  may  have
    erred when observing the payment was made to  the  Appellant's  mother.
    However, contrary to the assertions made in the grounds, nothing  turns
    on this.  Critically HR was not an EEA national at this point, as found
    by the judge at paragraph 34. This is not challenged in the grounds. Mr
    West confirmed to me that HR did not become an EEA national until 2014.
     The judge may well have erred when concluding, at  paragraph  9,  that
    the receipt was evidence of a payment of �800, however, this  may  have
    been  a  typographical  error.   In  any  event,  whilst  there  is   a
    significant difference between �800 and  E7,405.60  it  is  simply  not
    material to this appeal.  Nothing turns on it because at this  time  HR
    was not an EEA national as found by the judge and, in  any  event,  the
    judge accepted that a payment had been made.  The receipt was the  only
    piece of documentary evidence establishing that a payment had been made
    to  the  Appellant  during  a  period  relied  on  to  establish  prior
    dependency (between 2004 and 2008) many years  before  HR  was  an  EEA
    national exercising treaty rights.

7.   It is argued in the grounds that the judge erred at paragraph  34  when
    she recorded that while studying in the UK the Appellant and his wife's
    earnings were sufficient to meet his  essential  needs.   This  is  not
    accepted by the Appellant who claims that his evidence was that  during
    the time he was studying, HR continued to  support  him,  albeit  to  a
    lesser extent.  This ground like others relied on by the Appellant is a
    bare assertion that the judge incorrectly recorded evidence.  There has
    been no proper response to the grant  of  permission  by  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Davey in this respect. At  no  time  has  the  Appellant
    asked  for  disclosure  of  the  Record  of  Proceedings  supported  by
    disclosure of Counsel's note of the hearing.  The  Appellant  does  not
    rely on the evidence of Mr West who represented him before the FTT.  In
    any event, Mr West continued to represent the Appellant before  the  UT
    and cannot be a witness.

8.   The judge had evidence in the form of letters  from  two  witnesses  (M
    and K) and concluded that their  evidence  was  inconsistent  with  the
    HR's.  The judge gave reasons for this. Contrary to  the  assertion  in
    the grounds, the reasons given are comprehensible. The  judge  recorded
    HR's evidence was that friends in Italy would travel to the UK and give
    the Appellant money on his behalf.  There was no evidence  that  before
    the  judge  that  M  and  K  lived  in  Italy  and   no   evidence   of
    identification. They did not attend the hearing to give live  evidence.
    HR 's evidence as recorded at paragraph 15 is as follows: "... He  said
    that his friends had paid back some of the money that they owed him  by
    giving it directly to the Appellant ...".   M said  that  HR  gave  him
    �2,500 to hand to the Appellant in January 2013 when  he  travelled  to
    the UK. K's evidence was that HR gave him HR  �3,000  to  give  to  the
    Appellant in August 2013.  The judge drew a reasonable  inference  from
    the evidence and was entitled to conclude that HR 's evidence  was  not
    consistent with that of M and K.  It is asserted that the  judge  erred
    and mistook the evidence of HR. This is wholly unsupported.  The  judge
    reasonably interpreted the evidence that was before her and the grounds
    do not identify an error.

9.    In respect of present dependency, it is asserted in the  grounds  that
    the judge did not apply the Home Office Guidance  when  she  stated  at
    paragraph 35 that "The Guidance makes it plain that  Appellants  should
    provide documentary evidence and there is almost none  in  this  case."
    However, the assertion is wholly unarguable.   The judge sets  out  the
    policy relied upon by the Appellant at paragraph 32 as follows:-

         "have (sic) looked at  the  Guidance  to  Caseworkers  relating  to
         dependency and it reads as follows:


             'You must consider the following:


                . Does the applicant need financial support  to  meet  their
                  essential needs from the EEA  national,  their  spouse  or
                  civil partner.


                . If the applicant cannot meet their essential living  needs
                  without the financial support of the  EEA  national,  they
                  must be considered dependent even  if  they  also  receive
                  financial support or income somewhere else.


             You do not need to consider  the  reasons  why  the  applicant
             needs the financial  support  or  whether  they  are  able  to
             support  themselves  by  working.   Essential  needs   include
             accommodation utilities and food.  Dependency will normally be
             shown by financial documents that show money being sent by the
             sponsor to the  applicant.   If  the  applicant  is  receiving
             financial support from the EEA national as well as others they
             must show that the support from the EEA national is supporting
             their essential needs.  The applicant  does  not  need  to  be
             dependent.


             The applicant does not need to be dependent  on  the  relevant
             EEA national to meet all or most  of  their  essential  needs.
             For example, an applicant can still be considered dependent if
             they receive a pension to cover half of their essential  needs
             and money from the relevant EEA national to  cover  the  other
             half.  Under proof of dependency it reads:


                       The applicant must provide proof of their  dependency
                  this can include:


                    . Bank or building society statements.


                    . Evidence of money transfers.


                    .  Evidence  of  living  in  the  same   household   if
                      applicable.


                    . Other evidence to show their EEA national sponsor has
                      enough money to support them  and  the  applicant  is
                      reliant on them for this.'"

10.  The judge did not determine this appeal on the basis  that  documentary
    evidence is mandatory. She reasonably  expected  that  there  would  be
    corroborative   evidence,   particularly   of   post-dependency.    Her
    interpretation of the  guidance  that  there  "should"  be  documentary
    evidence is reasonable. Her findings must be considered in the light of
    the extraordinary  dearth  of  documentary  evidence  produced  by  the
    Appellant in support of prior or post-dependency.

11.  It is asserted in the grounds  that  the  judge  wrongly  recorded  the
    Appellant's evidence at paragraph 35. In respect of the amount of money
    that he said he received from the HR which led  her  to  conclude  that
    there was an inconsistency in the evidence.  Again, this  assertion  is
    wholly unsupported.  There is no reason to conclude that the judge made
    a mistake and she was wholly entitled to conclude that the evidence was
    inconsistent.

12.  The grounds take issue with paragraph 36 of the decision.   Suffice  to
    say that these were matters that the judge was wholly entitled to  take
    into account.  Although I do not necessarily agree with the judge  that
    someone on benefits could not  for  the  purposes  of  the  Regulations
    support a family member, the judge was entitled to attach weight to the
    evidence that  HR was supported by his brother in Italy and that he was
    in receipt of support because he has a low  income  and  was  therefore
    less likely to meet some of the Appellant's essential needs.

13.  It was agreed by the parties that the  judge  accurately  set  out  the
    test at paragraph 28 onwards. It was agreed that essential needs do not
    have to be all of the Appellant's essential needs.   Whilst  the  judge
    does not specifically  refer  to  the  test  when  she  summarised  her
    conclusions at paragraph 37, it was not necessary for her to do so. She
    had already adequately set it out at paragraphs 28 and  30.  The  issue
    here  was  not  whether  HR's  support  covered  all  or  some  of  the
    Appellant's essential needs. Whilst the judge accepted that HR  had  in
    the past given the Appellant money with reference to the  2008  receipt
    and that he periodically gave him money in the  past  (see  [34]),  the
    evidence did not come close to establishing  dependency  in  the  sense
    that it covered some of the Appellant's essential needs.  In any  event
    HR was not an EEA national at the time it is asserted there  was  prior
    dependency.  In  either  case  the  dependency  or  membership  of  the
    household must be on a person who is an EEA national  at  the  material
    time. The appeal cannot therefore succeed  with  reference  to  Dauhoo.
    Moreover, the judge did not accept any element of  present  dependency.



14.  The  judge  was  entitled  to  conclude  that  there  was  insufficient
    evidence and that the oral evidence  was  inconsistent.   She  did  not
    conclude  that  the  documentary  evidence  or  the  lack  of  it   was
    determinative of the outcome, but it was a  matter  that  she  properly
    attached weight to. This was not inconsistent with the  policy  of  the
    Home Office which  she  set  out.   The  Appellant's  mother's  witness
    statement has no material bearing upon the outcome in this case.  I  am
    not persuaded that the judge did not consider it in any event.  She did
    not have to make findings on each piece of evidence. She may have taken
    the view that it was not necessary because it took the Appellant's case
    no further. In any event, I have considered whether there is a material
    error on the basis  that  she  did  not  take  it  into  account.   The
    evidential value of it is limited for the reasons I have  given.   Part
    of her evidence is accepted (the payment in 2008  and  that  there  was
    some support). However, there was no supporting  evidence  of  frequent
    payments having been made.  The Appellant's case was problematic for  a
    number of reasons properly identified by  the  judge.  The  Appellant's
    mother's statement once considered in  the  round  is  not  capable  of
    making any difference to the outcome in this case. In  any  event,  the
    insurmountable problem for this Appellant is that there can be no prior
    dependency because at the critical time HR  was  not  an  EEA  national
    exercising treaty rights. It is simply unarguable that the evidence  of
    the Appellant's mother could have made a  material  difference  to  the
    outcome in this appeal.

15.  The grounds in my view are insufficiently  particularised,  unsupported
    and amount to a disagreement with the findings of the FTT.   They  fail
    to properly identify an arguable error  of  law  capable  of  making  a
    difference to  the  outcome  in  this  case.   There  were  significant
    problems with the evidence. The Appellant's  case  was  unsupported  by
    independent and documentary evidence.  Furthermore, there is no support
    for the contention that the judge misapplied the policy  and  to  claim
    otherwise misrepresents the findings.  There  is  no  support  for  the
    assertion that the judge did not accurately record the evidence.

16.  I am not impressed with the presentation of the  appeal.  I  understand
    that Mr West is Counsel and I do not seek to blame him. His  solicitors
    have conduct of the case insofar as the preparation  of  a  bundle  and
    witness statements are concerned. The statements produced in  the  main
    bundle are deficient. They fail to set out the Appellant's case with  a
    degree  of  necessary  clarity  and  detail  reasonably  expected.  The
    witnesses gave oral evidence very much outside of them.  The  statement
    of the mother was served out of time. No reason was advanced for  this.
    The judge heard oral evidence and made what she could  of  it,  drawing
    reasonable inferences and reaching rational conclusions.   It  was  for
    Appellant to establish that he met the requirements of the Regulations.
    He could not do so for a number of reasons.  It  was  asserted  in  the
    grounds that the judge did not understand  the  evidence.  Despite  the
    problems in the presentation of this case and the  lack  of  assistance
    from the solicitors, the judge's  understanding  of  the  case  was  an
    accurate reflection of how it was advanced before her.

Notice of Decision

17.  In the absence of a material error of law, the decision of the  FTT  to
    dismiss  the  Appellant's  appeal  under  the   2006   Regulations   is
    maintained.
