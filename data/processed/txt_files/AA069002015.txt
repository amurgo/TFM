Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Clarke, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms A Radford, Counsel, instructed by Turpin & Miller
                    LLP (Fountain House)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant, the Secretary of State, has been granted  permission  to
    appeal the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Page allowing the
    appeal of the respondent  under  Article  15(c)  of  the  Qualification
    Directive on the basis that the change  in  the  country  situation  in
    Afghanistan  indicates  that   the   respondent   should   be   granted
    humanitarian protection until it can be demonstrated that he  could  be
    returned there  safely.   The  judge  also  allowed  the  appeal  under
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(vii)  on the basis that having allowed  the  appeal
    under Article 15(c), as the respondent is a vulnerable person who  came
    to the UK as an unaccompanied minor, he would face serious obstacles to
    safe integration into Afghanistan on return.

2.   The respondent is a national of Afghanistan born  on  [  ]  1997.   His
    previous asylum appeal was dismissed  in  the  determination  of  Judge
    Roopnarine-Davies on 25  November  2011.   The  judge  found  that  the
    respondent's asylum claim was not credible.  The judge held, so far  as
    the humanitarian protection issues were concerned, that it had not been
    shown that either in Kabul or Laghman the level of  violence  was  such
    that without anything to render the  respondent  a  particular  target,
    there was a real risk to his life or personal  safety  there.   So  the
    judge dismissed the  respondent's  appeal  on  asylum  grounds  and  on
    humanitarian protection grounds.   Nevertheless,  being  a  minor,  the
    respondent was granted discretionary leave  until  17  September  2014,
    until he had reached the age of  17ï¿½  years,  in  accordance  with  the
    respondent's policy.

3.   The respondent reached the age of majority on 17 March 2015,  and  made
    a further application for leave to remain on asylum grounds.  The basis
    of his claim was that he feared returning  to  Afghanistan  because  he
    would be taken by the Taliban and forced to work  for  them.   He  also
    feared that he would be killed by the Taliban for  leaving  Afghanistan
    when the Taliban had requested him  to  join  them.   In  refusing  the
    respondent's application, the Secretary of State held that it would not
    be unduly harsh for him to be returned to his home area in  Afghanistan
    in Laghman province.  Alternatively, the respondent could  relocate  to
    another area within Afghanistan, for example, Kabul.  The Secretary  of
    State also found that the respondent failed to meet the requirements of
    276ADE(i)(vi) in that he had failed to establish that there  were  very
    significant  obstacles  to  his  integration  into  Afghanistan  if  he
    returned there.

4.   In reaching his conclusions  the  judge  agreed  with  the  conclusions
    reached by Judge Roopnarine-Davies insofar as  the  credibility  issues
    were concerned.  The respondent's asylum claim was found to be  lacking
    in credibility and there was no difference to that claim.

5.   In reaching his conclusions the judge held as follows:

         "21. However, as Mr Joseph has submitted in his  skeleton  argument
             dated 4 December 2015, the security situation  in  Afghanistan
             has changed much - and for the worse.  I  have  revisited  the
             judge's conclusions in the light  of  the  objective  evidence
             that Mr Joseph  has  relied  on  and  it  is  plain  that  the
             situation has  deteriorated  substantially  since  2011.   The
             appellant's appeal under Article 15(c)  of  the  Qualification
             Directive is based on the compelling evidence published  since
             the country  guidance  to  show  that  the  appellant  has  an
             arguable case for subsidiary protection under  Article  15(c).
             At paragraph 12 of Mr Joseph's skeleton argument he refers  to
             the objective evidence to show that between 1 January  and  30
             June 2015 there were 4,921 civilian casualties (1,592 civilian
             deaths  and  3,329  injured).   This  is   recorded   in   the
             OHCHR/UNAMA Afghanistan Mid-Year Report  2015:  Protection  of
             Civilians in Armed Conflict, dated 4 August 2015, this  is  to
             be found at pages 40-122 of the  appellant's  bundle.   For  1
             January to  30  June  2015,  UNAMA  documented  196  abduction
             incidents, almost all carried out by anti-government elements,
             which resulted in 76 civilian casualties  (62  deaths  and  14
             injured), marking  a  37%  increase  in  the  number  of  such
             incidents and  a  117%  increase  in  casualties  relating  to
             abductions compared to the same period in 2014.

         22.  Apparent dissention within and between anti-government element
             groups  contributed  to  the  emergence  of  groups   pledging
             allegiance to  the  terrorist  organisation  known  as  Daesh.
             UNAMA also observed that the emergence of groups  claiming  to
             be affiliated with  Daesh  raises  serious  concerns  for  the
             civilian population as a whole.  I remind myself  of  the  low
             standard of proof that I must apply in this  appeal  and  this
             disturbing new objective  evidence  causes  me  to  doubt  the
             safety of the findings of the Upper  Tribunal  in  R  (on  the
             application of Naziri and Others) IJR [2015] UKUT 00437.   The
             Upper Tribunal did not have the UNAMA Report  dated  4  August
             2015 in evidence but did have the UNAMA  Report  published  in
             February 2015.

         23.  The substance of the respondent's decision  in  under  appeal,
             not the authority of the Upper Tribunal.  The  respondent  has
             given weight to what  the  respondent  considered  to  be  the
             'current  country  guidance  case'  of  AK   (Article   15(c))
             Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT.  In that country guidance case the
             Tribunal found that the level of  indiscriminate  violence  in
             Afghanistan taken as a whole was not at such a high  level  to
             mean  that,  within  the  meaning  of  Article  15(c)  of  the
             Qualification Directive, a civilian, solely by  being  present
             in the country, faced a real risk which threatened his life or
             person.  The appellant in this appeal has relied on  the  more
             recent cases and Mr Joseph has presented a compelling argument
             that the escalation in civil strife  in  Afghanistan  is  such
             that the country guidance cases need to be  revisited  in  the
             light of changing conditions there.  I  am  satisfied  to  the
             lower standard of proof that the appellant would face  a  real
             risk  of  indiscriminate  harm  should  he  be   returned   to
             Afghanistan; particularly as a young vulnerable person who has
             been out of the country since he was 14 years old."

6.   Ms Radford's argued that there was no difficulty in  understanding  the
    judge's thought process when he reached  the  finding  that  the  civil
    strife in Afghanistan has escalated  and  the  security  situation  has
    increased to such an extent that the respondent would face a real  risk
    of  indiscriminate  harm  should  he  be   returned   to   Afghanistan,
    particularly as a young and vulnerable person who had been out  of  the
    country since he was 14 years old.  She submitted that in view  of  the
    objective evidence from UNAMA dated 4 August 2015, which postdated  the
    UNAMA Report published in February 2015 which  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    Naziri had relied on, the  judge's  decision  not  to  rely  on  Naziri
    disclosed no error of law.

7.   I was not persuaded by Ms Radford's submissions.

8.   I accept as held by the Upper Tribunal in DSG & Others  (Afghan  Sikhs:
    departure from CG) Afghanistan [2013] UKUT 00148 (IAC) that a judge may
    depart from existing country guidance in the circumstances described in
    Practice Direction 12.2 and 12.4 and the UT (IAC) Guidance  Note  2011,
    No. 2, paragraphs 11 and 12.  The basic principle is that a  judge  has
    to show why a country guidance case does  not  apply  to  the  case  in
    question.

9.   Naziri is not a country guidance decision.  At [63] the Upper  Tribunal
    held that in the United Kingdom, the leading  decision  of  the  higher
    courts dealing with Article 15(c) remains  QD  (Iraq)  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2011] 1 WLR 689.  QD helpfully  explains
    how Elgafaji should be applied.  In addition they had the guidance  set
    out in HM and others (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2012] UKUT 409 (IAC).

10.  The judge was right in saying that the Upper  Tribunal  in  Naziri  had
    the UNAMA Report published in February 2015 and not  the  UNAMA  report
    dated 4 August 2015.  However the Upper Tribunal  noted  at  [35]  that
    "one of the central themes of the report is the increasing toll of  the
    conflict on civilians" which is  reflected  in  the  rise  of  civilian
    casualties. I find that as the judge appears to  have  also  relied  on
    this central theme in light of the UNAMA Report of August 2015 to reach
    his conclusions, it was difficult to  understand  why  he  doubted  the
    safety of the findings in Naziri.

11.  The judge did not rely on any of the cases  cited  at  [9]  above.   He
    relied on AK.  The judge held that the respondent  would  face  a  real
    risk of indiscriminate harm  should  he  be  returned  to  Afghanistan,
    particularly as a young vulnerable person  who  has  been  out  of  the
    country since he was 14 years old.  The judge failed to consider  other
    factors, such as whether the  respondent  has  family  in  Afghanistan,
    either in Kabul or Laghman province, who can provide him with  a  home,
    security and support and whether he will be able  to  find  employment.
    Failure to consider such matters was an error of law.

12.  I find that the judge erred in law in finding that the  respondent  met
    the requirement  of  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi).   The  judge  based  his
    decision on his finding on the Article 15(c) issue. As the judge failed
    to identify the evidence which led him  to  find  that  the  respondent
    would face serious obstacles to safe integration  into  Afghanistan  on
    return his decision is not safe, his decision cannot stand.

13.  I find that the  judge  erred  in  law  for  the  reasons  given.   His
    decision cannot stand.  The judge's decision is set aside in  order  to
    be remade.

14.  As Ms Radford,  submitted  that  the  respondent  would  have  to  give
    evidence about his personal circumstances,  I  agreed  that  this  case
    should go back to the First Tier Tribunal  be  heard  by  a  First-tier
    Judge other than FtTJ Page.
