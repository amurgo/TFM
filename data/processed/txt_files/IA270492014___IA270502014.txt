Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr Khan of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of Nepal.  The first appellant was born  on
    25 October 1987 and the second appellant, her husband and dependant was
    born on 1 March 1987.  The appellants appealed against the respondent's
    decision dated 13 June 2013 to refuse to vary leave to  remain  and  to
    make removal directions under  s.47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.

 2. The application of the first appellant,  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
    Migrant was refused on  the  basis  that  she  had  failed  to  produce
    evidence of maintenance (funds) to meet the requirements of Appendix  C
    of the Immigration Rules.  The refusal letter set out  that  the  first
    appellant had provided bank statements but had not shown  the  required
    maintenance fee of ï¿½3,300 for a consecutive period to meet the  Tier  4
    (General) Student Migrant maintenance requirements under  paragraph  1A
    of Appendix C of the Rules.  The notice of decision recorded that  bank
    statements had been provided by the appellant's  husband  Anwar  Husain
    but the information was rejected because he did not meet the particular
    requirement of paragraph 13 of Appendix C as being a source  of  funds.
    The only source of funds provided under paragraph 13 of Appendix C were
    those funds held by the applicant (where there  was  a  sole  or  joint
    account holder); and/or  the  applicant's  parents  or  legal  guardian
    and/or official financial sponsors.

 3. The second appellant's application for leave to remain as the dependant
    of a Tier 4 Migrant was refused solely on the basis of the  refusal  of
    the first appellant's application and the Secretary of State not  being
    satisfied that he was the spouse of a person who  had  valid  leave  to
    remain as a points-based migrant.  He fell for refusal under  paragraph
    319C(b) of the Rules.

 4. The appellants'  appeals  were  allowed  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Davey (the judge) in a decision  promulgated  on  27  February
    2015.  He found that with the evidence provided by the first  appellant
    at the hearing, it was plain that the second appellant had provided the
    funding, had met the tuition fees and that he held the necessary  funds
    in the Kumari Bank of Nepal.  The first appellant having previously had
    a bank account in Nepal but at the Kathmandu Bank Limited,  had  closed
    that account when she came to the United Kingdom and opened an  account
    here with Lloyds Bank plc.  The judge found the cause  of  the  refusal
    was inaction on the part of the appellants' representatives, no  longer
    in business who had failed to communicate problems  over  documentation
    to the appellants.  The judge found  there  was  no  challenge  to  the
    credibility of those problems and their cause  being  entirely  outwith
    the conduct of the appellants.

 5. The judge heard argument that the Immigration Rules were irrational and
    did not address, presumably because of oversight, the provision that  a
    husband might provide for his wife.  The judge was taken to the Tier  4
    guidance.  He could find nothing there in relation  to  Appendix  C  on
    alternative sources of funding, outside the express provision  of  [13]
    of Appendix C.  Nevertheless, the judge noted in relation  to  Appendix
    FM sources for meeting the financial requirements that it  contemplated
    income and cash savings of an applicant's partner such  that  in  those
    circumstances it seemed to the judge in the context of Appendix FM that
    the Secretary of State had in mind that there would be partners  and/or
    spouses who could make a financial contribution.  As  he  put  it,  the
    only sensible explanation which struck him was that it was assumed that
    a student's financial support would come from parents, legal  guardians
    and official sponsors and the possibility of  mature  married  students
    with families, appeared to have been overlooked by  the  provisions  in
    Tier 4.

 6. The judge found there was nothing to  suggest  the  second  appellant's
    funds were not available to meet the maintenance costs.  There  was  no
    dispute that the second appellant had funded the fees for the course.

 7. As the Presenting Officer was unable  to  provide  any  explanation  to
    justify the rationale for excluding  a  husband's  funding,  the  judge
    found the  respondent's  decision  showed  no  rational  basis  or  any
    reasoning other than by the  terms  of  the  Rules.   He  compared  the
    situation with Tier 1 applications that permitted a much wider group of
    sponsors and found  it  hard  to  find  any  possible  reason  for  the
    limitation on a bona fide sponsor for a  Tier  4  mature  student.   He
    found it was undisputed before  him  that  at  the  material  date  the
    relevant funding was in place to meet the maintenance requirements  for
    the first and second appellants such that he found there was  no  basis
    for refusal, all other  points  being  accumulated  under  the  Tier  4
    requirements.  Equally, in those circumstances there was  no  basis  to
    refuse the second appellant's application.

 8. In conclusion, the judge found the Secretary of State had made an error
    of law and allowed the  appeals  to  the  extent  that  they  would  be
    remitted to be remade by the Secretary of State, no doubt  taking  into
    account the clear financial evidence provided by the second appellant.

 9. The grounds claimed the judge  made  a  material  error  of  law.   The
    account in the name of the appellant's husband was not permitted by the
    Rules as his wife, the student applicant, was neither the sole or joint
    account holder of that account.

10. Judge Pooler granted leave to appeal the judge's decision on  22  April
    2015.  He found it was arguable that the judge erred in law by  failing
    to direct himself in terms of the Immigration Rules and  in  particular
    those in Appendix C, [13] as to the source of funds.

Submissions on Error of Law

11. Ms Isherwood submitted that the judge's decision could not  stand.   He
    was dealing with a Tier 4 application and  the  Rules  clearly  defined
    where the evidence was to come from.

12. Mr Khan submitted that the judge found what he described as  a  gap  in
    the Rules.  He drew  my  attention  to  [7]  and  [8]  of  the  judge's
    decision.  The judge was entitled to fill the gap by reference to other
    Rules.  Mr Khan submitted that the Rules could  not  be  applied  in  a
    draconian fashion and that the judge was entitled to take  a  pragmatic
    approach.

Conclusion on Error of Law

13. The judge examined the Tier 4 guidance  and  found  it  was  silent  on
    alternative sources of funding.  It might well be that  the  Presenting
    Officer was unable to provide or argue any explanation to  justify  the
    rationale of excluding the funding provided by the appellant's husband,
    however, the judge had  no  discretion  in  the  matter.   He  was  not
    entitled to take a pragmatic approach.  The first appellant clearly did
    not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

14. The judge erred for the reasons I have set out in allowing the  appeal.
    His decision is set aside.  I re-make the decision  by  dismissing  the
    appeal.
