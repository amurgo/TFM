JUDGE MCGEACHY:


Introduction


1.   The claimant applies for judicial review of  a  decision  made  by  the
       defendant local authority ("the defendant") on  19  June  2013  which
       assessed him to be an adult.  Permission to apply for judicial review
       was granted by Sales J on 2 October  2013  and  the  application  was
       transferred to the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) by
       order of His Honour Judge Cooke sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge,
       on 24 April 2014 pursuant to Section 31A(iii) of  the  Senior  Courts
       Act 1981.


2.   The claimant arrived in Britain on or around 3 April 2013  and  claimed
       asylum.  He asserted that he was from Sudan  and  that  his  date  of
       birth was 15 December 1997.   That  was  not  accepted  by  the  Home
       Office, who referred him for an age assessment.


3.   On 3 April 2013 he was placed in a temporary placement  with  a  foster
       carer, Sajjad Abid, until the age assessment could be completed.  The
       foster carer considered that the claimant was  much  older  than  his
       claimed age and the following day stated that he  felt  uncomfortable
       with the situation as there were other young  people  living  in  the
       placement and he did not want to accommodate the claimant any longer.
        The claimant was then placed  in  bed  and  breakfast  accommodation
       pending the outcome of the age assessment.


4.   On 24 April 2013 two assessing social workers, Ken Facey  and  Adetunji
       Oyeleye, assessed the claimant's age and in their decision  dated  13
       May they stated that:-


           "With  the  information  obtained  for  the  purposes  of   this
           interview we have given consideration to AH's history,  physical
           appearance, demeanour, culture, and religion and have given  him
           the benefit of doubt to maintain his claimed  age  of  15  years
           old".


5.    The  defendant  therefore  accepted  responsibility  to  provide   the
       claimant with accommodation and support  as  an  unaccompanied  minor
       pursuant to Section 20 of the Children Act 1989.  On 13 May  2013  he
       was placed in a foster care placement with  Mrs  Tsega  Weldegebriel.
       Mrs Weldegebriel considered, however, that the  appellant  was  older
       than his claimed age and told the supervising social worker, Ms Amber
       Constable,  on  17  May  2013  that  she  considered  that   he   was
       considerably older.


6.   On 31  May  the  defendant  was  told  by  the  Home  Office  that  the
       claimant's biometric data (fingerprints) matched those  of  an  adult
       who had previously claimed asylum in Italy under the name of MIAZ,  a
       national of Chad whose date of birth was 1 January 1994.


7.   The Home Office then  reconsidered  the  claimant's  asylum  claim  and
       applied to  Italy  to  accept  responsibility  under  the  Dublin  II
       Regulation (Council Regulation) (EC) No 343/2003.  On 27 May 2013 the
       Italian Interior Ministry accepted responsibility for determining the
       claimant's asylum claim.


8.   On 5 June 2013 a looked after child review  was  convened  to  consider
       the claimant's welfare.  Doubts about the age of  the  claimant  were
       raised  on  that  occasion  following  the  views  expressed  by  Mrs
       Weldegebriel, the allocated social worker, Susan  Akingbeme  and  the
       supervising social worker Amber Constable.


9.   On 19 June Mr Facey and Mr Oleleye, the claimant's  age  assessors  met
       with the claimant to review  his  age  assessment  in  light  of  the
       information received from the Home Office and the concerns raised  by
       his foster carer and social workers.  The age assessment was  revised
       and it was concluded that the claimant was an adult.


10.  The claimant was then moved from the foster carer's  accommodation  and
       the support of the defendant and eventually  dispersed to  Birmingham
       where he was accommodated by NASS.


The Law


11.  Following the judgment of the Supreme Court in  R  (A)  v  Croydon  LBC
       [2009] 1 WLR 2557 it is for me to resolve the issue of the claimant's
       age as a matter of fact.  I note that in R (AE) v London  Borough  of
       Croydon [2012] EWCA Civ 547 Aikens LJ said that:-


           "This is because the determination of the young person's age  is
           a  'precedent  fact'  to  the  local  authority  exercising  its
           statutory powers under Section 20(1) of the 1989 Act.  There  is
           a right and a wrong answer and  that,  ultimately,  is  for  the
           court to decide."


12.  In carrying out that exercise I must act in an inquisitorial  role  and
       decide, on the balance of probabilities, whether the claimant was  or
       was not a child at the material time.  There is no burden of proof in
       these proceedings.  It is not for me to apply a standard of proof  of
       "benefit of the doubt" but it  is  for  me  to  make  a  "sympathetic
       assessment of evidence" and


           "in evaluating the evidence it  may  well  be  inappropriate  to
           expect  from  the  claimant  conclusive  evidence  of   age   in
           circumstances in which he has  arrived  unattended  and  without
           original identity documents.  The nature of  the  evaluation  of
           evidence would depend on the particular facts of  the  case"  (R
           (CJ) v Cardiff CC).


13.  Over five days I heard evidence from the claimant, Mohammed Ayub,  with
       whom he lived in NASS accommodation, II,  who  claimed  to  be  of  a
       similar age to the claimant and to have known him  in  Sudan,  ZH,  a
       friend of the claimant who also claimed to be from the same region of
       Sudan, Helen Johnson, the Operation Manager at the  Children  section
       of the Refugee Council in Croydon, Mandy Ross, who knows the claimant
       through the Birmingham Community Hosting Network  Family  Befriending
       Scheme - "BIRCH", which is a scheme where local families are  trained
       to befriend young refugees living in the UK without  their  families,
       and Elizabeth Bell, who is a project worker for My-Place,  a  project
       supporting young refugees who are aged 13 - 21 years old and who live
       in Birmingham or Coventry: she is  also  a  project  coordinator  for
       BIRCH.  There was also in the papers a statement  from  TS,  who  had
       lived with the claimant in  the  same  foster  care  placement.   He,
       however, did not give evidence.  Finally, there is a  statement  from
       Francesco Jeff, the claimant's litigation friend, who  also  did  not
       give evidence.


14.  For the defendant I heard evidence from the supervising social  worker,
       Amber Constable, the foster carer Tsega Weldegebriel, the  claimant's
       allocated social worker between May and June  2013,  Susan  Akingbeme
       and Mr Adetunji Oyeleye, who  was  one  of  the  two  social  workers
       employed by the defendant who had undertaken the age assessment on 25
       April 2013 and the review age assessment on 19 June 2013.  There  was
       also a statement from  Liston  Williams,  who  was  employed  by  the
       defendant, as a looked after children's reviewing officer  and  child
       protection chair practitioner, who chaired  the  looked  after  child
       review.


15.  There were also reports in the papers from  Peter  Verney,  a  Sudanese
       country expert who had met with the claimant and had interviewed  him
       and  from  Dr  Christopher  Lukas  on  "mutual  eligibility  of  Arab
       dialects" - his report related to the claimant's  assertion  that  he
       had  difficulties  understanding  the  Iraqi  interpreter   who   had
       interpreted for him at the Home Office.


16.  Over the course of the hearing further  information  from  the  Italian
       authorities came to light regarding the  information  given  by  MIAZ
       which indicated that he  had  entered  Italy  by  air  and  had  been
       apprehended at Rome Airport.


Evidence of the Claimant


17.   The  claimant  had  provided  three  statements  and  also  gave  oral
       evidence. In the first statement, dated 7 August  2013  the  claimant
       explained that he was then homeless and had no money to buy food  but
       would get some food at the mosque. He stated that he did not like the
       accommodation at Brickstock House, to which he had been  moved  after
       leaving the foster carer accommodation, as it was for adults  and  he
       felt intimidated there.  He asserted that he had  given  his  correct
       details to the Italian authorities and that he was not Moussa Issakha
       Abdraman Zene.


18.  In his third statement the claimant set out his history.  He said  that
       he came from Khutum in Darfur and had left  there  in  November  2011
       after his father, MHH, his mother,  FHSD,  and  his  eldest  brother,
       HMHH, had been killed,  as had his uncle.  He  said  that  he  had  a
       younger brother, AMHH, who he thought was still in Darfur.


19.  He said that his father had owned a plot  of  land  on  which  he  grew
       vegetables among other plots.   Because  of  his  young  age  he  had
       himself not worked on the land.  He had attended a  religious  school
       and only went to the farm  to  play.   He  would  play  football  and
       "billi" (marbles).  The plot of land had been taken by the Janjaweed.


20.  His brother HMHH was older than he  by  about  four  years.   HMHH  had
       helped his father on the land and would  also  help  him  with  basic
       arithmetic.  He said that he had had a friend, ZH, who  came  from  a
       town called Muhagria, which was close to Khutum, whom he had recently
       met in Birmingham.  ZH had been a friend of his older brother.


21.  He referred to the religious school in Khutum where he had been  taught
       Arabic and basic maths and where the pupils had to memorise  part  of
       the Qu'ran.  He said that he had managed to memorise the  Qu'ran  and
       that the Imam had liked him.


22.  With regard to how he knew his date of birth he said that while he  was
       at the religious school the Imam, whom he called  "the  sheikh",  had
       asked him what his date of birth was.  He had not known  and  so  had
       asked his mother, who had said that he was 12.  He had also asked his
       father, who had told him that his date of birth was 15 December  1997
       and had written this down on a piece of paper in Arabic and told  him
       to memorise that date.  He had shown the  paper  to  the  sheikh  the
       following day.


23.  He had been at school when he had been told  that  his  home  had  been
       attacked by the Janjaweed and his father,  uncle,  mother  and  elder
       brother had been killed.  He and his cousin, M, had left  Khutum  and
       gone to various  refugee  camps  in  none  of  which  they  had  been
       registered.  Eventually they went to a camp in the city of  Al-Fashir
       where they remained for about a week and were given clothes and food.
        He said that he was registered with his photograph,  his  name,  his
       father's name, his hometown and date of birth, which he had given  as
       15 December 1997.


24.  They later moved to Kufra in  Libya  where  they  had  remained  for  a
       month.


25.  They had then moved on to Tripoli in Libya where they had  stayed  with
       others from Darfur.  They stayed in Tripoli for six to  eight  months
       before leaving because the  Libyans  would  attack  those  with  dark
       skins.  He and M had then gone to Greece where he said they had  been
       arrested and put in prison for two months and given notice  to  leave
       the country in ten days.  He went with M to Athens and stayed  in  an
       abandoned factory.  M had  earned  a  small  amount  of  money.   The
       claimant had done one day's work stacking boxes but  no  other  work.
       They had begged for food or scavenged food from rubbish bins.


26.  He said that he had been picked up by police, taken in  a  car  to  the
       yard of a building where acid had been poured on his arms as had  hot
       coals.  He had been kicked and slapped and then  thrown  out  on  the
       street.


27.  M had arranged for an agent to take them by lorry to  Italy  which  had
       taken a day on a ferry, sitting on the axles.  They had arrived at  a
       port and the lorry had driven on for  about  four  hours  before,  in
       another town, they had gone to the train station where they had taken
       a train to Ventimiglia.  There they had slept at  the  train  station
       before being taken to the police station where  they  were  kept  for
       about six or seven days.  There was no interpreter - a  Tunisian  man
       who spoke Italian was being used as an informal interpreter but  they
       had difficulties understanding him.  He said that each of  the  group
       was fingerprinted.  He had not given any name, nationality or date of
       birth other than his own details.


28.  He then referred to his interview with the Home Office stating that  he
       could not understand the interpreter.  However, he said that  he  had
       understood the Sudanese and Lebanese women who had  interpreted  when
       he had been interviewed at Croydon for the age assessment on 25 April
       and 13 May 2013.


29.  He referred to the interview in Croydon on 19 June.   He  said  he  was
       told that the foster carer had said he was an adult and was told that
       his name was Abdraman Zene Moussa Issakha.  He said that he was given
       no chance to tell those who interviewed him about mistakes  that  the
       foster carer might have made and that he had not had  the  chance  to
       explain himself to the social workers.  He said they had already made
       up their mind.


30.  He referred to a comment from the looked after child  review  where  it
       was asserted that he had said that he would like help in tracing  his
       family.  He said that he had  not  asked  for  help  in  tracing  his
       father, mother and brother  as  they  were  dead  and  he  could  not
       understand why the reviewing officer, Liston Williams, had said that.


31.  He said he  had  only  met  Amber  Constable  once  and  there  was  no
       interpreter there and that his foster carer,  Mrs  Weldegebriel,  had
       tried to interpret but her Arabic  was  poor.   Amber  Constable  had
       asked him if he smoked or took drugs and he had said that he did not.
        He had asked if he could have more  pocket  money  to  cover  travel
       expenses because he was only getting �10 a  week  and  that  was  not
       enough.  He was given an Oyster Card for 11 to 15 year olds  an  hour
       before he left the foster placement.


32.  He denied the assertions made by Ms Constable that  he  had  asked  her
       about arranging a driving licence and had  said  that  the  fostering
       allowance should  be  paid  to  him  directly  and  that  he  was  an
       accomplished smoker.


33.  He also denied that  he  had  been  moved  by  Mrs  Weldegebriel  to  a
       downstairs bedroom and said that he had got on well with  his  foster
       carer's two children and the other boys being fostered there.


34.  He said that Susan Akingbeme had visited twice at the placement and  he
       had seen her once at the Council's offices and that he had  told  her
       that all his family had been killed apart from his  younger  brother.
       He denied that he could look after himself and said  that  his  house
       mate did all the cooking.


35.  In his oral evidence, when asked about his date of birth  the  claimant
       repeated what had been stated in his statement. He described his home
       and then spoke of meeting with Amber Constable and  Susan  Akingbeme.
       He said his parents and elder brother had been killed on  9  February
       2010.  He denied  that he had said that he would like to contact  his
       family: obviously he could not do so because they were dead.  He  had
       certainly not discussed the Red Cross tracing service.


36.  It was his brother who had  taught  him  to  read  as  his  father  was
       illiterate.  He said there was no system of birth  certificates  that
       he was aware of or any official place to register a  birth  in  South
       Sudan.


37.  His parents had not said that he  could  not  be  registered  and  when
       asked if the transcript of his interview was wrong he said  that  his
       parents were dead.


38.  When asked about the ability  of  his  father  to  read  and  write  he
       replied that his brother could do so.


39.  He confirmed that he had not celebrated birthdays and said that it  was
       his brother HMHH who would have told him that he was 4 years  younger
       than him.


40.  He confirmed that his education in Sudan had been at the  local  mosque
       and said that the students had started there from age 8 or perhaps 9.


41.  It was put to him that Peter Verney had said that children would  start
       going to religious school at 5 and he said that children would  start
       going to pray at the mosque at the age of 5 and at 8 they would start
       to read and memorise the Qu'ran.  It was put to him that he had  said
       that he had been told his age when he was 12 but he was now  changing
       that to say that he had been told when he was 9.  He repeated that he
       had been told his age was 12.


42.  Asked when he had left Sudan he said he had left in the first month  of
       2011.  When it was put to him that he had said at  interview  at  the
       Home Office that he had left in 2012 he stated that  the  interpreter
       must have made a mistake.


43.  Asked how long he had remained in Darfur after  his  parents  had  been
       killed he said that after they had  been  killed  he  had  gone  from
       Khutum to Al-Fashir and then to Nyala and another camp before  ending
       up at Kufra in Libya - he travelled with his cousin.  He thought that
       his cousin had been in his 20s.


44.  He was then asked if he had been to the refugee camp  in  Nyala  (which
       he had just mentioned) and he stated that he had not  mentioned  that
       camp when interviewed because he had not been asked.  It was  put  to
       him that he was trying to add to the length of  his  journey  and  he
       said that that was not the case.  He was then asked how long  he  had
       been in Tripoli and he said that he had been there between  four  and
       eight months, he could not recall the season when he had arrived  but
       it was the start of the war against Gaddafi and they were  unable  to
       go out.


45.  He could not remember when they had  gone  to  Patras  in  Greece.   He
       could not remember observing Ramadan either in Tripoli or Greece  but
       said that he had arrived in Greece at  the  end  of  August  2011  or
       possibly in September or October that year.


46.  Everyone on the boat had been detained in Greece and  he  thought  that
       he  had  been  fingerprinted  there.   They  were   in   Greece   for
       approximately one year six months or one year eight months.  They had
       left Greece after a Sudanese man had been hit by a  police  car.   He
       did not know the month they had entered Italy in 2013 but he had been
       there for two weeks before he came to Britain.


47.  He confirmed that he had been picked up by the  police  in  Ventimiglia
       where they had arrived at midnight and that he had been detained  for
       six days or a week.  It was put to him that he had  told  the  social
       worker that he had stayed for three days and  that  he  had  told  Dr
       Verney that he had been detained for four or five days.  He said that
       he had not been asked by Susan Akingbeme about his time in Italy.  He
       had been fingerprinted in Greece and he said  that  his  fingerprints
       had been taken there.


48.  It was put to him that he had not said that he had  been  fingerprinted
       in Italy until he was told that a match had been found.   He  replied
       that when he had been picked up in Italy a Tunisian  man  had  spoken
       for those that were in the group.


49.  He confirmed that he had not wanted to be  separated  from  his  cousin
       but denied that as his cousin had said he was an adult he had  wanted
       to be treated as an adult as he had not wanted to be  separated  from
       his cousin.  He said  that  he  was  given  a  form  by  the  Italian
       authorities and left straight away.


50.  When he had arrived in Britain he had met an  Algerian  who  had  taken
       him to the Home Office.


51.  He stated that he had been put into bed and breakfast accommodation  by
       Croydon after he had claimed asylum and denied that he  had  spent  a
       night with another foster carer.


52.  He confirmed that he had been taken to the Refugee Council and that  he
       had been registered there and that they had helped him.  No-one there
       had been surprised that he was in foster care.  He said that  he  had
       never asked about a driving licence and he said that he had only  met
       Amber Constable on one occasion.  He denied that  he  had  asked  for
       extra money or that he had ever smoked.


53.  Mr Hadden then returned to the issue of the age of his brother and  put
       to him that at his interview with the Home Office he  had  said  that
       his brother was 21 and not 16 or 17 and also  that  his  brother  was
       four years or so older than he.  The claimant  did  not  accept  that
       given that he had said that his brother had been killed  in  November
       2010 when he had claimed to be 12 his brother would only have been 16
       of possibly 17 when he had died.


54.  In re-examination he was asked about his feelings when interviewed  and
       whether or not he had been scared.


55.  He said that in Sudan if you gave your age it  would  be  your  age  at
       your next birthday.  He said that he had referred to his  brother  as
       being four years older than he as if he were living.  He said that he
       had not understood what was going on at the LAC review.


56.  With regard to the first age assessment he confirmed that  he  had  not
       been told by the assessors that he was not telling the truth.


57.  Over the first three days of  hearing  information  came  in  from  the
       third country unit of the Home Office regarding the fingerprint match
       of the man who had claimed asylum in Italy.  When that was put to the
       claimant he denied that he had ever used the name  of  Abdraman  Zene
       Moussa Issakha (AZMI) or a date of birth of 1 January 1994 let  alone
       1984 (the date of birth first recorded for AZMI).


58.  He said that he was not from Chad and that he had then gone  to  Greece
       before leaving for Italy and that he had entered Italy on a ship - he
       had never arrived in Rome by  plane.   He  described  again  how  his
       fingerprints were taken in Ventimiglia.


Evidence of Elizabeth Bell


59.  Ms Bell's evidence was taken first, by Skype because she was due to  go
       on holiday on the afternoon of the first day  of  the  hearing.   She
       confirmed her statement stating that she had known the claimant since
       January 2014 and that she had worked with young  refugees  for  seven
       years at My-Place.  She said that the average age of the young people
       with whom she worked was 18 and almost all were young  teenagers  who
       are or were unaccompanied minors.  She  described  the  weekly  youth
       clubs and advice and support services which  My-Place  offered.   She
       confirmed that she also was the project coordinator for BIRCH.


60.  She stated that the claimant had  been  referred  to  My-Place  by  the
       refugee youth project in Croydon  and  that  the  referral  form  had
       stated that he felt scared of the men he lived with because "they are
       adults and do adult things, and I am not".


61.  She said that she had had difficulty  in  engaging  with  the  claimant
       first but had been told by the refugee  youth  project  that  he  was
       having difficulty adapting to life in Birmingham.  He  had  found  it
       very hard to orientate to a new city.


62.  She described the claimant as having  a  serious  demeanour  and  being
       very nervous and that he had struggled to trust her.   She  suspected
       from his body language that he was someone who had suffered  and  was
       struggling to cope without  the  support  of  his  family  or  Social
       Services.


63.  She said she had referred him to BIRCH and then spoke of  what  he  had
       told her about his past in Sudan and the violence from the Janjewed.


64.  She had never had cause to question the claimant's  age  and  she  said
       that his appearance was very much in line with his claimed age of  16
       years old (her statement was dated 19 December 2014).  She said  that
       his height, build and facial features were in line  with  his  stated
       age and he had always come across as a young person  who  was  trying
       his best to cope but struggling.  She had found a place for him on an
       ESOL young learners course for 16 to 18 year olds. He  had  told  her
       how much he loved that course because he was being taught with  other
       young people.  She said that she would see him at a youth  club  each
       week and that he had  support  from  a  volunteer  family  and  other
       support in place which had made a difference.


65.  She concluded her statement by stating:


           "There was nothing at all in C's  behaviour  which  suggests  he
           might be older than 16.  There is nothing about him which  would
           mark him out to be very different (i.e. older) to the  other  16
           year old teenage boys who attend the Birmingham youth  club  and
           whom I have supported".


66.  In her oral evidence she said that she  would  see  the  claimant  once
      every one or two weeks and she had seen  him  the  previous  Thursday.
      The youth club sessions would be for two and  a  half  hours  and  she
      would also see him when he came in for counselling. She described  him
      as being wary of adults initially but  had  slowly  been  gaining  the
      confidence to interact: he realised that she wanted the best for  him.
      She described him as quite emotional.


67.  There were a number of volunteer and  paid  workers  and  the  children
       looked after were from an age range of between 13 to 21 or 12 to  22.
       BIRCH dealt with children between 16 and 25 and most were under 20.


68.  Asked if she had developed any ability to assess age she said that  age
       was very difficult but working with a group it was possible to get  a
       sense  of  an  individual's  age  by  comparing  body  language   and
       confidence and so on.  She  confirmed  that  she  believed  that  the
       claimant was the age he said he was and that she  had  no  reason  to
       question it.


69.  In cross-examination she confirmed that she had always wanted  to  work
       with those who were disadvantaged and she agreed with Mr Hadden  that
       she would be highly sympathetic.


70.  She said that the average age in the youth club would be under  18  and
       she knew that the claimant was aware that his age was disputed.   She
       stated that there was no evidence that the claimant had  ever  smoked
       and she was surprised at that suggestion.   She  accepted  of  course
       that appearance could not be  determinative  and  that  the  claimant
       could be as old as 19� or 20 years old now.


71.  It was put to her that she seemed very surprised that the age had  been
       disputed and she was  asked  if  she  was  aware  that  it  had  been
       questioned by two foster carers and social workers.   She  said  that
       she was not surprised by what the social workers would have said  but
       was surprised at the remarks of the foster carers  and  that  it  had
       been thought necessary to rearrange where he was sleeping.   She  had
       known other asylum seekers who had given false details  en  route  to
       Britain.


Evidence of Helen Johnson


72.  Helen Johnson is an Operations Manager at  the  children's  section  of
       the Refugee Council in Croydon and has worked at the Refugee  Council
       for seventeen years.  In her evidence she  referred  to  a  statement
       which  had  been  drafted  to  answer  an  assertion  made   by   Mrs
       Weldegebriel that when she had taken  the  claimant  to  the  Refugee
       Council someone there had stated that the claimant had been  laughing
       about managing to get into care when he was older than he claimed  to
       be.  She said that she found it incredible that a worker or volunteer
       at the Refugee Council would make a statement to a  foster  carer  on
       first meeting her that a child in her care had said that he was older
       than he claimed to be or that he had "managed to get  into  care"  as
       that would be totally unprofessional and inconsistent with  the  type
       of work that they did.  If she had believed the  claimant  to  be  an
       adult the Refugee Council would not be supporting his claim to  be  a
       child.


73.  In her oral evidence she spoke of the database kept  of  the  volunteer
       and other workers at the Refugee Council and stated that if she  knew
       exactly when Mrs Weldegebriel had taken the claimant to  the  Refugee
       Council she might be able to trace who Mrs Weldegebriel had spoken to
       but as it was she could not find any record of any meeting.  Normally
       it was a case that foster carers would merely drop off the applicant.
        With regard to the claimant's age she said that  she  supported  her
       colleagues who thought that the claimant was  a  child.   She  stated
       that if it was thought that the claimant was an adult he  would  have
       been given help as an adult.  If it was thought that an asylum seeker
       should no longer be helped the Refugee Council would not  notify  the
       local authority.


74.  She stated that having seen the claimant interact with  other  children
       and engaging with them she considered that he was a child.


Evidence of Mrs Mandy Ross


75.  Mrs Ross met the claimant through BIRCH.  She has a 15  year  old  son,
       Joe, who is an only child.   In  her  statement  she  said  that  the
       claimant was first brought to her house in March 2014 and has visited
       roughly once a week since then.  She stated  that  her  son  and  the
       claimant get on well together and that the claimant would come to her
       house on Monday evenings after college  arriving  between  5  and  6.
       They would eat together and then the  claimant  and  Joe  would  play
       games such as jenga, dominoes and mancala "and have lots of fun". She
       stated that she did not believe that the claimant was able to do  any
       cooking and that she had been teaching him and  Joe  to  cook  simple
       dishes.  She had tried to explain to the claimant that he should  not
       eat fast food all the time.  Whenever she cooked she would  give  him
       leftovers and a bag of food to take away.


76.  She said that she had taken the  claimant  with  Joe  on  family  trips
       where they had climbed trees and eaten ice-cream and  played  on  the
       beach together.  She said that they had organised an Eid party with a
       few of the BIRCH families and the children had all  been  around  the
       same age.  Indeed she stated that the claimant had come to her  house
       to celebrate his 17th  birthday  with  them  the  previous  day  (her
       statement was signed  on  16  December  2014).   She  said  that  the
       claimant would play football and basketball with his friends and that
       his English was slowly improving and that he appeared to need to  ask
       for advice and assurance on matters such as his weight.


77.  She did  not  understand  why  Croydon  Council  was  saying  that  the
       claimant was not 16.  She had been a part of  the  family  befriender
       project for over ten months and she knew  the  claimant  quite  well:
       there was nothing in his behaviour that suggested that  he  might  be
       older than 16.


78.   In  her  oral  evidence  she  said  that  he  was  the  second   young
       unaccompanied minor she had dealt with - the  relationship  with  the
       first had not really worked out but the claimant and Joe got on well.
        It appeared they were boys together.  She said that she had not been
       told that he might be older.  She confirmed that her  experience  was
       that he had not cooked before.  He received the care that  she  would
       offer as a child.


79.  She said that he had spoken to her about his  journey  to  Britain  and
       that he had been badly treated in Greece.  He had not said much about
       Italy.  To her he seemed like a typical teenager.


80.  He had spoken to her about his family and she  knew  that  his  parents
       and his brother were dead.  He  had  shed  tears  about  his  younger
       brother who she thought was about 6 years old.


Evidence of Mohammed Ayub


81.  Mohammed Ayub is the Pakistani asylum seeker  with  whom  the  claimant
       lived in Birmingham. He has now been granted refugee status.


82.  In his statement and in his evidence  he  said  that  he  had  children
       whose age ranged from 6 to 16 - he had last  seen  his  children  two
       years ago.


83.  When the claimant had come to live with him in  Birmingham  in  October
       2013 he had shared a three bedroom flat with him and another  person.
       Although he thought the claimant looked quite tall when he first  met
       him he noted that he had barely any facial hair and he did not  think
       that he was shaving.  He had never seen any shaving equipment in  the
       communal bathroom.  He stated that there were no obvious  signs  that
       the claimant looked like an older person although he realised it  was
       very difficult to gauge the age of a person by their appearance.


84.  He described the claimant as having  very  poor  self-care  skills  and
       said that he could not cook, his room was a mess  and  his  budgeting
       skills were poor.  He stated that the claimant needed guidance  about
       how to behave in the house which he was  sharing  with  other  people
       including being told to clean up after himself.  On one occasion when
       he had done this the claimant had become tearful and had reacted in a
       way that was not very mature.  When he had needed  to  rest  after  a
       knee operation he had asked the claimant to  shop  for  him  but  the
       claimant seemed to often buy the wrong quantity  of  goods.   He  had
       never seen the claimant smoke.


85.  In his oral evidence he stated that he  had  stopped  living  with  the
       claimant in August 2014, having lived with him for approximately  ten
       months.  As neither of them had been  working  they  would  see  each
       other three times a day at mealtimes.  They had lived together almost
       like a family.


86.  He confirmed that he had children the  oldest  of  which  was  16.   He
       described the claimant's behaviour as childish and said that his  own
       children had a better  understanding  of  domestic  matters  such  as
       buying groceries, hygiene and keeping their bedrooms tidy.   He  said
       that he had told the claimant to keep his room clean and stated  that
       the claimant could not cook although he would make tea.  Although the
       claimant had said that he could do small things it was clear that  he
       could not do  anything  difficult.   He  confirmed  he  had  seen  no
       evidence of the claimant shaving.  He considered  that  the  claimant
       was honest, saying that he had given him change  back  after  he  had
       been to the shops.


87.  In cross-examination he said that he had not seen  the  claimant  since
       August 2014 and he expressed surprise that  Croydon  considered  that
       the claimant was an adult: it was his opinion that the claimant was a
       child.  Mr Hadden asked  him  if  he  accepted  that  the  claimant's
       appearance was someone aged 18� and he answered that it would not  be
       right to say that the claimant could be older.  Mr Ayub  Khan  stated
       that he believed that the claimant's poor self-care skills,  and  his
       lack of ability to cook or budget indicated  the  claimant's  younger
       age rather than,  for  example,  someone  who  was  about  to  go  to
       university.  He accepted that the claimant would  not  have  had  the
       chance to develop his skills while he had been  travelling.  He  said
       that they would eat together.  During the rest of the day  when  they
       were not eating the  claimant  would  stay  at  home.   He  described
       showing the claimant how to use buses and to make his own way to  his
       lawyers in London.  He had given him a map and said that he would try
       to keep track of him on his phone.


Evidence of Zakaria Hamed


88.  Zakaria Hamed relied on a statement in which he stated that  he  was  a
       family friend of the claimant and was aged 21.  He  was  born  on  18
       January 1993.  His hometown was Mahagria in Darfur.  He said that  he
       knew his date of birth because he  used  to  have  a  Sudanese  birth
       certificate which had been issued by the Nyala  Hospital  immediately
       after his birth.  He went  on  to  say  that  he  thought  the  birth
       certificate had recorded his date of birth according to  the  Islamic
       calendar but he could not remember what the date was as in  the  area
       he came from in Sudan birthdays were not generally celebrated  as  it
       was not part of their culture and tradition.  He had left  the  birth
       certificate in Libya where he had lived between 2008 and 2010.


89.  The Home Office had said that he had claimed asylum in other  countries
       in Europe en route to Britain but in October 2013  had  been  granted
       discretionary leave to remain for five years.


90.  He said that his father had owned a small plot of land in Khutum  where
       he would work from time to time.  He had  met  the  claimant's  elder
       brother HMHH in Khutum because his family's plot of land was  in  the
       same area as theirs.  HMHH had been around the same age  as  he.   He
       had not asked HMHH his age but his father  had  told  him  they  were
       about the same age.  HMHH had been a good friend of his  and  on  two
       occasions he had slept in HMHH's family home where  he  had  met  the
       claimant but the claimant had not socialised with them because he was
       too young.  He said that the claimant and his friends were  obviously
       much younger than him and HMHH.


91.  He said that the claimant had not worked on his father's  farm  because
       he was too young.   Instead  he  went  to  the  khalwa,  which  is  a
       religious school where they would learn the Qu'ran and Arabic.   HMHH
       would go to khalwa in the afternoon having helped his father  in  the
       morning.  He said that he had left Sudan in 2008  and  believed  that
       most of his family members had been killed.  He had  learnt  about  a
       party for Sudanese people in Birmingham, had gone there and  met  the
       claimant.  He was sure that the claimant was "significantly"  younger
       than he.


92.  In his oral evidence he said that he would occasionally  speak  to  the
       claimant by telephone - he had not seen him for about  eight  months.
       He had not known the claimant's younger brother but  only  the  other
       members of the family.  He described some areas of  Khutum  and  said
       that he had only spent some time there one year.  When asked how  old
       he was when he had gone to Khutum he said he could not say his age or
       date of birth as in Sudan attention was rarely paid to age.


93.  He stated that nobody had asked how old he was when he had gone to  the
       khalwa and he had not asked his parents.  All he knew was he had gone
       to the khalwa when he was young  and  had  stopped  going  after  the
       problems started in 2008.  He had only really known HMHH for a  short
       time.


94.  He did not know the name of the Imam at the khalwa in Khutum.   It  was
       put to him that the claimant was thought to be about his age  but  he
       asserted that the claimant was younger.


Evidence of II


95.  Given the age of II Mr Hadden, Mr Suterwalla, the  interpreter  and  I,
       sat around a table at the back of the courtroom with him.  I excluded
       everyone else. In his witness statement he said that he had been born
       in Khutum and had left Sudan in 2013, coming to Britain with a  group
       of friends and claiming asylum on arrival.


96.  He said that he was born in the ninth month of the Islamic  calendar  -
       the month of Ramadan - and each time Ramadan came around he  knew  he
       was one year older.  He knew when he arrived in Britain that  he  was
       15 years old and said that the Home Office were correct in  assigning
       him the date of birth of 1 July 1997.


97.  He said that he had known the claimant for  a  long  time,  since  they
       were children as they  both  came  from  the  same  neighbourhood  in
       Khutum.  He had met the claimant in religious school when  they  were
       both 7 or 8 years old.  He had no reason to suspect that the claimant
       was older than he.  They would go  to  the  religious  school  almost
       every and they were in the same class most of the time.  He  did  not
       remember when he last saw the claimant in Khutum.  He  said  that  he
       and the claimant had met at  the  Refugee  Council  when  he  was  in
       Croydon and when the claimant  was  in  the  Home  Office  hostel  in
       Croydon he would visit him each day.  He said that the  claimant  was
       very scared of living with adults.


98.  In his oral evidence he confirmed that  he  had  not  been  interviewed
       face to face when he had given his statement but had merely  received
       a phone call from the claimant's solicitors.  He said that he and the
       claimant had gone to the  religious  school  together  as  they  were
       appropriately the same age - 6 or 7.  His mother had told him that he
       was one year older each Ramadan.  He thought that he  had  last  been
       told by his mother that he was 13 or 14.


99.  He said that the sheikh at the religious school had asked him  for  his
       age but he did not know why and said that there was a note in a book.
        The claimant had left Sudan some time before him.


100. With regard to the religious school  in  K  he  said  that  there  were
       twenty to 25 pupils in each of  three  circles  which  were  arranged
       according to age.  There was a group for  the  youngest  children,  a
       circle for those slightly older such as him and the claimant and  one
       for the oldest pupils.  He believed that the claimant was his age and
       certainly he was not four years older.  He said that the claimant had
       been unhappy when he had been moved from the foster carer's house and
       that he had not been treated well when he had moved.


101. He was asked if he had any chance to understand  what  was  written  in
       the statement before he signed it and he said he had not and that  he
       had spoken on the telephone to the claimant's solicitor, who had then
       sent the statement to his home address.


102. Mr Hadden asked him if he had been troubled about giving  evidence  and
       he  said  that  the  social  worker  had  said  that  the  claimant's
       solicitors should have spoken  to  the  social  worker  first  before
       speaking directly to him.  The claimant's representative had not told
       him that he should take advice before speaking to her.  He went on to
       say that he believed that HMHH was four or five years older  than  he
       and the claimant.  Asked why the claimant would have said that he had
       started at the religious school at the age of 9, he  stated  that  he
       believed that they had started when they were 6  or  7  but  that  in
       Sudan age was not used that much.  He said that some  of  the  oldest
       children in the khalwa were in their 20s.  That age range would start
       at 17 or 18.  The middle circle he had been in when he left  was  for
       those of 8, 9 or 10.  He had joined it possibly at the age  of  9  or
       10.  It was his recollection that the claimant had gone to  religious
       school with him every day.  He said they were approximately 10 or  11
       when the claimant had left and he had then been in the middle circle.


103. He went on to say that it had taken him five or six  months  to  travel
       from Khutum to Britain.


Statement of Francesco Jeff


104. There was in  the  bundle  a  statement  dated  21  August  2013,  from
       Francesco Jeff, the claimant's litigation friend, who  did  not  give
       evidence.  He stated that the claimant was living rough and  that  he
       required emotional support.  Mr Jeff  had worked  with  age  disputed
       minors for six years and he "strongly" believed that the claimant was
       a minor: he had reached that  conclusion  from  his  experience,  the
       claimant's demeanour and his appearance.


Evidence of Mrs Tsega Weldegebriel


105. Mrs Weldegebriel was the claimant's foster carer between  13  May  2013
       and 19 June 2013.  In her witness statement she stated that  she  had
       been acting as a foster carer since 2007 looking after  young  people
       from a number of countries including Afghanistan, Eritrea, Sri Lanka,
       Sudan, Albania and Kosovo.  In all she had cared for over nine  young
       people and most of her placements had lasted  on  average  for  three
       years.  She also would offer respite care and out of hours  emergency
       care.  She said that her first impression of the claimant was that he
       looked much older than the age that he claimed to be and that she had
       felt uncomfortable around him.  When she took him to the GP,  or  the
       shopping centre, she would always get comments that he was much older
       and that he looked too old to be a foster child.  When she had  taken
       him to the Refugee Council she had spoken to someone who had told her
       that the claimant had been coming there for the last three months and
       that the claimant had told him that he was  older  than  the  age  he
       claimed to be and laughed about managing to get into care.   She  had
       been told that he was a new arrival and this was  clearly  not  true.
       She went on to say that he did everything for himself and by  himself
       and she did not have to  show  him  very  much  in  the  house.   She
       believed that he was more responsible and mature for his claimed  age
       compared to other young people that she had fostered over  the  years
       and that she had not felt right having him in her home.


106. In her oral evidence she said that  not  only  did  the  claimant  look
       older than his claimed age but also that he  smoked.   She  was  sure
       that he smoked outside in the garden and when she came in  she  could
       smell it.  She said that she believed that he smoked every day.   She
       was referred to the document at tab 8.56 which was headed "notes from
       Tsega diary and mobile phone".  She said that she did  not  have  the
       handwritten notes from which those notes would have been taken as the
       folder in which they had been placed had been handed  to  the  social
       worker.  Asked if it was an accurate reflection of what had  been  in
       her notes she said that she thought it was.


107. She was asked about the visit at the Refugee Council and she  described
       sitting down and seeing a woman and two men behind the  screen.   One
       of them had said that the claimant had been coming there  for  months
       but she was not sure who had said that the claimant had said that  he
       was older.  She emphasised that she was not  happy  having  an  older
       person in her house.  It was her job to look  after  children  rather
       than adults.  Because of her concerns about his age she had moved the
       claimant to a ground floor bedroom.


108. She was asked about the statement from TS and  she  said  that  he  had
       told her and the social worker that he had never made a statement and
       that his signature had been faked.


109. She was asked about the claimant asking for money  and  she  said  that
       the pocket money which she had given him was not enough for  him  but
       he had never said what he wanted it for.  She felt that  he  appeared
       very knowledgeable for a 15 year old and was very independent.


110. She added that she believed that the claimant  could  cook  a  Sudanese
       dish.  She was asked what age she thought the claimant  was  now  and
       she replied merely  that  he  looked  older  than  his  claimed  age,
       indicating that she thought he might be more than 30.


111. With regard to the record of events while the  claimant  was  with  her
       she said that the notes had been typed up by Ms  Constable  and  that
       they had worked together.


112. She was asked if Ms Constable had checked her diary and she  said  that
       Ms Constable had checked it all the time.   She  could  not  actually
       remember how the diary had been prepared but usually it was typed  up
       from long-hand notes.  She was not sure, however, whether or not  the
       notes at tab 8 had been typed up by her or Ms Constable.


113. She then indicated that there were in fact two diaries,  one  would  be
       for notes relating to dental and doctor's appointments and the  other
       relating to matters which were confidential.


114. She said that she would have felt safer had  she  been  told  that  the
       claimant was not newly arrived in the country when she  took  him  in
       and that therefore she would have been less shocked when she went  to
       the Refugee Council and found that he was known there.


115. Asked if she had seen the claimant smoking she said that  she  did  not
       need to see him - it was only when he came into the  house  that  she
       believed that he had been smoking outside  as  she  could  smell  the
       smoke.  She said  that  the  smoking  was  nothing  to  do  with  the
       claimant's age but she was sure that that was what he was  doing.   A
       newly arrived child would not be as knowledgeable or confident as the
       claimant.


116. She confirmed that she had spoken to Ms Susan Akingbeme  regarding  her
       concerns about the claimant's age and stated that she had  moved  the
       claimant without the consent of Ms  Akingbeme.   She  said,  however,
       that  she  could  not  do  anything  without  the   social   worker's
       permission.


117. She referred to a meeting with Ms Constable when she said that  another
       boy living in the house, Mehane had interpreted.


118. Asked why Ms Constable  would  have  said  that  the  claimant  was  an
       accomplished smoker she said she did not know  but  perhaps  she  had
       been told by other children.


119. She was again asked why the notes stated that the claimant's  behaviour
       towards other children was one of irritated tolerance and she replied
       that that was probably something that the social worker had been told
       by other children.


Evidence of Adetunji Oyeleye


120. Mr Oyeleye is an advanced social worker  employed  by  Croydon  in  the
       children looked after, permanence service 1.   In  his  statement  he
       said that he had almost ten years' UK  post-qualification  experience
       of working with children and  families  including  five  and  a  half
       years' experience in the children looked after,  family  support  and
       child protection team as well as four and a  half  years'  experience
       with unaccompanied asylum seeking-children.   He  said  that  he  had
       taken part in the age assessment on 25 April  2013  as  part  of  his
       duties and that he had been conducting age assessments since 15 March
       2010 - on average two each month.  About 40% of the assessment duties
       conducted were on young persons from Sudan or Somalia.  He  conducted
       the assessment with a colleague, Ken Facey.  It was  a  full  "Merton
       compliant"  assessment  in  which  they  were  guided  by  their  own
       knowledge of child development and experience of working  with  young
       people of the same or a similar ethnic background.  He said  that  at
       the first assessment the claimant was given the benefit of the  doubt
       as his appearance, presentation and demeanour during interview  might
       not have given sufficient  evidence  to  draw  a  logical  conclusion
       regarding his age.  His approach had, however, been holistic and  the
       decision was made in the absence of any material evidence.   He  said
       that he was of  the  view  that  the  claimant  could  have  suffered
       physical and emotional neglect following the death of his father that
       might have explained why his physical appearance  suggested  to  them
       that he was older than his claimed age.


121. It was sometimes the case that assessments  had  to  be  reviewed  when
       other information came to light.  In this case new evidence had  come
       from UKBA on 31 May and therefore the decision had been reviewed.  On
       19 June 2013 he and Mr Facey had met with the claimant at the  review
       age assessment.  He said that the claimant was given  an  opportunity
       to respond to new evidence which they  had  received  from  UKBA  and
       during that meeting the claimant had confirmed that he  had  spent  a
       brief period of time in Italy.  He had considered that  the  evidence
       given by the claimant was inconsistent and that therefore there  were
       issues regarding the claimant's credibility and that the  information
       which they had regarding the claimant's journey to Britain undermined
       the veracity of the claimant's  account  during  the  age  assessment
       interview and suggested he was not the age he claimed to be.  In  the
       statement he went on to  say  that  before  arriving  at  conclusions
       following the review he  and  Ken  Facey  had  consulted  with  other
       professionals who had been involved with the claimant  and  took  the
       views of the claimant's allocated social  worker  and  had  read  the
       independent reviewing officer's report of 5 June.  On 18 June 2013 he
       was informed by Susan Akingbeme that her impression of  the  claimant
       was that he was not a child but an adult.  It  was  that  information
       together with the minutes of the LAC chair review report  written  by
       Liston Williams which said that "the chair would support another  age
       assessment which would culminate in the claimant's  transfer  to  the
       adult services as soon as possible" that had lead to the review - the
       manager, Cynthia Winifred, had made that decision because of the  new
       information.  He said on 19 June he  and  Ken  Facey  had  given  the
       claimant the opportunity to respond to the views of his social worker
       and those expressed by Liston Williams in his  report  and  that  the
       claimant had maintained that he was 15 years old.  However, they  had
       concluded that the claimant was over 18.


122. In his oral evidence he  said  that  an  Arabic  interpreter  had  been
       present at the age assessment on 19 June - the claimant had  been  on
       his own.


123. Since the review he said that he had seen the claimant on one  occasion
       outside the NASS accommodation when he had been  with  another  young
       man.  Having seen the claimant the day before  he did not think  that
       he had changed physically since he had seen him two years before.


124. It was put to him that the claimant's views should have been sought  on
       the reasons for the review  and he stated that  they  needed  to  get
       information from the claimant promptly and that the  interpreter  had
       said that he had understood the questions being asked.


125. He emphasised that  he  thought  that  he  was  good  at  his  job  and
       described the age assessment as a complex process.  He  described  Mr
       Facey as being of assistance as they  were  both  experienced  social
       workers and that in the original age assessment they had been  trying
       to say that they did not consider that the claimant was 15  but  they
       had given him the benefit of the doubt.  However, they had been able,
       in the initial  assessment,  to  address  their  concerns  about  his
       physical appearance. There were  no  other  factors  which  concerned
       them.  They had reached their conclusions feeling that their concerns
       regarding the claimant's physical appearance had been  addressed  and
       that therefore they had stated the age  range  of  15  to  17.   They
       accepted that testing the honesty  of  a  claimant  was  one  of  the
       factors they should have taken into account when dealing with the age
       assessment.


126. He referred to the handwritten note taken by Ron  Braeger  at  the  age
       assessment and accepted that  neither  he  nor  Mr  Facey  had  asked
       questions about how the claimant's parents would have known his  date
       of birth.


127. He accepted that the claimant should have been aware  of  the  concerns
       regarding his age and that that  had  not  been  made  clear  to  the
       claimant.


128. He could not explain why the feedback did not show that  the  views  of
       Susan Akingbeme, the LAC review and Amber Constable  had  been  taken
       into account and stated that  information  regarding  the  claimant's
       requests for money and his smoking had not been taken into account  -
       these were not part of the review.


129. He accepted that there was no appropriate adult present at  the  review
       and stated that that might well  have  been  a  mistake  but  it  was
       because the meeting was informal.  He also accepted that the claimant
       had shown signs of  being  upset  and  shocked  when  told  what  was
       happening.


Evidence of Susan Akingbeme


130. In her witness statement Ms Akingbeme stated  that  she  was  a  senior
       social worker in Croydon permanent service with  a  MSc.   in  social
       work.  She stated that she had been employed by the defendant since 4
       October  2010  and  regularly  conducted  age  assessments  and   had
       undergone  regular  training  organised  by  the  London  Borough  of
       Croydon's legal team.


131. She was the claimant's social worker from 14 May 2013 to 21  June  2013
       and had met the claimant on two occasions.  Firstly on  23  May  2013
       she said she had met him for about one and  a  half  hours  during  a
       statutory visit and on that occasion she said that the  claimant  had
       been provided with an Arabic interpreter.  She had met him again on 5
       June during his LAC review.  During that review the  interpreter  had
       arrived late and prior to the  interpreter  arriving  the  chair  had
       tried to explain the purpose of the meeting to the  claimant  but  it
       was not clear what he understood.  He had not  asked  any  questions.
       She said that her views on the claimant's age had been sought  during
       the age assessment review conducted on 19 June 2013.


132. Prior to her first visit the supervising social worker  telephoned  her
       to express concerns regarding the claimant's age and had  sought  her
       consent to move the claimant to  the  ground  floor  room  so  as  to
       protect the foster carer's 12 year old  daughter  whose  bedroom  had
       been on the same floor as his.  She had therefore  gone  to  see  the
       foster carer to check the position with her.  When she  had  met  the
       claimant she thought he appeared older than 15.  She considered  that
       there was "no youthfulness" in his appearance or demeanour.


133. She described the claimant as "not a very tall individual",  estimating
       his height at not much more than five feet five  inches  but  despite
       that she considered he looked more like an adult than a  child.   She
       also said that he was always polite, calm and pleasant  when  meeting
       with her  and  was  observed  to  behave  maturely.   She  ended  her
       statement by  stating  that  she  believed  that  when  she  was  his
       allocated social worker the claimant was aged 18.


134. In her oral evidence she said that she had last seen the claimant on  5
       June 2013 but having seen him at the hearing he  had  not  grown  but
       perhaps he had put on weight.


135. When referred to the LAC review she confirmed that  age  had  not  been
       discussed but said that she had noted the chair's comments  and  that
       she had raised her concerns about the claimant's age with Mr Adetunji
       before the age assessment review which she described as a  continuing
       process.


136. She said that at the meeting with the claimant she had seen him in  his
       room  for  about  five  or  ten  minutes.   She  confirmed  that  Mrs
       Weldegebriel had stated that she was managing and did  not  need  the
       help of an interpreter.  It was put to her that Mrs Weldegebriel  had
       helped  with  some  interpretation.   She  said  that  she  and   Mrs
       Weldegebriel had been passing information to and fro and had  managed
       to understand the claimant.


137. She was referred to the case notes for 23 May where it  was  said  that
       the claimant was said to be  doing  well  and  that  there  were  "no
       worries, concerns,  complaints  during  the  meeting"  and  that  the
       claimant was told about the basic rules and the boundaries  and  said
       he was happy with them.  The claimant had said that he  was  managing
       well with the �10 pocket money he receives but had run out  of  money
       because he used part of the money to top up  his  Oyster  Card.   The
       carer had said that she was responsible for the Oyster Card and  that
       an application for a free Oyster Card had been completed and it  will
       be taken to the refugee council to get signed.


138. She emphasised that  Mr  Williams  was  independent,  although  he  was
       employed by the council to check what the council was doing, he would
       go against a social worker if appropriate.   She  accepted  that  the
       claimant had been nervous during the LAC review.  She referred  to  a
       further meeting with him when she had  gone  to  the  house  and  had
       passed Ms Constable, who was outside and about  to  drive  away.   On
       that day Mrs Weldegebriel had raised concerns.


139. She went on to say that she had not  seen  the  age  assessment  of  24
       April until after 23 May when she had raised concerns.  When she  had
       met the claimant on 23 May she said that she thought he was  a  "nice
       boy, respectful, not threatening and there was nothing in the meeting
       to show that he was dangerous".  It was put to her that her  view  of
       his age was based  on  two  things,  the  claimant's  looks  and  his
       behaviour.  She said that she had not made the age assessment but she
       had experience of that age group.  Her experience was based  in  part
       on the fact that she had children of her own.  She was pressed on how
       she would assess the claimant's age  but  she  did  not  consider  it
       appropriate to comment, emphasising that her assessment was based  on
       her experience.


140. She stated that she was not  aware  of  where  the  original  documents
       were.  The issue of shaving was put to her and she said that that was
       not a particularly relevant factor.  It was put to her  that  it  was
       not until 19 June that  the  claimant  was  told  that  there  was  a
       decision to review his age but in fact that decision and  indeed  the
       decision that he was an adult had been made  the  previous  day.   Ms
       Akingbeme stated that the issue of age had been  an  ongoing  concern
       raised by the reviewing officer and two foster carers.  It was not  a
       sudden decision.  She was asked what the purpose of the meeting on 19
       June was and she replied that that was something which should be  put
       to Mr Oyeleye.  It was put to her that the procedure was  unfair  and
       she said that this was an  issue  that  should  be  improved  in  the
       future.


Evidence of Ms Amber Constable


141. Ms Amber Constable is the  supervising  social  worker  at  the  London
       Borough of Croydon.  Having graduated with a diploma and a BA  degree
       in social work from Kingston University in  1994  and  1995  she  had
       worked in several children's homes over nine years  before  obtaining
       her qualification as a social worker.  She has  worked  in  all  care
       teams with the exception of leaving care teams.  She is an  ex-foster
       carer caring for asylum seekers and has adult children.


142. She said that she first met the claimant on 17 May 2013  when  visiting
       the foster carer's house.  She was surprised that he  was  considered
       to be 15 and that he was placed in a household with young people much
       younger than he.  She questioned his age with the  foster  carer  and
       asked to see the documents provided by the social worker.   She  said
       that from her experience of working with young  people  the  claimant
       looked much older - at least over 20.  She said that the foster carer
       had stated that at times the young  people  felt  uneasy  around  the
       claimant both of whom had raised concerns about the claimant and were
       happy when told that he was to  be  moving  downstairs.   The  foster
       carer's own children, who were aged 12 and 10, were also uneasy.   As
       a safeguarding arrangement the sleeping arrangements were changed  so
       the claimant would sleep downstairs.


143. She stated that the demands made by the claimant to  the  foster  carer
       were not typical of a 15 year old  and  that  he  had  asked  her  to
       arrange for a driving licence because he said he could  drive.   When
       asked in cross examination  why that was not in  the  notes  and  she
       said that she could have been mistaken.  In any  event  she  accepted
       that it was not necessarily indicative of age.  He  also  wanted  his
       share of the fostering allowance and asked for extra money but  would
       not say what it was for.  He had said that his pocket money was  that
       for a child and "not for someone like him" but did  not  say  exactly
       what  he  meant.   She  added  in  her  statement  that  he  was   an
       accomplished smoker referring to the manner  in  which  the  claimant
       smoked, held cigarettes and would extinguish them and she  said  that
       she had noted that his pupils appeared dilated on  two  of  the  four
       occasions that she saw him.  She said that his Adam's apple  appeared
       quite prominent, which could indicate physical maturity.  She went on
       to say that the claimant found it difficult to be treated in any  way
       as a young person of his claimed age and there did not appear  to  be
       the usual difficulties of adolescent behaviour but he behaved  as  an
       adult speaking to another adult.  She stated that he did not need  to
       appear any form of additional care which a 15 year  old  child  would
       require.


144. In her oral evidence Ms Constable relied on her statement and was  then
       asked about the notes which  purportedly  came  from  the  diary  and
       telephone of Mrs Weldegebriel.  She confirmed that  she  had  created
       the notes when she had been asked by Croydon's legal  department  for
       the notes relating to the claimant.  The actual notes which had  been
       kept in a folder which had been handed over to the social worker when
       the placement had ended in 2013 had  disappeared  and  she  therefore
       spoke to Mrs Weldegebriel in an attempt  to  reconstruct  the  diary.
       Two folders had been handed over, that relating to  the  appointments
       made with doctors, a dentist, the Refugee Council and so on  and  the
       other relating to informal notes relating to matters which would  not
       normally be disclosed to the child in care.  The first set  of  notes
       would, however, go with him when he left care as  a  record  of,  for
       example, illnesses down to minutiae  such  as  when  a  child  had  a
       headache or was given paracetamol.  She said that the carer had  told
       her that she had given the papers to the social worker but  had  then
       been given part of the folder to  give  to  the  young  person.   The
       social worker should not have done this as it should have  gone  back
       to Social Services: the social worker should keep both parts  if  the
       young person leaves care and would hand over the second part  if  the
       child stayed in care.  She had created the notes around 7  July  2014
       after having asked the carer whether or not she had  her  appointment
       diary and for other notes.  She accepted that on  occasions  she  had
       had to prompt Mrs Weldegebriel.  She was also able  to  look  at  the
       text messages sent to her but she had not kept these as  Croydon  has
       changed the phone which she carried.  She  said  that  she  had  left
       blanks where Mrs Weldegebriel could not recall something.


145. She was asked how often she had seen the claimant  and  she  said  that
       she believed that she had seen him three times while with  the  carer
       and she thought one time previously.  Twice she had seen the claimant
       on Carolina Road - the road where the claimant  had  lived  with  Mrs
       Weldegebriel.  On those occasions she had been visiting other  carers
       in that road.  However, prior to  the  placement  she  had  seen  the
       claimant, she believed, standing with other  young  men  in  Portland
       Road, South Norwood.  They had blocked her way before allowing her to
       pass.  She described the young men  as  towering  over  her  and  she
       thought that the claimant was one of them.  She said that she had had
       to look up at them and that he might have  been  smoking.   She  said
       that that had not been put into her statement  because  she  had  not
       been asked about it.  She referred to two other  occasions  when  she
       had seen the claimant on the street firstly coming out of the carer's
       house and secondly at the corner shop with the foster carer's son and
       another child in care from Eritrea called Mehane.


146. She confirmed that when she had seen the claimant at  the  foster  home
       he was not smoking and said that she had asked the  foster  carer  if
       the claimant had smoked because she had smelled smoke.  The carer had
       said that she thought so but had never seen him with a  cigarette  in
       his hand.  Asked if she had seen him smoking on the  other  occasions
       she referred to the other occasion when he was with the  three  young
       men but then said that  she  could  not  be  100%  that  it  was  the
       claimant.  Asked why she had said that he was an accomplished  smoker
       she said that she knew how people who  smoked  regularly  behaved  as
       opposed to those who  just  have  the  odd  cigarette.   It  was  the
       claimant's mannerisms that made her feel that he was older.  She  was
       asked why she had said that the claimant's pupils  were  dilated  and
       she said that that was what she had seen although she  accepted  that
       on that occasion she had been on the other side  of  the  road.   She
       confirmed she had not smelled drugs on the claimant.


147. Asked about the request he had made regarding money she said  that  she
       had learnt this from the carer when she had gone to verify  what  the
       claimant could or could not have.  She was asked why she had  put  in
       her statement the quotation that  the  claimant  had  said  that  the
       amount of money he received was "not for someone  like  me"  and  she
       said that at that time she had had a lot going  on  and  she  thought
       that he looked like an adult and as he was new in the country it  was
       surprising that he would be so clued up.


148. She confirmed that she had agreed with  the  carer  that  the  claimant
       should be moved downstairs and she believed that that  had  happened.
       She explained the furnishings of the room into which he was to move.


149. In cross-examination she described her experience and stated  that  she
       had not known of another instance where a file had gone missing.  She
       then went on again to describe  the  four  times  she  had  seen  the
       claimant.  The first in Portland Road, the second on 17  May  at  the
       carer's house, the third when she had passed him on Carolina Road and
       the fourth when she had seen him at the corner shop with Mehane.


150. With regard to the notes made after the placement visit she  said  that
       these had been rough notes - the redacted parts of the notes  related
       to the other children in the carer's house.


151. She said that the witness statement had been created before  the  notes
       which purported to be a reconstruction of  the  carer's  folder  were
       made.  She was asked whether or not it was unprofessional for her  to
       have reconstructed the notes and she said that this was what she  had
       been asked to do by the legal department at Croydon.


152. With regard to whether or not the claimant was confrontational she  was
       asked whether or not he had been confrontational  with  her  and  she
       said that he was not although she described  him  as  being  "passive
       aggressive".   She  said  that  it  appeared  that  Mehane,  who  was
       interpreting, was telling him  to  calm  down.   She  said  that  she
       accepted that the foster carer could not be expected to have  someone
       in her house who was 30 or  40  or  even  20.   With  regard  to  the
       claimant's independence skills she said that he could take  transport
       and had used his money to get a bus pass.


Evidence of Liston Williams


153. By the date of  hearing  the  defendant  had  lost  touch  with  Liston
       Williams and therefore he did not give evidence.  However, there  was
       a statement from him on file.  He was  the  looked  after  children's
       reviewing officer and a child protection chair  practitioner  and  he
       said that he had worked since  1985  "in  the  field  of  adolescence
       qualifying as a social worker in 1996 specialising  in  working  with
       young people".  He said that he was aware that assessments of age are
       a very complex task


           "which is a holistic process and not an exact science.  However,
           in my opinion I strongly believe that from my  observations  and
           discussion with C strongly  suggest  that  he  is  significantly
           older than his claimed age".


154. He referred to the LAC review on 5 June 2013 saying that  the  claimant
       had interacted positively and made a good contribution  and  that  he
       had said that he had wanted to resume  contact  with  his  family  in
       Sudan and that the review had not been told that the claimant's birth
       family had been killed.  He said that the claimant's overall physical
       appearance and overall general demeanour  had  convinced  his  social
       worker that he would  be  more  appropriately  transferred  to  adult
       services.   He  said  that  his  opinion  was  not  based  purely  on
       appearance  but  involved  an  assessment   of   all   the   expected
       developmental factors  associated  with  a  minor  and  that  he  had
       expressed reservations regarding the  safeguarding  concerns  of  the
       claimant being accommodated in a foster placement  and  in  a  school
       environment.  He had not known that UKBA provided information to  the
       LAC team.


Discussion


155. At the beginning of this judgment I set out,  in  brief,  the  relevant
       chronology following the claimant's claim for asylum.  I now  propose
       to amplify that chronology and to deal in  greater  detail  with  the
       various  reports  which  were  relevant  to  the  assessment  of  the
       claimant's age. When setting out the terms  of  the  reports  I  have
       briefly commented on the weight to be  placed  on  each.   The  first
       document is the UKBA referral to Child Welfare Services dated 3 April
       2013.  It gave the claimant's date of birth as 15 December  1994  but
       stated that that age was disputed.  A letter  of  that  date  to  the
       claimant gives that date of birth in the heading but  noted  that  he
       had claimed that his date of birth was 15 December 1997.  The  letter
       stated that that claimed date of birth was not accepted.  However, as
       his physical appearance/demeanour "does  not  very  strongly  suggest
       that you are significantly over 18 years of age" UKBA would treat him
       according to the process designed for the handling of  asylum  claims
       from children.


156. A note dated 4 April  referred  to  the  foster  carer  with  whom  the
       claimant had been placed, Sajjad  Abid,  stating  that  when  he  had
       collected the claimant  he  had  told  the  social  worker  that  the
       claimant looked much older than his claimed age and that he had  said
       that the claimant looked about 25 years old plus.  The  foster  carer
       had not wanted to accommodate the claimant but he was allowed to stay
       for one night.  An age assessment was to be arranged.


157. Thereafter the claimant was placed in bed and  breakfast  accommodation
       for adults until the age assessment could take  place.   He  remained
       there until 13 May 2013 when he was placed with Mrs Weldegebriel.


158. The age assessment took place on  25  April.   It  was  clearly  Merton
       compliant.  The introduction states that  it  was  conducted  by  two
       qualified social workers, Mr Facey and Mr Oyeleye, and it  was  noted
       that when the claimant was asked if he understood  why  he  had  been
       invited to the assessment he stated that he did not know.  The report
       noted that the claimant was of "small/medium build"  and  his  height
       was estimated to be approximately five foot seven inches.  His weight
       was estimated and it was stated that he  had  a  "size  8  foot"  and
       approximately a 24 inch waist and it was said that he had a "slightly
       developed" Adam's apple.  He had no visible facial hair and the palms
       of his hands were smooth.  His voice was not fully broken.


159. The claimant had told the social workers that he was 15 years  old  and
       had been born on 15 December 1997. He told the  social  workers  that
       his mother had told him his age when he was 12 years old as the  Imam
       who taught him how to read the Qu'ran had asked what his age was.  He
       had said that there was no office or place where his birth could have
       been registered in the region in which he  lived  in  Darfur.   Asked
       about his family he had told the social workers that he had lost  his
       mother, father, sister, a brother and uncle  and  that  he  had  left
       Sudan because his life was in danger.


160. He gave the social workers details of his journey  to  Britain  and  in
       particular the experiences he had  had  in  Greece  and  Italy.   The
       social workers noted that he appeared to have been fully  cooperative
       and used his body language to express himself.  He  gave  details  of
       his education but there  seems  to  have  been  no  answers  recorded
       regarding his self-care skills.


161. A section deals with the analysis of the information and states:-


           "In our assessment as qualified  social  worker  (sic)  we  have
           extensive experience of interviewing and  working  with  asylum-
           seeking young people and agree that R's physical  appearance  is
           consistent with the age range of 15 - 17 years old."


162. The analysis went on to say:-


           "...  We also found R to be cooperative and he worked with us to
           provide significant dates of his journey to the UK.


           In some aspects of the interview we noticed that R was emotional
           when discussing how he lost his family in  connection  with  the
           ongoing tribal war in Sudan.  We noticed during R's short ten  -
           fifteen minute break he was able to reflect upon  his  story  to
           assist us with making our decision about his age.  R presents as
           being softly spoken and consistent with his answers.


           ...  We accept the  emotional  burden  that  R  has  experienced
           regarding the death of his birth family which  might  has  (sic)
           impacted upon his physical appearance, possibly making him  look
           slightly older  than  his  claimed  age.   In  addition  to  his
           experience of living on the streets in  Tripoli,  Greece,  Italy
           and France.


           We also took into consideration that R has been deeply  affected
           by being forced to leave his country of birth;  family  to  fend
           for himself as he presents as being streetwise and guarded  when
           speaking  about  his  life  experience.   With  the  information
           obtained for the purpose of this interview we  were  have  given
           consideration  regarding  R's  physical  appearance,   demeanour
           culture, religion and life experience  we  have  given  him  the
           benefit of doubt maintained his claimed age." (sic)


163. The claimant was then given the formal  assessment  of  his  age  which
       stated that his date of birth  was  15/December/1997  "age  15  years
       old".  The date of assessment was noted as 25 April 2013.   The  date
       of decision is given as 13 May.


164.  It  is  of  particular  note  that  during  the   age   assessment   a
       representative from the  Croydon  Refugee  Centre,  Ron  Brajaer  was
       present.  Mr Brajaer  recorded  clearly  the  questions  and  answers
       asked.  His detailed notes show that  the  examining  social  workers
       complied with the Merton criteria and that they covered  all  aspects
       of the claimant's life including his education,  his  health  history
       and the history of  his  family.   When  considering  the  claimant's
       physical appearance he had been asked to lift his shirt and  although
       clearly he was not given a full physical examination  detailed  notes
       were taken about  his  size,  build  and  physical  appearance.   The
       claimant also set out the length of time he had spent travelling  and
       said that his parents had died in November 2010.   He  gave  his  age
       when he had arrived in Libya as being 13 years 8 months and said that
       the whole journey had taken approximately two years five months.


165. The claimant had been asked where he wanted to live -  whether  with  a
       foster carer, semi-independent or in  NASS  accommodation  for  those
       over 18 and had said that he wished to live with a "carer/family"  so
       that there would be someone to care for him if he was not well.


166. The age assessment was thorough and  gives  every  indication  that  Mr
       Facey and Mr Oyeleye took great care to undertake a Merton  compliant
       assessment.  The age assessment was the only time that the claimant's
       physique  was  considered  and  it  is  of  note  that  the  claimant
       emphasised that he wished to have a carer to look after him - he  did
       not wish to live in a "semi-independent" accommodation.


167. I consider that the report was one on which  very  considerable  weight
       should be placed given that  it  was  undertaken  by  social  workers
       employed by Croydon and who were clearly experienced in assessing the
       age of asylum-seeking children.


168. The claimant was placed with Mrs Weldegebriel  on  13  May  2013.   Mrs
       Weldegebriel clearly thought that the appellant was  older  than  his
       claimed age but it was evident that she was somewhat  thrown  by  the
       fact that she believed that the claimant had  been  placed  with  her
       immediately on arrival but then found  that  he  had  been  known  to
       Croydon Refugee Centre for some weeks.  There appears to have been  a
       breakdown of communication between her and Croydon Social Services at
       that stage.


169. Her concerns were evident in the fostering support  supervision  record
       dated 17 May 2013 when what were referred to as "safeguarding" issues
       were raised on the basis that the claimant seemed older than 16.   It
       was then that arrangements were made for him to sleep downstairs.   I
       note, however, that it was stated that the claimant had tried to  fit
       in with the culture of the placement but that "the carer  feels  that
       at times the younger people irritate him but he  has  not  shown  any
       form of aggression".


170. A personal education plan was prepared on 23 May and it appears that  a
       looked after child visit was made to the placement  address  on  that
       day.  Ms Akingbeme stated:


           "C was first seen alone and he informed me that he  is  settling
           gradually at his foster placement.  He  said  he  is  trying  to
           adapt to his new environment and gets on well with  everyone  in
           the household, including another looked after  young  person  he
           shares the placement with.  Carer reported that C has settled in
           well.  Carer said C is well-behaved and had responds (sic)  well
           to boundaries.  There were no worries,  concerns  or  complaints
           reported during this meeting.  ...  C  was  told  the  placement
           rules and boundaries which he said he is happy  to  abide  with.
           We had discussion about the allowances that C  will  be  getting
           from his carer.  C said he is managing well with the �10  pocket
           money he receives but run out of money because he uses  part  of
           the money to top up his Oyster Card.  Carer advised C  that  the
           �10 for his own use and needs to tell her if he needs to top  up
           his Oyster.  Carer reported an application for free  Oyster  had
           been completed and C will be taking it to the refugee council to
           get it signed".


171. On 5 June there was a looked after  child  meeting  chaired  by  Liston
       Williams.  The relevant document is  headed  "ICSLAC  review  chair's
       report regarding RMH held on 5 June 2013" and noted that "the  foster
       carer did not have any significant concerns regarding  R's  behaviour
       or emotional development.   He  (sic)  described  R's  self-care  and
       cooking skills are  well-developed  (sic).   The  foster  carer  will
       continue to support R in all aspects of  his  Muslim  religion.   The
       report also states that the claimant had said that the Imam in  Sudan
       had informed him of his age but noted that


           "the chair believes that R is significantly older than 20  years
           old and thus being  placed  in  mainstream  education  would  be
           wholly  inappropriate  with   clear   safeguarding   issues   to
           consider".


172. The report went on to say that:-


           "R informed the review that his family composition consisted  of
           father - (MH); mother (FH); brother (HH) and paternal uncle  who
           all remain living in Sudan.  ...  R explained that he would like
           to resume contact with them in some capacity but  was  concerned
           about them being victimised by government officials.  The  chair
           has asked that the social worker or foster (sic)  explained  the
           process of the Red Cross tracing service to R."


173. It was said that the chair and the social worker  believed  that  there
       are "very obvious" signs that the claimant  was  significantly  older
       than his claimed age and that the chair believed that he was at least
       20.


174. I am concerned about this  report  on  two  counts.   Firstly  that  it
       appears to record that the claimant had said that he wished to get in
       touch with his family when the reality is that at the age  assessment
       and when first interviewed on his claim for asylum he stated that his
       family  were  dead  and  I  consider  that  that  reflects   on   the
       thoroughness of the assessment. Secondly the reality is  that  Liston
       Williams cannot be traced by the defendant and therefore could not be
       cross-examined.  I therefore consider  that  less  weight  should  be
       placed on that report.


175. On 15  May  2013  the  Home  Office  informed  the  claimant  that  his
       fingerprints matched those of a person  who  had  claimed  asylum  in
       Italy and that therefore Italy would be responsible  for  his  asylum
       claim under the terms of the Dublin II Regulations.  The Home  Office
       wrote to Croydon Children Services, giving  the  claimant's  date  of
       birth as 15 December 1997 and referring to  the  transfer  acceptance
       from the Italian Interior Ministry which stated that the  appellant's
       name was AZMI, that he was a national of Chad and his date  of  birth
       was 1 January 1994.   It  is  of  note,  however,  that  the  Italian
       authorities had originally given that individual a date of  birth  of
       1984 but that had later been amended.


176. Clearly that information was given weight when it was decided that  the
       appellant's age should be reassessed.


177. I have considered the evidence from Italy which was not only  that  the
       Claimant was from Chad with a date of birth of  1  January  1994  but
       also that he had arrived at Fiumicino Airport in  Rome  on  a  flight
       from Algiers.


178. While I accept that there is a fingerprint  match  and  that  therefore
       the claimant had had his  fingerprints  taken  in  Italy  as  a  step
       towards claiming asylum there it does not follow that he is  AZMI  or
       that 1 January 1994 is his date of birth.


179. On 17 June 2013 Susan Akingbeme sent an email to Ms  Constable  in  the
       following terms:-


           "There is a proposal to complete age report/addendum for  RH  on
           19/06/13 upon which you will be given decision on that day.  The
           decision is likely to make R an adult based on other  supporting
           evidence with regard to his claimed age.  I will  therefore  ask
           Tsega to bring R with his belongings  to  the  office  (Jeanette
           Wallace)on Wednesday for the decision after  which  he  will  be
           sent to NASS for support.


           Therefore I call for the placement  to  be  ended  on  Wednesday
           19/06/13 due to this development."


180. The terms of that email make it clear that by 17 June  a  decision  had
       been made that the claimant was no longer to remain in  the  care  of
       the defendant.


181. The age review assessment took place on  19  June.   While  the  report
       referred to the necessity of a holistic assessment of the  claimant's
       age it referred to the further evidence which had been received  from
       the Home Office  regarding  the  claim  made  in  Italy  and  it  was
       considered that the claimant had been dishonest because he had  given
       conflicting names and dates of birth.  What is of concern is that the
       claimant appears to have been called  to  the  review  without  being
       informed that his care arrangements were about to be  changed,  there
       was no independent adult there and there seems to have been no way in
       which he was given a chance to respond to the  information  that  had
       been put to him.  The reality appears to be that the review  was  the
       way in which the claimant was told that his care was to  come  to  an
       end.  Rather than a continuation of the original assessment  it  was,
       it appears, completely without the safeguards which would lead  to  a
       Merton compliant decision - the safeguards which were clearly set out
       in the original form when the assessment took place on 24 April.


182. Thereafter the claimant was put into NASS accommodation for adults  and
       at  some  stage  in  August  he  was  on  the  streets  before  being
       transferred to NASS accommodation in Birmingham.


183. Before I consider the claimant's evidence which was,  of  course,  that
       his date of birth  was  15  December  1997  I   believe  that  it  is
       appropriate  to consider whether it is correct that he is from  Sudan
       and also what route he took in order to come to Britain as both those
       factors are cast into doubt by the Eurodac information which had been
       received from the Italian authorities.


184. I consider that the report of Dr Verney is persuasive and  particularly
       taking into account the specific nature of the local words which were
       used by the claimant I  conclude  that  he  is  from  Khutum  and  is
       therefore Sudanese.


185. With regard to the claimant's travel to Britain  he  asserted  that  he
       had travelled from Sudan to Libya where he had  spent  some  time  in
       Tripoli, and had then travelled to Greece arriving in Patras.  He had
       been detained with his cousin in Patras before being released and had
       travelled from there to Athens where his  cousin  had  worked  before
       again travelling clandestinely  to  Italy  and  thence  by  train  to
       Ventimiglia where he had been picked up by  the  Italian  authorities
       and fingerprinted.  He denied that he  had  ever  claimed  asylum  in
       Italy or that he had given a false name or date of  birth  or  indeed
       that he had arrived in Italy at Fiumicino Airport in Rome.


186. I consider that it would have been difficult for the claimant  to  have
       got onto a plane in Algiers and then flown  to  Rome.  Moreover,  the
       route which the claimant gave showing  his  journey  to  Britain  via
       Greece and Italy is a well-trodden path for asylum  seekers.  I  note
       that there is no record of his being fingerprinted in  Greece  or  of
       his having made a claim there,  but  having  noted  the  evidence  of
       Anastasia Papanastasiou, who is a member of the appeals committee  of
       the  asylum  service  in  Greece  regarding   the  somewhat   chaotic
       procedures in Greece, the fact that there  is  no  evidence   of  the
       claimant having been fingerprinted there as  he  claimed  is  not,  I
       consider, significant.  What is relevant, however, is that  there  is
       considerable evidence not only from Ms Papanastasiou  but  also  from
       relevant case law which indicates that asylum seekers in  Greece  may
       well be mistreated and  indeed  mistreated  in  the  ways  which  the
       appellant claimed. I therefore find that the claimant  had  travelled
       through Greece as he had claimed and that he did enter Italy by boat.


187. In considering that evidence I note that the  first  document  received
       from Italy gave the claimant a date of birth of 1984 rather than 1994
       but that was amended.  That shows a minor but not  fatal  mistake  in
       the Italian authorities' recordkeeping.  Chad and South Sudan share a
       border and indeed part of South Sudan appears to "bulge"  into  Chad.
       However, as following Peter Verney's report I have concluded that the
       claimant is not from Chad I consider  that  the  information  in  the
       Italian record is wrong. I have also found that it is  unlikely  that
       the claimant entered at Italy by air. I have therefore concluded that
       I cannot place weight on the Eurodac  evidence  with  regard  to  the
       claimant's name, country of origin and date of birth.


188. It is, of course, possible that the claimant would have given  a  false
       date of birth  and  false  nationality  for  any  number  of  reasons
       including that he did not wish to  be  treated  as  a  child  by  the
       Italian authorities or he did not  wish  to  be  separated  from  his
       cousin.


189. It is the claimant's assertion that he was born  on  15  December  1997
       and that he knew his date of birth because that is what  his  parents
       had told him and indeed his father had written that date  down  on  a
       piece of paper for the sheikh who taught him at the religious  school
       which he had attended in Khutum.  I note  the  evidence  of  the  two
       other witnesses from Khutum that little  weight  was  put  on  either
       dates of birth or birthdays in South Sudan and  effectively  that  an
       assessment of  age  whether  at  the  khuram,  the  religious  school
       attached to the mosque, or for  any  other  purposes  was  of  little
       importance.  Although ZH stated that he had a  birth  certificate  it
       appears that his family were given the document because he  was  born
       in a hospital in Nyala.  He could recall little about  that  document
       and indeed the date was written in the Muslim calendar.  II's comment
       was that he knew his date of  birth  because  he  had  been  born  in
       Ramadan and therefore each Ramadan he knew he  was  one  year  older.
       That did not specifically indicate that he knew  his  exact  date  of
       birth or indeed his exact age although it appears that  his  date  of
       birth has been accepted by the Home Office and by the defendant.  The
       claimant said that his father was illiterate  although  he  could  do
       simple arithmetic for business purposes but I  consider  that  it  is
       highly improbable that the claimant was asked by the sheikh  who  ran
       the religious school for his date of birth and that his father  wrote
       it on a piece of paper. In all, I therefore do not  accept  that  the
       claimant was correct when he stated that he knew his  date  of  birth
       because it had been written down by his father. I consider it likely,
       however, that the claimant had been told an approximate  age  by  his
       parents.


190. I must also take into account the vagueness of the chronology  relating
       to his journey and the length of time he took in getting to  Britain.
       In his second statement he commented on an assertion in  the  grounds
       of defence that he had said at the screening interview  that  he  had
       left Sudan on 1 January 2012.  He said that that was not true  as  he
       had said that  he  had  spent  more  than  a  year  and  four  months
       travelling  since  leaving  Sudan.  He  complained  that   an   Iraqi
       interpreter had been used at the Home Office but that  it  was  clear
       from the notes taken when he had been interviewed  by  the  defendant
       that he was then claiming that had left Darfur in November 2010 after
       his parents had been killed.


191. However, the central issue before me is the actual  assessment  of  his
       age.


192. I therefore turn to consider the evidence of the  claimant's  witnesses
       and the witnesses for the  defendant.  I  note  that  the  claimant's
       supporting witnesses have all been able to observe  him  over  fairly
       long periods of time and have been able to  observe  him  with  other
       children and have had time to build up relationships with him.


193. I do, however, place weight on  the  first  age  assessment  which  was
       conducted by Mr Ken Facey and Mr  Adetunji  Oyeleye.   It  is  Merton
       compliant and it is clear from  the  form  that  the  relevant  self-
       directions  were  before  the  two   assessors.    Despite   possible
       misgivings they concluded that the claimant was a  child  and  indeed
       accepted that he was the age which  he  had  claimed.   They  reached
       their conclusion having specifically directed themselves to the  task
       in hand. That, indeed,  was  the  only  physical  assessment  of  the
       claimant.


194. I note the evidence of Ms Johnson, who  considered  that  the  claimant
       was the age he claimed to be.  She had observed him with other  young
       asylum seekers.  She has many years of experience of dealing with and
       observing such young individuals and I consider that her evidence was
       persuasive, particularly as I consider that she  was  clearly  not  a
       woman who would either be likely to be fooled by a young man claiming
       to be younger  than  he  was  nor  that  she  would  tolerate  anyone
       attempting to pull the wool over her eyes.


195. I also place weight on the evidence of Ms Bell, who again has seen  the
       claimant in a number of situations over a fairly long period of time.
        She again considered that the claimant was of the age he claimed  to
       be.  The fact that she had seen  the  claimant  interact  with  other
       children leads me to accept her evidence.


196. Mrs Ross had also seen the claimant more or  less  on  a  weekly  basis
       over a number of months.  She was clearly a kind and maternal  person
       who very much had the claimant's best interests at  heart.   While  I
       consider that she would not have had the experience of Ms Bell or  Ms
       Johnson in dispassionately assessing a young person  the  reality  is
       that she has seen the claimant and Joe play together both at home and
       at the seaside and while I consider that she has  maternal  instincts
       towards the claimant I believe that her strongest maternal  instincts
       would be towards her own child  and  that  she  would  be  absolutely
       focused on his welfare and would not allow  a  situation  to  develop
       where her son was placed in close proximity with an adult or  someone
       whose age made him an inappropriate companion.


197. The claimant's remaining witnesses were both of  assistance.   ZH  gave
       clear evidence that while he had been the claimant's older  brother's
       companion the claimant was very much younger than he - ZH is now aged
       21.  Similarly II gave some detail of knowing the claimant in  Khutum
       and attending the religious school with him.  I note that his own age
       is accepted and I consider that his evidence would place the claimant
       within two to three years of his own age given the way in  which  the
       "circles" in the religious school were set out.


198. I consider that Mr Ayub Khan was an honest  witness  and  it  is  clear
       that when the claimant was living with him he took on a paternal role
       towards the claimant.  He considered that the claimant was around the
       age he claimed and he was able  to  comment  on  the  fact  that  the
       claimant did not smoke, was not shaving and had poor domestic  skills
       for tidiness and cooking and indeed that  he  had  had  to  give  the
       claimant instructions as to how to travel around  Birmingham  and  to
       London.


199. Turning to the evidence for the defendant it  is  relevant  that,  with
       the exception of Mrs Weldegebriel the defendant's witnesses had never
       had time to get to know him. While I respect the initial  assessments
       of Ms Constable, Ms Akingbeme, the Home Office official and the first
       foster carer the reality is that none of them  have  spent  any  time
       observing the claimant interacting with other children or  young  men
       or have been able to build up any relationship with him.


200. I would emphasise that I consider that the defendant is  very  strongly
       hampered by  the  lack  of  contemporaneous  notes  setting  out  the
       concerns of the social workers and the foster carer.  I consider that
       the reconstruction of the foster carer's  notes  is  really  of  very
       little use as the reconstruction was made a year after  the  relevant
       events and there is  nothing  in  the  contemporaneous  documentation
       which backs up the detail of the  reconstructed  notes.  Indeed,  the
       details  set  out  in  the  statements  of  Ms  Constable   and   Mrs
       Weldegebriel were prepared for the hearing and were  not  necessarily
       an accurate reflection of their feelings at the time.


201. Ms  Constable  emphasised  in  her  statement  that  the  claimant  was
       irritable around young people.   That  is  in  the  notes  which  she
       prepared.  However, it is not reflected in the assessment  made  when
       the claimant was visited at the carer's house where it was said  that
       he appeared to get on well with the  other  children  in  the  house.
       Similarly her claim that the claimant was  an  "accomplished  smoker"
       really did not stand up in cross-examination.  On the  first  of  the
       four occasions on which she saw him  and  she  thought  he  might  be
       smoking she was not certain that it was he  and  indeed  not  certain
       that he was smoking.  She also stated that he had  towered  over  her
       which taking into account her own height of five  foot  six  and  the
       height of the claimant at about five foot eight according to the  age
       assessment and the fact that Ms Akingbeme described him as about five
       foot five, that  would not have been the case.  Although  she  stated
       that she had seen him with his eyes dilated that appeared to be  when
       she had seen him across the road and cannot possibly be correct.  The
       reality is that there  was  nothing  on  which  she  could  base  the
       assertion in her statement that he was  an  accomplished  smoker  and
       indeed Mrs Weldegebriel had said that she had not seen  the  claimant
       smoke although she had smelled smoke on him - something that no other
       witnesses apart from Ms Constable and Ms  Akingbeme  had  said.   The
       reality is that I consider Ms Constable was alert to the concerns  of
       Mrs Weldegebriel regarding moving the claimant  downstairs  and  made
       arrangements for that but that  her  notes  of  the  meeting  at  the
       carer's home give absolutely no indication that the claimant had  the
       behaviour patterns of an adult.


202. Similarly while I accept that Mrs Weldegebriel felt that  the  claimant
       was much older than he claimed to be I consider that the notes  which
       claimed to be a reconstruction of her folder were not in fact such  a
       reconstruction. It was clear from her evidence that she was uneasy at
       the various  matters  being  put  to  her  regarding  the  claimant's
       domestic skills and  confidence  outside  the  house.  I  prefer  the
       evidence of Mrs Ross regarding the immaturity of the claimant but the
       strongest evidence is that of Mr Khan who  actually  lived  with  the
       claimant for some time and considered that his domestic  skills  were
       undeveloped even for someone of his claimed age.  I also note that it
       was asserted that the claimant had stated that the carer's  allowance
       should be paid to him but there is no contemporaneous note to back up
       that assertion and from the contemporaneous notes it  is  clear  that
       the only monetary issue related to the Oyster card  and  the  payment
       for it - the claimant had had to pay for travel  when  that  was  not
       part of the money which was for his personal use.


203. While I have noted the statement of Mr Liston Williams he did not  give
       evidence before me and I consider that  I  can  place  little  weight
       thereon.  Again it was a statement prepared  long  after  the  events
       which had taken place and does  not  reflect  what  was  in  his  LAC
       report.  There is in particular the statement in the report that  the
       claimant had asked that his family be traced through  the  Red  Cross
       whereas the reality is that the claimant has  always  said  that  his
       parents and family were killed.  That statement does not fit in  with
       the notes prepared by Ron Braeger of  the  Refugee  Council  who  was
       present.


204. In all, when I consider the various factors  on  which  to  assess  the
       claimant's age I conclude that the claimant was not at  the  time  of
       the assessment an adult. I have not accepted the Eurodac evidence  as
       being accurate  in  anything  but  the  fact  that  the  Clamant  was
       fingerprinted in Italy. For the reasons given I place greater  weight
       on the evidence of Mrs Ross who considers  that  the  claimant  is  a
       suitable companion for her 15 year old son, Ms Johnson and Ms Bell as
       well as Mr Ayub Khan - the people who have seen him over long periods
       of time and seen his interact with other children of his  age  rather
       than the defendant's witnesses. I also place weight on  the  evidence
       of the two young men who  had  known  the  claimant  in  Khutum.   In
       particular I note ZH's assessment that he was the same age  as  HMHH,
       the claimant's brother.


205. I would add that I did not consider that the evidence  put  forward  by
       the defendant was persuasive partially because the statements and the
       reconstruction of the  social  work  folder  which  Mrs  Weldegebriel
       handed over was made some considerable time after the event but  also
       because I consider that there  was  a  certain  amount  of  prompting
       between the legal department in Croydon and  Ms  Constable  when  her
       statement was prepared and when the notes were then "reconstructed".


206.  I place particular weight on the  age  assessment  of  24  April  2013
       which  was  the  only  proper  "Merton  compliant"   age   assessment
       undertaken and which was made by experienced  social workers.


207. In all I consider that the date of birth which the claimant gave of  15
       December 1997, which was accepted at the first age assessment, is  an
       appropriate date of birth for him.


208. I would add that I am concerned about the procedures at  Croydon  which
       led to the reassessment.  It seems to me that the reality was that  a
       decision had been made to reassess the claimant as  an  adult  before
       the reassessment took place and the claimant was given no opportunity
       to refute the reasons for the reassessment. I do not consider that it
       was appropriate that the reassessment should have been  taking  place
       without a suitable adult present to support the  claimant.  Indeed  I
       note that the letter from the local authority of 15 January  2014  to
       the claimant's solicitors stated:-


           "We have experience of providing social workers to assist  young
           persons in their dealings with the local authority, for  example
           providing personal advisers  to  those  in  post-18  after  care
           service.   Your  client's  social  worker  or  key  worker   can
           therefore observe your client's age assessment interview if your
           client wishes.  Alternative persons  your  client  may  wish  to
           consider are a friend/family member, a representative  from  the
           refugee council,  a  representative  from  Voice,  the  official
           solicitor or your client's litigation friend.


           If your client cannot arrange an  adult  observer's  attendance,
           but wishes to have one in attendance, LB Croydon are willing  to
           arrange for an appropriate observer on your client's  behalf  if
           your client wishes".


209. The reality is that had such a reassessment taken place and indeed,  if
       as proposed at that stage a dental examination had been considered as
       indeed was requested in the week before the hearing these proceedings
       could have been avoided or at least shortened.


210. I would also add that I  am  concerned  about  the  way  in  which  the
       various statements in this case were prepared.   In  particular  the
       statements which were prepared for the two minor witnesses  for  the
       claimant who were approached direct and not through  an  appropriate
       adult, were apparently asked  questions  over  the  phone  and  then
       presented with a document to sign which was in English and which was
       not translated for them and which they not given any opportunity  to
       question.  I would add also that it is apparent from the  file  that
       the defendant wished to reconsider the  assessment  and  I  consider
       that the claimant' representatives were wrong to reject the  further
       assessment which was proposed by  the  defendant  in  January  2014.
       However, the reality is that the reassessment of 19 June 2013 was, I
       consider, flawed because the claimant had no-one with  him  when  he
       was reassessed.

   Decision

    On the basis of my assessment, I make a declaration  that  the  claimant
    was born on 15 December 1997.

  Direction

    Subject to any submissions  from either party, I  propose   to  make  an
    order  that the defendant  pay the a claimant's costs in a  sum  to  be
    agreed or, in default of agreement, to be determined by the Tribunal on
    the basis of written  submissions  not to exceed  4  pages   from  each
    party.
