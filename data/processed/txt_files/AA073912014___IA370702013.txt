Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Parkin, of Counsel, instructed by World-wide
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Staunton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


Anonymity Order
I make an order under r.14(1) of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008 prohibiting the disclosure or publication of  any  matter  likely
to lead members of the public to identify the child referred  to  herein  as
"L". I therefore issue an anonymity order which extends  to  the  applicant.
No report of these proceedings shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  L.
This direction applies to both the applicant and to the respondent.  Failure
to comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

Introduction and background facts:

 1. The appellant is a national of  Tunisia,  born  on  11  June  1995.  He
    arrived in the UK on 20 January 2013 with entry clearance as a  visitor
    valid until 7 July 2013. He had appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  ("FtT")  against   the   following
    decisions of the respondent:

    i)     a decision of 23 August 2013 refusing his  application  made  in
         time, on 5 July 2013; and

    ii)    a decision of 18 September 2014 to refuse his asylum claim  made
         on 3 April 2014 at a time when his leave was being  extended  under
         s.3C of the Immigration Act 1971 (the "1971 Act").

    The appellant's leave remains extended under s.3C  because  his  appeal
    against the decision of 23 August 2013 has not been finally determined.



 2. In February 2013, the appellant met a Ms E G (hereafter "Ms G"), who is
    a national of Colombia. Ms G and the appellant were engaged in  October
    2013 and married on 30 January 2014.  Ms  G  has  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in the UK. She has a daughter ("L") who was born in  the  UK  in
    August 2006 and who was 8 years old at the date of the hearing  of  the
    appellant's appeal (26 November 2014). L is a British citizen.

 3. The appellant's appeals were heard on 26 November 2014 before Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Oakley, who dismissed  the  appeals  on  asylum
    grounds, under the Immigration Rules and on human rights  grounds.  The
    appellant sought permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  ("UT")
    which was refused by the  FtT.  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Martin  refused
    permission on the asylum grounds and in relation to Article 3. However,
    she granted permission to challenge the judge's assessment  of  Article
    8, in  particular,  his  finding  that  there  were  no  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life continuing in  Tunisia  when  the  appellant's
    wife, with whom the judge accepted the  appellant  had  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship, has an 8-year-old daughter who lives with  her
    but who has a regular and ongoing relationship with her  father.  Judge
    Martin considered that this arguably created an insurmountable obstacle
    to the family relocating to Tunisia.  Judge Martin had before  her  the
    second ground which, in essence, contended that, as  L  was  a  British
    citizen, it was not reasonable to require her to leave the territory of
    the European Union permanently. In this  regard,  reliance  was  placed
    upon Sanade and others (British children - Zambrano  -  Dereci)  [2012]
    UKUT 00048 (IAC). The  grounds  contend  that,  by  extension,  it  was
    unlawful to separate L from her mother; and that, if family  life  were
    to continue outside the UK, one of these events would have to occur.

The "error of law" hearing

 4. The judge accepted that L  had  regular  contact  with  her  biological
    father and that she had a close relationship with him.  Although L  was
    living with her biological mother and  had  regular  contact  with  her
    biological father, the judge found that it was in L's best interests to
    live with  one  of  her  parents  (her  father).  It  follows  that  he
    contemplated that L would cease living with her mother.

 5. On 23 September  2015  (the  "error  of  law"  hearing),  I  heard  the
    appellant's appeal and announced that the judge had materially erred in
    law and set aside the following findings:

    i)     in relation to the  appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules,  his
         finding that there were no insurmountable obstacles to family  life
         continuing between the appellant  and  Ms  G  outside  the  UK  and
         therefore that the appellant did not satisfy  EX.1(b)  of  Appendix
         FM; and

    ii)    in relation to the  appeal  outside  the  Immigration  Rules  on
         Article 8 grounds, his finding that it was in  L's  best  interests
         for her to be with one of her biological parents and his conclusion
         that the decision was not disproportionate.

 6. My reasons are given in my decision promulgated on 16 November 2015.  I
    decided that the judge's error was not to be found in  the  appellant's
    grounds. In summary, I considered that the judge's finding that it  was
    in the best interests of L to remain with one of her biological parents
    was illogical, since she was at the time of the hearing living with her
    biological mother and she  had  regular  contact  with  her  biological
    father with whom the judge found she  has  a  close  relationship.  His
    finding that it was in L's best interests to  have  something  markedly
    less than that which she was then enjoying was irrational.  In  effect,
    he did not consider her  best  interests.  Instead,  he  conflated  his
    assessment  of  her  best  interests  with  what  he   considered   was
    reasonable.

 7. At the "error of law" hearing, Mr Parkin and Mr Wilding  (who  appeared
    for the respondent) were agreed that I had sufficient information to re-
    make the decision on the appeal. I did not agree. My reasons are  given
    at para 27 of the "error of law" decision. In summary, I  said  that  I
    could not see how any proper assessment of the question  whether  there
    are insurmountable obstacles to family life being  enjoyed  in  Tunisia
    between the appellant and Ms G could be undertaken without evidence  of
    the impact on L of either going to Tunisia with her mother or remaining
    in the UK whilst her mother relocates to Tunisia.

 8. At paras 28-29 of the "error of law" decision, I  put  the  parties  on
    notice that the parties should deal  with  a  third  option,  i.e.  the
    option of the appellant returning to Tunisia to make an entry clearance
    application to re-join Ms G, which the  parties  should  deal  with.  I
    indicated that my preliminary view was that Chikwamba  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 40 could be distinguished  on
    three grounds, as follows:

    i)     First, that it is by no means clear that the appellant satisfies
         the requirements for entry clearance as  a  spouse,  given  Ms  G's
         earnings of  approximately  ï¿½13,000  per  annum  (para  23  of  the
         determination of the judge).

    ii)     Secondly,  that  the  appellant  does  not  have   a   parental
         relationship with L.

    iii)   Thirdly, that L  has  only  known  the  appellant  for  a  short
         duration.

 9. Thus it was that the resumed hearing took place before me on 2 December
    2015.

The resumed hearing

10. At the commencement of the hearing, Mr Parkin informed me that the only
    evidence he relied upon in the bundle submitted under cover of a letter
    dated 25 November 2015 is the ultrasound evidence at page  18b  of  the
    bundle which relates to the unborn child of the appellant and Ms G.  He
    requested permission to rely upon this evidence on the ground  that  it
    relates to a fact that has arisen since the hearing before  the  judge.
    Mr Staunton did not object to its admission. Mr Parkin informed me that
    he did not rely upon the evidence at pages 16, 17, 18a, 19a and 19b  of
    this bundle.

11. I asked Mr Parkin to ensure that he drew my attention to  any  evidence
    in the bundle that was before  the  judge  if  it  is  relied  upon  in
    connection with the issues that were before me. My  attention  was  not
    drawn to nay such evidence.

12. At the commencement of the hearing, Mr Parkin and  Mr  Staunton  agreed
    that, in the event that it was necessary for me to consider the Article
    8 claim outside the Immigration Rules, it would not be necessary for me
    to conduct the full five-step approach to assessing Article 8 claims as
    explained by Lord Bingham at para of R (Razgar) v SSHD (2004) UKHL  27;
    it would be sufficient for me to make any additional  findings  that  I
    consider are necessary and conduct the balancing exercise in  order  to
    decide whether the decision is disproportionate.

13. In SSHD v SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387,  the  Court  of  Appeal  held
    that, in the consideration of an Article 8 claim of an  individual  who
    had established family life at a time when his/her  immigration  status
    was  "precarious"  (as  this   term   is   understood   in   Strasbourg
    jurisprudence, to be distinguished from the meaning of this term  under
    s.117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  (the  "NIAA
    2002"), see (AM (Malawi) [2015] UKUT 0260 IAC), the balancing  exercise
    is  to  be  carried  out  by  asking  whether  the  circumstances  were
    exceptional in cases that do not involve children  and  by  considering
    whether the circumstances were compelling  in  cases  that  do  involve
    children.

14. By way of shorthand only, I refer  to  these  different  approaches  as
    "tests" although, strictly speaking, they are not tests, as such:  they
    merely describe how pressing an individual's circumstances need  to  be
    so that due weight is given to the state's interests.

15. I invited Mr Parkin and Mr Staunton to address  me  on  the  applicable
    test in the instant case, given that L is not the applicant's  daughter
    and that he does not have a parental relationship with her.  Mr  Parkin
    submitted that the applicable test is that of compelling  circumstances
    because Ms G has a parental  relationship  with  L  and  therefore  the
    decision will impact upon L. Mr Staunton submitted  that  the  test  of
    exceptionality applies.

16. Mr Parkin submitted that the best interests of the  applicant's  unborn
    chid must be considered. He said that there was  no  authority  on  the
    point.

Oral evidence

17. The appellant gave oral evidence in  the  English  language,  which  he
    spoke fluently. An interpreter in the Arabic language was  at  hand  to
    assist if he required assistance which, in the event, he did not.

18. In examination-in-chief, the appellant said he, his wife and her family
    could not live together in Tunisia because his life  is  in  danger  in
    Tunisia.

19. I intervened to stop Mr Parkin asking questions about the nature of the
    relationship between L and her biological father  because  the  judge's
    finding that L has a close relationship  with  her  father  stands.  Mr
    Parkin informed me that, in that event, he did  not  have  any  further
    questions.

20. Mr Staunton did not have any questions in cross-examination.

21. In answer to my questions, the appellant said that he could not  return
    to Tunisia to make an entry clearance application because his  life  is
    in danger in Tunisia. He said that there were no other reasons  why  he
    could not return to Tunisia to make a entry clearance application.

22. Neither Mr Staunton nor Mr Parkin had any questions they wished to  put
    to the appellant arising from my questions.

23. Ms G gave evidence in  the  English  language,  which  she  spoke  very
    fluently.  In examination-in-chief, she said that she is  pregnant  and
    that the appellant is the father of the  chid  she  is  expecting.  The
    anticipated delivery date is 14 December  2015.  She  is  currently  on
    maternity leave.  Before going on maternity leave, she  worked  at  the
    Chocolate Factory, earning ï¿½13,000 gross a year.

24. It was put to her that the respondent had  suggested  that  she  and  L
    could live with the appellant in Tunisia. Ms G said that  she  did  not
    see herself moving to Tunisia and taking from her  daughter;  all  that
    she has in the UK. Her daughter was born in the  UK.  She  herself  has
    lived in the UK or 20 years, since she was 7 years old. The UK  is  her
    home. She said that there was no way that she could leave her  daughter
    behind and go to Tunisia with the appellant. Ms G said that there would
    be a huge impact on L of having to move to Tunisia to live. She has her
    friends in the UK. There was simply no way that she (Ms G)  could  take
    this away from L.

25. Mr Staunton did not have any questions in cross-examination.

26. I asked Ms G what she  would  decide  to  do  in  the  event  that  the
    appellant had to leave the UK upon having pursued all legal avenues and
    failed in  challenging  the  decision:  whether  she  would  decide  to
    relocate to Tunisia to enjoy family life with the appellant and if  so,
    whether she would go alone and leave L behind or whether she would take
    L with her; or whether she would remain in the UK with L. She said  she
    would have to stay with her daughter in the UK.

27. Neither Mr Staunton nor Mr Parkin had any questions they wished to  put
    to the appellant arising from my questions.

Submissions

28. Mr Staunton submitted that, in view of the evidence of Ms  G  that,  if
    the appellant is removed, she would  remain  in  the  UK  with  L,  the
    decision would not compel L to leave the UK and therefore  no  EEA  law
    issue arises.

29. Mr Staunton referred me to the Home Office guidance on the  meaning  of
    insurmountable obstacles, set out at para 24 of Iftikhar Ahmed  v  SSHD
    [2014] EWHC 300 (Admin).

30. In relation to the Article 8 claim outside the  Immigration  Rules,  Mr
    Staunton  submitted   that   the   appropriate   test   was   that   of
    exceptionality.  He  submitted   that   there   were   no   exceptional
    circumstances  in  this  case  because  the  relationship  between  the
    appellant and Ms G can continue even if the appellant were removed.  He
    could make an entry clearance application. Ms G and L can visit him  in
    the meantime. He does not have  a  parental  relationship  with  L.  He
    submitted that the  rights  of  an  unborn  child,  if  they  fell  for
    consideration,  were  limited  and  the  Tribunal  should   not   place
    significant weight upon those rights. Mr Staunton submitted that,  even
    if the appropriate test is whether there are compelling  circumstances,
    the decision was not disproportionate, for the  same  reasons.  On  the
    oral evidence of Ms G, L will continue to  maintain  contact  with  her
    biological parents. He submitted that s.117B(6) of the NIAA  2002  does
    not apply because the appellant does not have a  parental  relationship
    with L. However, he asked me to take  into  account  the  remainder  of
    s.117B.

31. Mr Parkin relied  upon  his  skeleton  argument.  In  relation  to  the
    question of "insurmountable obstacles" under EX.1, Mr Parkin  submitted
    that the fact that Ms G would not leave the UK in order to enjoy family
    life with the appellant if to do so would mean taking her daughter away
    from the UK was itself an insurmountable obstacle for the  purposes  of
    EX.1. Indeed, Mr Parkin submitted that the fact that Ms G would  remain
    in the UK if the appellant were to be removed was  a  very  significant
    obstacle to family life. Family life between the  appellant  and  Ms  G
    would effectively come to an end. The family  life  that  is  currently
    being enjoyed cannot be enjoyed in any country outside the UK.

32. Mr Parkin reminded me that the appellant  is  not  an  overstayer.  His
    family life was established when his immigration status was  precarious
    but  lawful.  His  spouse  cannot  meet  the  income  threshold  for  a
    successful application for entry clearance. Any application  for  entry
    clearance would be likely to fail or, at least could not be assumed  to
    be successful. He submitted that this was  relevant  to  the  issue  of
    proportionality  because  it  is  goes  to  the  question  whether  the
    separation will be short term or long term. He  reminded  me  that  the
    Court of Appeal in MF  (Nigeria)  v  SSHD  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192  had
    indicated that the test of "insurmountable obstacles" is wrong.

Assessment

33. I agree with Mr Staunton that, in view of Ms G's evidence that, if  the
    appellant had the leave the UK, she would remain in  the  UK  with  her
    daughter, no EEA law point arises because L would not be  compelled  to
    leave the UK, whatever the position as to whether she could  stay  with
    he biological father.

34. The judge's findings and reasoning are at paras 51-59 of his  decision,
    which were set out in my "error of law" decision. There is no  need  to
    repeat them but his findings continue to apply, except  those  findings
    which have been set aside and which are set out at my para 5 above.

35. I will first decide whether the appellant satisfies the requirements of
    EX.1(b). EX.1 and Ex.2 of Appendix FM which provide:

         EX.1. This paragraph applies if

         (a)      (i)  the applicant has a genuine and  subsisting  parental
                  relationship with a child who-

                  (aa) is under the age of 18 years, or was under the age of
                      18 years when the applicant was first  granted  leave
                      on the basis that this paragraph applied;

                  (bb) is in the UK;

                  (cc)  is  a  British  Citizen  or  has  lived  in  the  UK
                      continuously for at least  the  7  years  immediately
                      preceding the date of application; and

             (ii)      it would not be reasonable to expect  the  child  to
                  leave the UK; or

         (b)      the applicant has a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship
             with a partner who is in the UK  and  is  a  British  Citizen,
             settled in  the  UK  or  in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or
             humanitarian  protection,   and   there   are   insurmountable
             obstacles to family life with that partner continuing  outside
             the UK.

         EX.2.  For  the  purposes  of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  "insurmountable
         obstacles" means the very significant difficulties which  would  be
         faced by the applicant or their partner in continuing their  family
         life together outside the UK and which could  not  be  overcome  or
         would entail very serious  hardship  for  the  applicant  or  their
         partner.

36. It is plain, from paras 47-49 of the remarks in obiter of the Court  of
    Appeal's judgment in MF (Nigeria) that a higher  threshold  applies  in
    relation to "insurmountable obstacles" than the approach which  applies
    in Article 8 cases according to domestic and Strasbourg  jurisprudence.
    This issue was specifically considered by Sales J (as he then was) in R
    (on the application of Nagre) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin)  at  paras
    38-43. At para 43, Sales J said that, in cases not  involving  children
    where family life is established whilst a person's  immigration  status
    is precarious, the gap between the test of  "insurmountable  obstacles"
    under EX.1(b) and the  result  that  one  would  arrive  at  by  direct
    consideration of Article 8 is likely to be small.

37. In Mahad [2009] UKSC 16, the Supreme Court held  that  the  Immigration
    Rules were not to be construed strictly but sensibly in accordance with
    the normal meaning of  the  words  used;  the  question  was  what  the
    Secretary of State must have intended when she formulated the Rules. In
    my  view,  the  interpretation  of  the   requirement   "insurmountable
    obstacles" is not to be informed by the existence of  any  gap  between
    "insurmountable  obstacles"  under  EX.1(b)  and  the  result  that  is
    obtained by following the approach that  applies  in  Article  8  cases
    according to domestic and Strasbourg jurisprudence.  The  Secretary  of
    State is entitled to apply a more stringent  test  for  those  who  are
    granted leave to remain under the Immigration Rules than those who  are
    granted leave on the basis of Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.

38. However, even if I am wrong about this, the issue is entirely  academic
    in this particular case for the following reasons:

    i)     When asked why he could not live in Tunisia with  his  wife  and
         family, the appellant said that it was  because  his  life  was  in
         danger in Tunisia. However, his asylum claim was  rejected  by  the
         judge and he was refused permission to  appeal  that  part  of  the
         judge's decision. The appellant gave no other reasons for not being
         able to enjoy family life in Tunisia.

    ii)     In  any  event,  the  need  to   assess   whether   there   are
         insurmountable obstacles to family life being  enjoyed  in  Tunisia
         was rendered academic by Ms G's oral evidence before me.  She  said
         in oral evidence, that, if all legal avenues  for  challenging  the
         decision failed and the appellant had to leave the UK so  that  she
         is faced with having to decide whether to leave the UK to live with
         the appellant outside the UK with L or  without  L  or  whether  to
         remain in  the  UK  with  L  and  face  being  separated  from  the
         appellant, she said that she would decide to remain in the UK  with
         L. I accept her evidence and I find accordingly.

    iii)   In the light of that evidence, Mr Parkin submitted that the fact
         that Ms G would decide to remain in the UK with L and be  separated
         from the appellant  was  itself  an  "insurmountable  obstacle".  I
         reject this submission  without  hesitation.  Whatever  meaning  is
         given to the phrase "insurmountable obstacles"  when  one  assesses
         obstacles that are external  to  the  individual's  own  choice  or
         decision, I am certain that an individual's decision to  remain  in
         the UK cannot itself amount to an "insurmountable  obstacle".  Such
         an interpretation would make a nonsense of the requirement to  show
         insurmountable obstacles and open EX.1(b) to potential abuse.

    iv)    It follows that neither the appellant nor Ms G gave any evidence
         of  there  being  any  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family   life
         continuing with each other outside the UK.

39.  Accordingly,  I  find  that  the  appellant  does  not   satisfy   the
    requirements of EX.1(b). I therefore  dismiss  his  appeals  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

40. Before I turn to consider the Article 8 claim outside  the  Immigration
    Rules, it is necessary for me to draw attention to the  fact  that  the
    judge did not  deal  with  EX.1(a).   Para  7  of  the  grounds  quoted
    s.117B(6) of the NIAA 2002 but the argument advanced at para 8  of  the
    grounds concerned the separation of L from her mother. The grounds  did
    not challenge the fact that  the  judge  did  not  decide  whether  the
    appellant satisfied EX.1(a). It was the  appellant's  case  before  the
    judge that it would be unreasonable to expect L to  leave  the  UK.  It
    follows that it was not suggested to the judge that the appellant had a
    parental relationship with L.

41. At the "error of law" hearing, Mr Wilding submitted that EX.1(a)  could
    not apply because the exception in EX.1(a) could only apply if a person
    has a parental relationship with a child. He drew my attention  to  the
    fact that the judge had not made a finding that the appellant enjoyed a
    parental relationship with L.

42. At the "error of law" hearing, Mr Parkin did not  take  issue  with  Mr
    Wilding's submission that, where a child enjoys family  life  with  its
    biological parents, it would be virtually impossible to show  that  the
    child also enjoyed a parental relationship with a  third  person;  that
    the  judge  did  not  find  that  the  appellant  enjoyed  a   parental
    relationship with L; and that, for these  reasons,  EX.1(a)  could  not
    apply. At the "error of law" hearing, Mr Parkin's challenge  under  the
    Immigration Rules was confined to the judge's finding that  there  were
    no insurmountable obstacles to family life between the appellant and Ms
    G continuing in Tunisia, i.e. EX.1(b).

43. It follows that it was not the appellant's case before the  judge  that
    he has a parental relationship with L. This was not in his grounds  nor
    was  it  part  of  his  case  at  the  "error  of  law"  hearing.  This
    notwithstanding the evidence of Ms G in her witness statement, that the
    appellant played a vital role in L's upbringing and that  L  considered
    him  like  her  father.  I  therefore  decide  the  claim  outside  the
    Immigration Rules on the basis that it is not the appellant's case that
    he has a parental relationship with L.

44. In any event, I find that he does not have a parental relationship with
    L. Her biological parents enjoy a parental relationship  with  her.  It
    would be unusual for a child to have a  parental  relationship  with  a
    third person. When I asked her what she would do if the  appellant  had
    to depart the UK, whether she would leave with him and, if so,  whether
    she would do so with L or without L, or whether she would remain in the
    UK, Ms G said she would have to remain with her daughter without saying
    that she would need to discuss the matter with  the  appellant.  It  is
    plain that the appellant does not have any input in the making  of  any
    important decisions that concern L and there was  no  evidence  of  him
    having any real input into her life such as would be consistent with an
    person enjoying a parental  relationship  with  a  child.  It  was  not
    suggested to me at any stage that he  enjoys  a  parental  relationship
    with L.

45. I turn to consider Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.

46. I will first consider the submissions as to the  applicable  test.  The
    appellant is not an overstayer. Although there is a distinction between
    immigration status that is unlawful  and  immigration  status  that  is
    precarious for the purposes of s.117B of the NIAA 2002  (AM  (Malawi)),
    the term "precarious" in Strasbourg  jurisprudence  relates  to  anyone
    whose presence is unlawful or who has a limit on the  period  of  their
    stay in the country in question. The  appellant  entered  the  UK  with
    leave as a visitor for six months.  Since  then,  his  leave  has  been
    extended under s.3C of the 1971 Act. Since  the  extension  is  of  the
    original leave, the extended  leave  is  leave  as  a  visitor.  It  is
    undoubtedly the case  that  his  immigration  status  has  always  been
    precarious, as that term is  understood  in  Strasbourg  jurisprudence.
    This was not in issue before me.

47. The answer to the question as to whether the  test  should  be  one  of
    exceptionality or of compelling circumstances depends on  whether  this
    is a case which involves children either on account of L or the  unborn
    child or both.

48. In my judgement, the rationale for applying the less stringent test  of
    compelling circumstances in cases involving children applies only where
    the claimant has a parental relationship with a child. Where there is a
    parental relationship, this will always amount to family life. However,
    the converse is not true. A  child  can  enjoy  family  life  with  the
    partner of a biological parent without that partner having  a  parental
    relationship with the child.

49. It is because of the existence of  a  parental  relationship  that  the
    state's interests carry less weight and the child's greater  weight  so
    that compelling circumstances will suffice.  Where  there  is  no  such
    parental relationship, the test of exceptionality applies. This  is  so
    whether the relationship that  is  short  of  a  parental  relationship
    amounts to family life or not or whether it  is  part  of  the  private
    lives of the adult and the child or children.

50. Given that the appellant does not have a parental relationship with  L,
    I do not accept that  this  is  a  precarious  family  life  case  that
    involves children on account of L. Nor does  the  fact  that  Ms  G  is
    pregnant and due to give birth shortly make this a case  in  which  the
    compelling circumstances test should be applied precisely  because  the
    child is not yet born. Thus, in my judgement, the  applicable  test  is
    that of exceptionality.

51. I find that the relationship between  the  appellant  and  L  does  not
    amount to family life (this was not suggested). Whilst L has only known
    the appellant for a short duration, the fact that the  relationship  is
    being enjoyed within the context of a stable relationship  between  her
    mother and her mother's partner means that the relationship between the
    appellant and L represents part of  the  appellant's  and  L's  private
    life. I find accordingly.

52. Beoku-Betts [2008] UKHL 39 does not apply until and unless family  life
    is found to exist (Etti-Adegbola v SSHD [2009] EWCA  Civ  1319).  Since
    family life is being enjoyed between the appellant and Ms G, her  human
    rights fall to be considered in line with Beoku-Betts. However, I  have
    taken into account L's human rights  as  concerns  the  impact  on  L's
    private life of being separated from the appellant.

53. Mr Parkin submitted that the best interests of the  appellant's  unborn
    child must be considered. He said that there was no  authority  on  the
    point. I do not accept that the best interests of an unborn child  fall
    to be considered in immigration cases. My decision and  reason  are  as
    brief as was Mr Parkin's submission on the point.

54. Mr Parkin submitted that the fact that Ms G cannot satisfy  the  income
    threshold means that, if the appellant were to  return  to  Tunisia  to
    make an entry clearance application, the separation will effectively be
    permanent. In effect, he was asking me to take into account the  likely
    outcome of any application for entry clearance. However, if the  income
    threshold is not satisfied, the appellant can apply to be granted entry
    clearance exceptionally outside the Immigration Rules on the  basis  of
    Article 8.  There is no reason to pre-suppose that any decision made on
    such an application will be  in  breach  of  Article  8.  Even  if  the
    application is refused, he will have a right to appeal.

55. Furthermore, in SB (Bangladesh) v SSHD [2007] EWCA Civ 28 the Court  of
    Appeal held, in essence, that an article 8 claim of a person  resisting
    removal is not  made  weaker  by  strong  prospects  of  success  in  a
    subsequent application for entry clearance; nor is it made stronger  by
    weak prospects in such an application.  The court  held  that  that  it
    would be proper for the Tribunal to exclude the  prospects  of  success
    altogether  when  assessing  the  proportionality  of   removal.   This
    reasoning was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in HC (Jamaica)  v  SSHD
    [2008] EWCA Civ 371 and in SZ (Zimbabwe) [2009] EWCA 590.

56. I therefore exclude from my consideration of the appellant's Article  8
    claim outside the Immigration Rules the likelihood  of  an  application
    for entry clearance being successful or unsuccessful. During the period
    that any entry clearance application is made, Ms G and L will  be  able
    to visit him in Tunisia. They will also be able to maintain contact  by
    telephone, email and Skype.

57. If the appellant leaves the  UK,  this  will  have  no  impact  on  the
    circumstances which are currently in place and which  currently  secure
    L's best interests. The only impact on L will be on her  private  life,
    that she will lose face-to-face daily  contact  with  her  step-father,
    with whom she does not enjoy a parental relationship or family life and
    who she has only known since February 2013 when the appellant and Ms  G
    met, i.e. a period of 2 ï¿½ years. L is now  9  years  8  months  old.  I
    accept that Ms G will be upset. However, she is plainly  devoted  to  L
    and I find that Ms G being upset on account of being separated from the
    appellant will not have any impact on L. In all of the circumstances, I
    find that the impact on L will be minimal.

58. The appellant's departure from the United Kingdom will  interfere  with
    the family life that is being enjoyed between the appellant and  Ms  G.
    Ms G will be without the  appellant  during  this  last  phase  of  her
    pregnancy. Set against  these  considerations  is  the  fact  that  the
    appellant and Ms G established their family life in the full  knowledge
    that the appellant's immigration status  is  precarious.   They  had  a
    child together knowing that he had lost his previous appeal. They could
    not have been assured of a successful outcome to  his  application  for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal or his appeal to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

59. Section 117B sets out a  list  of  factors  that  must  be  taken  into
    account. Section 117B(2) is in the  appellant's  favour  as  he  speaks
    English fluently. However, this does not give him a positive  right  to
    remain (AM (Malawi)), although it is a consideration in  the  balancing
    exercise. His private life established in the UK  whilst  he  has  been
    present as a visitor carries little weight (S.117B(5)).

60. On the whole of the  evidence,  and  having  given  such  weight  as  I
    consider appropriate to  each  of  the  factors  for  and  against  the
    appellant and to the state's interests in  the  balancing  exercise,  I
    have concluded that the decision would not disproportionately interfere
    with the protected rights of the appellant,  Ms  G  or  L  whether  the
    applicable test is that of exceptionality or the less stringent one  of
    compelling circumstances.

61. I therefore dismiss the appeals on human rights grounds.

    Decision

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that it was set aside. I  re-
    make  the  decision  by  dismissing  the  appeals  on  asylum  grounds,
    immigration grounds and on human rights grounds.
