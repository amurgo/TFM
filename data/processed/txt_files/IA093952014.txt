          DECISION AND REASONS FOR FINDING A MATERIAL ERROR OF LAW

Introduction

1.   The appellant, a citizen of Bangladesh, appeals to the  Upper  Tribunal
    with permission of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Nicholson given  on
    29 October 2014.

2.   The appellant came to the UK as a visitor in August 2013 but  not  long
    after arriving here met her husband, Mr U,  a  British  citizen.   They
    married on 7 January 2014 and have recently had  a  child  together,  a
    girl born on 1 November 2014.

3.   The Immigration Judge decided that although an application for  further
    leave to remain was made on the grounds  of  being  the  partner  of  a
    British national on a ten year route to settlement, it seems  that  the
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was allowed  solely  on  the  grounds
    that Article 8 of the European Convention on Human  Rights  (ECHR)  was
    engaged.   Accordingly,  the  Immigration  Judge   decided   that   the
    respondent's decision had been  unlawful  because  she  considered  the
    appellant would find it difficult to "self care" or  indeed  to  travel
    back to Bangladesh whether on her own or escorted by her husband.   She
    did not speak English well which was a factor the  judge  took  account
    of.  She also took account of the fact that the appellant was pregnant,
    although she could not determine the  nationality  of  the  child  when
    born.  She described the appellant and the sponsor as being "foolhardy"
    but having created a situation where the appellant is  likely  to  give
    birth to an English born child she concluded that it would be a  breach
    of their human rights to be returned to Bangladesh.

The Hearing

4.    At  the  hearing   both   representatives   made   submissions.    The
    respondent's representative, Mr Mills, pointed out that the application
    could not succeed under the Immigration Rules and had been  weak  under
    the ECHR.  The appellant had been here as a visitor  and  there  was  a
    strong public interest in ensuring  that  visitors  complied  with  the
    terms of their leave.  The appellant had chosen  to  completely  ignore
    those requirements, did not meet the income threshold required and  had
    been dependent on the NHS for medical treatment.  Even if the appellant
    had formed a private or family life in the UK it  would  be  reasonable
    for her to go back to Bangladesh, with her child if necessary.

5.   The appellant, on the other hand, submitted that the Immigration  Judge
    had looked at the Immigration Rules but concluded that the requirements
    were not met.  An additional point was that the appellant suffered from
    medical problems.  These  were  set  out  in  the  determination.   The
    circumstances were therefore sufficiently compelling to apply Article 8
    on a freestanding basis.  Some of  the  conclusions  were  accepted  as
    being "generous" but they were nevertheless open to the  Tribunal,  the
    decision being one the First-tier Tribunal was entitled to come to.

6.   It was then submitted on behalf of the respondent that it was  relevant
    to the application that the appellant spoke little or no English, could
    reasonably relocate to Bangladesh and the  appellant  and  her  husband
    were a long  way  short  of  meeting  the  maintenance  requirement  of
    ï¿½18,600.  It was further submitted on behalf of the respondent that the
    Immigration Judge had come to a decision not reasonably open to her  on
    the evidence and the proportionality of removal  was  proportionate  in
    all  the  circumstances.   The  respondent  indicated  that  given  the
    financial requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  were  not  met,  the
    appellant's use of the NHS was a factor properly to take into  account.
    The UK sponsor was from a Bangladeshi background and could go and  live
    with his wife in Bangladesh.

My Conclusions

7.   As I indicated to the parties at the hearing in  summary  form,  I  did
    not accept the appellant's submission that the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal was open to her on the evidence.

8.   The Immigration Act 2014 made important  changes  to  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  Specifically, it required a  Tribunal
    seized with determining a decision  under  the  Immigration  Act  where
    breaches of a person's right to respect for his private or family  life
    under Article 8  were  concerned,  to  have  regard  to  Section  117B.
    Section  117B  contains  a  number   of   important   public   interest
    considerations applicable to all cases.  These  include  having  regard
    to:

    (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration  control  in  the  public
         interest.


    (2)  The interests of economic well-being of the UK including the  need
         for immigrants to be able  to  speak  English  and  integrate  into
         society.


    (3)  The need for  persons  who  enter  or  remain  in  the  UK  to  be
         financially independent and not a burden on taxpayers.


    Section 117B (5) states that "little weight shall be given to a private
    life established by a person at a time when  the  person's  immigration
    status is precarious".


9.   It was submitted on behalf  of  the  respondent  that  the  Immigration
    Judge whilst setting out the requirements of the  2014  Act  failed  to
    have any, or any  adequate,  regard  to  the  public  interest  and  in
    particular the  public  interest  of  enforcing  effective  immigration
    control.  I agree with the respondent's submission that  the  appellant
    had  formed  a  family  life  in  full  knowledge  of  her   precarious
    immigration status and that the Immigration Judge failed to have regard
    to the fact that the appellant fell a long way  short  of  meeting  the
    maintenance  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  (see  paragraph
    276ADE).  The appellant had been in  the  UK  for  a  relatively  short
    period of time and had not in any way integrated into UK  society.   It
    was in my view a significant factor that she did not have a  reasonable
    command of  the  English  language.   Furthermore,  as  Mr  Mills  also
    submitted, the appellant and the sponsor's child had not been  born  at
    the date of the hearing.  I understand that the appellant's husband  is
    a British citizen who was born in the UK on 30 March 1984 but no  clear
    reasons were given why it would not be  reasonable  to  expect  him  to
    return to Bangladesh with the sponsor to  continue  their  family  life
    there.  Having found  that  the  appellant  had  been  "foolhardy"  the
    Immigration Judge should have gone on to ask herself why the  appellant
    should be allowed to avoid the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules.
    There was, in fact, no justifiable reason for the conclusion  that  the
    appellant could avoid the requirements of those rules.

10.  Accordingly, as I announced at the hearing, I find  that  there  was  a
    material error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and  I
    set aside that decision.  I proceed to re-make the decision.

11.  The only change of circumstances since the hearing which  my  attention
    has been drawn has been the birth of the child.  It is  true  that  the
    child is a British citizen but it is, of course, too  young  to  be  at
    school.  There is no suggestion that  the  financial  circumstances  of
    this couple have changed and no reason has been given why  the  sponsor
    cannot return to Bangladesh with his wife  if  that  is  desired.   The
    important public interest requirements as incorporated into the law  by
    the Immigration Act 2014 and applied to the facts of this case lead  to
    only one conclusion: that the appellant has not established  a  private
    or family life here of such quality that it would  be  unreasonable  to
    require her to return to Bangladesh.  The family  will  then  have  the
    option of continuing their family life there.  Mr Mustapha pointed  out
    that the requirements of Appendix FM do not  enable  the  appellant  to
    apply "for ten year" route in circumstances where she came to the UK as
    a visitor.  With respect, the Rules have been put  in  place  for  good
    reason but it may be in the future  that  the  sponsor  does  meet  the
    maintenance requirements of the Immigration Rules.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material error of law  so
that it is required to be set aside.

I re-make the decision which is to dismiss the  appellant's  appeal  against
the decision of the respondent to refuse further leave to remain.

The appellant was granted anonymity in these proceedings  and  no  challenge
to that order remaining in place has been made.

The First-tier Tribunal decided not to make a fee award  and  that  decision
also stands.
