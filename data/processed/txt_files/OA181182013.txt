                            DECISION AND REASONS


The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of India born  on  30th  July  1928  and  is
    therefore now aged 86 years.  She appealed against a  decision  of  the
    Respondent dated 21st August 2013 to refuse her entry clearance  as  an
    adult dependent relative of  her  son  Mr  Surender  Sandhu  a  British
    citizen who  has  been  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  38  years  ("the
    Sponsor"). The refusal was pursuant to Section EC - DR 1.1 of  Appendix
    FM  to  the  Immigration  Rules  which  states   that   the   following
    requirements must  be  met.  Section  E  ECDR  2.4  provides  that  the
    applicant must as a result of age, illness or disability require long -
    term personal  care  to  perform  everyday  tasks.  Sub  paragraph  2.5
    provides that the applicant must be unable even with the practical  and
    financial help of the Sponsor to obtain the required level of  care  in
    India because either (a) it was not available and there was  no  person
    in the country who could reasonably  provide  it  or  (b)  it  was  not
    affordable. The burden of proof  of  establishing  this  rests  on  the
    Appellant and the standard of proof is  the  usual  civil  standard  of
    balance of probabilities.

2.   Her appeal was allowed at first instance by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Colvin sitting at Taylor House on 19th  September  2014.   The
    Respondent appeals with leave against that decision.  The  matter  thus
    comes before me in the first place to decide whether there is an  error
    of law in the Judge's decision such that it falls to be set aside.  For
    the reasons which I set out below I did so decide  that  there  was  an
    error of law and proceeded to remake the decision.   For  the  sake  of
    convenience therefore I shall continue to refer to the parties as  they
    were known at first instance.

The Appellant's Case

3.   The Appellant's case was that she became a  widow  two  years  ago  and
    since then has been finding it  increasingly  difficult  to  carry  out
    daily tasks such as cooking, cleaning and bathing for herself.  She was
    unable to stand for more than a few minutes due  to  arthritis  of  the
    knees.  Being alone and the thought of being  alone  caused  her  great
    anxiety and she was suffering bouts of depression.  She was  completely
    dependent upon her son the Sponsor  for  her  financial,  physical  and
    mental wellbeing.  Her wish now was to spend her final years  with  her
    son and his family.

4.   The Sponsor who attended and  gave  oral  evidence  at  first  instance
    works for London Underground Limited as a  station  supervisor  earning
    approximately �40,000 per annum.  The  Appellant  would  have  her  own
    bedroom in his home.  The Sponsor has a brother in Canada who  is  said
    to have cut off all contact with the Appellant and she was thus  unable
    to reside with that son.  The Sponsor was  the  only  family  that  the
    Appellant had left.

5.   Care homes in the Appellant's area in India  were  situated  in  places
    where there was rubbish and where the sanitary  system  was  not  good.
    The Sponsor was told that one home in a neighbouring district was not a
    good place but had not made enquiries of anywhere else.   There  was  a
    lady who came to clean his mother's house in the mornings,  cooked  her
    food and gave her a bath.  This could continue but the Appellant  would
    need moral and emotional support.  When she was alone she had to  crawl
    to the toilet she could not walk on her own.  The  Sponsor  called  her
    every day to remind her to take her medicines.  He sent �100 per  month
    to his mother but he himself was retiring in eight months'  time.   The
    carer who came in to look after his mother was paid approximately �8 to
    �10 per month.

The Explanation for Refusal

6.   The Respondent refused  the  application  arguing  that  there  was  no
    evidence that the Appellant or the Sponsor had conducted investigations
    into medical facilities in New Delhi, India to explore  the  option  of
    the Appellant remaining in India.  The Respondent  was  satisfied  that
    there were cheap homes available in India.  The Appellant  was  already
    in receipt of medical care from the Rawat Medical Centre.  There was no
    obvious reason why this could  not  continue.   The  Appellant  was  in
    receipt of a widow's pension.  Although the Appellant had said that was
    not sufficient to cover her cost of living the Respondent was satisfied
    that the Sponsor was able to provide financial support.

The Proceedings at First Instance

7.   The Judge found that the Sponsor had been candid that the present  care
    arrangements for his mother could continue and could be increased.   He
    had not made enquiries of care homes other than visiting the outside of
    one in a neighbouring district.  On the  basis  of  that  evidence  the
    Judge held that the Appellant's circumstances meant she  did  not  fall
    within the section EC-DR and the appeal under the Immigration Rules was
    dismissed.

8.   The Judge went on to consider whether there were arguably good  grounds
    for saying that there were compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently
    recognised under the new Rules.  The  Judge  observed  that  under  the
    previous Immigration Rules paragraph 317,  the  Appellant  at  aged  86
    would only have needed to show she was financially dependent on her son
    and she had no close relatives in India who could  financially  support
    her.  The issue previously had been about financial dependency but  the
    new Rules brought in by Appendix FM were wider in its terms. The  adult
    dependant relative was now required to show that that they were in need
    of long term personal care which was not available or  unaffordable  in
    their own country.

9.   The Judge proceeded to allow the appeal on  the  basis  that  what  she
    referred to as "the new Rules" (which had been in force over two  years
    by the time she heard the appeal) did not make provision for  the  kind
    of dependency which the Appellant had on the Sponsor in this case.   It
    was in the Judge's view a compelling factor  particular  to  this  case
    that could not be assessed from within the Rules but  was  nevertheless
    at the core of an Article 8 claim.  Refusal to allow the  Appellant  to
    spend her remaining years in the care of the Sponsor would result in an
    unjustifiably harsh consequence for all the family members involved and
    therefore could not be considered to  be  proportionate.   In  a  brief
    reference to Section 117A to D  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 the Judge stated that this was so "even  having  regard
    to the public interest requirements included in the new part 5A of  the
    2002 Act".





The Onward Appeal

10.  The Respondent appealed this decision  making  two  main  points.   The
    first was that the Judge had failed to properly take into  account  the
    provisions of Section 117A to D of the  2002  Act  when  assessing  the
    proportionality of the decision under Article 8.  The second ground was
    that the Judge had failed to provide adequate reasons for finding  that
    the Appellant's circumstances were  either  compelling  or  exceptional
    such that the appeal should be allowed outside the Rules.  The  finding
    that  emotional  dependency  was  a  compelling  factor  was  based  on
    inadequate reasoning.  The Appellant and Sponsor  had  chosen  to  live
    apart and could continue to do so.   The  refusal  of  entry  clearance
    maintained the status quo it did not  interfere  with  family  life  as
    currently established.

11.  The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    Judge P J M Hollingworth on 26th November 2014.  In granting permission
    to appeal he wrote in concise terms:

         "An arguable error of law has arisen in respect to the way in which
         the Judge has dealt with  the  application  of  Section  117.   The
         reasoning in this context is arguably inadequate".

    There was no response to this grant of permission from the Appellant.

The Error of Law Submissions

12.  In oral submissions the Presenting Officer sought to rely on  the  case
    of McLarty [2014] UKUT 315.   Although  this  was  a  decision  on  the
    proportionality exercise in deportation appeals it  was  cited  by  the
    Respondent due to the observations made by the Upper  Tribunal  on  the
    meaning of the phrases "exceptional" and "compelling" in an  Article  8
    context.  The exceptional or unusual position of an  individual  was  a
    factor to be placed on  the  scales  and  weighed  against  the  public
    interest.  Thus the phrases were no more  than  a  part  of  the  wider
    weighing process.  In some cases the phrase exceptional  or  compelling
    was used to describe the end result, i.e.  that  the  position  of  the
    individual is exceptional or compelling because  having  weighed  their
    very unusual facts against the public interest  the  former  outweighed
    the latter.  Thus exceptional or compelling was the end result  of  the
    proportionality weighing process.

13.  The Judge in the instant case had paid only lip service to  the  public
    interest in assessing the proportionality of the interference.  It  had
    not been shown that care could not be arranged in India.  The effect of
    the change in the Rules was that it was not just a question of  finance
    or maintenance but also whether the Appellant required the care  of  UK
    based relatives.  The Judge had found it compelling that the Rules  had
    changed but that was not open to her.  The Rules were not  designed  to
    enable people to choose where to live.  Article  8  was  not  there  to
    facilitate that.  There was no lawful identification by  the  Judge  of
    compelling factors regardless of who would pay for the Appellant's  own
    care.

14.  In response Counsel argued  that  the  Respondent  had  identified  two
    grounds in her onward appeal.  The Judge had had regard to Section 117A
    to D and there was a requirement upon her to go through  117B  to  show
    that she  had  conducted  that  exercise.   Who  was  to  pay  for  the
    maintenance and accommodation of the Appellant was not an issue  to  be
    determined the only issue was the question of the Appellant's long term
    personal care.  The Appellant would not be a burden on the tax  payers.
    Even if the Judge was required to carry out  a  full  consideration  of
    Section 117B it would not have made any difference.

15.  The Judge went through a detailed  consideration  of  the  evidence  in
    this case and found an emotional dependency by the Appellant on her son
    in the United Kingdom.  These were compelling  circumstances.   Whether
    the Appellant's physical welfare would be catered for was  not  enough.
    The issue was not recognised within the Immigration Rules.  The Sponsor
    was asking for his elderly mother to come and spend the last period  of
    her life in the United Kingdom.  This was exceptionally compelling,  it
    was a rare situation.  The Sponsor had  showed  very  genuine  distress
    when giving evidence at first instance about the plight of his  mother.
    It was not in every case of a mother and adult  child  that  there  was
    such a high level of emotional dependence.

The Error of Law Decision

16.  I considered the grounds of appeal and the  oral  submissions  made  in
    this matter and concluded that there was a material error of law in the
    Judge's decision such that it fell to be set  aside  and  the  decision
    remade.  The Judge had allowed the appeal outside  the  Rules  but  had
    made no more than a passing reference to Section 117A to D of the  2002
    Act and had given no reasons  why  she  placed  little  weight  on  the
    considerations contained therein.  The Judge  appeared  to  be  heavily
    influenced by the fact that the present Rules did  not  allow  for  the
    position in which the Appellant and Sponsor found  themselves  in.   It
    was hard to see how that could be a significant factor that would weigh
    heavily in the proportionality  exercise.   It  was  not  open  to  the
    Tribunal to rewrite the Immigration Rules using Article 8.

17.  The Judge granting permission had  not  commented  either  way  on  the
    second ground raised by the Respondent that the First Instance Tribunal
    had inadequately reasoned why emotional dependency was found to be such
    a compelling factor that the appeal fell to be allowed.  That  the  law
    had changed since July 2012 could not be said to be  an  arguably  good
    ground for saying that this raised an Article 8 issue  of  itself.   It
    was difficult to see how it was a compelling factor that this case  did
    not succeed under the  post-July  2012  Rules.   I  therefore  set  the
    decision aside and  proceeded  to  rehear  the  matter  preserving  the
    Judge's record of the evidence given at the hearing at first instance.

The Substantive Re-hearing

18.  I heard evidence from the Sponsor who adopted  his  previous  evidence.
    When asked by his Counsel in examination-in-chief what he wished to add
    he reiterated that he was the only family member the Appellant had left
    who could look after her.  She did not want to go into a care home  and
    had said as much many times.  If she came  to  the  United  Kingdom  he
    could take her to the park, give her meals and his presence  would  add
    years on his mother's life.  There was no care for his  mother  at  the
    moment the cleaner came in in the morning.  His mother had  no  one  to
    talk to.  He himself was age 63 and when he had fallen ill with a  cold
    last week his wife was there to look after him.  However there  was  no
    one there to look after an 86 year old lady.  He would ring her in  the
    early hours of the morning to ensure that she was taking her  medicine.
    Whilst his father was alive his father and his mother  were  happy  but
    his father had died three years ago.  It was  then  that  his  mother's
    condition had deteriorated.  He would be the only person who would live
    in guilt if she died.

19.  In cross-examination he was asked why if  his  mother's  condition  had
    deteriorated since his father had died in 2011 it was only in June 2013
    that he had applied for his  mother  to  come  to  this  country.   The
    Sponsor replied that his mother was coming to terms with her loss.   He
    had not taken his mother to  a  doctor  in  India  to  have  depression
    formally diagnosed.  She had lived in New Delhi for the last fifteen to
    seventeen years in a flat. There were people living  in  the  area  but
    they minded their own business.  The Sponsor was asked whether  if  his
    mother came to the United Kingdom and  had  problems  with  her  health
    would she avail herself of the services of the National Health Service?
     The Sponsor did not answer the question replying instead that  he  had
    been buying medicines for her.  The point had to be put to the  Sponsor
    five times before finally he replied "If she can use it yes  I'm  there
    for her". His mother had no contact with his, the Sponsor's brother her
    other son.  Her late husband had got on well with the older brother but
    the older brother had never got on with his mother the Appellant.

20.  In re-examination the Sponsor stated that the Appellant was  continuing
    to receive her husband's pension which would continue whether  she  was
    in India or the United Kingdom.  If his mother could use  the  NHS  "we
    will do that".  If he could afford  the  medical  care  he  would.   At
    retirement he would receive a company pension from London  Underground.
    His wife had retired some time ago she was now receiving a pension from
    British Airways.  There was no mortgage on his property.  He  had  made
    no enquiries for the cost of private healthcare.

Closing Submissions

21.  In closing for the Respondent it was argued that the  Rules  did  allow
    for people to enter  as  dependent  adult  relatives  if  there  was  a
    particular dependency and their needs could not be met.   It  was  said
    that the Appellant had depression but there was no medical evidence  to
    support that.  If the Appellant was suffering from  depression  medical
    evidence could have been supplied.  Her wellbeing could be  dealt  with
    in India.  The Appellant had lost her husband and  was  suffering  from
    arthritis.  She wanted to be with her family  but  the  Rules  did  not
    allow for that.  The emotional connection she had to  her  son  in  the
    United Kingdom  did  not  come  close  to  a  compelling  circumstance.
    Article 8 was not designed for people to pick and choose where to enjoy
    their family life.  The Sponsor had not considered what  the  financial
    consequences would be of treatment for  the  Appellant  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  The reality was that the Appellant would seek National Health
    Service care for arthritis and  other  related  ailments.   That  would
    weigh against the Appellant.

22.  In closing for the  Appellant  it  was  argued  that  there  were  very
    compelling circumstances in this case which were not recognised by  the
    Immigration Rules which looked  solely  at  the  circumstances  of  the
    country in which the Appellant was living.  That was  an  exceptionally
    high bar  and  did  not  take  account  of  the  Appellant's  emotional
    wellbeing.  The Sponsor had given evidence of that  today  and  at  the
    previous hearing.  It was a very compelling situation.   The  Appellant
    was at the very end of her life, one could  not  say  whether  she  had
    years or months to live.  In any  event  it  was  not  going  to  be  a
    particularly long time.  The Appellant had been happy living  in  India
    with all the support she needed but since the death of her husband  she
    had not had that.  Whilst there was no official  medical  diagnosis  of
    depression there was evidence from both the Appellant and  the  Sponsor
    that the Appellant was suffering from depression.

23.  The Sponsor was emotionally upset at the separation  from  his  mother.
    The care which the Sponsor could provide for the Appellant could  never
    be equalled by someone who was hired to provide  care.   It  could  not
    match the mother and son relationship.  There  had  been  a  change  in
    circumstances namely the death of the Appellant's husband which had had
    a significant impact on her.  The  only  factor  weighing  against  the
    Appellant in the balancing exercise was the  cost  of  the  Appellant's
    care in the United Kingdom.  The Sponsor would be willing  to  pay  for
    that care if he could afford to.  He was earning �40,000 per annum  and
    was entitled to a pension when he retired.  He currently sent �100  per
    month to India.  He was paying for medical care  there.   He  would  be
    able to afford care in the United Kingdom.  In any event  the  cost  of
    care was not an issue which the Entry Clearance Officer had  raised  as
    he was of the view that care could be provided in  India.   The  appeal
    should be allowed.

Findings

24.  There was no cross appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  that
    she could  not  come  within  Section  EC-DR  of  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The issue in this case  therefore  is  whether  the
    Appellant should succeed  outside  the  Immigration  Rules.   There  is
    clearly family life between a mother and  her  son  even  if  both  are
    adults aged 86 and 63 respectively.  It is difficult  to  see  in  this
    case however how that relationship can be  said  to  go  beyond  normal
    emotional ties.  I have no doubt that the Sponsor  is  concerned  about
    his mother.  He gave emotional evidence to the Judge at first  instance
    and made clear in his evidence to me the level of his concern.   Whilst
    it is possible to have a degree of sympathy for the position  in  which
    the Appellant  and  Sponsor  find  themselves,  the  desire  which  the
    Appellant and Sponsor have to live in the same household in the  United
    Kingdom does not establish a kind of dependency emotional or  otherwise
    which takes this case beyond normal emotional ties.

25.  The parties chose to live their lives in  two  separate  locations  and
    Article 8 is not there to be used by parties to enable them  to  choose
    where to enjoy their family or private lives.  Where the  parties  have
    chosen to live separately the  burden  upon  this  country  to  promote
    family life between them is necessarily reduced.

26.  Family life could be continued elsewhere.  Even if the Sponsor did  not
    wish to relocate to India given his family  and  other  connections  to
    this country, the evidence before the Judge at first instance was  that
    adequate care arrangements could be made for the Appellant in India and
    indeed were being made at the present time.  Someone was  going  in  to
    assist the Appellant with her daily needs.   That  was  why  the  Judge
    dismissed the appeal under the Rules. Whilst  therefore  it  is  a  low
    threshold to engage  Article  8,  it  is  difficult  to  see  what  the
    interference is with established rights which is being  caused  in  the
    present case by the exclusion of the Appellant from the United Kingdom.
     It is simply as the Respondent puts it a preservation  of  the  status
    quo.

27.  To the extent that there is  any  interference  with  the  relationship
    between the Appellant and the Sponsor that interference is pursuant  to
    the legitimate aim of immigration control, particularly given the  fact
    that the Appellant would need  to  use  the  public  resources  of  the
    National Health Service for her health needs.  The  Sponsor's  evidence
    after some hesitation was that if the Appellant could use the  National
    Health Service she would. She would thus potentially be a burden on the
    tax payer such that the economic wellbeing of the country would be  the
    legitimate aim being pursued in this case.

28.  Even if the Appellant and Sponsor could show there was an  interference
    in their family life I  do  not  find  that  they  could  show  it  was
    disproportionate.  Matters would continue as they are at present.   The
    Sponsor would continue to send money to  his  mother  to  pay  for  the
    person who comes in to look  after  her.   They  would  maintain  their
    communication and the Sponsor would have the  option  of  visiting  the
    Appellant.  That the Appellant could not meet the Immigration Rules  is
    a relevant factor because it means that the Tribunal  must  proceed  to
    look to see whether there are compelling or compassionate circumstances
    in the case to allow the  appeal  outside  the  Rules.   It  is  not  a
    compelling or compassionate factor that the Rules  are  such  that  the
    Appellant cannot meet them.  Where the Appellant's care needs are being
    met by the provision of someone who goes into the Appellant's  property
    there are no such compelling or compassionate factors. Refusal  of  the
    application by the Respondent was merely the preservation of the status
    quo. The end result is  not  unjustifiably  harsh.   It  would  not  be
    disproportionate to interfere in the family life of the  Appellant  and
    Sponsor by dismissing the Appellant's appeal against  the  Respondent's
    decision.  I dismiss the Appellant's appeal.
