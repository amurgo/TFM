                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                                DETERMINATION



   1. On 24 June 2013 I considered an application for permission  to  appeal
      to the Upper Tribunal. I found that the Judge in  the  First-tier  had
      made no arguable error  of  law  in  his  determination  when  he  had
      considered the merits of the appellant's claim to asylum but  that  it
      was arguable that he  should  have  allowed  the  appeal  against  the
      decision of the respondent to issue removal directions  under  section
      47 of the Immigration, Nationality and Asylum Act 2006.


   2. I directed that unless I received submissions to the  contrary  within
      14 days I would substitute for the decision of  the  judge  dismissing
      the asylum appeal a decision  to  dismiss  the  asylum  appeal  and  a
      decision to allow the appeal against  the  decision  to  remove  under
      Section 47. There being no response to the directions I  now make  the
      following  decision:


 Decision
This appeal is dismissed on asylum grounds.
This appeal is against the decision to remove under Section 47 is allowed.





Signed                                  Date: 4 September 2013
