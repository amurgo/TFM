For the appellant:     None
For the respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The  appellant  has  appealed  against  a  decision  of  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge Lenier dated 23 June 2015 in which  the  appellant's
         appeal against the refusal to grant entry clearance as a spouse was
         dismissed under the Immigration Rules and under Article  8  of  the
         ECHR.

      2. The appellant was not represented at the hearing but his solicitors
         submitted  written  representations  on  his  behalf.   Mr  McVeety
         indicated that  since  preparing  the  rule  24  response,  further
         consideration had been given to the case such that he invited me to
         allow the appeal and  to  re-make  the  decision  by  allowing  the
         appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules.

      3. I am satisfied that this is the  correct  course  to  follow.   The
         judge erred in law in focusing upon whether the relevant pay  slips
         had been sent with the appellant's application for entry clearance.
          As Mr McVeety pointed  out,  the  real  issue  for  the  judge  to
         determine was  whether  there  was  sufficient  specified  evidence
         available to the judge appertaining to the date of  decision.   The
         relevant pay  slips  appertaining  to  the  date  of  decision  and
         compliant with Appendix FM-SE were available to the judge and there
         was an error of law in failing to consider these.

      4. I am therefore satisfied that the judge has  committed  a  material
         error of law.  Of course the judge was not assisted  in  this  case
         because  as  he  observed  the  evidence  was  bulky   and   rather
         unmanageable.  The matter was determined on the papers and  without
         the benefit of oral submissions.

      5. I am also satisfied that I should accept Mr McVeety's invitation to
         remake the decision and allow  the  appeal.   As  at  the  date  of
         decision the appellant has demonstrated by reference  to  specified
         evidence that the sponsor had  the  following  income:  �15,568  in
         wages and �4000  in  rental  income.   This  exceeds  the  relevant
         threshold  of  �18600.   As  the  issue  of  meeting  the  relevant
         financial requirements was the only matter in dispute  and  is  now
         accepted by the SSHD, it follows that the appeal must be allowed.

Decision

      6. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  a
         material error of law and is set aside.

      7. I remake the  decision  by  allowing  the  appellant's  appeal  and
         directing that entry clearance shall be granted.


Signed:

Ms M. Plimmer
Judge of the Upper Tribunal
