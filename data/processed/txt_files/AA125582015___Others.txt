Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Wood, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I extend the anonymity order previously ordered in this appeal.

 2. Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise  the  appellants
    are granted anonymity. No report of these proceedings shall directly or
    indirectly identify the appellants or any member of their family.  This
    direction applies to amongst others, the appellants and the respondent.
    Failure to comply with this direction could lead to contempt  of  court
    proceedings.

 3. The appellants are Sri  Lankan  nationals.  The  first-named  appellant
    entered the United Kingdom as a student  and  was  accompanied  by  the
    second and third-named appellants.  Since  being  here  the  third  and
    fourth named appellants  have  been  born.  The  first-named  appellant
    claimed asylum on behalf of himself and  his  family  on  September  3,
    2014. The respondent refused his application.

 4. The appellant lodged grounds of  appeal  under  Section  82(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  His appeal  came  before
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Brookfield  (hereinafter  called  "the
    Judge") on May 17, 2016 and in a decision promulgated on May  22,  2016
    the Judge refused his appeal on all grounds.

 5. The appellant appealed the decision on June  10,  2016.  Permission  to
    appeal was refused by by Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Landes  on
    August 24, 2016. Permission to appeal was renewed  and  Upper  Tribunal
    McWilliam gave permission to appeal on October 5, 2016. The substantive
    hearing was before Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce on March 1, 2017 and in a
    decision promulgated on March 29, 2017 she upheld the Judge's decision.



 6. The appellant then lodged grounds seeking permission to appeal  to  the
    Court of Appeal. Vice President Ockelton considered the grounds and  in
    a decision promulgated on July 12, 2017 he  set  aside  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Bruce's decision. The grounds argued that the  respondent  failed
    to follow guidance in UB (Sri Lanka) v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 85.

 7. The matter has since been listed on two occasions but for  reasons  set
    out on the court file the case was adjourned both on September 14, 2017
    and November 28, 2017.

 8. The matter came before me on  the  above  date  and  the  parties  were
    represented as set out above.

    FINDINGS ON THE ERROR IN LAW

 9. Mr McVeety agreed that there was an error in law. The  decision  of  UB
    placed a duty on the respondent to place before  the  Tribunal  current
    policy, relevant evidence and guidance. This had not been done and  the
    importance of the documents, that were not presented, meant  the  Judge
    did not have the latest  information  before  her  when  she  made  her
    decision. He also accepted the Judge had referred herself independently
    to an out of date report that was not before  her.  As  findings  would
    need to be made afresh he submitted the appeal should  be  remitted  to
    the First-tier.

10. Mr Wood had recently taken over conduct of this appeal  and  he  agreed
    with the proposed course of action.

11. It should be noted that the only file that needs to be listed  in  this
    appeal is the first-named appellant's appeal (AA/12558/2015).  None  of
    the other files contain a decision that  attracts  a  right  of  appeal
    albeit they are dependants on the main appeal.

    DECISION

12. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.  I  set  aside  the  decision.  I
    remit the decision to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard  by  a  Judge
    other than Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Brookfield.


Signed                              Date     06/02/2018
