                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This was an appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge J M Holmes,  promulgated  on  26th  November  2012,  following  a
    hearing at North Shields on 13th November 2012.  In the  determination,
    the judge dismissed the appeal  of  MD  Khaled  Ahmed.   The  Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who was born  on  5th  January
    1982.  He appeals against a decision of the Entry Clearance Officer  to
    refuse his application to make a family visit on 15th March, under  the
    Immigration Appeals (Family Visitor) Regulations 2012, and the decision
    appealed against is dated 28th March 2012.

 3. The appeal before Judge Holmes was  specifically  on  the  basis  of  a
    "paper appeal" without a hearing.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge noted how the Appellant claimed in his VAF that he enjoyed  a
    net monthly income after tax of some ï¿½515,  but  the  Respondent  Entry
    Clearance Officer had decided that there was no reliable evidence  that
    demonstrated this level of income.  Indeed, the  content  of  the  bank
    statements provided for a bank account operated by  the  Appellant  was
    not consistent with this claimed income (see paragraph 5).  In response
    to this refusal, the Appellant  provided  an  income  tax  certificate,
    which he said was a genuine copy.

 5. However, "This document lacks a unique business  identification  number
    that it would bear if it was genuine, so I am not satisfied that I  can
    place any significant weight upon its existence or content"  (paragraph
    6), according to the judge.  The judge also held that the Appellant had
    not produced a copy of a proper tax  return  "That  he  ought  to  have
    submitted to the tax authorities, and which would have recorded  income
    that he had disclosed to them" (paragraph 7).

 6. Accordingly, the judge was  not  satisfied  that  the  bank  statements
    relied upon demonstrated the net level of income as claimed.  The judge
    gave additional reasons at paragraph 8.

Grounds of Application

 7. In detailed grounds of application, the Appellant states that the judge
    did not  consider  some  of  the  documents,  did  not  consider  other
    documents properly, and failed to understand that the appellant  was  a
    small trader in Bangladesh.

 8. On 18th July 2014 permission to appeal was granted on the  basis  of  a
    possible error of law.

 9. On 30th July 2014 a Rule 24 response was entered by  the  Appellant  to
    the effect that the detailed Grounds of Appeal amount to no more than a
    lengthy disagreement with the determination of the  judge.   The  Entry
    Clearance  Officer  had  provided  clear  reasons  for   refusing   the
    application and the ECM on review had provided further reasons.

10. It was the Appellant's decision to ask for a "paper  hearing"  and  the
    effect of this was that, "With all the inherent limitations in  respect
    of testing evidence or dealing with the issues raised" was visited upon
    the Appellant.

Submissions

11. At the hearing before me on 19th February  2015,  Mr  Aref  Ahmed,  the
    Sponsor, attended to assist the court.  He explained that the Appellant
    was his first cousin.  He said that he sponsored the Appellant on  10th
    February 2012.  His application was refused on  28th  March  2012.   He
    appealed against that decision and this was refused by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge on 26th November  2012.   He  made  an  application  for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal that  was  granted  on  18th
    July 2014.

12. This is a background to his attendance at the hearing on 19th  February
    2015.  He said that he was willing and able to maintain and accommodate
    the Appellant at his residence during his  short  stay  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  He said that he had  supporting  documentation  such  as  his
    earnings and his P60 to confirm this.

13. In reply, Mr Mills relied upon the Rule 24 response.  He said that  the
    judge could not be criticised  for  rejecting  the  evidence  that  was
    before him.  The notarised evidence was not  authenticated.   The  bank
    statement did not match the funds claimed in the Appellant's possession
    from earnings.  The income tax certificate was not matched by an income
    tax return.  Had the Appellant not asked for a "paper hearing" and  had
    an explanation been provided, it may have been possible  to  show  that
    the findings of the judge were unwarranted.  In the event, there was no
    basis for this.  This was simply a disagreement with the determination.

14. In reply, Mr Aref Ahmed submitted  that  the  Appellant  had  deposited
    money in his account  and  this  evidence  was  properly  authenticated
    before the judge, and it was overlooked.

15. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.  Mr  Aref  Ahmed,
    who has attended court to try and assist with the appeal of his cousin,
    has focused almost entirely upon his own position, in maintaining  that
    he would be able to accommodate and provide for  the  Appellant  if  he
    were to come to the UK.  He has drawn attention to his P60 and  to  his
    earnings.  However, this is not the issue.

16. The issue is the standing of the Appellant in  Bangladesh.   The  judge
    gave proper reasons for rejecting  the  evidence  that  he  did,  after
    referring specifically to  the  basis  of  the  refusal  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer, and giving a clear explanation as to  why  the  bank
    statements could not be relied upon, the tax certificate could  not  be
    depended upon and why the statements covering only a  short  period  of
    two months were inadequate (see paragraph 8).

17. The judge had to make his findings within the constrained circumstances
    of a "paper hearing" and this was the direct result  of  the  Appellant
    himself asking for a hearing other than one that was an oral hearing.

18. There is no error of law in the judge's findings.

Notice of Decision

19. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
