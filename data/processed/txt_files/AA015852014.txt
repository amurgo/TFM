Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Caskie, Advocate, instructed by Latta & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge McGrade, dismissing his appeal on asylum grounds and allowing  it
    (on a limited basis) on human rights grounds.

 2. The appellant is a Sunni Arab from Baghdad who was found to be at  risk
    in Baghdad.  There was evidence before the Judge on 24 June 2014  of  a
    rapidly changing situation in Iraq, including an IRIN report  dated  12
    June 2014 on the surge by ISIS and the flight of half a million  people
    towards Iraqi Kurdistan.

 3. In course of submissions it came to be conceded that the  Judge  failed
    to  explain  sufficiently  the  conclusion  that  internal  flight  was
    available, and that events were moving so swiftly that even by the time
    of signing off the determination on 7 July  2014  it  would  have  been
    appropriate to reconvene the hearing.

 4. It became common ground that in light of  the  individual  findings  of
    fact in the First-tier Tribunal and of the information before the Upper
    Tribunal, including the respondent's Country Information and Guidance -
    Iraq: Internal relocation (and technical obstacles), 24  December  2014
    (particularly at paragraphs 1.3.60-61 and  2.5.13-15,  and  the  policy
    summary at 1.4) the decision fell to be remade as follows.

 5. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal, in so far as it dismissed
    the appeal on asylum grounds, is set aside.  The appeal, as  originally
    brought to the  First-tier  Tribunal,  is  allowed  under  the  Refugee
    Convention.

 6. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
