Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Read, Counsel instructed by Caulker and Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a national of  Germany  whose  date  of  birth  is  13
    February 1965.  He appeals against the decision of Judge of the  First-
    tier Tribunal E M Simpson who, in a decision promulgated on  8  January
    2016, dismissed his appeal against  the  respondent's  decision  of  15
    April  2014  to  make  a  deportation  order  against  him  under   the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (hereinafter 'the
    2006 Regulations').

Background

2.   The appellant was born in Nigeria. He travelled to Germany in the  mid-
    1990s where he studied and worked  for  over  seventeen  years  and  he
    became a German citizen.  He was joined by his wife, whom he married in
    Nigeria on 4 June 2004. They have three children who were all  born  in
    Germany and are all German nationals. The appellant's  family  came  to
    the UK in September 2009 and the appellant followed them in March 2010.



3.   On 18 January 2011 the appellant was discovered smuggling cocaine  into
    the UK.  He had within him 77 packages containing 780 grams of  cocaine
    of 100% purity.  This was estimated to have a street value of ï¿½250,000.
    He pleaded guilty to being knowingly concerned in  "fraudulent  evasion
    of prohibition or restriction on importation of a  Class  A  controlled
    drug" and on 28 March 2011, he received a six and a  half  year  prison
    sentence.

4.   The respondent decided to deport the appellant pursuant  to  Regulation
    19 of the 2006 Regulations. In her decision the  respondent  considered
    the factors in Regulation 21(5), the circumstances and the  seriousness
    of the offence and the  probation  officer's  findings  on  risk.   The
    Secretary of State was of the view that it was  appropriate  to  deport
    the appellant.  He appealed the respondent's decision

First-tier Tribunal decision

5.   At his appeal hearing on 19 August 2015 the judge heard  oral  evidence
    from the appellant  and  his  wife.  In  her  decision  the  First-tier
    Tribunal set out the  judge's  sentencing  remarks  and  the  probation
    report dated 11 July 2013. The First-tier Tribunal judge identified and
    considered the documents that had  been  provided  in  support  of  the
    appellant's appeal and  made  reference  to  the  statements  from  the
    appellant and his wife as well as the oral  evidence  they  gave.   The
    judge then set out the legal framework  and  relevant  authorities  and
    made her findings.

6.   At paragraph 68 et seq  of  her  decision  the  judge  found  that  the
    explanation given by the appellant in his oral evidence relating to his
    involvement in  the  offence  was  different  to  any  account  he  had
    previously given. In essence, the appellant claimed that  he  had  been
    coerced into bringing the cocaine  to  the  UK  by  a  person  who  was
    formerly a business partner or friend of his brother  in  Nigeria.  The
    appellant claimed that his brother had been killed by  this  person  in
    October 2010 (there was no documentary  evidence  in  support  of  this
    assertion). The  appellant  had  been  contacted  by  this  person  who
    pressurised him in relation to money his brother was said to have owed.
    The appellant described how he was  threatened  with  death  unless  he
    swallow the drugs and took them across the border and into the UK.  The
    judge noted that this account had only been alluded to in the  briefest
    of terms  in  the  probation  report.  The  judge  concluded  that  the
    appellant  was  effectively  trying  to  run  an  appeal  against   his
    conviction. The judge concluded  that  the  account  presented  by  the
    appellant was an attempt to absolve him of culpability and to  diminish
    his responsibility for the criminal offence.

7.   The judge then turned to  the  legal  framework  and  the  question  of
    whether the appellant posed a genuine, present and sufficiently serious
    threat to society. At paragraph 81(ii) the judge stated:

         "I do not consider that there was a shred of evidence to show  that
         the Appellant had been the vulnerable party in  the  story,  rather
         that the background was financial  gain,  plainly  and  simply  his
         financial gain, and for a mature educated man of 46 years  entirely
         absent of any humane or practical regard for  the  consequences  of
         his actions not only upon members of the public but also his  three
         young children.  Notwithstanding it appeared that it was his  first
         offence, the offender manager acknowledging that  he  had  not  had
         information concerning the Appellant's history in  Germany,  having
         regard to what I found to be essentially his lack  of  remorse  and
         responsibility for his criminal conduct, against a background of  a
         real lack of information from  him  concerning  his  financial  and
         personal circumstances in the UK and his conduct during his  period
         on licence, of which I found that there was shown real risk of harm
         if facing financial and like difficulties."


     The judge concluded that the appellant, by his conduct and  explanation
    at the hearing, did  represent  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
    serious threat to the fundamental interests of society.

8.   The judge  went  on  to  consider  the  issue  of  proportionality  and
    concluded, having holistic regard to her findings and to  the  evidence
    presented to her, that the decision to  remove  the  appellant  was  in
    accordance with the EEA Regulations and was lawful.

9.   The judge then briefly considered  (at  paragraph  83)  the  Article  8
    aspect of the claim by making reference to her earlier findings and the
    decision in Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27.  The  judge  concluded  that  the
    decision to deport the appellant did not breach Article 8 and dismissed
    the appeal.

The grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal

10.  The grounds submitted that the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  failed  to
    make a definitive finding in relation to whether there  was  a  present
    risk of re-offending. This was relevant to whether the appellant  posed
    a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat. The basis  of  this
    ground stems from a probation report which concluded that the appellant
    was at low risk of serious harm. The grounds contended, with particular
    reference to the last sentence in paragraph 81(ii) as replicated above,
    that it was unclear whether the judge was making a finding of  risk  of
    harm at the date the appellant was sentenced or  at  the  date  of  the
    hearing and it was difficult to see how the judge could have arrived at
    a conclusion opposite to that of the probation service.

11.  A second ground contended that the judge was not entitled  to  question
    the appellant's culpability for  his  past  offending.  This  was  with
    reference to paragraph 76 of the First-tier  Tribunal's  decision.   It
    was submitted that, in effect, the appellant was being punished twice.

12.  The third  ground  briefly  stated  was  that  the  judge's  Article  8
    consideration was  insufficient  as  a  result  of  the  aforementioned
    errors.

The grant of permission

13.  Permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Smith.  She stated:

         "The main complaint in the grounds relates to the  judge's  finding
         that the appellant is a 'genuine, present and sufficiently  serious
         threat' to the UK. In  finding  that  he  is  at  [81](ii)  of  the
         decision it is arguable that the judge has erred in failing to take
         into account the OASys Report. Although the  judge  has  considered
         that report at paragraphs [6] to [14] it is arguable that  she  has
         failed to make any findings about it, whether she  agrees  with  it
         and to  explain  how  that  report  fits  into  her  assessment  at
         paragraph [81] and/or why she was departing from  the  findings  of
         that report as to risk."


     Upper Tribunal Judge Smith was less impressed by the other two  grounds
    but nevertheless granted permission on all grounds.

The error of law hearing

14.  At the outset of the hearing Mr Read sought to  amend  his  grounds  of
    appeal. He contended that the probation document before the  judge  was
    not in fact an OASys Report but was a normal probation  service  report
    prepared on behalf of the Home Office. It was contended that the  judge
    mistakenly relied on that report as  an  OASys  Report  and  that  this
    demonstrated a degree of carelessness which infected her assessment. It
    was further contended that the judge inappropriately  drew  an  adverse
    inference against the appellant on the basis that he failed to  provide
    an up-to-date report when it was the duty of the respondent to  provide
    the OASys Report. The application was resisted by Mr Avery.

15.  I refused the application to amend the  grounds.  The  application  was
    made at the very last minute.  There was no reasonable  explanation  as
    to why the challenge could not have  been  made  at  an  earlier  time.
    Moreover, this was a point that could have been raised  at  the  appeal
    hearing before the First-tier Tribunal.  It was not raised, nor was  it
    raised in the Grounds of Appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  In  any  event,
    regardless of the nomenclature of the report, it  was  clear  that  the
    judge was entitled to rely on its  contents.  Nor  was  there  anything
    preventing the Applicant from commissioning  an  independent  probation
    report if he so wished.

16.  Mr Read expanded upon the existing substantive  grounds.  He  submitted
    that the First-tier Tribunal failed to make a clear finding in  respect
    of any  risk  of  recidivism.  It  was  submitted  that  there  was  no
    assessment of the actual risk posed by the  appellant  and  no  reasons
    were given by the judge for departing from the conclusions as  to  risk
    reached in  the  probation  report.  Mr  Read  sought  to  rely  on  an
    unreported Upper Tribunal decision but I was not satisfied  that  there
    was any point of principle contained in that decision which would  have
    assisted the Tribunal and, as Mr Read accepted, he sought to adduce the
    decision for illustrative purposes. Nor did he comply with the Practice
    Direction for the citation of unreported decisions. Mr  Read  submitted
    that the issue in play was whether justice had been seen to be done. He
    additionally submitted that the judge's  reference  to  'financial  and
    personal circumstances' at paragraph 81(ii) failed to take into account
    the  appellant's  actual  circumstances.  It  was  submitted  that  the
    appellant had not offended whilst he was on licence and that he entered
    employment and continued to be in employment up  to  the  date  of  the
    hearing.

17.  Mr Read then moved on to his Article 8 submissions. He  submitted  that
    the judge failed to give consideration to section 55  of  the  Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration Act, that there had been  no  consideration
    of the requisite case  law,  and  that  the  judge  was  wrong  in  her
    proportionality assessment.

18.  Mr Avery gave a brief reply and, in turn, Mr Read  submitted  that  the
    judge was not entitled to go behind the sentencing judge's comments  in
    respect of remorse or the seriousness of the offending.

Discussion

19.  It is clear from the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  at  paragraph  68
    onwards that the judge attached significant weight to  the  explanation
    advanced by the appellant at his appeal hearing for the  commission  of
    his offence. The judge simply did not believe the story that  had  been
    advanced by the appellant and, in paragraphs  68  to  80,  she  gave  a
    number of reasons for disbelieving that account. Her conclusion was one
    she was rationally entitled to  reach  for  the  reasons  advanced.  No
    challenge has been mounted to this aspect of the decision.

20.  The judge had regard to  the  probation  report.  This  is  clear  from
    paragraphs 6 to 14  of  the  decision.  There  are  further  references
    throughout the decision (e.g. paragraphs 67 and 68)  to  the  probation
    report. This suggests the judge did have the probation report in  mind.
    I accept that the judge does not make further explicit reference to the
    risk assessment in the probation report but I  am  satisfied  that  the
    reasoning in paragraph 81(ii) is nevertheless sustainable. Based on the
    appellant's oral evidence the judge was clearly entitled to  find  that
    he was not in fact remorseful  and  deflected  responsibility  for  his
    serious  crime.  The  references  in  section  82(ii)   to   'financial
    difficulties' reflect the probation report as detailed in paragraphs 6,
    10, 56 and 79 of the decision. The probation report indicated that risk
    factors would include situations where the appellant would  be  in  the
    community and unemployed and experiencing financial  difficulties.  The
    probation  report  observed  that  any  significant  reduction  in  the
    appellant's income may increase the risk of offending behaviour.

21.  At paragraph 56 of the decision the  judge  acknowledged  the  evidence
    relating to employment but  found  there  was  little  in  the  way  of
    documentary evidence to substantiate those claims. At paragraph 79  the
    judge again made reference to the absence of cogent  evidence  provided
    by or on behalf of the appellant concerning, amongst other things,  his
    employment and his wife's employment. Reference was made  to  a  single
    letter from an agency dated 16 April 2015  confirming  the  appellant's
    employment with them but otherwise not specifying that employment.

22.  I am satisfied that the judge  was  entitled  to  conclude,  given  the
    absence of cogent evidence of the appellant's  financial  and  personal
    circumstances and his attempt to diminish his  responsibility  for  his
    offence, that he did pose a real risk of harm to the public. The  final
    sentence of paragraph 81(ii) is not, regrettably,  an  example  of  the
    clearest reasoning. I am nevertheless satisfied that the  reference  to
    the word "found", in the past tense, can only rationally  mean  "find".
    The reference to conduct during the  period  of  licence  contained  in
    81(ii) must indicate that the judge was not considering the  past  risk
    but the present risk. I additionally have regard to the  Tribunal  case
    of Vasconcelos (risk - rehabilitation) [2013] UKUT  00378  (IAC)  which
    indicates that a judge is not  bound  by  conclusions  in  a  probation
    report  if  her  overall  assessment  of  the  evidence  supports   the
    conclusion of continued risk. A  judge  is  entitled  to  consider  the
    evidence before her in a holistic manner and I am satisfied  that  this
    judge was entitled to attach significant weight to the appellant's oral
    evidence and the limited amount of documentary  evidence  available  to
    her in reaching her overall assessment.  For these  reasons  I  am  not
    satisfied that the ground of appeal is made out.

23.  The second ground of appeal takes issue with the judge's assessment  of
    the appellant's  culpability.   I  am  satisfied  that  the  judge  was
    entitled to consider whether the appellant accepts  responsibility  for
    the previous  offending.   If  an  individual  seeks  to  reduce  their
    culpability this is a possible indication that they are not  remorseful
    or that their behaviour which  led  to  criminality  has  not  changed.
    Confronting and accepting previous criminality is directly relevant  to
    the question of present risk and, on the evidence before her, the judge
    was rationally entitled to her conclusion.

24.  With respect to ground 3, for the reasons that I have already given,  I
    am satisfied that the Article 8  assessment  is  not  coloured  by  the
    claimed errors of law in grounds 1 and 2. At paragraph 81(iv) the judge
    clearly  took  account   of   all   relevant   circumstances   in   the
    proportionality assessment within the 2006 Regulations. The judge  took
    into account the period of time that the appellant and his  family  had
    lived in the United Kingdom. The judge considered the lack of  evidence
    relating to the assertion that the wife had suffered ill-health  during
    the appellant's incarceration, and she noted  the  relative  ease  with
    which the family could continue to visit  and  communicate.  The  judge
    considered the issue of rehabilitation and made  express  reference  to
    the  duty  contained  in  section  55.  The   judge's   assessment   of
    proportionality under Article 8 was brief but it was made with  express
    reference to her earlier assessment under paragraph 81(iv). Outside  of
    the 2006 Regulations, having received a custodial sentence of more than
    four years, the appellant would need  to  demonstrate  very  compelling
    circumstances over and above those in paragraphs 399 and  399A  of  the
    Immigration Rules. I am entirely satisfied that the appellant had  been
    unable to demonstrate the existence of  very  compelling  circumstances
    based on the factual findings of the judge.  In these circumstances the
    brief analysis of Article 8 does not disclose  any  material  error  of
    law. I therefore dismiss the appeal.
