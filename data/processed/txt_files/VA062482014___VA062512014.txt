Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the appeal of the two Appellants to the Upper Tribunal  against
    a decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Clapham)  promulgated  on
    24th September 2015 dismissing their appeals against the  decisions  of
    an Entry Clearance Officer of 31st August 2014 refusing to  grant  them
    entry clearance to come to the UK as visitors.

 2. The two Appellants are nationals of Pakistan and are  married  to  each
    other.  Fawad Ahmed Fahad (hereinafter "the first Appellant") was  born
    on 12th  October  1982  and  Amtul  Mukaram  (hereinafter  "the  second
    Appellant")  was  born  on   10th   February   1984.    They   applied,
    simultaneously, for entry clearance in August 2014 and  indicated  that
    they wished to visit a UK based brother  of  the  first  Appellant  for
    compassionate reasons for a period of two weeks.  It was said that  the
    two Appellants had four dependent children though I cannot see that any
    applications were made on behalf of any of them.  It was indicated that
    the first Appellant had full-time employment as a manager with  a  firm
    called Supernet Limited.  Although it was not obvious from the  way  in
    which the entry clearance application forms  had  been  completed,  the
    brother they were proposing to visit was Mr Ihsan Ahmad Muneeb who  is,
    very sadly, now deceased.  Reference was also made in  the  application
    to another brother of the first Appellant one Arshad Mahmood.

 3. The Entry Clearance Officer did not interview either of the Appellants.
     Instead, the applications were considered and refused on the basis  of
    the documentation which had  been  provided.   Both  applications  were
    refused because, in short, the Entry Clearance Officer considered  that
    the two had failed to demonstrate  that  they  were  genuinely  seeking
    entry as visitors and had failed to demonstrate that they  intended  to
    leave the UK at the end of the proposed  visit.   The  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's specific concerns related largely to matters surrounding  the
    financial standing of the first Appellant.  In this context, the  Entry
    Clearance Officer said that he had failed to  demonstrate  how  he  had
    managed to accrue funds which equated to 21 times  his  stated  monthly
    income.  He had indicated the cost of the visit to  him  to  amount  to
    some �1,000 but had not demonstrated that the proposed expenditure  was
    commensurate with his circumstances.  It was these matters which caused
    the Entry Clearance Officer to doubt the genuineness  of  each  of  the
    applications and to cause him to  conclude  that  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 41(i) and(ii) of the Immigration Rules were not met.

 4. The two Appellants appealed.  They did so in reliance upon Article 8 of
    the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).  In the grounds it  was
    explained,  amongst  other  things,  that  the  first  Appellant's  now
    deceased brother had been in an accident at work.  Specifically it  was
    said that there had been an explosion at his place of work and that his
    "whole body is burned".  It was suggested that, in these circumstances,
    refusal represented a  disproportionate  interference  with  Article  8
    rights.  Pausing there, I note  that  there  is  in  the  documentation
    before me an undated letter written by a GP (the brother's GP) in which
    it is stated that he had sustained "massive burns to  the  whole  body"
    following an incident where he works.  I am not sure when it  was  that
    that letter was obtained and submitted but it seems it must  have  been
    available to Judge Clapham when he made his decision.

 5. Returning to the narrative, the lodging  of  the  two  appeals  led  to
    matters being reconsidered  by  an  Entry  Clearance  Manager  but  the
    decision was not altered in any way.  The Entry Clearance Manager does,
    in his reconsideration, make reference  to  there  being  compassionate
    circumstances but does not refer to them specifically or in any detail.
     Since the decisions were unaltered the appeals proceeded.

 6. Neither Appellant requested  an  oral  hearing  and  the  appeals  were
    decided on the  papers.   Oddly,  although  the  judge's  determination
    indicates the appeal was considered on the papers on 4th June 2015, the
    determination was not promulgated until 24th September 2015.  I am  not
    sure why that was but I do not think anything turns on it.

 7.  The  judge,  in  what  it  is  fair  to  describe  as  a  very   brief
    determination, found that the requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    (the ones placed in issue by the Entry Clearance Officer) were not  met
    with respect to either Appellant and also found that  any  interference
    with Article 8 rights was proportionate.  The  judge's  reasoning  with
    respect to the Rules was as follows;

         "3.  The Entry Clearance Officer acting on behalf of the Respondent
             refused the  applications  on  the  basis  that  although  the
             application forms stated that the  first  named  Appellant  is
             employed as a manager at Supernet Limited, the Appellant (then
             the applicant) had not demonstrated that  he  has  leave  from
             work or that he has a role to return to.   Further,  the  bank
             statements submitted showed a closing balance which equated to
             21 times his  stated  monthly  income.   The  Entry  Clearance
             Officer therefore was not satisfied that the employment of the
             first named Appellant and income are as claimed  or  that  the
             funds in the bank account are  genuinely  available  for  use.
             Moreover,  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer   noted   that   the
             Appellants' claimed expenditure on the trip amounted  to  over
             two times disposable income for a ten day trip to  the  United
             Kingdom.  In all of the above, the Entry Clearance Officer did
             not consider that the Appellants were genuine visitors to  the
             United Kingdom who would return at the end of  the  period  of
             their proposed visit.

         4.   I make no order in connection with anonymity.

         5.   It is for the Appellants to establish their case, the standard
             of proof being the balance of probabilities.   Otherwise,  the
             appeals fail.

         6.   The Grounds of Appeal are limited in this case  to  particular
             matters.  In particular they are limited to  Section  84(1)(c)
             of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

         7.   The applications were refused by an Entry Clearance Manager on
             3rd March, 2015 and he upheld the decisions.  As I am  limited
             in the matters to which I can address myself, it seems  to  me
             that both the Entry Clearance  Officer  and  the  manager  had
             certain concerns in connection with the financial evidence  of
             the Appellants.  These concerns appear to me to  be  justified
             and it is for the Appellants to discharge the burden of proof.
              I have  a  good  deal  of  sympathy  with  the  circumstances
             concerning the original applications,  but  the  fact  of  the
             matter is  that  the  documentation  regarding  the  financial
             matters was simply inconsistent and lacking."

 8. And as with Article 8 his reasoning was as follows;

         "8.  I am also conscious  that  the  Appellants  state  that  their
             rights are breached in terms of Article 8.  Article 8  is  not
             an absolute right.  Every country  has  a  right  to  maintain
             immigration controls.  The refusals are proportionate  and  it
             is  for  the  Appellants  to  ensure  that  the  correct   and
             sufficient documentation is exhibited.  I suggest that in  any
             future  applications,  the   Appellants   ensure   that   full
             disclosures regarding their financial circumstances are made."

 9. Hence the appeals failed.  However that was not the end of  the  matter
    because the Appellants applied for and obtained permission to appeal to
    the Upper Tribunal.  The salient part of the grant of permission  reads
    as follows;

         "2.  The Appellants had a right of appeal on human  rights  grounds
             only.

         3.   The judge did not determine  whether  the  Appellants  had  an
             Article 8 family life connection with the  United  Kingdom  or
             whether Article  8  was  engaged.   The  judge  dismissed  the
             appeals under Article 8 on the basis that  the  refusals  were
             proportionate as it was for 'the Appellants to ensure that the
             correct  and  sufficient  documentation'  was  exhibited.   In
             respect of the documentation, the judge  simply  recorded  the
             concerns of the Entry Clearance Officer and  stated  that  the
             concerns appear to be justified, without further explanation.

         4.   The grounds contend amongst other things that the judge failed
             to consider the financial evidence submitted by the Appellants
             and failed adequately to address Article 8.

         5.   Whilst the Appellants' ultimate  prospects  of  succeeding  on
             these appeals is very limited, they are entitled to have their
             appeals properly considered and to know how the  decision  has
             been arrived at.  It is arguable  that  it  is  insufficiently
             clear from the decision how  the  decision  has  been  reached
             bearing in mind the summary approach to Article 8 and the lack
             of reasoning in relation to the documents."

10. There was then a hearing before the Upper Tribunal (before me) so  that
    it could be considered whether or not the judge had erred in  law  and,
    if so, what should flow from that.  The Appellants,  of  course,  being
    out of the country, were unable to attend.  They were  not  represented
    before me.  The Respondent was represented by  Mrs  R  Pettersen.   Mrs
    Pettersen  acknowledged   that   there   were   shortcomings   in   the
    determination and said she would  not  oppose  its  setting  aside.   I
    decided I would set it aside for reasons  which  are  explained  below.
    Matters then proceeded to remaking.   Mrs  Pettersen,  here,  submitted
    that matters turned upon proportionality.  In this context, she  argued
    that there was not enough material to make out  a  compelling  case  in
    favour of the two Appellants because  the  brother  who  had  been  the
    victim of the accident clearly had other family  in  the  UK  who  were
    assisting him.

11. I decided to set the decision aside for a number of reasons.   In  this
    context, the judge, although he appreciated the  right  of  appeal  was
    under Article 8, did consider whether or not the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules  were  met.   Following  what  was  said  in  Mostafa
    (Article 8 in entry clearance) [2015] UKUT 112  IAC  and  Adjei  (Visit
    visas - Article 8) [2015] UKUT 261 IAC he was correct to  do  so  as  a
    prelude to and as a part of his Article 8 consideration.  However,  the
    two  Appellants  had  filed  a  considerable  amount  of  documentation
    concerning  their  financial  standing  in  Pakistan   including   bank
    statements, payslips evidencing the first  Appellant's  employment  and
    evidence of payment of tax on earnings.  The judge  did  not  refer  to
    that documentation albeit that it did have potential relevance  to  the
    bases upon which the two applications  had  been  refused.   The  judge
    could have considered the evidence and rejected it but it seems  to  me
    that he was required  to  demonstrate  he  was  aware  of  it  and  had
    considered it before reaching his conclusions as to the disputed  parts
    of the Immigration Rules.  In not doing that he did err.

12. Further, the judge did not appear to undertake his own assessment as to
    the merits of the Entry Clearance Officer's reasoning with  respect  to
    the Immigration Rules.  As was pointed out in the grant of  permission,
    he appeared to simply observe that the concerns of the Entry  Clearance
    Officer, in that regard, appeared to be justified.  It does not seem to
    me that it was necessarily obvious that the  concerns  were  justified.
    For example, it is not obvious that having a sum of  money  in  a  bank
    account equating to 21 times one's monthly income is suspicious nor  is
    it  obvious  that  the  spending   of   �1,000   was   likely   to   be
    disproportionate bearing in mind the particular circumstances which the
    two Appellants  said  justified  the  visit  (the  clearly  significant
    injuries to the brother).  Thus, I conclude that the judge  has  failed
    to give any reasons of substance for his decision to  the  effect  that
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules were not met.   I  appreciate
    that the appeal was on  human  rights  grounds  but,  as  indicated,  a
    consideration of what the position was under the Rules was  a  starting
    point and was of potential relevance to the article 8  issue  and  that
    consideration had to be undertaken properly.

13. Further still, the clearly significant injuries  to  the  unfortunately
    now deceased brother of  the  first  Appellant  represented  a  clearly
    relevant matter with respect to Article 8 of the ECHR and,  but  for  a
    passing  reference  to  "the  circumstances  concerning  the   original
    applications" that does not seem to have been taken into  account  when
    deciding the question of proportionality.

14. For all of the above reasons I did set the decision aside.

15. As to remaking, Mrs Pettersen, as indicated, expressed  the  view  that
    matters did turn upon proportionality but  said  that  there  were  not
    compelling circumstances  such  as  to  render  the  refusal  of  entry
    clearance disproportionate with respect to the  Appellants.   The  fact
    that she did acknowledge that matters turned on proportionality  was  a
    recognition  or  acceptance  by  her  that  Article  8   was   engaged.
    Otherwise,  she  would  not  have  said  matters  boiled  down   to   a
    proportionality assessment.

16. As to the position under the Rules, I do not see that having  21  times
    one's monthly income in accrued funds is, of itself, suspicious and  it
    does seem to me that, on the face of it, it might well be thought  that
    significant expenditure is justified in order to visit a close relative
    who has received serious and what was quite possibly appreciated to  be
    at the  time,  life  threatening  injuries.   In  addition,  the  first
    Appellant has supplied bank statements dating back to early 2014, which
    demonstrate regular income and expenditure, and which do not seem to me
    to betray any suspicious pattern.  There  is,  as  indicated,  evidence
    regarding the payment of tax which, on the face of it,  appears  to  be
    genuine and which was not at any point  the  subject  of  any  specific
    challenge.  There are payslips  which,  again,  do  not  appear  to  be
    suspicious on the face of it and there is also a letter  from  Supernet
    confirming the first Appellant's employment, his job title and the date
    of commencement of that employment.  Again, I  see  nothing  suspicious
    about it.  On the material before me, therefore, I  conclude  that  the
    Entry Clearance Officer's concerns regarding the financial standing  of
    the two Appellants and, seemingly, the genuineness of  the  documentary
    evidence they have produced in that regard are not made  out.   I  also
    take  the  view  that,  in  the  circumstances  it  is   very   readily
    understandable that the two Appellants would wish to  visit  the  first
    Appellant's brother.  I conclude, therefore, that both  the  first  and
    the second Appellant  have  successfully  demonstrated  that  they  are
    genuine visitors and that they do have the requisite intention to leave
    the UK at the end of the proposed visit.

17. If the two Appellants had a right of appeal under the Rules, therefore,
    on the above findings, they would both succeed.  However, that  is  not
    the case.  Their appeal is limited to Article 8 grounds.  In  light  of
    what is said in SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 and Kaur (Visit appeals;
    Article 8) [2015] UKUT 487 IAC I take the view that it is necessary for
    the  two  Appellants  to  demonstrate   that   there   are   compelling
    circumstances or circumstances of a particular pressing nature such  as
    to justify their being granted entry clearance and that,  if  they  are
    unable to do that, they will not succeed under Article 8.

18. In this context, the  two  Appellants  were  wishing  to  see  a  close
    relative who had what I think it  is  fair  to  say  at  the  dates  of
    application and decision, life threatening injuries.  Mrs Pettersen, in
    effect, accepted that Article 8 was  engaged  and  I  proceed  on  that
    basis.  Clearly, any interference with Article 8 rights  brought  about
    by the refusal of entry clearance is lawful and is in  pursuance  of  a
    legitimate aim so the remaining issue is that  of  proportionality.   A
    part of that consideration is my finding that  the  two  Appellants  do
    satisfy the requirements of the Immigration Rules but that is certainly
    not nearly  enough  of  itself.   However,  whilst  I  accept  it  will
    ordinarily be very difficult to demonstrate in the context of  a  visit
    visa application and appeal that any interference with Article 8 rights
    is disproportionate, this is  an  unusual  case.   There  clearly  were
    compassionate circumstances of a specific nature.  Indeed,  in  looking
    at the circumstances as they stood  as  at  the  decision  date,  I  do
    conclude that there were compelling circumstances or, put another  way,
    circumstances of a particularly pressing nature which, bearing in  mind
    the  obvious  extent  of  the  injuries,  demonstrated,  that  on   the
    particular facts of these two appeals, the interference with Article  8
    rights was disproportionate.

19. In light of the above, therefore, in remaking these decisions, I  allow
    the appeals of each claimant.

20. In truth, though, I am not sure whether the two Appellants will  derive
    any practical benefit from my allowing of  their  appeals.   They  both
    wished to visit the first Appellant's brother and, of course, sadly  he
    has passed away.  That certainly represents  a  significant  change  in
    circumstances since the date of the decisions under appeal.  I do note,
    though, that the refusal of a visa  to  foreign  nationals  seeking  to
    enter the UK for a finite period  for  the  purpose  of  mourning  with
    family members the recent death of  a  close  relative  is  capable  of
    constituting a disproportionate interference with  the  rights  of  the
    persons concerned under Article 8 and have  in  mind  the  decision  in
    Abbasi and another (Visits - bereavement - Article  8)  [2015]  UT  463
    IAC.  It may be, therefore, that the Entry Clearance Officer, in  these
    particular circumstances, might feel able to issue visas to  the  first
    and second Appellant  despite  the  relevant  post-decision  change  in
    circumstances.  However, I do not seek  to  make  any  direction  about
    that.

Notice of Decision (First Appellant)

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law.  I set aside its decision.  I remake the decision and, in so  doing,  I
allow the Appellant's appeal against the Entry Clearance Officer's  decision
to refuse entry clearance.

Notice of Decision (Second Appellant)

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law.  I set aside its decision.  I remake the decision and, in so  doing,  I
allow the Appellant's appeal against the Entry Clearance Officer's  decision
to refuse entry clearance.

Anonymity

I make no anonymity directions.  None have been sought.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As these appeals have succeeded and as it  appears  to  me  that  there  was
material before the Entry Clearance Officer and the Entry Clearance  Manager
which might reasonably have been thought to  weigh  in  favour  of  the  two
Appellants, I have decided to make a full fee award  with  respect  to  both
appeals.
