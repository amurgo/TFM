                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by Mrs Olajumoke Tolu Akomalade, a citizen of Nigeria
    born 2nd May 1982.  She appeals against the decision of the  Respondent
    made on 14th January 2013 to refuse entry clearance as a partner  under
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  The Appellant  appealed  against
    that refusal and the appeal was  heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Herbert on 14th February 2014.  He allowed the appeal under  Article  8
    ECHR, relying on the decision in MM, R (On the Application  of)  v  The
    Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  [2013]   EWHC   1900.
    Permission to appeal was granted to the Secretary of State and  on  5th
    June 2014, having heard submissions, I found that there was a  material
    error of law in the determination of Judge Herbert and I set  it  aside
    with no preserved findings of fact.

 2. The Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) refused the  application  because  he
    was not satisfied that the Appellant  meets  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  He noted  confusion about the  date  the  Appellant
    and Sponsor met and that  it seems from the marriage Certificate   that
    although the  Appellant  had  said  that  they  were  married  on  15th
    December 2012, it was actually 15th December 2011.     No  evidence  of
    phone contact was provided  and  only  three  instances  of  electronic
    communication.   The  ECO  was  not  therefore   satisfied   that   the
    relationship is genuine and subsisting or that  the  couple  intend  to
    live together  permanently  in  the  UK.   The  ECO  also  refused  the
    application on financial grounds because  although  the  Appellant  had
    said that the Sponsor  earns  �25,000  per  annum,   the  P60  she  had
    submitted for his earnings for the tax year 2011 to 2012 showed  a  sum
    of only �12,014.78.  In addition the Appellant had  not  submitted  all
    the documents required under Appendix FM-SE of the Rules to confirm his
    financial circumstances.

 3. The Sponsor, Mr Saidu,  appeared at  the  hearing.   He  had  submitted
    additional documentation in the days  prior  to  the  hearing  but  the
    Respondent had not received this and some time was given to  Mr  Deller
    to consider it.  Among the documents was the Sponsor's P60 for the year
    to April 2014 which showed income from self-employment.  The P60 up  to
    April 2013 was also produced and it too showed a sum (of around �6,500)
     from self-employment.  The Sponsor had written a letter expressing his
    disappointment at the fact that his appeal had been  allowed  and  then
    overturned, saying that he had provided all the necessary  evidence  to
    the ECO and to Judge Herbert at the hearing before him.  He  said  that
    he does meet the financial requirements and that he does not understand
    why his appeal has been dismissed.

 4. I asked Mr Saidu if evidence of his earnings from self-employment as  a
    caterer had been before the ECO.  He said that it had  not  because  he
    had only really begun to build up that business after he had  completed
    the application.  He agreed that there was no  mention  of  it  in  the
    application form.  He had provided some other documents relative to his
    earnings and financial situation, most of which had not been before the
    ECO and some of which post-dated the decision.

 5. Judge Herbert had found that the marriage is genuine and subsisting and
    I have no issue with that finding.  I  agree  that  the  Appellant  has
    provided sufficient evidence to show that her marriage to  the  Sponsor
    is a genuine and subsisting one.

 6. The only issue therefore is that of  the  Sponsor's  earnings  and  the
    question of whether  he  meets  the  minimum  earnings  requirement  of
    �18,600.  It seems to be that at the date  of  the  hearing  before  me
    today he did meet that threshold.  Unfortunately he had never consulted
    a solicitor  and  was  not  represented  and  did  not  appreciate  the
    complexity of the requirements set out in Appendix FM and in particular
    of Appendix FM-SE.

 7. Both Mr Deller and I explained to the Sponsor that the relevant date in
    this case is the date of the decision.  It is clear that  the  P60  for
    the year to 6th April 2013 could not have been with the ECO in  January
    2013 when he made the decision because it would not have been issued at
    that time and the Sponsor in any event conceded that the  business  was
    not up and running when the application was made and determined.  There
    was therefore no evidence relative to the date  of  decision  that  the
    Appellant  met the requirements  of  the  Rules  and  the  appeal  must
    therefore fail.

 8. It was  also explained to the Sponsor  why Judge  Herbert  had  allowed
    the appeal on human rights grounds and again I made  it  clear  to  him
    that I would not be able in his case to  find  that  refusal  of  entry
    clearance to his wife would amount to a  disproportionate  interference
    with their family life.   It is clear that Judge Herbert  had  made  up
    his mind that he was going to follow the decision of Justice  Blake  in
    MM and as a result of that he really did not give proper  consideration
    to the question  of  whether  or  not  the  Appellant  could  meet  the
    requirement that he provide evidence of earnings of  at  least  �18,600
    per annum. He did not address the issue of documentary evidence and  so
    the Appellant was unaware that he had failed to comply with Appendix FM-
    SE.  The Appellant therefore clearly found it difficult  to  understand
    why he had not been  advised  at  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that he had not provided the necessary documentation.  I  gave
    the  Appellant  some  details  of  Appendix  FM-SE  relative  to   both
    employment and self-employment and made it clear to him  that  I  could
    not allow the appeal and that the best solution would  be  for  him  to
    submit a fresh application enclosing all the required documentation  as
    soon as practicably possible.

 9. I would hope that a fresh application can be dealt with as promptly  as
    possible.

Decision

The appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
