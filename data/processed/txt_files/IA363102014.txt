                                  CHUN ZHAO
                                                                   Appellant

                                     and


                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                 NOTICE OF ABANDONMENT PURUSANT TO RULE 17A

 1. By way of a letter to the Upper Tribunal  dated  26  February  2015  the
    appellant's representative states that appellant  has  left  the  United
    Kingdom and thus his appeal is deemed withdrawn.

 2. Although  section  104  of  the   2002  Act  has  been  amended  by  the
    Immigration Act 2014 with effect from 20 October 2014  by  operation  of
    The  Immigration  Act  (Commencement  No.  3,  Transitional  and  Saving
    Provisions) Order 2014 ("the Order"), section 104 of the 2002 Act is one
    of the "saved provisions" as defined in article 1 (e) of that order  and
    so by operation of article 9 of the Order, continues to have  effect  as
    the appellant is not a person who falls within either article 10  or  11
    of the Order.

 3. I am therefore satisfied that as  the  applicant  has  left  the  United
    Kingdom, the appeal is to be treated as abandoned  pursuant  to  section
    104 (4) of the 2002 Act. The  Upper  Tribunal  must  therefore  issue  a
    notice pursuant to rule 17A (2) informing the parties that the appeal is
    being treated as abandoned. This is a Notice pursuant to rule 17A (2) to
    inform the parties that the appellant's case is deemed abandoned.

 4. The effect of the respondent's case being deemed abandoned is  that  the
    proceedings before the Upper Tribunal are at an end


Signed                              Date:  11 March 2015
