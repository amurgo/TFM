                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal (Judge John Hamilton), sitting at Hatton Cross on 24 October
       2013, to  a widower's article 8 appeal by a citizen of India, born 30
       April 1968. Since then, the case has been to the Court of Appeal  and
       back by way of a consent order: All that needs to be said about  that
       here for the moment is to give the result, which is  that  the  Upper
       Tribunal hearing starts again before me, but from the point where  it
       is agreed that the judge made a material error of law, in not  taking
       proper account of what is said to be the  'historical  injustice'  of
       the Home Office not giving him a husband visa before  his  late  wife
       died. The limited point on which the judge allowed  the  appeal  (the
       unlawfulness of the removal directions when made) stands so far as it
       goes; but the law on it has now of course changed.

    2. Relevant dates
|early       |2008  |appellant meets wife, a British citizen, in India |

|            |      |appellant applies for husband visa in India       |
|            |      |refused, on maintenance grounds, and because 'no  |
|            |      |insurmountable obstacles to family life with that |
|            |      |partner continuing outside the UK': appellant and |

|3 May       |      |wife dies in India                                |
|            |      |appellant reports his wife's death, but makes it  |
|19 May      |      |clear he still wants to come here and wind up her |
|            |      |affairs                                           |
|            |      |appellant given husband visa till 19 August 2012  |
|17 August   |2012  |appellant applies for indefinite leave to remain  |
|23 April    |2013  |application refused: appellant does not qualify   |
|            |      |for leave                                         |
|            |      |(a) under paragraph 287 (b) of Rules, as husband  |
|            |      |visa not issued before wife's death;              |
|            |      |(b) under paragraph 276ADE, as still has ties with|
|            |      |India                                             |


    3. The appellant's case, in a nutshell, is that the failure on the  part
       of the entry clearance officer to give him a visa at any time between
       his appeal being allowed on 1 March 2010 and his wife's death  on  11
       April amounts to a 'historic injustice' not catered for by the  Rules
       as they stand, so that amounts to the exceptional  circumstances  now
       required for success under article 8, outside the terms of the Rules.

    4. Mr Dhanji helpfully referred me to Geraldo & others [2013] EWHC  2763
       (Admin). This is a  permission  decision,  not  normally  citable  as
       authority itself; but King J at paragraph 29 conveniently  summed  up
       the effect of previous authority, as follows:

             i) the  historic  injustice  must  be  based  upon  some  prior
                illegality ...

            ii) there must be  sufficient  causal  connection  between  that
                illegality  and  the  alleged  historic   injustice   caused
                thereby, and

           iii) the alleged prejudice caused to the claimant by the decision
                under challenge to justify the intervention of the court.

            iv)  Considerations  of  'conspicuous  unfairness'  are  not  in
                themselves a relevant test to trigger  the  intervention  of
                the court,  although  the  degree  of  prejudice  may  be  a
                relevant factor when it comes to the question of remedy.

    5. It will be clear that the appellant's case depends  on  there  having
       been 'some prior illegality': I don't think just under 6 weeks' delay
       in the issuing of a visa,  following  a  successful  appeal,  can  be
       classified like that, unless of course there has been a direction for
       expedition, which in this case there was not. Of course it  took  the
       entry clearance officer till 19 May to give  him  his  husband  visa,
       following his request on 3 May; but none of the delay after 11  April
       was material to the position under paragraph 287, the  relevant  part
       of which requires that:

             a) the applicant was admitted  to  the  United  Kingdom  for  a
                period not exceeding 27 months or given an extension of stay
                for a period of 2 years as the spouse or civil partner of  a
                person  present  and  settled  in  the  United  Kingdom   in
                accordance with paragraphs 281 to 286 of these Rules;

             b) ... and

                (ii) the person whom the applicant was admitted  or  granted
                an extension of stay to join died during that period

    6. It doesn't seem to me that the trite statement  of  the  law  in  the
       statement of reasons attached to the Court of  Appeal  consent  order
       establishes any prior illegality on the six weeks' delay in issuing a
       husband visa. What the statement of reasons said at paragraph  6  was
       this  "A  refusal  of  leave  that  amounts  to  a   disproportionate
       interference with an individual's Article 8 rights is unlawful,  such
       as is the case in the decision [to refuse  the  appellant  a  husband
       visa while his wife was still alive, though seriously  ill]  dated  4
       November 2009". To that extent, the decision reversed on appeal on  1
       March 2010 was not only wrong on its merits, but unlawful.

    7. The next  question  is  what  'historic  injustice'  was  caused  the
       appellant by not giving him a husband visa  at  any  time  between  4
       November 2009, and her death on 11 April 2010.  There  had  certainly
       been, with the benefit of hindsight, an injustice both to him and her
       in not letting him come back here with her and care for her  in  what
       was now her own country in her latter days.

    8. It follows that I have to consider what prejudice this caused to  the
       appellant, in terms of the decision under appeal in this case,  which
       was not to extend indefinitely the 27 months'  husband  visa  he  had
       been granted on 19 May 2010. That visa was given in the  first  place
       for the appellant to wind up his late wife's affairs in this country;
       and in evidence at the first-tier hearing he confirmed (see paragraph
       26 of the decision) that he had not wanted to stay on here at  first,
       but had changed his mind while here. Sad as it was that the appellant
       hadn't been able to come home with his wife and care for  her  before
       she died, I don't think  that  had  anything  to  do  with  the  Home
       Office's refusal to let him  change  his  mind,  after  he  had  been
       allowed to come here for a limited time and wind up her affairs.

    9. In my view the decision to let the appellant come here  and  do  that
       was entirely right, and clearly the work of a sympathetic and  humane
       entry clearance officer. That most certainly did  not  mean  that  he
       also needed to be granted the right to stay here indefinitely,  after
       he had done what he had originally wanted and been allowed to do.  Of
       course the appellant has lost a benefit, by way of an opportunity  to
       apply for indefinite leave to remain, to which  he  would  have  been
       entitled if given a visa in November  2009;  but  that  was  entirely
       incidental to the reasons for which refusal to do so was unlawful, in
       other words his loss of the chance to spend what turned out to be his
       wife's latter days here with her. While, as the statement of  reasons
       recorded, the first-tier judge's decision was wrong, in  my  view  he
       reached the right result, for the reasons I have given.
