For the Respondent:    Mr. S. Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 27th November  1984.   He
    appeals against a decision of the Respondent dated 6th February 2014 to
    refuse his application for indefinite leave to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom as the spouse of Louise  Michelle  Ikpeme,  a  British  citizen
    ("the Sponsor").  His appeal was dismissed by Judge of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Kennedy sitting at Hatton  Cross  on  6th  March  2015.   That
    decision was set aside by Deputy Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Lewis  on  8th
    February 2016 who directed that the decision in the Appellant's  appeal
    should be remade after a further hearing  before  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    That re-hearing took place before me on 6th May 2016 and I now give  my
    decision herein.  Judge Lewis' reasons for finding an error of law  are
    summarised at paragraph 11 below.

2.   The Appellant entered the United Kingdom in 2003 on a  two  year  visit
    visa which was extended until 2007.  In 2008  he  was  arrested  whilst
    working using false documents  and  was  sentenced  to  twelve  months'
    imprisonment on 28th May 2008.  On his release from prison in  2009  he
    voluntarily returned to  Nigeria  and  applied  from  there  for  entry
    clearance to return to the United Kingdom as the spouse of the Sponsor,
    having married the Sponsor in Nigeria in April 2009.   He  declared  on
    his application form that he had a previous conviction.  At  that  time
    the conviction  gave  rise  to  a  discretionary  power  to  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer to refuse the Appellant's  application.   It  appears
    (from information subsequently obtained by the Respondent which was not
    present before Judge Kennedy at the original hearing) that a discussion
    ensued at the post following the Entry Clearance  Officer's  notice  of
    the previous  conviction.   It  was  decided  to  grant  the  Appellant
    permission to enter the United Kingdom valid for  a  period  from  29th
    September 2011 to 28th December 2013.

The Application and Refusal

3.   On 4th October 2013 shortly before his leave  was  due  to  expire  the
    Appellant made an application  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain,  the
    refusal of which  has  given  rise  to  the  present  proceedings.  The
    Respondent refused the application for a number of specific reasons: it
    was not accepted that the Appellant and Sponsor were in a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship because the Sponsor was living  in  Bahrain  at
    the time of the application; there  was  inadequate  accommodation  and
    maintenance for the parties  without  recourse  to  public  funds;  the
    Appellant had not demonstrated sufficient knowledge of English and life
    in the United Kingdom.

4.   There was one further reason for refusal which was  under  the  general
    grounds for refusal contained at paragraph 332(1C) of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  This imposed a mandatory ground of refusal that leave to  enter
    was to be  refused  where  the  person  seeking  such  leave  had  been
    convicted  of  an  offence  for  which  they  had  been  sentenced   to
    imprisonment for at least twelve  months  but  less  than  four  years,
    unless a period of fifteen years  had  passed  since  the  end  of  the
    sentence. This paragraph was inserted into  the  Immigration  Rules  on
    13th December 2012 by HC  760  three  years  after  the  Appellant  had
    arrived in the United Kingdom.

The Decision at First Instance

5.   Judge Kennedy dismissed the  appeal  having  heard  evidence  from  the
    Appellant and the Sponsor.  He found that they were in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship and had been so since  they  married  in  April
    2009.  They intended to live permanently with each other as spouses  in
    the United Kingdom and there was a good reason why they had not done so
    at  the  time  of  the  application  consistent  with  that  intention.
    Nevertheless the Judge found that the application fell  to  be  refused
    under paragraph 322(1C) and paragraph 287(a)(vii)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules (demonstration of sufficient knowledge of  the  English  language
    and life in the United Kingdom).  The Judge (who as  I  have  indicated
    did not have all  the  facts  before  him)  did  not  accept  that  the
    Appellant had disclosed his previous conviction. That in his  view  the
    Entry Clearance Officer had made an erroneous decision to  grant  entry
    clearance to the  Appellant  did  not  bind  the  Respondent  to  grant
    indefinite leave to remain in the future.

6.   As the Appellant could not succeed under the Rules the Judge  proceeded
    to consider the matter outside the Rules.  He noted  that  the  Sponsor
    did  not  wish  to  live  in  Nigeria  but  found  there  not   to   be
    insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  between  the  Appellant  and
    Sponsor continuing outside the United Kingdom.  Any  interference  with
    their family life was proportionate.  He dismissed the appeal.

The Error of Law Stage

7.   The Appellant appealed that  decision  disputing  the  Judge's  finding
    that the conviction had not been declared and noting that the Judge had
    wrongly concluded the Appellant  had  been  deported  from  the  United
    Kingdom (when he had in  fact  left  voluntarily).   The  grounds  also
    attacked the  Judge's  Article  8  findings  and  noted  the  difficult
    circumstances at present appertaining in Nigeria. Permission to  appeal
    was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Canavan on 12th August 2015 on  the
    grounds that the Appellant might not have been given a fair opportunity
    to produce evidence to address the point of the conviction and  whether
    it was disclosed.

8.   The error of law hearing was fixed  for  27th  November  2015  but  was
    adjourned on that occasion to 26th January 2016  because  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Lewis felt that the Appellant (who appeared  in  person)
    should be represented.  The Appellant indicated that there had  been  a
    change of circumstances for him in that both he  and  the  Sponsor  had
    obtained  better  employment.   The   Judge   made   some   preliminary
    observations after that November hearing to identify  potential  issues
    and gave directions on the  filing  of  evidence.  He  noted  that  the
    Immigration Rules had been changed on 13th December 2012  to  make  the
    fact of imprisonment a mandatory ground  for  refusal  under  paragraph
    322(1C)  replacing  the  "old"  paragraph  320   (18)   which   was   a
    discretionary ground. That  change  had  come  into  effect  after  the
    Appellant had arrived in the United Kingdom.

9.   Judge Lewis's observations were that the balance struck at the time  of
    the grant to the Appellant of entry clearance was premised on the basis
    that he otherwise met the requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  in
    respect of a spouse, whereas in the  context  of  the  application  for
    indefinite leave to remain the  Appellant  did  not  meet  the  current
    requirements for leave to remain as a spouse.   If  the  Appellant  was
    able to demonstrate that he presently met the requirements of the Rules
    save in respect of his conviction, consideration might need to be given
    to the issue of the impact of the change in the Rules  on  an  offender
    who had previously been able to secure entry at the  discretion  of  an
    Entry Clearance Officer but who now faced removal on the sole basis  of
    the same conviction (paragraph 9(ix) of Judge Lewis's  observations  of
    27th November 2015).  The concept of the public interest might need  to
    be considered on the basis of  a  change  in  the  Rules  as  being  an
    expression of a shift in emphasis of public interest in cases involving
    foreign national offenders.  Judge Lewis acknowledged that these  views
    were without the  assistance  of  submissions  from  either  party  but
    adjourned the case to a later date.

10.  That date  was  26th  January  2016  when  the  Judge  noted  that  the
    Presenting Officer:

     "...was in a position  to  be  able  to  inform  the  Tribunal  at  the
         [previous] hearing on 27th  November  2015  that  a  check  of  the
         Respondent's records had revealed that  the  Appellant  had  indeed
         made a declaration  of  his  conviction  and  that  that  had  been
         expressly considered by an Entry Clearance Manager, the outcome  of
         which was a  favourable  decision  to  grant  the  Appellant  entry
         clearance as a spouse notwithstanding the fact of his  conviction".



11.  Judge Lewis expressed concern at paragraphs 23 and 24 of his  error  of
    law decision that the First-tier Tribunal's consideration of Article  8
    outside of the Immigration Rules may have been influenced by the  First
    Tier's conclusions in respect of the Appellant's entry  to  the  United
    Kingdom. Those conclusions were that the Appellant  had  secured  entry
    clearance by failing to declare his conviction. Since the Appellant had
    not it was an unsure foundation to base his Article 8 findings upon. It
    was an error of law material to the overall consideration of Article  8
    outside the Rules. The appeal needed to be  re-heard.  The  matter  was
    adjourned to a further hearing for evidence to be given when the matter
    came before me.

The Hearing Before Me

12.  The Presenting Officer argued that given  the  Appellant's  failure  to
    meet the life in the United Kingdom test the Appellant could still  not
    meet the Rules. This was an application for indefinite leave to  remain
    outside the Rules under Article 8.  Counsel for the Appellant indicated
    her agreement to this (subject to one point I deal with in more  detail
    below see paragraphs 31 to 33). The Appellant would be giving  evidence
    as would the Sponsor's mother and the Sponsor's maternal uncle, Mr Tony
    Young.  The Sponsor herself was unable to attend court to give evidence
    as she could not obtain time off work.  She had given evidence  to  the
    First-tier that she could not relocate to West Africa (see paragraph  6
    above).  However, neither party wished an adjournment in the matter and
    the case proceeded.

13.  The Appellant adopted his witness statement in which he  described  how
    he had arrived in the United Kingdom in 2003, met the Sponsor  in  July
    2006 and was arrested in 2008.  After the  Appellant  had  returned  to
    Nigeria the Sponsor came out  to  visit  him  there  on  five  separate
    occasions visiting him in Lagos just a few weeks after he was  removed.
    They decided to marry in Nigeria, which they did on  25th  April  2009.
    After two years and seven months in Nigeria the Appellant  returned  to
    the United Kingdom with entry  clearance  as  a  spouse  of  a  settled
    person.

14.  At paragraph 15 of his statement the Appellant explained that  in  2013
    the Sponsor was offered  a  job  opportunity  in  Bahrain  through  her
    stepfather who was a citizen of Bahrain. It was working  as  a  manager
    for a retail group.  The Appellant and Sponsor discussed the  Sponsor's
    move to Bahrain and decided it was too good  an  opportunity  to  miss,
    even though it would mean they were separated.  The contract  was  only
    for a year so they agreed that she  would  go  with  the  intention  of
    returning after a year.  The Appellant applied for indefinite leave  to
    remain in October 2013 thinking if he was granted that leave  he  would
    be able to join the Sponsor in Bahrain for the period of  her  contract
    and the parties would then return to the United Kingdom together.   The
    Sponsor  went  to  Bahrain  in  September  2013,  a  month  before  the
    application, but returned to the United Kingdom in October  2014.   The
    remainder of the statement dealt  with  the  other  objections  of  the
    Respondent, including their means and accommodation,  and  acknowledged
    that the Appellant due to  an  error  had  failed  to  provide  correct
    evidence from a college to satisfy the knowledge of life requirement.

15.  In a supplementary statement dated  15th  January  2016  the  Appellant
    said that on 5th May  2015  he  had  obtained  employment  as  a  sales
    assistant working for a company in Brighton.  He had not realised  that
    he needed a level 3 ESOL qualification as he thought the one he had was
    sufficient to satisfy the  life  in  the  UK  test.   The  Sponsor  was
    employed  full-time  as  a  health  and  safety  administrator  earning
    approximately �300 to �400 per week.  He earned �1,230 per month.   The
    Respondent had the Appellant's passport, therefore he was not  able  to
    sit or pass the life in the UK test.

16.   The  Sponsor's  mother,  Janet  Abdullah,  had  been  diagnosed   with
    arthritis and had  pains  in  her  legs,  arms,  back  and  neck.   The
    Appellant helped around the house by  cleaning,  going  to  the  shops,
    lifting heavy things, mowing the lawn, etc.  He was very  close  to  Mr
    and Mrs Young who were the Sponsor's aunt and uncle who he  visited  at
    least twice a week as they live down the road.  He helped Mr Young  who
    had had a stroke, around the house.  He had laid down  decking  outside
    in the garden.  The Sponsor had tried to live in Nigeria  but  did  not
    feel safe as security was an issue.  On one occasion they had been held
    at gunpoint by the police who  had  stopped  them  simply  because  the
    Appellant was from Nigeria and the Sponsor was from the United Kingdom.
     The Sponsor had caught malaria twice and was very ill.  The  Appellant
    could not find employment or accommodation in Nigeria.

17.  In evidence-in-chief he said that English was the  language  spoken  at
    home.  He confirmed he was still working for Cash Generators full  time
    and could produce up-to-date  payslips.   It  was  not  ideal  for  the
    Sponsor to come to Nigeria with him as she would not have a life there.
     He could not really say what would happen if his  appeal  was  finally
    turned down as to whether she would or would not come.

18.  In cross-examination he said that the Sponsor had  not  attended  today
    to give evidence because she could not get time off work.  This was the
    sixth time that the case had come on for hearing  and  he  had  had  to
    leave work earlier than usual himself to be  there.   The  Sponsor  had
    twenty days per annum annual leave, although he did not know  when  her
    annual leave year started.  When he and the Sponsor were stopped by the
    police in Nigeria they were asked for  money  and  both  taken  to  the
    police station.  When he made  his  application  in  October  2013  the
    Sponsor was in the United Kingdom  not  in  Bahrain  although  she  was
    preparing to go to Bahrain.  It was put to the Appellant  that  if  the
    Sponsor had started work in Bahrein on 11th September 2013 (as noted by
    Judge Kennedy) the Sponsor could not have been in  the  United  Kingdom
    when the Appellant made his application for indefinite leave to  remain
    in the following October.  The Appellant insisted that she had been  in
    the United Kingdom and that they had spoken about it.  The dates  might
    be wrong.

19.  He did not intend to live in Bahrain permanently, the plans  were  that
    they would save some money from that contract and start a new life  for
    themselves.  The Sponsor had four siblings,  three  of  whom  lived  in
    Brighton and one elsewhere.  Whilst the UK based  siblings  could  help
    the Sponsor's mother the Appellant and Sponsor did  not  have  children
    and were freer to do so.  The Sponsor's  siblings  had  three  children
    each.  It was not the couple's intention to  live  with  the  Sponsor's
    mother indefinitely.  In re-examination he said he could  not  remember
    if the Sponsor was in the United Kingdom with him when  he  filled  out
    the application form for indefinite leave to remain.

20.  I next heard evidence from the Sponsor's  mother,  Ms  Janet  Abdullah,
    who adopted her witness statement.  She had not attended her daughter's
    wedding because she could not  afford  the  airfare  to  Nigeria.   The
    Appellant had been trying to  obtain  work.  It  was  only  for  career
    advancement that her daughter, the Sponsor, had chosen to go to Bahrain
    to work.  There was no doubt the marriage was genuine  and  subsisting.
    In a further letter of support dated 12th January 2016  she  said  that
    her health had deteriorated as the case had progressed.  She was now in
    receipt of disability benefits and had been diagnosed  with  arthritis,
    high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, polymyalgia rheumatica  and  most
    recently psoriatic spondyloarthropathy.  Her illnesses were progressive
    and her needs for assistance would grow greater over time.   The  whole
    family would be affected if the Appellant was refused leave to  remain.
    She would worry about the Sponsor going to  Nigeria,  considering  that
    her daughter had had two severe episodes of malaria  during  visits  to
    Nigeria which needed hospitalisation.

21.  In evidence-in-chief she said that polymyalgia  rheumatica  was  muscle
    and joint pain that was getting  progressively  worse.   She  had  been
    suffering for two years from it.  It caused fatigue and made it  harder
    for her to move around.  She did not know how she would manage  if  the
    Appellant were to leave.  If the Appellant  was  removed  her  daughter
    would want to go with him but she would be torn as she had been shot at
    by police on a previous visit to Nigeria.

22.  In cross-examination she denied that she was saying  that  the  Sponsor
    would return with the Appellant rather  she  would  be  torn.   If  the
    Sponsor was not able to assist her with caring it might be any  one  of
    the other children but she had a closer bond  with  the  Appellant  and
    Sponsor because they lived with her.  She was not sure if  the  Sponsor
    had gone to work in Bahrain in November but her  daughter  returned  to
    the United Kingdom two years ago.  She had kept  in  contact  with  the
    Sponsor by using Viber whilst the Sponsor  was  in  Nigeria.   All  her
    other family members lived near her, apart from her son.   They  popped
    in to see her more or less every day.

23.  Finally I heard evidence from Mr Tony  Young,  the  Sponsor's  maternal
    uncle.  His wife had written a letter in support which he  had  signed.
    He had had a stroke ten  years  ago  which  still  affected  him.   The
    Appellant helped the witness with odd jobs and got on well with Mr  and
    Mrs Young's child P for whom they had a Special Guardianship Order.  Mr
    and Mrs Young's two older children did not want to  get  involved.   Mr
    Young managed four properties himself in the Brighton area.

24.  In her statement dated  8th  October  2014  the  Sponsor  detailed  her
    relationship with the Appellant and referred to her own five visits  to
    Nigeria (without mentioning the details of any of the visits).  She had
    travelled to Bahrain with her stepfather many times; it was  a  country
    that she had come to love.  She had been  offered  the  opportunity  to
    work as a store manager for a well-respected American brand  of  goods.
    As at 8th October 2014 when she made that statement she had not in fact
    returned to the United Kingdom  as  the  statement  indicated  she  was
    planning to return on 14th October 2014.  Apart from a brief supporting
    letter (dated 22nd April 2014) written whilst the Sponsor was still  in
    Bahrain there was no other written evidence from the Sponsor by way  of
    statements, though there were more up-to-date wage  slips  produced  to
    show employment and bank statements.

Closing Submissions

25.  For the Respondent reliance was placed on the  refusal  letter.   There
    had been no positive evidence from anyone that there would be a rupture
    of family life if the Appellant's appeal was unsuccessful.  It was hard
    to see where the interference in the quality of family life  was.   For
    policy reasons the Respondent had decided to  tighten  the  Immigration
    Rules to make  a  refusal  under  paragraph  322(1C)  mandatory.   That
    informed public policy.  The case  was  one  outside  the  Rules  under
    Article 8 and the parties could not pick and choose where  to  exercise
    their family life.  The fact of the Sponsor's British  nationality  and
    her employment were not insurmountable obstacles  in  themselves.   Nor
    were they a significant factor in the balancing act  see  the  case  of
    Agyarko at paragraphs 21 and 22.

26.  The Appellant could not succeed under paragraph 287(vi) under the  life
    in the United Kingdom test, although  it  was  apparent  the  Appellant
    spoke very good English.  The Appellant and the  Sponsor  were  healthy
    adults, the wife had visited Nigeria five  times.   The  Appellant  had
    extended family in  Lagos.   The  Appellant's  leave  had  always  been
    precarious (see AM Malawi).  The  Sponsor  had  started  employment  in
    Bahrain on 11th September and had not returned to the United Kingdom by
    the date of the application or the Respondent's decision.  Family  life
    could be continued outside the United Kingdom.  The factors  which  the
    Appellant and Sponsor had put forward as to why they could not live  in
    Nigeria may have spoken to the quality of life but not to  the  ability
    to live.

27.  In closing for the Appellant reliance was  placed  by  Counsel  on  her
    skeleton argument noting that the Appellant  could  still  not  succeed
    under paragraph  287  because  the  Appellant  had  not  completed  his
    knowledge of life test but simply an ordinary ESOL test.   The  refusal
    under paragraph 322(1C) would block the Appellant's ability  to  return
    for fifteen years from the date  of  conviction  in  2008  (i.e.  until
    2023). Under paragraph 284 of the Immigration  Rules  the  requirements
    for an extension of stay as the spouse of a person present and  settled
    in the United Kingdom were that  the  Appellant  had  not  remained  in
    breach of immigration laws and the marriage had not taken place after a
    decision had been made to deport the Appellant.  The Appellant ought to
    be treated as meeting the English language requirement because  he  had
    already met this requirement when he was granted entry  clearance  (see
    Bhudia IJR [2016] UKUT 00025).

28.  In oral submissions Counsel argued that this was an unusual case,  both
    for its complexity and the facts.  The Appellant had  left  the  United
    Kingdom under the voluntary returns scheme and the couple  demonstrated
    their respect for UK immigration laws further by  living  apart  whilst
    the Appellant applied to return.  Notwithstanding these  obstacles  the
    marriage subsisted which was a testament to the strength  of  the  bond
    between the parties.  Entry  clearance  was  obtained  correctly.   The
    Appellant was not someone who had come  to  the  United  Kingdom  on  a
    student or visit visa and then applied to stay, this  was  someone  who
    had come for the purpose of family reunion.  The Appellant failed under
    the Immigration Rules for two reasons, one was the  general  ground  of
    refusal under 322(1C) and secondly because he  had  not  completed  the
    knowledge of life in the UK test.  The Appellant must have provided  an
    English language certificate at the time of entry clearance and  should
    not be required to produce it again and again.   The  English  language
    requirement in the case of Bhudia was the same as  for  the  Appellant.
    Paragraph 284 of the Immigration Rules should therefore be construed so
    as to allow the Appellant to qualify.

29.  The Appellant could not apply for another fifteen years if no  part  of
    the Rules applied.  If the Appellant could not succeed under the  Rules
    then  the  case  was  wholly  outside  the  Rules.    The   suitability
    requirements in Appendix FM had no sunset  provision.   Once  convicted
    one could never meet the suitability requirements.   If  the  Appellant
    was removed there was no chance he could ever apply for entry clearance
    again.  The offence for which he had been convicted was now fading into
    the past.  Since arriving in  the  United  Kingdom  the  Appellant  had
    demonstrated good conduct and had obtained  work.   The  insurmountable
    obstacle test did not bite on this case because this  was  not  a  very
    precarious case.  The obstacles to relocation were only one  factor  to
    be weighed up.  Whilst employment and nationality were not trump cards,
    they all weighed together in the balancing act.  It would not be wholly
    impossible for the wife to leave the United Kingdom, but  it  would  be
    very harsh and difficult.  They would have to start  over  again.   She
    had genuine fears about her safety.

30.  What would be left behind was that  they  were  part  of  a  close-knit
    family.  Other family members could help the Sponsor's mother  but  the
    Appellant and Sponsor were the primary carers for her.   Mr  Young  had
    made it clear that it was not the case that P would have  no-one  else,
    but there was evidence of ties between  the  Appellant  and  P.   There
    would be a wide impact on this close-knit family.  The  factors  to  be
    assessed in the balancing act  as  required  by  Section  117B  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  spoke  largely  in  the
    Appellant's  favour.   Sub-paragraph  (ii)  referred  to  knowledge  of
    English, the Appellant could  speak  English  and  he  was  financially
    independent.  Both the Appellant and Sponsor were in work.  The  little
    weight provisions attached to the establishment of  a  family  life  in
    this country applied where an Appellant was not here lawfully, but that
    was not the case here.  This was a family life case not a private  life
    case.  There were no children of the relationship but the question  was
    how much weight should be placed on the public interest in  immigration
    control?  Where should the proper balance be  struck?   The  Respondent
    had changed the definition of the public  interest  by  making  Section
    322(1C) a mandatory provision.   In  response  the  Presenting  Officer
    indicated that for the Appellant to succeed under paragraph  284  there
    were a lot of "ifs and buts" that could not apply in this case.

Findings

31.  The first issue I  have  to  decide  in  this  appeal  is  whether  the
    Appellant can bring himself within the Immigration Rules  since  if  he
    can no issue of Article 8 will arise.  The Respondent's case on this is
    that the Appellant falls foul of paragraph 322(1C) of  the  Immigration
    Rules a mandatory ban because the Appellant has served a  twelve  month
    prison sentence and secondly that the Appellant cannot comply with  the
    requirement to have passed a knowledge of life in  the  United  Kingdom
    test.  The Appellant's argument on this point is that whilst  he  fails
    under paragraph 287 there is an  alternative  available  to  him  under
    paragraph 284.

32.  Paragraph 284 sets out the requirements for an  extension  of  stay  as
    the spouse of a person present and settled in the United  Kingdom.  For
    the Appellant to succeed he must show (inter alia)  that  he  was  last
    granted limited leave to enter the United Kingdom under the Rules for a
    period of six months or more and (284(iv)) that he has not remained  in
    breach of the immigration laws disregarding any period  of  overstaying
    for a period of 28 days or less.

33.  The Appellant's argument under paragraph 284(iv) is that  he  seeks  to
    persuade the Tribunal that his time in the United Kingdom  both  before
    and during his prison sentence should not be taken into  account  under
    284(iv) but that the slate should be in  effect  wiped  clean  so  that
    paragraph 284(iv) starts again after the Appellant entered  the  United
    Kingdom with leave to enter as the spouse of  the  Sponsor.   Counsel's
    skeleton argument acknowledges the difficulty with this  submission  by
    indicating that the paragraph 284 argument can only succeed as long  as
    the paragraph is construed in this way (that the slate is wiped clean).
     The Immigration Rules do not make any such concession and it is  clear
    from the wording of paragraph 284 that it can only  apply  to  somebody
    who has not overstayed (disregarding any  period  of  28  days).   This
    Appellant overstayed by substantially more than 28 days up to the point
    when he voluntarily left the country and therefore that argument fails.

34.  This appeal falls to be dealt with under Article 8  (right  to  respect
    for private and family life) outside the Immigration Rules.   In  order
    to assess the claim under Article 8 I am  obliged  to  proceed  on  the
    basis of the structured approach required by the case of Razgar  [2004]
    UKHL 27.  The decision made by the Respondent to refuse leave to remain
    will interfere with the Appellant's private and  family  life  in  this
    country.  The Appellant has a family  life  with  his  spouse,  it  was
    accepted at first instance that he and the Sponsor were  in  a  genuine
    and subsisting marriage and it has not been urged upon me to  set  that
    finding aside.  Furthermore the Appellant has now lived and  worked  in
    this country for a number of years and has established a  private  life
    during that time.

35.  The interference with the Appellant's private and family life  will  be
    pursuant to the legitimate  aim  of  immigration  control  because  the
    Appellant falls foul of a mandatory provision generally and because  he
    cannot meet the Rules particularly with regard to the knowledge of life
    test.  The issue as so often in Article 8 appeals  comes  down  to  the
    question of whether the interference with the Appellant's  private  and
    family life is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.

36.  Recent authority from  the  Court  of  Appeal  makes  clear  that  when
    looking at the issue of proportionality the Tribunal must look  at  the
    question of the proportionality of interference through  the  prism  of
    the Immigration Rules. The Appellant  is  as  I  have  indicated  in  a
    genuine and subsisting marriage with the Sponsor.  They  have  adequate
    accommodation as they are living with  the  Sponsor's  mother.   It  is
    apparent from the payslips produced that both the Sponsor and Appellant
    are in employment and all things being equal would manage to  pass  the
    �18,600 threshold.

37.  The Appellant was admitted to this country with leave for a  period  of
    two years a period set to ensure that the marriage was  indeed  genuine
    and subsisting. However the leave was granted with a view to  it  being
    extended thereafter, all other things being equal.  What prevented that
    progression  was  the  introduction  of  paragraph  322(1C)  after  the
    Appellant had arrived in this country and that the  Appellant  did  not
    pass the relevant test at the relevant time. That latter failure cannot
    be simply disregarded, since there is no de minimis principle involved,
    an applicant either satisfies the Rules or they do not.  In  this  case
    the Appellant does not.

38.  In the case  of  Odelola  [2009]  UKHL  25  the  House  of  Lords  were
    concerned with the  construction  of  the  Immigration  Rules  as  they
    related to foreign citizens with a medical qualification that  did  not
    originate from a UK institution.  The House of  Lords  found  that  the
    Immigration Rules were a statement  by  the  Respondent  how  she  will
    exercise powers of control over immigration. The most  natural  reading
    was to apply to the decisions she makes the Rules in existence  at  the
    date of decision until such time as  she  promulgates  different  Rules
    (per Lord Hoffman).  In the absence of a specific transitional or other
    saving provision an application is to be assessed under the Immigration
    Rules as at the date of decision and not the date of application.

39.   The  importance  of  this  is  the  bearing  which  it  has   on   the
    proportionality exercise.  Since the Appellant cannot succeed under the
    Rules he must show compelling reasons why this appeal should be allowed
    outside the Rules.  The compelling  reasons  he  puts  forward  are  in
    essence:

(i)  That it would be harsh to expect  the  Sponsor  to  relocate  with  the
    Appellant back to Nigeria. If he returned alone he could not apply  for
    re-entry and this would break up the family unit.

    (ii) That the return of the Appellant to  Nigeria  would  have  serious
         consequences for the health of the  Appellant's  mother-in-law  and
         that the Sponsor's cousin P would also be adversely affected.

    (iii)    That the Appellant has established  a  private  life  in  this
         country and would find it difficult to accommodate or find  another
         job for himself in his country of origin.

40.  The Sponsor has some knowledge of Nigeria  already  since  she  visited
    the Appellant five times in the two  years  that  he  was  out  of  the
    country before being granted discretionary leave to enter.  It  appears
    that some of those visits had  unfortunate  consequences  including  an
    unpleasant incident with the Nigerian police and two bouts of  illness.
    Nevertheless the Sponsor herself has shown an aptitude for  living  and
    working abroad, on her own case she has made  a  number  of  visits  to
    Bahrain and has worked there for a year.  She has shown an  ability  to
    adapt to different  circumstances.   There  is  no  country  of  origin
    information put before me which  suggests  that  there  is  a  risk  of
    treatment contrary to Article 3 for any UK citizen who might travel  to
    live in Nigeria.  That being so, I find  it  difficult  to  accept  the
    argument that it would be unduly harsh for the  Sponsor  to  travel  to
    Nigeria with the Appellant.

41.  I accept that this is not an appropriate case where it  could  be  said
    that the Appellant  should  return  to  Nigeria  and  apply  for  entry
    clearance from there.  The effect of paragraph 322(1C) is  that  he  is
    barred from returning to this country for fifteen years from  the  date
    of conviction which will not be  for  another  seven  or  eight  years.
    Nevertheless I do not accept that this consequence of itself makes  the
    Respondent's decision disproportionate since  otherwise  paragraph  322
    (1C) would be rendered null and void.  No  challenge  has  successfully
    been made to the paragraph.

42.  In relation to the Sponsor's mother, it  is  clear  from  the  evidence
    that she has a number of other adult children living  in  the  Brighton
    area who could  assist  her  if  necessary.   If  her  health  problems
    significantly decline she would be able  to  access  further  treatment
    under the NHS (as she has done in the  past)  and/or  Social  Services.
    Nor do I consider that the effect on the Sponsor's cousin P is of  such
    weight that it has a significant  impact  in  this  case.  Neither  the
    Appellant nor the Sponsor have a parental  relationship  with  P.   P's
    best interests are to continue to be  looked  after  by  the  Sponsor's
    uncle and aunt under the terms of the Special  Guardianship  Order  and
    that will not change as a result of  the  Appellant's  removal.   As  P
    grows older no doubt she could maintain contact  with  her  cousin  the
    Sponsor and the Appellant through modern means of communication but for
    the reasons which I have given I  do  not  consider  that  that  weighs
    significantly in this case.

43.  The Appellant's private life private life accrued in  this  country  in
    three periods.  The first was during the period of his visit visa  when
    he first  arrived,  the  second  was  during  his  period  of  overstay
    including his prison sentence and the third was upon return to  the  UK
    when he had discretionary leave for a period of two years.  Thus  there
    is a combination of unlawful presence and a precarious status whilst on
    discretionary leave.  None of this is to be afforded significant weight
    in the proportionality exercise in assessing the interference with  the
    Appellant's private life.  It is  correct  that  if  the  Appellant  is
    removed to Nigeria he will not be able to continue his  employment  but
    as the Court of Appeal pointed out in Agyarko that is not of itself  of
    great significance.

44.  In the event that there may be further difficulties for the Sponsor  in
    relocating to Nigeria with the Appellant, it is clear given  the  close
    bond between the parties and the frequency of the Sponsor's  visits  to
    Nigeria that with assistance from the Appellant the Sponsor  should  be
    able to adjust to life in that country where an  official  language  is
    English.  The Appellant himself has spent a substantial amount  of  his
    own life in Nigeria and I have no doubt that he has not lost  any  ties
    with that country.  He still has family in Nigeria.   He  was  able  to
    live for over two years in Nigeria before obtaining a visa to return to
    this country and that resourcefulness will no doubt stand him  in  good
    stead upon return to his country of origin.

45.  A married couple cannot pick and choose  the  country  where  they  are
    going to enjoy their family life together.  The greater  weight  placed
    on the Respondent's side of the scales means that the Appellant  cannot
    show compelling circumstances in this case such that the effect on  the
    Appellant's  private  and  family  life  in  this  country   would   be
    disproportionate.  I  therefore  dismiss  the  appeal  under  both  the
    Immigration Rules and Article 8.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and has been  set  aside.   I  remake  the  decision  in  this  case  by
dismissing the appeal under the Immigration Rules and Article 8.

Appellant's appeal dismissed.

I make no anonymity direction as there is no public  policy  reason  for  so
doing.
