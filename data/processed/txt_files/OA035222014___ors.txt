                         (anonymity ORDER NOT MADE)
                                                                 Respondents


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr E K Mahmood, Legal representative


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant in this case is the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department.  However, for the sake of clarity, I shall use  the  titles
    by which the parties were known before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  with
    the Secretary of State referred to as  "the  respondent".   Accordingly
    Mrs Shoukat, Mr Malik and  Miss  Malik  will  be  referred  to  as  the
    appellants.

 2. No order for anonymity has been made hitherto in these proceedings  and
    no application was made before me today.  There is no need for such  an
    order.

 3. The appellants are citizens  of  Pakistan,  born,  respectively  on  18
    August 1979, 14 May 2009 and 9 September 2007.  The first appellant  is
    the mother of the second and third appellants.

 4. They applied on 28 September  2013  for  entry  clearance.   The  first
    appellant's application was under Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules
    HC 395 (as amended).  Those  applications  were  subsequently  refused,
    although, for reasons not entirely clear to the Judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal, there are two refusal decisions dated 13  February  2014  and
    then 20 October 2014.  The basis for each of  those  decisions  is  the
    same and the  appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  therefore
    against them both.

 5. The appellants' appeal was heard by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Youngerwood who in a decision promulgated on 14  January  2015  allowed
    the appellants' appeals.  The respondent sought  permission  to  appeal
    relying on Section 13 of Appendix FM-SE on the basis that the judge had
    failed to  have  adequate  regard  to  the  requirements  thereof  with
    particular reference to Section 13(b)(ii).

 6. That application was considered and granted by Judge of the  First-tier
    Tribunal Landes who gave her reasons for so doing on 20 February  2015.
    They are :-

         "1.   This  is  an  in-time  application  by  the  respondent   for
             permission to appeal against the  decision  of  Judge  of  the
             First-tier Tribunal Youngerwood promulgated on 14 January 2015
             allowing  the  appeal  of  the  appellants,  a  wife  and  two
             children, against the entry clearance  officer's  decision  to
             refuse them entry clearance.

          2. The grounds submit that the judge erred  in  his  approach  to
             Appendix FM-SE-SE section 13(b), the  applicable  section,  as
             the sponsor had been in salaried employment for less than  six
             months at the date of the application  and  the  actual  gross
             salary had to be considered rather than an  extrapolation  and
             self-employed  earnings  cannot  be  taken  into  account   as
             specified documents were not provided.

          3. The sponsor had been self-employed before he became  employed.
             He only became employed in the month before the application  .
             Although the judge accepted at [16] the amount of the earnings
             from  self-employment  which  was  above   the   appendix   FM
             requirement, he also found  that  the  specified  evidence  in
             relation to self-employment had not been provided  [14].   The
             judge however extrapolated from the two pay slips provided  to
             find that the yearly salary would satisfy the rules [15].

          4. It is arguable that the "gross annual salary  from  employment
             as at the date of application" was only that on  the  two  pay
             slips as argued in the grounds.  Of course, income from  self-
             employment can be considered as well but  then  the  specified
             documents need to be provided and the judge found they had not
             been.  Even if contrary to  what  is  argued  in  the  grounds
             "gross annual  salary  from  employment  as  at  the  date  of
             application"  permits  extrapolation,  the   requirements   of
             section 15 of Appendix FM-SE must also be met (see the end  of
             13(b)) which means that it must also be  shown  (by  providing
             the specified documents) that the leave required  by  Appendix
             FM-SE has been met in the 12 months prior to the  application.
             As the specified documents relating  to  self-employment  were
             not provided, it is  arguable  that  on  any  construction  of
             section 13 of Appendix FM-SE the judge erred in law."

 7. Thus the  appeals  came  before  me  today.   There  was  some  initial
    confusion as the respondent at paragraph 3 of a letter to the  Tribunal
    dated 2 March 2015,  pursuant  to  Rule  24,  makes  reference  to  the
    appellants having cross-appealed.  Mr Mahmood was somewhat surprised by
    this.  Moreover he indicated to me that he had no material  before  him
    regarding the permission to appeal process beyond a notice  of  hearing
    for today.  I therefore adjourned for 30 minutes  having  provided  him
    with the appropriate documentation for consideration and to enable both
    representatives to discuss the position.

 8. Upon resuming I was informed by Mr Tufan that he withdrew any aspect of
    the appeals before me beyond the respondent's challenge to the  judge's
    decision allowing the appellants' appeals.  Mr Mahmood  confirmed  that
    no challenge had been made by  the  appellants  to  that  decision.   I
    therefore proceeded to deal with the appeals on the basis of the  grant
    of permission of Judge Landes dated 20 February 2015.

 9. It is helpful if I set out Sections 13 and 15 of Appendix  FM-SE.  They
    state:-

         "13.  Based  on  evidence  that  meets  the  requirements  of  this
             Appendix, and can be taken into account with reference to  the
             applicable provisions of  Appendix  FM,  gross  annual  income
             under paragraphs E-ECP.3.1., E-LTRP.3.1.,  E-ECC.2.1.  and  E-
             LTRC.2.1. will be calculated in the following ways:

             (a)  Where the person is in salaried employment in the  UK  at
                  the date  of  application,  has  been  employed  by  their
                  current employer for at least 6 months and has  been  paid
                  throughout the period of 6 months prior  to  the  date  of
                  application at a level of gross annual salary which equals
                  or exceeds the level relied upon  in  paragraph  13(a)(i),
                  their gross annual income will be (where  paragraph  13(b)
                  does not apply) the total of:

                  (i)  The level of gross annual salary relied upon  in  the
                      application;

                  (ii) The gross  amount  of  any  specified  non-employment
                      income (other than pension income) received  by  them
                      or their partner in the 12 months prior to  the  date
                      of application; and

                  (iii)    The gross annual income  from  a  UK  or  foreign
                      State pension or a private pension received  by  them
                      or their partner.

             (b)  Where the person is in salaried employment in the  UK  at
                  the date of application and has  been  employed  by  their
                  current employer for less than 6 months  (or  at  least  6
                  months but the person does not rely on  paragraph  13(a)),
                  their gross annual income will be the total of:

                  (i)  The gross annual salary from employment as it was  at
                      the date of application;

                  (ii) The gross  amount  of  any  specified  non-employment
                      income (other than pension income) received  by  them
                      or their partner in the 12 months prior to  the  date
                      of application; and

                  (iii)    The gross annual income  from  a  UK  or  foreign
                      State pension or a private pension received  by  them
                      or their partner.

             In addition, the requirements of paragraph 15 must be met.

             (c)  Where the  person  is  the  applicant's  partner,  is  in
                  salaried employment outside of  the  UK  at  the  date  of
                  application, has been employed by their  current  employer
                  for at least 6 months, and is returning to the UK to  take
                  up salaried employment in the UK starting within 3  months
                  of their return, the person's gross annual income will  be
                  calculated:

                  (i)  On the basis set out in paragraph 13(a); and also

                  (ii) On that basis but substituting for the  gross  annual
                      salary at paragraph 13(a)(i) the gross annual  salary
                      in the salaried employment in the UK  to  which  they
                      are returning.

             (d)  Where the person is the applicant's partner, has been  in
                  salaried employment outside of the UK within 12 months  of
                  the date of application, and is returning  to  the  UK  to
                  take up salaried employment in the UK  starting  within  3
                  months of their return, the person's gross  annual  income
                  will be calculated:

                  (i)    On  the  basis  set  out  in  paragraph  13(a)  but
                      substituting for the gross annual salary at paragraph
                      13(a)(i) the gross  annual  salary  in  the  salaried
                      employment in the UK to which they are returning; and
                      also

                  (ii) On the basis set out in paragraph 15(b).

             (e)  Where the person is  self-employed,  their  gross  annual
                  income will be the total of their gross income from  their
                  self-employment,  from  any   salaried   or   non-salaried
                  employment they have had or  their  partner  has  had  (if
                  their partner is in the UK with permission to work),  from
                  specified non-employment income received by them or  their
                  partner, and from  income  from  a  UK  or  foreign  State
                  pension or a private pension received  by  them  or  their
                  partner, in the last full financial year or as an  average
                  of the last two full financial years. The requirements  of
                  this Appendix for specified  evidence  relating  to  these
                  forms of income shall apply as if references to  the  date
                  of application were references to the end of the  relevant
                  financial year(s). The relevant financial  year(s)  cannot
                  be combined with any financial year(s) to which  paragraph
                  9 applies and vice versa.

             (f)  Where the person is self-employed,  they  cannot  combine
                  their  gross  annual  income  at  paragraph   13(e)   with
                  specified savings in order to meet  the  level  of  income
                  required under Appendix FM.

             (g)  Where the person is not relying on income  from  salaried
                  employment or self-employment, their gross  annual  income
                  will be the total of:

                  (i)  The gross  amount  of  any  specified  non-employment
                      income (other than pension income) received  by  them
                      or their partner in the 12 months prior to  the  date
                      of application; and

                  (ii) The gross annual income from a UK  or  foreign  State
                      pension or a private  pension  received  by  them  or
                      their partner.

             (h)  Where the person is the applicant's  partner  and  is  in
                  self-employment outside the UK at the date of  application
                  and is returning to the UK to take up salaried  employment
                  in the UK starting within 3 months of  their  return,  the
                  person's gross annual income will be calculated:

                  (i)   On  the  basis  set  out  in  paragraph  13(a)   but
                      substituting for the gross annual salary at paragraph
                      13(a)(i) the gross  annual  salary  in  the  salaried
                      employment in the UK to which they are returning; and
                      also

                  (ii) On the basis set out in paragraph 13(e).

             (i)  Any period  of  unpaid  maternity,  paternity,  adoption,
                  parental or sick leave in the 12 months prior to the  date
                  of application will not  be  counted  towards  any  period
                  relating to employment, or any period relating  to  income
                  from employment, for which this Appendix provides.

             (j)  The provisions of  paragraph  13  which  apply  to  self-
                  employment and to a person who is self-employed also apply
                  to income from  employment  and/or  shares  in  a  limited
                  company based in the UK of a type  to  which  paragraph  9
                  applies and to a person in receipt of such income.

             (k)  Where the application relies on the employment income  of
                  the applicant and the sponsor, all of that income must  be
                  calculated either under subparagraph 13(a) or  under  sub-
                  paragraph  13(b)  and  paragraph  15,  and  not  under   a
                  combination of these methods.

         14.  Where the requirements of this Appendix and  Appendix  FM  are
             met by the combined income or cash savings of  more  than  one
             person, the income or the cash savings must  only  be  counted
             once unless stated otherwise."

10. The nub of Mr Tufan's submissions was to rely on  the  grounds  seeking
    permission to appeal and in particular as the judge found at  paragraph
    14 of his decision that the specified evidence  in  relation  to  self-
    employment had not been provided the absence of wage  slips  meant  the
    appellants could not provide specified documentation as required by the
    Immigration Rules and that the judge had erred in applying a multiplier
    to the wage slips that he had in order to calculate an annual income.

11. Mr Mahmood vehemently argued that these submissions should be  rejected
    by me.  He made repeated  references  to  the  decision  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Manager and the material referred to therein but with  little
    reference to the issues falling to me  to  decide.   He  was  concerned
    about that material.  It did seem that the respondent's  bundle  before
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge was far more substantial than  that  held
    by Mr Mahmood but that in itself does not go to the crux of the  matter
    before me.  Mr Mahmood urged me to accept that the judge's approach was
    a correct one in all the circumstances  as  otherwise  the  Immigration
    Rule itself "makes no sense".

12. The position in this appeal was that the sponsor had been self-employed
    prior to entering into employment.  He  only  became  employed  in  the
    month preceding the application.  The judge made a clear  finding  that
    specified  evidence  in  relation  to  self-employment  had  not   been
    provided.  This is his conclusion at paragraph 14 of the decision.   It
    was thereafter that he extrapolated from the two payslips  provided  an
    annual salary of �26,988 per year.  This is the applied analysis  shown
    at paragraph 15 of his decision where he refers  to  the  two  payslips
    which were provided which showed fortnightly  payment  with  the  total
    gross figure for the first month of the sponsor's employment of �2,249.
     In the following paragraph the  judge  concludes  therefore  that  the
    salaried employment in excess of �26,000 per year of  the  sponsor  was
    sufficient to meet the income threshold relevant to this appeal.

13. Whilst the income from self-employment can also be taken  into  account
    there  is  in  this  decision  a  clear  finding  that   no   specified
    documentation in relation thereto was provided.

14. It is clear from  the  Immigration  Rules  that  extrapolation  is  not
    permissible in the absence of specified documentation.  Income must  be
    shown by reference to specified documents that the financial  threshold
    required by Appendix FM has been met in the twelve months prior to  the
    date of application.  That evidence was not before the  judge  in  this
    appeal.  There was also no  specified  documentation  relating  to  the
    sponsor's self-employment so in any  event  this  was  an  appeal  that
    inevitably fell to be dismissed.

Conclusions

 1. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

 2. I set aside the decision.

 3. I re-make the decision in the appeals by dismissing them.

 4. Anonymity orders not made.
