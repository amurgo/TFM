                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Doyle made following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 19th February 2014.

 2. The background to this case is as follows.  The claimant is  a  citizen
    of the Philippines who was born on 28th August 1973.  She  entered  the
    UK on 2nd September 2008 as a student and her  leave  was  extended  so
    that she had leave to remain valid until 22nd March 2013.

 3. On 5th March 2013 she submitted an application to vary leave to  remain
    in the UK on discretionary grounds which was refused on 4th  June  2013
    and it is this decision which was the subject of  appeal  before  Judge
    Doyle.

 4. The judge recorded that in or around February 2013 the claimant  met  a
    British citizen, Michael Rowell, and a relationship  developed  between
    them. She lived with him in a two  bedroom  property  with  two  of  Mr
    Rowell's sons from a previous relationship.  There is some confusion in
    the evidence in relation to  those  sons  in  that  in  the  claimant's
    witness statement she said that the oldest son lived  with  them  full-
    time and the other two shared houses between  their  father  and  their
    mother, whereas her fianc� said that the  two  younger  children  lived
    with him and the claimant.

 5. The judge said that it was beyond dispute that the claimant  could  not
    fulfil the requirements of paragraph 276ADE of  the  Immigration  Rules
    since she has not lived in the UK for at least 20 years.   Neither  can
    she meet the requirements of Appendix FM either as a partner  or  as  a
    fianc�e and therefore cannot take advantage  of  any  exceptions  under
    EX1.

 6. The judge was struck by the sincerity of the  oral  evidence  from  the
    claimant and from Mr Rowell and.  Mr Rowell was  born  in  the  UK  and
    lived his entire life here, brought up his sons  here  and  established
    his business here.  He said that he would maintain the relationship  if
    the claimant was returned to the Philippines and would consider  moving
    there to be with her.  The claimant and Mr  Rowell  have  set  up  home
    together and have lived together, albeit for less then  twelve  months.
    Mr Rowell's youngest son was approaching his 18th  birthday  there  was
    family life not only between  the  claimant  and  Mr  Rowell  but  also
    between the claimant and the sons.

 7. Article 8 was engaged. He took  into  account  the  relevant  case  law
    including that of Chikwamba v Secretary of State  [2008]  UKHL  40  and
    said that implementing the Secretary of State's  decision  would  force
    separation on the couple. The claimant would  have  to  return  to  the
    Philippines and whilst she could  apply  to  return  to  the  UK  as  a
    fianc�e, the Secretary of State has not explained why  the  Appellant's
    separation and consequent  delay  was  necessary.  There  was  adequate
    accommodation and the claimant had maintained herself without  recourse
    to public funds for the last five years.

 8. He concluded that there  was  no  reliable  evidence  to  explain  what
    purposes would be served in forcing separation on the claimant  and  Mr
    Rowell, nor  why her removal would  be   necessary.  The  Secretary  of
    State  had  failed  to  discharge   the  burden  of  proving  that  the
    interference was necessary  or  proportionate  and  on  that  basis  he
    allowed the appeal.



The grounds of application

 9. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal relying on the  case
    of  MF  (Nigeria)  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192  which  confirmed  that  the
    Immigration Rules were a complete code, forming the starting point  for
    the decision maker. It was made clear in Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 that
    an Article 8 assessment should only  be  carried  out  when  there  are
    compelling circumstances not recognised by the Rules.  In this case the
    Tribunal had not identified such circumstances and  the  findings  were
    unsustainable.

10. Gulshan made it clear that an appeal should only be allowed where there
    were exceptional circumstances, in reliance on the case of Nagre [2013]
    EWHC 720 which endorsed  the  Secretary  of  State's  guidance  on  the
    meaning of exceptional circumstances, i.e. where refusal would lead  to
    an unjustifiably harsh outcome. The claimant had begun her relationship
    in the full knowledge that her  stay  was  temporary  and  she  may  be
    required to leave.  It had only commenced around February 2013 and  was
    not one akin to marriage.

11. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Plimmer on 17th  March  2013.
    She said that it was arguable that, in considering that  there  was  no
    reliable evidence to explain the purpose of separating the claimant and
    her spouse, the judge had failed to take into account the Secretary  of
    State's position that the Rules were not met and in those circumstances
    an unjustifiably harsh outcome ought to have been identified.

Submissions

12. Mr Deller relied on his grounds and on the  grant  of  permission.   He
    submitted that although the judge had made reference to the  fact  that
    the claimant could not meet the requirements of the Rules, he  had  not
    approached the decision in the light  of  the  fact  that  they  are  a
    complete code, and a consistent transparent and fair application of the
    Immigration Rules.  The judge had  not  proper  regard  to  the  public
    interest as identified in the Rules,  nor  to  the  fact  that  if  the
    requirements of the Rules were  not  met,  it  was  necessary  for  the
    claimant to establish compelling circumstances.  The judge had  adopted
    the wrong approach in simply saying that there  was  no  need  for  the
    claimant to leave the country and apply  for  entry  clearance  in  the
    normal way.

13. Miss Dzuiti defended the determination.  She said that  the  judge  had
    considered the position under the Immigration Rules but it was  not  in
    dispute that they could not be complied with.  The judge had then asked
    himself the correct questions, had been guided by the case law, and was
    entitled to  conclude  that  the  Secretary  of  State  had  failed  to
    establish why it was necessary for her to go  to  the  Philippines  and
    apply for entry clearance.  The judge was entitled to rely on the  fact
    that Mr Rowell had a minor child who was 17 at the time of the  hearing
    and who could not be left.  She said that she now had evidence that the
    claimant was pregnant and in fact had been  at the time of the  hearing
    although she was unaware of that fact.  If she had  to  return  to  the
    Philippines there would be a substantial delay.

14. By way of reply Mr Deller submitted that it was insufficient to  simply
    refer to the fact that Mr Rowell had a child who  was  approaching  the
    age of 18.  His situation had to be considered in  the  round  and  the
    claimant would still have to demonstrate an adverse effect  on  her  by
    being required to apply for entry clearance.

Findings and conclusions

15. Mr Deller's submissions have  force. The position so far as  Article  8
    is concerned has been  changed by the introduction of the new Rules and
    the case law has reflected that  change.  In  particular  the  case  of
    Gulshan which says in terms that, after applying  the  requirements  of
    the Rules, only if there may be  arguably  good  grounds  for  granting
    leave to remain outside them was it necessary for Article 8 purposes to
    go on to consider  whether  there  were  compelling  circumstances  not
    sufficiently recognised under them.. In the absence  of  insurmountable
    obstacles it was necessary to  show other non-standard  and  particular
    features demonstrating that removal would be  unjustifiably  harsh.  No
    compelling circumstances were identified by the  judge  and  none  have
    been identified today.

16. In this case the judge did not approach his consideration of Article  8
    through the prism of the relevant case law, in particular Gulshan.

17. The fact of the pregnancy was not before the judge and not  taken  into
    account by him since it was unknown to the claimant herself.

18. So far as the family of Mr Rowell is concerned, in fact the evidence is
    discrepant as to who was living with who, but in any  event,  the  mere
    fact that Mr Rowell has a child who is approaching  his  18th  birthday
    and may or may not be living with him but has close contact with him is
    not, as Mr Deller put it, a train stopping event.  The claimant has the
    opportunity of returning to the  Philippines  and  applying  for  entry
    clearance in the normal way. Accordingly the  Secretary  of  State  has
    established that it  would  not  be  disproportionate  for  her  to  be
    removed.

Decision

19. The judge erred in law and his decision is set  aside.  A  decision  is
    substituted dismissing the appeal.
