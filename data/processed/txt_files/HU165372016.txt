Co solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against  the  decision  of
   the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  the  claimant's  appeal  under   the
   Immigration Rules HC395 (as amended) against her decision to  refuse  him
   leave to remain as the spouse of a person  present  and  settled  in  the
   United Kingdom.  The claimant is a citizen of India.

Background

2. The claimant came to the United Kingdom as a student on 8 May 2012,  with
   leave on that basis which expired on 31 July 2015.  On 30 July 2015,  one
   day before the expiry of his leave, the claimant submitted an application
   on form FLR(FP).  That application was rejected as invalid on 13  October
   2015.  On 19 September 2015, the claimant married his  wife  in  a  civil
   ceremony recognised by United Kingdom law.

3. On 3 November 2015, the claimant made an FLR(M) application on the  basis
   that he was the spouse of a person present  and  settled  in  the  United
   Kingdom and that his removal to India would be a disproportionate  breach
   of his human rights.  The claimant relied on evidence of his own and  his
   new wife's income, which at the  date  of  application  was  a  total  of
   �6324.75 from two employments for the  claimant's  wife,  and  a  further
   �2833.99 for the claimant's own income. On 23 March  2016,  the  claimant
   purported to vary his application, but the purported variation was to the
   same  type  of  application.   He  wished   to   update   his   financial
   circumstances to those which existed in March  2016,  rather  than  those
   which accompanied the November 2015 application.

4. In her letter of 20 June 2016, the respondent  dealt  with  the  November
   2015 application.  She accepted that the claimant  and  his  wife  had  a
   genuine and subsisting  marital  relationship,  and  that  his  wife  was
   present and settled as the Rules required. The  suitability  requirements
   were also met. However, she refused the application because  the  minimum
   income of �18600 was not reached.

5. The claimant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

First-tier Tribunal decision

6. The First-tier Tribunal Judge treated the March  2016  application  as  a
   variation of  the  November  2015  application.   He  recorded  that  the
   claimant's wife was now earning �13,836 from two  employments,  with  the
   claimant's income now �6968.04.  He found that the minimum  income  level
   of �18600 was met and allowed the appeal, concluding that  the  Secretary
   of State had overlooked the variation application of March 2016.

Permission to appeal

7. Permission to appeal was granted, the Secretary of State contending  that
   the purported variation was ineffective under rule 34E of the Rules, with
   the March  2016  application  really  no  more  than  the  submission  of
   additional documents in support of the November 2015 spouse  application;
   and in addition, because the calculation of income in both November  2015
   and March 2016 should have omitted the claimant's income, as he no longer
   had extant leave and had no right to work.

Rule 24 Reply

8. There was no Rule 24 Reply.

9. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Upper Tribunal hearing

10. At the Upper Tribunal hearing,  Ms  Cleghorn  said  that  she  had  been
   instructed late and had not prepared a skeleton argument  for  the  Upper
   Tribunal. She relied on her skeleton argument for the First-tier Tribunal
   hearing.   She sought to adduce further documents relating to the  wife's
   present income, which had not been the subject of  an  application  under
   paragraph 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
   (as amended), nor were they of relevance to the parties'  income  at  the
   date of application.  I refused to admit that evidence.

11. Ms Cleghorn relied  on  Parveen  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
   Department [2018] EWCA Civ 932 at [27] and argued that the  circumstances
   here were analogous.

12. I did not consider  it  necessary  to  call  on  Ms  Petterson  for  the
   Secretary of State.

Discussion

13. The  first  question  is  which  was  the  relevant  application.  I  am
   satisfied  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  made  an  error  of  law   in
   determining that it was the March 2016  application.   Rule  34E  of  the
   Rules provides for variation of applications in the following terms:

         "Variation of Applications or Claims for Leave to Remain
         34E. If a person wishes to vary the purpose of an  application  for
         leave to remain in the United Kingdom, the  variation  must  comply
         with the requirements of paragraph 34 (as they apply  at  the  date
         the variation is made) as if the variation were a new  application.
         If it does not, subject to paragraph 34B,  the  variation  will  be
         invalid and will not be considered.
         34F. Any valid variation of a leave to remain application  will  be
         decided in accordance with the immigration rules in  force  at  the
         date such variation is made."

14. The claimant in this appeal did not seek  to  vary  the  purpose  of  an
   application for leave to remain.  He was seeking  to  vary  the  date  of
   assessment and the evidence on which that assessment was made, but he was
   still making an FLR(M) application for leave to remain as a  spouse.   He
   could have withdrawn the November  2015  application  and  made  a  fresh
   application, but he did not do so.

15.  The  respondent  therefore  correctly  considered  the  November   2015
   evidence and concluded that the income requirement was not met.

16. I have considered the effect of the decision of the Court of  Appeal  in
   Parveen on leave to remain  outside  the  Rules.  The  facts  there  were
   different: Lord Justice Underhill (with whom  Lady  Justice  Gloster  and
   Lady Justice Asplin agreed), approached the appeal on the basis that  the
   appellant had entered the United Kingdom perfectly lawfully and genuinely
   on a spouse visa and had remained married to her husband and resident  in
   the United Kingdom ever since, as opposed to  'the  usual  run  of  cases
   where an illegal entrant or overstayer who has come to the United Kingdom
   as, say, a visitor or student seeks leave to remain on  the  basis  of  a
   marriage contracted while their status was (at best)  precarious'.   That
   is the factual  matrix  of  this  appeal:  the  claimant  contracted  his
   marriage to his wife when he had no extant leave and his  status  in  the
   United Kingdom was unlawful and/or precarious.

17. At [28], Lord Justice Underhill revisited the 'certain to succeed'  test
   in Chikwamba v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 40,
   [2008] 1 WLR 1420.  He set out  the  questions  he  considered  that  the
   Secretary of State would want to ask herself in such cases:

         "... On an application of this kind I would expect the Secretary of
         State to want to consider at least the following points:
         (a) whether the Appellant would, if she  had  made  an  application
         before the expiry of her leave to enter  in  May  2001,  have  been
         entitled to leave to remain and, in due course, indefinite leave to
         remain;
         (b) whether there was a good, or at least venial,  reason  for  her
         failure to make such an application;
         (c) whether she continues to satisfy the  substantive  requirements
         for leave to remain as a spouse; and
         (d) whether it would cause real disruption for her to have to leave
         the country to make now from abroad the application that she should
         have made before 25 May 2001 and  which  would  (if  point  (c)  is
         correct) be certain to succeed."

18. This claimant does not assert that before the expiry  of  his  leave  to
   remain in July 2015, he was entitled to leave to remain as a spouse.   He
   was not married then.  That is a good reason for his not having made  the
   application at the time.  Paragraph (c) falls away and the  claimant  has
   not come close to showing that his application  from  overseas  would  be
   certain to succeed. At [28], Lord Justice Underhill makes it  clear  that
   Chikwamba continues to require a very strong case, which on the facts  of
   Parveen was much more likely than in the present application:

         "28.  For the avoidance of doubt, I do not say that  the  Appellant
         would have to tick all of boxes (a)-(d) in order for it to be right
         for her to be granted leave to remain outside the  Rules.  However,
         if she can do so it seems to me that she would have a  very  strong
         case. It is hard to see how it could be  right  to  insist  on  the
         empty but disruptive formality of leaving the country in  order  to
         correct  a  venial  administrative  error   made   thirteen   years
         previously: see  Chikwamba  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department [2008] UKHL 40, [2008] 1 WLR 1420,  and  the  subsequent
         authorities."

19. In this case, there was no venial administrative error made  years  ago.
   The claimant married his wife when he had no leave to  remain  and  their
   income did not meet the �18600  requirement.  Further,  at  the  date  of
   application the claimant had no extant leave.  His leave  expired  on  31
   July 2015 and  the  making  of  an  application  which  was  rejected  as
   incomplete did not extend any 3C leave beyond that  date.   The  claimant
   was in the United Kingdom without leave thereafter and certainly  without
   permission to work, so any income relied upon  on  his  side  was  earned
   unlawfully.  On that basis, even the March 2016 application (had it  been
   a valid application) would have been bound to fail.

20. The Secretary of State's appeal therefore succeeds and  I  substitute  a
   decision dismissing the appeal.

DECISION

21. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:
   The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error on  a
   point of law.
   I set aside the previous decision.  I remake the decision  by  dismissing
   the appeal.
