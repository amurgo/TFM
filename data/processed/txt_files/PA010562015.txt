                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr G P McGowan, of Quinn, Martin & Langan,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The appellant, a citizen of Iran, appeals against a decision  by  FtT
       Judge P A Grant-Hutchison, promulgated on 8  March  2015,  dismissing
       his appeal against refusal of recognition as a refugee.

    2. Permission was granted by the FtT on the view that  the  judge  might
       have erred in law by failing to have regard to parts of the evidence,
       failing to give adequate reasons for the finding that  the  appellant
       was not a genuine Christian convert,  and  failing  to  consider  the
       difficulties which might arise in Iran as a result of the appellant's
       marriage to a Christian and the baptism of their child.

    3. The respondent conceded that the judge failed to deal with  important
       aspects of the appellant's case, and  that  the  decision  could  not
       safely stand.

    4. Parties agreed that the outcome should be as follows.

    5. The decision of the first-tier Tribunal is set  aside.  None  of  its
       findings are to stand. The nature of the case  is  such  that  it  is
       appropriate in terms of section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007  Act  and  of
       Practice Statement 7.2 to remit the case to the  first-tier  Tribunal
       for an entirely fresh hearing.

    6. The member(s) of the first-tier Tribunal chosen to consider the  case
       are not to include Judge P A Grant-Hutchison.

    7. No anonymity order has been requested or made.
