                                Jaspal Singh

                                                                    Claimant

Representation:

For the claimant: Mr G Haque
For the appellant:     Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Jaspal Singh, date of birth  5.6.87,  is  a  citizen  of
    India.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Stokes promulgated on 4.8.14, who  allowed
    the claimant's appeal against the decision of the respondent to  refuse
    him entry clearance to the United Kingdom as a family visitor  pursuant
    to paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules.  The Judge heard  the  appeal
    on 17.7.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Davies  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    15.8.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 10.10.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Stokes should be set aside.

 6. As Judge Stokes appears to have  recognised  at  �18  and  �23  of  the
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal, in paragraph 41 appeals post-
    dating 25.6.13, there is no right of  appeal  except  on  human  rights
    and/or discrimination grounds. Whilst the  grounds  contain  an  appeal
    claim under article 8 ECHR, the  sponsor  accepted  at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing that there was no real claim in respect of private  or
    family life, but such a claim was only added to the grounds  of  appeal
    as a procedural device in order to create a full right of appeal to the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 7. In the circumstances, Judge Stokes did not consider article 8  or  make
    any decision in respect of article 8.

 8. Judge Stokes was in error  to  consider  that  this  was  an  effective
    procedural device to enable the First-tier  Tribunal  to  consider  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules. If there is no valid  human  rights
    or race relations claim, there is no  right  of  appeal  and  no  valid
    appeal before the First-tier Tribunal. Merely including a bogus article
    8 claim does not create an effective procedural  device  to  enable  an
    appellate Tribunal to reconsider  the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of
    State. In the circumstances, the judge was in error in considering  the
    application under the Immigration Rules and making a decision that  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules were met. The correct decision in
    this case is to find that there is no valid appeal and thus  no  appeal
    that can be determined.

 9. Incidentally, the judge was also in error in �22 in  finding  that  the
    decision of the Secretary of State was not in accordance with the  law.
    That  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the   application   following
    consideration of the  Rules  does  not  render  that  decision  not  in
    accordance with the law. Further, if the decision was not in accordance
    with the law, the correct approach would be to allow the appeal only to
    the limited extent that it remains for the Secretary of State to make a
    decision which is in accordance with the law.

Conclusion & Decision

10. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the  appeal  by  finding  that
                    there is no valid appeal before the Tribunal and thus no
                    appeal to be determined.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: There is no valid appeal.
