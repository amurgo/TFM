For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Parkes dated 1 June 2017 whereby he dismissed  an  appeal  against  the
    respondent's  decision  of  27  June  2016  refusing  the   appellant's
    application for leave to remain on Human Rights  (Article  8)  grounds.
    One of the key findings made  by  the  respondent  ("the  Secretary  of
    State") in deciding that the appellant did not  qualify  for  leave  to
    remain under the Immigration Rules  was  that  he  had  allegedly  used
    deception in an English language  test.   That  finding  was  based  on
    evidence supplied by the Secretary of State's  contractor,  Educational
    Testing Services (ETS). The  finding  of  deception  had  a  materially
    adverse effect upon the balancing exercise carried out under Article 8.



 2. The background can be very briefly stated.  The appellant is a national
    of Pakistan.  He married a lady who is a British citizen, and they have
    children who are also British citizens.  Both  the  appellant  and  his
    wife gave evidence at the hearing, and the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge
    also had the benefit of detailed submissions.   Among  the  submissions
    that were made on that occasion  by  Mr  Skinner  (who  represents  the
    appellant here and represented him before the First-tier Tribunal), was
    a submission that in terms of the allegation of deception the Secretary
    of State did not even get over the first  hurdle  of  showing  a  prima
    facie case.  Mr Skinner referred to a number of  the  ETS  test  cases,
    from which it emerged that there was a  three-staged  approach  to  the
    burden of proof.  Initially it was for the Secretary of State to show a
    prima facie case of deception, and then  the  evidential  burden  would
    shift to the individual applicant (or appellant)  to  come  up  with  a
    legitimate or, on  the  face  of  it,  innocent  explanation  for  what
    happened which was capable of casting doubt on  the  test  result.   It
    would then be for the Secretary of State as a matter of law to prove on
    the balance of probabilities that,  notwithstanding  that  explanation,
    deception had been used in the testing.

 3. This Tribunal has held on a number  of  occasions,  starting  with  the
    decision in SM and Qadir v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
    (ETS - Evidence - Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 00229 (IAC), a  decision
    promulgated on 21 April 2016, that certain expert evidence of a generic
    nature used by the Secretary of State in relation to ETS tests, coupled
    with specific evidence peculiar to the individuals concerned,  sufficed
    to discharge the evidential burden of proof, by establishing the  prima
    facie case of deception.  In  those  specific  cases,  the  individuals
    concerned were unable to rebut the prima facie  case  by  providing  an
    innocent explanation.  However, in those cases and in most of the cases
    that have been considered by the Tribunal since, the findings of ETS as
    a result of  listening  to  the  tapes  of  the  tests  were  that  the
    individuals concerned did not take those tests, and therefore they fell
    within a category of case where  the  test  was  termed  "invalid".   A
    finding by ETS that the  test  was  invalid  obviously  indicated  that
    somebody else  had  taken  the  test.  In  some  of  those  cases,  the
    individual concerned then adduced expert evidence indicating that there
    may be reasons to question the finding of invalidity.

 4. This case falls into a very different category, because it fell  within
    a  different  categorisation  by  ETS,  namely  that   the   test   was
    "questionable".  One of the witnesses for the Secretary of State,  Miss
    Collings, explained that for tests falling  within  the  "questionable"
    category there was no conclusive finding that  a  substitute  had  been
    used in the test itself, but rather that there was a question mark over
    the test centre as a whole.   The  question  mark  could  arise  for  a
    variety of reasons. For example, the test could have been  taken  at  a
    test centre where a very high number of candidates were  held  to  have
    had invalid tests, which might raise a very significant  question  mark
    about  the  others.   Nevertheless,  questionable  results   were   not
    something which in practice tended to be regarded by the  Secretary  of
    State as justification without more for coming  to  a  conclusion  that
    there had been  dishonesty  (at  least  in  the  later  stages  of  his
    investigations).  There was a suggestion, which was described in  Qadir
    as "a vague suggestion without  any  supporting  evidence",  that  some
    students in the "questionable" category were offered the opportunity to
    undergo the test a second time.

 5. So far as the researches of Mr Skinner have  discovered,  there  is  no
    other case in which somebody falling within the "questionable" category
    has been found to have used deception without more. The submission that
    Mr Skinner made to the First-tier Tribunal judge and  has  made  to  us
    today, is that that simply is not good enough, because it does not tell
    one anything about whether this individual used deception or not.  That
    is a powerful argument, with which this Tribunal is inclined to  agree,
    but it is unnecessary to make any clear findings about it,  because  in
    this particular case the Secretary of State did not  specifically  rely
    merely on the questionability of the test  result.   The  Secretary  of
    State also looked at the results of an interview  which  the  applicant
    was asked to undergo once it was found that the  results  of  the  test
    were questionable.

 6. Unfortunately, the evidence before  this  Tribunal  does  not  indicate
    what, if any, information was given to the applicant about the  reasons
    why this interview was going to take place.  We should say straightaway
    that we can well understand why the Home Office would  not  necessarily
    want to tip somebody off in advance that they were going  to  be  asked
    questions  about  a  language  test  which  was  questionable,  because
    forewarning them might give them the opportunity  to  come  up  with  a
    false explanation of a false test.  On the other hand, we can also  see
    the force of the point made  by  Mr  Skinner  that  one  cannot  expect
    somebody, especially if they took the test  some  two  or  three  years
    earlier, to remember all the details of the test. Therefore, if someone
    is unprepared, the extent to which the answers to the questions can  be
    held against them will be diminished if they  have  not  had  a  proper
    opportunity to consider the matter in advance of the  interview.   This
    being a case where we simply do not know what the  background  is,  the
    implication from the answers to the interview  is  that  the  appellant
    really did not have much forewarning.  In reply to the  questions  that
    he was asked, he said that he took the test about three years  earlier,
    that he chose to do the test in a place in central  London,  though  he
    did not remember the building; there were quite a lot of  other  people
    there when he took the test; and that he picked the test centre because
    the date he wished to take the test was available there and his  cousin
    lived nearby, so he did the test and then went to see his  family.   He
    could not remember how much the fee was, and he  told  the  interviewer
    that he paid it at the  counter  at  the  reception.   It  subsequently
    turned out that his cousin had paid the fee.

 7. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal  the  appellant  and  his
    wife both gave evidence that they attended the test centre on that day,
    and indeed they had supporting train tickets to establish that they did
    make that journey.  Of course, personal attendance at the  test  centre
    may, or may not, be consistent with someone actually taking  the  test.
    It is possible that somebody who cheated would attend the  test  centre
    simply to be able to give evidence that they attended it, and then  put
    in a substitute.  However, the cousin also  gave  some  evidence  about
    paying the money.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge found that there  were
    inconsistencies in that regard, but  those  inconsistencies  about  who
    paid the money and where do  not  really  shed  any  further  light  on
    whether it was the appellant or someone else who underwent the test.

 8. For the purposes of this decision we do not  need  to  make  any  final
    decision as to whether or not  the  prima  facie  case  was  made  out,
    because in our judgment the First-tier Tribunal Judge undoubtedly  fell
    into error in his approach. This was due to an assumption on  his  part
    that the decision in Qadir, to which reference has already  been  made,
    established that the generic evidence that was relied upon by the  Home
    Office was sufficient to establish a prima  facie  case  of  dishonesty
    even in a questionable case.  Mr Avery on behalf of  the  Secretary  of
    State today  very  properly  conceded  that  that  was  an  error.   He
    submitted that it was not a material error, but in  our  judgment  that
    submission really does not hold  water,  because  the  impact  of  that
    assumption must have infected the whole approach  to  the  question  of
    whether, at the end of the day, on all of the evidence,  the  Secretary
    of State had discharged the legal burden of proof  of  dishonesty.  For
    that reason alone, we must allow this appeal.

 9. In those circumstances it is, strictly speaking, unnecessary for us  to
    go on to decide the independent ground pursued by Mr Skinner  which  is
    that, even if deception were made out, the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    fell into error in relation to his approach to  the  Article  8  claim.
    However, in deference  to  counsel's  arguments  we  have  gone  on  to
    consider the points made. Mr Skinner prayed in aid the guidance of  the
    Supreme Court (which of course was given since the hearing in the First-
    tier Tribunal) in KO (Nigeria)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2018] UKSC 53 [2018] 1 WLR 5273 which stressed that in  any
    assessment of a case where an individual is not liable  to  deportation
    but is refused leave to remain, it is important to look at the test  in
    Section 117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum   Act  2002,
    and that under that test it is important to look at where  the  parents
    are expected to be located.

10. Lord Carnwath delivered a judgment with which the rest of the  Justices
    of the Supreme Court agreed. At  paragraph  19  of  that  judgment,  he
    referred to the observations made by Lewison LJ (when  considering  the
    best interests of children in the context of Section 55 of the Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009) in the case of EV  Philippines  v
    Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  874  at
    paragraph 58:-

         "In my judgment, therefore, the assessment of the best interests of
         the children must be made on the basis that the facts are  as  they
         are in the real world. If one parent has no right  to  remain,  but
         the other parent does, that is the  background  against  which  the
         assessment is conducted. If neither parent has the right to remain,
         then that  is  the  background  against  which  the  assessment  is
         conducted. Thus the ultimate question will be: is it reasonable  to
         expect the child to follow the parent with no right  to  remain  to
         the country of origin?"

    Lord Carnwath observed that, to the  extent  that  Elias  LJ  may  have
    suggested otherwise in MA (Pakistan) [2016] 1 WLR  5093,  at  paragraph
    40, he would respectfully disagree.  There is nothing in the section to
    suggest that "reasonableness" is to be considered otherwise than in the
    real world in which the children find themselves.

11.  The Supreme Court's approval of the approach adopted by Lewison LJ  in
    EV Philippines and its adoption in the context of Section 117B(6) means
    that it is important, when assessing whether it is reasonable  for  the
    children to leave,  to  consider  the  fact-specific  position  of  the
    parents: whether both the parents would be leaving if the  parent  with
    no right to remain must return to another country, or  whether,  as  in
    some cases, the other parent would stay here and if  so,  whether  they
    would stay here with the children.  That is clearly a finding that will
    depend on the facts of the individual case.

12. The position in the present case is that one simply does not know  what
    would happen.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge never really addressed the
    test under Section 117B(6).  There is no reference to  that  test,  and
    indeed insofar as he addressed the position of the children at all,  he
    seemed to be falling into the  error  of  looking  at  the  case  on  a
    factual,  Zambrano-type  basis  rather  than  addressing  the   correct
    question of whether it would be reasonable to expect the child to leave
    with the parent who would not have leave to remain.  For  that  reason,
    there is a further material error of law in the Article  8  assessment.
    The Appeal must succeed on both the grounds advanced by Mr Skinner.

13. The question for this Tribunal,  following  from  the  success  of  the
    appeal, is whether we should re-make the decision ourselves or remit it
    to the First-tier Tribunal, and if we do re-make the decision,  whether
    we should do it on this occasion.  We would observe  that  this  family
    has had to wait for a decision for quite some long period of  time  and
    it would not be in their  best  interests  if  the  matter  was  to  be
    prolonged.

14. It is acknowledged by Mr Avery on behalf of the Secretary of State that
    there are difficulties in re-making the Article  8  assessment  because
    very little information was placed before the First-tier Tribunal about
    the position of the children.  However, it does seem to us that  it  is
    possible for us to re-make the decision in relation to the question  of
    deception, and if that decision were to  be  found  in  favour  of  the
    appellant, then we would not need to go on to consider the position  of
    the appellant's children, because the appellant would have  shown  that
    he met the the Immigration Rules in any event, there would be no public
    interest weighing against him and the appeal would fall to  be  allowed
    under Article 8 ECHR.

15. We have scrutinised the evidence with some care and have concluded that
    the finding of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  that  there  had  been
    deception by the  appellant  was  wrong.  We  consider  that  there  is
    insufficient foundation for such a finding, irrespective of whether the
    Secretary of State gets over the prima facie evidential burden.  If one
    takes the evidence in the round there really is nothing, other  than  a
    lack of recollection as to who paid the fee at the counter,  to  impugn
    the appellant's credibility or his evidence of  taking  the  test,  and
    that falls a long  way  short  of  a  justification  for  finding  that
    somebody else took the test and that the appellant did not.  Given that
    he  was  present,  his  wife  says  that  he  was  present,  there  was
    corroborative evidence in the form of the train tickets, and  the  test
    is merely "questionable" for the reasons that  we  have  explained,  it
    seems to us that the Secretary of State cannot prove, on the balance of
    probabilities, that he used deception.  For that reason, we re-make the
    decision and allow under Article 8 ECHR the Appellant's appeal  against
    the Secretary of State's refusal to grant him leave to remain under the
    Immigration Rules.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As we have allowed the appeal we have decided to make a fee  award  of  �140
because it has  been  established  that  the  Appellant  complied  with  the
Immigration Rules at all material times and the allegation that he had  used
deception was based on the flimsiest of grounds.
