Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr K Norton, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    In Person


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Widdup) issued on 27 July 2015  allowing  an
    appeal by Mr Salman Umar against a decision  made  on  11  August  2014
    refusing him further leave to remain as the  husband  of  his  sponsor,
    Katherine Brook.  In this determination I will refer to the parties  as
    they were before the First-tier Tribunal, Mr Umar as the appellant  and
    the Secretary of State as the respondent.

Background

2.   The background to this appeal is that the appellant  is  a  citizen  of
    Pakistan born on 15 March 1983.  He arrived in the UK as a student on 3
    September 2009 and was granted further leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student until 29 November  2013.   On  27  November  2013  he
    applied for further leave to remain on the basis of his marriage  on  4
    July 2013 to Mrs Brook.

3.   He met the requirements for limited leave to remain save in respect  of
    the requirement of showing that the family had a specified gross annual
    income of at least �18,600.  In the decision  letter  dated  11  August
    2014 the respondent  set  out  why  she  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    appellant  had  produced  the  specified  documents  showing  that  the
    required income had been properly evidenced.

4.   The respondent went on to consider  the  position  under  Appendix  FM,
    EX.1.   She  accepted  that  there  was  a   genuine   and   subsisting
    relationship between the appellant and his  wife  and,  whilst  it  was
    acknowledged that she had lived in the UK  all  her  life  and  was  in
    employment, that did not  mean  that  they  would  be  unable  to  live
    together in Pakistan and, although relocating might cause a  degree  of
    hardship,  the  respondent  was  not  satisfied  that  there  would  be
    insurmountable  obstacles  as  defined  in  EX.2.    Accordingly,   the
    application was refused.

The Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

5.   The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and  the  appeal  was
    heard on 16 July 2015.  The appellant appeared in person and there  was
    no representation  on  behalf  of  the  respondent.   The  judge  heard
    evidence from  the  appellant  who  provided  a  witness  statement,  a
    chronology and a bundle of documents.   The  judge  accepted  that  Mrs
    Brook was in employment, was also self-employed  and  that  her  income
    from both sources for 2014 was �23,256.  He noted that for  the  period
    ending 22 November 2013 Mrs Brook's business generated a net profit  of
    �15,351 and that she was also working  as  a  sales  assistant  earning
    �13,300.  Her total earnings were therefore well in excess of  �18,600.
    In the light of the evidence produced he found that the  appellant  met
    the requirements of Appendix FM and he allowed the appeal.

The Grounds of Appeal

6.   In the grounds of appeal it is argued that in order to  show  that  the
    required income of �18,600 is met, the documents set out in Appendix FM-
    SE must be produced.  In  respect  of  self-employment  there  must  be
    evidence of the tax payable for the last full financial year as set out
    in Appendix FM-SE.  The relevant last financial year for the  appellant
    would be tax year 2012-2013 whereas the judge had  relied  on  evidence
    relating to tax year 2013-2014.

7.   In his submissions Mr Norton relied on the grounds and  the  provisions
    in paras 7 and 13(e) of Appendix FM-SE.  It was clear, so he submitted,
    from the judge's determination at paras 8, 10 and 14 that he had relied
    on income post-dating the relevant tax year and had  accordingly  erred
    in law.

8.   Mr Umar and Mrs Brook explained that they had attempted to provide  all
    the documents required by the respondent and made the point that at the
    date of the hearing they had been able to demonstrate a specified gross
    annual income of more than �18,600.  Mr  Umar  confirmed  that  in  his
    grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal he had also challenged the
    decision that they could continue their family life  in  Pakistan.   He
    argued that it would be completely unreasonable for the  respondent  to
    suggest that his wife could move to Pakistan.

The Error of Law

9.   The application for further leave to remain was  made  on  27  November
    2013 and the appellant had to meet the requirements of Appendix FM  and
    to provide the evidence set out in Appendix FM-SE  in  support  of  his
    wife's income.  The rules are clear that the evidence  must  relate  to
    the last full financial year in respect of self-employment (para 7) and
    where, as in the present case, self-employment and employment is relied
    on, the evidence must also relate to the last full financial year (para
    13(e)).  The Upper Tribunal in Hameed (Appendix FM  -  financial  year)
    [2014] UKUT 266  (IAC)  confirmed  that  the  financial  year  for  the
    purposes of Appendix FM-SE was the tax year not the year  selected  for
    accounting purposes.

10.  It follows that the judge was not entitled to  take  into  account  the
    evidence relating to earnings from employment  and  self-employment  in
    the tax year 2013-2014.  The application was made on 28  November  2013
    and the evidence needed to relate to the tax year  2012-2013.   In  [8]
    the judge referred to the tax return for  2013-2014,  in  [10]  to  Mrs
    Brook's income from both sources for 2014 and to the net profit of  the
    business for the period ending 22  November  2013  in  [15].   In  this
    respect the judge  erred  in  law  and  his  decision  on  whether  the
    financial requirements of the rules were met must be set aside.

11.  The appellant had also sought to challenge  the  respondent's  decision
    under Appendix FM, EX.1 but, in the light of the  judge's  findings  on
    the issue of finance, he did not proceed to consider that  matter.   As
    there have been no findings on that  issue  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    proper course is for it to be referred back to the First-tier  Tribunal
    for consideration of whether the appellant and his  wife  are  able  to
    meet  the  requirements  of  EX.2  in  showing  that  there  are   very
    significant difficulties  in  continuing  their  family  life  together
    outside the UK which could not be overcome or would entail very serious
    hardship for the appellant and his wife.

Decision

12.  For the reasons I  have  given  I  am  satisfied  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal erred in law and the decision is set  aside.   The  appeal  is
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for reconsideration of  the  appeal
    relating to Appendix FM, EX.1.  There  is  no  reason  why  the  appeal
    should not continue in front of Judge Widdup and I so direct save  only
    that if this is not practicable or will lead to unreasonable delay,  it
    would be appropriate for the appeal to be transferred to another First-
    tier Tribunal Judge.
