                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr. N. Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr. M. Aslam, Counsel instructed by Bond Adams LLP
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Head-Rapson, promulgated on 8 March 2018, in  which
    he allowed Mrs. Mohumed's  appeal  against  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision to refuse further leave to remain on human rights grounds.


 2. For the purposes of this decision I refer to the Secretary of State  as
    the Respondent and to Mrs. Mohumed at the Appellant,  reflecting  their
    positions as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. Permission to appeal was granted as follows:

    "Permission to appeal is granted because:


       i) as asserted the Decision disclosed an arguable lack  of  findings
          on material matters namely under EX.1(b) and  with  reference  to
          article 8;


      ii) the Decision arguably disclosed an overall lack of reasoning."


 4. The Appellant and Sponsor attended the hearing.

 5. Following a brief discussion, I stated that I found that  the  decision
    involved the making of a material error of law.   I  set  the  decision
    aside and remitted it to the First-tier Tribunal.

Error of Law

 6. Although just before [20] the Judge has put the  heading  "Findings  of
    fact", no findings follow.  The Judge sets  out  the  Appellant's  case
    from [21] to [40].  The Respondent's case is set out from [41] to [51].
     Just before [52] is the heading "Human rights".  The Judge  then  sets
    out some of the law from [52] to [58].  There is  a  reference  to  the
    Appellant at the start of [59], where the Judge  finds  that  there  is
    family life.  There is a reference to the Appellant and Sponsor in  the
    first sentence of [60], but  the  remainder  this  paragraph  considers
    caselaw.  There is then further reference to caselaw from [61] to [63].




 7. At [64] the Judge sets out his conclusion.  He finds "for  the  reasons
    given above" that the decision "was not in accordance with the law  and
    the Immigration Rules; and that requiring the Appellant  to  leave  the
    United Kingdom would breach the human rights of her  or  those  of  her
    husband".

 8. Mr. Aslam accepted that the structure of the decision was "as odd as it
    could be" but he submitted that the ingredients were there, if one  was
    to look closely enough.  He submitted  that  Judge  was  aware  of  the
    relevant immigration rule [20], and referred to matters  set  out  from
    [21] onwards.

 9. However, I find that the  problem  with  the  decision  is  not  merely
    structural.  There  are  no  findings  which  relate  to  the  specific
    circumstances of the Appellant and Sponsor.  It is clear that from [21]
    to [40] the Judge is merely setting out the  Appellant's  case.   These
    are not findings of fact.  That this is the case is made clearer by the
    fact that from [41] to [51] the judge sets out the  Respondent's  case,
    which argues against the points made in the earlier paragraphs  setting
    out the Appellant's case.  It cannot be said that [21] to  [40]  amount
    to a series of findings of fact.

10. Under the heading "Human rights", the Judge has not turned to  consider
    the Appellant's circumstances but, as  set  out  above,  in  the  seven
    paragraphs under this heading, there are only two very brief references
    to the Appellant's own situation.

11. I find that the Judge has not engaged with the Appellant's case at all.
     He has not given any or adequate consideration as to  whether  or  not
    paragraph EX.1(b) is met.  There are no findings of fact.   It  is  not
    clear to what he is referring when, at [64], he states that he has come
    to his conclusion "for the reasons given above".

12. I find that the decision involves the making of material errors of  law
    for failure to make findings, and failure to give adequate reasons  for
    the decision.  The fact that the Judge has set out the Appellant's case
    does not remove the need to make clear findings as to  which  parts  of
    that are accepted, and  which  parts  have  led  him  to  come  to  his
    conclusion.

13. I have taken account of the Practice Statement dated 10 February  2010,
    paragraph 7.2.  This contemplates that an appeal may be remitted to the
    First-tier Tribunal where the effect of the error has been to deprive a
    party before the  First-tier  Tribunal  of  a  fair  hearing  or  other
    opportunity for the party's case to be put to  and  considered  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  Given the nature and extent of  the  fact-finding
    necessary to enable this appeal to be remade, given that there  are  no
    findings, and having regard to the overriding objective, I find that it
    is appropriate to remit this case to the First-tier Tribunal.

Notice of Decision

14. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involves  the  making  of  a
    material error of law and I set the decision aside.


15. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be reheard.


16. The appeal is not to be listed before Judge Head-Rapson.

17. No anonymity direction is made.
