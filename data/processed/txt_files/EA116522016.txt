                           ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER


                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. In a decision promulgated on 1 September 2017 Judge of  the  First-
        tier Tribunal Sweet  concluded  that  he  had  no  jurisdiction  to
        entertain Mr Khan's appeal against the respondent's decision  dated
        2 September 2016 to refuse his application for an EEA family permit
        pursuant to the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
        2006. Judge Sweet's decision relied on the Upper Tribunal  decision
        of Sala [2016] UKUT 0411. This  was  overturned  by  the  Court  of
        Appeal in Khan v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2017]
        EWCA Civ 1755.


     2. In directions issued on 9 January 2018 Upper Tribunal  Judge  Bruce
        indicated that the Upper Tribunal was minded to find  an  error  of
        law, set aside the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  and  remit
        the case to the First-tier Tribunal. If either of the  parties  was
        opposed to this course they were directed to inform the Tribunal in
        writing (giving reasons), not later than 7 days from the  date  the
        Directions were issued. Following that  period,  the  parties  were
        informed that the Upper Tribunal would issue its decision.


     3. The Upper Tribunal has not received any correspondence from  either
        party within the stipulated timeframe.  In  the  light  of  Khan  v
        Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017]  EWCA  Civ  1755,
        the First-tier Tribunal was wrong in law to conclude  that  it  did
        not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal.


     4. The Upper Tribunal is consequently satisfied  that  the  First-tier
        Tribunal's decision is  marred  by  a  material  legal  error  (the
        unlawful view that it lacked jurisdiction).


Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal decision is vitiated by a  material  error  of  law.
The case is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh  (de  novo)
hearing, before a judge other than judge of the First-tier Tribunal Sweet.
