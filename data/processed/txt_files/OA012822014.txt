                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a decision of Judge Stott of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal (the FtT) promulgated on 29th December 2014.

 2. The Appellant is a female citizen of Bangladesh born 12th February 1948
    who applied for a Certificate of Entitlement to a Right of Abode in the
    UK.  The application was made on the basis that the  Appellant  is  the
    wife of the late Mozor  Miah  who  was  a  British  citizen  when  they
    married.

 3. The application was refused on 2nd December 2014.  It was not  disputed
    that Mr Miah was granted British citizenship on 1st August 1967 nor was
    it disputed that the Appellant and Mr Miah  had  undergone  a  marriage
    ceremony in Bangladesh on 28th February 1970.

 4. However the Respondent did not accept that the marriage was valid,  and
    therefore did not accept that  the  Appellant  had  married  a  British
    citizen.  This  was  because  Mr  Miah  was  already  married  when  he
    underwent a marriage ceremony with the  Appellant,  and  therefore  the
    marriage between Mr Miah and the Appellant was polygamous.

 5. If Mr Miah had maintained  his  Bangladesh  domicile  of  origin,  then
    because a polygamous marriage would be recognised  in  Bangladesh,  the
    marriage would be recognised under UK law and would be valid.   However
    the Respondent contended that Mr Miah had  established  a  domicile  of
    choice in the UK with his first wife, and because he was  domiciled  in
    the UK, rather than Bangladesh, the marriage was invalid.

 6. The Appellant appealed to the FtT  who  found  that  the  marriage  was
    invalid and therefore the Appellant was not entitled to  a  Certificate
    of Entitlement to a Right of Abode.  The FtT  found  that  although  Mr
    Miah may well have maintained land  and  assets  in  Bangladesh  for  a
    period, and that he also returned to Bangladesh on  a  periodic  basis,
    the burden of proof was on the Appellant to establish that at the  time
    of her marriage in 1970, Mr Miah still regarded Bangladesh as his  main
    and true home.  The FtT found that the Appellant had not satisfied that
    burden, and  therefore  the  Respondent  was  entitled  to  refuse  her
    application, and the appeal was dismissed.

 7. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    contending that the FtT had materially erred in law in concluding  that
    the burden of proof rested upon the Appellant.  It was  contended  that
    the burden of proof was on the Respondent, if the Respondent  contended
    that a person had abandoned his  domicile  of  origin  and  acquired  a
    domicile of choice in the UK.  It was submitted that the FtT had  erred
    materially on this issue, and the decision should be set aside.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge  O'Connor  in
    the following terms;

         "It is arguable that the FtT erred in placing  the  burden  on  the
         Appellant to prove that  the  domicile  of  her  late  husband  had
         changed from his domicile of origin to a domicile of choice, at the
         time of their marriage in  1970.   Although  the  grounds  cite  no
         authority  for  the  legal  proposition  advanced,   the   parties'
         attention is drawn to paragraph 10 of the Tribunal's  determination
         in SM (Domicile of  choice;  Scott's  law)  Pakistan  [2008]  UKAIT
         00092."

 9. Following the grant of permission  the  Respondent  lodged  a  response
    pursuant to rule 24 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 contending that the FtT had not materially erred and the  decision
    should stand.

10. Directions were subsequently issued providing for an  oral  hearing  to
    take place before the Upper Tribunal to ascertain whether the  FtT  had
    erred in law such that the decision should be set aside.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

11. Mr Mills indicated that he did not accept that the rule 24 response was
    correct in law.  Mr Mills stated that it was accepted that the FtT  had
    materially erred in law, by concluding that the burden of proof was  on
    the Appellant.  It was accepted that the burden of  proof  was  on  the
    party who asserts that there had been a change of domicile.

12. Mr Mills conceded that the decision of the FtT should be set aside  and
    re-made, and accepted that  the  Respondent  could  not  discharge  the
    burden of proof in relation to a change of domicile, and therefore  the
    appeal should be allowed.  Mr Mills indicated that he could not  oppose
    the making of a fee award in favour of the Appellant, as  the  decision
    by the Respondent to refuse the application was wrong in law.

13. Mr Khan agreed.

14. I set aside the decision of the FtT and indicated that I would  re-make
    the decision and issue a written decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

15. The decision of the FtT is set aside because the FtT erred  in  finding
    that the burden of proof was on the Appellant to prove that  Bangladesh
    was  still  the  domicile  of  her  late  husband.    The   Immigration
    Directorate's Instructions (IDI) on marriage and domicile, referred  to
    at paragraph 5 of the grounds seeking  permission  to  appeal,  confirm
    that the onus of proof is on the  party  asserting  that  a  change  of
    domicile has taken place.  If the Secretary of State considers  that  a
    polygamous marriage which took place abroad is invalid  in  the  United
    Kingdom because at the time of the marriage one party  had  acquired  a
    domicile of choice here, the onus of proof would be on the Secretary of
    State.

16. The legal position is confirmed in paragraph 10  of  SM  (Pakistan)  in
    which it was stated;

         "It is well-known that both in  English  law  and  Scots  law  and,
         indeed we understand it, the law of much of the rest of the  world,
         it is for a person who seeks to establish that a domicile of origin
         has been lost and replaced by a domicile of choice to show that."

17. Therefore because the Respondent contended that Mr Miah  had  lost  his
    domicile of origin in Bangladesh, and had acquired a domicile of choice
    in the UK, the Respondent needed to prove that.

18. As conceded by Mr Mills, the FtT materially erred  in  finding  to  the
    contrary, that the burden of proof was on the Appellant to  prove  that
    Mr Miah still had a domicile of choice in Bangladesh  at  the  time  of
    their marriage.  It is for this reason that the decision of the FtT was
    set aside.

19. I re-make the decision by  allowing  the  Appellant's  appeal  for  the
    following reasons.

20. It is accepted that Mr Miah became a British citizen on 1st August 1967
    and therefore he was a British citizen when he married the Appellant in
    Bangladesh on 28th February 1970.  It was accepted  by  the  Respondent
    that if Mr Miah still had a domicile  of  origin  in  Bangladesh,  that
    marriage was valid.

21. It follows, that if the marriage  was  valid,  then  the  Appellant  is
    entitled to succeed by reason of having married a British citizen.

22. It was accepted by Mr  Mills  that  the  Respondent  could  produce  no
    adequate evidence to prove that at the  date  of  marriage,  Mr  Miah's
    domicile of origin in Bangladesh had been replaced  by  a  domicile  of
    choice in the UK.  Therefore I conclude that as the Respondent has been
    unable to discharge the burden of  proof,  Mr  Miah  was  domiciled  in
    Bangladesh when he married the Appellant, and therefore their  marriage
    is valid, and for the  reasons  given  earlier,  this  means  that  the
    Appellant is entitled to a Certificate of Entitlement  to  a  Right  of
    Abode in the UK.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As the appeal is allowed I have considered whether to make a fee award.   It
is appropriate to make a whole fee award of ï¿½140.  The decision made by  the
Respondent to refuse the application was wrong in law which meant  that  the
Appellant had to enter an appeal.
