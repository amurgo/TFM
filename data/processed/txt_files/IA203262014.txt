                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by Sufaid  Khan,  a  citizen  of  Pakistan  born  7th
    February 1984.  He appeals  against  the  determination  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Gillespie promulgated on 17th December  2014  dismissing
    his appeal against the decision of the Respondent made  on  24th  April
    2014 to refuse further leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a  Tier
    1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant and to give directions for  his  removal  from
    the United Kingdom.

 2.  On  2nd  February  2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pooler   refused
    permission to appeal.  He noted that it was  asserted  in  the  grounds
    seeking permission that Judge Gillespie erred in law in reaching  wrong
    findings  on  the  Appellant's  business  plan,  wrongly  applying  the
    Immigration Rules, failing to consider that discretion should have been
    exercised differently and failing to consider  the  Article  8  appeal.
    Judge Pooler said that it had not been  submitted  in  the  Grounds  of
    Appeal that discretion should have been exercised differently and found
    that none of the grounds disclosed an arguable material error  of  law.
     The Appellant applied to the Upper Tribunal for permission  to  appeal
    and the appeal came before us to determine whether or not there  was  a
    material error of law in the decision of Judge Gillespie.

 3. It is submitted in the Grounds of Appeal provided to the Upper Tribunal
    that the Judge erred in concluding that the Appellant was not a genuine
    a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant in that his reasoning  is  inconsistent
    with the evidence provided by the  Appellant.   The  Judge  is  not  an
    expert on the motor trade and fails to give adequate  reasons  for  his
    findings on the viability of the  Appellant's  business.   He  did  not
    understand the business plan and proposal.  It was not open to  him  to
    make a decision that  the  proposed  business  would  not  require  the
    investment of anything like �50,000.  There was no expert report.   His
    analysis of the Appellant's business  was  not  well-reasoned  and  was
    outwith his capacity as a Judge.  The Appellant had explained that  the
    nature of his business was also with other businesses where they  would
    require a fleet of cars totalling  up  to  �45,000  but  this  was  not
    recorded by the Judge in his determination.

 4. The Secretary of State refused the Appellant's application because  she
    was not satisfied as to the genuineness of it.  The Appellant had  been
    interviewed and had   said that his  business  would  be  sourcing  and
    importing used motor vehicles or vehicle parts from  various  countries
    throughout the world and supplying these to order  of  clients  in  the
    United Kingdom.  The initial client was said to  be  a  company  called
    London Global Solutions Limited which according  to  investigations  by
    the Respondent is either not trading or trading to only a very  limited
    extent and had done since August 2011. The  Secretary  of  State  noted
    that the contract with London Global Solutions Limited does not contain
    information that you would expect from a genuine contract such  as  the
    amount that would be charged etc.   There  was  no  evidence  that  the
    Appellant had provided any of the services he claimed that he would  be
    providing.  Given that he has no evidence of trading and no  experience
    in purchasing vehicles and vehicle goods it raises the question of  why
    they would make a contract with the Appellant in the first place.   The
    Secretary of State said that the answers  the  Appellant  gave  at  the
    interview about market research lacked credibility and were  vague  and
    lacking in any kind of detail.  She took the view that he had conducted
    little or no market research.  She said  it  is  not  credible  that  a
    person who was a genuine and credible entrepreneur would have  remained
    unemployed for two years and then decide three months before their visa
    expired to create a company and then spend little or no time developing
    the business.  He was  unable  to  offer  detailed  answers  about  the
    business plan and market research.  The Secretary of State  noted  that
    the answers given by the Appellant were vague and generalised.  He made
    no mention of who his business links are and appeared to have  no  idea
    of the process of buying and importing cars  and  parts.   He  had  not
    shown that he had the skills  to  do  what  he  wanted  to  do  in  the
    business.  There was no evidence that he had attended  trade  fairs  as
    claimed.  He said that he would get local garages to do repair work but
    had no quotations from them.  Given that the advert said that he  would
    do the repair work the Secretary of State said that the adverts  appear
    to be neither viable nor credible  but  appear  to  have  been  created
    simply to support the application for leave as an entrepreneur.

 5. Judge Gillespie found that the Appellant had shown  no  established  or
    proposed links with persons who might inspect vehicles  and  report  on
    their condition and had given no satisfactory  explanation  as  to  why
    people would resort to the importation of used cars of such potentially
    uncertain standard rather than exploit the ready  stock  of  used  cars
    available without cost of inspection, import duties and  fees  in  this
    country.  He also took into account that the whole  business  plan  was
    apparently devised and made the subject  of  application  very  shortly
    before the expiry of the Appellant's leave to remain.  He had gone home
    for a time after his graduation and when he returned to Southampton had
    sought many jobs but could not get one.  Judge Gillespie concluded that
    the Appellant had no intention of establishing a  genuine  business  in
    the UK.    He said that he considered as did the  Respondent  that  the
    proposed business and the proposed customer and  trading  links  abroad
    had been contrived  for  the  purpose  of  supporting  the  application
    without any genuine intention of  investing  funds  as  stated  into  a
    viable business.

 6. At the hearing before us Mr Bridock provided a  statement  of  case  in
    which he concedes that the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal did not err
    in law by failing to take into account the business plan because it had
    been submitted following the refusal of the application.  He  therefore
    dropped Ground one. (The Ground relative to Article 8 ECHR was  not  to
    be proceeded with.)   He went on to say that  the  Secretary  of  State
    refused the application only on the grounds of genuineness but  instead
    of relying on that the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal had  relied  on
    the viability of the business which is an incorrect test.  He said that
    although he would accept that viability may go  to  credibility  it  is
    clear that Judge Gillespie gave far too much weight  to  viability  and
    indeed transposed that as the test.  For  example  at  paragraph  7  he
    accepts the business is theoretically possible but then using  his  own
    view of  the  business  suggests  that  the  business  is  not  viable.
    Similarly in paragraph 8 he suggested the business  does  not  need  an
    investment of �50,000 but it is unclear how he came to that conclusion.
     At paragraph 10 he accepted that the Appellant could make  "some  sort
    of a living" from his proposed business but then  said,  again  without
    giving  any  reasons,  that  the  business  does  not  need  a  �50,000
    investment.  It is submitted that Judge  Gillespie  used  an  incorrect
    test to assess credibility and instead assessed viability.

 7. The position of Mr Bridock was that the  Judge  mistook  viability  for
    genuineness and he put too much weight on viability.  The intention  of
    the Rule is to establish that a business  is  genuine.   He  relied  on
    paragraph 10 of the determination in which the Judge said that  he  was
    not satisfied that the Appellant had any intention of investing �50,000
    in the business, submitting that it is clear that the �50,000 would  be
    spent on stock and cars. He submitted that the  decision  was  perverse
    and irrational.

 8. In oral submissions Mr Jarvis said that the application  was  not  made
    properly.   He submitted that at paragraph 7 the reasons given  by  the
    Judge for questioning the business are satisfactory.  If the assessment
    of the evidence is considered in the  round  the  application  did  not
    indicate a viable and genuine business. There was just no evidence that
    it would work.  The Judge did not just look at viability.  He looked at
    everything in the round.

Findings on error of law

 9. In terms of paragraph 245DD an applicant for leave to remain in the  UK
    as an entrepreneur migrant has to show, inter alia

         that he genuinely intends to invest the money referred to in  Table
         4 of Appendix A in the business or businesses referred to in (i)

    It is further provided that in making her assessment the  Secretary  of
    State will assess the balance of probabilities and  take  into  account
    several factors including,

         the viability and credibility of the applicant's business plans and
         market research into their chosen business sector

         the applicant's previous educational and business experience

         the applicant's immigration history and previous activity in the UK

         any other relevant information

10. As was stated in the refusal of leave to appeal by First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Pooler it is important to note in this case that Judge  Gillespie
    was best placed to reach the decision he did having heard the Appellant
    under cross-examination.  He had heard oral evidence.  He was  able  to
    form an opinion of that evidence.  Mr  Bridock  based  his  submissions
    resolutely on the distinction between  "genuineness"  and  "viability".
    We did have some difficulty with his insistence on his view  that  this
    was crucial to the decision that the Judge made.  We are  of  the  view
    that in assessing whether or not an intention to set up as  a  business
    is genuine, viability is an important factor.  In fact Judge  Gillespie
    at paragraph  10  expresses  himself  not  to  be  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant has 'a genuine intention of investing funds as stated into  a
    viable business'. We  agree  that  Judge  Gillespie  perhaps  erred  in
    commenting as he did that the business that the Appellant  proposes  on
    his analysis of it does not require the investment of  any  substantial
    funds, certainly nothing like the �50,000 said to  be  intended  as  an
    investment, but looking at the decision in the round we do not consider
    that to be material. Again it must be remembered that  Judge  Gillespie
    heard oral evidence and it is clear from the Record of Proceedings that
    there was  good  reason  to  question  both  the  genuineness  and  the
    viability of the business. In particular, the Appellant's  sole  client
    was London Global Solutions Limited and he  said  he  had  chosen  them
    because they have seven to ten  cars.   It  is  difficult  to  see  the
    relevance of that as basis for choice.   When he was asked what sort of
    cars he would import he said he would import any car which  his  client
    requires from any price up to �40,000 both new  and  second  hand.   He
    said if he imported them he would get them cheaper  but  there  was  no
    evidence that this is so.   The evidence that the Judge had before  him
    included the transcript of the Appellant's interview in which  he  said
    that he is not a mechanic and he would pay local garages to repair  the
    cars if necessary.  The advert had  said  that  he  could  repair  cars
    cheaper than other places. He said he himself would go abroad to  check
    that the cars were roadworthy and complied with UK laws but there is no
    information on whether any specific  qualifications  are  required  for
    this and the Appellant conceded that he is not a mechanic.    There are
    letters apparently confirming that cars would  be  exported  to  Solent
    Solutioners Ltd but no financial details.   The  contract  with  London
    Global Solutions Limited was extremely  lacking  in  detail.   We  note
    incidentally that although it was  conceded  by  Mr Bridock  that  the
    business plan had not been submitted in time to the Secretary of  State
    it is in the bundle. The Judge did not take account of  it  but  it  is
    hard to see how it could have assisted the Appellant as there is not  a
    jot of reliable evidence to support any of the figures in it.

11. We had difficulty at the hearing comprehending Mr Briddock's submission
    that  Judge Gillespie  erred   in  placing   too  much  weight  on  the
    viability of the business. It seems to us that the two  are  linked  in
    paragraph 245DD (i) in relation to both the source of the funds and the
    business plans. Of course  the  business  has  to  be  genuine  but  in
    deciding whether or not it is, the  viability  of  the  business  is  a
    factor.  Clearly the Secretary of  State  based  her  decision  on  the
    interview. She noted that  the  Appellant  had  been  unable  to  offer
    detailed answers about his business  plans  and  market  research.  The
    Judge was entitled to take into account the answers to the questions at
    interview along with the  other  documents  before  him  and  the  oral
    evidence of the Appellant. Having considered that evidence we find that
    the conclusions he reached were neither  perverse  nor  irrational  and
    were open to him on the evidence before him for the reasons given.

Notice of Decision

We find that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  does  not  contain  a
material error of law and shall stand.
