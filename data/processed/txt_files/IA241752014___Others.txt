Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr Kandola, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Khan


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal with leave against the decision  made  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Camp  promulgated  on  6  November  2014  in  which  the
    respondents to this appeal, Sabar Mansoor (1),  Tariq  Mansoor  Mehmood
    (2), Hammad Ahmed (3) and Gaiqa Mansoor (4), were successful  in  their
    appeal against the decision of the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department ('the appellant') of 20 May 2014 refusing their  application
    for leave to remain and the consequential decision to  remove  them  to
    Pakistan.

 2. The respondents are Pakistani nationals.  They arrived in the UK on  20
    July 2012, the first respondent having leave  to  enter  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student valid to 30  April  2014,  her  husband,  the  second
    respondent, and their two children, the third  and  fourth  respondents
    respectively, having Entry Clearance as Tier  4  (General)  dependants,
    also valid until 30 April 2014. On 31 March 2014 they applied for leave
    to remain on the basis of their private life, relying on Article  8  of
    the ECHR.  No reference was made to fact that the second respondent was
    receiving treatment for cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C,  with  chronic
    liver disease.  In the letter of refusal, the appellant identified that
    the respondents did  not  meet  the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  or
    paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules and there were no exceptional
    circumstances warranting a consideration of their being  granted  leave
    to remain outside the Immigration Rules, it would not  be  unreasonable
    to expect the children to leave the UK.  Account  was  taken  of  their
    interests and the appellant was acting in accordance with section 55 of
    the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009; they would leave  as
    a family.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal found that it would be inhuman  to  return  the
    second respondent to Pakistan and that this was "one of those very rare
    cases where removal would breach the United Kingdom's obligations under
    Article 3 on medical grounds" [paragraph 24].  Further, in relation  to
    Article 8, it was found that as the second respondent  had  an  illness
    which will be terminal if there is no surgical intervention,  which  is
    in practical and financial terms was not available to him in  Pakistan,
    these were both exceptional and compelling circumstances not recognised
    within the rules [Paragraph 26] and his removal would be  a  breach  of
    Article 8 [paragraph 38].  It followed that if he  was  to  remain,  it
    would  also  be  disproportionate  to  remove  the  other   respondents
    [paragraph 40]. It was stressed that had it not  been  for  the  second
    respondent's illness, this  conclusion  in  relation  to  a  breach  of
    Article 8 would not have been reached [paragraph 41].

 4. There are two grounds of  appeal.   The  first  is  one  of  procedural
    fairness, the Judge having expressed sympathy for the second respondent
    and disclosed that he suffered from the same condition.  Mr Kandola, on
    behalf of the appellant, did not pursue this ground.   The  second  was
    that the Judge  materially  misdirected  himself  in  relation  to  the
    finding  of  exceptional  circumstances  justifying  the  appeal  being
    allowed on Article 3 and 8 grounds.

 5. The relevant factual findings to be distilled  from  the  Determination
    are that

          a. The second respondent  suffers  from  advanced  chronic  liver
             disease due to hepatitis C cirrhosis;

          b. The seriousness of the  disease  and  the  need  for  a  liver
             transplant has been established;

          c. A liver transplant in Pakistan could cost 4.5  million  rupees
             (about  ï¿½24,500).   Because  of  his  financial  and  personal
             circumstances, treatment for his condition in  Pakistan  would
             be "prohibitively expensive".

 6. The law in relation to the application of Article 3  to  the  cases  of
    removal of those suffering from a serious medical condition  which  are
    being effectively treated in this country as established by the case of
    N v. Secretary of State [2005] 2 AC 296 [2005] UKHL 31 and the judgment
    in N v United Kingdom [2008] EHRR 39 was comprehensively considered and
    applied in  the  case  of  GS  (India),  EO  (Ghana),  GM  (India),  PL
    (Jamaica), BA (Ghana) & KK (DRC) [2015] EWCA Civ 40, in which  judgment
    was given on the day we heard this appeal.   In that case, five of  the
    six appellants were suffering from terminal renal failure or end  stage
    kidney disease (ESKD).  It is not necessary for the  purposes  of  this
    decision to refer at length to the case of N  (ante)  or  GS  &  others
    (ante).  Exceptionality, bringing a case within Article  3,  will  only
    apply where removal will not only inevitably lead to certain death  but
    also death in circumstances of inhuman and degrading conditions  -  see
    the judgments of Laws LJ  at  paragraphs  66-67  and  Underhill  LJ  at
    paragraphs 104-105.

 7. In relation to Article 8, GS & others (ante) makes clear  that  if  the
    Article 3 claim fails, a claim under Article 8 requires "some  separate
    or additional factual element within  the  Article  8  paradigm  -  the
    capacity to form and enjoy relationships - or a state of affairs having
    some  affinity  with  that  paradigm"  per  Laws  LJ  [paragraph   80].
    Underhill LJ [in paragraph 111] also referring to MM (Zimbabwe)  [2012]
    EWCA Civ 279 identified what he described as the two  essential  points
    that were being made in that case and represented the law -

         "first the absence or inadequacy of medical treatment,  even  life-
         preserving treatment, in the country or return, cannot be relied on
         at all as a factor engaging Article 8: if that is all there is, the
         claim must fail.  Secondly, where Article 8  is  engaged  by  other
         factors, the fact that the claimant is receiving medical  treatment
         in this country which may not be available in the country of return
         may be a factor in the proportionality exercise;  but  that  factor
         cannot be treated as by itself giving to a breach since that  would
         contravene the "no obligation to treat" principle".

 8. The First-tier tribunal made no reference to MM (Zimbabwe) (ante).  The
    Judge found that the "extreme seriousness" of the  second  respondent's
    condition and  "the  devastating  effect  on  his  moral  and  physical
    integrity of removing him to Pakistan" constrained him to conclude that
    his removal would breach Article 8.  He identified  that  as  the  sole
    reason for his conclusion.

 9. The findings that the removal of the second respondent would contravene
    Articles 3 and 8 were not conclusions to which the First-tier  Tribunal
    could come on the evidence.  This case did not come close to being  one
    of those exceptional cases where return would breach Article 3; in  any
    event, medical treatment was available in Pakistan,  it  was  financial
    constraints that were said to prevent treatment there.  Further,  there
    were no other  separate  or  additional  factual  elements  within  the
    Article 8 paradigm.

10. Accordingly, we find the Judge erred in law.  The appeal is allowed and
    we set the determination aside.

11. We consider this to be an appropriate  case  for  the  decision  to  be
    remade.  The case of  each  respondent  to  this  appeal  was  entirely
    dependant upon that of the second respondent.  For the reasons set out,
    there are no grounds for allowing the appeal by the  second  respondent
    of the appellant's decision of 20th May 2014.  Accordingly, the  appeal
    of each appellant in respect of that decision (the respondents in  this
    appeal) must be dismissed.

           The Honourable Mr Justice Goss    Date: 2 February 2015
