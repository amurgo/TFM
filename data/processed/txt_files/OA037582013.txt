Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Ahluwalia
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of  Pakistan  born  in  1984.   He  appealed
    against a decision of the  Respondent  made  on  14  November  2012  to
    dismiss his application for entry  clearance  as  the  partner  of  his
    spouse pursuant to Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 2. The Respondent refused the application under paragraph  E-  ECP.1.1  of
    the rules - E-ECP3.1.  The Appellant's Sponsor was employed on a salary
    of �16,645 a year.  He did not meet the financial  requirements.   Thus
    in order to meet the shortfall the  amount  of  �20,877.50  in  savings
    would be required.

 3. The Appellant sought to rely on savings held with Sun  Life,  MCB  Bank
    Pakistan and Halifax.  The Respondent contended that  the  MCB  account
    showed funds of about �2.75 which were held within the past six months.
     The Halifax showed funds of �848.41 as at April 2012.  No evidence  of
    savings with Sun Life had been produced.  The Appellant however  relied
    on a document  indicating  that  his  Sponsor  could  cash  in  a  life
    assurance policy of �16,289.  That did not meet the requirements to  be
    considered as 'cash savings'.

 4. He appealed.  Following a hearing at Hatton Cross on  8  November  2013
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Mailer dismissed the appeal under  the
    Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds (Article 8).

 5. In his findings he noted that it was accepted that the Appellant  could
    not meet the  relevant  financial  requirement  on  the  basis  of  the
    Sponsor's salary which was �16,645.  It was accepted that  she  had  to
    show savings of �20,877.  He noted that the Appellant relied on  a  Sun
    Life policy constituting a fifteen year savings plan with profits.   He
    found that at date of application paragraph 11A(a)  of  Appendix  FM-SE
    applied and that cash savings needed to be shown.  The  Appellant  'did
    not have savings in a bank account at the relevant date'.

 6. Moving to consider Article 8 ECHR, having found that there  was  family
    life he advanced to proportionality.  His conclusions are at [48 - 53].
     He found that the Sponsor is suffering from depression  following  the
    death of her father.  She spent several months  in  Pakistan  following
    his death but then returned to the UK where she has remained.  She does
    not wish to enjoy family life in Pakistan with her husband.  The  judge
    noted that she has been employed here.

 7. The judge also  noted  the  claim  that  the  Sponsor's  earnings  have
    increased.  He concluded that if such was so in any future  application
    the  Appellant  would  be  likely  to  meet  the   relevant   financial
    requirements on the basis of the Sponsor's salary.

 8. He found that at date of  decision  her  salary  of  �16,645  p.a.  was
    'substantially short of the minimum amount required'.

 9. Further, that the Sponsor had 'elected to retain  her  investment  with
    Sun Life.  She did  not  even  contemplate  transferring  the  paid  up
    proceeds into a cash savings account in her bank account'.

10. The judge also stated: 'It  is  not  asserted  that  it  would  not  be
    possible to achieve the minimum amount.  Accordingly, the  interference
    contemplated would be for a short period'.  No other reasons  had  been
    advanced by the Respondent as to why clearance could not be given  once
    the financial requirements had been satisfied.

11. The judge ended by  stating  that  he  had  regard  to  the  legitimate
    interest  sought  to  be  achieved  by  the  Respondent   namely,   the
    maintenance of a fair and consistent immigration policy.  There was 'no
    suggestion that the financial requirement is not  rationally  connected
    with the policy sought to be achieved'.

12. The Appellant sought permission to appeal which was granted by a  judge
    on
    7 January 2014.

13. At the error of law hearing before me Mr Ahluwalia directed me to MM  v
    SSHD [2013] EWHC  1900.   The  judge  had  erred  in  failing  to  make
    reference to that case.  In particular, first, the judge failed to have
    regard to the factors considered by  the  Administrative  Court  to  be
    relevant to the assessment of proportionality (MM [124]).  Second,  the
    Sponsor's earnings were more than �13,400.  Third, the Tribunal  failed
    to have regard to the fact that the  Sponsor  has  substantial  savings
    albeit not in the prescribed form.  Further,  the  Tribunal  failed  to
    have regard to the fact that at the date of  hearing  the  Sponsor  was
    earning over �19,000 a figure in excess of  the  sum  required  by  the
    rules to sponsor a spouse.  Such evidence, although  it  could  not  be
    considered in the context of the appeal under the rules,  was  relevant
    to the assessment  of  proportionality.   Fifth,  the  judge  erred  in
    finding that the Appellant could make a fresh application.  As  he  now
    satisfied the rule such made no sense.

14. Mr Ahluwalia did not seek to argue a second point in the grounds  (2.3)
    accepting that such had not been raised before the judge.

15. In reply Mr Melvin submitted that this was a straightforward case.  The
    judgment was sustainable.  It did not appear that MM was argued  before
    the judge.  It was not a material error for him not  to  take  it  into
    account in considering proportionality.

16. I do not consider that the judge made a material error of law.   First,
    while Mr Ahluwalia, who did not appear at first instance was unclear on
    the matter, Mr Melvin said there was no mention of MM in the Presenting
    Officer's minutes, nor is  there  mention  in  the  judge's  Record  of
    Proceedings.  I am satisfied that nothing in respect of that  case  was
    argued before the judge.  In the circumstances I do not see it to be an
    error of law for the judge not to have considered a case or submissions
    not raised before him.

17. The judge correctly concluded that  the  Appellant  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of the rules, as the Sponsor was  unable  to  provide  the
    necessary evidence of income. However, he went on to consider the  case
    outside the rules under article 8 ECHR. In  doing  so  he  ignored  the
    Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules -  correct  approach)  [2013]  UKUT  640
    (IAC) guidance more recently affirmed  in Shahzad  (Art  8:  legitimate
    aim) [2014] UKUT 00085  where the Upper Tribunal held that:

      i) Failure on the part of the Secretary of State to  identify  in  her
         decision any legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR does not
         prevent a court or tribunal from seeking to do so on the  basis  of
         the materials before it.

     ii) "Maintenance of effective immigration control" whilst not as such a
         legitimate aim under Article 8(2)  of  the  ECHR  can  normally  be
         assumed to be either an aspect of "prevention of disorder or crime"
         or an aspect of "economic well being of the country" or both.

    iii) "Prevention of disorder or crime" is normally a legitimate aim both
         in expulsion cases where there has been  criminal  conduct  on  the
         part of the claimant and in expulsion cases where there  have  only
         been breaches of immigration law.

     iv) MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 held  that  the  new  immigration
         rules regarding deportation of a foreign criminal  are  a  complete
         code. This was because  of  the  express  requirement  in  them  at
         paragraph 398 to have regard to exceptional circumstances and other
         factors.

      v) It follows from this that  any  other  rule  which  has  a  similar
         provision will also constitute a complete code.

     vi) Where an area of the rules does not have such an express mechanism,
         the approach in (R) Nagre v SSHD [2013] EWHC  and Gulshan should be
         followed: ie after applying the requirements of the rules, only  if
         there may be arguably good grounds for  granting  leave  to  remain
         outside them is it necessary to go on to consider whether there are
         compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them.

18.  In this case the First tier Tribunal  judge  failed  to  identify  the
    compelling circumstances not adequately  recognised  in  the  rules  to
    justify considering the application outside the rules on the  basis  of
    article 8 ECHR,  but  simply  went  on  to  address  Article  8  issues
    following the Razgar v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27 steps. Such was an error  of
    law. However, it was not material because for the reasons given by  the
    judge it could not be said that the circumstances of the Appellant  and
    Sponsor were compelling or the outcome unjustifiably harsh.

19. In this case in  the  Article  8  proportionality  exercise  the  judge
    appeared to find that  because she  has  work  here  and  is  depressed
    following the death of her father it would be  unreasonable  to  expect
    the Sponsor to go to Pakistan to develop their family life.

20. However, the judge then considered the Sponsor's income   Although  the
    Sponsor's earnings at date of decision were above �13,400 the judge was
    entitled to find that they were 'substantially  short  of  the  minimum
    amount required'.

21. He took heed of the fact that the Sponsor  has  savings,  the  bulk  of
    which is a Sun Life policy.  He was correct to find that such  did  not
    constitute funds held in a relevant bank or savings account as required
    by  the  rules.   He  was  entitled  to  take  into  account   in   the
    proportionality exercise that she had not contemplated transferring the
    paid up proceeds into a bank  account  the  reason,  according  to  her
    evidence, being that she did not want to surrender  a  15  year  policy
    after only 7 years.

22. There is a route for entry as  the  spouse  of  a  person  present  and
    settled in the UK. It is a route that remains open to the Appellant. In
    respect of that route the claim is that they meet  and  can  now  prove
    that they meet the financial maintenance threshold,  even  though  they
    could not do so at the date of application. The judge had no discretion
    to  allow  the  appeal  on  the  basis  that  they  'almost'  met   the
    requirements. The rules are clear and  must  have  been  known  to  the
    parties before deciding that they wanted to live together  in  the  UK.
    They are not entitled to settle in the UK simply because that is  their
    choice.  They must meet with adequate evidence the requirements of  the
    rules and they must be taken to have known these requirements from  the
    outset of their relationship.

23. I do not see merit in Mr Ahluwalia's submission that at date of hearing
    the Sponsor was earning around �19,000 and that such  was  relevant  to
    the assessment of proportionality. The  relevant  date  in  considering
    Article 8 ECHR is date of decision. If it is their case that they would
    now  be  able  to  meet  all  the  requirements   it  can   hardly   be
    disproportionate to provide a route for entry and require the Appellant
    to meet  like all other applicants the rules for proving the  Sponsor's
    finances. The judge was entitled to find that  were  the  finances  now
    sufficient to satisfy the rules (and such  remains  to  be  seen)   any
    interference with the right to respect for family life would, pending a
    further application, be for a short period.

24. The issue in this case is not whether  a  different  judge  might  have
    reached a different decision on the  facts  presented.   Rather  it  is
    whether the First-tier Tribunal decision was  vitiated  by  a  material
    error of law.

25. I consider, looking at the judge's analysis  in  the  round,  that  his
    decision on proportionality was one he was entitled  to  reach  on  the
    evidence before him for the reasons he gave. It cannot be said that  no
    reasonable judge could reach that conclusion or that the  decision  was
    erroneous in law.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not involve  the  making  of  a
material error of law and the  decision  dismissing  the  appeal  under  the
Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds  stands.
