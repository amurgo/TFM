                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellants appeal against a decision of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Manchester promulgated on 3rd September 2014.

 2. The Appellants are citizens  of  Pakistan  and  the  first  and  second
    Appellants are married.  They are the parents of the third, fourth  and
    fifth Appellants.

 3. On 26th December 2013 the first Appellant applied for leave  to  remain
    in the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant  under  the
    Points-Based System (PBS).  The remaining Appellants made  applications
    for leave to remain as dependants of the first Appellant.

 4. The applications were refused on 6th May 2014.  The  first  Appellant's
    application was refused with reference to  paragraph  245ZX(c)  because
    she had not been awarded 30 points in relation to her  Confirmation  of
    Acceptance for Studies (CAS).  This  was  because  the  CAS  which  was
    submitted by the first Appellant was  apparently  submitted  after  her
    application, and indicated that her course was due to start on 5th  May
    2014.  For a CAS to be valid, the course for which it was  issued  must
    start within three months of the date of application, and as the course
    was not due to start until 5h May 2014, the first Appellant  failed  to
    meet the requirements of paragraph 116(b) of Appendix A and was not  in
    possession of a valid CAS.

 5. In addition the first Appellant had not provided evidence to show  that
    she had passed one of  the  approved  English  Language  tests  to  the
    standard of a minimum of CEFR level B2 and therefore  did  not  satisfy
    the requirements of paragraph 118(b) of Appendix A.

 6. The application was also refused with reference to  paragraph  245ZX(d)
    as the first Appellant had not been awarded 10 points  for  Maintenance
    (funds).  This  was  because  the  first  Appellant  did  not  have  an
    established presence in the United Kingdom as a student  and  therefore
    she needed to prove that she was in possession of �23,400  in  relation
    to herself and her dependants, for a consecutive 28 day period to  meet
    the Maintenance requirements.  The bank statement  submitted  with  the
    application with account number 635 was not  accepted  as  satisfactory
    evidence, as  it  only  showed  evidence  of  �23,278.50  between  13th
    December 2013 and 26th December 2013, and therefore did not  cover  the
    required consecutive 28 day period, nor did it  prove  that  the  first
    Appellant held the required level of funds.

 7. The applications of the remaining Appellants were refused in line  with
    that of the first Appellant.

 8. The  appeals  were  decided  on  the  papers  at  the  request  of  the
    Appellants.   Judge  Manchester  (the  judge)  found  that  the   first
    Appellant could not satisfy the Maintenance requirements  of  paragraph
    245ZX(d) and therefore the appeal could not succeed  under  the  Rules.
    The judge did not go on to consider the issues in relation to the first
    Appellant's CAS.  The judge found that the  appeals  of  the  remaining
    Appellants could not succeed under the Rules in line with  his  finding
    in relation to the first Appellant.

 9.  The  judge  went  on  to  consider  Article  8,  and  found  that  the
    Respondent's decisions did not breach Article 8, and the  appeals  were
    dismissed on human rights grounds.

10. The Appellants applied for permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal.
    In summary it was contended that the judge  had  erred  by  not  making
    findings in relation to the first Appellant's CAS, having  decided  the
    Maintenance issue.  The judge had also erred by  not  considering  that
    the Respondent had failed to comply with the common  law  duty  to  act
    fairly.  Revocation of the Sponsor's licence for the college where  the
    first Appellant had last been studying, meant  that  she  had  to  meet
    different requirements, such as an enhanced level of  Maintenance,  and
    the first Appellant had to apply for another English language test.  In
    any event the additional requirements were met before the date  of  the
    Respondent's decision.

11. The first Appellant had been unable to  obtain  a  CAS  until  she  had
    undertaken an English language test.  She had arranged to take  a  test
    with TOEIC, but that organisation was  removed  from  the  Respondent's
    approved list, and she was initially unable to undertake an IELTS  test
    because her passport was with the Respondent.

12. The first Appellant had moved address and had notified her  college  of
    this, but did not receive the Respondent's  letter  dated  3rd  October
    2013 curtailing her leave until 18th December 2013.

13. It was contended that the  Respondent  had  not  properly  applied  the
    evidential flexibility policy by failing to notify the first  Appellant
    in relation to missing documents.

14. It was also contended that in relation to Maintenance, in December 2013
    the rates of Pakistani currency were fluctuating and the exchange  rate
    at the time was not the correct exchange rate.

15. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Gibb on 24th September 2014.

16. Following the grant of permission  the  Respondent  lodged  a  response
    pursuant to Rule 24 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 contending that the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  disclosed  no
    error of law.  It was submitted that  the  first  Appellant's  previous
    leave had been varied to expire in 60 days' time in accordance with the
    Respondent's policy, following revocation of the college  licence.   It
    was submitted that there was no procedural unfairness in this case, and
    the first Appellant  had  been  unable  to  meet  the  Rules.   It  was
    submitted that in any event the first Appellant's CAS would not be able
    to satisfy  the  relevant  Rules  and  appendixes,  and  therefore  the
    application was always doomed to fail.

17. Directions were issued making provision  for  there  to  be  a  hearing
    before the Upper Tribunal to decide  whether  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    determination should be set aside.



The Upper Tribunal Hearing

18. The first Appellant attended.  She confirmed she was content to proceed
    without legal representation.  She also confirmed  that  there  was  no
    need for an interpreter and proceedings could be conducted in  English.
    I explained the procedure that would be adopted,  and  that  I  had  to
    decide whether the First-tier Tribunal had made an error of  law.   The
    first Appellant confirmed that she had seen the  Respondent's  Rule  24
    response and she understood the issues that had to be considered.

19. Before commencing submissions, the first Appellant agreed that I should
    ask some questions in an effort to clarify issues.

20. The first Appellant confirmed that her application for leave to  remain
    was to enable her to study  at  Birmingham  Informatics  College.   She
    accepted that she did not submit a CAS with her application  for  leave
    to remain, because this could not be obtained as she  did  not  have  a
    valid English language certificate, as her last certificate expired  on
    15th December 2013.

21. The first Appellant accepted that the bank statement she relied upon in
    her application had the  account  number  635,  and  covered  a  period
    between 13th December 2013 and 11th January 2014.

22. The first Appellant produced a copy of the  Respondent's  letter  dated
    3rd October 2013 curtailing  her  leave  so  that  it  expired  on  2nd
    December 2013 rather than 2nd January 2014.  This letter confirmed that
    on 13th May  2013  the  Sponsor  licence  for  Birmingham  Professional
    College was revoked.  The first  Appellant  said  that  she  had  moved
    address and informed her college, and did not receive this letter until
    18th December 2013.

23. In providing some background information  the  first  Appellant  stated
    that when she arrived in the United Kingdom she studied  at  Birmingham
    College of Information & Technology, but she was dissatisfied with  the
    standard of teaching and left that college in  April  2012.   She  then
    enrolled at Birmingham  Professional  College  in  September  2012  and
    commenced her studies in January 2013.  She had a problem in  that  her
    visa extension was refused, and she successfully appealed against  this
    and I received a copy of a determination promulgated  on  21st  January
    2013 confirming that the first Appellant's appeal had been successful.

24. The first Appellant stated that she did not discover that  the  Sponsor
    licence for Birmingham Professional College had been revoked until 15th
    November 2013.  She then started looking for a new college.  She  found
    a new college, but did not have enough time to  obtain  a  new  English
    language certificate and therefore could not  submit  a  CAS  with  her
    application for leave to remain on 26th December 2013.

25. In submitting that the Respondent had erred in law, the first Appellant
    relied upon the written submissions contained  within  the  application
    for permission to appeal, which have been summarised  earlier  in  this
    decision.

26. I then heard submissions from Mr Smart who  relied  upon  the  Rule  24
    response.  I was asked to note that revocation of the  Sponsor  licence
    for Birmingham Professional College took place on 13th May  2013.   The
    First-tier Tribunal had addressed the issue of fairness and taken  into
    account that the application made by the Appellant for further leave to
    remain, would have had to have been made in any event by the Appellant,
    even if her leave had not been curtailed, before 2nd January  2014.   I
    was asked to find that the judge  had  not  erred  in  considering  the
    Immigration Rules, and had not erred in  considering  the  question  of
    fairness, nor evidential flexibility, and Mr Smart contended  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal should stand.

27. At the conclusion of submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

28. I do not find that the judge materially erred in law for the  following
    reasons.

29. The Judge dismissed the appeals because the  First  Appellant  had  not
    proved that she satisfied the provisions of paragraph 245ZX(d).   I  do
    not find an error in that conclusion.

30. The first Appellant did not have an established presence as a  student.
    The judge considered this in paragraph 35 of  his  decision,  and  took
    into account the provisions of paragraph 14 of Appendix C.  In my  view
    the judge was correct to make this finding, as the first Appellant  had
    not proved that she had finished a single course that was at least  six
    months' long within her last period of leave to remain, and she was not
    applying for continued study on a single course where she had completed
    at least six months of that course, neither was she applying for  leave
    to remain as a Tier 4 (General)  Student  on  the  doctorate  extension
    scheme.  Therefore the  judge  was  correct  to  find  that  the  first
    Appellant needed to show  that  she  had  total  funds  of  �23,400  in
    relation to herself and her four dependants.

31. The judge found that the Appellant needed to show that this amount  was
    available at the date of application  and  for  a  consecutive  28  day
    period of time.  My view is that paragraph 1A(c) of Appendix  C  states
    that an applicant must have the funds for a consecutive 28  day  period
    of time, and (h) states that the end date of the 28 day period  is  the
    date of the closing  balance  on  the  most  recent  of  the  specified
    documents submitted, and this must be no earlier than  31  days  before
    the date of application.  In this case it would appear  that  the  bank
    statement with account number 635 submitted by the Appellant, could not
    have been submitted with the application for leave to remain which  was
    submitted on 26th December 2013, because it  covers  a  period  between
    13th December 2013 and 11th January 2014 and would therefore appear  to
    be  inadmissible  under  the  provisions  of  Section  85A(4)  of   the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act).   However,
    even if the bank statement was admissible, the  judge  was  correct  to
    find that it did not satisfy the requirements of the Immigration Rules,
    because the amount contained therein was less  than  �23,400,  and  the
    bank statement did not cover the 28 day period referred to in paragraph
    1A(h) of Appendix C.

32. Therefore the judge was correct to find that the burden  of  proof  had
    not been discharged in relation to paragraph 245ZX(d).  The  appeal  of
    the first Appellant therefore had to be dismissed under the Immigration
    Rules, as did the appeals of the remaining Appellants.

33. In my view the judge should have gone on to make findings  in  relation
    to the other reasons for refusal, as these  were  referred  to  in  the
    Grounds of Appeal, and Section 86(2) of  the  2002  Act,  requires  the
    Tribunal to determine any matter raised as a Ground of Appeal.  It  was
    not however a material error not to have made findings in  relation  to
    the other reasons for refusal.  This was because the appeal  could  not
    in any event succeed  because  of  the  failure  to  satisfy  paragraph
    245ZX(d).

34. If the judge had considered the other reasons for refusal, in  my  view
    the appeals would have been dismissed on those grounds also.  The first
    Appellant accepts that she did not submit with her application a  valid
    CAS, nor did she submit a valid English language test certificate  from
    an approved provider.  Therefore the requirements of paragraph 245ZX(c)
    could not be satisfied in relation to the first Appellant.

35. The judge considered the issue of fairness and took  into  account  all
    that the first Appellant submitted on this issue, in her letters  dated
    28th April 2014 and 10th July 2014, and these letters are  referred  to
    in paragraphs 32 and 34 of the First-tier Tribunal decision.  The judge
    in paragraph 42 considered the revocation of  the  Sponsor  licence  of
    Birmingham Professional College and noted that even if that licence had
    not been revoked, the first Appellant's leave was due to expire on  2nd
    January 2014, and therefore she would have needed  to  make  a  further
    application for leave to remain in  any  event.   The  first  Appellant
    contended that she would not have needed to have provided  an  enhanced
    level of Maintenance nor would she have needed  to  provide  a  further
    English language certificate. However I find this  speculative  on  the
    first Appellant's part, in that the Sponsor licence was revoked as long
    ago as 13th May 2013, and the judge was entitled to consider the  first
    Appellant would not have an  established  presence  as  a  student  and
    therefore she would have needed to show she had available  the  sum  of
    �24,300, and she would have needed to supply  a  new  English  language
    test certificate if she made her application for leave to remain  after
    15th December 2013 when her previous certificate expired.

36. The judge did not err in considering eventual flexibility,  finding  in
    paragraph 43 of his decision  there  was  no  evidence  that  the  bank
    statement was one of a series which was missing, and it  could  not  be
    said that the Respondent should have anticipated  that  addressing  any
    omission would lead to a grant of leave, and  it  is  clear  the  first
    Appellant's application was submitted without a valid  CAS,  without  a
    valid English language test certificate, and with a bank statement that
    did not show that the required funds were held in the account, for  the
    required period.

37. For the reasons give above I do not find that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision discloses a material error of law.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.  The appeals are dismissed.

No order for anonymity was made by the First-tier Tribunal.  There has  been
no  request  for  anonymity  and  the  Upper  Tribunal  makes  no  anonymity
direction.
