Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Nadeem, Counsel, instructed by Immigration Advice
Service , Birmingham
For the Respondent:    Mr Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant applied for leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  as  a
    Tier 1 (General) Migrant.  His application was refused on 4 July  2013.
    He sought to appeal against that decision,  which  appeal  came  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Thomas on 3 December 2013.

2.   In order to obtain the requisite  number  of  points  it  was  for  the
    appellant to show that his  earnings  for  the  previous  twelve  month
    period had reached �50,000.  In the event upon the documentation  which
    was presented upon application that figure was �41,765.04.

3.   In respect of the other matters the appropriate number  of  points  was
    awarded.

4.   The appellant gave evidence at the hearing which is  set  out  in  some
    detail at paragraphs 4 and 5 of the determination.  The income that was
    declared in his application was based upon an interim  account  by  his
    accountant and he had by mistake not provided all the documents to  his
    accountants.

5.   At the hearing the appellant produced a bundle of documents  being  his
    bank statement and a revised letter from  the  accountant  and  revised
    financial accounts for the period 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013.

6.   Had those documents been submitted to his accountants at  the  relevant
    time then they would have shown figures above �50,000.

7.   Unfortunately the appellant had not produced those documents  with  the
    application and indeed had only discovered the omission  upon  refusal.
    Therefore it  was  not  possible  for  the  Judge  to  accept  the  new
    documentation under Section 19 of the UK Borders Act  2007.   Thus  the
    appellant  failed  in  establishing  any  successful  claim  upon   the
    Immigration  Rules,  although  as  the  Judge  noted  specifically   at
    paragraph 7, there was  nothing  which  prevented  the  appellant  from
    making a further application.

8.   The grounds of appeal which were lodged  in  relation  to  that  matter
    contend that the  respondent  was  in  breach  of  her  own  evidential
    flexibility policy.  It is not entirely clear in what way that could be
    said.  The grounds set out in some detail the nature of the policy  but
    it is difficult to understand what more could  have been  done  by  the
    respondent upon receipt of the financial documents.  They did not  show
    that which they should have shown, and that  was  an  omission  by  the
    appellant and not by the respondent.

9.   Grounds of appeal, however, were submitted on  another  matter,  namely
    that no findings were made as to Article 8 of the ECHR.   It  was  upon
    that basis that leave to appeal  was  granted  and  brings  the  appeal
    before me.

10.  I raised with Mr Nadeem, who represents the appellant the issue of  the
    flexibility policy and what it was that the respondent  ought  to  have
    done having received the paper  work  from  the  appellant.  There  was
    nothing  missing  from  the  paperwork.   There  were   no   sequential
    difficulties but merely the fact that the  evidence  produced  did  not
    achieve the result intended.  Mr Nadeem most fairly indicated  that  he
    was in difficulties in articulating what it  was  that  the  respondent
    should have done.

11.  I bear in mind also that insofar as the evidential  flexibility  policy
    is concerned, the original decision in Rodriguez was revisited  by  the
    Court of Appeal in  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  v
    Rodriguez [2014]  EWCA  Civ  2.   The  policy  was  found  to  be  more
    restrictive in its operation than had previously been  considered.  The
    court held at paragraph  110  of  the  Judgement  that  the  evidential
    flexibility policy did not require the Secretary of State in every case
    where there was a failure to meet the requirements of  the  Immigration
    Rules to make furtherer enquiries.  In that case it was held  that  the
    Upper Tribunal Judge was right to conclude that the Secretary of  State
    was under no obligation to enquire as to the presence of further funds.



12.  I see little merit  in  the  grounds  of  appeal  in  relation  to  the
    immigration decision made by the judge, namely to dismiss the appeal in
    that respect.

13.  The issue of Article 8, however, is of greater concern  because  it  is
    undoubtedly clear that in the decision of 4 July 2013, the decision  is
    made to remove the appellant by way of directions under Section  47  of
    the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

14.  Notwithstanding that clear statement, there appears in paragraph  7  of
    the determination the statement "there are no removal directions and no
    issue of human rights raised.   There  is  nothing  that  prevents  the
    appellant from making a further application".

15.  It is far from clear as to how that statement came to be  made  and  it
    was certainly incorrect to say that there were no  removal  directions.



16.  Mr Nadeem was not the representative on the  occasion  but  he  recalls
    speaking to the representative who was, who recalls the issue of  there
    being no removal directions being raised and hence no  argument  as  to
    human rights.

17.  Mr Mills has a slightly different perspective to  take  on  the  matter
    and produces to me the note from the Home Office Presenting Officer  at
    the hearing, from which it is noted that the Judge  accepted  that  the
    grounds had not raised Article 8 and thus no  submissions  relating  to
    Article 8 was required from the Home Office Presenting Officer.

18.  My attention was drawn by Mr Mills to the original  grounds  of  appeal
    against the decision, and it is certainly  correct  that  there  is  no
    overt ground of appeal relating to human rights.

19.  Nevertheless it is a matter of concern  that  what  appears  to  be  an
    incorrect statement of fact appears in the determination.   I  consider
    the notes of procedures which are not entirely easy to  read.   I  note
    the observation:-

         "No human rights raised.  No removal directions."

20.  Thereafter appears a phrase which seems  to  read  that  there  are  no
    removal directions and nothing to prevent the  appellant  from  raising
    that further under 3C leave.  That leave applies to him and so no human
    rights to consider.

21.  Mr Mills asked me to consider that there was no error  of  law  in  the
    approach taken by the Judge.  No human rights issues were raised in the
    grounds of appeal.  There is no statement or skeleton argument in which
    they were raised at the hearing.  I asked Mr Nadeem whether in all  the
    bundle of documents there were any statements from the appellant as  to
    his personal situation and circumstances and I was told that there were
    none at present.

22.  I find from the Record of Proceedings that clearly the issue  of  there
    being no removal directions was raised at some point  in  the  hearing.
    Clearly, to so record was an error.

23.  An essential issue in this appeal, however, is whether  that  error  is
    material to the outcome of the appeal.  In the absence of any  evidence
    presented as to the private and family life  of  the  appellant  it  is
    difficult, without more, to conclude that there was any safe basis  for
    the conclusion that human rights were engaged.

24.  The appellant had  finished  his  studies  and  so  the  CDS  point  of
    interruption of studies did not arise.  He was now seeking to operate a
    business in the United Kingdom but had  not  satisfied  the  respondent
    that he met the requirements to do so.  That would seem to be very much
    a different matter from a break in a lengthy period of studies.

25.  Since he failed to meet the Immigration Rules the jurisprudence as  set
    out in the recent decisions of Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct
    approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) and  Shahzad  (Article  8:  ....   of
    name) [2014] UKUT 0085 (IAC) would come into play,  namely  that  there
    would have to be something compelling in the applicant's  circumstances
    in order to call in the question of Article 8 of the ECHR.  Nothing had
    been  advanced and nothing particularly is obvious.

26.  Clearly were it not for the Section  19  barrier  the  appellant  would
    have been able to satisfy the Rules upon  the  production  of  his  new
    accounts.  Again as has been  made clear by the Supreme Court in Nazeem
    and Others (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 25 (IAC) Article 8 is not to be used
    to circumvent technical difficulties under the Rules.

27.  As Mr Mills submitted, even were the matter to  get  to  the  issue  of
    proportionality,  the   argument  would  be  bound  to  fail  in   this
    particular case by reason of the paucity of evidence as to  private  or
    family life.

28.  He set out what is  his  understanding  of  the  current  situation  on
    applications which fail because new  evidence   was  prevented  by  the
    operation of Section 19.

29.  He submitted that in case, as indeed had been highlighted by the  Judge
    in the determination, the course open to the appellant was a relatively
    straightforward one: that was to make a new application.

30.  It was accepted by the Secretary of State that  in  the  light  of  the
    fairly draconian effects which Section  19  had  upon  the  ability  of
    individuals to present evidence, even evidence seeking to clarify  that
    which was presented before, Section 3C  leave  operates  and  indeed  a
    period of 28 days thereafter is allowed for an appellant to  present  a
    new application in-country.

31.  The point of Section 19 was to  stop  the  proliferation  of  documents
    being presented except on time.   That  did  not  prevent  however  the
    making of a fresh application upon proper documentation.

32.  He submitted that that is what the appellant could   reasonably  do  in
    this case.  It was not a situation in reality that he would be  removed
    from the jurisdiction, rather that he had  the  opportunity  should  he
    take it to make a fresh application.  If he chooses not to do so it  is
    difficult therefore to argue that his human rights are infringed as  he
    has the choice to make that application or not, as the case may be.  Mr
    Nadeem seemingly accepted the logic of the position as outlined  by  Mr
    Mills and  indicated  that  that  too  was  his  understanding  of  the
    situation.

33.   It  seems  to  me,  therefore,  somewhat  unfortunate  that  this  new
    application could not have been  made many months ago  when  the  error
    was first noted.  That would have saved the time  and  expense  of  two
    hearings.   The  appellant  cannot  be  heard  to  argue  that  it   is
    disproportionate to remove him if he does nothing to  take  what  would
    seem an obvious step to take in the process.  It is accepted that  that
    may involve the payment of another fee but it was his  mistake  in  the
    first place that went to the difficulty.

34.  Looking at the matter overall therefore in relation to  the  ground  of
    appeal as to human rights, although  I  find  there  was  an  error  in
    stating that it was not part of the decision,  had it been   considered
    it is inevitable that the claim would have been dismissed.   The remedy
    of the appellant is a simple and straightforward one, namely to make  a
    new  application  with  the  correct  documents  covering  the  correct
    financial period.

35.  In all the circumstances, therefore, this appeal of  the  appellant  to
    the Upper Tribunal  is  dismissed.   The  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge  shall  therefore  stand,  namely  that  the  appeal  is
    dismissed under the Immigration Rules and dismissed under Article 8  of
    the ECHR.
