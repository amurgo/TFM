Solicitors
For the respondent:      Mr A Tan, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1.   The appellant is a national of Pakistan, born on 21 May 1983. On 23
      June 2016 he applied for entry clearance to be with his wife, Mrs
      Shabina Ali Akhtar, hereinafter referred to as his sponsor. She was
      born on 19 January 1970. Her family came here when she was a child and
      she holds British nationality. She is employed as a solicitor. She was
      married before and has an adult son. The appellant is her maternal
      first cousin.


   2. His application was refused on 5 October 2016. It was considered under
      appendix FM.The respondent concluded he had not demonstrated the
      marriage was genuine and subsisting. The claim was he met his sponsor
      in December 2013 and they married in October 2014. He had submitted
      photographs which were mainly of his wedding and a limited number of
      `WhatsAP' printouts. The respondent expected greater evidence to have
      been produced of demonstrate regular contact, emotional support and an
      abiding interest. It is for the appellant to demonstrate he meets the
      immigration rules.

   3. A further point taken related to accommodation. The appellant had
      indicated he would live with his sponsor at [                        ]
      which he said his wife owned. However, the Land Registry certificate
      and the mortgage statements indicate that the property is in joint
      names, his sponsor and a Mr Amran Ali, who she says is her brother.
      There was no written consent from him to the appellant moving into the
      property.

The First-tier Tribunal.

   4. The appeal was heard on 30 January 2018 before First-tier Tribunal
      Judge Moxon. In a decision promulgated on 6 February 2018 it was
      dismissed.


   5. The account was that the appellant had been living with his parents
      and siblings and in 2013 his father died. His father is the brother of
      his sponsor's mother. She stated that on the death of his father she
      contacted him in 2013 to express her condolences. They maintained
      contact to the point where they decided to marry. His sponsor
      travelled to Pakistan in October 2014 where she remained for several
      weeks, living with her husband and his then widowed mother and sister.
      His sponsor said that at the outset the relationship with his family
      were good but quickly deteriorated because they were suggesting she
      had not provided the dowry and gifts expected. The sponsor also
      expressed difficulties adjusting to life in the appellant's family's
      home where his mother was the head of the household and she was
      expected to comply with her wishes and carry out domestic duties. The
      sponsor returned again to Pakistan in December 2014 for several weeks
      but again found the relationship with her in-laws difficult. She had
      not seen the appellant in person since.


   6. The sponsor told First-tier Tribunal Judge Moxon that the property she
      lives in is in reality her own. She is the only one living there and
      she pays the mortgage and the outgoings. She said that the property
      was placed in joint names with her brother in case the sponsor became
      involved with someone who would make a claim on the property. It was
      said that the reason behind this was so that property would go to the
      sponsor's son from her first marriage.

   7. First-tier Tribunal Judge Moxon was influenced by the fact that the
      appellant and his sponsor had not seen each other for three years. The
      judge felt that if the relationship were genuine the sponsor would
      have put up with his in-laws behaviour. Alternatively, they could have
      met in another part of Pakistan or in a third country. The judge noted
      the application was not made until 18 months after the marriage.
      Additional evidence of contact had been provided and the judge
      questioned why this had not been provided with the application.

   8. Regarding the property the judge referred to the lack of corroborative
      evidence about the arrangement from her brother.

   9. The judge acknowledged that the sponsor was an officer of the court
      accepted that this enhanced her general credibility. However this did
      not outweigh the delay in the application and the separation of the
      parties in the last three years.

The Upper Tribunal

  10. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted on a renewed
      application by Upper Tribunal Judge Lindsley. The application is set
      out and the judge found the grounds arguable.


  11. The grounds are lengthy but emphasise the fact that the sponsor is a
      solicitor and her evidence should be given particular weight. It was
      also contended the judge erred in drawing inferences from the lack of
      direct contact between the parties for several years. It was argued
      that the judge failed to attach appropriate weight to the evidence of
      indirect contact provided. On the question of accommodation the
      sponsor had given an explanation in relation to her brother's interest
      and it was suggested the judge erred in rejecting this.

  12. At hearing, Mrs HS Randera relied upon the grounds advanced in the
      permission application. She submitted that the lack of direct contact
      between the parties was not determinative. She also emphasised the
      sponsor's standing as a solicitor. She said that this was not an
      arranged marriage. She referred to the evidence of money transfers and
      so forth. Regarding accommodation, the sponsor lived in the property
      alone. I was advised she could not obtain information about her
      brother because her family were not supportive.

  13. Mr Tan in response said that the judge was entitled to attach weight
      to the delay between the marriage and the application and the limited
      direct contact after. The evidence of communications provided was only
      subsequent to the application and it was as a matter for the judge to
      decide what weight should be attached to the evidence.

Consideration

  14. I find no material error of law established in the decision of First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Moxon. There were two issues to determine. The
      first was whether the marriage was genuine and subsisting and the
      second related to accommodation.


  15. There is no principle in law that a solicitor's evidence or that of
      any other professional should be given more weight than any other
      individual. Rather generously the judge in fact did acknowledge the
      sponsor's standing enhanced the weight of her evidence.

  16. The judge took into account legitimate considerations in assessing the
      relationship. Firstly there was a delay in making the application.
      Thereafter they were two visits, the last in which was in December
      2014. It was legitimate for the judge to ponder why, if this were a
      genuine relationship, there had not been more visits. The sponsor
      indicated she was earning over ï¿½40,000 at the time. Consequently,
      finance should not have been an issue. The judge considered whether
      for the sake of her relationship with the appellant she would have
      tolerated his family. The judge also suggested they could have met in
      another part of Pakistan or in a third country. These are sensible
      observations and I fail to see how a suggestion of cultural issues
      take away from the points made.


  17. Regarding the accommodation arrangement, the judge correctly noted
      that the sponsor's brother had an interest in the property and there
      was no evidence as to his consent. Mrs HS Randera advised me that
      there was no evidence from him because her family were not supportive.
      This disharmony was not disclosed at the First-tier Tribunal. It is
      all the more reason for questioning the availability of accommodation.
      The judge had described the appellant's explanation as to why her
      brother's name appeared on the title deeds as being confusing.
      Whatever the reason, his interest in the property is such that his
      consent would be required. This was not forthcoming.

  18. In summary I can find no material error of law in the decision of the
      judge. The judge carefully analysed the evidence and made logical
      conclusions. There is not necessary for the judge to specifically say
      the sponsor was not credible as this can be inferred from the outcome.


Decision
 No material error of law has been demonstrated in the decision of First-
tier Tribunal Judge Moxon. Consequently, that decision dismissing the
appeal shall stand.
