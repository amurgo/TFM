                         (ANONYMITY ORDER NOT MADE)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The appellant applied for  an  EEA  residence  card  as  the  durable
       partner of an EEA  national.  The  application  was  refused  on  6th
       November 2017, and the  First-tier  Tribunal  declined  to  hear  the
       appeal on the basis it did not have jurisdiction.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that  it  was  arguable
       that the First-tier judge had  erred  in  law  in  light  of  Khan  v
       Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755.  The
       parties were informed in that decision, dated 6th November 2018, that
       the Upper Tribunal was minded to find an error of law and  remit  the
       matter back to the First-tier Tribunal for remaking. The parties were
       given 7 days to make any  representations  opposing  this  course  of
       action if they so wished. No representations have  been  received.  I
       therefore find that there was an error of law on this basis and remit
       the matter to the First-tier Tribunal.

    Decision:

      1. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved  the
         making of an error on a point of law.

      2. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal that  they  had
         no jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

      3. I remit the remaking to the First-tier Tribunal.
