Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms U Miszkiel, Counsel (instructed by Jein
Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The Appellants in  these  linked  cases  appealed  with  permission
         granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Kelly  on  29  December  2014
         against the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Vincent  Fox
         who had dismissed the Appellants' appeals against the Secretary  of
         State's  decision  dated  17  February  2014  in  a   determination
         promulgated on 10 November 2014.  The Appellants are  nationals  of
         Sri Lanka, who had applied for further leave to remain in Tier 1 as
         a team of Entrepreneur Migrants  and  as  a  dependant.   This  was
         refused on general grounds and removal directions were  made  under
         section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

      2. Judge Kelly considered it arguable that Judge Fox should  not  have
         refused to adjourn the hearings in the  face  of  medical  evidence
         that the First Appellant was unfit to attend the hearing.   It  was
         arguable that the First Appellant might  have  been  able  to  give
         relevant evidence and that  the  tribunal  had  acted  unfairly  in
         refusing the adjournment.

      3. The Respondent opposed the onwards appeal, by notice under rule  24
         in the form of a letter to the Upper Tribunal dated 8 January 2015.

      4. Ms Miszkiel for the Appellants relied on the  onwards  grounds  and
         the  grant  of  permission  to  appeal.    Ms  Miszkiel   made   an
         application that I should recuse myself and adjourn the hearing  to
         another judge, on the grounds of potential perceived  bias.   Judge
         Fox at [15]  of  his  determination  had  referred  to  an  earlier
         interlocutory decision  of  mine  to  refuse  an  adjournment.   Ms
         Miszkiel's application was not supported by Mr Whitwell.  I refused
         the application because the appeal was against the refusal of Judge
         Fox to adjourn the hearing before him on 25 September 2014, on  the
         basis of a renewed application which was not my decision; see  [13]
         of the determination.  The decision to proceed was  his  alone.   I
         had expressed no view of the merits of the appeals at any stage and
         none was attributed to me.  No reasonable observer  would  perceive
         potential for bias in that situation.

      5. Ms Miszkiel went on to submit that the judge had erred  in  law  by
         accepting into evidence material provided by the  Appellants  which
         was  inadmissible  because  it  was  post  decision.   Ms  Miszkiel
         contended that Ahmed and Another (PBS: admissible evidence)  [2014]
         UKUT 00365 (IAC) showed that the judge  should  not  have  admitted
         such evidence, notwithstanding that the Appellants had asked him to
         do so.  Consideration of post decision evidence was  not  permitted
         in Points Based System appeals.

      6. Ms Miszkiel further submitted that in any event the judge ought  to
         have found procedural unfairness at common law by the Secretary  of
         State and returned the decisions to be remade  in  accordance  with
         the law.  The Appellants had not  been  given  the  opportunity  to
         comment on the alleged discrepancies in their respective records of
         interview prior to the issue  of  the  decisions  embodied  in  the
         reasons for refusal letters.  This was such an obvious  example  of
         unfairness  that  the  judge  should  have  spotted  the  point  in
         accordance with the principles of R v the Secretary  of  State  for
         the Home Department, ex p Robinson [1997] 3  WLR  1162.   The  fact
         that the point had not been raised before the judge at the  hearing
         and had not been taken in the Notice of Appeal was immaterial.

      7.  Counsel  further  submitted  that  the  effect  of  refusing   the
         adjournment was that the First  Appellant  was  not  able  to  give
         evidence of matters which could and should have been  put  to  her,
         for example, in relation to inconsistencies  between  the  partners
         about their business as the reasons for refusal letter had  claimed
         had emerged at their respective interviews.   The  absence  of  the
         First Appellant from the hearing was significant.  Counsel reminded
         the tribunal that the hearing had been conducted under  the  Asylum
         and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rule 2005 (as amended).

      8. Mr Whitwell for  the  Respondent  submitted  that  the  Appellants'
         grounds of onwards appeal were internally inconsistent.  The  judge
         was not under any  Robinson  (above)  duty.   The  Appellants  were
         represented by solicitors and counsel and it was for them to  raise
         the points they wished the judge to consider.   Paragraph  245DD(j)
         of the Immigration Rules created a discretion in the  Secretary  of
         State to call for additional information but no duty to do so.  The
         judge had been entitled to refuse the adjournment application  made
         to him as the medical certificate failed to  show  that  the  First
         Appellant was unfit to attend court.  The Appellants had  not  been
         prevented  from  presenting  their  appeals.   There  had  been  no
         procedural unfairness at any stage.

      9. In reply Ms  Miszkiel  reiterated  her  earlier  submissions.   The
         Appellants had been unfairly treated.

     10. At the conclusion of submissions I indicated that I found that  the
         judge had not fallen into material error of  law  and  reserved  my
         determination, which now follows.

     11. The judge was obliged to consider the application  to  adjourn  the
         hearing in accordance with rules  21  and  19  of  the  Asylum  and
         Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules  2005  (as  amended),  which
         were in force at the  date  of  the  hearing,  but  which  are  now
         obsolete.  Rule  4,  the  overriding  objective,  applied  to  that
         consideration, as the judge noted at  [15]  of  his  determination.
         Rule 21 provided that the tribunal must not adjourn a hearing of an
         appeal unless satisfied that the appeal cannot otherwise be  justly
         determined.  Rule 19 provided that the tribunal may hear an  appeal
         in the absence of a party or his representative if  satisfied  that
         there is no good reason for such absence.  Judge  Fox  plainly  had
         all three rules in mind.

     12. From the medical certificate  provided  by  the  First  Appellant's
         local GP in London SW18, the judge noted that the  First  Appellant
         was not certified to be unfit to attend court,  i.e.,  a  potential
         time span of an hour or so, plus return  travel.   The  judge  must
         have noted that the Appellant's home address was  in  London  SW18,
         which is no more than 7 miles from the Richmond court (postcode TW9
         2RF) and thus perhaps 30-45 minutes away.   The  judge  would  also
         have noted that the medical certificate was  vague  in  its  terms.
         The fact as the judge noted that the  appeal  had  previously  been
         adjourned because of the First Appellant's health  was  a  relevant
         consideration.  There was no indication as to  when  she  might  be
         free of the health  difficulties  she  asserted.    The  judge  had
         before him a witness statement for the First Appellant prepared  by
         her solicitors and the Third Appellant  who  had  also  provided  a
         witness statement was  present  at  the  hearing.  The  Appellant's
         counsel was present.  It was thus open to  the  judge  to  conclude
         that there was no good reason for the First Appellant's absence and
         that an adjournment was not required to enable  the  appeal  to  be
         justly determined and  further  was  not  in  accordance  with  the
         overriding objective.

     13. If, as Ms Miszkiel contended, the judge had failed to  have  proper
         regard to Ahmed and Another (above), by considering  post  decision
         evidence provided by the Appellants, it is impossible  to  see  how
         that could have prejudiced the Appellants.  The judge simply did as
         they had requested him.  Ahmed and Another (above) was not cited to
         the judge, yet the Appellants' solicitor and counsel were  under  a
         duty to do so if it were relevant.  There  can  be  no  conceivable
         unfairness to the Appellants as the result of the judge's approach,
         whether or not it was  impermissibly  generous.   It  follows  that
         whether Ms Miszkiel's interpretation of Ahmed and  Another  (above)
         may be unduly restrictive need not be decided.

     14. The submission that the judge should have  considered  for  himself
         whether there had been procedural unfairness by  the  Secretary  of
         State  at  the  decision  making  stage  was  in  my  judgment   an
         extravagant and mistaken one.  No such allegation had been made  in
         the Appellants' Notice of Appeal nor was any such  submission  made
         to the judge.  The point was not so obvious  that  it  should  have
         been taken by him, whether or  not  Robinson  is  capable  of  such
         extension, which in my view  is  dubious.   The  judge's  r�le  was
         adjudicative, not  inquisitorial.   But  Ms  Miszkiel's  point  was
         surely wrong in any event.  As Mr Whitwell submitted, the Secretary
         of State  has  the  option  of  seeking  additional  evidence  from
         applicants under  paragraph  245DD(j)  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
         There is no duty, as the power is discretionary.   The rule appears
         to be a statement of the obvious, but perhaps it is needed for  the
         avoidance of doubt.  The opportunity for  applicants  to  challenge
         the Respondent's decision(s) is provided for by means of an  appeal
         to the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The  Respondent  did  not  have  to
         maintain an open dialogue with the Appellants.

     15. Ms Miszkiel's final point, that  the  First  Appellant  could  have
         given evidence on  significant  issues  had  she  been  granted  an
         adjournment, had no substance.   The  essence  of  the  Appellants'
         claim was that the First Appellant and  the  Third  Appellant  were
         partners with a viable  and  credible  business.   They  and  their
         advisors were all well aware of  the  grounds  of  refusal  of  the
         applications.  The First Appellant had the opportunity to deal with
         any relevant matter in her witness statement, which was, of course,
         her evidence in chief, and where she was obliged to state the facts
         or matters  on  which  she  relied.  Rule  53  of  the  Asylum  and
         Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 (as amended) emphasised
         that the burden of proof lies on the appellant to show that  he  or
         she complies with the Immigration Rules.

     16. Moreover, and equally importantly, the Third Appellant was  at  the
         hearing and gave evidence.  It was open to him to offer evidence on
         any fact  or  matter  within  his  knowledge,  whether  hearsay  or
         otherwise.  The rules of evidence do not apply  to  the  First-tier
         Tribunal: see rule  51  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal
         (Procedure) Rules 2005 (as amended).  There was no suggestion  that
         the judge did not endeavour to obtain the best  evidence  available
         about the appeals before reaching his decision. The Appellants were
         not restricted, even where Ms Miszkiel  says  they  ought  to  have
         been.  If the Appellants failed to raise an important matter,  that
         was down to them.  It was not unfairness on Judge Fox's part.

     17. The tribunal concludes that that the Appellants have failed to show
         any material error of law  in  the  determination.   Their  onwards
         appeals are accordingly dismissed.


    DECISION


    The making of the previous decision did not involve the  making  of  an
    error on a point of law.  The determination stands unchanged
