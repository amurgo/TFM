                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

For the Appellant:     Mr J Greer, Broudie Jackson & Canter
For the Respondent:    Mr C Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  or  a
Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  original
Appellant/parties in this determination identified  as  MS.  This  direction
applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any failure  to  comply  with  this
direction could give rise to contempt of court proceedings


      1. MS is an asylum seeker from Iran. He claims to  have  converted  to
         Christianity. His claim was refused by the respondent  for  reasons
         set out in a letter dated 29th November 2016.  His  appeal  against
         the refusal of his protection and human rights claim was  dismissed
         by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Moore  for  reasons  set  out  in  a
         decision promulgated on 7th February 2017.


      2. MS applied for, and  was  granted,  permission  to  appeal  on  the
         grounds

          i) It  was  arguable  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  had  made
             perverse/irrational  findings  that  the  appellant  had   not
             attended an underground church in Iran; and
         ii) It was arguable  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  had  sought
             corroborative evidence to support the  contention  that  there
             was an arrest warrant issued against the appellant; and
        iii) It was arguable the rejection of Pastor  Hemus'  evidence  and
             treating that evidence as incredulous  was  not  supported  by
             adequate reasoning  and  contrary  to  established  principles
             namely R (on the application of  SA)  Iran  [2012]  EWHC  2575
             (Admin).


      3. Although expressed as separate grounds,  the  material  upon  which
         they are pleaded is common to each, and at  its  core,  is  reliant
         upon the treatment of the  evidence  of  Pastor  Hemus.  There  are
         contradictions and  inconsistencies  recorded  in  the  appellant's
         evidence as set out in the decision around the number of times  the
         appellant attended the underground churches in Iran and his seeming
         lack of understanding of the two baptisms he underwent in  the  UK.
         Nevertheless it is perverse to conclude from that evidence that the
         appellant would not


             "... have attended the house church  in  Shiraz  when  he  was
             clearly aware of the dangers of doing so, particularly bearing
             in mind that according to the appellant, having spoken to Eman
             about attendance, he told his friend that he needed "to  think
             about it"."


         Such a conclusion belies the existence of the underground  churches
         in Iran and fails to consider the nature of belief developed  in  a
         country where religious belief contrary to  mainstream  belief  may
         have adverse consequences.


      4. The judge expressed incredulity at Pastor Hemus' evidence. Although
         Mr Bates submitted that although the language used by the Judge was
         perhaps not called for, and that the judge was expressing his  view
         that the Pastor was perhaps gullible and/or na�ve, that is not  how
         the judge expressed himself. The Pastor was firm in his evidence of
         the appellant's conversion and  provided  an  explanation  why  the
         appellant may not have  understood  whether  or  not  he  had  been
         baptised - a matter considered in Dorodian/SA. The judge failed  to
         address the evidence in that context.  Dismissal  of  the  Pastor's
         evidence based on incredulity without any apparent  examination  of
         how or to what extent the Pastor has been na�ve and /or gullible is
         a material error of law. The Pastor was not, from the record as  it
         appears  in  the  decision,  questioned  about,  for  example,  his
         experience of converts, how he  reached  his  conclusion  that  the
         appellant was genuine and whether he had  given  evidence  in  such
         cases before. In the absence of a reasoned  basis  for  questioning
         the reliability of the Pastor's conclusions, it is perverse for the
         judge to conclude that his evidence carried little weight.


      5. The issue of the arrest warrant was not  canvassed  before  me  and
         seems to be of little impact. The material errors of law  are  such
         that this decision has to be set aside to be remade.

      6. The scheme of the Tribunals Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not
         assign the function of primary fact finding to the Upper  Tribunal.
         The nature and extent of fact finding required in  this  appeal  is
         such that it should be remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
         rehearing, no findings of fact preserved.


    Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not*  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

    I set aside the decision and remit it to the First-tier Tribunal to  be
    remade, no findings of fact preserved.


    Anonymity


    The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of  the
    Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.


    I continue that order (pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
