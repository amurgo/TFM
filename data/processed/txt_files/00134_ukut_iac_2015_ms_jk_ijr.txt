    JUDGE CRAIG: The applicants in this case are a married couple who claim
    to have been in this country since 1995.  They  have  never  had  valid
    leave to be in this country lawfully.  In 2010 they made an application
    to be allowed to remain on the grounds of long residence and if it  had
    been accepted at that stage that they had indeed been in  this  country
    since 1995 there is no reason why  that  application  should  not  have
    succeeded.  However, the respondent  refused  the  application  because
    those acting on her behalf were not  satisfied  on  the  basis  of  the
    evidence which had been provided that the applicants had been  in  this
    country for as long as they claimed.

 2. It is accepted on behalf of the applicants that the respondent was  not
    obliged at that stage to make a removal decision and she did not do so.
     This was not an immigration decision and  accordingly  the  applicants
    were not entitled to an in country right of appeal; if the decision had
    been one which was wholly unreasonable it would have been open to  them
    at that stage to have brought judicial review proceedings in respect of
    this decision but they did not do so.

 3. Thereafter on 2 April 2013 the applicants made a fresh  application  to
    be allowed to remain  in  which  they  asked  for  their  claim  to  be
    considered under Article 8.  This was refused by the respondent  on  22
    May 2013 by reference to the Rules then in  force.   In  that  decision
    letter it is clear  that  the  respondent  gave  consideration  to  the
    applicants' claim under Article 8 in accordance with the provisions set
    out within the Rules but also  in  accordance  with  normal  Article  8
    principles as set out within the House  of  Lords  decision  in  Razgar
    [2004] UKHL 27. Subsequently, on 25 June 2013  the  respondent  gave  a
    further decision in which she certified that the claim which  had  been
    made was one to which section 94(3) of the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002 applied.  This decision was made in the following terms
    at paragraph 25:

         "In addition, your clients' human rights  claim  is  one  to  which
         Section 94(3) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002
         applies.  This requires the Secretary of State to certify that  the
         claim is clearly unfounded unless she is satisfied that it  is  not
         clearly  unfounded.   After  consideration  of  all  the   evidence
         available, it has been decided that your clients' claim is  clearly
         unfounded.  Therefore, it is hereby certified under  Section  94(2)
         of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 that your claim
         is clearly unfounded.  This means that your client may  not  appeal
         while in the United Kingdom."

 4. Within this letter it is clear that the respondent  gave  consideration
    to the provisions within the Rules but also had  consideration  to  the
    personal factors applicable to these applicants.  In particular it  was
    noted at paragraph 20 that they had claimed  to  have  entered  the  UK
    illegally  in  September  1995  "therefore  allegedly   accruing   long
    residence within the UK".  The respondent did not consider on the basis
    of the evidence supplied that there was any proper basis upon  which  a
    different decision should now be reached with regard to whether or  not
    the applicants had been in the UK as long as  they  claimed  from  that
    already reached when the original application had been  refused  on  25
    February 2011.  Moreover, at paragraph 23 it was noted that "there  are
    no known circumstances beyond their control which have prevented  their
    return to India"  and  that  it  was  "only  through  their  choice  of
    remaining here without permission that has allowed  them  to  allegedly
    accrue UK residence since September 1995"; accordingly it is clear that
    the respondent also gave consideration to the applicants' claim on  the
    alternative basis that they might  have  been  here  as  long  as  they
    asserted.   However,  even  on  this  basis  the  respondent  found  at
    paragraph 24 that:

         "All your client and his spouse's circumstances,  including  family
         and private life have been considered in the round  but  there  are
         insufficient factors to justify allowing them to remain in the UK".

 5. It was after consideration of these factors that  the  respondent  made
    the decision to certify the claim  as  clearly  unfounded  and  as  the
    respondent has noted the Secretary of State is required so  to  certify
    "unless  she  is  satisfied  that  it  is   not   clearly   unfounded".
    Subsequently the applicants made renewed applications which were  again
    refused but the applicants no  longer  rely  on  the  contents  of  the
    decisions in respect of these applicants to advance their case.

 6. Within section 3 of the claim form it is said that the decision  of  26
    June 2013 which is sought to be judicially reviewed is:

         "[A] decision dated 26/06/2013 by which the defendant  refused  the
         claimant and his dependant application for leave to remain  in  the
         UK and decision to remove them from the UK".

    There is not contained within this a specific challenge to the decision
    to certify the claim as clearly unfounded although  it  might  be  said
    that that is implicit within the claim.

 7. Permission to bring this application  was  granted  by  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge McKee and the application is now before me today. Although within
    the grounds challenge had been brought to the decisions made subsequent
    to the decision of 26 June  2013,  on  the  basis  that  they  had  not
    themselves been certified, on behalf of the applicants Ms Shaw properly
    accepted that as the original decision of 26 June 2013,  which  is  the
    only  one  which  has  formally  been  challenged,  was  certified  the
    subsequent decisions could be justified on the basis that they had been
    considered under paragraph 353 of the Rules and they did not raise  any
    substantially different grounds.   Her  submission  was  a  commendably
    brief one.  It was that the threshold which had to be satisfied  before
    a decision could properly be certified under Section 94(2) was  a  high
    one and in the circumstances of this case, having spent on  their  case
    over fifteen years continuously within the UK  (by  the  time  of  this
    decision they would on the applicants' case have been in  this  country
    around eighteen years), it could not properly be said that  their  case
    did not have "a realistic prospect  of  success".   In  Ms  Shaw's  own
    words:

         "the PAP does refer to substantial evidence submitted in support of
         the applicants having spent by then fifteen years' continuous  stay
         in the UK, and this therefore must have  amounted  to  a  realistic
         prospect of success and so should not have been certified".

 8. Ms Shaw referred to what was said in the decision of the House of Lords
    in ZT (Kosovo) [2009] UKHL 6; although the court in that case had  been
    considering whether or not there might be a  distinction  to  be  drawn
    between the test under section 94  of  the  2002  Act  and  that  under
    paragraph 353 of the rules, nonetheless it was made  clear  that  cases
    should not be certified under either  test  unless  they  were  clearly
    unfounded.  In this case, she submitted,  essentially  because  of  the
    applicants' arguably long residence in the UK it could not be said that
    this case was bound to fail or that it was clearly unfounded.  For  the
    purposes of this judgment it is not necessary to consider whether there
    is any meaningful distinction between the tests set  out  at  paragraph
    353 of the rules and section 94 of the 2002 Act.  It was not  suggested
    on behalf of the applicants that other than with regard to their  lives
    with each other they enjoyed any family  life  in  this  country  which
    could be relied upon and nor was  it  suggested  that  there  were  any
    particular factors regarding their private life beyond their  claim  to
    have been here for a period which while long was less than  the  twenty
    years which is now required under the Rules.  Certainly no evidence  of
    any such factors was put before the  respondent  before  she  made  her
    decision to certify the claim as clearly unfounded and  none  has  been
    put before this Tribunal either.

 9. On behalf of the respondent Mr Harland made three  very  brief  points.
    His first was that the case now advanced was not the  case  as  pleaded
    because the challenge initially had been made on  the  basis  that  the
    later decisions had not  been  certified  and  there  had  not  been  a
    specific challenge to the decision to certify the  decision  now  under
    challenge.  His second point was that there was simply no  evidence  on
    which it could possibly be said that the applicants had any significant
    private life in this country and moreover there was not even sufficient
    evidence on which they could argue that they had been here since  1995.
    The only evidence referred to was of people who  had  claimed  to  have
    known the applicants and a letter from one person who  says  that  they
    had been a tenant since 2000.   Much  more  evidence  might  have  been
    expected.  Mr Harland's third point is perhaps his strongest  which  is
    that in the decision letter of 26  June  2013  it  is  clear  that  the
    respondent understood properly the implications of Section 94(3) of the
    2002 Act, which was that the respondent was  required  to  certify  the
    claim as clearly unfounded unless she was satisfied  that  it  was  not
    clearly unfounded.  On  the  basis  of  the  evidence  which  had  been
    advanced, given that the Rules had been changed  since  the  applicants
    had first applied, the respondent was effectively bound  to  find  that
    the claim was clearly unfounded.  Ms Shaw did not reply.

Discussion

10. I have of course had regard to the considerable body  of  jurisprudence
    following the implementation of the changes to the Rules  in  July  and
    September 2012 and in particular to the various decisions of the  Court
    of Appeal in Edgehill v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 402,  Haleemudeen  v  SSHD
    [2014] EWCA Civ 558 and Singh and Khalid v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 74,  in
    the most recent of which the court  summarises  the  various  decisions
    which have been made since the changes in the Rules and  in  particular
    discusses the application of the decisions in Edgehill and Haleemudeen,
    the latter decision having been made without Edgehill having been cited
    and being arguably inconsistent with the decision in Edgehill.

11. Prior to the decision in Singh and  Khalid  it  might  just  have  been
    possible for the applicants to have mounted an  argument  that  as  the
    original application had been refused under the  old  Rules  a  removal
    decision which was substantially founded on  that  decision  should  by
    virtue of the transitional provisions which originally took  effect  in
    July 2012 have been considered under the old Rules also and  not  under
    the Rules which had subsequently come into force.  Certainly  it  seems
    that this was the argument which in the  grounds  the  applicants  were
    seeking to advance because their case was put on  the  basis  that  the
    removal decision made subsequent to the 2011 decision should have  been
    considered under the old Rules.  Whether or not this  submission  would
    have been considered arguable is  not  something  I  have  to  consider
    because it is quite clear now following the Court of Appeal decision in
    Singh and Khalid that a removal decision made subsequent to the further
    change in the Rules in September 2012 must be considered on  the  basis
    of the new  Immigration  Rules  and  not  those  which  had  previously
    applied.  This is accepted on behalf of the applicants by Ms Shaw.

12. Accordingly the only basis upon which the respondent's  decision  could
    properly be challenged is that her decision to certify the claim on  26
    June 2014 as clearly unfounded was not a rational one.  In my  judgment
    this cannot possibly be said on the facts of this case.  The only basis
    upon which the claim has been advanced is that because  the  applicants
    have been here so long it cannot be said  that  the  claim  is  clearly
    unfounded.  That simply cannot be correct.  The Rules make provision as
    to how the respondent will consider applications made under  Article  8
    and  the  courts  from  Nagre  [2013]EWHC  720  (Admin)  onwards   have
    consistently made it clear that unless there is something  out  of  the
    ordinary (the word used in the Rules is "exceptional") beyond the  type
    of situation envisaged in the Rules it is not necessary for a  decision
    maker to dot every i or cross every t when considering  a  claim  under
    Article 8 outside the rules. In this case, there has been  no  evidence
    put either before the respondent or before the  Tribunal  which  is  or
    could be capable of persuading a decision maker that the  claim  should
    be allowed outside the Rules.  The Rules, which have been  approved  in
    Parliament, set out circumstances in  which  an  Article  8  claim  can
    succeed where an applicant has been in this  country  for  over  twenty
    years or in certain other  prescribed  circumstances.   None  of  these
    circumstances apply in this case and there is no other reason  advanced
    (beyond the fact that they have been in the UK for a long time, but  on
    any view less  than  20  years)  as  to  why  these  applicants  should
    nonetheless be allowed to remain.

13. In these circumstances the decision of the respondent to  certify  this
    claim as clearly unfounded was one which was clearly open to  her.   In
    my judgement, not only was this a rational decision,  but  no  decision
    maker properly applying his or her mind now to the evidence  which  has
    been put before  the  Tribunal  could  consider  other  than  that  the
    applicants'  claim  is  clearly  unfounded.   It  follows   that   this
    application must be dismissed and I so order.



Permission to appeal

14. Although no application has been made for permission to  appeal,  I  am
    nonetheless obliged to consider whether or not to grant  permission  to
    appeal pursuant to rule  44  (4B)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008.  I refuse permission to appeal because  there  is
    no error of law in my judgment.

Costs

15. I summarily assess costs in the sum of �3,350.
