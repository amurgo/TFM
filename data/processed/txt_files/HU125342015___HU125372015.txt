Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C McGinley, of Gray & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs R Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are brother and sister, born on  10  June  1998  and  10
    September 2004, citizens of the DRC  (Democratic  Republic  of  Congo).
    They both sought entry clearance to join their father,  "the  sponsor",
    in the UK.

 2. The ECO refused both applications, under  reference  to  �352D  of  the
    immigration rules and to article 8 of the ECHR, for reasons  stated  in
    notices dated 5 November 2015.

 3. The appellants appealed to the FtT.   The  statutory  basis  of  appeal
    available to them was limited to article 8.  They said in their grounds
    that they did meet the requirements of �325D; the decisions  to  refuse
    entry were  "therefore  a  disproportionate  interference"  with  their
    family and private life; the decisions were "contrary to  s.55  of  the
    Borders, Citizen and Immigration Act 2009"; and the family life of  the
    appellants and sponsor "cannot reasonably be  expected  to  be  enjoyed
    elsewhere".

 4. Judge Agnew refused the appeals for reasons explained in  her  decision
    promulgated on 16 November 2016.  She accepted at �29 that at the  time
    of application the requirements of the rules were met.  However, as  to
    article 8 she was not satisfied that there was "a meaningful  parent  /
    child relationship" (�30).  She agreed that compliance with �352D was a
    factor to take into account (�32) but found  the  evidence  "less  than
    frank, open and reliable" and that the decisions  had  a  proportionate
    outcome.

 5. The grounds of appeal to the UT refer to  Mostafa  [2015]  UKUT  00112,
    "... ability to satisfy the rules is not the question to be  determined
    but is capable of being a weighty,  though  not  determinative,  factor
    when deciding whether refusal is proportionate ... ".

 6. The grounds say that the judge failed to assess the article 8 appeal to
    the appropriate standard or to provide adequate reasons; there were  no
    inaccuracies within the entry clearance  applications;  the  impact  of
    refusal  on  the  relationship  between  sponsor  and  appellants   was
    erroneously considered; the refusals interfere disproportionately  with
    their relationships; the judge made too restricted an approach  to  the
    assessment; there was evidence that the sponsor's asylum claim was made
    in 2005 but refugee  status  granted  only  on  25  September  2013,  a
    circumstance outside his control; he could not visit  the  children  in
    the meantime; he lost contact, and re-established it only  through  the
    Red Cross in 2009; he visited the children in Kenya in 2015; and  there
    were compelling circumstances to justify the appeal being allowed.

 7. Mr McGinley submitted  further  as  follows.   Although  the  grant  of
    permission hinted that where further applications to the ECO  could  be
    made under the rules, article 8 might be irrelevant, that would  be  of
    no use to the first appellant, because he had reached the age of 18 (by
    the time of the hearing in the FtT) and  so  could  not  succeed  in  a
    further application under the rules.   It  would  be  an  even  plainer
    breach of article 8 to separate two siblings who had grown up together.
     Mr McGinley adopted the further observation  in  the  grant  that  the
    public interest in immigration control was [arguably] irrelevant  where
    the rules were met.  Mostafa arose from a visit  visa  application.   A
    case arising from a rule about refugee family reunion  had  a  stronger
    base.   The  rule  was  presumably  designed  to  bring  about  results
    compliant with article 8.  The sponsor had not  delayed  in  trying  to
    bring the children to the UK.  The evidence was  that  the  mother  had
    abandoned the children.  The appeal was one so obviously calling out to
    be allowed on family life grounds that it could  only  in  reason  have
    been allowed.

 8. Mrs Pettersen submitted that the judge's decision was justified by  her
    findings about the evidence, or  rather  the  absence  of  satisfactory
    evidence, as to the true state of family relationships.   She  accepted
    that the  comment  at  �33  that  the  sponsor's  connection  with  the
    appellants was no more than biological was not literally justified, but
    she said that was to be read in  context  of  the  findings  about  the
    contradictory and skimpy nature of the evidence, no "meaningful" parent
    / child relationship, and the  judge  not  being  satisfied  about  the
    clamed abandonment of the children by their mother and  the  nature  of
    their care over the years.  The reasoning of those conclusions was  not
    criticised in the grounds.  The judge was simply not satisfied that the
    evidence showed the true history and situation of the  appellants,  and
    so was entitled  to  conclude  that  no  disproportionate  outcome  was
    demonstrated.

 9. I reserved my decision.

10. I do not doubt that the rule is designed to comply with article  8,  as
    well as with the general  policy  of  refugee  family  reunion.   In  a
    straightforward case of reunion  of  all  core  family  members  (e.g.,
    mother and children together joining a husband  and  father)  it  seems
    likely that an erroneous refusal under  the  rules  would  fall  to  be
    corrected either by fresh applications to the ECO or, if that  was  not
    available for some reason, under article 8.  To that extent,  there  is
    force in the argument for the appellants.  However, the rule  does  not
    reflect article 8 to the absolute  effect  that  an  erroneous  refusal
    means that an appeal must succeed under article 8.  Whether  article  8
    rights exist and have  been  infringed,  and  whether  interference  is
    disproportionate, depends on the facts of the case.

11. The judge recognised at �31  the  positive  obligation  on  the  UK  to
    facilitate family reunion, and at �32 that meeting the  requirement  of
    the rules  was  a  factor  (which  could  only  be  in  favour  of  the
    appellants).

12. If the facts had been found to be as the appellants continue to  assert
    through the sponsor, the  outcome  would  almost  certainly  have  been
    different.  However, the judge explained at �9 - 28 why she found  that
    the evidence failed to establish the  contentions  advanced  about  the
    appellants' personal circumstances, the absence  of  relationship  with
    their mother, or the nature of their relationship  with  their  father.
    The grounds reassert the appellants' position as if it were established
    fact, but show no error in the judge's findings to the  contrary.   The
    evidence was found  to  be  very  weak,  for  reasons  which  have  not
    significantly  been  criticised.   The  grounds  in  essence  are  only
    disagreement with findings properly reached, and with a proportionality
    assessment which was based on those  findings,  is  explained  in  some
    detail at �33 - 38, and falls within the judge's reasonable range.  The
    UT has no basis on which to interfere.

13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

14. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
