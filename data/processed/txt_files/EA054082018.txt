                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                            DECISION AND REASONS

BACKGROUND TO THE APPEAL

1.   The Appellant is  a  national  of  Morocco.  He  married  a  Lithuanian
    national on 3 October 2011.   The Appellant was issued with a residence
    card as the family member of an EEA national on 12 March 2013. The card
    was valid until 12 March 2018.

2.   The  Appellant  petitioned  for  divorce  on  27  April  2018  and  the
    Appellant's wife acknowledged service of the petition on 25 July 2018.

3.   Meanwhile, on 12 March 2018 the Appellant had applied for  a  permanent
    residence card as the direct family member of an  EEA  national.   This
    application was refused.

4.   He appealed but his appeal was dismissed by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Keith in  a  decision  promulgated  on  22  February  2019.  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Lever refused the Appellant permission to appeal  on  10
    April 2019 but Upper Tribunal Judge Canavan granted him  permission  to
    appeal on 30 May 2019 on a limited basis.

5.   The appeal came before me on 28 June 2019 and I found  that  there  had
    been an error of law in First-tier Tribunal Judge Keith's decision.  At
    the hearing before First-tier Tribunal Judge Keith  the  Appellant  had
    not relied on any retained right of residence even though by  the  date
    of the hearing he had obtained a decree absolute.  This was because the
    Home Office Presenting Officer had submitted that the reliance  on  the
    divorce would amount to a new matter and he was not prepared to consent
    to it being considered at the hearing.

6.   However, the refusal letter under  appeal  had  also  stated  that  the
    Appellant's application had been considered under Regulation 15 of  the
    Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2016  ("the  2016
    Regulations") which relates to his entailment to permanent residence as
    the spouse of an EEA national.

7.   Permission to appeal had been granted on  the  sole  issue  of  whether
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Keith had taken  into  account  the  reported
    decision  of  Barnett  and   Others   (EEA   Regulation;   rights   and
    documentation) [2012] UKUT 00142, where the Upper Tribunal found:

         "(3) The "proof" that the Secretary of State can  lawfully  require
         in applications under regulations 17 and 18 in order to  entitle  a
         non- EEA  national  to  a  residence  card  (regulation  17)  or  a
         permanent  residence  card  (regulation  18)   may,   nevertheless,
         depending on  the  circumstances,  entail  the  production  of  the
         passport or other identity document of an EEA national; but  it  is
         unlawful to refuse applications merely because  such  documentation
         is not forthcoming.  The Secretary of State needs to show  a  valid
         reason why it is required.

         (4)  This is particularly so in the case of  regulation  18,  given
         that there is likely to  be  relevant  material  relating  to  such
         documentation on file from a previous, successful, application".

8.   Barnett was decided under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 ("the 2006 Regulations")  but  there  is  no  material
    difference between Regulation 17 of the 2006 Regulations and Regulation
    21 of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2016  ("the
    2016 Regulations").

9.   In the light of the case of Barnet, the absence of his wife's  passport
    or identity  document  was  not  sufficient  to  justify  refusing  him
    permanent residence.

10.  However, the Home Office Presenting Officer submitted that  this  error
    of law was not a  material  one  as  the  Appellant  had  not  provided
    sufficient evidence to establish that his wife had exercised  a  Treaty
    right for the required five-year period.

11.  In some circumstances, that would have been  the  end  of  the  matter.
    However, in the current case,  neither  the  Respondent  or  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge had applied their minds to the evidence related  to  the
    exercise of the wife's Treaty rights.

12.  Therefore, I found that it was in the interests of  justice  to  retain
    the case in the Upper Tribunal in order for  there  to  be  a  de  novo
    hearing at  which  all  outstanding  issues  relating  to  whether  the
    Appellant has acquired a permanent or a  retained  right  of  residence
    could be decided.  I also gave a direction, pursuant to rule 5(3)(d) of
    the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008,  as  amended,  that
    the Respondent obtain any relevant records about  the  Appellant's  ex-
    wife's employment in the United Kingdom between 3 October 2011  and  18
    January 2019. This was on the basis that this remained the only  matter
    of dispute between the parties.

13.  The renewed hearing was set down for 7  October  2019.  However,  on  2
    September 2019, I received an email from Mr. Kotas  at  the  Specialist
    Appeals Team, which stated:

         "I can confirm in accordance with direction (1) that the Respondent
         made  enquiries  of  HMRC  regarding  the  appellant's  ex-spouse's
         employment history. The information received confirms that the  ex-
         spouse/sponsor was exercising treaty rights for  the  relevant  tax
         years from 2011-2018, therefore the  Respondent  is  now  satisfied
         that the appellant acquired a permanent right of residence pursuant
         to Regulation 15(1)(b) of the 2016 Regulations. The  Respondent  is
         therefore content for the Upper Tribunal  to  remake  the  decision
         allowing the appellant's appeal on the papers without the need  for
         a further hearing.".

14.  Therefore, I allow the Appellant's appeal on the basis that it  is  now
    accepted by the Respondent that the Appellant has acquired a  permanent
    right of residence in the United Kingdom under Regulation 15.

Decision

(1)  The Appellant's appeal is allowed.
