     DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Details of the Appellant and Proceedings


  1. The appellant was born on 22nd  November  1983  and  is  a  citizen  of
     Zimbabwe.  She appealed before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Wright  (the
     Judge) against the decisions of the respondent to refuse  to  vary  her
     leave to remain in the United Kingdom and to remove her from the United
     Kingdom by way of directions  under  section  47  of  the  Immigration,
     Nationality and Asylum Act 2006.  The appeal was  dismissed  under  the
     immigration Rules, Articles 8 and 3 of  the  ECHR  in  a  determination
     promulgated on 18th July 2014.


  2. Permission to appeal against the decision of the  Judge  to  the  Upper
     Tribunal was granted on 7th August 2014 by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
     Grant-Hutchinson because it was  considered  arguable  that  the  Judge
     failed to consider


      a)  the background country information on Zimbabwe which  was  lodged
         concerning returning the appellant  as a lone female and her child
         which was raised in the skeleton argument and submissions;
      b)  the fact that the appellant did endeavour to obtain a  Zimbabwean
         passport without success;
      c)  the child's father  has  no  immigration  status  as  a  Nigerian
         national.


      No consideration was made to the ability of  the  family  remaining  a
      family unit when considering section 55 best interests  of  the  child
      and the fact that he also has an outstanding application in the UK.


  3. The matter accordingly  came  before  me  for  an  initial  hearing  to
     determine whether the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved  the
     making of an error on a point of law.


Consideration of Submissions

  4. The key background facts of this matter are that the  appellant  is  of
     Zimbabwean nationality and came to the United Kingdom as a  visitor  in
     August 2002, aged 19 years. She was granted subsequent periods of leave
     during which time she studied and married a British  citizen  in  2010.
     The marriage broke down in 2011 and the parties separated.  Two  months
     later the appellant moved in with her current partner,  a  national  of
     Nigeria.


  5. On 13th November 2012 the appellant applied for further leave to remain
     on grounds of private life  without  making  any  mention  of  her  new
     partner or the impending birth of their child which  was  born  on  9th
     December 2012. The appellant stated on the application  form  that  she
     was married to a British citizen  resident  in  the  UK.   The  Judge's
     finding  about  the  application  was   that   the   appellant   relied
     misleadingly upon her marriage which had broken down almost a year ago.




  6. Ms Yong's submissions to me were that  the  Judge  misdirected  herself
     about the evidence, in particular in relation to whether the  appellant
     had ties with Zimbabwe. The appellant went to Zimbabwe when she  was  3
     months old but left and went to  Swaziland  at  8  years  of  age;  she
     remained there until she came to the United Kingdom in 2002, at the age
     of 19 years; she is now 30 years of age and no longer has  any  contact
     with Zimbabwe.  The Judge's findings are submitted to  be  contrary  to
     the evidence of the appellant that she has no support in  Zimbabwe,  no
     prospect of employment and no access  to  physiotherapy  treatment  she
     currently receives in the UK. Her last visit to Zimbabwe  was  for  her
     father's funeral and no contact is maintained with relatives there.


  7. The Judge's findings are submitted not to be based on the evidence.  Ms
     Young's submission is that if the Judge did not accept the  appellant's
     evidence it was incumbent upon her to give reasons for  those  findings
     and she failed to do so; the Judge failed to take into account that the
     appellant could not  renew  her  Zimbabwean  passport.   The  Judge  is
     submitted to have failed to take account of  the  appellant's  fear  of
     being returned to Zimbabwe as a young female or as mother with a child.


  8. The Judge is submitted to have failed to take account of the background
     country information referenced in the skeleton  argument  and  in  oral
     submissions before her. It  is  submitted  that  the  Judge  could  not
     properly assess the best interests of the child under  section  55  and
     Article 8  without  considering  the  adverse  impact  of  the  country
     situation upon the appellant and her child. Further error is alleged in
     the  Judge's  failure  to  find  compelling  circumstances  to  warrant
     consideration under Article 8.


  9. Ms Yong submits that the Judge failed to consider that the  appellant's
     partner is Nigerian, not Zimbabwean; nor did she take  account  of  his
     pending application to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The  Judge's
     finding that a child aged 1� years old could maintain contact with  its
     father by modern means of contact is submitted to  be  flippant;  there
     could be no  meaningful  relationship  through  such  means.   Ms  Yong
     challenges the Judge's finding that a child could be sent  to  Zimbabwe
     in circumstances where her mother would have no employment  or  income.
     She challenges the Judge's finding that the appellant was misleading in
     making her application with reference to her estranged husband but  not
     her partner; she submits that the un-born child could not  be  included
     in the application as it was not then a dependant. The Judge failed  to
     consider Beoku-Betts in considering the  position  of  the  appellant's
     partner.


 10. Mr Avery submitted that the Judge was entitled to find ties to Zimbabwe
     in circumstances where the appellant was trying to obtain a  Zimbabwean
     passport.  He submitted that it is not clear how the  appellant  relies
     upon the background information, whether  it  is  said  to  show  undue
     harshness, or to be  part  of  an  Article  8  consideration.  Ms  Yong
     responded by saying that  the  question  of  ties  in  Zimbabwe  is  of
     relevance to Article 8 and at the time of the hearing  the  appellant's
     partner's application had been  allowed  to  the  extent  that  further
     information was sought, thereby giving rise to an expectation.


 11. Mr Avery relied upon the judge's finding that the appellant could  find
     employment in Zimbabwe so that there  was  no  question  of  her  being
     destitute  there;  in  these  circumstances  he  submitted   that   the
     background  evidence  becomes  irrelevant.   Nor  does  the  background
     evidence show that the general situation in Zimbabwe is  such  that  it
     would be disproportionate  for  the  appellant  to  return  there.  The
     evidence of her partner was not that he would not support her.


 12. Mr Avery  also  relied  upon  the  Judge's  credibility  findings.   He
     submitted that the evidence before the Judge was that  the  appellant's
     partner has no basis of stay in the United Kingdom and it is  therefore
     speculative to suggest in those  circumstances  that  the  family  unit
     would remain intact if the appellant remains in the  UK;  there  is  no
     such certainty. The choice of the appellant's partner is not to  go  to
     Zimbabwe with her but Mr Avery submitted that  the  appellant  and  her
     partner have the choice of going together, as a  family  unit,  to  his
     country of nationality, namely Nigeria.

 13. Taking account of the grounds of appeal, the permission to  appeal  and
     all the submissions before me I am satisfied for the following  reasons
     that the Judge has not erred in law in making her decision. A number of
     the challenges to the Judge's decision amount in my  view  to  no  more
     than a continuing disagreement with findings reached by  her  to  which
     she was entitled to come. At paragraph  27  of  her  determination  the
     Judge makes a clear finding that both the appellant and her partner are
     not people of truth or credibility. She reached this conclusion in  the
     light of their  evidence  under  cross-examination,  their  immigration
     histories and the appellant's criminal convictions.


 14. The Judge took account of the appellant's criminal caution  for  making
     false representations including her entitlement to work in the UK,  her
     purchase and use of a false passport with a fake visa and her provision
     to the police of a false name  when  she  was  stopped  for  a  driving
     offence. The Judge took into account the appellant's  6-month  sentence
     of imprisonment for offences of theft from residents  in  a  care  home
     where she worked; she had been in a position of trust  and  had  stolen
     from vulnerable victims. She was convicted by a jury after pleading not
     guilty in the Crown Court.


 15. In these circumstances  I  find  no  merit  in  any  ground  of  appeal
     challenging the rejection of the appellant's  evidence  by  the  Judge,
     including her rejection of the appellant's claim to  have  no  ties  in
     Zimbabwe.  I am satisfied that the Judge was  entitled  to  reject  the
     appellant's evidence and to reach adverse credibility findings  in  the
     light of her clearly stated reasons for doing so. I do not  accept  the
     submission that the Judge failed to  give  reasons  for  rejecting  the
     appellant's evidence.


 16. The Judge has made a very full note of all the evidence and submissions
     in her determination and took  adequate  account  in  my  view  of  the
     relevant background information.  She records, in paragraph 10  of  the
     determination, the appellant's claim that she would be without work and
     medical support in Zimbabwe. However, the Judge specifically found,  in
     paragraph 40  of  the  determination,  that  the  BA  Hons  degree  the
     appellant has obtained in the  United  Kingdom  will  assist  with  her
     employment prospects in Zimbabwe.


 17. In the final paragraph of her determination  the  Judge  observed  that
     there was only a passing reference to Article 3  of  the  ECHR  in  the
     grounds of appeal in general terms.  She states  that  the  appellant's
     representative did not rely on Article  3  in  submissions  or  in  her
     skeleton argument.  I find no  error  in  these  circumstances  in  the
     Judge's  consideration  of  the  evidence  before  her  including  such
     background evidence as she found relevant.


 18. The Judge was in my view entitled to find that the appellant  had  ties
     in Zimbabwe in the light of her response in cross-examination when  she
     was asked whether she had researched the  job  situation  in  Zimbabwe.
     She replied that she had looked last year  generally  at  the  economic
     situation there; she said that she had spoken to people about  Zimbabwe
     and Africa.  The appellant's evidence, also recorded in paragraph 10 of
     the determination, was that her father's  nieces  and  nephews  are  in
     Zimbabwe; the Judge noted the lack of supporting evidence to  show  the
     appellant's father to be deceased as claimed in Zimbabwe.


 19. The Judge directed herself in accordance with the case of Ogundimu  and
     took account of the appellant's evidence that she speak the language of
     Shona which is spoken in Zimbabwe.  The Judge found that the  appellant
     has cousins in Zimbabwe and  on  her  own  admission  at  the  date  of
     application she was in the process of renewing her Zimbabwean passport,
     although it was then taking longer than she expected.  The Judge was in
     my view justified in concluding that the evidence as a  whole  amounted
     to a continuing connection to life in Zimbabwe. In these  circumstances
     I do not accept that the Judge erred in any  failure  to  consider  the
     position of the appellant on return to Zimbabwe as  a  lone  female  or
     mother.  The Judge does not accept  that  on  return  to  Zimbabwe  the
     appellant would be without family, prospects, or connections.


 20. Nor do not I accept the submission that the Judge erred in  finding  no
     compelling circumstances or any exceptional  reasons  to  consider  the
     matter under Article 8 of the ECHR.  She undertook a  careful  analysis
     of the evidence and in paragraphs 33 -  40  of  her  determination  and
     directed herself appropriately in relation to a range of relevant  case
     law.  In  paragraph  39  of  her  determination  the  Judge  found  the
     relationship between the appellant and her partner to have been  formed
     in circumstances they knew to be precarious for immigration purposes.


 21. In paragraph 39 of the determination the Judge took account of the best
     interests of the child and found those to be that she remain  with  her
     mother; there was no question that they would  be  separated  from  one
     another in the event of the appellant's removal; they would be  removed
     together. The Judge in my view directed herself quite properly that the
     child's best interests were a primary consideration. The Judge  further
     directed herself in accordance with the case of Azimi-Moyayed that as a
     starting point it is in the interests of children to be with both their
     parents. In paragraph 40 the judge reminded herself that the  child  in
     this case is not British and does not therefore have entitlement to the
     benefits that go with that nationality.


 22. I am satisfied that  the  Judge  was  well  aware  of  the  appellant's
     partner's application and took it into account.  In paragraph 14 of the
     determination she records his  evidence  that  he  has  an  outstanding
     appeal with the Home Office which was remitted  in  January  2014.  The
     Judge took account of the impact on  the  appellant's  partner  of  her
     removal as follows. In paragraph 39  of  her  determination  the  Judge
     found:


         "the child's father...is free to leave  the  UK  to  be  with  them
         regardless of the outcome of his outstanding (claimed)  immigration
         appeal (said to be against refusal of permanent residence based  on
         an EEA marriage here following his illegal entry  into  the  UK  in
         2002 on a passport for which he admitted he paid �600 and  knew  to
         be false/not to be his) and that it would be  unreasonable  in  all
         the circumstances for him to do so (if his  relationship  with  the
         appellant is truly genuine as claimed)."


 23. The Judge took into account the evidence  of  the  appellant's  partner
     that he would not go  to  Zimbabwe  with  her;  he  said  he  would  be
     devastated by the separation but he has been present in the UK  for  10
     years and has work here. The Judge further noted that the appellant  is
     still married to her British husband and not to the father of her child
     .I do not accept that the Judge failed to take account of the  Nigerian
     nationality of the appellant's partner.


 24. In paragraph 39 of her determination the Judge took full account of the
     nationality of all the parties involved; she notes that it was accepted
     that neither the appellant,  her  partner,  nor  their  child  has  any
     immigration  status  in  the  United  Kingdom.  I  find  merit  in  the
     submission made for the respondent that the evidence before  the  Judge
     was that the appellant's partner has no basis of  stay  in  the  United
     Kingdom  and  it  is  therefore  speculative  to   suggest   in   those
     circumstances that the family unit would remain intact if the appellant
     remains in the UK; there is no such certainty.


 25. Looking at the determination as a whole I am satisfied that  the  Judge
     has reached reasoned conclusions to which she was entitled to come.   I
     find no misdirection in law, no failure to consider relevant factors or
     evidence. I find that the making of the decision did  not  involve  the
     making of any error on a point of law and it follows that  the  Judge's
     decision stands and this appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
