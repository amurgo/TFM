Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr A Chohan, of Counsel, instructed by AWS
Solicitors Ltd.
For the Respondent:    Mr. P. Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, born on 7 September  1987.  He
    has been granted permission to appeal against a decision  of  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Turnock who, following a hearing  on  14  March
    2016, dismissed his appeal against a decision of the  respondent  of  7
    September 2015 refusing his application of  7  July  2015  for  further
    leave to remain as the spouse of Aishe Sehr Saad Malik (the "sponsor"),
    a British citizen.

 2. The judge dismissed the appellant's appeal under the Immigration  Rules
    and on human rights. In relation to his decision under the Rules, it is
    clear that he only took into account the sponsor's earnings. It is also
    clear that he considered that, in relation to the  sponsor's  earnings,
    the appellant  had  submitted  only  25  payslips  (as  opposed  to  26
    payslips, as had been contended). He therefore found that the appellant
    had not submitted the sponsor's payslips for the period of  six  months
    ending on the date of the application.

 3. The evidence before the judge was that the respondent accepted that the
    appellant's earnings gross  annual  earnings  were  �8,444.80  and  the
    sponsor's gross annual earnings were �12,478.96.

 4. At the hearing before me, Mr Duffy accepted that, as the appellant  had
    applied for leave to  remain  in-country,  his  gross  annual  earnings
    should have been into account as well as  the  sponsor's  gross  annual
    earnings. Mr Duffy accepted that the appellant satisfied the applicable
    minimum income requirement ("MIR") of �18,600 because he had  submitted
    evidence with his application that showed  that  he  had  gross  annual
    earnings of �8,444.80 and that the sponsor had gross annual earnings of
    �12,478.96. He accepted that the judge therefore  materially  erred  in
    law in finding that the appellant did not satisfy the MIR.

 5. In addition, in relation to Appendix FM-SE, Mr Duffy accepted that,  if
    it had been the case that the appellant had only submitted 25  payslips
    with his application, the circumstances fells within  the  respondent's
    Evidential Flexibility Policy and therefore that the respondent  should
    have requested the missing payslip.

 6. Accordingly, Mr Duffy accepted that the judge should have  allowed  the
    appeal under the Rules.

 7. In relation to the judge's decision on Article  8,  Mr  Duffy  accepted
    that the judge's material error in relation to the MIR also  materially
    affected his decision in relation to Article 8.

 8. For the reasons given by Mr  Duffy,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  judge
    materially erred in law in reaching his decision to dismiss the  appeal
    under the Rules and on human rights. I therefore set aside his decision
    in its entirely.

 9. For the reasons given at para 3-5 above and as Mr Duffy agreed, I allow
    the appellant's appeal under the Rules. There is therefore no  need  to
    consider the Article 8 claim outside the Rules.

      Decision

    The making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that it fell to be set aside.
    I set aside the decision.  I  re-make  the  decision  by  allowing  the
    appellant's  appeal  against  the  respondent's  decision   under   the
    Immigration Rules.
