For the respondent:    Mr K Wood, Home Office presenting officer

A person who entered the United Kingdom with  entry  clearance  as  a  short
term student prior to 1 September 2007,  although  subject  to  a  condition
prohibiting work, was admitted to the United  Kingdom  in  possession  of  a
valid entry clearance in accordance with paragraph 57 of HC  395  and  as  a
student not as a visitor.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Cameroon, born on 5 February  1976.   His
    appeal against the decision of the  respondent,  made  on  5  September
    2007, whereby she refused his application for further leave  to  remain
    in the United Kingdom as a student, was  allowed  after  a  hearing  by
    Immigration Judge J S Law, in a determination promulgated on 26 October
    2007.  On 14 November 2007  Senior  Immigration  Judge  Jordan  ordered
    reconsideration for the following reasons:

      "1.   I think the issue is whether the appellant was last admitted  to
           the United Kingdom with a valid entry  clearance  in  accordance
           with paragraphs 57 to 75M or paragraphs 82 to 87F.
        2. By allowing the appeal, the Immigration Judge  must  have  found
           that he had last been given entry clearance  under  one  of  the
           paragraphs referred to above but he failed to identify which one
           it was.  Absent clear findings on this  issue,  the  immigration
           Judge appears to have made an error of law.
        3. It will be for the appellant to  establish  which  part  of  the
           immigration  rules,  the  appellant  was  last  admitted.    The
           appellant says he was  admitted  under  paragraph  57  but  what
           evidence  was  there  before  the  immigration  judge  that  the
           requirements (which requirements?) Were met? "


 2. Paragraph 60 of HC 395 as at the date of the decision read as follows:


           "The requirements for an extension of stay as a student are that
           the applicant:


           (i)(a) was last admitted to the United Kingdom in possession  of
           a valid student entry clearance   in accordance with  paragraphs
           57-62 or valid prospective student entry clearance in accordance
           with paragraphs 82-87 of these Rules; or

           (b) has previously been granted leave to enter or remain in  the
           United Kingdom to  re-sit  an  examination  in  accordance  with
           paragraphs 69A-69F of these Rules; or

           (c) if he has been accepted on a course of study at degree level
           or above, has previously been granted leave to enter  or  remain
           in the United Kingdom in accordance with paragraphs 87A-87F, 128-
           135, 135O-135T and 143A-143F of these Rules; or

           (d) has valid leave as a student in accordance  with  paragraphs
           57-62 of these Rules; and.

           (ii) meets the requirements for admission as a student  set  out
           in paragraph 57 (i) - (vi); and


           (iii) has produced evidence of his enrolment on a  course  which
           meets the requirements of paragraph 57; and


           (iv) can produce satisfactory  evidence  of  regular  attendance
           during any course which he  has  already  begun;  or  any  other
           course for which he has been enrolled in the past; and


           (v) can show evidence of satisfactory progress in his course  of
           study  including  the  taking  and  passing  of   any   relevant
           examinations; and


           (vi) would not, as a result of an extension of stay, spend  more
           than 2 years on short courses below degree level (ie courses  of
           less than 1 years duration, or longer courses broken off  before
           completion); and


           (vii) has not come to the end  of  a  period  of  government  or
           international scholarship agency sponsorship, or has the written
           consent of his official sponsor for a further period of study in
           the United Kingdom and  satisfactory  evidence  that  sufficient
           sponsorship funding is available."




 3. The notice of immigration decision dated 5 September 2007  stated  that
    in view of the fact that the appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on
    2 July 2007 with entry clearance as a  short-term  student  subject  to
    code conditions prohibiting work  or  recourse  to  public  funds,  the
    Secretary of State was not satisfied that he was last admitted  to  the
    United Kingdom in possession of a valid entry clearance  in  accordance
    with paragraph 57-75M or 82-87F of the immigration  rules  or  that  he
    fell within any of the relevant exemptions  from  the  requirements  to
    have been admitted with entry clearance in paragraph 60(i).  The notice
    of decision stated that the application was being refused  because  the
    appellant did not have a particular immigration document with reference
    to section 88(2)(b) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
    and therefore his right to appeal was limited by operation  of  section
    88 of the Act

 4. In paragraph 6 of his determination the immigration judge recorded that
    the  representative  for  the  appellant  submitted  that  the  grounds
    relating to the refusal were exactly the same as the grounds  that  the
    appellant did not have an appealable right following the refusal by the
    respondent.  He said it was stated that the appellant  arrived  in  the
    United Kingdom with a valid visa for a short term student  which  would
    expire on the 2 December 2007.  The  appellant  attended  a  recognised
    place of study being the A-Z School of English in  Manchester  and  his
    studies had commenced on 16 July 2007 to finalise on 16 July 2008.  The
    original visa was for eleven weeks but it was recognised that he needed
    more English and therefore the appellant telephoned the Home Office  to
    see whether it was possible to extend the  student  visa  in  order  to
    improve his English language.  The immigration judge recorded that as a
    result of advice  he  received  from  the  Home  Office  the  appellant
    submitted an application  form  which  was  acknowledged  by  the  Home
    Office.  The immigration judge observed that  the  appellant  paid  the
    total amount of the fees of ï¿½1,980 on the basis that  at  the  time  of
    making his application for leave to extend  he  had  a  valid  document
    namely a limited visa to 2 September 2007.

 5. Thereafter the immigration judge appears to have proceeded on the basis
    of a mistake induced by the appellant's representative which  was  that
    it was the fault of the respondent that  the  appellant  did  not  have
    valid leave at the  date  of  the  decision  since  the  delay  by  the
    respondent meant that the application was  determined  on  5  September
    2007 which was  after  the  visa  expired  on  2  September  2007.   In
    paragraph  9  of  his  determination  immigration   judge   said   this
    [infelicities in original]:

      "A decision therefore had to be made as to whether at the time of  the
      decision did the Appellant have a valid document.  At law  the  answer
      and within the Immigration Rules he did not as this had expired  three
      days before the decision.  However this appeared to be  highly  unjust
      as the Respondent's delay had caused the generation of  the  basis  of
      their refusal. If a decision had been made prior to 2nd September then
      it would be unable to be refused. I find therefore that the Respondent
      had not acted well within the Immigration Rules  and  that  discretion
      should have been exercised in favour  of  the  Appellant  in  allowing
      leave as at the time of his application  and  at  all  material  times
      thereafter he was the possessor of a valid visa which entitled him  to
      remain in the United Kingdom for the purposes  of  his  study  of  the
      English  language.   I  find  that  he  complied  with  the  necessary
      requirements and had completed applications which  were  specified  by
      the Home Office Department in Liverpool and that he  should  therefore
      be allowed this appeal".


      The immigration judge clearly failed to have regard to section  3C  of
    the Immigration Act 1971 by virtue of which the appellant's  leave  was
    extended pending the determination of his application.

6.    The appellant's representative and the immigration judge  perhaps  may
    be forgiven for the mistake that they made because the  respondent  was
    not represented at the hearing and therefore they had  to  rely  solely
    upon the notice of immigration decision to know the  basis  upon  which
    the application had been refused. The grounds for review revealed  more
    fully the basis of the refusal of  the  appellant's  application.   The
    grounds asserted that the appellant came to  United  Kingdom  to  be  a
    short-term student on 2 July 2007 and he  was  granted  leave  until  2
    September 2007.  For immigration purposes a short-term student was  one
    who was coming to the United Kingdom to undertake a course of study  of
    6 months duration or less.  It was  asserted  that  the  appellant  was
    given entry clearance prohibiting work or recourse to public funds, due
    to the brevity of the course, and subsequently was deemed to have  been
    given leave as a visitor.  Prior to  1  September  2007  visitors  were
    permitted to undertake a short course of study  within  the  period  of
    their  leave.   It  was  asserted  that  the  appellant  then  made  an
    application to extend his permission to remain in the United Kingdom as
    a student as he had embarked on another course of study  which  was  to
    expire on 16 July 2008.  This was refused on 5 September  2007  on  the
    basis that the appellant did  not  possess  valid  entry  clearance  in
    accordance with paragraphs 57-75M or 82-87F.  The grounds  went  on  to
    assert that in order to have been given a student  entry  clearance  in
    accordance with paragraph 57 the appellant would have had to have  been
    given a code which prohibited employment, except part-time or  vacation
    work with the consent of the Secretary of  State  as  provided  for  by
    paragraph 58 (they meant 57) of the immigration rules.

 7. It is difficult to see  how  the  claim  by  the  respondent  that  the
    appellant had entry clearance as a visitor could be maintained  in  the
    light of the fact that the entry clearance endorsed on the  appellant's
    passport showed that the entry clearance was as a "short term student".
     The assertion that the appellant was prohibited from working or having
    recourse to public funds is countered by the fact that as a visitor  he
    would have had to satisfy the entry clearance officer that he  intended
    to leave the United Kingdom at the end of the period of his visit.  The
    application for an extension of leave shows that the appellant proposed
    to undertake a further course of study in the United Kingdom, namely an
    engineering course at the Manchester  Metropolitan  University.  It  is
    difficult to see how an entry  clearance  officer  would  have  granted
    leave to the appellant as a visitor when he knew that  the  purpose  of
    the application was so that the appellant could  study  in  the  United
    Kingdom and expect him to  have  the  intention  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom after 11 weeks.

 8.  The  answer  is  put  beyond  any  doubt  whatsoever,  however,  by  a
    consideration of the respondent's IDIs. At the reconsideration  hearing
    the appellant's representative  produced  a  copy  of  IDIs  Chapter  3
    Section 1 dated August 2007. It  was  clear,  however,  that  this  was
    drafted in anticipation of a change in the immigration  rules  to  take
    effect on 1 September  2007.  With  the  representatives'  agreement  I
    indicated that I would look at the IDIs which were in force at the date
    the appellant was granted entry clearance.  The IDIs Chapter 3  Section
    1 dated March 2006 contain relevant provisions:

      "1.1 Entry Clearance

      Those nationals who are specified in Appendix  1  to  the  Immigration
      Rules require prior entry clearance as a student  before  arriving  in
      the United Kingdom. From 13 November 2005 all non-visa nationals  with
      the exception of those listed below require prior entry  clearance  if
      they wish to study in the United Kingdom for more than six months.
      ...


      Non visa nationals seeking leave to enter to study for less  than  six
      months do not need prior entry clearance, but will only be granted  up
      to a maximum  of  six  months  on  arrival,  subject  to  meeting  the
      requirements of the student Rules. However they may  choose  to  apply
      for entry clearance where they  have,  for  example,  previously  been
      refused entry.
      ...
      1.2.2.1 Short Term Students - Visitor Conditions Code 5N - Code 3

      Short term students, on courses of six months or less, and who make it
      clear to the Immigration Officer that that they do not  wish  to  take
      part-time employment may be  routinely  granted  code  5N  or  code  3
      visitor conditions at the  port  of  entry  (subject  to  meeting  the
      requirements of paragraph 57 and provided none of the general  grounds
      of refusal set out in Part 9 of HC395 applies).

      1.2.2.2 Short Term Students - Student Conditions Code 2

      Short term students, on courses of 6 months or less, who  do  indicate
      that they wish to take part-time employment, should be  granted  leave
      to enter on code 2 student conditions for the duration of  the  course
      up to a maximum of 6 months (subject to meeting  the  requirements  of
      paragraph 57 and provided none of the general grounds of  refusal  set
      out in Part 9 of HC 395 applies)."

 9. The IDIs make it perfectly plain that at the  time  the  appellant  was
    granted entry clearance a short-term student who did not wish  to  take
    part-time  employment  would  be  granted  leave  subject  to   visitor
    conditions provided that he was able to comply with the requirements of
    paragraph 57 of HC 395.  In  these  circumstances  the  fact  that  the
    appellant's entry clearance contained the words "no work or recourse to
    public funds" is not an indication that he had not been  granted  entry
    clearance at a short-term student in accordance with  paragraph  57  HC
    395.


10.   The appellant's entry  clearance,  by  virtue  of  article  2  of  the
    Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000  (as  amended),  had
    effect as leave to enter the United Kingdom and by virtue of article  5
    subject to any conditions to which entry clearance  was  subject  which
    were endorsed on it.


11. I am satisfied that at the date of the decision the appellant was  last
    admitted to the United Kingdom in possession of a valid entry clearance
    in accordance with paragraph 57  of  HC  395  and  that  therefore  the
    decision of the respondent was not in accordance with  the  immigration
    rules.  In these circumstances although the immigration judge  made  an
    error of law in relation to  the  reasons  for  his  finding  that  the
    appellant had valid entry  clearance  at  the  date  of  the  decision,
    nonetheless for different reasons, his conclusion was a correct one.

  12. In paragraph 8 of his determination the immigration judge said this:

      "Evidence was made available  that  the  Appellant  had  been  a  good
      student and had attended on an extremely regular basis at his place of
      study.  Further that he discharged the cost of  the  course  and  that
      there  were  no  inherent  possible  objections  on  the  grounds   of
      accommodation and maintenance as his Sponsor remained the same and  he
      had completed a period of study without falling  on  public  funds  or
      employment."


13. The finding of the immigration judge that the appellant  complied  with
    the remaining requirements of the  rules  was  not  challenged  in  the
    grounds for review and the order for reconsideration was limited to the
    decision of the immigration judge as to whether the appellant  had  the
    necessary entry clearance.   Therefore it follows that the  immigration
    judge did not make  a  material  error  of  law  in  his  determination
    allowing the appeal and his determination shall stand.
