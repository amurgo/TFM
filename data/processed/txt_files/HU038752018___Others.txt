For the Appellants:    Mr A Mackenzie, counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms S Cunha, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The  Appellants,  nationals  of  Turkey,  appealed  against  the  ECO's
    decisions, dated 4 January  2018,  to  refuse  applications  for  entry
    clearance made on 9 October 2017.

2.   Their appeals came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  K  R  Moore  (the
    Judge) who on 2 January 2019  dismissed  [D]  their  appeals  on  human
    rights grounds with reference to Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE of  the
    Immigration Rules.

3.   The Entry Clearance  Officer,  for  reasons  given,  had  rejected  the
    sufficiency of the evidence concerning the IQ/abilities  of  the  First
    Appellant, with its  consequential  effects  on  her  English  language
    abilities, and with reference to the Sponsor meeting the minimum income
    requirements.

4.   The Judge set  out,  seemingly  under  a  mistake  of  fact,  that  the
    relevant psychiatric evidence concerning the First Appellant originated
    in August 2014 whereas in fact it was 29 May 2017.  The Judge also,  it
    was accepted, seemed to have been  labouring  under  a  misapprehension
    that it was a requirement under the Rules for the  First  Appellant  to
    provide a completed "exemption  form"  from  a  doctor  confirming  the
    mental or  physical  condition  of  the  First  Appellant.   The  Judge
    misunderstood that position.  To that extent, bearing in mind the First
    Appellant had, when making the application, identified a mental  health
    issue  as  to  her  ability  to  comply  with  the   English   language
    requirements, was a point that in  fact  was  not  really  to  be  held
    generally against the First, Second or Third Appellants.

5.   The Judge went  on  to  consider  what  he  thought  was  the  relevant
    evidence, particularly as to whether the Appellants had, as at the date
    of the ECO's decision, met the relevant minimum income requirements.  I
    was taken to evidence, before the Judge, which appeared to show  really
    without contradiction that the Sponsor did meet the relevant  financial
    requirements at the material time.

6.   Nevertheless, the Judge went on to set out the basis on  which  he  was
    entitled, or believed himself entitled, to take into account the  issue
    of the minimum income requirements and the impact of  the  requirements
    of Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules.  Regrettably it  seemed  to
    me the Judge was either misled or misled himself as to the relationship
    that existed in a human rights based appeal with the Rules  being  met,
    or not, at material date of application/date of the decision.

7.   Be that as it may the Judge went on to  essentially  constrain  himself
    from considering material evidence which plainly  bore  on  the  public
    interest question and if absence of compliance  with  the  Rules  to  a
    material degree affected the extent to which the Judge was entitled  to
    take into account the factual position as at the  date  the  Judge  was
    making his decision.

8.   I accept the arguments raised on behalf  of  the  Appellants  that  the
    Judge did not assess this matter in the context of  the  Supreme  Court
    case law of Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11 and MM (Lebanon) [2017] UKSC 10.   I
    concluded that in fact when looking at the Article 8 ECHR issue in  the
    context  of  the  Immigration  Rules  that  MM  is  of  assistance   in
    understanding to what extent, even assuming  as  a  fact  it  occurred,
    there was a failure to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Rules.   More
    importantly also the issue of the public interest and the  weight  that
    will be given to that in the context of the degree to which there is or
    is not non-compliance with  the  Rules,  as  material  in  the  overall
    assessment of proportionality.

9.      In the circumstances I concluded that  the  Judge  did  err  in  law
    because he had failed to properly apply the wider considerations  which
    bear upon the issue as reflected both in the case of MM  (Lebanon)  and
    to a degree in the case of SS (Congo) [2017] UKSC.

10.  In the circumstances I  find  that  the  Original  Tribunal's  decision
    cannot stand and the matter will have to be remade. The parties invited
    me to do so.

11.  I proceed to consider this matter  in  the  context  of  the  cases  of
    Hesham Ali [2016] UKSC 60 and Agyarko [2017] UKSC  11  as  well  as  MM
    (Lebanon) [2017] UKSC 10.  I take into account  that  contrary  to  the
    Secretary of State's usual position there  was  no  high  threshold  or
    otherwise to decide whether or not Article 8 can be looked  at  outside
    of the Rules.  However, I looked at Article 8 through the prism of  the
    Rules.  I consider the approach identified in  Agyarko  as  helpful  to
    look at the pros and cons of the particular circumstances of the  case.
    I apply Section 117A and Section 117B  of  the  NIAA  2002  as  amended
    attaching as I do significant importance to the public interest.

12.  Material of course to the assessment of the  public  interest  was  the
    extent to which Appellants are potentially able to integrate  and  form
    part of UK society as well as the extent to which they may or  may  not
    be a financial  burden  upon  society.   In  assessing  that  matter  I
    consider, since I look at this matter as of now, the relevant  position
    vis-�-vis the ability to support themselves, or be supported  by  their
    Sponsor father, and the extent to which they might fall to be a  burden
    on the public purse.

13.  So far as that is concerned I find from the evidence  which  the  Judge
    had, which I have been taken to, and the way the  Judge  expressed  it,
    that the Appellants' Sponsor meets the necessary financial threshold of
    �24,800.  In fact, as last evidenced, he had an income of about �26,400
    as demonstrated by pay slips that formed part of the Appellants' bundle
    before the Judge.  I also noted that the Judge did not expressly  demur
    from the reliability of  that  documentation  but  the  extent  it  was
    discounted was driven by the Judge's view of the material date at which
    matters should be in evidence and established.  The was no  substantive
    dispute about the Sponsor's earnings on  the  evidence  that  had  been
    provided.

14.  I also consider that there was no  evidence  to  show  that  the  First
    Appellant cannot integrate into UK life and cannot form a  part  caring
    for the Second and Third Appellants in conjunction with the Sponsor.  I
    bear in mind the First Appellant has had that burden of caring for  the
    Second and Third Appellants for  a  significant  period  on  any  view.
    There was no suggestion that her  coming  to  the  United  Kingdom  was
    transferring a  burden  to  the  public  purse  from  costs  that  fell
    previously upon the Turkish state or that there was any sensible reason
    why there was likely to be an increase in burden upon the taxpayer.

15.  I consider in my assessment of the pros and  cons  the  fact  that  the
    Sponsor has been in the United Kingdom  for  a  significant  period  of
    years, has worked and supported his family, as well as  being  able  to
    return and see his family and maintain familial contact.  The fact that
    he could do it or continue to do that from abroad was really no  answer
    to the point clearly in terms of the objectives of Article  8  ECHR  to
    enable the exercise family/private life rights.   The  significance  of
    direct contact and the best interests of the  children  plainly  was  a
    relevant matter.  It seemed to me that whilst the Judge concluded  that
    the best interests of the children remain being with their  mother,  he
    had failed to address the potential benefits,  within  the  objects  of
    Article 8, of reuniting families and  enabling  that  kind  of  control
    which can be exercised by parents in direct daily  contact  with  their
    children; rather than simply through holiday  visits,  Skype  or  other
    electronic means.  I found the view that there were  positive  benefits
    to the Second and Third Appellants of being reunited  as  a  family  in
    daily contact with mother and Sponsor.

16.  There was nothing to suggest  that  the  Second  and  Third  Appellants
    would not be able to integrate into life in the United Kingdom and that
    for some reason or other there  would  be  any  wish  to  prevent  that
    integration.  What was clear was that since the Sponsor has come to the
    United Kingdom he has undoubtedly participated in life  in  the  United
    Kingdom as well as supporting his family from abroad.

17.  For these reasons I conclude in this case that the public interest  was
    outweighed and in  doing  so  I  particularly  take  into  account  the
    objective of immigration control through the prism of the  Rules.   The
    reality was that this appeal could well have succeeded  at  an  earlier
    time and that the continued prevention of the Appellants from  entering
    the United Kingdom was not in their best interests nor did it evidently
    serve purposes that might fall within Article 8(2) of the ECHR.  I find
    the ECO's decision did not demonstrate an  assessment  which  reflected
    the realities of the factual circumstances that were  before  him.   In
    coming  to  that  conclusion,  I  take  into   account   the   material
    consideration which was identified in MM  (Lebanon)  in  terms  of  the
    weight that might be given to policy reasons raised by the Secretary of
    State now as opposed to the complications  caused  by  the  significant
    interference in the resumption of family life in its true  sense.   For
    these reasons, I find that the evidence before  the  Judge  and  as  it
    stands before me was sufficient to show that the correct  decision  was
    that the appeals of the Appellants should be allowed. under  Article  8
    ECHR.

DECISION

18.  The appeal of each Appellant is allowed on Article 8 ECHR grounds

ANONYMITY

19.  Given the age of the Second and Third Appellants I  find  an  anonymity
    order was appropriate and necessary.

DIRECTION REGARDING ANONYMITY - RULE 14 OF  THE  TRIBUNAL  PROCEDURE  (UPPER
TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Fees of �140 were paid by each Appellant.  Their appeals have succeeded  and
I conclude that a fee award in respect of each Appellant in the sum of  �140
should be made.
