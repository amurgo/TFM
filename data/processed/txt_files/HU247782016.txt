                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a citizen of Nigeria who was  born  on  31  March  1988,
    appeals against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  S  Meah)
    dismissing the appellant's appeal under Art 8 of  the  ECHR  against  a
    decision of the Secretary of State dated 19 October  2016  refusing  is
    application for Indefinite Leave to Remain ("ILR") under para  276B  of
    the Immigration Rules (HC 395 (as amended)).





Background

 2. The appellant entered the United Kingdom  on  23  September  2006  with
    entry clearance as a student valid until 31 August 2007.  On 30  August
    2007,  he  applied  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  student  which   was
    subsequently granted until 31 October 2010.  The appellant's leave then
    expired.

 3. On 5 January 2011, the appellant applied for leave to remain as a  Tier
    4 (General) Student which was granted on  10  February  2011  until  15
    October 2012.

 4. On 13 October 2012, the appellant applied for further leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 4 (General) Student which was granted until 1 February 2015.

 5. On 8 October 2014, however, the appellant's leave was  curtailed  until
    12 December 2014.

 6. On 12 December 2014, the appellant  made  an  in-time  application  for
    further leave to remain based upon Art 8.  This application was refused
    on 31 March 2015.

 7. On 10 April 2015, the appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and
    that appeal was dismissed on 4 April  2016.   On  18  April  2016,  the
    appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  but
    permission was refused by the First-tier Tribunal on  6  October  2016.
    The appellant did not, thereafter, renew his application to  the  Upper
    Tribunal and he became appeal rights exhausted, as a consequence, on 20
    October 2016.

 8. However, on 12 October 2016, the appellant made the application for ILR
    based  upon  ten  years'  lawful  residence  under  para  276B  of  the
    Immigration Rules which is the subject of  this  appeal  following  the
    refusal of that application on 19 October 2016.

The Judge's Decision

 9. Before Judge Meah, it was accepted that the appellant could not succeed
    under para 276B.  He  could  not  establish  a  period  of  ten  years'
    continuous lawful residence since he entered the  UK  on  23  September
    2006.

10. That is, undoubtedly, correct and was common ground between the parties
    before us.  There is a 'gap' in the  appellant's  leave  following  the
    expiry of his leave as a student on 31 October 2010 and the  subsequent
    grant of leave to the appellant as a Tier  4  Student  on  10  February
    2011.  That gap, between 1 November 2010 and 10 February  2011  is  101
    days.  In his decision letter, the respondent stated that the  gap  was
    between 1 November 2010 and 5 January 2011 and was, therefore, a gap of
    66 days.  However, since the appellant was only granted leave,  on  the
    basis of that application, from 10 February 2011, the gap in his lawful
    residence extended to that latter date, there being  no  backdating  of
    the grant of leave to the date of application.

11. It was also common ground before  us  that  para  276B(v),  so  far  as
    relevant to this appeal, did not apply.  It would have allowed a period
    of overstaying to be "disregarded" if the appellant's application (made
    on 5 January 2011) had been made "within 28 days of the expiry of [his]
    leave".  Of course, it was not as his leave had expired on  31  October
    2010.

12. Before Judge Meah, relying  upon  Art  8  outside  the  Rules,  it  was
    contended on the appellant's behalf that in  assessing  proportionality
    it was  relevant  that  the  respondent  had  previously  condoned  the
    appellant's period  of  overstaying  by  granting  him  leave  from  10
    February 2011.  In particular, discretion had  been  exercised  in  his
    favour based upon his personal circumstances at that time, namely  that
    his grandfather  in  Nigeria  had  been  kidnapped  and  murdered  with
    consequent impact upon the appellant.

13. The judge dealt with this argument and rejected it at  paras  29-33  of
    his decision as follows:

         "29. Mr Hussain made much of a  previous  grant  of  leave  to  the
             appellant by the respondent from 10  February  2011  until  15
             October 2012.  This was granted to him despite  him  being  an
             overstayer at the time of that application by over  2  months.
             The appellant had stated that his grandfather in  Nigeria,  to
             whom he was very close, had been kidnapped and murdered around
             that time and  this  affected  him  causing  him  stress,  and
             resulted in him not doing well in his exams.

         30.  This was put to the respondent  in  that  application,  and  a
             subject access request  by  those  acting  for  the  appellant
             revealed that this was considered by the respondent  when  she
             decided to grant that leave  to  the  appellant.   It  appears
             discretion was exercised in the  appellant's  favour,  despite
             him having overstayed by over two months by the time  of  that
             application, when his leave  was  granted  to  him,  which  Mr
             Hossain stated should be considered when assessing  the  break
             in the lawful leave for the purposes of the  application  made
             by the appellant under Rule 276B.  This was despite Mr Hossain
             already conceding that the Rules had not in fact been met.

         31.  I surmised that what he meant was that this should be a factor
             to be considered in the wider  assessment  of  proportionality
             rather than it being a submission to support a contention that
             the Rules were satisfied, which they clearly were not in  this
             instance.

         32.   Accordingly,  in  considering  this  in  the  context  of  my
             consideration  of  the  appellant's  claim  under  the   wider
             jurisprudential assessment being carried out here,  I  do  not
             find the fact  the  appellant  previously  benefited  from  an
             exercise of discretion by the respondent in his favour when he
             was granted, that  leave,  creates  some  kind  of  legitimate
             expectation  that  discretion  should  therefore   have   been
             exercised when the  appellant's  Indefinite  Leave  to  Remain
             application  was  considered  over  5.5   years   later,   and
             specifically that that discretion  should  have  entailed  the
             respondent disregarding the fact  that  he  had  a  major  gap
             exceeding 28 days breaking his lawful continuous leave for the
             purposes of Rule 276B(v).

         33.  I find no merit in this line of contention whatsoever  despite
             Mr Hossain seemingly being at pains to persuade me that  there
             was merit in that which he was attempting to advance on behalf
             of the appellant.  In other words, just because discretion was
             exercised previously based on  what  appear  to  have  been  a
             particular set of circumstances does  not  give  rise  to  any
             expectation that a similar discretion will be exercised in the
             future, over 5 years later, in an application which  is  being
             made on an entirely different premise."

14. The judge went on to find that the appellant could not  establish  that
    there were "very significant obstacles" to his integration  in  Nigeria
    under para 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules or that  his  removal
    would be a disproportionate interference with his  private  and  family
    life.

15. Accordingly, he dismissed the appellant's appeal.

Discussion

16. In his skeleton argument and oral submissions, Mr Richardson on  behalf
    of the appellant  raised  a  number  of  points  which,  he  submitted,
    demonstrated that  the  judge  had  erred  in  law  in  dismissing  the
    appellant's appeal under Art 8 outside the Rules.  He accepted that the
    appellant could not succeed under para 276B in establishing  10  years'
    continuous lawful residence and he did not  suggest  that  the  judge's
    adverse finding in respect of para 276ADE(1)(vi) was flawed.

17. Instead, Mr Richardson relied upon the fact that the Secretary of State
    had, in his submission, condoned the appellant's period of  overstaying
    between 1 November 2010 and 10 February 2011 when granting him leave to
    remain as a Tier 4 Student on 10 February 2011.   He  relied  upon  the
    GCID Case Records, obtained by the appellant as a result of  a  Subject
    Access Request, which noted:

         "APS grandfather had been kidnapped and murdered  last  year  which
         caused a lot of stress and meant AP did  not  do  as  well  in  the
         exams.  He has appealed to UNIV and is now continuing the course".

18. Mr Richardson sought to rely upon guidance  (valid  from  28  September
    2012)  ("applications  from  overstayers  (non-family  routes)")  which
    permitted discretion to be  exercised  in  "exceptional  circumstances"
    even  where  the  period  of  overstaying  exceeded  28  days  and   no
    application had been made for further  leave  (which  was  subsequently
    granted) within that time.  Mr Richardson acknowledged that this policy
    post-dated the grant of leave to the appellant on 10 February 2011 but,
    he submitted, he was unable to find the  relevant  archive  policy  for
    that date but it was reasonable to presume it  existed.   He  submitted
    that the  terms  of  that  policy  reflected  the  respondent's  policy
    applicable to the appellant in assessing  his  "long  residence"  claim
    which also allowed for a period of more than 28 days overstaying to  be
    condoned in "exceptional circumstances".  The  former  policy  referred
    to: "serious illness (supported by appropriate medical documentation)".
     The latter policy  referred  to:  "serious  illness  which  meant  the
    applicant  or  their  representative  was  not  able  to   submit   the
    application in time - this must be  supported  by  appropriate  medical
    documentation".

19. Mr Richardson submitted that neither the respondent nor the judge  took
    into account the "exceptional  circumstances"  which  had  led  to  the
    respondent granting the appellant leave on 10 February 2011 despite his
    period of overstaying when assessing whether, outside the Rules, it was
    established that his removal  was  not  proportionate.   Mr  Richardson
    relied upon the decision in SF and  Others  (guidance,  post-2014  Act)
    Albania [2017] UKUT 00120 (IAC) for  the  proposition  that  consistent
    compliance with guidance was relevant in a human rights claim (see [10]-
    [12]).

20. We do not accept Mr Richardson's submissions for a number of reasons.

21. First, as we pointed out to Mr Richardson  during  the  course  of  his
    submissions, the premise upon which they  are  based  is  flawed.   The
    policy upon which  he  placed  reliance  as  the  basis  on  which  the
    Secretary of State "condoned" the 101 days of overstaying in  2010/2011
    post-dates the grant of leave to the appellant  on  10  February  2011.
    There is no reason  to  believe  that  that  policy  existed,  and  was
    applied, in February 2011.  Indeed, there is every reason to believe no
    such policy existed at the time of the decision in February 2011.

22. At that time, the relevant Tier 4 (General) Student  rule  relevant  to
    the grant of leave to remain was found in para  245ZX.   That  did  not
    require an applicant to have existing leave  and,  therefore,  did  not
    exclude a grant of leave to a person who was an overstayer.  There  was
    no equivalent of para 245ZX(m) which was inserted from 1  October  2012
    by HC 194.  That provided, and still today provides:

         "the applicant must not be in the UK in breach of immigration  laws
         except that any period of overstaying for a period of  28  days  or
         less will be disregarded".

    There was, therefore, no need for a policy in February 2011 which dealt
    explicitly  with  overstayers  and,  in  particular,  those   who   had
    overstayed in excess of 28 days.

23. Mr Richardson was unable to identify the terms of any  such  policy  in
    force in February 2011 and, in our judgment, the  reason  for  that  is
    that none existed.  The respondent's decision in February 2011 did not,
    therefore,  involve  the  exercise  of  discretion   to   condone   the
    applicant's period of overstaying since  1  November  2010:  there  was
    nothing requiring condonation for the purposes of the Rules.  At  best,
    the GCID records simply note the appellant's circumstances at the  time
    of that decision.  The judge cannot, therefore, be legally  faulted  in
    failing to  take  into  account  that  the  respondent  had  previously
    "condoned" the appellant's period of overstaying.

24. Secondly, even having regard to the respondent's  present  guidance  in
    dealing with long residence applications where there  is  a  period  in
    excess of 28 days overstaying, it does not appear that this policy  was
    raised before the judge.  The whole of the argument, in relation to the
    period of overstaying, focused on the importance  of  the  respondent's
    previous condonation of it.

25. Mr Richardson took us to the evidence that  was,  nevertheless,  before
    the judge in the appellant's  bundle  at  para  7  of  the  appellant's
    witness statement (page 20),  and  at  pages  30-44  attesting  to  his
    grandfather's death.  In particular, he referred us to a letter from Dr
    Okocha, a consultant psychiatrist dated 25 September 2012 which  refers
    to a referral to him of the appellant on 18 September  2012  and  which
    notes that he

         "presented with symptoms of depressive illness that dates  back  to
         well over a year and appear to follow the murder of his grandfather
         with  whom  he  had  a  close  relationship.   The  depression  was
         characterised by  low  mood  and  tearfulness,  loss  of  appetite,
         anergia, poor concentration and social  withdrawal  and  isolation.
         There is no doubt that his study at University was affected by it".

26. As we have said, the appellant's legal representative did not rely upon
    this evidence before the judge as falling within the respondent's "long
    residence" policy to which  Mr  Richardson  has  referred  us.   It  is
    difficult, in those circumstances, to criticise the judge  for  failing
    to deal with it in a way which was not relied upon before him.  But, in
    any event, we do not consider that that evidence would,  taken  at  its
    highest, justify the condonation of  the  101  days  during  which  the
    appellant overstayed.

27. The respondent's policy, linking it to para 276B(v), relates  to  there
    being "exceptional circumstances" which prevented  the  applicant  from
    applying within the first 28 days of overstaying.   If  an  application
    was  made  within  the  first  28  days,  it  would,  of   course,   be
    "disregarded"  because  of  para  276B(v).    Here,   the   appellant's
    grandfather was kidnapped and murdered in May  2009.   The  appellant's
    leave expired on 31 October 2010, some  seventeen  months  later.   The
    evidence to which we have referred does not, in our judgment, warrant a
    conclusion that there were "exceptional circumstances" which  prevented
    him making an application for further leave before the end of  November
    2010. Even if the judge had, in Mr Richardson's words looked at  Art  8
    through "the prism of the policy", the evidence could not have led  him
    to conclude that there  were  "exceptional  circumstances"  to  warrant
    condoning the period of the appellant's overstaying.  It would not,  in
    our judgment, have led the judge to find that the  appellant's  removal
    was disproportionate.

28. In our judgment, the judge reached a wholly  sustainable  finding  that
    there was no basis upon which the appellant could succeed either  under
    para 276B or  para  276ADE(1)  and  that  there  was  anything  in  the
    appellant's  circumstances  which  were  sufficiently   compelling   to
    outweigh  the  public  interest  such  that  his   removal   would   be
    disproportionate.

Decision

29. For the above reasons, the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    dismiss the appellant's appeal did not involve the making of  an  error
    of law.  That decision stands.

30. Accordingly, the appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
