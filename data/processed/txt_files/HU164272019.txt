                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                       (BY AN ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER)
                                                                  Respondent
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The appellant was given permission to  appeal  on  grounds  asking  for  the
Decision and Reasons to be set aside and the appeal remitted to  the  First-
tier Tribunal for re-determination.

Directions were given with a  view  to  determining  the  appeal  without  a
hearing.

In a letter  dated  12  October  2020  the  Respondent  indicated  that  she
accepted that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law and  suggested  that  the
appeal be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be redetermined.

Several errors of law are alleged by the Appellant and are accepted  by  the
Respondent, particularly a failure to apply the correct legal test.

In the circumstances I see no benefit in giving a  detailed  explanation.  I
find that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law as agreed by the  Respondent.
I set aside its decision and I direct that the appeal  be  redetermined  the
First-tier Tribunal.



Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed to the extent that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal is set aside and I direct that the appeal be  redetermined  in  the
First-tier Tribunal by a different judge.
