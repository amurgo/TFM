                                                                    Claimant

Representation:

For the claimant: Mr D Sellwood, instructed by Cardinal Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This  is  the  appeal  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  against  the
    determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Harris promulgated  19.9.14,
    allowing the claimant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer, dated 10.7.13, to refuse her entry clearance to  the
    United Kingdom as the child  of  the  sponsoring  father,  pursuant  to
    paragraph 297(i)(d) of the Immigration  Rules.   The  Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 4.9.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Ransley  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    10.11.14.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 6.1.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Harris should be set aside.

 5. The grounds complain that the judge failed to give any or any  adequate
    reasons  for  making  findings  on  material   matters.   Specifically,
    complaint is made that the judge relied on the photocopy of  the  death
    certificate of the claimant's mother,  issued  in  2013  purporting  to
    confirm her death in 2008.

 6. In  granting  permission  to  appeal,  Judge  Ransley  considered  that
    although the judge claimed to have followed  the  guidance  in  Tanveer
    Ahmed  [2002]  UKAIT  439,"his  subsequent  assessment  regarding   the
    credibility of the copy death certificate  of  the  appellant's  mother
    would indicate otherwise. The respondent had  strongly  challenged  the
    appellant's credibility by reference to her 2009 application  and  2012
    application under para 297 when it  was  stated  that  the  mother  was
    alive. The judge's assessment of the copy death certificate, which  was
    challenged by the respondent, indicate that the judge might have failed
    to apply the Tanveer Ahmed guidance. The determination has  been  shown
    to involve arguable errors  of  law  that  may  have  made  a  material
    difference to the  outcome  of  the  appeal.  Permission  is  therefore
    granted."

 7. As a preliminary issue, Mr  Sellwood  stated  that  shortly  after  the
    hearing the 'original' of the death certificate had been  sent  to  the
    Tribunal by recorded delivery, for which he had the  receipt.  However,
    the document clearly did not reach the judge prior to the  promulgation
    of the decision. An examination of the case file showed  that  no  such
    document was present. Nor was there any confirmation of receipt of  the
    same. In the circumstances, the Tribunal is no  further  assisted  than
    was Judge Harris in the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing.

 8. It is clear from �9 through �14 of the decision that the judge did  not
    just rely on the death certificate. An explanation was recorded for why
    the two previous applications had suggested that the  mother  was  then
    alive but that it  was  only  clarified  in  2013,  after  the  refusal
    decision that she had died in 2008. The judge was  thus  not  satisfied
    that these earlier applications undermined the claimant's  credibility.
    Neither was the judge persuaded at �10 that making  a  new  application
    rather than awaiting the outcome of an appeal against the 2012  refusal
    decision undermined the claimant's credibility.

 9. At �11 the judge explained that hearing oral evidence from the sponsor,
    whom the judge found entirely  credible,  assisted  the  judge  in  the
    weight to be attached to the documentary evidence adduced on behalf  of
    the claimant. Thus, at  �12,  the  judge  did  not  consider  that  the
    production of a copy  rather  than  the  original  was  necessarily  an
    obstacle to reliance on the document.

10. At �14 the judge noted that the certificate was not issued close to the
    alleged date of death of the mother stating, "I accept that in  Nigeria
    it cannot be assumed that a  death  certificate  will  only  be  issued
    immediately around the date of death." Whilst there was  no  expert  or
    objective evidence to support that assumption, it  is  clear  that  the
    judge found the sponsor's explanation for the delay  in  obtaining  the
    death certificate credible.

11. It follows that the judge took account of all the evidence in the round
    and assessed the weight to be accorded to the copy death certificate in
    the light of other evidence. I  do  not  accept  that  process  can  be
    regarded as perverse or one to which no judge properly  directed  could
    come. It was open to the judge to reach a view on the  certificate  and
    cogent reasons have been given for doing so.

12. Mr Duffy raised some concerns about maintenance  issues,  but  accepted
    that was not raised in the grounds of  application  for  permission  to
    appeal and no application was made to amend those grounds.

13. In the circumstances, and for the reasons set out herein, I reject  the
    submission that there was inadequate  evidence,  or  more  particularly
    inadequate reasoning supporting the conclusion  on  the  issue  of  the
    mother's death. It follows that I find  no  merit  in  the  grounds  of
    appeal.

Conclusion & Decision:

14. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains allowed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make a whole fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been allowed.
