The case raises questions about the extent,  if  any,  to  which  a  non-EEA
national with family ties to EEA nationals residing here  can  invoke  their
free  movement  rights  in  arguing  that   her   own   removal   would   be
disproportionate in terms of Article 8.  The ambit of the  ECJ  judgment  in
Chen, and of its manifestation at paragraph 257C of the  Immigration  Rules,
is also considered, in the light of a contention  that  the  requirement  of
self-sufficiency is not absolute.  The case  is  being  reported  for  these
reasons.


                                DETERMINATION


1.  On 12th April 2005 a Senior Immigration Judge, on an application by  the
respondent  for  permission  to  appeal  to  the  IAT,  ordered   that   the
determination of an adjudicator, Miss P. Clough, promulgated on  14th  March
2005, be reconsidered by the AIT, which had replaced both the  IAT  and  the
IAA on 4th April this year.  (By virtue of rule 2  of  the  Procedure  Rules
2005, the terms 'appellant' and 'respondent' retain the referents  they  had
before the adjudicator.)  The case raises an interesting question about  the
extent, if any, to  which  a  non-EEA  national  with  family  ties  to  EEA
nationals residing here can invoke their free  movement  rights  in  arguing
that her own removal would be disproportionate in terms of Article  8.   The
ambit of the ECJ judgment in Chen, and of  its  manifestation  at  paragraph
257C of the Immigration Rules,  is  also  considered,  in  the  light  of  a
contention that the requirement of self-sufficiency is  not  absolute.   The
case is being reported for these reasons.

2.  It will be convenient to set  out  briefly  what  the  history  of  this
appeal is, before we turn to what actually  has  to  be  reconsidered.   The
appellant was born in Uganda on 17th September  1985,  and  her  account  is
that her mother, who was but one of several wives of her  father,  abandoned
her at an early age, and came to this country.   From  early  childhood  the
appellant was used by other relatives in Uganda as a  domestic  servant  and
childminder,  although  she  also  spent  some  time  at  boarding  schools.
However, in the year 2000, at the age of 15, the appellant was taken to  the
United Kingdom, where she rejoined her mother's household.

3.  Her circumstances, unfortunately, were no better than they had  been  in
Uganda.  The appellant was put to work as a domestic  servant  in  both  her
mother's and other people's households, and was physically  abused.   Things
came to a head in April 2003,  when  the  appellant  was  ejected  from  her
mother's house, and took an overdose of Paracetamol.  After three  weeks  as
an in-patient at St Clement's Hospital,  the  appellant  was  provided  with
accommodation by Newham Social Work Department.  Although the  appellant  is
now over 18, this support continues under  the  provisions  of  the  Leaving
Care Act 2000.  She has also been assisted since  April  2003  by  a  Social
Worker from the NSPCC.

4.  There was another period in July 2003 when  the  appellant  was  feeling
depressed and suicidal, and was re-admitted to St  Clement's  Hospital.   It
transpired that the appellant had not been included in an  application  made
by her mother to regularize her own and her other children's status  in  the
United Kingdom, so on the advice of the NSPCC the appellant  claimed  asylum
in March 2004.  Her problems had not prevented the appellant from forming  a
relationship some time in the year 2000 with a young  Italian  citizen,  who
had been living here with his family since 1983.  In April 2004 a  child  of
that relationship was born.  At this time, the claimant's partnerSignor  was
a full-time student, but in December 2004 he completed  his  education,  and
at the date of the hearing before the adjudicator in February 2005,  he  was
unemployed and in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance of �86 per fortnight.

5.  Meanwhile, the appellant's claim was refused in August 2004  under  both
the Refugee and Human Rights Conventions, and an  appeal  was  lodged  under
s.82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on  both  asylum
and human rights grounds.  Having heard evidence from a  Social  Worker  and
from the claimant's partner, and having considered statements by  two  other
Social Workers and by the appellant herself, the adjudicator  dismissed  the
appeal under the Refuge Convention and under Articles 2, 3  and  14  of  the
European Convention.  Her reasons are set out thus at paragraph  23  of  the
determination :
            "I do not find that the Appellant has proved  she  has  a  well-
      founded fear of persecution if returned to Uganda.  She  is  19  years
      old, and I accept the welfare organisations in Uganda outlined in  the
      Home Office's letter giving the reasons for refusal would be available
      to her if returned.  The Appellant also has  her  father  and  a  full
      brother in Uganda.  While she may have lost touch with them I  do  not
      consider it would be difficult for her  to  re-establish  contact.   I
      came to these conclusions  because  of  the  paucity  of  evidence  to
      support the Appellant's contention that she was trafficked from Uganda
      and prior to that was treated as a domestic helper from an earlier age
      for various families."

6.  However, the adjudicator went on to allow the  appeal  under  Article  8
and "EEA Law".  She found that the appellant's partner had been involved  in
caring for his son,  and  was  staying  for  three  nights  a  week  at  the
accommodation provided for the appellant by  Newham  Council.   Accordingly,
the appellant enjoyed family life with her partner  and  their  child.   "Mr
______," she continued at paragraph 26, "has no links with Uganda and  would
find it difficult to settle there.  Removing the appellant  would  obviously
disrupt their family life but it  would  be  in  accordance  with  the  UK's
immigration policy.  However, I  do  not  consider  such  removal  would  be
proportionate in the circumstances here, especially  having  regard  to  the
Appellant's accepted vulnerable status and the  oversight  of  her  and  her
child by the NSPCC and Newham Social Work Department.  To remove  her  would
be outside the range of any reasonable response in these circumstances."

7.  The phrase with which the adjudicator began her  next  paragraph  bulked
large in Miss Cronin's submissions to us :
      "In addition, it was argued that  the  Appellant's  appeal  should  be
considered by reference to Chen [now reported at [2004] Imm AR  333].   This
case decided that the enjoyment by a young child of a right of residence  in
a member state  necessarily  implies  that  the  child  is  entitled  to  be
accompanied by the person who is his or her  primary  carer  and  the  carer
must be in a position to reside with the child in the host Member State  for
the duration of such residence.  Article 18 EC and Directive 90/  364  grant
a right to reside for an indefinite period in the host  Member  State  to  a
young minor who is the national of another Member State.  They also allow  a
parent who is that minor's primary carer to reside with  the  child  in  the
host Member State."

8.  In the final paragraph of her determination, the adjudicator found  that
the appellant's child was an Italian national by  descent  from  his  father
and that, while both his parents were reliant on public finances,  that  was
not a situation which was likely to continue in the  long  term.   Both  the
child and his father were exercising Treaty rights in  the  United  Kingdom.
For her part, the appellant also had a right to reside here as  the  child's
primary carer, and the appeal was accordingly allowed  under  Article  8  of
the ECHR, under Article 18 of the consolidated EC Treaty, and under  Council
Directive 90/ 364.

9.  We may observe at this point that  the  Skeleton  Arguments  which  were
submitted to the adjudicator both by Miss Cronin  and  by  Mr  Johnson,  the
Presenting  Officer,  do  not  seem  to  have  been  read  with  very  close
attention, else paragraphs 27 and 28 of her determination would hardly  have
assumed the shape they did.   Nor,  it  seems,  was  Mr  Johnson's  Skeleton
Argument read by the Presenting Officer who drafted the  Grounds  of  Appeal
to the IAT, since he missed several points which a perusal of that  document
might have suggested to him.  Only three points were in fact  taken  in  the
Grounds of Appeal :
   1) In paragraph 26, the adjudicator did not explain how it was  that  the
      respondent's decision fell outwith the range of  reasonable  responses
      open to him.
   2) In the same paragraph, the adjudicator failed  to  explain  how  there
      came  to  be  "insurmountable  obstacles"  in  Mahmood  terms  to  the
      continuance of family life in Uganda.
   3) In paragraphs 27 and 28, the adjudicator did  not  adequately  explain
      how she came to regard the appellant as the  "primary  carer"  of  the
      child in terms of Chen, since the father  was  also  helping  to  look
      after the child.

10.  Before us,  Miss  Brown  very  sensibly  acknowledged  that  there  was
nothing in the third point.  That point too was not included in the  reasons
given by the Senior Immigration Judge for ordering  reconsideration.   Three
reasons were in fact given, but only one of them corresponded  to  a  Ground
of  Appeal.   This  was  the  point  about  the  appellant's  fianc�  facing
insurmountable  obstacles  to  joining  the  appellant   in   Uganda.    The
adjudicator's explanation at paragraph 26 that "he has no links with  Uganda
and would find it difficult to settle  there"  he  regarded  as  a  "plainly
insufficient reason".

11.  However, the SIJ's  other  two  reasons  went  beyond  the  Grounds  of
Appeal.  Referring to N, the SIJ  thought  it  arguable  "that  the  medical
evidence did not establish the appellant could not return  to  Uganda."   He
went on to regard it as plainly arguable "that the  appellant  should  apply
to exercise her Treaty rights and that the  Adjudicator  was  wrong  to  use
Article  8  as  a  substitute  for  a  proper  consideration  of   such   an
application."

12.  Before us Miss Brown acknowledged, again very sensibly, that these  two
reasons of the Senior Immigration Judge were barred from  our  consideration
by Miftari [2005] EWCA Civ 481, since they  had  not  been  pleaded  in  the
respondent's Grounds of Appeal.  Both representatives also agreed  that  the
adjudicator was in error by allowing the appeal under  European  law,  which
is what the Senior Immigration Judge may have been suggesting in  his  third
reason for ordering a reconsideration.  There had  been  no  application  by
the appellant for a  residence  permit  as  the  family  member  of  an  EEA
national, and hence no decision  under  the  EEA  Regulations  2000  against
which she could appeal.  Miss Cronin told us that  she  had  not  asked  the
adjudicator to allow the appeal under Article 18 EC and Directive  90/  364,
but only to make  findings  of  fact  (although  it  has  to  be  said  that
paragraphs  14  to  20  of  Miss  Cronin's  Skeleton  Argument  before   the
adjudicator deal with 'The EEA Provisions',  and  end  with  the  submission
that "this appeal should be allowed  as  the  removal  decision  is  not  in
accordance with directly applicable EEA law").

13.  It turns out, therefore, that we have no jurisdiction to  consider  the
direct application of European law to this case, and that  we  are  confined
to the first two Grounds of Appeal - as we would have been in any event,  on
the Miftari principle - which are concerned solely with Article 8.   It  was
also agreed before us that the  appellant's  partner  is  exercising  Treaty
rights in the UK, and that the appellant's child is Italian by descent  from
him (Italian nationality law no longer requiring legitimacy).   Finally,  it
was clarified for us that the history recounted by the appellant was not  in
dispute.

14.  The representatives having thus helpfully narrowed the issues  for  us,
their submissions took the following course.  Miss Brown argued that it  was
inconsistent of the adjudicator to find at paragraph 23 that  the  appellant
could obtain the assistance of welfare organisations  in  Uganda  and  could
also re-establish contact with her father and full brother  there,  so  that
Article  3  was  not  engaged,  while  finding  at  paragraph  26  that  her
"vulnerable status and the oversight of her and her child by the  NSPCC  and
Newham Social Work Department" would put her removal "outside the  range  of
any reasonable response."

15.  Miss Brown observed that the  Court  of  Appeal  had  handed  down  its
judgment in Huang on 1st March 2005, while Miss Clough did not sign off  her
determination till 9th March.  But whether the test in  M*(Croatia)  or  the
"truly exceptional" test in Huang were applied, the adjudicator was  clearly
wrong to find removal disproportionate.  As  the  Senior  Immigration  Judge
had stated, the appellant's partner's  absence  of  links  with  Uganda  was
plainly not an insuperable obstacle to his relocating  to  that  country  to
continue family life there.

16.  Miss Brown also contended that the appellant could  not  bring  herself
within the ambit of the ECJ judgment in Chen, as her colleague, Mr  Johnson,
had explained in his Skeleton Argument.  Miss Cronin,  on  the  other  hand,
insisted that she could, and that this was very relevant to  the  assessment
of proportionality, even though the appellant could not rely  directly  upon
European law.   Insofar  as  her  removal  would  interfere  with  the  free
movement rights of her son and her fianc�, who were  EEA  nationals,  rights
under European law did form part of the assessment of  proportionality,  and
it could be inferred from the  ECJ's  recent  decisions  that  EU  nationals
should never be placed in a position where they had to  choose  between  the
exercise of Community law rights and the right to family life, as  protected
by Article 8.   Thus,  rather  than  needing  to  show  "truly  exceptional"
circumstances in terms of Huang,  the  balance  in  an  EEA  case  like  the
appellant's was somewhat different, and turned on the disproportion  of  the
restriction on free movement.

17.  In Miss Cronin's view, the  adjudicator's  consideration  of  Chen  and
European law at  paragraph  27  of  her  determination  was  linked  to  her
consideration of Article 8 at paragraph  26  by  the  phrase  "in  addition"
coming at the start of paragraph 27.  This showed that  the  EC  law  points
were matters to which the adjudicator had regard in her  overall  assessment
of  proportionality.   To  Miss  Brown's  contention  that  the  words   "in
addition" introduced a quite separate ground given by  the  adjudicator  for
allowing the appeal, not at all part  of  the  Article  8  assessment,  Miss
Cronin sought a comparison in Mohamad Daoud [2005] EWCA Civ 755.

18.  This was a case where the  adjudicator  had  entirely  disbelieved  the
appellant's account of what had happened to him in the Sudan,  yet  accepted
that he belonged to the Massaleit tribe, which was being persecuted by  Arab
militias in Darfur.  His reasoning on the latter  point  was  introduced  by
the connective "thus", which Miss Cronin likened to  "in  addition"  in  the
instant case.  The court lamented the adjudicator's  failure  to  spell  out
the process of reasoning which led him to conclude that  the  appellant  was
of the Massaleit tribe, despite his lack of credibility in  other  respects.
But they were prepared to accept, "on the facts and in the mode  of  dealing
with the facts in this particular decision", that the adjudicator  could  be
understood to have given adequate reasons.

19.  We do not see how Daoud assists Miss Cronin.  It  was  clearly  decided
on its own particular facts, where differential  credibility  findings  were
said to be unsupported by a proper process of  reasoning.   In  the  instant
case, Miss Cronin would like to read across the contents  of  paragraph  27,
where the adjudicator deals with European law, into paragraph 26, where  she
deals with Article 8.  But it is clear from any straightforward  reading  of
the text that Miss Clough first  examines  in  paragraph  26  those  matters
which lead her, at #31, to allow the appeal under Article 8, and  then  goes
on at paragraph 27 to examine the matters which lead her, at #32,  to  allow
the appeal under Article 18 EC and  Directive  90/  364.   The  introductory
words to paragraph 27 ("in addition") do not mean  that  she  is  giving  an
additional reason for allowing the appeal under Article 8, but that  she  is
setting out a different  ground  for  allowing  the  appeal,  additional  to
Article 8.

20.  We should also say at this point that the adjudicator appears  to  have
misunderstood the effect of Chen.  Article 18 EC and Directive  90/  364  do
not, as she seems to express it at paragraph 27, grant an unqualified  right
to a minor child who is an EEA national, and to the primary  carer  of  that
child who is a non-EEA national, to reside indefinitely  in  another  Member
State.  The final paragraph of the judgment in Chen sums up the  conclusions
of the European Court in these terms (with emphasis added by us) :
            "Article 18 EC and Directive 90/ 364 confer on a young minor who
      is a national of a Member State, is covered  by  appropriate  sickness
      insurance and is in the care  of  a  parent  who  is  a  third-country
      national having sufficient resources for that minor not  to  become  a
      burden on the public finances of the host Member  State,  a  right  to
      reside for an indefinite period in that State.  In such circumstances,
      those same provisions allow a parent who is that child's primary carer
      to reside with the child in the host Member State."

21.  At paragraph 28  of  her  determination,  the  adjudicator  accepted  a
submission from Miss Cronin that, although both the mother  and  the  father
of the appellant's child were reliant on  public  finances,  that  situation
was unlikely to continue in the long term.   The  father  was  seeking  work
and, as Miss Cronin explained to us today, the care  which  the  mother  was
still receiving was geared towards making her self-reliant  in  the  future.
But the fact remains that the child is not  covered  by  sickness  insurance
and, both at the date of  decision  and  at  the  date  of  the  adjudicator
hearing, was a burden on the  public  finances  of  the  host  state  (which
expression is to be interpreted more widely than the 'public  funds'  listed
at paragraph 6 of the Immigration Rules).  The adjudicator  notes  that  the
child "accesses services by virtue of his age."  But  as  the  ECJ  held  in
Chen, the receipt of child care services by the child  was  insufficient  to
create a right of residence under Directive 73/  148,  while  Directive  90/
364 only conferred a right of  residence  upon  those  covered  by  sickness
insurance, who had sufficient resources to avoid becoming a  burden  on  the
host state.

22.  The adjudicator was therefore wrong to say that  "both  the  child  and
his father are exercising their Treaty Rights in the United Kingdom."   Only
the father has been  doing  that.   Miss  Cronin  urges  us  to  follow  the
guidance of her colleagues Rogers  and  Scannell,  the  learned  authors  of
'Free Movement of Persons in the Enlarged  European  Union',  who  detect  a
"softening" of approach by the ECJ in the light of Article 18  EC.   But  we
do not think this entitles us to go beyond the ECJ in Chen and  recognize  a
right to reside under European law for an EEA national child  and  his  non-
EEA national parent, when neither of them is covered by  sickness  insurance
and both of them are reliant on public finances.

23.  As a result of Chen new paragraphs 257C, D and E were inserted into  HC
395  from  1st  January  2005  (thus  predating  the  hearing   before   the
adjudicator, although no mention of them  is  made  in  her  determination).
These provide for "leave  to  enter  or  remain  as  the  primary  carer  or
relative of an EEA national  self-sufficient  child",  which  the  appellant
clearly is not.  Miss Cronin does not  think  that  'self-sufficient  child'
accurately reflects the requirement of Directive 90/ 364  not  to  become  a
burden on the public finances of the host state, but we  think  that,  as  a
form of shorthand, it serves the purpose well enough.

24.  To sum up, then, the appellant's son, although an EEA national, is  not
exercising Treaty rights in the UK.  The appellant's  fianc�  is  exercising
Treaty rights, but the appellant is not a 'family member' of his as  defined
by Regulation 6 of the EEA Regulations 2000, not being married to him.   The
appellant therefore derives no rights at all from European law, which  might
affect the assessment of proportionality under Article 8.   We  do  not  see
how, in any event, a person with no right to reside in the UK can  be  in  a
better position through having an Italian boyfriend than a British  one,  in
terms of the balancing exercise to be carried out under Article  8.   As  is
now well-known, the rights  of  other  family  members  who  are  not  being
removed are not for consideration on an appeal in  this  jurisdiction  under
Article 8.  The effect upon them of the  appellant's  removal  can  only  be
considered indirectly, as it impacts upon the appellant herself.   The  fact
that these family members might be  here  by  virtue  of  EU  free  movement
rights is irrelevant to the assessment of proportionality under  Article  8,
particularly when the person appealing under Article 8 does not  derive  any
rights under European law from her connexion with them.

25.  We are left, then, only with the question whether the adjudicator  made
a material error of law in her assessment of proportionality.  We find  that
the reasons which she gave at paragraph 26 of her determination  are  flawed
by such an error.  Her reference to  the  appellant's  "accepted  vulnerable
status and the oversight of her and  her  child  by  the  NSPCC  and  Newham
Social Work Department"  as  engaging  Article  8  contradicts  her  earlier
finding that Article 3 is  not  engaged  because  the  appellant  will  have
access to welfare organisations in Uganda and will be able  to  re-establish
contact with family members there.  Nor is the  adjudicator's  finding  that
the appellant's partner  "has  no  links  with  Uganda  and  would  find  it
difficult  to  settle  there"  sufficient  to  overcome  the  third  of  the
guidelines laid down by Lord Phillips MR in Mahmood  [2001]  INLR  1,  which
contemplates the family moving to the country to which one  of  its  members
is being expelled, provided  there  are  no  "insurmountable  obstacles"  to
their  living  together  in  that  country.   There  is  nothing  so  'truly
exceptional' about this case in Huang terms as  to  justify  overriding  the
Immigration Rules.

26.  We would mention in closing that, although the  appellant  fails  under
Article  8,  she  can  apply  for  a  residence  document  under   the   EEA
Regulations, and the application will of course be assessed in the light  of
her current circumstances, including the fact  that  her  boyfriend  is  now
working.


DECISION


The adjudicator having made a material error of law, we substitute  a  fresh
decision to dismiss the appeal under Article 8 of the  ECHR.   There  is  no
appeal before us on EC law grounds.
