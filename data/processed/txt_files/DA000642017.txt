                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Ren�, instructed by VLS Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Portugal born on 16th October 1996 and he
    appealed against the decision of the respondent to make  a  deportation
    order dated 26th October 2016 in accordance with Regulation 21  of  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 on the basis that
    the appellant's removal was justified on the grounds of public  policy,
    public security or public health.  The appeal was allowed by the First-
    tier tribunal.

 2. The background and criminal history for this appellant is that on  19th
    December 2012 he was remanded for battery and on 31st October  2013  he
    was sentenced to a youth rehabilitation order for robbery and  battery.
    On 20th November 2015 he was sentenced  to  four  years  detention  for
    conspiring to supply Class A drugs (heroin and cocaine) and failing  to
    comply with a Youth Rehabilitation Order.

 3. The Secretary of State appealed the First-tier Tribunal decision and at
    a hearing of 7th August 2017, I found an error of law in  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal, on  the  basis  that  the  judge  had  made
    contradictory  findings  and  failed  to  take  into  account  relevant
    evidence and, further made a misdirection of law.  It was  specifically
    submitted by the Secretary of State that there had been  a  substantial
    escalation in the seriousness of the appellant's offending and as  such
    it was submitted that the judge had materially erred in law by  failing
    correctly to analyse the threat posed by the appellant as  assessed  by
    the Probation Office.  Not least under MA (Pakistan)  [2014]  EWCA  Civ
    163 at paragraph 19 the court stated

         "a risk of 17% reoffending over a two year period  is  not,  in  my
         judgment in the context of deportation case, a matter  which  could
         be treated as insignificant.  It is good reasons for  supporting  a
         decision to deport".

    However, the matter could not be dealt with at 7th August 2017  because
    I found that the appellant was not legally represented, and the  matter
    was adjourned twice prior to the appellant having the opportunity to be
    represented.

 4. Although the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  was  set  aside,  the
    judge made a finding that the appellant  had  not  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities acquired the right of permanent residence in  the  United
    Kingdom.  This was because of the contradictory evidence, the  lack  of
    reliable supporting evidence and  the  absence  of  medical  insurance.
    That  finding  was  preserved  and  there  was  no  challenge  to  that
    conclusion.

 5. The appellant's parents were Mozambique nationals and  his  father  had
    secured Portuguese nationality.  As a result, the  appellant  had  both
    Mozambique and Portuguese nationality.  The appellant claimed  to  have
    entered the United Kingdom in 2009 although there  was  no  documentary
    evidence to support that contention. The appellant maintained  that  he
    had never lived in Portugal and came to the United Kingdom to  be  with
    his brother, sister and aunt. He produced a letter  from  City  Academy
    Norwich confirming that he attended there from  21st  January  2010  to
    22nd July 2011 and a letter from Great Yarmouth High School  confirming
    that he was a student there from 8th November 2011 to 30 January  2013.
    In evidence before the First-tier Tribunal, the brother, in his letter,
    stated that the appellant came to the UK in 2011  which  was  found  to
    conflict with the evidence from the school (attendance from 2010).  The
    appellant was resident in the UK when he received  his  reprimand  19th
    December 2012 and on 3rd October 2013 when he was convicted of  robbery
    and battery. He was remanded  in  custody  on  5th  February  2015  and
    detained thereafter until his release.

 6. The appellant is therefore afforded  the  lowest  level  of  protection
    under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

 7. At the hearing  before  me  both  representatives  confirmed  that  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 did  apply  (rather  than  the  2016
    regulations).  I set out paragraphs  19(3),  21(5)  and  21(6)  of  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006:

    19.-(3)  Subject to paragraphs (4) and  (5),  a  person  who  has  been
             admitted to, or acquired a right  to  reside  in,  the  United
             Kingdom under these Regulations may be removed from the United
             Kingdom if-

             (a)  he does not have or ceases to  have  a  right  to  reside
                  under these Regulations; or

             (b)  he would otherwise be entitled to reside  in  the  United
                  Kingdom under these Regulations but the Secretary of State
                  has decided that his removal is justified on  the  grounds
                  of public policy, public  security  or  public  health  in
                  accordance with regulation 21.

    21.-(5)  Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public policy
             or public security it shall, in addition to complying with the
             preceding  paragraphs  of  this  regulation,   be   taken   in
             accordance with the following principles-

             (a)   the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
                  proportionality;

             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
                  conduct of the person concerned;

             (c)   the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned  must
                  represent a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
                  threat affecting  one  of  the  fundamental  interests  of
                  society;

             (d)  matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
                  which relate to considerations of  general  prevention  do
                  not justify the decision;

             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
                  themselves justify the decision.

    21.-(6)  Before taking a relevant decision on  the  grounds  of  public
             policy or public security in  relation  to  a  person  who  is
             resident in the United Kingdom the decision  maker  must  take
             account of considerations such as the age,  state  of  health,
             family and economic situation  of  the  person,  the  person's
             length of residence in the United Kingdom, the person's social
             and cultural integration  into  the  United  Kingdom  and  the
             extent of the person's links with his country of origin.

 8. At the resumed hearing before me Mr Ren� submitted, on  behalf  of  the
    appellant, a skeleton argument and further  documentation  including  a
    letter from the appellant's older sister  Elisabeth  De  Cassimo  dated
    10th February 2018, a letter from Hugo De Almeda dated 10th February, a
    further witness statement from  the  appellant,  a  letter  from  Celso
    Almelda dated 8th February 2018, a letter from  the  Probation  Service
    dated 9th February 2018 and a letter from the Probation  Service  dated
    7th November 2017 and bank statements for the appellant.

 9. The  appellant  attended  and  gave  oral  testimony  and  adopted  his
    statement.  He confirmed  he  was  living  with  his  elder  sister  in
    Manchester and had done so since his release in July 2017.  He told the
    court that previously he was advised he was not  allowed  to  work  but
    another Probation Officer told him that he could, and  consequently  he
    started  work  four  weeks  ago.   He  was  working  for  Kerry   Fresh
    rearranging products on the pallets.  He worked overnight between  10pm
    and 6am.  He saw his Probation Officer once every  two  weeks  and  his
    Probation Officer was based in Oldham.  Since the index offence in 2015
    he explained that things had changed.  Previously he  had  been  living
    with his brother and he had never envisaged that he would go to prison.
     His brother's girlfriend or wife had assisted him  but  they  had  got
    divorced and support deteriorated.  He had undertaken courses in prison
    such as drug awareness, self awareness and a course on violence and how
    to get off drugs.  He had also  undertaken  academic  courses  such  as
    English and Maths and level 2 health and safety.  He confirmed that his
    girlfriend had visited him during his time in prison and she had been a
    girlfriend for four years.  His aim was to finish college and to return
    to carpentry.  His girlfriend was at university doing law at  Cambridge
    (although I received no independent evidence of that).

10. Under cross-examination he confirmed he now lived with his  sister  and
    her four children aged 18, 12, 8 and 5.  He confirmed that he  was  not
    currently enrolled at the City College in Norwich (as recorded  in  his
    statement) but had moved away.   It  was  put  to  him  that  in  Judge
    Trevaskis' determination there had been a reference to drugs  found  in
    his cell, but the appellant stated that he  had  never  been  presented
    with any form of formal adjudication in that regard. (Indeed, there was
    no such record in the papers  produced  to  the  Upper  Tribunal).   In
    contrast to the OASys Report he had been told that it was too early  to
    do another report but he had  produced  a  letter.   He  was  asked  in
    relation to the risk that he posed but there was not much he could  say
    but that he had obtained a job, but he had no family  in  Portugal  and
    his mother and father were in Mozambique.  The  Home  Office  suggested
    that it was proposed he would be removed to Portugal.

11. In his  submissions  Mr  Tufan  referred  to  the  OASys  Report  which
    identified  that  the  appellant  posed  a  medium  risk  of  harm  and
    reoffending.  The appellant had the lowest form of protection under the
    EEA Regulations and he currently posed a serious threat.  He had  never
    worked and had only obtained a job recently and was not even  aware  of
    what the date was that he obtained work.  There was no evidence he  was
    sufficiently integrated.  His  criminal  activity  had  escalated  from
    battery and robbery to being sentenced  for  four  years  for  a  drugs
    offence.  I was referred to MC (Essa principles recast) Portugal [2015]
    UKUT 00520 (IAC) particularly paragraph 10 of the  head  note.   As  it
    stands the  case  of  Robinson  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2018] EWCA Civ 85  concluded that the  Bouchereau  test  is
    still valid such that the gravity of offence will be of  a  sufficiency
    to show someone who is not integrated.

12. Mr Ren� by contrast made  submissions  that  the  appellant  had  given
    credible evidence and he referred me to the  letter  of  the  Probation
    Officer.  It had only been six months since he had been released and it
    was too early to undertake a full OASys Report but I  was  reminded  of
    the test under Regulation  21  that  the  appellant  had  to  be  of  a
    sufficiently serious and present threat and it must  be  looked  at  in
    relation to the index offence.  The appellant had been  to  prison  and
    learned the hard way.  He was young, born in 1996 and was only 22 years
    he wanted to go back to education.  He was  staying  with  his  sister.
    That he could not remember the date when he started work should not  be
    held against him.  He was integrated here, arrived in the UK at the age
    13 and had been educated  in  the  United  Kingdom.   Albeit  that  his
    criminality went against his integration his age was a  factor  and  he
    was involved with the wrong crowd.  The fact is that he had a level  of
    integration which may be  acceptable  in  Mozambique  but  he  was  not
    integrated into Portugal.  He had never lived there although  he  could
    speak the language.  The offences he had undertaken were  connected  to
    financial gain and he was now away from the area.  The letter from  the
    Probation Officer was a balanced and professional opinion  and  he  was
    better placed to make such findings which showed  the  appellant  in  a
    positive light.

Conclusions

13. Despite the reference in Mr Ren�'s submissions  and  skeleton  argument
    there was no evidence to show that  the  appellant  had  lived  in  the
    United Kingdom permanently  since  2009,  he  did  not  have  permanent
    residence and I consider that the relevant test was that as  enunciated
    in Regulation 21(5) and that "his personal  conduct  must  represent  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society".  The  fight  against  the  organised
    dealing of narcotics must form part  of  public  security  and  thus  a
    fundamental  interest  of  society  and  the  Secretary  of  State  was
    justified in concluding that supplying a Class A  drug  caused  serious
    harm and was against the fundamental interests of society (as  part  of
    the public policy requirements).

14. I have set out the specific regulations above  and  it  is  clear  that
    prior to taking any relevant decision on the grounds of  public  policy
    the decision maker must make a holistic proportionality assessment  and
    take into account considerations such as age, state of  health,  family
    and economic situations and the person's length  of  residence  in  the
    United Kingdom.   As set out in MC

         'In the absence of integration and a right of permanent  residence,
         the future prospects of integration  cannot  be  a  weighty  factor
         (Dumliauskas  [44]  and  [54]).  Even  when  such  prospects   have
         significant weight they are not a trump card, as what the Directive
         and the 2006 EEA Regulations require  is  a  wide-ranging  holistic
         assessment. Both recognise  that  the  more  serious  the  risk  of
         reoffending, and the offences that a person may commit, the greater
         the right to interfere with the right of residence (Dumliauskas  at
         [46] and [54]).

15. There is a difficulty for this appellant in that he did not provide any
    evidence of his date of entry.  He first came to the attention  of  the
    authorities in 2012 when he was reprimanded by Norfolk Constabulary for
    battery.  No firm independent evidence such as educational evidence has
    been provided to show anything other than the appellant arrived between
    2011 and 2012 and was promptly reprimanded on 19 December 2012  at  the
    age of 16 for battery.  Once again at the age of 16 he was convicted of
    robbery and battery and remanded on conditional bail and sentenced to a
    supervision requirement.   On  18th  May  2015  he  was  convicted  for
    conspiring to supply controlled Class A drugs (heroin and cocaine)  and
    for failing to comply  with  a  Youth  Rehabilitation  Order.   He  was
    sentenced to four years' detention at a young  offenders'  institution.
    The appellant was 18 years old when he was convicted  of  this  offence
    albeit that he was arrested in 2015 at the age of 17.

16. The sentencing judge in his case remarked on 20th November 2015

         "It is ... a wicked trade with a high price paid  in  human  misery
         ... Titos Cassimo, the nature and  scale  of  your  involvement  is
         significant. You were an active street dealer but  very  much  more
         than that.  He used your premises for storage  and  packaging.   He
         offered drugs for sale.  He made transactions directly ... you have
         contact with other dealing bases.  You both had crack  cocaine  and
         heroin in your home in large amount.   ....  Of  aside  from  those
         drugs seized your family had spoken  of  your  ongoing  involvement
         with dugs.  They have thrown  away  drugs  that  you  had  in  your
         possession ... you failed to  respond  to  your  family's  repeated
         efforts to cause you to desist.   The  phone  attributable  to  you
         contained a number of texts offering to supply Class A".

    As can be seen from above the appellant has other convictions and  from
    his OASys assessment on 24th October  2016  and  the  Offender  Manager
    found that he posed a  medium  risk  of  harm  to  the  public  and  on
    assessing it was found he had the potential to  do  serious  harm:  the
    offender manager found that although he posed a low risk of reoffending
    it was assessed as a medium risk of harm should he reoffend.

17. The reasons for refusal letter explained  that  the  trade  in  illicit
    drugs has a severe and negative impact on society,  and  as  the  judge
    observed, it is responsible for a high  price  paid  in  human  misery.
    Drug addiction affects not only the  drug  users  themselves  but  also
    their families, friends and communities and addicts are often driven to
    commit "ancillary crimes in order to  finance  their  habit".   Further
    Class A drugs are categorised  as  such  because  they  have  the  most
    serious detrimental impact on the health and  wellbeing  of  those  who
    become addicted to them.

18. As the sentencing remarks observed, the appellant appeared to have been
    well organised and played a significant role in the supply of the drugs
    as indicated by the sentence imposed.  I  take  note  of  the  case  of
    Robinson (Jamaica) [2018] EWCA Civ 85 which confirmed  that  a  serious
    offence can in itself indicate that  there  remains  a  threat  to  the
    requirements of public policy.  Robinson  (Jamaica)  confirmed  that  a
    previous criminal conviction can only be taken into account in  so  far
    as it provides evidence of personal  conduct  constituting  a  "present
    threat to the requirements of public policy" but it  is  possible  that
    past conduct "alone" may constitute a threat  to  the  requirements  of
    public policy.  That might be in circumstances which  involved  a  case
    generating 'deep public revulsion' such that the past conviction  alone
    may serve to show a  present  threat  to  the  requirements  of  public
    policy.

19. Without undermining the seriousness of  the  offence  (which  supplying
    Class A drugs must constitute) I am not persuaded that this is the kind
    of extreme case in which past conduct alone may suffice as constituting
    a present threat to the requirements of public policy.  That  does  not
    address the OASys report, however, which although from late 2016 is the
    current comprehensive assessment  of  his  risk  of  reoffending.   The
    offending can also indicate that integration has not  taken  place  and
    the appellant was convicted as an  adult  when  dealing  and  supplying
    Class  A  drugs.  The  convictions  of  this  appellant  indicated   an
    established pattern of  repeat  offending  within  a  relatively  short
    period of time. This does not indicate integration.   It is  the  index
    offence which indicates a very serious antisocial attitude towards  the
    public and community.

20. I take into account the fact that  the  appellant  was  young  when  he
    committed the offences of robbery and battery and I note that the index
    offence took place when the appellant was nearly  18  that  is  between
    29th April 2014 and 8th  October  2014.   The  appellant  has  provided
    letters from family to indicate their support for him, but it is  clear
    from the sentencing remarks of the judge that the family had spoken  of
    his ongoing involvement with drugs and the efforts that they have  made
    to cause him to stop but his resistance to that support.

21. I have considered the Probation Officer's reports of 7th November  2017
    and 9th February 2018.  The letter of  7th  November  2017  stated  "Mr
    Cassimo is currently complying and engaging  well  with  probation,  he
    reports on weekly supervision and has not missed any  appointments,  he
    will soon be reducing to fortnightly contact due to good conduct."

22. The Probation Officer stated

         "During supervision the focus has been on addressing his  offending
         behaviour, work relating to victim awareness,  drug  awareness  and
         his problem solving skills.  So far Mr Cassimo  has  shown  a  good
         understanding of each of these areas,  he  confirmed  that  he  has
         completed similar work while he was in custody and it is clear that
         he has retained the learning and able to understand how they impact
         on his behaviour to a good level.  I have only known Mr Cassimo for
         three months I cannot yet assess how his maturity has changed since
         the time of the offence.  However to date he has been  making  good
         progress with myself.

         In regards to his education training and employment Mr Cassimo  has
         been really interested in getting back into education to complete a
         carpentry course.  Unfortunately there was  some  confusion  around
         his eligibility to be able to return to  education  or  employment.
         Mr Cassimo and myself  both  contacted  his  previous  Home  Office
         caseworker who relayed to us that Mr Cassimo was  not  eligible  to
         seek education or employment.  However recently Mr Cassimo has been
         transferred to a new caseworker who was informed us that Mr Cassimo
         is currently eligible to seek education, employment and any changes
         will depend on the result from the court case.  Although Mr Cassimo
         is motivated to finish his carpentry course, he has not yet applied
         due to missing the start of the academic year ...  It  is  best  to
         follow an alternate direction in the short term and find employment
         to be able to help his sister financially and then start his course
         in the new academic year."

23. This letter then commented on the terms of the risk assessment that the
    appellant currently was assessed as posing that being a medium risk  of
    harm to the general public specifically drug users.

24. In the letter dated 9th February 2018 this repeated that

         "Mr Cassimo is currently assessed as medium  risk  to  the  general
         public specifically drug users.  The nature of the risk was through
         the supplying and misuse of drugs.  Individuals  who  obtain  drugs
         though Mr Cassimo's services may not be aware of the  serious  risk
         there are putting themselves at.  By misusing drugs the  nature  of
         the risk is that of emotional, psychological and physical  harm  as
         well as financial loss.  Mr Cassimo will also get risk  to  himself
         if he was to misuse the drugs he had possession of.

25. There were references in the papers which suggested that the  appellant
    had been left by his brother without food and I note that the Probation
    Officer stated

         "The risk is likely to  be  greatest  when  Mr  Cassimo's  need  of
         financial gain mainly due to paying  rent.   However  currently  Mr
         Cassimo is residing at his sister's accommodation in  Oldham,  this
         is a protective factor for Mr Cassimo, he has removed himself  from
         the area where the index offence occurred and he has also  detached
         himself from his associates.  Mr Cassimo  and  his  sister  have  a
         supportive relationship and the family environment  is  a  positive
         factor for Mr Cassimo.  Mr Cassimo's risk would increase if he  was
         to lose this accommodation with his sister and  was  left  with  no
         stable accommodation."

26. The letter written by this sister who explained that she could not come
    to court because of her young children being at school.

27. She also stated

         "Living here with me is just one of  many  decisions  he  has  made
         since he has been released in order to better  his  life  and  move
         forward from the mistakes he made.  My brother  chose  to  distance
         himself from the area and people that were  a  bad  influence  thus
         leading him down the wrong path in committing them [sic] crimes and
         has been actively searching for jobs.  Attending  meetings  at  the
         Job Centre, putting together a CV and calling companies asking  for
         employment as well as opening up a bank  account  to  try  and  get
         himself back on his feet and ready to build a new life.  He secured
         himself employment and with his wages he helps  with  bills  around
         the house, treats his nieces and nephews and also saves  money  for
         future investments."

    His sister then proceeded to state that having young  children  in  the
    house would not lead her to welcome him if she thought he would  return
    to his old ways but she considered that he has "shown so much grown and
    maturity since his release.  I really believe that he has left the past
    in the past".  She also detailed how the appellant  would  assist  with
    taking the children to school in the morning and bringing them home  as
    well as attending school meetings.

28. The appellant speaks Portuguese.  I have identified that the  appellant
    was born in Mozambique  where  Portuguese  is  the  official  language.
    There was no evidence that he had spent any time in Portugal  or  would
    be accustomed to the culture there and I accept that he would have  no-
    one to support him on the basis that it was  his  father  who  acquired
    Portuguese nationality.  There was, however, no evidence to  show  that
    he would be unable to relocate to Portugal. I do consider that he is  a
    healthy adult male with the ability to find work.   At  present  he  is
    involved in unskilled labour.  There was no evidence that he would  not
    be able to attend college in Portugal.

29. Since his time in the United Kingdom he has secured a  girlfriend,  but
    they do not live together, and she has not in fact  been  a  protective
    factor.  His serious offence and continued offending indicate  that  he
    has not integrated.

30. The Secretary of State is proposing to remove the appellant to Portugal
    where he states he has no contacts at all and  as  he  states  "all  my
    friends are here and all the family I am still in touch with are here".
     On the other hand, the appellant's difficulties were said, in part, to
    be the company he kept, and I  note  that  the  appellant  has  already
    removed himself from the immediate area and those friends which have  a
    bad influence on him. He has  already  thus  relocated.  The  appellant
    states clearly that he was mixing with the  wrong  crowd  when  he  was
    younger which influenced his decisions.  His  friends,  as  he  admits,
    have been a poor influence rather than enhancing  any  contribution  of
    his to society, and have not prevented his offending which is  at  odds
    with integration.   He  has  confirmed  that  during  his  sentence  he
    completed various courses including drug awareness,  victim  awareness,
    self awareness, painting and  decorating,  health  and  safety,  retail
    market, level 2 in  English  and  Maths,  BICS  cleaning  level  2  and
    construction  level  1.   He  also  gave  evidence  during  his   court
    appearance that he was  a  unit  cleaner.   Albeit  that  there  was  a
    reference in the First-tier Tribunal decision of drugs being  found  in
    his cell, there was in fact no evidence of those  findings  within  the
    papers  and  no  evidence  of  any  adjudication  and   the   appellant
    categorically denied this.

31. Despite the lack of integration some, albeit limited,  weight  must  be
    given to the concept of rehabilitation.  The Home  Office  proposed  to
    remove him to Portugal and I specifically note at the head note  of  MC
    that gauging such prospects of rehabilitation requires assessing  their
    relative prospects of rehabilitation in the host Member State  compared
    with the Member State of origin but "in the absence of evidence  it  is
    not to be assumed that the prospects are materially different  in  that
    other Member State (Dumliauskas)". Referring to MC, in the  absence  of
    integration and a right of permanent residence, the future prospects of
    rehabilitation  cannot  be  a  weighty  factor.  'Mere  capability   of
    rehabilitation is  not  to  be  equated  with  reasonable  prospect  of
    rehabilitation'.

32. The Probation Office confirmed that the appellant and his sister had  a
    supportive relationship and that "the family environment is a  positive
    factor for Mr Cassimo.  Mr Cassimo's risk would increase if he  was  to
    lose this accommodation with his sister and was  left  with  no  stable
    accommodation".

33. The Probation  Officer  found  that  the  appellant  was  showing  good
    progress with probation and was complying and  engaging  well  and  was
    currently showing evidence that he was willing to progress and  lead  a
    pro-social life.  This would continue to be  monitored  throughout  the
    rest of his sentence.  At present the appellant is able to  financially
    support himself, he is thus capable of work, and has been cared for  by
    his sister but the appellant has committed a serious  criminal  offence
    of supplying drugs and the reports indicated that he would continue  to
    remain  a  risk.   There  has  been   improvement   in   his   personal
    circumstances as  witnessed  by  the  Probation  Officer  report.   The
    appellant is on a licence which will expire on 5th February 2019.  That
    will not however prevent reoffending.  The professional  assessment  of
    risk posed by  the  appellant  was  upon  his  release.   His  personal
    circumstances, which have influenced that risk are said to have altered
    since that assessment and I take into account the  Probation  Officer's
    guarded comments in that regard. Although his sister  had  removed  him
    from Norwich to her own family home, his  brother  and  sister  clearly
    failed to  prevent  him  from  committing  serious  crimes  previously,
    despite  reference  in  the  papers  to  their  previous  efforts.  The
    appellant has now secured employment albeit of a fairly  recent  nature
    although I accept on the strength of the evidence  from  the  Probation
    Officer that the appellant was initially advised that he was  not  able
    to work. There were bank accounts showing that the appellant has indeed
    been paid for his employment.

34. The OASys assessment showed that the risk of reoffending was linked  to
    accommodation, ETE, finance  and  lifestyle  and  associates  and  drug
    misuse.  His probability of proven reoffending over the two-year period
    had a 42% chance and categorised as low.  The probability of proven non-
    violent reoffending, however, was assessed, however, as 45% in the two-
    year period which was medium.  I take into  account  that,  as  I  have
    identified, this appellant conducted his criminal offending when he was
    just under the age of 18 albeit he was convicted as an adult  and  that
    he now has a stable accommodation, support  from  his  sister  and  has
    relocated away from his associates and has secured himself  employment.
    There has,  however,  been  no  formal  reassessment  of  his  risk  of
    reoffending at present, although the Probation  Officer  most  recently
    stated, he is showing good progress and is complying and engaging  well
    and  will  lead  a  pro-social  life.   The  most  recent  was  not   a
    comprehensive report and expressed in  understandably  reticent  terms.
    Essentially he is at medium risk of reoffending.

35. Should the appellant be removed to Portugal  those  protective  factors
    will be removed.  Despite him undertaking very recent  work  there  was
    little evidence of rehabilitation that the appellant had commenced, and
    I am not persuaded that, when afforded the lowest level  of  protection
    from deportation, that rehabilitation is a very significant factor.

36. No evidence was put before me to indicate very significant difficulties
    for the appellant in Portugal.  He can speak Portuguese,  he  is  young
    fit and able and it will be open to him to find work should he wish  to
    in Portugal.   He has not spent the majority of his life in the UK  and
    no doubt his family can support him financially whilst  he  establishes
    himself in Portugal. On balance I find that he does represent a genuine
    present and sufficiently serious threat to fundamental  interests  such
    that he should be removed  under  the  EEA  Regulations.  As  such  the
    decision  to  remove  him  to  Portugal  is  justified   in   all   the
    circumstances.

37. The appellant has established a private  life  in  the  United  Kingdom
    since his entry in  2011/2012  and  his  removal  would  constitute  an
    interference in his private life.  Although he has a girlfriend they do
    not live together, and I am not persuaded that  he  has  established  a
    family life with his sister with whom he has only  been  living  for  a
    short  period.  He  is  financially  supporting  himself  although  she
    provides accommodation. The Immigration  Rules  specifically  paragraph
    A398 to 399D reflect the position taken by the Secretary of State  when
    considering an Article 8 claim from  a  person  liable  to  deportation
    although they do  not  strictly  apply  to  the  appellant  as  an  EEA
    national, but they are a guide only  to  human  rights  considerations.
    Further considerations set by parliament are to be found in Section 117
    of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The appellant  has
    been convicted of an offence for which he was imprisoned for four years
    and although his offending was when he was on the brink  of  adulthood,
    his deportation is considered to be conducive to the  public  good.  As
    set out in the decision letter the appellant has received  a  reprimand
    and two convictions for five serious offences.  He offended  almost  as
    soon as he entered the UK.  I have reviewed all the  evidence  provided
    by the appellant but do not find any compelling circumstances such that
    he should not be removed. Even his length of residence in  the  UK  was
    not supported with evidence.  He is fit and able to work and can  speak
    Portuguese.  He can continue to stay in contact  with  his  family  via
    modern methods. Nothing placed before me persuades me that the decision
    to remove him would prejudice his Article 8 rights  in  a  sufficiently
    serious manner  to  allow  the  appeal.  The  Secretary  of  State  has
    justified any such breach of his human rights.

Notice of Decision

I dismiss the appeal under the EEA Regulations and on Human Rights grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
