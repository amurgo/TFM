                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    Introduction

    1.     The Appellant (the Secretary of State)  appealed  to  the  Upper
         Tribunal with  permission  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         Heynes on 2 June 2015 against the decision and  reasons  of  First-
         tier Tribunal Judge Blum who had allowed on Article 8 ECHR  grounds
         only the Respondent's appeal against the  refusal  on  27  November
         2013 of her application for entry clearance as  the  partner  of  a
         person present and settled in the United Kingdom.  The decision and
         reasons was promulgated on 31 March 2015.

    2.     The Respondent is a national of Guyana, born  on  12  May  1985.
         The Respondent had applied to  enter  the  United  Kingdom  as  the
         spouse of Mr Abdool Rahiman, born in Guyana on 12 October 1944  and
         a British Citizen by naturalisation.  The Entry  Clearance  Officer
         had not accepted that the relationship relied on  was  genuine  and
         subsisting.  It was accepted before the  First-tier  Tribunal  (see
         [29] of the determination) that the Respondent could not  meet  the
         financial requirements of Appendix FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
         The judge nevertheless found that the interference with the respect
         due to her and to her spouse's family life pursuant  to  Article  8
         ECHR was disproportionate.

    3.     Permission to appeal was granted  by  Judge  Heynes  because  he
         considered that it was arguable that the judge had  failed  to  (a)
         identify  factors  calling  for  a  free-standing  Article  8  ECHR
         assessment; (b) attach any weight to the financial requirements  of
         Appendix FM and (c)  take  into  account  section  117B(1)  of  the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002

    4.     Standard directions were made by the tribunal,  indicating  that
         the decision would be remade in the event that a material error  of
         law were found.  A rule 24 notice opposing the onwards  appeal  was
         filed on the Respondent's behalf.

    Submissions

    5.     Mr Walker for the Appellant relied on  the  grounds  of  onwards
         appeal and the grant of permission to appeal.   He  submitted  that
         although the judge had made reference to  the  public  interest  at
         [42]  of  his  determination,  that  had  been  insufficient.   The
         maintenance requirements of Appendix FM were ipso facto  indicative
         of where the  public  interest  lay.   The  judge's  reasoning  and
         analysis were defective.  It was open to the Respondent to  make  a
         fresh entry clearance  application  which  met  Appendix  FM.   The
         decision and reasons should be set aside, remade and dismissed.

    6.     Ms Murshid for the Respondent relied on the rule 24 notice.  She
         submitted that there was no error  of  law  and  the  determination
         should  stand.   The  judge  had  found  a  reasonable   case   for
         considering the entry clearance application outside the Immigration
         Rules.  Paragraph EX.1 of  Appendix  FM  did  not  apply  to  entry
         clearance  applications.   The  judge  had  identified   compelling
         circumstances  and  had   considered   section   117B(1)   of   the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   Those  factors  had
         been  taken  into  account  and  there  was  no  justification  for
         interfering with the judge's decision.  The onwards  appeal  should
         be dismissed and the original decision upheld.

    7.     There was no reply.

    8.     The tribunal indicated at the conclusion of submissions that  it
         found that there were material errors of law.

    Material error of law finding

    9.     The tribunal accepts the  submissions  made  on  behalf  of  the
         Secretary of State.  In short, the tribunal finds  that  the  judge
         fell into the error of law identified by the Court of Appeal in  MM
         (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA Civ 985, where MM [2013]  EWHC  1900  (Admin)
         was overturned.  It was not open to the judge to substitute his own
         view of what amounted to financial sufficiency as he did  at,  e.g.
         [41], of his determination.  As Lord Carnwath  stated  at  [57]  of
         Patel [2013] UKSC 72: "It is important to remember that  article  8
         is not a general dispensing power."

    10.     Nor  did  the   judge   identify,   or   adequately   identify,
         circumstances arising from the admitted failure to satisfy Appendix
         FM which could sensibly be  described  as  unjustifiably  harsh  or
         compelling circumstances  not  identified  within  the  Immigration
         Rules.  Thus  the  requirement  for  a  second  stage  analysis  or
         evaluation was never reached.

    11.    There had been no challenge by the Secretary  of  State  to  the
         judge's findings of  fact.   The  determination  is  otherwise  set
         aside.

    Remaking the decision

    12.    Given that the judge's findings  of  fact  stood,  neither  side
         wished  to  make  any  further  submissions.    For   clarity   and
         convenience the tribunal will now refer to  the  parties  by  their
         original designations in the First-tier Tribunal.

    13.    As noted above, the entry clearance application had been refused
         because the Entry Clearance Officer  was  not  satisfied  that  the
         relationship was genuine and subsisting, and that the Appellant and
         her sponsor intended to live together  permanently  in  the  United
         Kingdom.  Judge Blum found that the relationship was  genuine:  see
         [21] to [28] of  the  determination.    Some  might  consider  that
         finding generous given some of the facts the judge identified, such
         as the huge age difference and the surprising speed of the marriage
         following the collapse of the sponsor's previous relationship  with
         a United Kingdom resident: see [23] of the determination.   Perhaps
         the judge's comment at [43] that "I found this a difficult decision
         to make" may reflect that. Nevertheless, the judge saw the  sponsor
         and there was no challenge to his finding about  the  substance  of
         the spousal relationship.

    14.    As also noted above, it was conceded before the judge  that  the
         Appellant was unable  to  satisfy  the  financial  requirements  of
         Appendix FM, as at the date of the  decision.   Importantly,  there
         was no evidence before the judge that  the  Appellant  through  her
         sponsor could  never  meet  the  financial  requirements.   On  the
         contrary, it was said that the sponsor was employed  post  decision
         and was in a position to meet the financial requirements.

    15.    But on the facts found (see [33] to [35] of  the  determination)
         employment  was  just  one  of  the  possibilities  open   to   the
         Appellant's sponsor for meeting the  financial  requirements.   The
         sponsor already had a pension income.  He claimed that he  received
         ï¿½6,000 per year from lodgers and had cash savings.  In the event he
         failed to  produce  adequate  evidence  of  those  matters  at  the
         hearing.  Any such documents were, of course, required by  Appendix
         FM-SE to have been produced with the entry  clearance  application,
         so that they could be verified, a most important requirement  which
         must not be overlooked.  There is, however, no  reason  to  believe
         that the sponsor would be unable to produce proper evidence in  the
         future.  Perhaps most importantly of all, the sponsor was found  to
         own his own home, with very substantial  equity  according  to  the
         sponsor's valuation.  The tribunal  finds  that  it  is  plain  and
         obvious that the Appellant through her  sponsor  had  and  is  more
         likely than not still has the realistic opportunity  and  potential
         ability to meet Appendix FM.

    16.    Are there any compelling circumstances which might  require  the
         Secretary of State to  consider  the  exercise  of  her  discretion
         outside the Immigration Rules?   Would  the  Appellant's  temporary
         exclusion pending making a compliant application have unjustifiably
         harsh consequence?  (See SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387).

    17.    In approaching this appeal, it seems to the  tribunal  important
         that both the Appellant and her sponsor are Guyanese.  The  sponsor
         lived in Guyana until the age of 29 and is likely  to  be  familiar
         with its culture and any  indigenous  language:  see  [39]  of  the
         determination.  He then worked most of his adult life in the United
         Kingdom.  The obvious inference is that the  sponsor  came  to  the
         United Kingdom in search of a more prosperous life,  which  he  has
         indeed found.   His move was not shown to be as the result  of  any
         problem in Guyana.

    18.    The tribunal finds that both the Appellant and the sponsor  were
         aware or should have made themselves aware at the time they  formed
         their relationship that the Appellant as a Guyanese national  would
         require leave to settle in the United Kingdom.  At the  stage  that
         they decided to marry with the intention that the  Appellant  would
         come to the United Kingdom to live they fell under the  obligations
         of the Immigration  Rules,  applicable  to  all  persons  in  their
         situation.

    19.    It is also inevitably the case that  one  spouse  or  the  other
         would have to leave family behind in their  home  country.   In  Mr
         Rahiman's case, he still has family in Guyana.  The Appellant  also
         has family in Guyana: see [38] of the determination.   Mr Rahiman's
         children did not attend his wedding (see [40] of the determination)
         and  the  judge  found  he  did  not  have  a  particularly  strong
         relationship with them, or his sister.

    20.    The tribunal accordingly finds that Mr  Rahiman's  ties  to  the
         United Kingdom are not particularly strong.  As at the date of  the
         decision he was not working.  There were no  other  family  members
         living in his home, which was partly let to strangers.   There  was
         no evidence of wider community involvement on his  part,  or  other
         potentially important private life.

    21.    Taking all of those facts and matters into account, the tribunal
         finds that there are no compelling circumstances  or  unjustifiably
         harsh consequences, nothing exceptional.   The  Appellant  and  the
         sponsor would be able to enjoy family life together in  Guyana,  as
         they have  done  during  Mr  Rahiman's  visits  there  since  their
         marriage.  The couple's wish  to  settle  together  in  the  United
         Kingdom is their choice.

    22.    If for any reason the tribunal were mistaken to find that  there
         are no compelling circumstances which would  warrant  consideration
         of the Appellant's case outside the Immigration Rules, the tribunal
         will conduct a Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 analysis and evaluation.   The
         tribunal has  accepted  that  there  is  family  life  between  the
         Appellant and her sponsor.  The tribunal does not accept  that  the
         Entry Clearance Officer's refusal amounts to an interference.   The
         Appellant  had  no  right  to  enter  the  United  Kingdom   absent
         satisfying Appendix FM.  The tribunal has found that the  Appellant
         and her sponsor can enjoy family life in Guyana and have done so.

    23.    If for any reason the tribunal were mistaken to  find  that  the
         Entry  Clearance  Officer's  decision  did   not   amount   to   an
         interference, the  live  issue  becomes  proportionality.   As  the
         tribunal  has  already  found,  there  was  no  evidence  that  the
         Appellant would never be able to meet the financial requirements of
         Appendix FM.  There was  no  evidence  of  any  pressing  situation
         (e.g., serious illness of  either  partner)  which  might  tip  the
         proportionality balance.    The tribunal finds that it  is  in  the
         interests of immigration control which is in summary  a  legitimate
         objective of Article  8.2  ECHR  for  the  Appellant  to  meet  the
         financial requirements of Appendix FM. There was  no  finding  that
         the Appellant had breached United Kingdom  immigration  control  in
         the past (see the discussion at [22] of Judge Blum's determination)
         and of course she had quite properly applied  for  entry  clearance
         from Guyana.

    24.    The tribunal now considers  section  117B  of  the  Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  "Financial independence" for  the
         purposes  of  section  117B(3)  when  applied  to   a   prospective
         partner/spouse entrant must logically mean as defined  in  Appendix
         FM, i.e., meeting the financial requirements there prescribed:  see
         MM (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA Civ 985.  In any  event,  sections  117A-D
         identify factors to be taken  into  account,  and  create  no  free
         standing rights: see Dube [2015] UKUT 00090 (IAC).

    25.     It  follows  that  the  tribunal  finds  that  the  Appellant's
         exclusion pending a compliant further entry  clearance  application
         is a proportionate breach of Article 8 ECHR  and  is  lawful.   Any
         future entry clearance  application  will  of  course  have  to  be
         assessed on the evidence presented at that date.   The  Appellant's
         appeal is dismissed.

    26.    As a footnote the tribunal adds that it is unfortunate that this
         appeal has been a long drawn out process.  That is not the fault of
         either the First-tier Tribunal or the  Upper  Tribunal.   It  is  a
         question of the resources made available to HMCTS at a time  of  an
         over-burdened  public  purse.   The   tribunal   reminds   overseas
         appellants that it is possible to  make  a  fresh  entry  clearance
         application  notwithstanding  an  earlier  refusal  and  a  pending
         appeal.  That is in contrast to "in country"  applications.   While
         there may be further expense incurred by  a  fresh  application,  a
         faster result may be seen as compensatory.

    DECISION
