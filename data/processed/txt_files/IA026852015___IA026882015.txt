Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr S Dey of Lexpert Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The first appellant, a citizen  of  Sri  Lanka  born  in  1986  entered
    Britain in September 2009 as a  Tier  4  (General)  Student.   She  was
    granted leave in that capacity until 29 February 2012.   In  July  2012
    she was granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (Post-
    Study) Migrant until 19 July 2014.  On 11 July that year  she  made  an
    application for further leave to remain as a Tier 2 (General)  Migrant.
    The second appellant, her husband has been her dependant throughout.

2.   Her application was refused  because  she  had  not  provided  a  valid
    Certificate of Sponsorship reference number.  Consequently she received
    no points for the appropriate salary.

3.   She and her husband appealed.  Their appeals were  heard  by  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Shepherd on 1 October 2015 and dismissed  in  a
    determination promulgated on 29 October 2015.  She appeals against  the
    decision of Judge Shepherd.

4.   The appellants did not attend the hearing.  The judge noted  that  when
    making the application to switch from Tier 1  to  a  Tier  2  (General)
    Migrant the first appellant had secured a job with a Tier 2 sponsor  to
    work at the "Al Faisals" Restaurant in Sparkbrook, West Midlands  as  a
    business consultant at  a  salary  of  ï¿½22,500  per  annum.   With  her
    application she had submitted a copy of a  Certificate  of  Sponsorship
    issued by Al Faisals.   However,  before  the  decision  was  made  the
    Certificate of Sponsorship had been withdrawn.  It was  the  submission
    of the appellants that as  the  Certificate  of  Sponsorship  had  been
    "revoked" the Secretary of State had been under a duty to offer  a  "60
    day grace" period for the first appellant to find another sponsor.

5.   The judge considered the documents before him which included a copy  of
    the "migrant CAS checking - COS details" dated 12  December  2014  from
    the UKVI database.  He  noted  that  with  the  application  the  first
    appellant had given  a  Certificate  of  Sponsorship  reference  number
    C2G3N8439L bearing a date that had been assigned on 10 July 2014.   The
    judge noted the summary of the job description and noted  that  it  had
    been claimed the role fitted within the job type in Appendix  [J]  2423
    for "management consultants and business analyst".

6.   He noticed that the appellant had  not  been  awarded  points  for  the
    Certificate of Sponsorship because the certificate had  been  cancelled
    by UK Visas and Immigration  and  noted  that  the  grounds  of  appeal
    asserted that the decision was not in accordance with the principles of
    fairness, relying on the decision in Naved (Student - fairness - notice
    of points)  [2012]  UKUT  14  (IAC).   He  noticed  moreover  that  the
    appellant had stated that the respondent had been aware that the Tier 2
    sponsor licence of the sponsor had been revoked by the  respondent  but
    at the time of making the application the sponsor company  was  on  the
    list of Tier 2 sponsors.  He noticed a reference to Thakur (Bangladesh)
    (PBS - common law fairness) [2011] UKUT 00151 and  that  the  appellant
    had said that she had been unable  to  apply  to  a  different  sponsor
    because of the refusal of her Tier 2 application.  He  noted  that  the
    appellant's copy of the COS submitted show that it was  extant  at  the
    date it was assigned whereas that from the UKVI database showed that it
    had by that date had a "cancelled" status.  It had  been  submitted  to
    the judge by the Presenting Officer that  the  appellants   could  have
    enquired of the sponsor what had happened to  the  COS  and  ask  if  a
    fresh COS could be obtained but, in any event,  the  whole  premise  of
    the Tier 2 application was there must be valid employment and that that
    was clearly not the case.

7.   The judge set  out  his  findings  and  conclusions  in  paragraphs  34
    onwards.  He noted that the appellant had been given a  start  date  of
    her employment by Al Faisals of 18 July 2014 but there is no indication
    if she had ever started work there.  She said that the implication  was
    that if the applicant had started work for Al Faisals  then  she  would
    have been aware of  any  investigations  by  UKVI  and  the  threatened
    cancellation of the sponsorship.  However, she pointed that she had  no
    way of knowing what the situation was as if, of course,  the  applicant
    had not started working for Al Faisals  by  the  date  of  decision  in
    December 2014, five months after the  date  of  application,  then  she
    would certainly draw an adverse inference to  the  genuineness  of  the
    offer of employment.  She noted that there  was  no  evidence  from  Al
    Failsals  itself  to  support  the  appellant's   argument   that   the
    cancellation of the COS was capricious,  malicious  and  discriminatory
    and stated that in the Rules it was the case that if the COS  had  been
    cancelled by the UKVI since it was assigned then that was a sustainable
    ground for refusal and that the only way for the appellant  to  succeed
    in the appeal would be to show  that  the  cancellation  was  unlawful.
    That had not been demonstrated.  She questioned the assertions  of  the
    first appellant that she had only known about the cancellation  of  the
    COS when she received the decision letter  particularly  as  the  judge
    would have expected her to have started work by that time.   The  judge
    distinguished this case from that in Naved where  the  appellant  could
    not have known of the enquiries being made by the respondent.

8.   She therefore considered that the cancellation of the  COS  was  lawful
    and dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules.   She  considered
    the assertions made by the first appellant regarding her  rights  under
    Article 8 of the ECHR but stated that not only could those not  succeed
    under the Rules but that they could not succeed outside the  Rules  and
    that as she did not  consider  that  the  appellant  was  a  victim  of
    circumstances outside  her  control  she  did  not  consider  that  the
    decision was disproportionate - there was no reason why  the  appellant
    and her husband could not resume their married life on  return  to  Sri
    Lanka.

9.   She therefore dismissed the appeal.

10.  The grounds of appeal stated that in effect the  judge  had  not  taken
    into account relevant considerations in that it was speculative  as  to
    whether or not the appellant would been a party to  negotiations  which
    were going on between the sponsor and the UKVI,  that the decision  was
    unfair and that further there had been an improper  assessment  of  the
    appellant's human rights claim.

11.  At the hearing of the appeal before me Mr Dey having pointed  out  that
    the judge who granted permission to appeal had misunderstood a possible
    reason for refusing the application,  referred to policy guidance dated
    24 November 2016 which at sections 23.25 onwards dealt with  the  issue
    of the cancelling of a Certificate of Sponsorship.  He emphasised there
    were no examples of misrepresentation  or  fraud  which  the  appellant
    could have addressed in her grounds of appeal.  He  asserted  that  the
    burden lay on the Secretary of State  to  provide  the  appellant  with
    reasons for the decision and the fact that the Secretary of  State  did
    not do so showed unfairness.

12.  In reply Mr Bramble pointed out that the appellant could  herself  have
    contacted her employer to find out what had happened but did not appear
    to have done so - there is no indication in the witness statements that
    she had made enquiries of the employer let alone that she  had  already
    started work when the COS was withdrawn.  He asked  me  to  distinguish
    the cases of Naved and Thakur and pointed out that the guidance put  in
    by Mr Dey did not relate to the time period when  the  application  and
    then this decision were made.

13.  In reply  Mr  Dey  argued  that  had  information  been  given  by  the
    respondent the appellant could have replied thereto  -  it  was  unfair
    that no reasons had been given.

Discussion

14.  I consider that there is no material error of law in the  determination
    of the judge.

15.  The first appellant did not have a Certificate of Sponsorship when  the
    decision was made.  The Secretary  of  State  was  therefore  right  to
    refuse the application.  The comments of the judge when he stated  that
    the appellant should have contacted  the  employer,  if  she  were  not
    already working, were apt.  There is  a  clear  distinction  between  a
    situation where an  appellant  wishes  to  obtain  work  here  from  an
    employer and indeed is in a position to start work and would  therefore
    surely be aware that the COS was being withdrawn and what  the  reasons
    for that were,  and the position of a student who does not know why the
    Certificate of Acceptance has been withdrawn.  In the latter case - the
    situation which is relevant in the cases of both Naved and  Thakur  the
    appellant was at a disadvantage because he was unable to find out  what
    the reason was.  In this case the appellant clearly was in  a  position
    to find out and at the very least could have informed the court  either
    by giving evidence orally - it appears that she opted and paid the  fee
    for an oral hearing but was advised by her solicitors that it  was  not
    necessary or appropriate to turn up - or at the very least  could  have
    explained what attempt she had made to find out from her  employer  why
    the COS had  been  withdrawn.   I  have  considered  the  Guidance  for
    Sponsors dated 24 November 2016 to which  Mr  Dey  drew  my  attention.
    However,  not only is it out of date but  it  appears  to  be  guidance
    issued to employers and the section to which he  particularly  referred
    related to Certificates  of  Sponsorship  which  the  respondent  found
    should not have been assigned if, for  example  it  had  been  assigned
    through fraud or if a Certificate of  Sponsorship  was  assigned  to  a
    migrant which had not been used to support an application for leave  to
    enter or remain in Britain.  Reference is made  to  the  sponsor's  SMS
    account.  The section relating to a 60 day period had been given to  an
    employee to give them a chance to find a new  sponsor  being  shortened
    relates to those to whom the sponsorship has already been provided.   I
    am unable to find on the file the guidance to which the judge refers in
    his determination but assuming that  it  was  similar  to  that  placed
    before me by Mr Dey the reality is the 60 day period would only  relate
    to those to whom a COS  had  been  provided  and  who  are  already  in
    employment.

16.  Taking all these matters into account I find that  the  judge  properly
    considered the  evidence  before  her  and  she  reached  findings  and
    conclusions which were correct in law.  I would add that I can find  no
    error of law in her consideration of  the  Article  8  rights  of  this
    appellant who would be returning to Sri Lanka with her husband and  was
    not entitled to expect that she would qualify for indefinite  leave  to
    remain here.

17.  I therefore find that  there  is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    determination of the Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  that  her
    decision to dismiss this appeal on both immigration  and  human  rights
    grounds shall stand.
