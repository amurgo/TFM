                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. The appellant, who is a citizen of Sri Lanka, was born on  1  September
    1983.  While in this country lawfully as a student, with permission  to
    remain until 30 June 2011, he applied for further leave to remain as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant under the  points-based  system.   The
    application was made on 26 June 2012.

 2. This application was deemed by the  respondent  to  have  been  invalid
    because the correct fee had not been paid.  It is the appellant's  case
    that there is no reason why the requisite fee would not have been paid,
    because there were sufficient funds in the account of the bank on which
    his payment had been drawn.

 3.  After being notified by the respondent that his application  had  been
    rejected as invalid because the  appropriate  fee  had  not  been  paid
    (which  the  appellant  disputes)  the   appellant   re-submitted   his
    application, enclosing (the appellant would  say  again)  the  relevant
    application fee.  This application was refused by the respondent  on  5
    December 2012.  The refusal letter is dated the same date.

 4. The basis on which the application was refused this time was  that  the
    appellant had not provided sufficient evidence that he  had  the  funds
    necessary for his maintenance under the requirements of the PBS.   This
    was because the respondent considered that the renewed application  was
    a fresh application, which had been made after the appellant's existing
    leave had expired.  For this reason, he could not be treated under  the
    Rules as  having an "established presence" and therefore  had  to  show
    that he had sufficient funds for his maintenance for the entire  period
    of the course, in addition to the funds necessary to pay that  part  of
    the tuition fees which was outstanding.  That meant that the  appellant
    had to demonstrate that he had available a total of �10,000, being nine
    months at �1,000 per month together with outstanding  tuition  fees  of
    �1,000.  It is agreed that if the appellant had been treated as  having
    an "established presence" (which he would have had if  the  application
    had been made while he had leave to remain) he would only have  had  to
    show that he had �,3000 available, being two months at �1,000 plus  the
    outstanding tuition fees of �1,000.  The  respondent  accepted  in  the
    refusal letter that  the  appellant  had  established  from  the  fixed
    deposit  certificate  submitted  with  his  application  that  he   had
    available to him �5,799.

 5. The appellant appealed against this decision, and his appeal  initially
    came  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Jessica  Pacey,  sitting  at
    Birmingham  on  27  March  2013,  for  the  purpose  of  determining  a
    preliminary issue on the papers.  The preliminary issue had  arisen  in
    this way. If the respondent had  been  entitled  to  treat  the  second
    application as a fresh application, the  appellant  would  not  have  a
    right of appeal, because he  would  not  lawfully  have  been  in  this
    country  at  the  time  the  application  was  made.  However  if   the
    application fell to  be  treated  as  merely  a  continuation   of  the
    original application, which had been made while the  appellant  was  in
    this country lawfully, then he would have a right of appeal. Directions
    had been given on 28 December 2012 that there should be  a  hearing  on
    this preliminary point which was how this  appeal  came  to  be  listed
    before Judge Pacey.

 6. Judge Pacey had regard to the  decision  of  this  Tribunal  in  Basnet
    (Validity of application - respondent) [2012] UKUT 00113, in which  the
    Tribunal had held that in circumstances where  the  respondent  asserts
    that an application was not accompanied by a fee, and so was not valid,
    the respondent had the burden of proving this.  The Tribunal in  Basnet
    had also held that the respondent's system of  processing  payments  of
    postal applications risked falling into  procedural  unfairness  unless
    other  measures  were  adopted,  and  that  the  appropriate   way   of
    considering whether in a particular case the respondent had established
    that the application had not been accompanied by a fee,  was  to  issue
    directions to  the  respondent  to  provide  information  to  determine
    whether or not this application had been  accompanied by the fee.

 7. In accordance with the guidance given in Basnet, Judge  Pacey  directed
    that the appeal should be relisted for a direction on the papers in  21
    days, but that the respondent should lodge with the Tribunal and  serve
    on the appellant any information on which she intended to rely  showing
    that the correct fee had not been  paid.   Judge  Pacey  noted  in  her
    decision that the respondent had not ticked any of  the  boxes  on  the
    standard letter which would have given further details as to how it was
    said that the fee had not been paid, and that accordingly the appellant
    had not been given a chance to address this issue.

 8. Subsequently, after the 21 days specified in Judge Pacey's  order,  but
    before the appeal came before the Tribunal for  further  consideration,
    the respondent notified the First-tier Tribunal that she was unable  to
    specify how it was that the fee came to be not paid because the records
    containing such information were not retained beyond six  months.   The
    appeal was then listed for hearing on the papers and came before First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Mogridge, sitting at Birmingham on 10 May 2013.

 9. In a determination promulgated on 24 May 2013, Judge Mogridge dismissed
    the appellant's appeal.  Insofar as the appellant had also purported to
    make a simultaneous decision to remove the appellant under  Section  47
    of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act  2006,  following  the
    decision in "Ahmadi etc", Judge Mogridge  found  this  decision  to  be
    invalid, and directed that it should be remitted to the respondent.

10. Notwithstanding that the respondent had not provided the evidence which
    she had been directed to supply by Judge  Pacey,  and  that,  following
    Basnet the respondent had the burden of establishing that the  specific
    fee had not been paid, Judge Mogridge still  found  that  the  original
    application had been  invalid.  Her reasons are set out at paragraphs 5
    to 7 of her determination as follows:

         "5.  The hearing of this appeal on the papers began  on  27.03.2013
             and was adjourned on Direction that the respondent specify how
             it was that the fee came to be not  paid  in  order  that  the
             appellant could properly address the  issue.   The  respondent
             responded by letter dated 08.05.2013 that she was unable to do
             this because records  containing  such  information  were  not
             retained beyond 6 months.

         6.   It seems to me from both the appellant's grounds of appeal  at
             p.16 of his bundle (para. 9) and   his  witness  statement  at
             p.12 of his further bundle (para. 9) that the  appellant  knew
             how it was that fee came to  be  not  paid,  namely  that  the
             respondent could not  withdraw  the  money  from  the  account
             given.

         7.   I'm afraid my view is that it was for the appellant to  ensure
             that adequate funds were in place to meet the fee payment.  He
             did not do so at the time of his initial application.   It  is
             clearly stated in the respondent's letter of acknowledgment of
             the application dated 03.07.2012 that if there was  'an  issue
             with the fee ... the application will be rejected'.  There was
             an issue, namely that the respondent could not obtain  payment
             of the fee, and the application was rejected.  The appellant's
             application  was  only  made  by  his  second  application  on
             17.08.2012 which was after expiry of his leave to remain."

11. Judge Mogridge then went on to find at paragraph 8 that  the  appellant
    therefore did not have a right of appeal and the appeal was dismissed.

12. The appellant has  appealed  against  this  decision  and  was  granted
    permission to appeal by First-tier Tribunal Judge Frances  on  13  June
    2013.  In giving her reasons for granting permission to  appeal,  Judge
    Frances stated as follows:

         "2.  The grounds  submit that the judge failed to  have  regard  to
             the decision  of First-tier Tribunal Judge  J  S  Pacey  dated
             27th March 2013.  The burden of proof was on the respondent to
             show why the fee had note been paid following Basnet (validity
             of application - respondent) [2012]  UKUT  00113.   The  judge
             erred in law in finding that the appellant's  application  was
             only made by  his  second  application  after  his  leave  had
             expired.

         3.   The judge took into account  the  previous  decision  and  the
             respondent's evidence that she was unable to specify  why  the
             fee was  not paid because records containing such  information
             were not retained beyond six months. It is arguable  that  the
             judge erred in law in failing to  apply  the   correct  burden
             of proof and misinterpreted the appellant's  evidence  in  his
             grounds  of  appeal  and  witness  statement.  The   appellant
             maintained he had sufficient  funds  in  his  account.  It  is
             arguable that the respondent has failed to show otherwise. ...
             ."

13. The appeal was then listed for an oral  hearing at Field  House  before
    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Davidge, on 23 July 2013, but the appellant
    did not attend.  Judge Davidge considered that the  appellant  had  not
    wished to attend (taking into account that previously he had asked  for
    the appeal to be dealt with on the papers)  and  so  continued  in  his
    absence.  However, it subsequently  appeared  that  the  appellant  had
    wished to be here and had made an application for an  adjournment,  but
    this application had not been  put before the judge.  Accordingly,  the
    appeal was relisted for  hearing before me on 30 September 2013.





The Hearing

14.  Before me, again the appellant did not attend and was not represented.
     The respondent was represented by Ms Pal, who considered that it might
    be the case that the  appellant  had  already  left  the  jurisdiction,
    because his course  had  ended  in  July  2013,  although  she  had  no
    information to this effect.  I ascertained that the appellant had  been
    notified of the hearing, and considered that I could justly  deal  with
    this appeal in the absence of the appellant and proceeded to do so.  As
    I make clear below, in fact the appellant was, unknown to the Tribunal,
    present in the building at the time, but was not present at the hearing
    due to a misunderstanding for which he was not at fault.   However,  in
    the circumstances that are set out below, this did not  result  in  any
    prejudice to the appellant.

15. On behalf of the  respondent,  Ms  Pal  set  out  what  the  respondent
    considered was the factual background of this  appeal.   The  appellant
    had made an application for further leave to remain at a time  when  he
    was still here lawfully, but although the respondent had  attempted  to
    take payment, this  was  rejected.   The  appellant  had  then  made  a
    subsequent application after his  leave  had  expired.   Although  this
    application  was  accompanied  by  the  correct  fee,  it  was  refused
    essentially because he did not have an "established  presence"  because
    his leave had by then expired.

16. On behalf of the respondent, Ms Pal accepted that  the  precedent  fact
    regard the taking (or rather inability to take) the payment had  to  be
    established by the respondent, but the appropriate records had not been
    kept because these records were only kept for six month.   Ms  Pal  did
    not know why this was the case.

17. In answer to a question from the Tribunal as  to  whether  this  was  a
    satisfactory procedure, because  the  respondent  must  be  aware  that
    records would often be required after six months had  elapsed,  Ms  Pal
    asserted that the appellant had not even produced a bank  statement  to
    show that the payment would have gone through if the  cheque  had  been
    presented.  In those circumstances it was suggested  that  the  judge's
    decision had been  open to her.

18. However, in answer to a further question  from  the  Tribunal,  Ms  Pal
    accepted that following the decision in Basnet, the burden of proof  in
    this case was on the respondent and that the respondent  had  not  been
    able to discharge this.  However, the appellant  would  still  need  to
    show that he had adequate funds in order to satisfy the requirements of
    the Rules.  The judge did not refer to any evidence  of  funds  in  her
    determination, although in the grounds  of  appeal  the  appellant  had
    raised an issue that he had �5,700 odd in an account.

19. In answer to a further question from the Tribunal, Ms Pal accepted that
    as the respondent had not established precedent  facts,  the  appellant
    did have a right of appeal against the refusal.

20. Ms Pal also accepted that as the respondent had  not  established  that
    the rejection of the application for administrative reasons was correct
    (as per Basnet) he would only have needed to show that he had the lower
    amount of funds available, that is  two  months'  maintenance  (�2,000)
    plus the outstanding tuition fees (another �1,000) which was �3,000  in
    all.

21. Having considered the issues further, Ms Pal accepted that she would be
    in difficulty contesting this approach.

Discussion

22. Having considered the arguments advanced on behalf of the respondent, I
    was  entirely  satisfied  that  Judge  Mogridge's   determination   had
    contained an error of law such that her decision must be set aside  and
    re-made by the Upper Tribunal.  My reasons can  be  stated  shortly  as
    follows:

23. As was made clear by this Tribunal in Basnet, the burden of  proof  was
    on the respondent to establish that the original  application  had  not
    been accompanied by the correct payment. As accepted on behalf  of  the
    respondent, the respondent has not established this.  I do not consider
    the reasons advanced, that records are only kept for six months, at all
    satisfactory.  Appeals are frequently heard more than six months  after
    an application has been made, and as made clear  by  this  Tribunal  in
    Basnet, it is for the  respondent  to  ensure  that  she  keeps  proper
    records.  It is worth reminding the respondent of what was said by this
    Tribunal at paragraph 29 of Basnet as follows:

         "We recognise that there are good security reasons  for  destroying
         financial information that could  fall  into  wrong  hands  and  be
         abused, but we see no reason why a system cannot  be  devised  that
         permits secure retention of data pending resolution of any  dispute
         about whether accurate billing data has been supplied".

24. At paragraph 28 of Basnet, the Tribunal had set out a number of reasons
    why payment might fail, some of  which would not have been   the  fault
    of an applicant, but could  be the fault of the respondent.

25. In these circumstances, given the respondent's failure in this case  to
    set out the basis upon which the payment had been refused, it was  not,
    in my judgment, properly open to Judge Mogridge  to  make  the  finding
    which she did at paragraph 7 that the appellant had  not  ensured  that
    adequate funds were in place to meet the fee payment.  Contrary to what
    Judge Mogridge understood the appellant to be saying at para 9  of  his
    witness statement (that he knew that the respondent had been  unable to
    withdraw money from the account given) that is not  in  fact  what  the
    appellant stated. He said at paragraph 9 that the respondent had stated
    (my emphasis) that the application was invalid because  she  could  not
    withdraw the money towards the application fee, but went on to  say  at
    paragraph 10 that he had had enough funds in his account at that  time,
    of which he enclosed proof with his appeal documents.  In my  judgment,
    it is accordingly clear that  the  respondent  had  not  satisfied  the
    burden of proof which was on her and that accordingly  the  appellant's
    appeal should have been  considered on the basis that the relevant date
    of  the  application  was  when  the  original  application  had   been
    submitted, at which time, it is accepted, he did have  an  "established
    presence" in this country, because he still had  lawful  permission  to
    remain.

26. Accordingly I proceeded to re-make the decision on the basis first that
    the appellant did have a right of appeal (as  effectively  accepted  on
    behalf of the respondent by Ms Pal) and also that  because  he  had  an
    established presence at the time the  application  was  made,  he  only
    needed to show that he had a total of �3,000 available to him.

27. As the respondent accepted in the letter of refusal that he  had  above
    this sum (and Ms Pal did not seek  to  challenge  this  before  me)  it
    follows that the maintenance requirement was in fact  met,  and,  there
    being no other basis upon which  this  application  could  properly  be
    refused, this appeal must be allowed, and I will so find.

Matters subsequent to the Hearing

28. I should record that after I had  informed  Ms  Pal,  representing  the
    respondent, that I intended to allow the appeal, and had risen,  I  was
    told that the appellant had in fact been present in the  building,  but
    had not come into the hearing, due to  a  misunderstanding,  the  exact
    circumstances of which it is not necessary to record, other  than  that
    this does not seem to  have been his fault in any way.   I  accordingly
    agreed to  reconvene  briefly  in  order  to  inform  him  that  I  had
    considered the appeal in his absence, and  had  decided  to  allow  the
    appeal.

Decision

29. I set aside the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Mogridge  as
    containing a  material  error  of  law  and  substitute  the  following
    decision:

30. The appellant's appeal is allowed, under the Immigration Rules.
