Representation:
For  the  Appellant:      [Counsel],  of   Counsel,   instructed   by   [the
                       Solicitors].
For the Respondent:    Ms. S. Ong, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.

The costs of a supplier or any counsel may only be excluded from  a  funding
order in special circumstances.  This  is  so  whether  regulation  8(2)  or
regulation 8(2B) of the Community  Legal  Service  (Asylum  and  Immigration
Appeals) Regulations 2005 (as amended) applies.  The  special  circumstances
must relate to the reasons for excluding the  costs  of  a  supplier/counsel
(as the case may be) whilst including the costs of another  supplier/counsel
in the order.


                            FUNDING DETERMINATION


1.    [In order to anonymise this determination, the details of  the  appeal
     are not reported]
2.
3.
4.

5.    At the hearing on 14 June 2007,  Counsel  requested  the  Tribunal  to
     issue a  funding  order.  The  Tribunal  had  earlier  drawn  Counsel's
     attention to the fact that the Solicitors had failed to  serve  several
     documents which were being relied upon by the Appellant for the second-
     stage reconsideration hearing. We identify at paragraph  22  below  the
     documents and bundles which were served by  the  Solicitors  and  those
     which were copied by the Tribunal itself, so  that  the  hearing  could
     proceed. In addition, in the bundle submitted by the  Solicitors  which
     we numbered bundle number 4, item 10 was intended to include a document
     relating to "Abeyi, the A's home region". Three copies of bundle 4  had
     been served on the Tribunal. However, two  of  these  bundles  did  not
     match the remaining  one  because  the  index  for  these  two  bundles
     described item 10 as "Documents in respect  of  Labado,  the  A's  home
     region" and the document at pages 159 to 178 of that bundle related  to
     Labado and not Abeyi. The third (and remaining) copy of  bundle  4  was
     correct.

6.    Such was the state of the documents  and  bundles  that  there  was  a
     significant danger of the  Tribunal  overlooking  documentary  evidence
     which was relevant to the appeal.  The  Tribunal  was  faced  with  the
     prospect of either adjourning the hearing so that complete and accurate
     bundles could be prepared and submitted, or giving Counsel some time to
     check all the documents and  to  confirm  that  we  had  at  least  one
     complete set. It was  only  possible  to  do  the  latter  because  the
     Tribunal had, prior to  the  hearing  date,  taken  the  precaution  of
     copying on its own volition the bundles and documents which appeared to
     the  Tribunal  to  be  missing  from  the  bundles  submitted  by   the
     Solicitors. We then requested that Counsel check every page  to  ensure
     that the pages included in the bundles matched the index at the  front.
     Counsel informed us that he would telephone the Solicitors and  attempt
     to obtain an explanation for the poor preparation of the bundles.

7.    When we reconvened, Counsel informed us that  he  had  telephoned  the
     Solicitors, who had informed him  that,  in  their  view,  it  was  the
     Tribunal which must have mixed up the Appellant's  bundle  4  with  the
     bundles submitted by them in connection with another Sudanese appeal in
     which they had also been instructed. The Tribunal informed Counsel that
     this did not explain why several other documents which were relied upon
     had not been served by the Solicitors (see column (2) at  paragraph  22
     below and paragraphs 25 and 26 below). Counsel informed us that he  had
     no explanation. It was at this point that Counsel submitted the  second
     (undated) letter from the Appellant's doctor (Dr. Jenkins).

8.    At the end of the hearing, Counsel informed the Tribunal that  he  had
     been instructed to request a funding order. We informed him to  request
     the Solicitors to  explain  why  they  had  failed  to  serve  all  the
     documents relied upon and why two copies of the  Appellant's  bundle  4
     contained a document belonging to  another,  different,  appellant.  We
     said we would give the Solicitors five days  in  which  to  respond  in
     writing. We  made it clear that, whilst we did  not  wish  to  question
     whether Counsel's fees should be paid out  of  the  relevant  fund  (as
     defined in rule 33 of the Procedure Rules), we required an  explanation
     from the Solicitors before we would order their costs to be paid out of
     the relevant fund.

9.    On 21 June 2007, the Tribunal received a letter from  the  Solicitors,
     to which we will refer below.

10.   The relevant statutory provisions are set out in section 103D  of  the
     Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as amended (the 2002 Act),
     rules 28A and 33 of the Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)
     Rules 2005 (the  Procedure  Rules)  and  the  Community  Legal  Service
     (Asylum and Immigration  Appeals)  Regulations  2005  as  amended  with
     effect from 30 April 2007 by the Community Legal  Service  (Asylum  and
     Immigration Appeals) (Amendment)  Regulations  2007  (the  amended  CLS
     Regulations). Paragraph 15 of the Practice Directions as amended on  30
     April 2007 is also relevant. We will refer to these where necessary.

11.   The power to make an order that an appellant's costs be  paid  out  of
     the relevant fund is set out in section 103D of the 2002  Act.  Section
     103D (1), (2) and (3) provide:

      "(1)  On the application of  an  appellant  under  section  103A,  the
           appropriate court  may  order  that  the  appellant's  costs  in
           respect of the application under section 103A shall be paid  out
           of the Community Legal Service Fund established under section  5
           of the Access to Justice Act 1999 (c.22).

      (2)   Subsection (3) applies where an  order  for  reconsideration  is
           made -

            (a)  under section 103A(1), and
            (b)  on the application of the appellant.

      (3)   The  Tribunal  may  order  payment  out  of  that  Fund  of  the
      appellant's costs -

            (a)  in respect of the application for reconsideration;
            (b)  in respect of the preparation for reconsideration;
            (c)  in respect of the reconsideration;"

12.   Regulation 6 of the amended CLS Regulations provides:

      "6    (1)  The Tribunal must exercise  the  power  to  make  an  order
           under section 103D(3) in accordance with this regulation.

            (IA) The Tribunal may only make an order under  section  103D(3)
           where-
                 (a)   it has reconsidered its decision on an appeal; or
                 (b)   an order for reconsideration has been  made  but  the
                 reconsideration does not take place  or  is  not  completed
                 because:-
                       (i)   the appeal lapses, or is treated  as  abandoned
                       or finally determined, by operation of an  enactment;
                       or
                       (ii)  the appeal is withdrawn by  the  appellant,  or
                       is  treated  as  withdrawn  because  the   respondent
                       withdraws the  decision  or  decision  to  which  the
                       appeal relates.

            (2)  If the Tribunal allows an  appeal  on  reconsideration,  it
           must make an order under section 103D(3).

            (3)  If the Tribunal dismisses an appeal on reconsideration,  it
           must not make an order under section  103D(3)  unless  satisfied
           that, at the time when  the  appellant  made  the  section  103A
           application, there was a significant prospect  that  the  appeal
           would be allowed upon reconsideration.

             (3A)  If  an  order  for  reconsideration  is  made   but   the
           reconsideration does not take place or  is  not  completed,  the
           Tribunal must not make an order under section 103D(3) unless  it
           is satisfied that, at the  time  when  the  appellant  made  the
           section 103A application, there was a significant prospect  that
           the appeal would be allowed upon reconsideration.

            (4)  If, where paragraph  (3)  or  (3A)  applies,  the  Tribunal
           decides not to make an order under section 103D(3), it must give
           reasons for its decision."

13.   In RS (Funding - meaning of 'significant prospect') Iran [2005]  UKAIT
     00138, the  Tribunal  gave  guidance  on  the  meaning  of  the  phrase
     "significant prospect". The Tribunal in that  case  held,  inter  alia,
     that, in the majority of cases:

      (a)    there  is  no  material  difference  between  the  "significant
           prospect" test for the issue of a  section  103D  funding  order
           under regulation 6(3) and the "real possibility" test under rule
           26(6) before reconsideration can be ordered under the  Procedure
           Rules (paragraph 16 of the determination); and

      (b)   the initial views of the Senior Immigration  Judge  who  ordered
           reconsideration should be regarded as  the  decisive  factor  in
           determining whether the funding order should be made within  the
           terms of regulation 6(3) (paragraph 18 of the determination).

14.   In RS, the Tribunal went on to give four examples of  cases  in  which
     the preliminary view  of  the  Senior  Immigration  Judge  who  ordered
     reconsideration may need to be revisited for the purposes of deciding a
     funding order  application.  In  DM  (Timing  of  funding  application)
     Zimbabwe [2006] UKAIT 00088, the Tribunal gave guidance as  to  whether
     there is a prescriptive time limit for an application to be made for  a
     funding order and whether there is a requirement for an explanation for
     any delay in making an application for a funding order. These issues do
     not concern us in the instant case. This is because  we  are  satisfied
     that, at the time the application for reconsideration was  made,  there
     was a significant prospect  that  the  appeal  would  be  allowed  upon
     reconsideration. We are so satisfied having regard  to  the  fact  that
     Neuberger LJ ordered the Tribunal to reconsider its decision  and  that
     the Tribunal at the first stage of the reconsideration on 6  June  2006
     concluded that the Immigration  Judge  had  materially  erred  in  law,
     particularly with reference to Dr. Bell's report (see item 7 in  bundle
     1 in paragraph 22 below), and ordered a reconsideration on  the  merits
     with all issues at large. The outcome of the reconsideration ultimately
     turned on credibility. The fact that the Appellant was ultimately found
     not credible is not relevant  to  the  question  whether  there  was  a
     significant prospect, at the time  the  section  103A  application  was
     made, that the Appellant's appeal would be allowed.

15.   Nevertheless, in our view, the Tribunal  retains  a  discretion  under
     regulation 6(3) to refuse to make a  funding  order.  If  it  had  been
     intended not to confer on the Tribunal a discretion to refuse to make a
     funding order in the case of appeals which are  dismissed  and  if  the
     only criteria for the making of a funding order is whether the Tribunal
     is satisfied that, at the time of the application for  reconsideration,
     there was a significant prospect that the appeal would  be  allowed  on
     reconsideration, then it  would  have  been  an  easy  matter  for  the
     draftsman  to  have  written  regulation  6(3)  in  a  way  similar  to
     regulation 6(2), by the use of the  word  "must".  The  fact  that  the
     draftsman chose not to do so is a very strong indication that the  fact
     that there was a significant prospect, at the time the application  for
     reconsideration  was  made,  that  the  appeal  would  be  allowed   on
     reconsideration is not determinative.

16.    In  this  determination,  we  do  not  give  guidance   as   to   the
     circumstances in which it would be  appropriate  for  the  Tribunal  to
     refuse to make a funding order under regulation 6(3). That may need  to
     be considered on another occasion. In  the  instant  case,  and  having
     regard  to  the  fact  that   neither   Counsel   nor   [the   previous
     representatives] have given the Tribunal any cause for concern in their
     preparation or handling of the case, we exercise our discretion to make
     a funding order.

17.   However, we have concerns as to the preparation of this  case  by  the
     Solicitors, as explained below. Accordingly, we turn to regulation 8 to
     consider whether this permits the Tribunal to make a funding order on a
     limited basis, i.e. to order that only Counsel's fees and the costs  of
     [the previous representatives] are to be paid out of the relevant  fund
     (as defined in rule 33 of the Procedure Rules).

18.   Regulation 8 of the amended CLS Regulations provides:

      "8.   (1)  Subject to paragraph (2), a section 103D order  shall  have
            effect as an order for payment  of  all  costs  incurred  by  a
            supplier representing the appellant in the proceedings to which
            the order relates, including the fees of counsel instructed  by
            the supplier, for which payment is allowable under the terms of
            the contract between the Commission and the supplier.

            (2)   In  relation  to  proceedings  in  which  a  supplier  has
            instructed counsel, the High  Court  or  the  Tribunal  may  in
            special circumstances make a section 103D order-

                 (a)   in respect of counsel's fees only; or

                 (b)   in respect of the  costs  incurred  by  the  supplier
                 excluding counsel's fees.

            (2A) Where paragraph (2) applies  the  High  Court  or  Tribunal
            must give reasons for its decision.

            (2B) Where an appellant has been represented by  more  than  one
            supplier or more than one counsel in the course of  immigration
            review proceedings, a  section  103D  order  shall,  unless  it
            provides otherwise, have effect as an order for the payment  of
            the costs incurred by each supplier and of  the  fees  of  each
            counsel while he was instructed to represent the  appellant  in
            the proceedings."

      Regulation 3 is the interpretation provision.  We  have  set  out  the
     definitions of "supplier" and "contract" above.  Regulation  3  defines
     "counsel" as "a barrister in independent practice".

19.   In cases in which there is one supplier only  and  that  supplier  has
     not instructed counsel, then if the Tribunal decides to make a  section
     103D order, that order will relate to all of the costs of the supplier,
     whether they relate to the application itself, or the  preparation  for
     the reconsideration or the reconsideration. This is because  regulation
     8(1) does not make any provision to limit the section 103D order so  as
     to allow the payment of part only  of  the  supplier's  costs.  If  the
     supplier has instructed  counsel,  then  regulation  8(2)  permits  the
     Tribunal, in special circumstances, to make a section 103D order so  as
     to limit the order to counsel's fees only or the costs of the  supplier
     excluding  counsel.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  Tribunal  has  a
     discretion to make an order on such a limited  basis.  This  discretion
     must be exercised judicially. Regulation 8 (2A) requires  the  Tribunal
     to give reasons for making an order on a limited basis, as provided for
     in regulation 8(2). As with regulation 8(1), regulation 8(2)  does  not
     make any provision which would enable the Tribunal to limit the section
     103D order so as to allow the payment of part only  of  the  supplier's
     costs, or part only of counsel's fees.

20.   The Tribunal's power to make a section 103D order on a  limited  basis
     in cases in which there is more than one  supplier  or  more  than  one
     counsel is governed by regulation  8(2B).  The  wording  of  regulation
     8(2B) is slightly different from that of  regulation  8(1).  Regulation
     8(1) provides that a section 103D order shall have effect as stated  in
     regulation 8(1)  "subject  to  paragraph  (2)",  i.e.  subject  to  the
     provisions of regulation 8(2), whereas regulation 8(2B) provides that a
     section 103D order shall have effect  as  provided  in  that  paragraph
     "unless it [the section 103D order]  provides  otherwise".  The  second
     difference is that regulation  8(1)  relates  to  "all  costs  incurred
     ....... in  the  proceedings  to  which  the  order  relates",  whereas
     regulation 8(2B) relates  to  "costs  incurred  by  each  supplier  and
     ....... fees of each counsel while he was instructed to  represent  the
     appellant in the proceedings" (our emphasis). The third  difference  is
     that, under regulation 8(2), a section 103D order may only be  made  if
     there are special circumstances, whereas regulation 8(2B) does not make
     any reference to  "special  circumstances":  the  phrase  "unless  [the
     order] provides  otherwise"  do  not  appear  to  provide  for  such  a
     limitation on the ability of the Tribunal to make a section 103D  order
     on a limited basis. With these differences, regulation 8(2B) appears to
     cover identical ground as regulation 8(1) for single  suppliers.  Where
     regulation 8(1)  applies,  the  inroads  into  a  universal  order  are
     governed by regulation 8(2). Where regulation 8(2B)  applies,  however,
     there is no specific restriction on the terms of an order: the  wording
     of the regulation is simply  "unless  it  [i.e.  the  order]  otherwise
     provides...." That, in our  view,  is  to  avoid  complication  in  the
     drafting. Any limitations on the Tribunal's ability to make  a  limited
     order in cases falling under regulation 8(1) should also apply to cases
     falling under regulation 8(2B); there is no  logical  reason  why  they
     should not apply. We have therefore concluded that, notwithstanding the
     use of the words "unless [the order] provides otherwise", there  is  no
     power under regulation 8(2B) to make a section  103D  order  so  as  to
     allow for the payment of part only of one  supplier's  costs,  or  part
     only of the fees of any particular counsel.  However,  consistent  with
     cases governed by regulation 8(2),  it  is  possible  under  regulation
     8(2B) to allow for the payment of the costs of  one  supplier  but  not
     another, or one counsel but not another.

21.   As with cases governed by  regulation  8(2),  there  must  be  special
     circumstances before a section 103D order on a limited  basis  is  made
     under regulation 8(2B) and reasons must be given for making  a  limited
     order. The phrase "special circumstances" in  regulation  8(2)  is  not
     defined. This will have to be decided on a case by case basis.  In  our
     view, there is a strong public interest  in  ensuring  that  cases  are
     properly prepared for hearing and that relevant documentary evidence is
     duly served on all parties. The  Tribunal  is  entitled  to  take  into
     account, in appropriate cases, the way in which a case has been handled
     or prepared for the hearing. It is not every case of poor case handling
     or preparation which would warrant the making of a funding order  on  a
     limited basis, under regulation 8(2)  or  8(2B).  In  the  majority  of
     cases, and having regard to the general time  constraints  under  which
     most representatives in this jurisdiction operate, the  Tribunal  would
     be very slow to proceed under regulation 8(2) or 8(2B). However, in our
     view, a very bad case of poor case handling or preparation  in  respect
     of a supplier who has instructed counsel who has discharged his  duties
     duly may amount to special circumstances  justifying  the  Tribunal  to
     make a funding order on a limited basis, in respect of counsel but  not
     in respect of the supplier. This does not encroach upon the  regulatory
     functions of the Immigration Services Commissioner  or  any  designated
     professional body. The Tribunal's role is complementary to  theirs,  as
     well as that of the Legal Services Commission. Parliament  cannot  have
     intended to compel the Tribunal to order that a costs of a qualified or
     an exempt person be paid out of the relevant fund, even in a  very  bad
     case of poor case handling or preparation. Besides the fact  that  such
     conduct may warrant a complaint being  made  by  the  Tribunal  to  the
     Immigration Services Commissioner or the appropriate professional body,
     it would be strange if the Tribunal were to make such a  complaint  but
     nevertheless be forced into ordering that the costs of the qualified or
     exempt person be paid out of the relevant fund.

22.   We turn now to the circumstances of this individual case. We have  set
     out at paragraph 7  of  the  principal  determination  the  documentary
     evidence in this case. For the purpose of the principal  determination,
     it was sensible to list all the documents of a particular type or  from
     a particular source together,  before  moving  on  to  documents  of  a
     different type or from a different source. For  the  purposes  of  this
     funding determination, it is necessary to set out the  documents  in  a
     different order, so that it is more  readily  apparent  what  documents
     have  been  served  by  the  Solicitors  for  the   purposes   of   the
     reconsideration hearing, and what have been omitted by them, as follows
     (the bundle numbers refer to the numbers assigned to the bundles by the
     Tribunal at the hearing on 14 June 2007):

       Bundle  4  (which  was  served  by  the  Solicitors)  also  contained
     background material of a general nature, which  Counsel  confirmed  had
     been overtaken by the Court of Appeal's  judgment  in  AH  (Sudan)  and
     Others v. SSHD [2007] EWCA Civ 297. There was also a bundle 5 which was
     served by the Solicitors, entitled "Case-law bundle". Counsel confirmed
     that the cases included in  that  bundle  had  been  overtaken  by  the
     judgment in the AH case. At the date when bundles 4 and 5 were  served,
     the judgment in the AH case had not been delivered. Therefore, one  can
     understand why these documents were included because bundles  4  and  5
     were served in March 2007 whereas the  judgment  in  the  AH  case  was
     delivered on 4 April  2007.  At  the  hearing,  Counsel  submitted  his
     skeleton argument and a newspaper article dated 21 May  2007  entitled:
     Darfur: United Nations Mission reports new round of clashes".

23.   As already noted, the Tribunal was only in  possession  of  bundles  1
     and 2 because of the efforts of the Tribunal itself in identifying,  at
     its own initiative and prior to the hearing date, the  documents  which
     appeared to be missing and in ensuring that sufficient copies were made
     for the use of panel  members.  The  Tribunal  cannot  be  expected  to
     perform this task. This is part of a representative's role. However, it
     is fortuitous that the Tribunal did arrange in advance for the  missing
     documents to be copied because the hearing  would  not  otherwise  have
     concluded on the day (see paragraph 31 below).

24.   The documents contained in bundle 1 were  first  served  on  22  March
     2005 in connection with the hearing of the  appeal  before  Immigration
     Judge Jhirad. Although the Appellant was represented at  that  time  by
     [the previous representatives], it was clear at the hearing on 14  June
     2007 that Counsel was familiar with the documents in bundles 1  and  2.
     He had been provided with these by the Solicitors.

25.   Leaving aside the chronology and the two maps in column  (1)  (on  the
     assumption that the chronology was not necessary,  nor  were  the  maps
     because  there  was  a  map  in  one  of  the  bundles  served  by  the
     Solicitors), the fact is that the Solicitors failed to serve  a  number
     of documents which were specific to the Appellant's  case  -  no  fewer
     than 12 documents. They were important documents in the context of this
     case. In giving his reasons for ordering the Tribunal to reconsider its
     decision, Neuberger LJ specifically referred to the report of Dr. Bell.
     He considered that there was a possibility  of  the  Immigration  Judge
     reaching a different conclusion if she had considered the  contents  of
     Dr. Bell's report instead of "attaching little weight to it". As stated
     above, the Tribunal subsequently decided, at the  first  stage  of  the
     reconsideration, that the Immigration Judge had materially erred in law
     by rejecting Dr. Bell's report on the  grounds  that  it  was  produced
     after a consultation of 1 � hours. Despite the  obvious  relevance  and
     importance of Dr. Bell's report, the Solicitors  failed  to  serve  it.
     Further, it is significant to see that they also failed to serve  other
     documents which were also important in this particular case - that is:

            -    two witness statements by the Appellant;
            -    three reports / letters from his social worker;
            -    the report of his Chartered Child Psychologist;
            -    the report of his adviser at Pathways to Independence;
            -    the letter from Union of the  People  of  Darfur  UK  &  N.
            Ireland, dealing with the factual issues which the Tribunal had
            to decide;
            -    the Appellant's membership card with this organisation.

      as well as the specific experts' reports to which we will now turn.

26.   Whilst the Solicitors did serve a report from Mr. Verney and a  report
     from Ms. Macguire (see items 7 and 8 in column (2) above), the contents
     of these were of a generic nature and did not  relate  specifically  to
     the Appellant's case. They failed to serve the reports from  these  two
     experts which had been prepared specifically for the  Appellant's  case
     (see items 9 and 10 in column (1)) and on which Counsel relied  at  the
     hearing. The letter  from  Ms.  Powling  dated  June  2006,  which  was
     referred  to  several  times  by  Counsel  at  the  hearing,  was  only
     discovered by the Tribunal on its file by chance on the hearing day.

27.   In respect of item 9 in column (2), three  copies  of  bundle  4  were
     submitted. Each had an index at  the  front.  This  document  was  item
     number 10 in the index for bundle 4. The Tribunal should have  been  in
     possession of three identical copies of bundle 4. It was not. Only  one
     bundle and one index was correct. Item 10 for that bundle reads:

                 "Documents in respect of "Abeyi" the A's home area."

28.   At pages 159 to 177 of this copy of bundle 4 was a document  entitled:
     "Protocol between the Government of the Sudan and  the  Sudan  People's
     Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) on the resolution of Abyei  conflict"
     dated 26 May 2004". This was the correct document. However, item 10  on
     the index of the remaining two copies of bundle 4 read:

                 "Documents in respect of Labado, the A's home area."

      and pages 159 to  178  of  these  two  bundles  contained  a  document
     relating to Labado which was entirely irrelevant to this appeal.

29.   By chance, the Tribunal discovered that the panel members'  copies  of
     bundle 4 were not identical. At that point, the Chairman handed all the
     documents which were in her possession to Counsel and requested Counsel
     to check each document and each page of each bundle to ensure that  the
     Tribunal was in possession of the correct documents and that it was  in
     possession of all the documents, explaining that the Tribunal  did  not
     wish to find itself in the position of having inadvertently  overlooked
     relevant evidence. Counsel said that, during the short adjournment,  he
     would telephone the Solicitors to find  out  the  reason  why  all  the
     documents had not been served. When the  hearing  re-convened,  Counsel
     informed us that the relevant caseworker at the Solicitors had informed
     him that the correct copies of bundle 4 had been served on the Tribunal
     and that, if the bundles were mixed up, this must be due  to  the  fact
     that similar bundles for another client (who was from Labado) had  also
     been served at the same time and that it must be the Tribunal which had
     mixed the bundles up for the two cases. We informed Counsel that,  even
     if this explanation was accepted, it does not touch upon the  remaining
     issue - i.e. the failure to serve several important documents  relating
     to this case.

30.   We have explained at paragraph 8 above the  circumstances  leading  to
     the receipt by the Tribunal on 21  June  2007  of  a  letter  from  the
     Solicitors. This letter only deals with item 10 of bundle  4.  In  this
     regard, the explanation is that the  Appellant's  case  was  previously
     listed for hearing on 15 March 2007 at  10.00  a.m  in  Court  81,  and
     another case was listed for hearing on the same day in the  same  court
     at 2.00 p.m. The Solicitors  contend  that  there  must  have  been  an
     inadvertent mix up by the Tribunal of the bundles for  the  two  cases.
     Even if this is accepted (which we are prepared to),  this  only  deals
     with one aspect of the difficulties we experienced with the documentary
     evidence; we specifically told Counsel that, in addition,  we  required
     an explanation for the failure to submit the documents listed in column
     (1) above. No explanation is given in this regard in  the  letter  from
     the Solicitors. We therefore assume that their failure to address  this
     issue on two occasions - i.e. via Counsel when he  telephoned  them  on
     the hearing day and in their letter of 21 June 2007 - means  that  they
     have no explanation, or none that would  stand  up  to  any  reasonable
     scrutiny. The failure to serve the documents described at paragraphs 25
     and 26 should be considered together with  the  fact  that,  after  the
     conclusion of the first-stage reconsideration and under  cover  of  the
     Notice of Reconsideration hearing dated 5 February 2007 (Ref:  AIT48b),
     the Tribunal issued directions to the parties that,  no  later  than  5
     working days  before  the  hearing  date,  witness  statements  of  the
     evidence to be called at the hearing were to be served, together with a
     paginated and indexed bundle of all documents to be relied  on  at  the
     hearing, including any expert evidence.

31.   It is plain from the principal determination in  this  case  that  the
     documents referred to in paragraphs 25 and 26 above formed an important
     part of the Appellant's case. Indeed,  they  formed  the  core  of  his
     explanations for the credibility issues in this case, and the  core  of
     his case that his return to Sudan would be  in  breach  of  the  Geneva
     Convention and his human rights. The reconsideration hearing on 14 June
     2007 ended just before 6.00 p.m. Accordingly, there would not have been
     sufficient time during the course  of  the  day  to  allow  Counsel  an
     opportunity to make copies of relevant documents to be relied upon, nor
     would there have been sufficient time for the Tribunal to arrange  this
     to be done. But for the fact that  the  Tribunal  had  made  copies  in
     advance of the hearing date on its own initiative, it would  have  been
     necessary to adjourn the hearing, or at least to adjourn it part-heard.



32.   For these reasons, we find that  the  failure  of  the  Solicitors  to
     serve a number of documents which are important in the context  of  the
     case as a whole (as described in paragraphs 25 and 26  above)  and  the
     fact that no blame can be attached to [the previous representatives] or
     to Counsel (who did his best in a bad situation to assist us) amount to
     "special circumstances" within regulation 8(2) entitling  the  Tribunal
     to make a funding  order  on  a  limited  basis,  i.e.  in  respect  of
     Counsel's fees and the costs of [the previous representatives] only.

33.   Decision:

      In accordance with regulation 8(2B) of the  amended  CLS  Regulations,
     we make a section 103D order on a limited basis, as follows:

      (a)   We order that the costs of the application  for  reconsideration
           (i.e. the costs of [the previous representatives] in making  the
           application for reconsideration) are  to  be  paid  out  of  the
           relevant fund, as defined in rule 33;

      (b)   We order that Counsel's fees (with respect to the costs  of  the
           preparation  for  reconsideration   and   the   costs   of   the
           reconsideration) are to be paid out of  the  relevant  fund,  as
           defined in rule 33.

      The costs incurred by the Solicitors are excluded.
