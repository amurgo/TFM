                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


The appellant is a citizen of Somalia, born on [ ] 1990. Following  a  grant
of permission to appeal against the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
allowing his  appeal,  on  Article  3  human  rights  grounds,  against  the
respondent's decision to refuse his protection and human rights  claims,  it
was found, at an error of law hearing on 19 June  2017,  that  the  Tribunal
had made errors of law in its decision and the decision was  set  aside,  to
the extent set out below. Directions were made for the decision  to  be  re-
made by the Upper Tribunal.

Background

The appellant is from the island of Chula in Somalia. He arrived in  the  UK
on 11 March 2007, at the age of 16 years, with  entry  clearance  to  settle
with his father, who had been  granted  refugee  status  in  February  2004,
following a successful appeal, as a member of the minority Bajuni clan, sub-
clan Alossi. The appellant was  granted  indefinite  leave  to  enter  as  a
refugee. On 11 July 2014 the appellant was convicted of  false  imprisonment
and sentenced, on 22 August 2014, to 66 months' imprisonment. On 28  October
2014  he  was  notified  of  his  liability  to  automatic  deportation   in
accordance with section 32(5) of the 2007 Act and on  10  February  2015  he
was served with a decision to make a deportation order under section  32(5).
The respondent also, in a letter of the same date, invited the appellant  to
seek  to  rebut  the  presumption  under  section  72  of  the  Nationality,
Immigration Act 2002 that he had been convicted of  a  particularly  serious
crime and constituted a danger to the community.


On  21  December  2015  the  appellant  was  notified  of  the  respondent's
intention to cease his refugee status under Article  1C(5)  of  the  Refugee
Convention and paragraph 339A of the immigration rules  on  the  basis  that
the circumstances in connection with which  he  had  been  recognised  as  a
refugee, namely on the basis of risk on return as a member of  the  minority
Bajuni clan, had  ceased  to  exist.  On  15  January  2016  the  respondent
notified the UNHCR of the same and invited a response,  which  was  received
in a letter dated 8 February 2016. In a decision  dated  27  July  2016  the
respondent decided to revoke the appellant's protection refugee  status  and
refused his human rights claim and maintained the decision to deport him.  A
deportation order was issued the same day pursuant to section 32(5)  of  the
2007 Act.

The respondent, in making that decision, considered that the  appellant  had
failed to rebut the presumption under section 72(2)  of  the  2002  Act  and
accordingly certified that the presumption applied to him, with  the  effect
that he was excluded from protection under the Refugee  Convention.  He  was
also excluded  from  humanitarian  protection  for  the  same  reasons.  The
respondent then went on to consider the issue  of  cessation  and  concluded
that the situation regarding minority clans, which was the basis upon  which
his  father  had  been  granted  refugee  status,  had  since  changed.  The
respondent considered that the appellant  could  choose  to  return  to  the
Bajuni islands or remain in Mogadishu, to where he  would  be  removed.  The
respondent  relied  on  the  country  guidance  in  MOJ  &  Ors  (Return  to
Mogadishu) (Rev 1) (CG) [2014] UKUT 442 in regard to  the  current  improved
situation in Mogadishu and considered that the appellant no longer  required
international protection on the basis of his  Bajuni  clan  membership.  The
respondent considered that the  appellant  would  be  able  to  relocate  to
Mogadishu and that he was no longer at risk of persecution or  ill-treatment
amounting to a breach of Article 3 of the  ECHR.  The  respondent  therefore
decided to revoke the appellant's refugee status. The respondent went on  to
consider Article 8 of the ECHR and concluded that the  appellant  could  not
meet the requirements in paragraph 399(a) and (b) or  399A  and  that  there
were no very compelling circumstances outweighing  the  public  interest  in
his deportation. The respondent found that the appellant could not meet  any
of the exceptions to automatic deportation in section 33 of the 2007 Act.

The appellant appealed against that decision. His appeal was heard by  Judge
Khan in the First-tier Tribunal on 7 February 2017  and  was  allowed  in  a
decision promulgated on 6 March 2017. It was noted that  the  appellant  had
been released from custody on 30 December 2016. The  judge  heard  from  the
appellant and his father. The judge  considered  the  circumstances  of  the
appellant's offending, was  not  impressed  with  his  evidence,  noted  the
seriousness of the index offence and concluded that he  posed  a  danger  to
the community and that the respondent had properly found that he had  failed
to rebut the presumption in section 72(2). With regard  to  risk  on  return
the judge considered  the  country  guidance  in  MOJ.  He  found  that  the
additional  background  information  and  country  reports  demonstrated   a
deterioration in the security situation in  Mogadishu.  He  considered  that
the appellant would not have access to financial  resources,  would  not  be
able to secure a livelihood in Mogadishu,  would  have  no  family  or  clan
support and that he would end up in the IDP camps where he would be at  real
risk of serious harm and/ or inhuman and degrading treatment  in  breach  of
Article 3. He allowed the appeal on human rights grounds.

The respondent sought permission to appeal  that  decision  on  the  grounds
that the judge had wrongly applied the findings of the country  guidance  in
MOJ, that he had too readily accepted the appellant's evidence  as  to  lack
of support when he had otherwise made adverse credibility  findings  against
him and that he had failed to give reasons why he could not  take  advantage
of the economic conditions in  Mogadishu  and  secure  a  livelihood  there.
Permission to appeal was granted on 20 April 2017.

There was no cross-appeal by the appellant seeking to challenge the  judge's
decision  under  the  Refugee  Convention  or  on  humanitarian   protection
grounds.

Following an error of law hearing on 19 June 2017, I upheld  the  First-tier
Tribunal's decision dismissing  the  appellant's  claim  under  the  Refugee
Convention  and  on  humanitarian  protection  grounds  but  set  aside  the
decision allowing the appeal on Article 3 grounds, as follows:

    "10. It was Mr Wilding's submission that the judge  had  conflated  the
    considerations of Article 15(c)  of  the  Qualification  Directive  and
    Article 3 of the ECHR and had failed to give full and proper reasons as
    to why the appellant would be at  Article  3  risk  in  Mogadishu.  The
    judge's finding as to a lack  of  clan  association  in  Mogadishu  was
    unreasoned and contrary to references made  by  UNHCR;  the  judge  had
    failed to consider the full extent of available financial resources; no
    reasons had been given as to why  the  appellant  could  not  secure  a
    livelihood, particularly since he  had  undertaken  a  motor  mechanics
    course in the UK; and the judge had failed to explain why the appellant
    could not access the economic opportunities available in Mogadishu.


    11. Ms Kotak submitted in response that the judge's conclusion  on  the
    lack of minority clan support was consistent with the country  guidance
    and that the judge had fully and properly applied the country  guidance
    and had considered and made findings on all relevant factors.


    12. I find myself in agreement with Mr Wilding's submissions as to  the
    adequacy of the judge's reasons for reaching the  conclusions  that  he
    did on the factors set out in the country guidance.  I  put  aside  the
    submissions that he made in relation to Said, given that that was not a
    matter raised in the grounds, but focus on the  judge's  assessment  of
    the appellant's circumstances in the context of MOJ. It was Ms  Kotak's
    submission that the judge had done everything that he was  required  to
    do in undertaking such an assessment, but I agree with Mr Wilding  that
    there is a lack of adequate reasoning in his conclusions. I also  agree
    with the respondent's assertion in the grounds that, having  found  the
    appellant to be an unimpressive witness, the judge  failed  to  explain
    why he simply accepted his evidence as to a lack of resources available
    to him in Mogadishu without a proper consideration of the same.


    13. The evidence before the judge was that the  appellant  had  various
    relatives in Canada and the evidence recorded in the  decision  in  his
    father's appeal at [9] was that one of those relatives had paid for his
    father's travel out of Somalia. Yet no consideration was given  by  the
    judge  to  whether  any  financial  assistance  was  available  to  the
    appellant from such sources if he found himself in  Mogadishu,  and  he
    focussed only on the lack of family in Somalia.  The  judge  found,  in
    regard to (ix) of the headnote to MOJ, that the appellant was unable to
    fund his journey to the west because he was  a  child,  yet  failed  to
    consider  how  the  journey  was,  nevertheless,  funded.  As  to   the
    appellant's ability to secure a livelihood, the  judge  found  that  he
    could not find work, but failed to  explain  why  that  was  the  case,
    stating simply at [42] that many of his educational qualifications were
    gained in prison. As  Mr  Wilding  said,  the  evidence  was  that  the
    appellant had undertaken a motor mechanics course  (at  [8]),  yet  the
    judge failed to give any consideration to opportunities available as  a
    result, in line with (x) of  the  headnote  to  MOJ,  and  appeared  to
    reverse the burden of proof suggested at (x).


    14. Accordingly it  seems  to  me  that  there  was  an  inadequacy  of
    reasoning on the judge's part in concluding that  the  appellant  would
    find himself destitute and subjected to harsh conditions in an IDP camp
    amounting to a breach of Article 3.


    15. There is a further matter which was not raised in the  respondent's
    grounds, but which  chimes  with  the  respondent's  assertion  in  the
    grounds that the judge's acceptance of  the  appellant's  evidence  was
    inconsistent with his previous  finding  that  the  appellant  had  not
    impressed him. I note that there appears to be an inconsistency in  the
    chronology relied upon by the judge at [42], which was taken  from  the
    appellant's witness statement and that of his father,  but  which  does
    not accord with the evidence recorded at [9],  [12]  and  [17]  of  the
    decision in the appellant's father's appeal. That was not considered by
    the judge when he accepted that the appellant had only lived in Somalia
    for two years and had not lived there since 1995, yet  is  relevant  to
    that claim. I would emphasise that that was not a matter raised  before
    me and therefore it does not form part of my overall  findings  on  the
    error of law, but is an observation that I make with a view to the  re-
    making of the decision.


    16. Accordingly, for the  reasons  given,  the  judge's  conclusion  on
    Article 3 risk on return is not sustainable and must be set aside.  The
    appeal will accordingly  be  listed  for  a  resumed  hearing  for  the
    decision to be re-made  and  any  submissions  on  the  effect  of  the
    decision in Said can be raised and  considered  at  that  hearing.  The
    judge's  findings  on  exclusion  are  preserved.  The  decision   will
    therefore be re-made on the question of risk of Article 3 ill-treatment
    on return to Mogadishu."

The following directions were made for the resumed hearing:

       "Not later than 14 days before the resumed hearing:

          a. The appellant or his  representatives  are  to  file  with  the
             Tribunal and serve upon the respondent an indexed and paginated
             bundle containing all documentary evidence relied upon.


          b. In respect of any witness who is to  be  called  to  give  oral
             evidence there must be a witness statement drawn in  sufficient
             detail to stand as evidence in chief filed  with  the  Tribunal
             and served upon the respondent. The appellant  and  his  father
             may wish to consider  addressing  the  matter  raised  at  [15]
             above.


          c. The appellant's representatives are to file with  the  Tribunal
             and serve upon the other party a skeleton argument setting  out
             all lines of argument to be pursued at the hearing."

Appeal hearing and submissions

The appeal then came before me for a resumed hearing on 31 August  2017,  to
re-make the decision on Article 3.

Although she acknowledged that it was not likely to  be  a  course  open  to
her,  Ms  Kotak  sought  nevertheless  to  re-open  the  decision   on   the
appellant's exclusion from the Refugee Convention. That  was  on  the  basis
that the expert evidence previously available, assessing  the  appellant  as
posing a low risk of re-offending, had been accorded little  weight  by  the
judge given that the appellant had been out  of  prison  for  only  a  short
period of time, whereas more time had since elapsed and  there  was  further
expert evidence of the low risk of re-offending and  evidence  showing  that
the appellant had changed. Ms Kotak submitted that if that issue were to  be
decided now, the exclusion decision would be  different  and  the  appellant
would still have refugee status. Ms Kotak accepted, however, that there  had
been no cross-appeal made with respect to the judge's findings on  exclusion
and on that basis I ruled that it was not open to the appellant  to  re-open
the matter. I accepted that she could argue  Article  8  in  regard  to  any
developments since the judge's decision.


The appellant then gave oral evidence before me. His father did  not  appear
as a witness but it was said that he had had  to  take  his  daughter  to  a
hospital  appointment  and  that  he  relied  upon  his  statements  as  his
evidence. The appellant adopted his earlier statement  of  24  January  2017
and a more recent undated statement prepared for this  appeal.  He  provided
details of his qualifications obtained in prison but said  that  they  would
not assist him finding employment in Somalia and that he would not  be  able
to find work there. He was  currently  supported  by  his  father  but  that
support consisted only of sharing his clothes and eating the  food  provided
for the family. His father did not give him any money and in fact  he  could
not afford a new mobile telephone since his previous  one  stopped  working.
His father would not be able to send any funds to him in Somalia. He had  no
other family in the UK or in Somalia. He  did  not  know  anything  about  a
cousin in Canada until recently when his appeal was being prepared.


In response to my questions the appellant said  that  his  father  had  four
children including him. The other  three  were  aged  six,  five  and  three
years. The appellant said that he had also  had  another  brother,  who  had
disappeared when they were living in the refugee camp. He said that he  left
Somalia when he was young, in 1994 or 1995. He  did  not  know  why  it  was
recorded in the decision in his father's appeal, in December 2003, that  his
father's two children were living in Somalia with an aunt.  He  was  not  in
Somalia at that time but was  living  with  his  grandmother,  his  father's
aunt, in Kenya. He lived in Kenya  for  six  to  seven  years  and  then  in
Tanzania for six years, before coming to the UK. His father paid for him  to
come to the UK.


Both  parties  made  submissions.  Ms  Aboni  submitted  that   there   were
inconsistencies in the evidence about the length of time the  appellant  had
been away from Somalia and it was not accepted that he  left  in  1995.  The
appellant could use the skills obtained in his various  courses  in  Somalia
and it was not accepted that his father  would  not  provide  him  with  any
funds as he had previously said that he would. The appellant had  failed  to
show  that  he  would  not  be  able  to  take  advantage  of  the  economic
opportunities in Mogadishu, as referred to in MOJ. He would  not  be  forced
to live in an IDP camp and would not be at risk on return to  Mogadishu.  Ms
Aboni relied on the case of Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  v
Said [2016] EWCA Civ 442 in submitting  that  the  appellant  would  not  be
forced into living in conditions in breach of Article 3 or  8  of  the  ECHR
even if he ended up in an IDP camp.


Ms Kotak submitted that the appellant's evidence should  be  accepted.  Said
could not be relied upon in relation to its findings on Article 3 in  regard
to IDP camps. Ms Kotak relied upon the expert report from Dr Markus  Hoehne,
whose expertise had been  accepted  in  MOJ,  and  who  concluded  that  the
appellant would not be able to find employment  in  Mogadishu  and  that  he
would be subjected to violence. The appellant would end up in  an  IDP  camp
in conditions contrary to Article 3. Even if the  threshold  for  Article  3
was not reached, there were very significant obstacles  to  the  appellant's
integration in Mogadishu, due to the humanitarian  crisis.  His  removal  to
Somalia would be disproportionate  and  in  breach  of  Article  8.  He  had
changed and posed a low risk of  re-offending.  Ms  Kotak  relied  upon  the
further expert report from Lisa Davies. She  submitted  that  the  appellant
was accessing  rehabilitation  services.  He  worked  with  street  homeless
people and enjoyed that work. The appeal should be allowed on  human  rights
grounds.

Consideration and findings.

The decision in the appellant's appeal is being re-made on the  question  of
risk on return to Mogadishu. It is relevant to set out the relevant  factors
set out in the headnote to MOJ, as follows.

    "(ii)               Generally, a person who is "an  ordinary  civilian"
    (i.e. not associated with the security forces; any aspect of government
    or official administration or any NGO or international organisation) on
    returning to Mogadishu after a period of absence will face no real risk
    of persecution or risk of harm such  as  to  require  protection  under
    Article 3 of the ECHR or Article 15(c) of the Qualification  Directive.
    In particular, he will not be at real risk simply on account of  having
    lived in a European location for a period of time of being viewed  with
    suspicion either by the authorities  as  a  possible  supporter  of  Al
    Shabaab or by Al Shabaab  as  an  apostate  or  someone  whose  Islamic
    integrity has been compromised by living in a Western country.

    (iii)             There has been durable change in the sense  that  the
    Al Shabaab withdrawal from Mogadishu is complete and there is  no  real
    prospect of a re-established presence within the city. That was not the
    case at the time of the country guidance given by the Tribunal in AMM.

    (iv)             The  level  of  civilian  casualties,  excluding  non-
    military casualties that clearly fall within Al Shabaab  target  groups
    such as politicians, police officers, government  officials  and  those
    associated  with  NGOs  and  international  organisations,  cannot   be
    precisely established by the statistical evidence which  is  incomplete
    and unreliable. However, it is established by the  evidence  considered
    as a whole that there has been a reduction in  the  level  of  civilian
    casualties since 2011, largely due to the cessation of  confrontational
    warfare within the city and Al Shabaab's resort to asymmetrical warfare
    on carefully selected targets.  The present level  of  casualties  does
    not amount to a sufficient  risk  to  ordinary  civilians  such  as  to
    represent an Article 15(c) risk.

    (v)               It is open to an ordinary  citizen  of  Mogadishu  to
    reduce further still his personal exposure to the risk  of  "collateral
    damage" in being caught up  in  an  Al  Shabaab  attack  that  was  not
    targeted at him by avoiding areas and establishments that  are  clearly
    identifiable as likely Al Shabaab targets, and it is  not  unreasonable
    for him to do so.

    (vi)             There is no real risk  of  forced  recruitment  to  Al
    Shabaab for  civilian  citizens  of  Mogadishu,  including  for  recent
    returnees from the West.

    (vii)           A person returning  to  Mogadishu  after  a  period  of
    absence will look to his nuclear family, if he has one  living  in  the
    city,  for  assistance  in  re-establishing  himself  and  securing   a
    livelihood. Although a returnee may also seek assistance from his  clan
    members who are not close relatives, such help is  only  likely  to  be
    forthcoming for majority clan  members,  as  minority  clans  may  have
    little to offer.

    (viii)         The significance of clan  membership  in  Mogadishu  has
    changed. Clans now provide, potentially, social support mechanisms  and
    assist with access to livelihoods,  performing  less  of  a  protection
    function than previously. There are no clan militias in  Mogadishu,  no
    clan violence, and no clan based  discriminatory  treatment,  even  for
    minority clan members.

    (ix)              If it is accepted that a person facing  a  return  to
    Mogadishu after a period of absence has  no  nuclear  family  or  close
    relatives in the city to  assist  him  in  re-establishing  himself  on
    return, there will need to be  a  careful  assessment  of  all  of  the
    circumstances. These considerations will include, but are  not  limited
    to:

         �       circumstances in Mogadishu before departure;
         �       length of absence from Mogadishu;
         �       family or clan associations to call upon in Mogadishu;
         �       access to financial resources;
         �        prospects  of  securing  a  livelihood,  whether  that  be
    employment or self employment;
         �       availability of remittances from abroad;
         �       means of support  during  the  time  spent  in  the  United
    Kingdom;
         �       why his ability to fund the journey to the West  no  longer
         enables an appellant to secure
             financial support on return


    (x)               Put another way, it will be  for  the  person  facing
    return to explain why he would not  be  able  to  access  the  economic
    opportunities that have been produced by the economic boom,  especially
    as there is evidence to the effect that returnees are  taking  jobs  at
    the expense of those who have never been away.

    (xi)             It will, therefore, only be  those  with  no  clan  or
    family support who will not be in receipt of  remittances  from  abroad
    and who have no real prospect of securing access  to  a  livelihood  on
    return who will face the prospect of living  in  circumstances  falling
    below that which is acceptable in humanitarian protection terms.

    (xii)            The evidence indicates clearly that it is  not  simply
    those who originate from Mogadishu that may  now  generally  return  to
    live in the city without being subjected to an Article  15(c)  risk  or
    facing a real risk of destitution. On the  other  hand,  relocation  in
    Mogadishu for a person of a minority clan  with no former links to  the
    city, no access to funds and no other form of clan,  family  or  social
    support is unlikely to be realistic as, in  the  absence  of  means  to
    establish a home and some form of ongoing financial support there  will
    be a real risk of having  no  alternative  but  to  live  in  makeshift
    accommodation within an IDP camp where there is a real  possibility  of
    having  to  live  in  conditions   that  will  fall  below   acceptable
    humanitarian standards."

MOJ remains the  relevant  and  authoritative  country  guidance.  The  Home
Office Country Information and Guidance  of  July  2016  considered  various
human rights reports, referring at section 8.3 to  returns  of  diaspora  to
Somalia, and concluded at section 2.3.21 that the  situation  had  continued
to improve since 2014 and that there  was  no  reason  to  depart  from  the
existing country guidance. Whilst the Human Rights  Watch  report  dated  12
January 2017 refers to various security concerns, the  report  is,  for  the
most part, not particularly focussed on  Mogadishu,  and  overall  does  not
provide any justification for departing from  the  much  more  detailed  and
focussed guidance in MOJ. As for Dr Hoehne's report, it is relevant to  note
that the Tribunal in MOJ had some difficulties with his evidence as  to  the
security situation in  Mogadishu,  for  example  at  [129]  and  [130],  and
preferred the evidence of other experts in that respect. Accordingly I  have
considered the risk on return to the appellant in line with the  assessments
made in MOJ.

It is the appellant's case  that,  as  a  person  who  has  never  lived  in
Mogadishu, he falls within (xi) and (xii) as being a person with no clan  or
family support, with no remittances from abroad  and  no  real  prospect  of
securing access to a livelihood, such that he would be forced to live in  an
IDP camp in breach of Article 3. The decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
accepting such a conclusion has  been  set  aside  as  lacking  in  adequate
reasoning,  particularly  in  the  light  of  adverse  credibility  concerns
expressed by the judge arising from inconsistencies identified in  parts  of
the evidence.

As (x) makes clear, the burden of proof lies upon the  appellant  show  that
he would not be able to  access  economic  opportunities,  or  indeed  other
means of support, in Mogadishu. In my view he has failed to  do  that  given
the unreliable nature of the evidence he has provided.  Like  Judge  Khan  I
did not find the appellant to be  an  impressive  witness.  Aside  from  the
inconsistent evidence he provided before Judge Khan, as referred to at  [26]
of the judge's decision, there were further inconsistencies in his  evidence
before me, leading me to conclude that he has sought to adapt  his  evidence
to fit within (xi) and (xii) of MOJ.


Whilst the evidence previously  adduced  was  that  the  appellant  received
financial assistance, albeit limited, from  his  father  (according  to  his
father in his statement at [21], �30 a week, but otherwise according to  the
appellant �20 a week), his evidence before me, which I do  not  accept,  was
that his father  did  not  give  him  any  pocket  money  or  any  financial
assistance at all and that he  shared  his  clothes  with  his  father,  and
therefore that he would not receive any financial assistance  in  Mogadishu.
He stated that his father could not even assist him  in  having  his  mobile
telephone repaired, yet he was clearly able to obtain and fund  a  telephone
in the first place. I consider it to  be  the  case  that  his  father  does
provide him with some financial assistance in  the  UK,  although  I  accept
that that may be limited to �20 or �30 a week, and I note the evidence  that
his father managed to pay for his journey to  the  UK  when  he  first  came
here. In his expert country report, Dr Hoehne made it clear at [47]  of  the
report that there would be no  problem  with  remittances  being  sent  from
abroad and I find that the appellant would, therefore, be  able  to  receive
some limited support from his father, particularly initially whilst  getting
himself settled.

It is the appellant's claim that he  was  not  aware  of  any  relatives  in
Canada and this was only brought to his attention when referred  to  at  the
appeal hearing. I do not accept that that is the case. As I have  said,  the
appellant is not a reliable witness and it  seems  to  me  that  this  is  a
further example of him seeking to adapt his circumstances  to  fit  in  with
the country guidance. I am not prepared to accept that there  are  no  other
relatives, either within or outside Somalia, who are able  to  provide  some
limited support, at least initially until he is settled and has  found  some
employment.


As for the matter I specifically pointed out in my error of law decision  at
[15] there is a significant inconsistency in the evidence about the  age  at
which the appellant left Somalia. His claim, before the First-tier  Tribunal
and in his statement before me, to have lived in Somalia  for  only  one  to
two years and to have departed for Kenya in 1995, at the age of five  years,
whilst  consistent  with  his  father's  evidence  before   the   First-tier
Tribunal, is completely at odds with the evidence given  by  his  father  in
his own appeal on 11 December 2003. His father's evidence,  as  recorded  at
[12] of the decision of Adjudicator Lloyd, was that his  two  children  (the
appellant and his brother) were living in Somalia  at  that  time  with  his
aunt, after they had all left Jomvu refugee camp when  it  closed  in  1998,
following the death  of  the  appellant's  mother  in  1996,  and  his  (the
appellant's father's) subsequent departure from Somalia in 2003.  Indeed  it
was on the basis of that evidence that the  respondent  considered,  in  the
decision of 27 July 2016, that the appellant had spent his  formative  years
in Somalia.


In response to the observations I made in my  error  of  law  decision,  the
appellant's father, in his statement, claimed that he had left the  camp  in
1995 with his sons and said that he did  not  know  why  the  judge  in  his
appeal had considered that he had left in 1998.  However  there  can  be  no
doubt, from the various references throughout the decision,  at  [9],  [12],
[16] and [17], that his evidence before the judge in his appeal was that  he
had left in 1998. The appellant's father did not appear before me to  submit
to further questioning and clarification. It was said that  he  had  had  to
take his daughter to a hospital appointment, but no  reason  was  given  why
her mother could not have taken her so  that  he  was  able  to  attend  the
hearing. The appellant's father's evidence at his  own  appeal  hearing  was
accepted as credible and it was on that basis that he  was  granted  refugee
status. There is no reason, therefore,  why  that  evidence  should  now  be
disregarded in place of the  current  claim,  particularly  when  there  are
other concerns about the reliability of  the  evidence  in  the  appellant's
appeal. Indeed the evidence given by  the  appellant's  father  at  his  own
appeal hearing is consistent with the account given by the appellant to  his
probation officer and recorded in the OASys report of 30  January  2017,  at
B17 and B19 of the appeal bundle before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  that  he
was  born  and  raised  in  Somalia  by  different  uncles,  aunts  and  his
grandmother. I note  that  that  account  has  since  been  supplemented  by
further evidence recorded in the more recent OASys report of 16 August  2017
at B41 of the updated appeal bundle, with reference to him moving  to  Kenya
and Tanzania with his grandmother and brother and living  in  Tanzania  with
his grandmother and brother, but that  in  turn  is  inconsistent  with  his
account at [4] of his statement of 24 January 2017 and the account given  to
the psychologist Lisa Davies in her report of 2 February 2017  at  paragraph
3.2.1, which refers to him having left his aunt/ grandmother in Kenya.


In my view the appellant has sought to diminish  his  links  to  Somalia  in
order to enhance his claim and, contrary to the  account  given  before  the
Tribunal, he spent the majority of his youth and formative years in  Somalia
prior to coming to the UK at the age of 16 years, spending  only  a  limited
period time in Kenya and Tanzania prior to arriving  in  the  UK.  That,  of
course, is a significant factor in assessing his ability to  integrate  into
life in Mogadishu and to access support and it is relevant to note that  the
expert opinion of Dr Hoehne was based upon an acceptance  of  the  appellant
having only lived in Somalia as a child up to the age  of  five  years  (see
[41]). Plainly he would be more familiar with the country  than  he  claims,
albeit that he originated from a different region and  had  not,  or  so  he
claims, previously lived in Mogadishu.


With regard to problems the appellant may encounter as a result of  being  a
member of a minority clan, it is the case that that is a relevant factor  to
take into account. However, MOJ at [337] to [343] makes it clear  that  that
is not in itself a risk factor, although it would nevertheless  be  relevant
in assessing support, as made  clear  at  [343].  There  is  no  indication,
however, that an absence of support as a member of  a  minority  clan  would
prevent access to employment or other opportunities.  Indeed,  the  Tribunal
found  at  [342],  with  regard  to  clan  support,  that  "this  source  of
assistance must not be overstated". It is relevant  to  note  in  any  event
that the Bajuni do have a presence in  Mogadishu,  as  referred  to  by  the
respondent at [26] of the refusal decision and not disputed by  the  country
expert Dr Hoehne, albeit,  as  he  observed  at  [37],  not  commanding  any
authority there. Nevertheless it is clear that the appellant  would  not  be
isolated on the basis of his minority clan membership but would be  able  to
find some form of support from within his clan.


Turning to the question of access to employment, I  see  no  reason  not  to
rely on the findings made in MOJ. Paragraphs [344] to [352] of  MOJ  provide
details of the opportunities available to  returnees  as  a  result  of  the
economic  boom,  referring  to  opportunities  in  unskilled  work  such  as
building labour, and emphasising at [351] the advantages for returnees  from
the West in seeking employment. There is nothing in  the  evidence  provided
in MOJ in these paragraphs or the  preceding  paragraphs  dealing  with  the
significance of clan membership to support the  appellant's  claim  that  he
would have difficulty finding employment. On the contrary  the  evidence  is
that he has attended college in the UK and has  undertaken  various  courses
both within and  outside  prison,  including  a  car  mechanics  course  and
English language courses, all of which would clearly  provide  him  with  an
advantage in seeking  employment,  whether  or  not  he  has  had  practical
experience of car mechanics. The appellant relies on the  expert  report  of
Dr Hoehne in asserting that the job opportunities described in  MOJ  do  not
in fact exist and I note Dr Hoehne's assessment at  [43]  to  [47]  in  that
regard, criticising the findings in  MOJ  as  out  of  touch  with  reality.
However it is relevant to note that Dr Hoehne's  view  in  this  regard  was
rejected by the Tribunal in MOJ and I refer in particular to [347]  -  [349]
and [352].


Accordingly, it seems to me that the appellant  has  failed  to  demonstrate
that he would not be able to establish himself in  Mogadishu  and  secure  a
livelihood for himself, with  some  initial  assistance  from  relatives  to
accommodate and  maintain  himself  until  in  receipt  of  an  income.  The
evidence does not suggest that the appellant, as a young healthy  male  with
an ability to speak fluently in English  and  with  various  qualifications,
would find himself in an IDP camp  and  there  is  therefore  no  basis  for
concluding that his deportation would breach Article 3 of  the  ECHR.  There
is no need, therefore, to consider the implications of Said.


As for Article 8, I refer to the findings of Judge Khan at  [48]  and  [49],
noting that he allowed the appeal under Article 8 only as a  result  of  his
positive findings on Article 3.  There  is  no  significant  change  in  the
appellant's circumstances to justify a departure from the findings  made  at
[48] and [49]. For the reasons given above in relation to Article 3  I  find
no 'very significant obstacles to integration' in Somalia, but in any  event
the appellant would need to demonstrate very compelling  circumstances  over
and above those in paragraph 399A and section  117C(4),  as  required  under
section 117C(6), which I find he is unable to do.


The appellant has no dependants and is a single  male.  He  lives  with  his
step-mother and father and half-siblings and, whilst he claims to  be  close
to them, has spent a lengthy period apart  from  them  when  in  prison.  He
committed a very serious offence for which he received  a  lengthy  term  of
imprisonment of 66 months. That was in addition to a previous conviction  in
September 2011 for possession of a weapon for which he received a six  month
prison sentence. Although Lisa Davies, in her more recent  report,  assessed
his risk of  re-offending  as  being  low  and  a  return  to  his  previous
lifestyle as being of low likelihood, she  opined  at  [1.8]  and  [6.1]  to
[6.3] of her recent report that he presented  a  moderate  risk  of  serious
harm to the public. In the more recent OASys report of 16  August  2017  the
appellant was assessed at page B65 as being a medium risk to the public  and
I attach weight to that report, written as it was by the probation  services
who had observed him over a significant period  of  time.  Whilst  there  is
evidence of the appellant having engaged in some  rehabilitative  work  such
as that referred to in the letter dated 9 May 2017  from  Coventry  Recovery
Community (page C1) and the letter of 16  August  2017  from  his  probation
officer (page B26 and B27), the evidence in that regard is  limited.  It  is
also relevant to note that  the  appellant  remains  on  licence  and  under
threat of deportation and thus  has  every  incentive  to  comply  with  the
rehabilitative process and the conditions of his licence at this stage.

 In addition to these considerations, my findings  are  that  the  appellant
spent his formative years in Somalia and, whilst returning after  a  lengthy
absence would no doubt present its difficulties, he would be at no  risk  on
return to that country and would be  able  to  re-establish  himself  there.
Accordingly I do  not  accept  that  he  has  demonstrated  very  compelling
circumstances outweighing the public interest in his deportation  and  I  do
not find that he is  able  to  meet  any  of  the  exceptions  to  automatic
deportation.

DECISION

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved an  error  on
a point of law in relation to its findings on Article 3,  and  the  decision
has accordingly been set aside in that respect. I re-make  the  decision  by
dismissing the appellant's appeal on  Article  3  grounds,  as  well  as  on
Article 8 grounds and on all other grounds.
