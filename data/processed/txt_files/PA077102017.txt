                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge O'Hagan, promulgated on 22 February 2018, following a hearing  at
    Birmingham on 23rd January  2018.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the   Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Ethiopia, and was  born  on  13th
    May 1987.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The essence of the Appellant's claim is that in April  2015  he  joined
    Patriotic Ginbot 7 ("PG7").  He joined the group with six members.   He
    contributed money.   He  attended  meetings.   Every  three  months  he
    distributed leaflets in Bahir Dar, where he lived with  his  wife.   On
    7th August 2016 he attended a demonstration by  about  ï¿½50,000  people.
    They were protesting in support  of  various  political  causes.   This
    included the release of  political  prisoners.   The  authorities  used
    violence.  They were shooting on  the  crowd.   The  demonstration  was
    dispersed.  The Appellant was arrested.  He was  taken  to  a  military
    camp where he stayed for a day, being transferred to a detention centre
    where he was held for thirty days.  He was regularly  beaten.   He  was
    released on 7th September 2016.  This was after his  uncle  bribed  the
    authorities.  He left Ethiopia clandestinely on 8th September 2016, and
    travelled through various countries before arriving in the UK to  claim
    asylum.

The Judge's Findings

 4. In an  extended  section,  the  judge,  under  the  heading  "analysis,
    findings  and  conclusions",  gave   reasons   for   disbelieving   the
    Appellant's account.   The  judge  concluded  that  the  Appellant  had
    fabricated  his  account  (paragraph  38).   The  claims  made  by  the
    Appellants were "not" inherently  implausible,  but  are  things  "that
    could possibly happen in Ethiopia" but that was not to  say  that  they
    actually happened  (paragraph  39).  The  judge  looked  at  supporting
    evidence and the evidence of supporting witnesses (paragraph 42).   The
    judge observed that the Appellant's  claim  was  that  the  authorities
    warned him off in 2009.  Having imprisoned him the authorities may well
    have taken the view that a warning would  be  sufficient  to  make  him
    desist in the future.

 5. On the Appellant's account,

         "Nothing happened  for  another  five  years,  despite  his  having
         ignored the warning, and being very active in  his  anti-government
         work".  This was, on his account, a man who had twice come  to  the
         adverse attention of the authorities.  He was someone  who  was  on
         their radar.  I find it lacking in credibility that,  having  given
         him a warning which he  ignored,  the  authorities  would  then  be
         content to do nothing over such a lengthy period.  I find even more
         lacking in credibility  the  account  that,  when  the  authorities
         finally took action in 2014, it was  simply  to  give  him  another
         warning.  On his account, he again  ignored  this,  and  again  the
         authorities did nothing" (paragraph 48).

 6. For the purposes of this appeal, the judge's findings in terms  of  the
    Appellant's sur place activity in the United Kingdom  was  particularly
    significant.  The judge observed that:

         "The evidence was lacking  of  anything  more  than  attendance  at
         meetings with PG7 supporters.  On the evidence before  me,  at  the
         most, he was engaged in low-level activity.  The issue, then, comes
         down to this: whilst the Appellant was  not  a  figure  of  adverse
         interest to the Ethiopia authorities prior to his  arrival  in  the
         United Kingdom, would he now be so as a result of his actions since
         coming to this country?" (paragraph 52).

    The judge was not of the view that the  Appellant  would  come  to  the
    adverse interest of the authorities if he were to  be  returned.   (See
    paragraphs 53 to 55).

 7. In his conclusions, the judge stated  that  it  was  not  realistic  to
    suppose  that  the  Appellant's  activities  would  be  known  to   the
    authorities upon  return  to  Ethiopia.   As  to  the  Appellant  being
    required to express a viewpoint for an arrival in Ethiopia,  the  judge
    was of the view that,

         "Given his past behaviour, it seems to me sensible  to  suppose  he
         would lie and dissemble freely with the authorities in Ethiopia  as
         he has with the authorities in this country.  In terms  of  whether
         it would be reasonable to expect him to do so to avoid persecution,
         it seems to me difficult to say that it would not, given  that,  on
         the evidence before me, the  Appellant  has  no  genuine  political
         interest, but has merely feigned interest to build an asylum claim"
         (see paragraph 56(iii)).

 8. The appeal was dismissed.

The Grounds of Application

 9. The grounds of application state that the judge erred in law given what
    had been decided in HJ (Iran) and given what was said in RT (Zimbabwe).
     The judge could not assume that if the Appellant were asked about  his
    political ideas and opinion that the Appellant would be expected to lie
    and would indeed do so.  The fact was that it  was  accepted  that  the
    Appellant had engaged in PG7 activities in the UK (see paragraph 41  of
    the determination).  The judge did find it realistic  to  suppose  that
    the Appellant's activities would be known to the  Ethiopia  authorities
    (see paragraph 56(i)).   The  judge  did  state  that  someone  in  the
    Appellant's position might have acted as  he  described  (at  paragraph
    47).

10. On 29th May 2018, permission to appeal was granted by the  Tribunal  on
    the basis that the judge may well have  erred  in  stating  that,  with
    respect to the Appellant's sur place political activities  in  the  UK,
    upon which he could be questioned in Ethiopia (see paragraph  56(iii)),
    that he would be expected to lie.

Submissions

11. At the hearing before me on 2nd October 2018, Mr Howard,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Appellant, relied upon the grounds  of  application.   He
    submitted that given what had  been  accepted  at  paragraph  56(i)  to
    56(iii) it was presumptuous to  assume  that  the  Appellant  would  be
    expected to lie about his political activities in the  UK.   He  relied
    upon HJ (Iran) and RT (Zimbabwe).  This was a case where the judge  had
    accepted that the Appellant had been engaged in political activities in
    the UK.  It was a case where the judge had accepted that the Appellant,
    on  return  to  Ethiopia,  would  be  apprehended   at   the   airport.
    Accordingly, it was simply incongruous to then go on  to  say  that  it
    cannot be said that he would be expected to not lie.

12. For his part, Mr Mills submitted that all too often,  litigants  forget
    what HJ (Iran) was all  about.   What  it  was  about  was  a  person's
    "fundamental characteristics" being denied to that person, in terms  of
    their true identity, and it was unlawful on that basis,  to  supress  a
    "fundamental characteristic" of  a  person,  whether  that  be  one  of
    sexuality or of religion, or of political opinion.  In RT (Zimbabwe) it
    was the political opinion  that  was  deemed  to  be  the  "fundamental
    characteristic".  Where, however, a person had no political opinion  as
    a fundamental characteristic, as the judge  found  in  this  case,  the
    principles in HJ (Iran) was  simply  not  applicable.   The  judge  had
    expressly found the Appellant to have put  forward  a  claim  that  was
    based upon lies.  Even in Danian [1990] INLR  533,  it  was  recognised
    that "opportunistic post-flight activities will not necessarily  create
    a real risk of persecution in the claimant's home country".   This  was
    indeed the position here.

13. In YB (Eritrea) [2008] EWCA Civ 360, practical guidance  was  given  by
    the Court of Appeal, where it was said, that:

         "The real question in most cases would  be  what  follows  for  the
         individual Claimant.  If, for example, any information reaching the
         embassy would be that the Claimant identified in the photograph  is
         a hanger on with no real commitment to the opportunist cause,  that
         would go directly to the issue flagged" (see paragraph 18).

    Mr Mills submitted that the Appellant in this case indeed a "hanger  on
    with no real commitment to the opportunistic cause" and he could not be
    a person would not lie in order to avoid  persecution  in  Ethiopia  on
    arrival.

14. In reply, Mr Howells submitted that even if the Appellant was simply  a
    potential sympathiser, that would be enough.  Yet, in this case he  was
    involved with lower level activities.  He was attending meetings.  This
    very  fact  would  be  one  which  would  attract  attention  from  the
    authorities and he would be at  risk  of  ill-treatment  on  the  lower
    standard.  I should allow the appeal.

No Error of Law

15. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.  My  reasons  are
    as follows.  First, this is a case where the judge was clear  in  terms
    of the Appellant's sur place activities in the UK.  He expressly stated
    that "the evidence  was  lack  of  anything  more  than  attendance  at
    meetings with PG7 supporters.  On the evidence before me, at  most,  he
    was engaged in low-level activity" (paragraph 52).

16. Second, the judge then immediately went  on  to  consider  the  leading
    authorities in this regard, referring to TM (Zimbabwe) [2010] EWCA  Civ
    916, and to YB (Eritrea) [2002] EWCA Civ 360,  before  concluding  that
    the crucial question would be whether the Appellant was  "a  hanger  on
    with no real commitment to  the  opportunistic  cause,",  because  that
    would go against him.  The judge then specifically  considered  the  HJ
    principle that arises from HJ (Iran) [2010] UKSC 31  and  pointed  out,
    that, "given his past behaviour, it seems to  me  sensible  to  suppose
    that he would lie and dissemble  as  freely  with  the  authorities  in
    Ethiopia as he has with the authorities in this country", but the judge
    came to that conclusion specifically on the basis that  "the  Appellant
    has no genuine political interest, but has merely feigned  interest  to
    build an asylum claim" (paragraph 56(iii)).

17. It is difficult to see why, against this explicit and clear  reasoning,
    the  decision  of  the  judge  fell  into  error.   The  Appellant  had
    fabricated his claim.  He had done so in relation to the account before
    he came to the UK.  He was found to have been of no adverse interest to
    the authorities in Ethiopia to begin with.  He had  no  sincerely  held
    political views.  He had attended demonstrations in the UK, but only to
    bolster his claim.  He had no genuine political conviction.  The  judge
    had found, as a question of fact, that the instinct of the Appellant in
    the immediate first instance, was to generally lie, but that even if he
    were to tell the truth upon arrival in Ethiopia, this would not lead to
    any adverse interest in him, because the truth of the matter  was  that
    he had no genuine interest in politics.  He had  manufactured  a  false
    claim and the judge had found that he was not at risk.

Notice of Decision

18. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

19. No anonymity direction is made.

20. This appeal is dismissed.
