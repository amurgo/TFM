For the Appellant:     Ms Emma King, instructed by Rahman & Co.
For the Respondent:    Mr Chris Avery of the Specialist Appeals Team


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by Mrs Sunda Dadi Samba who was born on  2  May  1981
    in what was then Zaire and is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
     Her application for asylum in this country was refused on 1 March 2012
    and she appealed against the consequential decision to remove her  from
    the United Kingdom as an illegal entrant.

2.   Her appeal to the First-tier Tribunal came before Judge  Talbot  on  13
    April 2012 and was dismissed.  Subsequently, an  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal came before Judge Allen, who upheld the First-tier decision on
    the asylum claim but found that there had  been  an  error  of  law  in
    determining the Article 8 claim.  The appeal therefore was  listed  for
    rehearing before the Upper Tribunal on the Article 8 issue only.

3.   On 12 March 2013, the Article  8  appeal  was  heard  by  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Davy.  He dismissed the  appeal,  but  subsequently  his
    determination was set aside by Upper Tribunal Judge Jordan, and  so  it
    falls to me to remake the decision on the Article 8 appeal.

4.    That  appeal  proceeded  today  by  way  of  submissions  only.    The
    appellant's husband came to Field House but had  to  stay  outside  the
    hearing room to look after the children, and I am grateful to our court
    interpreter for giving Mrs  Samba,  the  appellant,  the  gist  of  the
    representatives' submissions.

5.   Ms King's submissions on behalf of the appellant were  based  upon  her
    skeleton argument in which she relies in particular upon  the  judgment
    of Mr Justice Blake in MM, upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in ZH
    (Tanzania) and upon the decision of a Presidential panel of  the  Upper
    Tribunal in the case of Sanade.

6.   The circumstances of the appellant  are  not  in  dispute  between  the
    parties.  As Mr Avery pointed out in his submissions, the appellant  is
    an illegal entrant and her family life with her  husband  commenced  in
    2008 when she was outside the United Kingdom and, as Mr Avery stresses,
    family life between the appellant and her husband  continued  for  some
    considerable time apart.  He was in this country, she was in the Congo.
     Two children were born to the appellant after her marriage,  but  they
    were born in the Congo, not in the UK.  Her youngest child was born  in
    the United Kingdom after she arrived here.  All three are  now  British
    citizens and Mr  Masamba,  the  appellant's  husband,  is  himself  now
    British.  So we have the situation where if the three children  are  to
    remain in this country and be brought up here, they would  be  deprived
    of the company of their mother for a very long time if she  had  to  go
    back to the Congo and they stayed in this country.

7.   It is not in dispute between the  parties  that  the  appellant  cannot
    meet the normal requirements of Appendix FM to the  Immigration  Rules.
    Her husband, although he has had work in the past and has just signed a
    contract for zero-hours work with a different  company,  has  not  been
    earning enough and, in all likelihood, will not be  earning  enough  in
    future to reach the threshold of ï¿½18,600 in Appendix FM.  The only  way
    in which the appellant could succeed under Appendix FM would  be  under
    EX.1(a).  She would not only have to  have  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with her children, which is not in  dispute,  but
    it would also have to be shown that  it  would  not  be  reasonable  to
    expect the children to leave the United Kingdom.

8.   Would it be reasonable to expect them to do so.?  It seems to  me  that
    there is a tension between the requirements of EX.1(a) and the European
    Economic Area Regulations which do,  at  Regulation  15A(4A),  envisage
    third-country nationals being able to stay in  this  country  in  order
    that British children would not have to  leave  the  territory  of  the
    European Union.  As Mr Avery points out, this can be considered part of
    a much wider distinction between the rights of European Union  citizens
    and their family members, as compared to the rights of British citizens
    and their family members.  But it  does  seem  to  me  that  the  whole
    tendency of our case law, particularly since the landmark  judgment  in
    ZH (Tanzania), is such that British children should not be compelled to
    leave the United Kingdom if it  would  be  in  their  interests  to  be
    brought up in the United Kingdom.  In ZH itself, the British father  of
    the children was unable to look after them, therefore they  had  to  be
    looked after by their mother, and she would have to depart to  Tanzania
    with them if she was not allowed to stay in the  United  Kingdom.   The
    Supreme Court ruled that it would be contrary to Article 8 if  she  and
    the children had to leave.

9.   In the present case, the appellant's husband is able to look after  the
    children, so it is not  on  all  fours  with  ZH  (Tanzania),  but  the
    children are very young, they are currently aged 2, 3 and 6, and it  is
    universally acknowledged that at that tender age children ought  to  be
    looked after by their mother, if at all possible.

10.  Ms King has also drawn my attention to a passage  in  Sanade  paragraph
    95, where the Upper Tribunal says that:

         "Where the child or  indeed  the  remaining  spouse  is  a  British
         citizen, and therefore a citizen of the European Union, it  is  not
         possible to require them to relocate outside of the European  Union
         or to submit that it would be reasonable for them to do  so.   This
         serves  to  emphasise  the  importance   of   nationality   already
         identified in the decision of the Supreme Court in  ZH  (Tanzania).
         If interference with the family life is to  be  justified,  it  can
         only be on the basis that the conduct of the person to  be  removed
         gives  rise  to  considerations  of  such  weight  as  to   justify
         separation."

11.  In the instant case,  the  appellant  is  not  facing  deportation  for
    criminal behaviour.  She has breached our immigration laws by  entering
    the country illegally, but it does seem to me, despite the best efforts
    of Mr Avery, that in the circumstances of the  present  case,  although
    when they were younger two of them were in the Congo, it would  not  be
    reasonable to expect the children to be  brought  up  in  that  country
    when, as British citizens, they have a right  to  live  in  the  United
    Kingdom and, as the Supreme Court emphasised in  ZH  (Tanzania),  enjoy
    all  the  benefits  of  being  brought  up  in  the  country  of  their
    nationality, which undoubtedly would  be  superior  to  what  would  be
    available to them in the Congo.

12.  Although the  argument  today  really  centred  on  whether  Article  8
    outside the Immigration Rules would avail the appellant, it  does  seem
    to me that in terms of EX.1(a) of Appendix FM also,  it  would  not  be
    reasonable to expect the British children to leave the United  Kingdom.
    It is one thing for British parents to emigrate to, say, Australia  for
    a better life, taking the children with  them.   It  is  quite  another
    thing to say that it would be reasonable for the children to  be  taken
    overseas, when neither parent wants to go and the  children  would  not
    have a better life  abroad.   In  those  circumstances,  the  appellant
    succeeds under Article 8 both within the Immigration Rules and  outside
    them.

13.  The appeal is allowed under EX.1(a) of Appendix FM to  the  Immigration
    Rules and, though this is really superfluous, under Article 8 per se.



DECISION

The appeal is allowed.
