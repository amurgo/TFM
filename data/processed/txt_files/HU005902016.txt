                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Lloyd,  promulgated  on  3rd  January  2017,  following  a  hearing  at
    Birmingham Sheldon Court on 9th December 2016.  In  the  determination,
    the  judge  dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  therefore  the
    Appellant subsequently applied for,  and  was  granted,  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a national of India, a female, and  was  born  on  1st
    April 1985.  She appealed against the decision of the Respondent  dated
    24th October 2015, refusing her entry clearance to join her fianc�,  Mr
    Sukhdev Singh, in the UK, the latter having indefinite leave to  remain
    in this country.  The decision of the ECO was upheld by the ECM on 14th
    April 2016.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that she was due to marry the Sponsor  by  way
    of an arranged marriage, and an  engagement  had  taken  place  on  9th
    September 2015 during the Sponsor's visit to India,  and  the  marriage
    was now to take place on 11th February 2016 at  a  Registry  Office  in
    Derby, followed by a reception in Wolverhampton on the same day.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge acknowledged that the parties  had  met,  that  the  proposed
    arranged married was in place, that cultural norms had to be taken into
    account in cases involving an arranged marriage, and that,  although  a
    lot of the communication evidence between the parties was postdecision,
    raising the possibility that  this  might  have  been  manufactured  to
    bolster  the  appeal,  "there  is  no   positive   evidence   of   such
    manufacturing and I am prepared  to  accept  these  documents  on  face
    value" (paragraph 21).

 5. On this basis, the judge was clear that, "I accept that  the  Appellant
    and Sponsor are in a genuine and subsisting relationship and that  they
    intend to marry.  I therefore  also  accept  that  they  have  met  the
    Respondent's Grounds of Refusal" (paragraph 22).

 6. Nevertheless, the judge then curiously, purported to refuse the  appeal
    on the basis of human rights law, taking the decision that the  Sponsor
    could relocate to India where the Appellant and the Sponsor  could  get
    married and  enjoy  family  life  together  and  that  this  would  not
    interfere with their Article 8 rights (paragraph 26), and nor  was  the
    decision disproportionate in this respect (paragraph 28).

 7. On 7th July 2017, permission to appeal was granted on  the  basis  that
    the judge had already at paragraph 22 come to the firm  view  that  the
    Respondent's Grounds of Refusal had been met, and yet  the  judge  then
    proceeded to dismiss the appeal under Article 8.  The  judge  had  also
    overlooked the fact that in Izuazu [2013] UKUT 45, the approach to such
    cases was stipulated,  such  that  a  judge  first  had  to  apply  the
    Immigration Rules, and  only  where  the  Claimant  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules, would it then be necessary to  undertake  an
    assessment of the situation under Article 8.

 8. The Rule 24 response states that, "the judge did find the Appellant met
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules".

The Hearing

 9. At the hearing before me, Mr Cisnekos  submitted  that  the  judge  had
    specifically  made  the  following  four  findings  in  favour  of  the
    Appellant.  First, that the Appellant's fianc�, Mr Sukhdev  Singh,  had
    indefinite leave to remain in the UK (paragraph 2).  Second,  that  the
    Appellant and the Sponsor had met  (paragraph  21).   Third,  that  the
    proposed marriage arrangements were in place in the UK (paragraph  21).
    Fourth, that the Appellant and  the  Sponsor  were  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship and that they did intend  to  marry  (paragraph
    22).  Mr Cisnekos submitted that the judge had erred in law  by  making
    an assessment of Article 8, having already found that the Appellant met
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

10. In reply, Mr McVeety submitted that he would have to concede  that  the
    judge had fallen into error because the Appellant had already satisfied
    the Immigration Rules, and her appeal ought to have been allowed.

Error of Law

11. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that  I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

12. First, it is plain that the  judge  (at  paragraph  22  had  found  the
    Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  to  be  in  a  genuine   and   subsisting
    relationship, such that the concerns of the refusal letter had been met
    head on, and as such the appeal ought to have been allowed.

13.  Second,  the  recourse  in  these  circumstances  to  Article  8   was
    misconceived,  if  regard  is  had  to  Izuazu  [2013]  UKUT  45.   The
    suggestion (paragraph 26) that, "taking all of this into account, I  do
    not accept that, if they chose to do so, the Sponsor could not relocate
    to India where the Appellant and Sponsor could get  married  and  enjoy
    family life together"  is  unwarranted.   On  this  basis,  no  foreign
    marriage, that complied with the Immigration Rules could ever  succeed.
    Human rights are a backup where a Claimant is unable to  first  satisfy
    the domestic provisions in the Immigration Rules, allowing him  or  her
    thereafter to fall back on general human rights provisions, as set down
    by the Strasbourg Human Rights Court and  the  European  Convention  on
    Human Rights.  They are not to be used to frustrate a claim,  that  can
    properly be made out under domestic law and  validly  upheld,  as  that
    would be perverse.

14. I remake the decision on the basis of  the  findings  of  the  original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  For the reasons that I have given above, I allow this appeal.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside  the  decision  of  the
Regional Judge.  I remake the decision as follows.

This appeal is allowed.

No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have made a fee award of any fee which has been paid or may be payable.
