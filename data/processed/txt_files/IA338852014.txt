For the Appellant:     Ms Isherwood;  Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer.
For the Respondent:    Ms. Nasim; Counsel

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal against a  determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge B A Morris promulgated  on  13th  March  2015,  in  which  she
       allowed an appeal against a decision made by the Secretary of  State
       to refuse an application for leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom
       as a partner, under appendix FM of the immigration rules.


    2. The appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home Department  and
       the respondent to this appeal, is Mr. Aftab Ahmed.  However for ease
       of reference, in the course of this determination we shall adopt the
       parties' status as it was before the First-tier Tribunal.  We  shall
       in this determination, refer to Mr. Ahmed as the appellant  and  the
       Secretary of State as the respondent.


    3. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Kelly
       on 6th May 2015.  The matter comes before us to consider whether  or
       not the determination by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Morris  involved
       the making of a material error of law, and  if  so,  to  remake  the
       decision.


    Background


    4. The appellant originally entered the United Kingdom on  5th  October
       2010 as a Tier 4 (General) student  migrant,  with  entry  clearance
       valid until 4th February 2012.  A subsequent application for further
       leave to remain in the UK was  initially refused, but later  granted
       following a successful appeal, extending the  appellant's  leave  to
       remain in the UK, until 30 June 2014.   On  16th  January  2014  the
       appellant made an application for leave to remain in the UK  on  the
       basis of his relationship with Sakhina  Begum,  a  British  Citizen.
       The application was refused for the reasons set out in a reasons for
       refusal letter dated 13th August 2014.  Importantly, the application
       was refused upon the basis that  the  Secretary  of  State  was  not
       satisfied that paragraph EX.1(b) of the Immigration Rules were  met.
       That  is,  the  appellant  had  not  established  that   there   are
       insurmountable obstacles to family life with his partner  continuing
       outside the UK.


    5. In her decision of 13th August 2014, the  respondent  did  not  even
       remotely suggest that the appellant had failed to satisfy any of the
       other requirements set out in Appendix FM of the immigration  rules,
       and there was certainly no suggestion that the appellant had  failed
       to provide the specified evidence required under Appendix FM-SE.


    6.  At  the  hearing  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Morris,  the
       presenting officer adopted the refusal letter and accepted  that  if
       the appellant  meets  any  other  part  of  the  immigration  rules,
       paragraph EX does not fall to be considered.


    7. Having heard all of the evidence,  and  that  evidence  having  been
       tested  in  cross-examination,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge   Morris
       concluded that the appellant had met  the  suitability  requirements
       set out in section S-LTR, and the eligibility requirements  set  out
       in section E-LTRP.  As to the financial requirements, the First-tier
       Tribunal Judge concluded;


           "the financial requirements in  this  case  is  a  gross  annual
           income of at least �18,600.   The information  before  me  shows
           that by a combination of her employment at the 99p store and her
           self-employment in the cosmetic and  clothing  design  business,
           the sponsor is in receipt of a gross annual income in excess  of
           �18,600" [19]


    8. First-tier Tribunal Judge Morris concluded;


           "By reason of all the matters set  out  above,  and  taking  the
           evidence as a whole, as I do, I  find  that  the  appellant  has
           shown on the balance  probabilities  that  the  requirements  of
           Section R-LTRP.1.1.(c) are met and  the  appeal  is  accordingly
           allowed." [22]


The Ground of appeal


    9. The respondent advances one ground.  That  is,  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge Morris misdirected herself as to the law and  failed  to  make
       material findings.  Broadly stated, it is said that the  immigration
       rules required not only a certain level of maintenance, but that the
       maintenance requirement must be evidenced in a certain way, speaking
       to the finances of the sponsor during a specific period.


Discussion


   10. The  respondents'  decision  of  13th  August  2014  considered  the
       application made  by  the  appellant  under  the  partner  route  by
       reference to the requirements of Appendix FM,  R-LTRP  1.1(d)  only.
       Having concluded that relocating to Pakistan together, may  cause  a
       degree of hardship to the appellant and his partner, and that  there
       was no  evidence  to  suggest  that  there  are  any  insurmountable
       obstacles preventing the appellant and his partner  from  continuing
       their relationship in Pakistan, the respondent concluded;


           "in view of the above the Secretary of State  is  not  satisfied
           that EX.1 applies in your clients case and so he does  not  meet
           the requirements of R-LTRP.1.1(d).  your client  application  is
           refused under D-LTRP.1.3 and your client does  not  qualify  for
           leave under the ten-year route."


   11. It is unsurprising, given that  the  respondents  decision  of  13th
       August  2014,  did  not  take  issue  with  any  of  the  evidential
       requirements set out in Appendix FM-SE, that the evidence before the
       First-tier Tribunal in that respect was somewhat  limited.   However
       it is plain that there was before the First-tier Tribunal, a  letter
       from the sponsor's employer that has attached to it a  statement  of
       the terms and conditions of her employment, together with wage slips
       for the period between 8th November  2013  and  5th  December  2014.
       There was also  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  a  copy  of  the
       sponsors P60 for the year ending 5th  April 2014 and a  letter  from
       the sponsors Accountant confirming  that  that  the  sponsor  had  a
       combined income of �19,047  from her employment and self-employment.


   12. As  the  issue  as  to  whether  the  appellant  met  the  evidential
       requirements set out in Appendix  FM-SE  was  not  contested  by  the
       respondent either in the decision that gave rise to the appeal before
       the First-tier Tribunal, nor at the hearing of the appeal itself, the
       First-tier Tribunal Judge  was  entitled  to  deal  with  the  matter
       briefly. It was open to First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Morris  to  find,
       upon the evidence before her, that the  financial  requirements  were
       met by the appellants by reference to a combination of  the  sponsors
       of employment at  the  99p  Store  and  her  self-employment  in  the
       cosmetic and clothing design business.


   13. That being so, it was open to First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Morris  to
       find  that  the  appellant  had  established,   on   a   balance   of
       probabilities that the requirements of  Section  R-LTRP.1.1.(c)  were
       met and to allow the appeal accordingly.

          Decision:


   14. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve
       the making of an error on a point of law  capable  of  affecting  the
       outcome of the decision.
