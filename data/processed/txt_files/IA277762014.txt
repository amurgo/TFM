     Immigration Judge in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  renewed  by  the
     appellant by application  made  on  12  December  2014  which  remains
     undetermined.
  2. By letter faxed on 4 February  2015,  the  appellant's  representative

     appeal.
  3. Pursuant to Rule 17(2) of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)

     Upper Tribunal consents to the withdrawal, except in  relation  to  an
     application for permission to appeal.   My consent  is  not  therefore
     necessary.
