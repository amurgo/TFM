For the Appellant:     Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Mr A Caskie, Advocate, instructed by Chung & Rea,
Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The parties are as described above, but for continuity of reference the
    rest of this decision refers to them as they were in the FtT.

 2. The SSHD  appeals  against  a  decision  by  FtT  Judge  Heatherington,
    promulgated on 4 April 2017, allowing the appellant's appeal on  asylum
    and human rights grounds.

 3. The applications  by  the  SSHD,  the  grant  of  permission,  and  the
    appellant's rule 24  response  all  deal  with  issues  of  timeliness;
    however, Mr Caskie conceded that the application was timeous.

 4. The substantive grounds of appeal rely  upon  QH  (Christians  -  risk)
    China CG [2014] UKUT 86 (IAC). They maintain that  although  the  judge
    found the appellant to be at risk in his home area there was no finding
    that he was subject to an arrest warrant, on a black  list,  or  had  a
    pending sentence, and so that risk was limited, and internal relocation
    was available.

 5. Mr Matthews said that the SSHD's decision at �17-18 expressly  rejected
    the appellant's evidence that the  authorities  in  China  visited  his
    family home every year looking for  him,  and  that  the  FtT  made  no
    finding on the point.  In contrast, on a loan shark issue, the FtT  had
    explicitly  rejected  the  claim  because   internal   relocation   was
    available.  This was a lacuna which had to be remedied by setting aside
    and carrying out a further fact-finding exercise.

 6. I asked for the respondent's submission on how that exercise should  be
    conducted.  Mr Matthews said it might be by remitting the case  to  the
    FtT for further decision by Judge Heatherington or by another judge, or
    by further decision in  the  UT.   The  respondent  would  prefer  that
    exercise to be carried out by a judge other than  Judge  Heatherington,
    but did not submit that he had to be excluded.

 7. Mr Caskie relied upon the rule 24 response, as follows: the judge  made
    a  generally  favourable  credibility  finding;  that  encompassed  the
    evidence that he escaped while the arrest process was ongoing and  that
    the authorities continued to have an interest  in  him;  there  was  no
    requirement to give reasons on every single point; there  were  grounds
    on which the  judge  would  have  been  entitled  to  accept  that  the
    appellant was subject to a warrant and so of continuing interest to the
    authorities; and the UT should assume the judge acted on such  grounds,
    in absence of anything pointing to a contrary conclusion.

 8. Mr Caskie submitted further that the judge at 8.1 set out  the  country
    guidance, including the point now taken the SSHD, showing he was  aware
    of it; the judge recorded at 8.8 that the appellant's  counsel  at  the
    hearing drew attention to �133 of QH, on this issue; there was evidence
    from the appellant in his statement before the judge, responding to the
    point; the judge knew internal relocation might  be  critical,  because
    that was the nub of his decision at 9.14 on "loan sharks"; it  was  not
    to be presumed that in his ultimate decision he had suddenly  forgotten
    all those relevant matters.

 9. Finally, Mr Caskie submitted that if there was an error,  it  would  be
    right to ask Judge Heatherington to correct it.

10. Mr Matthews replied that although a specific finding is not  needed  on
    every aspect of a case, a finding was missing  on  a  plainly  material
    point, which could not be cured by  looking  at  materials  before  the
    judge but which he did not mention.

11. I reserved my decision.

12. The degree of particularity required in a decision can only be resolved
    case by case.

13. This is a plainly methodical, indeed meticulous, step-by-step decision.
     I have no doubt from reading it as a whole that the  judge  knew  that
    internal relocation was a  potential  answer  to  the  claim  based  on
    religion as well as to the claim  based  on  loan  sharking;  that  his
    finding  at  9.13  (v)  that  the  appellant  is   generally   credible
    encompassed his (indirect) evidence about ongoing  interest;  and  that
    decision was based on the full requirements of the guidance being  met.



14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

15. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
