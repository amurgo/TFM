          Notice of withdrawal of case pursuant to paragraph 17 of
       The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as amended)

1. The appellants were granted permission to appeal a decision of the First-
   tier  Tribunal  dismissing  their  appeal  against  a  decision  of   the
   respondent refusing to vary their leave to remain. On 20th December  2013
   they informed the Tribunal,  through  their  representatives,  that  they
   wished to withdraw their appeals.

2. The applicants may withdraw their appeal under rule 17 of the Asylum  and
   Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 (as amended); the consent  of
   the Upper Tribunal is required.

3. The appellants and the respondent were informed that unless a request  to
   the contrary was received by the Tribunal by 4pm on  21st  January  2014,
   the Tribunal would consent to the  withdrawal.  No  request  having  been
   received, this appeal is now withdrawn. There  is  now  no  valid  appeal
   before the Upper Tribunal and the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   stands.

   Date:                                     Signed
