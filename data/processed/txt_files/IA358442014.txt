For the Appellant:     Ms P Yong, Counsel; Greenland Lawyers
For the Claimant: Ms S Sreeraman, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    McIntosh dismissing the Appellant's  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
    decision to refuse him further leave to remain under as a spouse  of  a
    present and settled person, and challenging  removal  directions  under
    section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. The Appellant appealed against that decision and was granted permission
    to appeal by First-tier Tribunal Judge A. K. Simpson. The grounds  upon
    which permission was granted may be summarised as follows:

      i) It is arguable that the  judge  erred  in  considering  matters  no
         relevant to the issue, particularly as it was  never  suggested  by
         the Respondent that the Appellant and his British wife are not in a
         genuine and subsisting relationship and as they are  now  expecting
         their first child; and

     ii) It is arguable that the judge erred in assuming  that  the  British
         sponsor would be granted a visa to  join  her  husband  in  Nigeria
         given that she is not a Nigerian national.

 3. I was provided with a Rule 24 response from the Respondent.

    Error of Law

 4. At the close of submissions,  I  indicated  that  I  would  reserve  my
    decision, which I shall now give. I find that there was an error of law
    in the decision, such that it should be set aside. My  reasons  for  so
    finding are as follows.

 5. The history underlying the  appeal  shows  that  the  Respondent  never
    sought  to  challenge  the  subsistence  of  relationship  between  the
    Appellant and his spouse in the Refusal Letter. It is  trite  that  the
    Respondent can alter the basis for her refusal of  the  application  or
    take issue with further matters on appeal, having put the Appellant  on
    notice and a fair opportunity being given to the Appellant to deal with
    such matters. On that note, ï¿½15 of the determination does not  disclose
    that the Presenting Officer raised the issue of the marriage not  being
    genuine and subsisting in her closing submissions (or earlier in cross-
    examination). Therefore, it is unclear why the judge embarked  upon  an
    assessment of a rule which was not in issue. Ms Sreeraman asked  me  to
    find that the judge was entitled to raise any issue of their own accord
    ad hoc pursuant to RM (Kwok On Tong: HC395 para 320) India [2006] UKAIT
    00039. I wholly reject that submission as that is not the ratio of that
    reported determination. The most pertinent passage from the decision of
    Upper Tribunal Judge Ockelton states inter alia as follows at [10]:

         "In Kwok On Tong (and also in R v IAT ex parte Hubbard  [1985]  Imm
         AR 110) the Court had to  consider  what  the  position  was  if  a
         refusal of entry clearance was based on one element of  the  Rules,
         but by the time of the hearing it became apparent  that  there  was
         some other requirement of the Rules which the appellant  could  not
         meet. Both those cases decide that the notice  of  refusal  is  not
         equivalent to a pleading; if new elements of the Immigration  Rules
         come into play they are to be dealt with on  the  appeal,  and  the
         parties must be allowed any appropriate  adjournment  in  order  to
         avoid the injustice of being taken by surprise..."

 6. In short, new issues under the Rules may come into play,  however  that
    must be at the instigation of the parties, particularly where they  are
    both represented. I reject the suggestion  that  an  independent  judge
    hearing an appeal may descend into the arena to raise an issue  against
    one party where the other has not explicitly sought to  do  so.  For  a
    judge to do so, in my view this result in a party being in  a  position
    to allege there had been an appearance of or reasonable apprehension of
    bias (see Alubankudi (Appearance  of  bias)  [2015]  UKUT  542  (IAC)).
    Whilst neither party has gone so far as to suggest that  here,  I  find
    that the judge has erred in raising an issue which was not taken by the
    Respondent  and  finding  against  the  Appellant   on   that   matter,
    particularly where it is further unclear from the determination whether
    this issue was raised by the Respondent nor whether any notice  of  the
    issue was given to the Appellant by the Respondent.

 7. I find that the judge's decision on the Appellant's article  8  matters
    outwith the Rules are infected by the view taken against the  Appellant
    of his genuine and subsisting relationship.

 8. Given my findings on this first ground, I do not propose or need to  go
    on and consider the remainder.

 9. In the light of the above  findings,  I  set  aside  the  decision  and
    findings of the judge in totality.

    Decision

10. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.

11. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside and the appeal  is
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal,  to  be  heard  by  a  differently
    constituted bench.

    Anonymity

12. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity order and I  was  not
    asked to make one and do not see reason to do so at present.
