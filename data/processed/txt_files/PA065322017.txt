For the Appellant:     Mr Noor, instructed by Visa and Immigration Ltd
For the Respondent:    Miss Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Shannae Rattary, was born on 22 January 1997  and  is  a
    female citizen of Jamaica.  By  a  decision  dated  5  July  2017,  the
    Secretary of State refused the appellant's application for asylum.  The
    appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Beg) which,  in  a
    decision promulgated on 4  August  2017,  dismissed  the  appeal.   The
    appellant now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. We find that the First-tier Tribunal  decision  should  be  set  aside.
    Miss Everett, who appeared for the Secretary of  State,  accepted  that
    the appellant had  not  received  notice  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    hearing.  The notice of that  hearing  was  sent  to  the  Yarl's  Wood
    Detention Centre on 10 July 2017, the same day upon which the appellant
    was released from detention on bail.  The appellant  states  that  that
    the notice of hearing was never forwarded to  her  from  the  Detention
    Centre and we have no reason to disbelieve that statement.  Because she
    did not receive the notice of hearing, the appellant did not attend  to
    give evidence at her appeal.  As a consequence, the appellant has  been
    denied a fair hearing of her appeal.  We therefore set aside the First-
    tier Tribunal decision.  There will need to be a fresh  hearing  before
    the First-tier Tribunal on a date to be fixed.

Notice of Decision

 3. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  which  was  promulgated  on  4
    August 2017 is set aside.  None of the findings of  fact  shall  stand.
    The appeal is returned to the First-tier Tribunal (not Judge  Beg)  for
    that Tribunal to remake the decision.
