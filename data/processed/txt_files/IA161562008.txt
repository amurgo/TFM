                         UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE DAWSON

                                   Between

                            Omer Hassan Suleyman

                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


                                  DECISION

1.    On 21 October a memorandum and directions were sent to the parties in
the following   terms:


      1.  On  18  March  2009   Upper   Tribunal   Judge   Freeman   ordered
         reconsideration of  the  Tribunal  decision  under  s.103A  of  the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

      2. The matter thereafter  came  before  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Storey
         (together with a related appeal - AA/06564/2007) on  3  March  2011
         when further directions were made.

      3. The next development was the listing of the appeal for the decision
         to be remade on 16 June 2014 which was adjourned with a view to the
         case being listed for  country  guidance.   On  16  July  2014  the
         Secretary of State gave notification of withdrawal of the  decision
         under appeal.  The appellant's appeal was dismissed by  the  First-
         tier Tribunal for reasons given in its decision dated  26  February
         2009.  That decision has been set aside.  Notwithstanding this  new
         decision of the Secretary of State, the appellant's appeal  remains
         pending before the Upper Tribunal.

      4. There has been no proposal or  comment  by  the  appellant  or  his
         representatives with regard to the decision  of  the  Secretary  of
         State of 16 July 2014.  In any event Rule  17(2)  of  the  Tribunal
         Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008  provides  that  the  Upper
         Tribunal's consent is necessary for a party to withdraw its case.

      5. Having regard to the Secretary of State's decision to withdraw  the
         underlying immigration decision, any future decision by  the  Upper
         Tribunal in the appeal will be academic as the Secretary  of  State
         has no power to remove the appellant without a further  immigration
         decision which will give rise to a further right of appeal.

      6. Accordingly unless within  five  working  days  of  the  date  this
         memorandum is sent out a proposal to the contrary is  received,  it
         will be assumed that the appellant no wishes to pursue  his  appeal
         in the Upper Tribunal which will be dismissed.

2.  There has been no response from the parties. Accordingly this appeal  is
    dismissed.




Signed                                  Date 8 December 2014
