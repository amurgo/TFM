                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although this is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer ("ECO"),  for
    convenience I will refer to the parties as  they  appeared  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who was born on 19 March 1984.

 3. The appellant made an application for a  family  permit  as  a  "family
    member" of an EEA national, namely  her  mother,  Esther  Osemwengi,  a
    Spanish national exercising treaty rights in  the  UK.   On  20  August
    2019, the ECO refused that application under reg 12 (read with  reg  7)
    of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016 (SI 2016/1052).  The ECO  was
    not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  had  established  that  she   was
    'dependent' upon the EEA sponsor in the UK.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 4. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In that appeal, her
    nephew (a grandchild of the sponsor) who had also been refused a family
    permit was treated as a dependent of the appellant and his claim to  be
    decided in line with that of the appellant.

 5.  The  sole  issue  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  whether  the
    appellant, as a direct descendent of the sponsor but aged over 21,  was
    dependent upon the sponsor (reg 7(1)(b)(ii)).  DJ McClure  allowed  the
    appellant's appeal.  He found that the appellant was dependent upon the
    sponsor and hence had established that she was a 'family member' of her
    EEA sponsor under reg 7(1)(b)(ii) and entitled to a family permit under
    reg 12(1).

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 6. The ECO sought permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  challenging
    the judge's finding that the appellant was dependent upon the  sponsor,
    essentially on the basis that the judge had made inconsistent  findings
    and had given inadequate reasons for reaching his conclusion.

 7. On 12 January 2021, the First-tier Tribunal (RJ Zucker) granted the ECO
    permission to appeal.

 8. Following directions issued by the Upper Tribunal on 26  January  2021,
    the appeal was listed for a remote hearing at the Cardiff Civil Justice
    Centre on 6 May 2021.  The appellant was represented by Ms  Hashmi  and
    the ECO was represented by  Ms  Pettersen,  both  of  whom  joined  the
    hearing by Skype.

The Judge's Reasons

 9. The judge recognised that the sole issue to be decided was whether  the
    appellant had established that she was "dependent" upon the sponsor  in
    the UK.  Having set out the relevant law and some of the  evidence,  at
    paras 24-34 the judge dealt with the evidence concerning the  financial
    support provided to the appellant, as it was claimed, by the sponsor as
    follows:

         "24. In giving evidence the sponsor stated that the  appellant  was
             not working; that the appellant had no other source of income;
             that she had no savings; and that  she  was  wholly  dependent
             upon the money sent  from  the  UK  to  Nigeria  by  her,  the
             sponsor.

         25.  It would have been helpful to  see  the  rent,  the  household
             bills  and  the  other  costs,   e.g.   education   costs   if
             appropriate.  None of the bills have  been  provided  nor  any
             account of how the monies are used to meet the  outgoings  for
             this family.  No explanation is given why  specifically  large
             amounts are sent sometimes and modest amounts other times.

         26.  The sponsor has asserted the appellant did not have any  other
             source of income.  However there are significant gaps  in  the
             records.  It would have been an advantage to know what some of
             the outgoings of the  appellant  were  and  how  the  payments
             relate to the household expenses  of  the  appellant  and  her
             child.

         27.  There are no receipts during the period of 2018.  In  2017  in
             July a sum equivalent to about �350 was sent  but  then  there
             are no receipts until December 2017 when 2 lots of  money  are
             sent, one shortly after the other.  No explanation  was  given
             as to why 2 lots of money were sent.  The first was over  �300
             and the second just 5 days later was for over �400.   How  did
             those monies relate to the outgoings of  the  appellant.   Was
             the appellant paying for rent on a yearly basis or what  other
             household expense was involved?

         28.  As stated there are no receipts for  the  period  of  December
             2017 to April 2019.  What was the appellant doing during  that
             period of time.  How was the appellant supporting herself  and
             her child.

         29.  Similarly in 2019 payments start again on 18 April but then on
             30 April there is a payment of �200 followed by a payment  the
             next day on 1 May 2019 of over �400.  No explanation was given
             as to why 2 large sums of money were paid so  close  together.
             Again was the appellant paying for the yearly rent?

         30.  Also looking at the earnings of the sponsor at that  time,  it
             indicates that she was earning  �223.90  per  week.   Yet  the
             sponsor was giving the appellant the equivalent  of  3  weeks'
             income.  Where did that money come from?

         31.  After the payment in May 2019 there are payments, each of �200
             plus in June and July but then no payment in August.  There is
             a payment in September of �100 and then in October of �100 but
             no payment in November.  At  that  stage  the  appellant,  her
             child and her nephew would be living on  �25.00  per  week  or
             over two months  at  the  lowest  �12.50  per  week.   Without
             explanation of the outgoings of the appellant and her family I
             do not accept that the appellant, her child and  nephew  would
             be able to live on �12.50 per week without  evidence  of  what
             their outgoings were.

         32.  I find it significant that  there  is  not  a  consistent  and
             regular amount of money being sent.  The cost of living, food,
             clothing and the like would be regular outgoings  which  would
             have to be met.  Accommodation may be paid  for  on  a  yearly
             basis such that  a  single  large  payment  may  be  made  but
             otherwise I do not accept that the appellant,  her  child  and
             nephew could have lived on �12.50 per week.

         33.  There were many  issues  unanswered  in  the  evidence.   That
             having been said I do not accept that the monies sent  by  the
             sponsor were the only source of money for  the  appellant  and
             her family.  It was suggested it  was  not  possible  for  the
             appellant to earn monies because she  had to  look  after  her
             child.  Many women with children work.  The appellant and  her
             family I find must have had other  sources  of  income.   That
             would not stop the family needing to supplement  their  income
             to meet the basics of life by monies from the sponsor.   Given
             the income of the sponsor, I find that the sponsor is  sending
             money on a regular basis to enable the appellant to  meet  her
             and her child's basic needs.

         34.  Having considered  all  the  circumstances  I  find  that  the
             appellant and her family may have a limited income from  other
             sources but that they need  the  money  from  the  sponsor  to
             enable them to meet their basic needs.  I find to that  extent
             that it has been proved that the appellant and her family were
             dependent on  the  sponsor.   I  find  they  are  sufficiently
             dependent to fall for  consideration  under  Regulation  7  as
             family members that are dependent upon the monies from the EEA
             sponsor in the UK.  On that basis I allow the  appeal  of  the
             appellant."

The Submissions

10. On behalf of the ECO, Ms Pettersen relied upon the  grounds  which  she
    briefly developed in her oral  submissions.   She  submitted  that  the
    judge's finding that the appellant was financially dependent  upon  the
    sponsor to meet the  appellant's  "essential  needs"  was  inadequately
    reasoned.

11. First, the judge had identified a number of gaps in  the  evidence  and
    the  circumstances  of  the  appellant,  including   inconsistent   and
    irregular remittances sent by the sponsor.   Secondly,  the  judge  had
    rejected the sponsor's evidence that the appellant  had  no  income  or
    savings and was wholly dependent upon the sponsor.   He  also  rejected
    the evidence that the appellant and her family were able to survive  on
    funds sent by the sponsor.  He found that the money sent by the sponsor
    was not the only source of money for  the  appellant  and  her  family.
    Thirdly, nevertheless, he went on to find that the appellant needed the
    money from the sponsor to enable her to meet her "basic needs"  and  so
    was dependent upon the sponsor.  Ms Pettersen  submitted  that  it  was
    wholly unclear how, given the judge's other findings,  he  had  reached
    that ultimate conclusion in the appellant's favour.

12. On behalf of the appellant, Ms Hashmi  submitted  that  the  judge  had
    clearly dealt with all the issues.  He had applied the correct case law
    and, even if there were gaps in the evidence, he had sustainably  found
    that the sponsor was sending money and that this money  was  needed  by
    the appellant to meet her "basic needs".

Discussion

13. The judge correctly identified that proof of  dependency  requires  the
    appellant to establish, on a balance of probabilities,  that  financial
    support from the sponsor was required in order to meet the  appellant's
    "essential needs" (see paras 16 and 17  with  particular  reference  to
    ECO, Manila v Lim [2015] EWCA Civ 1383).

14. However, as will be clear  from  the  judge's  reasons,  he  found  the
    evidence to not be consistent, that there were significant gaps in  the
    evidence and "many issues unanswered" in that  evidence.   He  did  not
    accept that the appellant was wholly reliant upon money  received  from
    the sponsor.  Indeed, when he analysed a period of payments  made,  the
    judge found that relying on money from the sponsor, she  received  only
    �12.50 per week which was not enough for the appellant and  her  family
    to live on.  The judge accepted that  the  appellant  must  have  other
    sources of income although he did not identify what they were.

15. Further, in  the  evidence  the  judge  could  not  identify  what  the
    appellant's living costs were  or  that  she  was  receiving  money  to
    provide for her living costs solely from the sponsor.  Indeed,  to  the
    extent the evidence covered a period of time in 2019, the  judge  found
    that the sponsor was providing about �12.50 per week.  The remainder of
    any living costs were, on the  judge's  findings,  derived  from  other
    sources.  Of course, the judge made no findings on what  those  sources
    were.

16. Nevertheless, in order  to  determine  that  the  sponsor's  money  was
    providing for the appellant's "basic" or "essential needs",  the  judge
    had to assess whether  the  income  solely  derived  from  the  sponsor
    provided for those needs, such as accommodation, food and clothing.  In
    para 32, the  judge,  in  effect,  found  that,  when  considering  the
    relevant period, �12.50 per week was not enough to do that and, indeed,
    the implication is that the remaining (bulk) of support came from other
    sources than the sponsor.  Having identified periods of  time  when  no
    money was evidenced as being sent to the appellant and,  when  it  was,
    that the money was supplemented by other money necessary, at least,  to
    meet the "cost of living, food, clothing and the  like",  I  accept  Ms
    Pettersen's submission that it is wholly unclear how the judge came  to
    the finding that the money sent by the sponsor  enabled  the  appellant
    "to  meet  her  and  her  child's  basic  needs".   Without  a  careful
    assessment of the evidence leading to findings  identifying  what  were
    the costs necessary to  meet  the  appellant's  "basic"  or  "essential
    needs" and then marrying that up with findings as to monies which  were
    sent by the sponsor being used to provide for those  needs,  the  judge
    failed to give adequate reasons for his finding  that,  under  the  EEA
    Regulations, the appellant was "dependent" upon the sponsor in the  UK.



17. For those reasons, the judge erred in law in reaching  his  finding  in
    relation to dependency and that the appellant had established that  she
    is a "family member" of her EEA sponsor in the UK.  For those  reasons,
    the judge's decision to allow the appeal cannot stand and is set aside.

18. Both representatives, accepted that if the error of law was established
    the proper disposal of the appeal was to remit  it  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a fresh hearing.



Decision

19. For the above reasons, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow
    the appellant's appeal involved the making of an error  of  law.   That
    decision cannot stand and is set aside.

20. Having regard to the nature and extent of fact-finding required, and to
    para 7.2 of the  Senior  President's  Practice  Statement,  the  proper
    disposal of this appeal is to remit it to the First-tier Tribunal for a
    de novo rehearing before a judge other than Judge McClure.

                                                                      Signed
