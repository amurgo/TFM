                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a  decision  of  30
    October 2014 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Beach.  In that decision  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  allowed  the  appeal  of  Josephine  Owusu
    Amankrah.  In  part  the  appeal  had  been  under   the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 against the decision dated 19  November
    2013 to refuse to vary leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  and  to
    remove the then appellant from the United Kingdom.

 2. The respondent was not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  fulfilled  the
    requirements of  paragraph  245ZX  of  the  Immigration  Rules  as  the
    appellant did not have the required level of  funds  available  in  her
    bank account for the requisite period of time.

 3. The appellant had contended that she met  the  criteria  for  leave  to
    remain under the points-based system and was entitled  to  a  biometric
    residence permit.

 4. In her judgement the First-tier Tribunal Judge found that in  the  bank
    statements provided as at 30 July 2013, the balance was �980.24 but  as
    from 25 September 2013 the balance was in excess of �15,000.  Under the
    Rules the appellant was required to have  the  sum  of  �6,325  in  her
    account for a continuous 28 day period prior to the  application.   The
    application was dated 7 October 2013.

 5. In her decision the First-tier Tribunal Judge  said  at  paragraph  15,
    having set out the financial  state  of  affairs  which  we  have  just
    summarised, "It is clear then that  the  appellant  cannot  fulfil  the
    requirements of paragraph 245ZX because the funds available to her  via
    her sponsor were less than those required for the 28 day period."

 6. She then said, in paragraph 16:

         "However, the respondent always retains the residual discretion  in
         considering applications and there is no evidence  before  me  that
         there was any consideration of exercising that residual  discretion
         in favour of the appellant given the fact that the bank balance was
         clearly well in excess of the required amount  for  the  last  five
         days of the 28 day period."

 7. As a result her decision was that the appeal was allowed to the limited
    extent that the decision is not in accordance  with  the  law  and  the
    application therefore remains outstanding before the respondent.

 8. On 6 November the respondent appealed on three bases  but  concentrated
    on paragraph 16 of the decision  letter  which  I  have  read  out  and
    paragraph 17.

 9. Paragraph 17 reads:

         "Furthermore, a decision had been made to remove the appellant from
         the United Kingdom but the  respondent  did  not  consider  whether
         there were any private life or exceptional circumstances such  that
         the removal of the appellant was not required."

10. The grounds of appeal which are  relied  upon  are  firstly,  that  the
    learned judge failed to followed established authority as  restated  in
    the case of Marghia [2014] UKUT 366 and, as a result, the judge made an
    error  of  law  in  allowing  the  appeal  as  there  was  no  residual
    discretion.

11. Secondly, there is no discretion within  Immigration  Rule  245ZX  and,
    thirdly, there were no representations made to the Secretary  of  State
    upon which she could exercise a discretion or exceptional circumstances
    brought to her attention to render the decision unlawful.

12. Permission to appeal was given on 17 December 2014.  Those grounds have
    been elaborated by the respondent before us but can be put  succinctly,
    namely, firstly, that there is no residual discretion contained  within
    the Rules.  There is no case law which indicates that the Secretary  of
    State has to expressly articulate that she has considered any  residual
    discretion.   Secondly,  there  is  no  discretion  within  the   Rules
    themselves.

13. The applicant submitted through Mr Paramjorthy that the case of Marghia
    is misguided in its application here because the case had been  allowed
    because of the common-law duty to act on the public  law  principle  of
    fairness which is not the position here. He contends that the  case  of
    Ukus [2012] UKUT 307 is relevant because that deals with  the  position
    where a decision-maker has a discretion which is vested in him and that
    makes it clear that the  exercise  of  that  discretion  is  appealable
    before the Tribunal.

14. Mr Paramjorthy also made it clear that the  case  of  Marghia  was  not
    before the Tribunal when it considered the matters.  Despite  the  able
    way that Mr Paramjorthy has made his submissions we reject them.

15.  The relevant Immigration Rule 245ZX(c) reads:

         "To qualify for leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student under
         this Rule an applicant must meet the requirements listed below.  If
         the applicant meets these requirements  leave  to  remain  will  be
         granted. If the applicant does  not  meet  these  requirements  the
         applicant will be refused."

16. The wording in our judgment of the Rule is clear.  If  the  requirement
    under the Rule is met leave to remain will be granted.  If  it  is  not
    leave to remain will be  refused.   The  Rule,  therefore,  imposes  an
    absolute requirement in two ways. Firstly, on the applicant to meet the
    requirement of the Rule and secondly, on the respondent to grant  leave
    to remain if that requirement is met. If it is not met  the  obligation
    is to refuse leave to remain.   There  is  no  discretion  within  that
    Immigration Rule.  To be granted leave to remain a Tier 4 Migrant  must
    satisfy the Immigration Rules and score  points  against  two  sets  of
    objective criteria to achieve an overall pass mark of 40 points.

17. An applicant's  score  is  made  up  of  two  component  parts.  First,
    Attributes (Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies) in respect of which
    30 points is awarded.   Secondly,  Maintenance  (Funds)  for  which  10
    points is awarded.  In the instant case the applicant scored 30  points
    for the Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies but  nothing  under  the
    heading of maintenance.

18. The initial decision letter of the Secretary of State dated 19 November
    2013 explained that the applicant  needed  to  show  that  she  was  in
    possession of �6,325 for a consecutive period of 28 days  to  meet  the
    Tier 4 (General) Student  Migrant  maintenance  funds  requirements  as
    required under paragraph 1A of Appendix C of the Immigration Rules.  As
    set out the bank statements submitted did not show the requisite amount
    for the required period of time. In other words the funds available  to
    the appellant via her sponsor were less than were required for  the  28
    day period.  As such the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  found  that  the
    applicant could not fulfil the requirements of  Rule  245ZX(c)  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

19. The question then of whether there was any residual  discretion  became
    critical to the success or otherwise of the application.   As the  case
    of Marghia makes clear in paragraph 10 where it says this:

         "It was a matter for the Secretary of State as to  whether  or  not
         she exercised any residual discretion to  permit  the  claimant  to
         have a further Tier 4 visa notwithstanding her clear  inability  to
         meet the criteria set out in the  Rules.   That  exercise  of  such
         residual  discretion  which  does  not  appear  in  the  Rules   is
         absolutely a matter for the Secretary  of  State  and  nobody  else
         including the  court. (See Abdi [1996] ImmAR 148). The Court should
         not have sought to impose its own view. This  trespassed  upon  the
         proper  functions  of  the  executive.  Nor  could  there  be   any
         suggestion of any procedural unfairness in  this  case.   The  mere
         fact that the judge in question  may  have  had  sympathy  for  the
         claimant or regard the substantive decision  of  the  Secretary  of
         State as 'unfair' is not to point."

20. In paragraph 11 the judgment continues:

         "This was a case in which the Rules  were  crystal  clear  and  the
         failure to meet the breach of Rules was manifest.  It was therefore
         open to the Secretary of State to makes the decision that  she  did
         in her decision letter of 12 December  2013,  the  claimant  having
         failed to meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph  245ZX(i)  of  the
         Immigration Rules the judge erred in  law  and  we  set  aside  the
         decision and remake it."

21. As in the case of Marghia it is a matter exclusively for the  Secretary
    of State as to whether she exercises any residual discretion to  permit
    the applicant to  have  a  further  Tier  4  visa  notwithstanding  the
    applicant's inability to meet the Rules. There is no requirement within
    the Rules or any case law which makes it incumbent upon  the  Secretary
    of State to go further and articulate whether she  has  considered  any
    residual discretion which exists outside the Rules and to set  out  the
    basis upon which  she  considered  that  it  was  inappropriate  to  so
    exercise.

22. It follows therefore (1) That on the plain and ordinary language of the
    Rules the applicant was unable  to  comply  with  them.   There  is  no
    residual discretion within the Rules  enabling  a  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge to allow the appeal.  (2) There is no residual discretion outside
    the Rules available to the First-tier Tribunal Judge to enable  her  to
    allow the appeal.  In those circumstances ground 3 falls away but we do
    note that there was in fact no material before the Secretary  of  State
    in any event upon  which  any  residual  discretion  could   have  been
    exercised.

23. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
    law and is set aside. In the circumstances of this case, the inevitable
    consequence of this is that we  substitute  a  decision  dismissing  Ms
    Owusu-Amakrah's appeal to the First Tier Tribunal.  For  those  reasons
    we allow this appeal.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed.
