Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr Dieu, instructed by NC Brothers & Co Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State but nonetheless for the purposes of this decision we shall  refer
    to the parties as they were described before the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    that is Mr Pun  and  Miss  Garbuja  Pun,  as  the  appellants  and  the
    Secretary of State as the respondent.

 2. The appellants are nationals of Nepal and have  each  appealed  against
    the respondent's decision made on 22nd  January  2016  to  refuse  them
    entry clearance to the United Kingdom as the children of Mrs Chanamati,
    their mother and sponsor.

 3. The applicants were born  on  20th  June  1986  and  7th January  1989
    respectively and are now 31 and 29 years old.  The appellants were born
    in Nepal and have lived there all their lives.  Their father served  in
    the Ghurkhas from 1964 to 1969 and following  his  discharge  from  the
    army returned to Nepal where he worked as a labourer, and  helped  with
    farming.  During  their  marriage  the  sponsor  and  Mr  Pun  had  six
    children, all of whom live in Nepal.  Sadly, Mr Pun died  in  1989  and
    the sponsor continued to live in Nepal after her husband's death.   She
    came to the United Kingdom in November 2011 following the  decision  to
    allow former Ghurkhas and their dependants to settle, and she has lived
    here ever since.  By the time the concession was  introduced  in  2015,
    her older children  were  too  old  to  benefit  from  the  concession.
    Following a new concession, the  appellants  applied  to  come  to  the
    United Kingdom.  On the sponsor's account, Mr Pun would  have  come  to
    the United Kingdom after he left the army had the option been  open  to
    him.

 4. Following a detailed recitation of the facts and her  findings,  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge O'Hagan found that a family  life  existed  between
    the sponsor and the appellants and in the light of Gurung v SSHD [2013]
    EWCA Civ 8 and Ghising (Ghurkhas BOCs  -historic  wrong-weight)  [2013]
    UKUT 00567 allowed the appeal on human rights grounds under Article  8,
    ECHR.

    Grounds of appeal

 5. The Secretary of State applied for permission to  appeal  against  that
    decision asserting in effect three grounds

    (i)    material misdirection of law.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge had
         found  the  appellants  to   be   dependent   upon   their   mother
         "emotionally, financially and practically" paragraph  11,  although
         does not appear  to  have  had  any  regard  for  the  evidence  of
         financial remittances made to the appellants  or  any  evidence  of
         communication such  as  phone  cards,  of  text  messages  and  the
         mother's own testimony was that she speaks on the  phone  with  the
         appellants weekly or  fortnightly.   It  was  submitted  that  this
         limited evidence did not demonstrate emotional  dependence  to  the
         Kugathas standard.  The Entry Clearance  Officer  did  not  dispute
         that some  family  life  existed  between  the  appellant  and  his
         sponsors, simply  that  the  evidence  did  not  show  elements  of
         dependency beyond the normal emotional  ties  between  adults.   It
         could be considered fairly normal for all adult children  to  speak
         with their parents on the phone once  a  week.   There  had  to  be
         something more.  As set out in AAO and the Entry Clearance  Officer
         [2011] EWCA Civ 840, paragraph 35

             "As for the position of  parents  and  adult  children  it  is
             established that family life will not normally  exist  between
             them within the meaning of Article 8 at all in the absence  of
             further  elements  of  dependency  which  go   beyond   normal
             emotional ties"

    (ii)   the judge did not appear to have considered that the mother  was
         on benefits in the United Kingdom and although she may be  able  to
         afford some support to the appellants in Nepal where  the  cost  of
         living was lower that would not be the same in the United  Kingdom.
         The judge had no regard for Section 117B and no findings were  made
         on whether the appellants could speak English or maintain financial
         independence in the United Kingdom; and

    (iii)  the judge accepted the mother's assertion that the husband, were
         it not for the historical injustice of Ghurkha  settlement  policy,
         would have come to the UK on his retirement and significant  weight
         was given to that assertion; the judge went on to find in favour of
         the appellants based entirely on this  finding;  and  as  such  the
         judge had failed to make a balanced proportionality assessment.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Mark
    Davies, stating that "it is arguable that the  judge's  conclusions  in
    finding that a family life existed between  the  appellants  and  their
    sponsor is flawed taking into account the guidance given in the case of
    Kugathas".

    Legal Policy and Context

 7. The applicable  principles  are  well  established  and  were  recently
    reviewed and restated in  Rai  (Jitendra)  v  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    [2017] EWCA Civ 320.  Some key points are that:

      1) the burden of proof lies on the Appellant, to show  that  a  family
         life protected under the European Convention  on  Human  Rights  is
         engaged on the balance of probabilities.  The  Secretary  of  State
         must show that the decision is proportionate;

      2) it is not enough to show the normal emotional ties  that  would  be
         expected between a parent and their  adult  child;  something  more
         must be shown: Kugathas and the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
         Department [2003] EWCA Civ 31.  Sedley said in paragraph 17 of  his
         judgment that

             "If dependency is read  down  as  meaning  'support',  in  the
             personal sense,  and  if  one  adds,  echoing  the  Strasbourg
             jurisprudence, 'real' or 'committed'  or  'effective'  to  the
             word 'support' then it represents ... the irreducible  minimum
             of what family life implies"

      3) one factor that is relevant, though not determinative,  is  whether
         the adult child has formed a family of his or her own,  Gurung  and
         the Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA  Civ  8;



      4) the judgments in  Kugathas  should  not  necessarily  be  read  too
         restrictively;

      5) in the end, the assessment is a holistic one and ultimately as  per
         Lord Dyson MR in Guring "[it] all depends  on  the  facts".   There
         should be a careful consideration of the facts in the case;

      6) as Sir Stanley Burnton said in Singh and the Secretary of State for
         the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 630

             "There is no legal or factual presumption as to the  existence
             or absence of family life for the purposes of  Article  8  ...
             the love and affection between an adult  and  his  parents  or
             siblings will not of itself justify a finding of family  life.
             There has to be something more."

    The Judge's decision

 8. The judge in his/her decision set out the key points why the respondent
    or Entry Clearance Officer had  essentially  refused  the  application.
    The appellants did not fall within the ambit  of  the  policy  and  the
    refusal did not breach the  duties  arising  under  Section  8  of  the
    European Convention on Human  Rights  albeit  regard  was  had  to  the
    guidance set out in Gurung and Others [2013] EWCA  Civ  8  and  Ghising
    (Gurkhas BOCs historic wrong weight) [2013] UKUT 0056.

 9. The judge also recorded that  at  the  hearing  she  ensured  that  the
    sponsor had read the evidence in her statement through  the  assistance
    of the court interpreter.

10. The evidence elicited was as follows

      i) the sponsor had visited Nepal since being  in  the  United  Kingdom
         three times for three months each time;

     ii) she maintains contact with the children by  telephone.   She  calls
         them once a week and sometimes every two  weeks.   Some  calls  are
         longer and some shorter.  She does not keep in touch by  any  other
         means;

    iii) the sponsor came to the  United  Kingdom  because  she  was  having
         financial problems in Nepal;

     iv) she has four sons and two daughters all of whom live in Nepal.  She
         had applied for only two because they were the ones under  the  age
         of 30.  She was unsure of their level of education but thought they
         might have studied to grade 7;

      v) the sponsor explains they did not work  but  they  did  help  on  a
         neighbour's farm for which  they  were  paid  in  food.   She  last
         visited almost a year ago and they were in good health.

11. The judge identified in his/her analysis, findings and conclusions that
    the first issue the  appellants  had  to  establish  was  whether  they
    enjoyed family and/or private life in the United Kingdom  in  order  to
    engage Article 8(1).  The judge cited Jitendra (Rai v  Entry  Clearance
    Officer [2017] EWCA Civ 320) and specifically  cited  paragraph  42  as
    follows

         "42.     Those circumstances of the appellant and his  family,  all
             of them uncontentious, and including - perhaps crucially - the
             fact that he and his parents would have applied  at  the  same
             time for leave to enter the United Kingdom and would have come
             to the United Kingdom together as a family unit had they  been
             able to afford to do so, do not appear to have  been  grappled
             with by the Upper Tribunal judge under  article  8(1).  In  my
             view they should have been. They went  to  the  heart  of  the
             matter: the question of whether, even though  the  appellant's
             parents had chosen to leave Nepal  to  settle  in  the  United
             Kingdom when they did, his family  life  with  them  subsisted
             then, and was still  subsisting  at  the  time  of  the  Upper
             Tribunal's decision. This  was  the  critical  question  under
             article 8(1)."

12. At paragraph 25, the judge identified that it was not in  dispute  that
    the appellants and their sponsor were biologically  related  and  noted
    that the question was whether "there  was  anything  that  goes  beyond
    that".  The judge then set out the following findings:

         "26.     Before the sponsor came to the United Kingdom in 2011, she
             and the appellants lived together in the same  household.  The
             appellants have never married, and have never worked, save for
             casual work helping out on a farm for which they were paid  in
             food rather than  money.  I  find  that  they  had  formed  no
             independent life of their own at the  time  when  the  sponsor
             left. Notwithstanding their  respective  ages,  they  remained
             dependent  on  their  mother,  emotionally,  financially   and
             practically. I am satisfied that there was family life between
             them at that time. That view is reinforced by  the  fact  that
             the sponsor continued living in Nepal until mid-2011,  despite
             having been in a  position  to  come  to  the  United  Kingdom
             sooner, because she wanted to  stay  with  her  children.  She
             said, and I accept, that she did not want to leave them;  need
             drove her to do so because she had no money.

         27.      The question is whether that has continued  through  until
             the present  time.  The  strongest  point  in  favour  of  the
             respondent's view that  it  has  not  is  the  fact  that  the
             appellants and the  sponsor  have  lived  apart  in  different
             countries since 2011. That is a  factor  that  weighs  on  the
             respondent's side in the assessment. I turn to  consider  the
             factors which favour the appellants' case that they  have  had
             continuing family  life.   The  appellants'  circumstances  in
             Nepal have  remained  unchanged  in  that  they  have  neither
             married nor formed an independent family life  of  their  own.
             They remain financially dependent on the sponsor.  I  note  Ms
             Akhtar's argument that  the  degree  of  financial  dependence
             could not be so great because the only income that the sponsor
             has is from welfare benefits,  and  she  cannot  provide  much
             support from that given that the money paid is sufficient  for
             one person only. The difficulty with that argument is that  it
             overlooks the difference in  the  value  of  money  between  a
             relatively wealth country such as this,  and  a  poor  country
             such as Nepal.  The sponsor has  visited  her  children  three
             times since coming to the United Kingdom,  staying  for  three
             months each time. That is a relatively high number of  lengthy
             visits.  I accept she could not have spent  more  time  there
             without prejudicing  her  benefit  entitlement.  Her  evidence
             concerning telephone contact suggests a more modest degree  of
             contact, but the phone records indicate that the actual  level
             of contact is higher than she herself recalled to me.

         28.      Having considered the evidence as a whole, I am  satisfied
             that this is a case in which there  is  the  "something  more"
             described by Sir Stanley Burnton in Singh v SSHD  [2015]  EWCA
             Civ 630. In my view, it is sufficient to support a finding  of
             continuing family life at, and beyond, the point of engagement
             of article 8(1). I am also  satisfied  that  the  respondent's
             decision interferes with the right to respect for family  life
             at and beyond the threshold of engagement for article 8(1)."

    Submissions

13. At the hearing before us, Mr Avery conceded that the central issue  and
    real challenge in this appeal was whether the judge had made sufficient
    findings to establish family life  under  the  European  Convention  on
    Human Rights.  He did not quibble with the judge's  assessment  of  the
    law. The question was whether there was family life between the sponsor
    and the appellants in Nepal.  Nothing showed that  the  judge  grappled
    with the real test, and he pointed out that there  were  no  statements
    made by either of the appellants included in the bundle.

14. Mr Dieu referred to the money transfer receipts which were included  in
    the bundle to show the financial support afforded by the sponsor to the
    appellants, and referred us to paragraph 10 of  the  sponsor's  witness
    statement.  The sponsor confirmed that she  was  supporting  her  sons;
    neither of her sons had work  in  Nepal.   He  submitted  there  was  a
    careful analysis of the law and that the judge had  applied  this.   He
    submitted that the  respondent  had  taken  issue  with  the  depth  of
    evidence to show family life, and it was not  a  high  threshold.   The
    quality of the evidence was sufficient.  He argued that even if it  was
    the case that there were no statements from the children it was  enough
    to take the evidence from the sponsor.

15. Mr Avery in response pointed out that there was no 'lower  standard  of
    proof' and historic  injustice  did  not  "bite"  until  the  protected
    Article 8 right was shown to  exist.   There  must  be  established  an
    'Article 8 right' from the outset.

16. We identified that there was a reference within  the  decision  of  the
    judge, at paragraph 19 to the witness  statements  of  the  appellants.
    The judge had this to say

         "19.     'As is inevitably the case in considering  an  application
             for entry clearance, it was not possible for me to  hear  from
             the appellants themselves. They  are  in  Nepal,  awaiting  my
             decision as to whether they can enter the  United  Kingdom.  I
             have, however, had  the  opportunity  to  read  their  witness
             statements, to hear from the Sponsor, and to hear from Counsel
             acting for them'."

    At this point in the hearing we put the matter back  so  that  Mr  Dieu
    could establish whether  witness  statements  had  indeed  been  filed,
    because they were not evident from the  index  of  documentation  filed
    before the First-tier Tribunal  and  had  not  been  filed  as  further
    evidence for the hearing before the Upper Tribunal.

17. After a short recess, Mr Dieu confirmed that there  was  no  indication
    that  the  solicitors,  whom  he  had  contacted,  had  filed   witness
    statements on behalf of  the  appellants.   He  surmised  that  it  was
    possible that the appellants may have submitted or tendered  statements
    to the Entry Clearance Officer, but that these had not been provided.

    Analysis, Findings and Conclusion

18. At the hearing, we asked Mr Dieu and Mr Avery  whether,  should  we  be
    minded to find a material error of law and remake the  decision,  there
    was any further evidence to be submitted.  We note  that  the  standard
    directions had been served, such  that  any  further  evidence  should,
    pursuant to Rule 15(2)(a), have been sent by the  parties  ten  working
    days prior to the hearing at the latest.  The directions were issued to
    the parties on 17th January 2018.

19. As we have indicated, Mr Avery abandoned his challenge in  relation  to
    the second and third grounds and  concentrated  on  whether  sufficient
    findings were made in  respect  of  family  life.   The  judge  in  her
    analysis, findings and conclusions, appeared to have relied on  witness
    statements from the appellants which were not in  existence.   That  to
    our mind is a clear error of law because not only did the judge proceed
    on an erroneous factual basis, but she appeared to  take  into  account
    evidence which was not available which must have had a bearing  on  the
    finding regarding family life.

20. We therefore remake the decision.

21. The legal principles are, as we have identified above clearly sent  out
    Rai (Jitendra) and Kugathas v UK [2003] EWCA 31.  Paragraphs 17 and  18
    of  Rai  neatly  encapsulate  the  law,   confirm  that  there  is   no
    presumption of family life, and expand as follows:

         "[17]    the "relevant factors ... include identifying who are  the
         near relatives of the appellant, the nature of  the  links  between
         them and the appellant, the age of the appellant,  where  and  with
         whom he has resided in the past, and the forms of  contact  he  has
         maintained with the other members of the family with whom he claims
         to have a family life". She acknowledged  (at  paragraph  25)  that
         "there is no presumption of family life". Thus "a  family  life  is
         not established between an adult child and his surviving parent  or
         other siblings unless something more exists than  normal  emotional
         ties". She added that "[such] ties might  exist  if  the  appellant
         were dependent on his family or vice versa", but it  was  "not  ...
         essential that the members of the family  should  be  in  the  same
         country"."

22. The appellants made their applications for settlement on  18th  January
    2016, when they were 29 and 27 years of age respectively.  The evidence
    from the sponsor was that they had lived with their mother until  2011,
    when she came to the United Kingdom.  They have four other siblings who
    live in Nepal and who are older than them.

23. We accept that there was family life between them prior to the  sponsor
    leaving Nepal in mid-2011.  The question is whether they have continued
    to maintain a  family  life  with  the  sponsor,  and  have  formed  no
    independent lives of their own since the sponsor left.  We place little
    weight on the fact that the sponsor voluntarily left Nepal because,  as
    she states, her circumstances were such that she needed to relocate for
    welfare benefits.  We do note  the  argument  made  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, that the remittances sent to the appellants must  be  limited
    because the only income the sponsor has is from a  meagre  pension  and
    her welfare benefits, which would limit the  extent  of  the  financial
    support she might provide to  her  children.   However,  as  the  judge
    pointed out in the First-tier Tribunal  decision,  that  overlooks  the
    difference in the value of money between a relatively  wealthy  country
    such as the United Kingdom and a poorer country such as Nepal.

24.  We  have  considered  the  documentation  supplied,  in  the  form  of
    remittances and note the limited remittances that have  been  provided.
    There appeared to be eighteen remittances, commencing  in  March  2015.
    There were two remittances on 2nd March 2015,  each  for  approximately
    �31, two on 3rd April 2015 each for approximately �31, two on  5th  May
    2015 each for approximately �20, two on 8th July 2015 for approximately
    �20, two on 4th September  2015  for  approximately  �19,  one  on  5th
    September 2015 for approximately �20,  one  on  5th  October  2015  for
    approximately �20, two on 8th January 2016 for approximately  �33,  and
    two on 7th March 2016 for approximately �23, one on 1st  December  2016
    for approximately �32, and one on 10th May 2017 for �300.  There was no
    further  evidence  of  financial  remittances  placed  before  us.   In
    particular, we notice a gap in the remittances between March  2016  and
    December 2016.  That undermines the suggestion of  sustained  financial
    assistance.

25. We have taken into account the statement of the sponsor, and assume  in
    favour of the appellants that her reference to her sons, as opposed  to
    a daughter and son, is an  error  in  interpretation.   She  states  at
    paragraph 13 that her "sons" have only been able to work  as  labourers
    but the work is not regular and was also poorly paid.  It would  appear
    that in her evidence to  the  judge  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal  she
    advised the appellants were paid with food.

26. We note the call log, showing  a  variety  of  calls  to  Nepal  and  a
    preponderance of certain telephone numbers.  Some of the calls last for
    a matter of seconds.  Most are voice calls, and the  calls  range  from
    12th January 2016 to 8th June 2017.  We note that  the  judge  recorded
    that the appellants' evidence concerning telephone contact "suggests  a
    more modest degree of contact, but the phone records indicate that  the
    actual level of contact is higher than  she  herself  recalled  to  me"
    although we note  that  there  were  a  variety  of  telephone  numbers
    included in the record.

27. We appreciate that the sponsor speaks to  her  family  in  Nepal  on  a
    regular basis and we accept that the sponsor has visited the appellants
    and all her family in Nepal on three occasions, owing  to  the  airline
    tickets in support.

28. What we cannot reconcile with the appellants'  case,  however,  is  the
    lack of witness statements from the appellants themselves.  To show and
    demonstrate the very basic element of family  life  beyond  the  normal
    emotional ties between adults we would conclude that there would indeed
    be witness statements made by the appellants to show  their  attachment
    to and level of dependence on their mother.  In the  absence  of  these
    statements which we did draw to the attention of  the  representatives,
    we are not satisfied that family life has been established.  This is an
    appeal by the appellants  themselves  and,  albeit  we  have  carefully
    considered the statement of the sponsor and the evidence  produced,  we
    conclude that it is not enough - on the facts of this case - to  adduce
    evidence from the sponsor that a family life exists. There needs to  be
    some form of acknowledgement of dependence from the appellants. That is
    not evident from their applications.  We have also  concluded  that  in
    the financial remittances there is an extensive gap between  March  and
    December 2016.

29. We therefore find that the appellants have failed to establish a family
    life that  needs  to  be  assessed  in  the  context  of  the  historic
    injustice.   The  'historic  wrong'  will  ordinarily   determine   the
    proportionality assessment, where the respondent  only  relies  on  the
    immigration policy as a legitimate aim.  Gurung confirms that where the
    respondent is relying only on the public interest, then the  weight  to
    be given to the historic injustice would normally require a decision in
    the appellants' favour.

30. That however is not the whole picture here, and we have to consider not
    only the proportionality  exercise  in  the  absence  of  the  historic
    injustice consideration, but also s 117 of the Nationality  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 as follows.

          '117B   Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in
         all cases

         (1)      The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in
         the public interest.

         (2)      It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

             (a)       are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)       are better able to integrate into society.

         (3)      It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are
         financially independent, because such persons-

             (a)       are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)       are better able to integrate into society.

             ...'

31. It is clear that the appellants would be entirely financially dependent
    on the sponsor who is already in receipt of public  benefits.   Nor  is
    there any indication that the appellants  can  speak  English.  Indeed,
    they did not submit statements or any other indication  that  they  had
    any facility with the English language.  That needs to  be  taken  into
    account in striking the balance.

32. We take into account the evident connection between the sponsor and her
    children and her rights under Beoku-Betts v SSHD [2008] UKHL 39 but  we
    conclude that the status quo may  continue,  and  it  is  open  to  the
    sponsor to keep in touch via modern methods and through visits, as  she
    has previously done. The appellants have their siblings in Nepal  whom,
    no doubt, the sponsor will wish to visit.

33. We are not persuaded that any private life exists in this instance  and
    even if it does, as identified by the Court of Appeal  in  Pun  v  SSHD
    [2017] EWCA Civ 2106, historic  injustice  would  be  given  even  less
    weight in private life cases.  The appellants have  their  siblings  in
    Nepal, they have some very limited support  from  the  sponsor  in  the
    United Kingdom, and again Section 117B(1) would weigh  heavily  against
    them in their appeal.

34. Following the guidance in Huang v SSHD [2007]  UKHL  11,  we  were  not
    persuaded that taking full account of all considerations, the  decision
    of the Entry Clearance  Officer  prejudiced  the  family  life  of  the
    appellants in a manner sufficiently serious to amount to  a  breach  of
    their Article 8 rights.

35. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified.   We  set  aside
    the decision pursuant to Section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007) and remake the decision  under  section
    12(2) (b) (ii) of the TCE 2007.
