Representation:

For the appellant:         Mr Z  Nasim,  of  Counsel,  instructed  by  Legal
                 Rights Partnership.
For the respondent:    Ms. A Holmes, Senior Presenting Officer.

                           Decision and Directions


 1. The appellants appeal, with permission, against a decision of Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Nixon who, following a hearing  on  7  December
    2017, dismissed their appeals against the respondent's decisions of  22
    November 2016 by which he refused to issue  family  permits  under  the
    Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  2006  (hereafter   the   "2006
    Regulations").

 2. The appellants are nationals of  Pakistan  born.  The  first  appellant
    (hereafter "AB") was  born  on  1  April  1989.  The  second  appellant
    (hereafter "SB") was born on 7 December 1953. SB has another  daughter,
    Ms Farhina Adnan (hereafter "FA") who is also a national  of  Pakistan.
    FA married Mr Adnan Latif Bhatti (hereafter the "sponsor"), said to  be
    an EEA national exercising Treaty rights, in June 2014. FA  joined  the
    sponsor in the United Kingdom in January 2015. Up until then,  she  was
    living in Pakistan with the appellants, initially in a  property  owned
    by the second appellant's brother. FA said  in  her  witness  statement
    before the judge that, at around the time  that  she  and  the  sponsor
    agreed to marry, her maternal uncle said that he  needed  his  property
    and "gently" asked FA and the appellants to move out. The sponsor  then
    rented alternative property for them.  He  also  provided  FA  and  the
    appellants  with  financial  support.   The  judge  had   evidence   of
    remittances  from  March  2015  onwards  by  FA/the  sponsor   to   the
    appellants. It was claimed in  evidence  before  the  judge  that  SB's
    husband, who is AB's and FA's father, left  them  many  years  ago  and
    that, prior to financial support being provided by the sponsor, FA used
    to support herself and the appellants in Pakistan. She used to work  as
    a teacher. AB does not work.

 3. The appellants made more than one application for EEA family permits as
    dependent members of the household of an EEA national exercising Treaty
    rights. The applications were refused. The instant appeals concern  the
    decisions dated 22 November 2016 (not 7 September 2016, as  incorrectly
    stated at para 1 of the judge's decision).

The judge's decision

 4. The judge found that the appellants had not established that they  were
    dependent on FA/ the sponsor. Her reasons are given at paras  11-16  of
    her decision. Before I quote paras 11-16, I should  say,  in  order  to
    avoid any confusion, that she used the term "sponsor" to  refer  to  FA
    whereas I have used this term to refer to the EEA national whose status
    in the United Kingdom was relied upon as the basis of the  applications
    for EEA family permits. Paras 11-16 of the judge's decision's  read  as
    follows:


        "11. I note that there is no longer an issue as to  the  nature  of
             the relationships between the appellants and the  sponsor  and
             her husband. However I find that  the  appellants  have  still
             failed to show on the balance of probabilities that  they  are
             dependent on the sponsor and her husband.


        12.  I have seen money transfer paid to the second appellant  since
             she came to the UK in the sum of around ï¿½200 per month. I have
             seen evidence that the appellants live in rented accommodation
             and that the second  appellant  pays  the  rent.  I  have  not
             however seen any evidence of how much their rent is, how  much
             money they need to cover their monthly  expenses,  other  than
             what the second appellant sets out in her witness statement. I
             have seen no independent evidence as to the rental cost or the
             utility bills, which I would have expected to have put  before
             me. Looking at the second appellant's figures, this  does  not
             appear to take into account clothing or any  other  unexpected
             expenses.


        13.  I do not find on what I have seen that the money sent from the
             UK is their only source of income. I am concerned  on  what  I
             have seen as to the credibility of the account given, that the
             second appellant does not work and  that  her  husband  is  no
             longer part of the family and therefore offers no  support.  I
             note that the sponsor completed her visa application  in  2013
             stating that both of her parents work. She did not state  that
             her mother had never worked, nor that her father had not  been
             part of the family since around 2007/2008. She has stated that
             this information was not  correct  and  stated  that  she  was
             advised to mislead the immigration authorities.  I  find  that
             this affects her credibility: she was either lying in 2013  or
             she is lying for the purposes of this application.


        14.  I am also concerned as to truth of the account given that  her
             father plays no part in their lives.  I  have  seen  2  family
             registration certificates, one dated 15th April 2016  and  one
             dated 25th July 2016. The account given by the sponsor and the
             second appellant is that the sponsor's father left  in  around
             2007 and has cut off all ties. This leaves the question as  to
             why the certificate in April 2016 does not show her father, as
             I would expect if he had left, but the certificate dated  only
             3 months later and shortly before this application, shows  her
             father as part of the  family,  suggesting  that  the  account
             relied on is not reliable.  If  it  were  the  case  that  the
             father's photograph remained on the certificate simply because
             there had been no divorce, which would be arguably  plausible,
             it does not explain how only 3 months earlier, his picture had
             been removed. I find that this document, taken  alongside  the
             sponsor's  dishonest  visa  application  causes  me  to   have
             concerns over the credibility  of  this  application.  I  have
             indeed seen  letters  from  Mushtaq  Chaudhery,  Advocate  and
             Naseer Usman, but I do not find that these  letters  take  the
             appellant's case much  further,  as  these  are  self  serving
             documents, based on what  the  authors  have  been  told.  The
             contents do not  suggest  that  they  have  seen  evidence  to
             substantiate what they have written. Furthermore these letters
             do not sit comfortably with  the  recent  family  registration
             certificate as set out earlier.


        15.  The  sponsor  states  that  her  maternal  uncle,  the  second
             appellant's brother, paid for her  studies  and  provided  the
             appellants with accommodation for a period  of  time.  I  have
             seen no evidence from him in this regard. Moreover I have seen
             no evidence as to whether or not  he  had  provided  financial
             support to his sister and other  niece,  which  I  would  have
             expected if he had funded the other niece's education.  It  is
             unclear why the accommodation he offered was withdrawn.


        16.  Taking all of the evidence before me into account, I find that
             the appellants have failed to show that they are dependant  on
             the sponsor and her husband. Whilst I have seen  some  regular
             money transfers, these alone are insufficient to show that the
             appellants have no other source of income  and  are  dependant
             upon  the  sponsor  and  her  husband.  These   appeals   fail
             accordingly."

The grounds

 5. The grounds may be summarised as follows:

     (i) procedural unfairness: the judge had acted unfairly in  failing  to
         give FA and the sponsor an opportunity to respond to certain issues
         relied upon by the judge in her decision. An example  is  given  at
         para 12 of the grounds, i.e. that, if the judge  had  asked  FA  to
         explain the Family Registration Certificates, she would  have  said
         that  such  certificates  are  normally  only  used  to   prove   a
         relationship; they are not evidence  as  to  whether  parties  live
         together or are separated.

     (ii)     the judge failed to take into account the respondent's  policy
         which, it is contended, makes it clear that  the  reasons  for  the
         claimed dependency  are  irrelevant  and  the  question  is  simply
         whether the applicant was in fact dependent on the EEA sponsor.

     (iii)     In  any  event,  the  judge  ignored  relevant  evidence.  In
         summary, the following:

         a)   "Evidence" in the form of representations by  the  appellants'
             representatives in their letter dated 10 August  2016  to  the
             British High Commission (BHC) in Islamabad, at pages 94-95  of
             the  bundle.  The  letter  explained,  inter  alia,  that  the
             appellants do not have a formal tenancy agreement  as  tenancy
             agreements are unusual in Pakistan; that there was no evidence
             of the appellants' dependency on FA before  she  came  to  the
             United Kingdom because FA and the appellants lived in the same
             household;  that  evidence  of  remittances  from  March  2015
             onwards to date had been provided; that  a  breakdown  of  the
             appellants' expenses, which totalled Rs 26,000 per month,  was
             given; and it was said that the remittances, which  were  ï¿½200
             per month equating to Rs 30,000 per month, were sufficient  to
             cover the appellants' expenses.

         b)   Two letters from Mr Naseer Usman who  is  a  Union  Counsellor
             for the area and who  knows  the  family  personally.  He  had
             confirmed that the second appellant  was  separated  from  her
             husband.

         c)   A letter from Mr Mushtaq Chaudhery, an Advocate  of  the  High
             Court,  who  also  confirmed  that  the   second   appellant's
             relationship with her husband had broken down.

         d)   In stating that there was "no  evidence"  from  FA's  maternal
             uncle, the judge overlooked  the  written  evidence  from  the
             appellants and FA about  their  circumstances  prior  to  FA's
             arrival in the United Kingdom and, further, the  judge  failed
             to appreciate that the respondent had not raised any issue  in
             relation to the maternal uncle in the decision notice.

         e)   In stating that "it was unclear why  the  accommodation  [from
             the uncle] was withdrawn", the judge overlooked FA's  evidence
             in her statement where she explained that her uncle needed his
             property and "gently" asked FA and her family to move out.

         f)   The judge failed to take into account and give due  weight  to
             the factual background as set out in FA's  statement  and  the
             detailed representations by the appellants' representatives at
             pages 89-98 of the bundle.

     (iv)     The judge was wrong to  reject  the  letters  from  the  Union
         Counsellor on the basis that they were self-serving, having  regard
         to para 14 of the decision of the Immigration  Appeal  Tribunal  in
         Cledias Moyo [2002] UKIAT 001104.

Assessment

 6. At the hearing before me, Mr Nasim took me through the history  of  the
    previous applications for EEA family permits and explained  that,  upon
    each  refusal,  the  appellants  produced  evidence  to   address   the
    issues/concerns raised by the Entry Clearance Officer in  the  relevant
    decision notice. He submitted that the judge had failed  to  take  this
    history, reasons for the previous refusals and evidence produced by the
    appellants to  respond  to  the  previous  refusals  into  account  and
    stressed that the respondent had not raised,  in  the  decision  notice
    that was the subject of the appeal,  any  concern  about  the  lack  of
    evidence from the second appellant's brother.

 7. I have to say that I do not consider it helpful to be taken through the
    history of the applications and reasons for previous decisions  in  any
    detail. The fact  is  that  the  appellants  have  to  establish,  with
    specific and detailed evidence as opposed to relying on the history  of
    their applications and refusals, that they meet the  dependency  issue.
    Once the respondent had raised the issue that the  appellants  had  not
    established that they were dependent on the sponsor, it was for them to
    establish that they were dependent, to the standard of the  balance  of
    probabilities. There was no need for the judge to refer to the  history
    of applications and refusals. The judge  was  entitled  to  assess  the
    evidence before her and take into account the lack of evidence from the
    second appellant's brother,  if  such  evidence  was  relevant  to  her
    assessment of the dependency issue. It is reasonably obvious that  they
    would have to establish, by way of evidence  or  explanations  for  any
    lack of evidence, the amount of support that they were  receiving  from
    the sponsor and the  amount  of  their  outgoings.  It  was  reasonably
    obvious that they would have to establish their outgoings by  providing
    supporting evidence.

 8. The position might be otherwise in relation to the Family  Registration
    Certificates if (which was not  readily  apparent  to  me)  the  second
    certificate was obtained in order to address a specific point raised by
    the Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) in a refusal decision.  If  this  was
    the case, this  aspect  of  the  history  may  have  been  relevant  in
    addressing the reason for any inconsistency on  the  face  of  the  two
    certificates.  The two certificates also raise another  question,  i.e.
    how it was possible for the second certificate to bear  the  photograph
    of a man in his advanced years if the relationship between SB's husband
    and SB broke down 9 years ago leading to his  departure  for  his  home
    village and if SB and her daughters have not had any contact  with  him
    since (para 2 of SB's witness statement). Although the  judge  did  not
    rely upon this point, the appellants would be well advised  to  address
    it at the next hearing.

 9. As I said at the hearing,  the  representations  from  the  appellants'
    representatives in their letter dated 10 August 2016 at pages 94-95  of
    the appellants' bundle  is  not  evidence;  they  are  representations.
    However, Mr Nasim took me through  the  witness  statements  and  other
    evidence  in  the  bundle  from  which  I   am   satisfied   that   the
    representations that he relied upon before me concerning,  inter  alia,
    the breakdown of the appellants' expenses, that the  sponsor  had  made
    remittances for the support of the appellants from March 2015  and  the
    history of past dependency on  FA  when  FA  lived  in  Pakistan,  were
    evidenced in the bundle before the judge.

10. Ms Holmes submitted, inter alia, that it  is  clear  from  the  judge's
    reasoning, that she simply did not find FA credible, given that FA  had
    said in her visa application of 2013 that both of her  parents  worked.
    She submitted that the judge was entitled to find  that  this  affected
    her credibility because she was either lying in 2013 or she  was  lying
    for the purposes of the applications  that  were  the  subject  of  the
    appeals. She submitted that the judge was  entitled  to  conclude  that
    this fact, when taken together with the  issues  raised  by  the  judge
    concerning the Family Registration Certificates, materially  undermined
    the credibility of the appellants'  case  that  the  sponsor  had  been
    making remittances to them for their financial support.

11. There is no substance in the submission that the judge erred in law  by
    failing to take into account the respondent's policy to the effect that
    the reasons for the claimed dependency are irrelevant, given  that  the
    judge did not say that she found the  reasons  given  for  the  claimed
    dependency to be incredible.  It is plain,  from  her  reasoning  as  a
    whole, that she was considering whether the appellants had  established
    their claimed dependency as a fact as opposed to the reasons for  their
    claimed dependency.

12. In my judgment, the  judge  was  right  to  have  concerns  as  to  the
    credibility of the evidence that the second appellant's husband was  no
    longer part of the appellants' and FA's family. In  my  view,  she  was
    also entitled to take into account the issue she raised concerning  the
    Family Registration certificates. The fact that the father was included
    in a second certificate three months after the  first  certificate  had
    been issued legitimately  raised  the  concern  she  raised  which  was
    reasonably  within  the  contemplation  of  the  appellants  and  their
    solicitors for them to have addressed without the judge having to raise
    the matter at the hearing, given that it was not apparent  to  me  that
    the second certificate was obtained in  order  to  address  a  specific
    point in a refusal decision.

13.  Nonetheless,  having  carefully  considered  the  submissions  of  the
    parties, I have concluded that the judge did materially err in  law  as
    follows:

14. Firstly, the sponsor and FA both attended the hearing to give evidence.
    There was no Presenting Officer.  The  judge  heard  evidence  from  FA
    whilst the sponsor remained outside the hearing room.  The  judge  then
    said that she did not need to hear evidence  from  the  sponsor.  Given
    that the case was that financial support  was  being  provided  by  the
    sponsor to the appellants, the judge's decision not  to  hear  evidence
    from the sponsor whilst concluding that the evidence of  FA  concerning
    the financial support that the sponsor was providing to the  appellants
    was not credible was procedurally unfair. In  effect,  the  judge  took
    issue with the  credibility  of  the  evidence  that  the  sponsor  was
    providing financial support but took a positive step to say she did not
    need to hear from him, thus denying him the opportunity  of  persuading
    her, through his oral evidence,  that  he  had  genuinely  been  making
    remittances to the appellants for their financial support.

15. The appellants were therefore deprived of a  fair  hearing  before  the
    judge. This is sufficient, in itself, for the judge's  decision  to  be
    set aside and the appeals remitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a
    fresh decision on the appeals, whatever may be said about the remaining
    grounds.

16. Secondly, it was not sufficient, in the particular circumstances of the
    case, for the judge to say that either FA was lying when she  made  her
    2013 visa application or she was lying now, given  that  FA's  evidence
    was to the effect that she had lied in her 2013  visa  application  for
    the reasons she explained, i.e. that she was  advised  to  mislead  the
    immigration authorities. It was  necessary  of  the  judge  to  make  a
    specific finding on this evidence. If it was the case that FA had  lied
    in her 2013 visa application, it must follow, from  the  judge's  logic
    (that she was either lying in her 2013 visa application or lying  now),
    that she was now telling the truth. Her evidence would then  materially
    support the appellants' case that they were  financially  dependent  on
    the sponsor.

17. Accordingly, by failing to make a clear finding as to  whether  FA  had
    lied in her 2013 visa application or was lying now, the judge failed to
    resolve a question of fact that was material to her own reasoning. This
    difficulty in the judge's  decision  would  not  have  arisen  if,  for
    example, she had said that she was satisfied that FA was lying on  both
    occasions.

18. Thirdly, in her assessment of the letters from  Mushtaq  Chaudhery  and
    Naseer Usman, the judge  said  that  the  letters  were  "self  serving
    documents, based on what the authors have been told.  The  contents  do
    not suggest that they have seen evidence to substantiate what they have
    written. Furthermore these letters do  not  sit  comfortably  with  the
    recent family registration certificate as set out earlier." However, it
    was not  correct to say that the letter from Mr Usman was based on what
    he had been told, given that Mr Usman said in his letter that he  knows
    the appellants very well. Apart from this sentence in his letter, there
    was nothing in the letter which indicates one way or the other  whether
    he had based the contents of his letters on  what  he  had  been.   The
    sentence in which he states that he  knows  the  appellants  very  well
    suggests, on the other hand, that he based the contents of his  letters
    on his own personal knowledge of the appellants and the  FA  and  their
    past and present circumstances.

19. The issues I have raised at paras  16-18  above  are  sufficient,  when
    taken together, to materially undermine the judge's reasoning.

20. For the reasons given at paras 14-15 above  and,  in  the  alternative,
    paras 16-18 above, there were material errors of  law  in  the  judge's
    decision. I set aside her  decision  in  its  entirety  save  that  her
    summary of the evidence she heard, at paras 6 and 7  of  her  decision,
    stand as a summary of the evidence she heard and may be relied upon  by
    either party at the next hearing.

21. In the majority of cases, the Upper Tribunal  when  setting  aside  the
    decision will re-make the relevant decision itself.  However, para  7.2
    of the Practice Statements for the Immigration and Asylum  Chambers  of
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  the  Upper  Tribunal   (the   "Practice
    Statements") recognises that it may  not  be  possible  for  the  Upper
    Tribunal to proceed to re-make the decision when it is satisfied that:

         "(a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the
             First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for
             that party's case to be put to and considered by the First-
             tier Tribunal; or

         (b)  the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which is
             necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-
             made is such that, having regard to the overriding objective
             in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case to the First-
             tier Tribunal."

22. In my judgment this case falls within para  7.2  (a)  for  the  reasons
    given at paras 14-15 above. I therefore  remit  these  appeals  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal  for  a  fresh  decision  on  the  merits  on  each
    appellant's appeal by a  judge  other  than  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Nixon.

23. As I said at the hearing, I had difficulty finding the decision notices
    dated 22 November 2016. In the event, the copy that was located related
    to the second appellant only. I was unable to  locate  a  copy  of  the
    decision  notice  dated  22  November  2016  addressed  to  the   first
    appellant.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  errors  on
points of law sufficient for it to be set aside. The  appeals  are  remitted
to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing on  the  merits  by  a  judge
other than Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Nixon.

     Directions to the parties

(1)  The decisions on the  appellants'  appeals  await  determination  by  a
      Judge of the First-tier Tribunal other than Judge Nixon.

(2)  No later than 5 calendar days  of  this  decision  being  sent  to  the
      appellants' UK representatives, the first appellant to file and  serve
      a copy of the decision notice dated 22 November 2016 addressed to her.



(3)  An interpreter in the Urdu language will  be  made  available  for  the
      hearing. If an interpreter in another language  is  required  instead,
      the appellants to notify the First-tier  Tribunal  within  5  calendar
      days of this decision being sent to their UK representatives:

     (a) the language in which an interpreter is required; and

     (b) the number of witnesses who will give evidence.

(3)  The Tribunal's file contains a copy of the appellants' bundle that  was
      submitted under cover of a  letter  dated  28  November  2017  and  an
      identical  bundle submitted under cover of a letter dated  17  October
      2018. If the appellants wish to rely upon any additional evidence, any
      such evidence must be served within 21 days of the date on which  this
      "Decision and Directions" is sent to the parties.
