                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Respondents

 1. The Respondents to whom I shall refer as the Applicants are citizens of
    India born respectively in 1930 and 1931.  They are  husband  and  wife
    and are the parents of the Sponsor who  is  their  son  and  a  British
    citizen.  He works as a fund manager The first Applicant  suffers  from
    Parkinson's disease and the second Applicant is  his  wife  who  is  no
    longer able to cope with his care as his condition deteriorates.

 2. The Sponsor is married and his wife works in the banking sector.   They
    have two children aged at the date of the decision about 18  and  about
    14.

 3. On 4 October 2013  the  Applicants  sought  entry  clearance  as  adult
    dependent relatives of their son, the Sponsor.

The Decision and Appeal

 4. On 5  December 2013 the Appellant (the  ECO)  under  reference  numbers
    3490127 and 3490128 refused the application of each of the  Applicants.
    He noted the husband had been suffering from  Parkinson's  disease  for
    the previous five years and had last been discharged from  hospital  in
    July 2013.  He noted the husband was unable to care for  himself  on  a
    daily basis and that he had received regular financial support from his
    son the Sponsor over the previous three years.  He also noted that  his
    wife, the second Applicant was not physically  able  to  care  for  her
    husband.  He referred to the fact the Applicants had a daughter who was
    settled in the United States with a family; that they had travelled  to
    the United Kingdom in the previous four years and  had  also  travelled
    once in the previous four years to the United States.  He  referred  to
    hospital facilities in New Delhi as comparable to those in  the  United
    Kingdom.  He also referred to the Applicants' culture which placed  the
    responsibility for their care on their son.

 5. The husband's application was refused under  para.EC-DR.1.1(d)  and  E-
    ECDR.2.5 of Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules.

 6. The ECO noted the wife was in remission from cancer of  the  colon  and
    was unable to care for herself.  He noted the husband's application had
    been refused and refused her application under paras.EC-DR.1.1(d) and E-
    ECDR.2.4 of Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules.

 7. Para.EC-DR.1.1 states that for entry clearance as  an  adult  dependent
    relative the Applicant must, in addition to other matters and  none  of
    which were raised by the ECO, meet all the requirements of  Section  E-
    ECDR.  Para.E-ECDR.2.4 states that:-

         The applicant or, if  the  applicant  and  their  partner  are  the
         sponsor's parents ... the applicant's partner, must as a result  of
         age, illness or  disability  require  long-term  personal  care  to
         perform everyday tasks.

    and para.E-ECDR.2.5 states:-

         The applicant or, if  the  applicant  and  their  partner  are  the
         sponsor's parents ... the applicant's partner, must be unable, even
         with the practical and financial help of the sponsor, to obtain the
         required level of care  in  the  country  where  they  are  living,
         because-


         (a)  it is not available and there is no person in that country who
             can reasonably provide it; or;


         (b)  it is not affordable.

 8. On 28 December 2013 each of the  Applicants  lodged  notice  of  appeal
    under Section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as
    amended (the 2002 Act).  The grounds refer to  additional  difficulties
    in providing care for the husband on  account  of  his  hallucinations,
    depression and feelings of insecurity brought about by the  effects  of
    both the husband's condition and his medication.  Mention was  made  to
    the fact the Sponsor had visited India three times in the previous  six
    months at short notice.

 9. The Sponsor's two children are well-established. At around the time the
    decisions under appeal were made the Sponsor's eldest child had started
    university studies and his younger  child  had  started  grade  9.   In
    addition both he and his wife worked full-time in the  United  Kingdom.
    The wife's grounds of appeal were linked to those of her husband.

The First-tier Tribunal's Determination

10. By a determination promulgated on 28 November 2014 Judge of the  First-
    tier Tribunal L K Gibbs  allowed  the  appeals  under  the  Immigration
    Rules,  noting  the  Respondent  had  not  challenged   the   Sponsor's
    documentary and oral evidence.

11. The ECO sought permission to appeal on the sole ground in the  case  of
    each of the Applicants that the Judge had failed to consider the appeal
    of the wife, the second Applicant.

12. On 20 January 2015 Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Pirotta  granted
    permission to appeal on the basis that the Judge  had  "carried  out  a
    superficial analysis of the evidence concerning the  first  Appellant's
    case and ... failed to make any mention of the grounds or  evidence  in
    the appeal concerning the second Appellant"  and  that  the  permission
    application "properly raises concerns that  the  IJ  had  not  properly
    taken the law into account and was in error in not providing a reasoned
    decision on the case of the second  Appellant".   Further  the  Judge's
    decision  "discloses  several  arguable   material   errors   of   law,
    misconstruction  of  the  law  and  scant  reference  to  the  relevant
    evidence".

The Error of Law Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

13. The Sponsor was present to represent the Applicants.  Mr Tarlow for the
    Respondent properly accepted that even if the grounds for permission to
    appeal relating to the second Applicant were correct it would  make  no
    difference to the outcome  in  relation  to  the  first  Applicant  and
    applied for permission to amend the grounds for appeal  in  respect  of
    the  first  Applicant.  I  referred  to  the  overriding  objective  in
    Procedure Rule 2 and noted that effectively at such a  late  stage  the
    application to amend or plead new grounds amounted to  an  ambush.   Mr
    Tarlow then sought to put the  application  on  more  limited  grounds,
    namely a variation of the grounds for appeal to reflect the findings of
    Judge Pirotta in paragraphs 3 and 4  of  her  grant  of  permission  to
    appeal to the substance of which reference has already been  made.   In
    the circumstances I did not see the Sponsor could reasonably  claim  he
    or the Applicants had been caught unawares.

14. Mr Tarlow referred to paragraph 13 of the Judge's  decision  which  set
    out para.E-ECDR.2.5 and  submitted  that  the  following  paragraph  14
    failed to give sufficient reasons to show why the Judge had  found  the
    Applicants met  the  relevant  requirements.  The  failure  to  provide
    adequate reasoning amounted to a material error of law.  I referred  to
    paragraphs 10-12 of the decision in which the Judge had set out in some
    detail the evidence of the Sponsor about the situation of  his  parents
    in India and of his family in the United Kingdom. The  Judge  had  made
    positive credibility findings at paragraphs 10 and 14.  Mr Tarlow  then
    sought simply to rely on the grounds  for  appeal  amended  as  he  had
    requested for the ECO.

15. At various points during Mr Tarlow's submissions I  had  explained  the
    position to the Sponsor who had nothing to add.

16. I considered the submissions for the ECO and found the original grounds
    for appeal did disclose an arguable error  in  law  but  they  did  not
    disclose a material error of law such that the Judge's decision  should
    be set  aside  for  the  reason  already  given  and  accepted  by  the
    Respondent. I considered the ECO's new grounds, effectively as set  out
    paras.3-4 of the grant of permission to appeal  disclosed  an  arguable
    error of law and concluded that paras.10-12  of  the  Judge's  decision
    gave adequate reasons to justify the  conclusions  she  reached  by  at
    paras.14-15 of her determination.

17. The Judge carefully considered the documentary evidence  and  the  oral
    testimony of the Sponsor which  she  had  set  out  in  paras.9-12.   A
    careful reading of these paragraphs showed that the  Sponsor's  parents
    had unfortunately reached  a  stage  where  they  were  in  need  of  a
    considerable degree of care and help throughout the day and  that  even
    if the Sponsor and his wife were working full-time their involvement on
    a day-to-day basis and their immediate availability  since  they  lived
    and worked in London could not be replicated relying on local resources
    in India.  That the first Appellant succeeded  meant  that  the  second
    Appellant, his wife, also had to succeed under the  Immigration  Rules.
    Consequently, I concluded that the  new  grounds  did  not  disclose  a
    material error of law such that the  Judge's  decision  should  be  set
    aside.

Anonymity

18. There was no request for an anonymity direction and  having  considered
    the matter I find that none is warranted.



Notice of Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  contain  a  material
    error of law such that it should be set aside and  therefore  it  shall
    stand.  The consequence is that:


    The ECO's appeal in respect of each of the Applicants is dismissed.


    The appeal of each of the Applicants is allowed.
