Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms A Jones, counsel (instructed by Dhogal Partners
Solicitors)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. For the sake of convenience, I shall refer to  the  appellant  as  the
      Secretary of State, and the respondent as "the claimant."


   2. The claimant appealed against a decision of the respondent  dated  1st
      May 2013 to refuse to vary his leave to remain in the UK as a  Tier  1
      (Entrepreneur) Migrant. The Secretary of State was not satisfied  that
      the claimant had demonstrated  that  he  had  access  to  �200,000  as
      required by Appendix A.


   3. In a decision promulgated on 28th April 2014, the First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge allowed the appeal. The  Secretary  of  State  had  awarded  the
      claimant no points for attributes: Appendix  A.  He  supplied  a  bank
      letter from Habibi Bank  Ltd  -  HBL-  together  with  a  third  party
      declaration showing that he had access to more than �200,000.


   4. However, the letter from HBL did not state his name on it  or  confirm
      the amount of money available to him as required by the Tier 1  policy
      guidance.


   5. Before the First-tier Tribunal Judge, the claimant asserted that while
      the letter that he submitted to HBL did not have his name on  it,  the
      secretary of state should have sought that information from him  prior
      to  making  the  decision.  That  information  would  then  have  been
      forthcoming.


   6. The Judge however stated that the only matter of concern was that  the
      claimant's name did not appear on the HBL letter.


   7. The Judge had regard to paragraph 245AA (d). That provides that if the
      applicant has submitted a specified document which  does  not  contain
      all  the  specified  information,  but  the  missing  information   is
      verifiable from other documents submitted with  the  application,  the
      application may be  granted  exceptionally  provided  that  the  Entry
      Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary  of  State  is
      satisfied that the specified documents are genuine and  the  applicant
      meets all the other requirements.  The Secretary of State reserves the
      right to request the specified original documents.


   8. The Judge found that the nature of the  omission  was  one  that  came
      within paragraph  245AA(b)(iv),  namely  that  the  document  did  not
      contain all the specified information.  The  Judge  characterised  the
      "complaint" that owing to the omission of the claimant's name  on  the
      HBL letter, it cannot be established on the balance  of  probabilities
      that the funds are available to the claimant [11] and [16].


   9. The Judge found that none of the material submitted  by  the  claimant
      was anything  other  than  genuine.  All  the  other  requirements  of
      paragraph 41-SD(d) were met. The  documents  addressed  the  issue  of
      availability of those funds to the claimant.


  10. Accordingly, the Judge was satisfied that there was "an  abundance  of
      other material" from which the Secretary  of  State  could  have  been
      satisfied  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that  the  funds  were
      available to the claimant. That was the only  issue  "extant"  and  he
      found that the claimant met that requirement and that the  application
      should have been allowed "within the parameters of paragraph 245AA (d)
      of the Rules". Accordingly, the claimant should have been  awarded  75
      points pursuant to Appendix A.


  11. The Secretary of State sought to appeal against that decision  on  the
      basis that the rules require that third party support  documents  from
      the bank must both contain the information regarding the  claimant  as
      well as confirming the availability of the money to  him.   These  had
      not been met. Evidential flexibility would not apply to this  case  as
      the bank had not set out that the money was available to the claimant.
      The missing information was thus confirmation from the bank  that  the
      money is available to the claimant.


  12. On  29th  May  2014,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Foudi  granted  the
      Secretary of State permission to appeal on the  basis  that  the  only
      matter of concern raised by the Judge had  been  the  absence  of  the
      claimant's name on the letter, whereas the bank had not confirmed that
      the funds were available to the claimant. The Judge had not dealt with
      that issue at all in the determination.


  13. At the hearing on 21st July 2014, Mr Duffy relied on  the  grounds  of
      appeal. He submitted that the Judge wrongly found that the application
      could be granted exceptionally pursuant to paragraph 245AA. The  whole
      point is that the bank must confirm that the sponsor intends  to  make
      the money available to the  claimant.  In  this  case,  it  cannot  be
      gleaned from other documents.


  14. He accepted, however, that in the circumstances the Secretary of State
      should have contacted the claimant in writing to request  the  correct
      documents as the  bank  letter  did  not  contain  all  the  specified
      information. To that extent, the decision had not been  in  accordance
      with the law, and the appeal should have been upheld on that basis.


  15. On behalf of the claimant, Ms Jones submitted that the  error  of  law
      has to be material. If it would not make a difference to the  outcome,
      it would not be material.


  16. In any event she contended that the Judge had in fact made  no  error.
      She  referred  to  three  documents  which   provided   the   relevant
      information required by the rules which could be "gleaned"  from  this
      documentation: Those documents are contained at pages 38, 39 and 40 of
      the appellant's bundle.


  17. The letter from the bank dated 3rd December  2012  confirms  that  Mrs
      Noshaba Mudassar (the third party sponsor) is a customer of the  bank,
      maintaining an account, the numbers of which have been identified.  In
      addition, the relevant balance at that date is also set out.


  18. The letter goes on to state  that  the  amount  is  available  to  Mrs
      Noshaba Mudassar and is freely transferable in the UK and  convertible
      into pounds sterling.  Whilst it did not in terms state that the money
      is available to the appellant  in  that  letter,  she  submitted  that
      regard  must  also  be  had  to  the  additional  documentation  which
      accompanied the application and which provided the necessary link.


  19. In particular, she had regard to a letter from Mrs Noshaba Mudassar in
      which her name, address and passport number  are  set  out.   In  that
      letter, she expressly  refers  to  the  application  of  the  claimant
      including his address and date of  birth,  and  passport  number.  She
      notes that he has made an application for  entrepreneurial  status  in
      the UK.


  20. She further states that she is a family friend of the claimant. She is
      willing to share this information with the UKBA.  She states that  she
      has �200,000 which she will make available  to  the  claimant  or  the
      business "they run" in the UK. He has full access to use  and  dispose
      of the said amount of money freely in the UK.


  21. Ms Jones also referred to page 40, containing the full details of  the
      third party  sponsor,  namely  Mrs  Noshaba  Mudassar,  including  her
      address and passport/ID numbers.


  22. The document confirms that she is the third party  in  the  claimant's
      application and that she has signed an enclosed letter making funds of
      �200,000 available to the claimant.  There is also confirmation  by  a
      notary public that the letter signed by Mrs Mudassar as  third  party,
      is "authentic and valid."


  23. Ms Jones referred to the evidence produced regarding the third party's
      bank account at  page  37,  held  with  HBL.  The  account  number  is
      identified as well  as  the  third  party's  name  and  address  which
      corresponds to the name and address  contained  in  the  documents  at
      pages 38, 39 and 40. The  account  number  on  page  37,  the  current
      account, corresponds with the bank letter, the third  party  statement
      and the details contained in the letter from the notary public.


  24. Accordingly, even though the Judge did not  deal  in  terms  with  the
      issue raised by the secretary of state, namely, that the bank had  not
      confirmed that the funds were available to the appellant, that did not
      constitute a material error as the missing information  is  verifiable
      from the other documents submitted with the application.


     Assessment


  25. The issue raised by the secretary of state  is  that  the  information
      missing is the confirmation from the bank that the money is  available
      to the claimant. It is contended that the Judge failed to set out  the
      evidence allowing him to conclude that the information  was  contained
      in the other evidence.


  26. It is contended that the Judge failed to give any reasons or at  least
      adequate reasons where the information lies in the other evidence that
      shows that the bank acknowledges that the money is  available  to  the
      claimant and that accordingly there is a mandatory piece  of  evidence
      missing.


  27. Mr Duffy on behalf of the Secretary of State stated at the outset that
      the decision of the secretary of state was not in accordance with  the
      law as the  missing  information  should  have  been  requested  under
      paragraph 245AA of the rules. The  claimant  should  have  been  given
      seven working days from the date of the request to provide the correct
      documents. Accordingly, the appeal should have been allowed albeit  on
      a different basis.


  28. I have had regard to Ms Jones' submission that the application in  any
      event could have been granted exceptionally under that paragraph. That
      is upon the  basis  that  this  claimant  has  submitted  a  specified
      document which does not contain all the specified information, but the
      missing information is verifiable from other documents submitted  with
      the application.


  29. I have set out the specified information which was  missing  from  the
      bank statement.  I find that the information was in the  circumstances
      verifiable from other documents submitted with the application.


  30. I have had regard to the statement from the HBL at page  38  in  which
      the bank states that the relevant amount is available to Mrs Mudassar,
      and which is also freely transferable in the UK. The account number as
      well as the amount contained in her HBL account at Gulberg Main Market
      Branch is identified not only in the letter but  also  in  the  actual
      bank statement produced and which relates to  Mrs  Mudassar;  this  is
      moreover signed by the Habib Bank Ltd, Gulberg Main Market Branch.


  31. In addition, there is the third party letter from Mrs Mudassar herself
      in which her details relating to her identity and address are set  out
      and which correspond with all the other documents;  the letter  states
      that the money concerned is available to the claimant,  whose  address
      is set out. That has been signed in front  of  a  notary  public.  The
      third party statement also refers to the  enclosed  letter  which  Mrs
      Mudassar has signed as a third party in the claimant's application for
      entrepreneurial status in the UK.


  32. I am accordingly satisfied that although there was an  error  made  by
      the Judge in omitting to deal with the secretary of state's contention
      that there was missing information constituting confirmation from  the
      bank that the money would be available to the claimant, this turns out
      not to have been material as  the  other  documents  produced  clearly
      demonstrate that the missing information  from  the  bank  letter  was
      verifiable from  those  other  documents  submitted  as  part  of  the
      application.


     Decision


     The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  did  not  involve  the
making of a   material error on a point of law. It shall accordingly  stand.
