                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This appeal comes before me  following  the  grant  of  permission  to
      appeal on 12 September 2017.

   2. The appellant is a national of Taiwan, born on  9  April  1966.  On  8
      December 2001, in Taiwan, she married [SM], a British citizen who  had
      been residing in Taiwan since 1998. They had a daughter, [M], born  on
      13 February 2002, a British citizen. Following  the  death  of  [SM]'s
      mother in the UK the family decided to  move  to  the  UK  and  on  12
      February 2016 the appellant applied for entry clearance to the UK as a
      spouse under Appendix FM of the immigration rules. Her application was
      considered under paragraph EC-P.1.1 of Appendix FM.

   3. The respondent refused the appellant's application on 16 July 2016  on
      the basis that she was not satisfied that the appellant  had  provided
      all the specified evidence required to demonstrate that  she  met  the
      financial requirements as set out in Appendix FM-SE paragraphs  3  and
      4. The respondent considered that the appellant had failed to  provide
      the specified evidence with respect to her employment outside the  UK,
      namely a letter from her current employer in Taiwan, and had failed to
      provide the required evidence as to the offer of employment in the  UK
      for the sponsor. It  was  noted  that  the  email  produced  from  the
      relevant employer cwkproperties did not confirm that the sponsor would
      start work within 3 months of his return to the  UK,  as  required  in
      paragraph  E-ECP.3.2(a)  and  E-ECC.2.2(a)   of   Appendix   FM.   The
      application was therefore refused under paragraph EC-P.1.1(d)  as  the
      appellant  failed  to  meet  the  requirements   of   E-ECP.3.1.   The
      appellant's application was also refused under  the  English  language
      requirement as she was not exempt from the requirement under paragraph
      E-ECP.4.2 and the respondent was not satisfied that the  reason  given
      by the appellant for not meeting the requirement,  namely  the  sudden
      passing of her spouse's mother, was sufficient to justify waiving that
      requirement.

   4. The appellant appealed against that decision. In support of her appeal
      her husband, [SM],  provided  some  background  to  the  relationship,
      explaining that their daughter [M] was now fourteen years of age. [SM]
      referred to evidence he was submitting to meet the requirements of the
      immigration rules consisting of a letter from his employer  in  Taiwan
      and a signed contract of employment for employment in the UK  starting
      within three months of return to the UK. [SM] explained that when  his
      wife made enquiries to the UK Visa Service they informed her that  she
      did not need to do the English language test as her husband and  child
      were British and they had a permanent address in the UK where  he  had
      lived previously. They had  decided  to  move  to  the  UK  after  his
      mother's death, to be with his father and other family members. He was
      due to start his employment with  CWK  in  September  2016  and  their
      daughter had been accepted into a school and was also due to start  in
      September 2016. The refusal of entry clearance to his wife would  tear
      apart the family and would be in  breach  of  their  Article  8  human
      rights.

   5. The Entry Clearance Manager undertook a review of the decision  on  23
      August 2016 in light of the grounds  of  appeal,  but  maintained  the
      decision and concluded that it did not breach Article 8.


   6. In the meantime, and before the appeal was  listed  for  hearing,  the
      appellant and her family travelled to the UK and the appellant  sought
      entry as a visitor. As a national of Taiwan she did not require  prior
      entry clearance. However she was refused entry on the  basis  that  it
      was not accepted that she was a genuine visitor owing to her  previous
      unsuccessful application for entry as a spouse. She  was  returned  to
      Taiwan and the sponsor and their daughter remained in the UK.


   7.  The appellant's appeal was considered on the papers  on  18  November
      2016 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Juss. The judge noted  the  evidence
      from  the  sponsor  in  relation  to  his  employment  addressing  the
      requirements  of  the  immigration  rules,  but  considered  that  the
      appellant could not succeed because she  could  not  comply  with  the
      English language requirement of the immigration  rules.  He  dismissed
      the appeal as the requirements of the immigration rules could  not  be
      met.

   8. In seeking permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal the sponsor,  on
      behalf of the appellant, referred to the fact that he and his daughter
      had now been separated from his wife for six months.

   9. Permission to appeal was refused by the First-tier Tribunal, but  then
      granted by the Upper Tribunal on 12 September 2017 on the grounds that
      the judge had arguably erred by focussing solely  on  the  appellant's
      ability to meet the requirements of the immigration rules as a partner
      without considering her family life.

Appeal Hearing


  10. The sponsor, [SM], appeared at the hearing before me without  a  legal
      representative.  His  step-father  and  daughter  [M]  were  also   in
      attendance.

  11. Ms Pal agreed that Judge  Juss  had  erred  by  failing  to  make  any
      findings on Article 8 and that the decision needed to  be  re-made  in
      that respect.


  12. There was then some discussion as to how  and  when  the  decision  on
      Article 8 should be made. Ms Pal,  erring  on  the  side  of  caution,
      suggested that the decision be re-made on  another  day  so  that  the
      sponsor could produce  supporting  evidence  in  an  organised  bundle
      rather than the pile of loose documents he had brought with  him.  She
      said that she was, however, willing to  look  through  the  documents.
      Having done so she was prepared to concede that there was family  life
      between the appellant and the sponsor and  [M]  and  the  only  issue,
      therefore was proportionality. She was prepared to  cross-examine  the
      sponsor and, if necessary, [M], but equally she was  content  for  the
      matter to  be  adjourned  and  considered  another  day  with  a  more
      organised bundle of  documentary  evidence  from  the  sponsor.  [SM],
      however, was keen for the matter to be dealt with immediately, stating
      that he had been waiting so long for the matter  to  be  resolved  and
      that he had had problems getting anyone to consider  the  matter,  and
      furthermore that he had had to travel from Portsmouth and  would  find
      it difficult missing work again to attend a further  hearing  when  he
      believed that he had all the necessary evidence with him.

  13. I decided to proceed  with  the  appeal.  Ms  Pal  cross-examined  the
      sponsor. He said that he had had to apply for his daughter's place  at
      school a year before she could start and when it was time to enrol her
      his wife came with, on a return ticket, intending to settle [M] in and
      then return to Taiwan. They did not think there would be a problem  as
      his wife did not require a visa and had visited the UK  several  times
      previously. However she was denied entry and  sent  straight  back  to
      Taiwan without any of her possessions. His wife had tried to pass  the
      English language test but had failed it. He had all  the  papers  with
      him to prove that. She was able to speak English but  found  the  test
      stressful. She was suffering from anxiety as a result of  the  current
      situation. [SM] said that he last saw his wife in August of this year.
      [M] was having to go to school by herself, as he had to  go  to  work,
      whereas in Taiwan her mother had always taken her. She had  her  GCSEs
      this year. He would rush home to be there by 4pm in time for when  [M]
      got home from school. [M] spoke to her mother every day or every other
      day. [SM] said that he  was  currently  self-employed,  making  roller
      shutters for doors and doing groundworks  and  dealing  with  drainage
      systems. He and [M] were living in a house owned by his father,  where
      his wife would also live when she came here.  His  father  bought  the
      house when he said that he  was  returning  to  the  UK.  He  had  the
      contract for the house with him, as well as the tenancy agreement,  as
      he paid rent to his father, of �500 per month.  His  father  lived  in
      Cornwall in another house that he owned. [SM] said that he returned to
      the UK on 2 August 2016 and stayed with his step-father at first,  but
      then moved into his father's house in May 2017. They had to wait until
      [M] finished school in Taiwan before coming here.

  14. [SM] said that his wife had visited the UK three times, in 2005,  2010
      and 2013. She owned her own property in Taiwan and had �25,000 in  her
      bank account which she had inherited from her father when he  died  in
      2012. She would want to work in the UK, not necessarily for the money,
      but to keep her occupied. Some of his mother's friends had restaurants
      and so she could work there. [SM] said that his earnings  varied,  but
      October had been a good month and he had earned around  �600  a  week,
      although other months he earned �1600. He had had to turn down  a  lot
      of work because of having to get home for 4pm for [M] and could earn a
      lot more if he was able work longer hours. He had worked as an English
      teacher in Taiwan. His wife used to be a Chinese teacher until she had
      [M] and she was currently working in a restaurant.


  15. In response to my questions, [SM] said that he was not able to take up
      the offer of employment with CWK because he had  to  look  after  [M],
      although he was able to prove the required income from that employment
      when his wife made her entry clearance application. [M] had her  GSCEs
      coming up shortly. She  was  not  really  coping  without  her  mother
      although she said she was okay and he was  not  able  to  discuss  the
      women's issues with her for which she needed her mother. I asked  [SM]
      what would happen if his wife could not come here and he replied  that
      he did not know as he did not want to take [M] out of school. Also  he
      did not want to leave his father  or  his  step-father  who  had  been
      married to his mother for 30 years. He was  worried  about  his  step-
      father when his mother died and he wanted to be  here  to  look  after
      him. His mother's death was very unexpected. [SM] said that  his  wife
      had tried to take the English language test once so far. It  was  very
      expensive to keep taking it. He  had  always  conversed  with  [M]  in
      English whilst his wife conversed with her in Mandarin. His wife would
      speak to him in Mandarin whilst he would speak to her in English.  She
      could speak English but she got words mixed up when under pressure, as
      when doing the test.

  16. Ms Pal did not seek to cross-examine [M] and I saw no need myself  for
      her to be questioned, although she was willing to answer questions put
      to her.


  17. Ms Pal then made submissions. She submitted that Judge Juss  had  made
      no clear findings on the financial  requirements  of  the  immigration
      rules and that that was still a matter to be decided. She relied on  a
      recent Court of Appeal judgment on Article  8  entry  clearance  cases
      which considered the weight to be given where  the  immigration  rules
      could not be satisfied. The appellant could not meet the  requirements
      of the immigration  rules  as  the  financial  requirements  were  not
      demonstrated and the appellant  did  not  have  the  English  language
      requirement. There were no sufficiently exceptional  circumstances  to
      justify a grant of entry clearance outside the immigration rules.  The
      appellant could not meet the public interest requirements  in  section
      117B(2) and (3) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.


  18. In response,  [SM]  said  that  it  was  his  understanding  that  the
      financial requirements had changed and that  third-party  support  was
      permitted. His father and  step-father  were  able  to  help  them  if
      further financial support was needed.

Consideration and findings

  19. As agreed by Ms Pal, the decision in the appellant's appeal is  to  be
      re-made with respect to Article 8, Judge Juss having  failed  to  make
      any findings in that regard. I would agree with Ms  Pal,  furthermore,
      that Judge Juss's  findings  on  the  financial  requirements  of  the
      immigration rules were not clear, although it could be said  from  [6]
      and [7] that he was satisfied in that regard but dismissed the  appeal
      owing to the  appellant's  inability  to  meet  the  English  language
      requirements of the rules. In any event I have given consideration  to
      the appellant's ability to meet  the  financial  requirements  of  the
      immigration rules.

  20. However before doing so I have had  regard  to  the  question  of  the
      relevant date for consideration of the appellant's  circumstances.  Ms
      Pal asked me to find that, since this  was  an  Article  8  case,  the
      relevant date was the date of the hearing and she believed  that  that
      was clarified in a recent Court of Appeal judgement. Having considered
      the recent Court of Appeal judgments  in  Article  8  entry  clearance
      cases I am, however, unable to find any  such  clarification.  It  has
      always been  the  case  that  in  entry  clearance  cases,  both  when
      considering the immigration rules and Article 8, the relevant date was
      the date of the decision, as stated in clear terms  in  Gurung  v  The
      Entry Clearance Officer, New Delhi [2016] EWCA Civ 358  at  [17]  with
      reference to section 85A(2) of the 2002 Act. It is of course the case,
      however, that section 85A(2) has since been repealed.


  21. In view of the lack of clarity in this respect, and given  that  I  do
      not consider the different dates would make any material difference in
      this particular case, I have considered the appellant's  circumstances
      at both points in time.


  22. There is a further complication in that it is not entirely clear  what
      documentary evidence was before the entry clearance officer  when  the
      decision was made and what  evidence  was  produced  thereafter.  [SM]
      assured me that the  entry  clearance  officer  had  his  contract  of
      employment showing that his employment in the UK with CWK was  due  to
      commence within three months of his return to the UK.  What  is  clear
      from the respondent's appeal bundle is that, at the  very  least,  the
      entry clearance manager had before him a letter  from  CWK  Electrical
      Limited confirming the sponsor's employment in the  UK  commencing  in
      September 2016, which was within three months of his return to the UK,
      at a salary of �31,200.  The entry clearance manager also had a letter
      from the sponsor's employer in  Taiwan  confirming  his  gross  annual
      salary of  �21,329,  confirmation  of  the  appellant's  ownership  of
      property and land in Taiwan and the appellant's bank statement showing
      savings of TWD 1,001,553, which my  own  investigation  has  shown  is
      currently equivalent to �25,320,  as  consistent  with  the  sponsor's
      evidence before me. It is unfortunate that the entry clearance manager
      did not list the documents produced by the appellant with her  grounds
      of appeal but merely referred to "supporting documents".  Neither  did
      the entry clearance manager  address  the  documents  in  any  detail,
      simply confirming that they had been considered. It seems to me, and I
      find as a fact, that whilst the appellant may not  have  produced  all
      the required evidence to satisfy the specified  evidence  requirements
      in  Appendix  FM-SE  (and  that  is  not  entirely  clear),  she   was
      nevertheless able to show that there were sufficient  funds  available
      to her and the  sponsor  to  meet  the  level  of  funds  required  in
      paragraph E-ECP.3.1 and E-ECP.3.2.

  23. Of course the position has now changed, as [SM] was unable to take  up
      the employment offered at CWK, as he had to look  after  his  daughter
      owing to the absence of the appellant, and therefore could not take up
      a full-time job. Instead he has been working on a self-employed basis.
      [SM]'s oral evidence was that he could earn around �600 a  week  in  a
      good week, but otherwise he averaged at around  �1600  a  month.  When
      taken together with the evidence of the appellant's savings, it  seems
      to me again that there were sufficient  funds  to  meet  the  relevant
      level required under the immigration rules. Clearly  the  requirements
      of the rules could not be met, as that was not evidenced by any of the
      required specified evidence, but it is a matter of weight to be  taken
      into consideration in assessing proportionality  under  Article  8.  I
      note that Ms Pal's concern was  a  lack  of  documentary  evidence  to
      support the sponsor's claim to  have  sufficient  funds  to  meet  the
      required level, but at  no  point  was  there  any  challenge  to  the
      sponsor's credibility and his evidence that further third-party  funds
      were available from his father and step-father. I found the sponsor to
      be entirely credible and have no doubt that the appellant  would  have
      access to sufficient funds so as not to require  assistance  from  the
      state, bearing in mind that [SM] would be able to  earn  more  if  his
      wife were in the UK and he did not need to be home by 4pm for [M]  and
      that the appellant would be able  to  work  in  one  of  his  mother's
      friends' restaurants.

  24. I turn, therefore, to the question of proportionality under Article 8,
      which is the only  matter  to  be  determined,  Ms  Pal  having  quite
      properly conceded that family life has been established and  that  the
      respondent's decision interferes with that family life being conducted
      in the UK. I have to give substantial weight  to  the  fact  that  the
      appellant cannot meet the requirements of the immigration rules,  both
      in relation to the financial requirements  and  the  English  language
      requirement and to  the  strong  public  interest  in  maintaining  an
      effective immigration control. In cases where the requirements of  the
      immigration rules cannot be met there  have  to  be  truly  compelling
      circumstances justifying a grant  of  leave  outside  the  immigration
      rules.


  25. It seems to me that this is an unusual case which must be decided very
      much on its own particular facts and circumstances. It also  seems  to
      me  that  there  are  a  number   of   considerations   which,   taken
      individually, may not assist the appellant in the balancing  exercise,
      but which taken cumulatively lead me to conclude that  there  are,  in
      this case, particularly compelling circumstances. With regard  to  the
      appellant's inability  to  meet  the  financial  requirements  of  the
      immigration rules, I have found that this is based upon a  failure  to
      provide specified evidence rather than an inability to meet the  level
      of funds required by the immigration rules. On the evidence  available
      to me, including the sponsor's oral evidence, I find  that  there  are
      sufficient funds for the appellant  to  be  maintained  to  the  level
      required in the immigration rules. I find no reason to  conclude  that
      the appellant would become a burden on the state, in terms of  section
      117B(3), although I accept that that in itself  is  a  neutral  factor
      when considering the public  interest.  As  to  the  English  language
      requirement, the appellant cannot meet that requirement  in  terms  of
      test results. However I accept [SM]'s evidence that  she  is  able  to
      speak English and that he would always speak to her in English  whilst
      she replied in Mandarin. I take  account  of  the  evidence,  which  I
      accept, that the appellant made enquiries about the  English  language
      requirement and was advised (wrongly) by UK Visas  that  she  did  not
      need to take the test because of her family circumstances. I note that
      there is evidence to show that she has been attending English language
      lessons and I accept [SM]'s oral evidence that she is trying  hard  to
      pass the required test. I have no doubt  at  all  that,  but  for  the
      incorrect advice she received, the  approach  taken  to  meeting  this
      requirement would, from the start, have been  significantly  different
      and the outcome may or may not have been different.

  26. A matter of significant weight, albeit not the primary  consideration,
      is the best interests of [M], who experienced the  distress  of  being
      separated from her mother when the family arrived in the  UK  and  her
      mother was immediately sent back to Taiwan. [M]  has  now  been  apart
      from her mother for over a year and is in a crucial year in  terms  of
      her education, with her GCSEs looming in the summer. I have had regard
      to a letter of support from  her  school,  dated  26  September  2016,
      referring to the significant effect her mother's presence  would  have
      on helping her achieve the best grades possible and have a happy  life
      in the UK. Whilst [M] has her father in the UK, he is not able to deal
      with the "women's issues" which arise and he is  unable  to  work  the
      hours he wishes as he has to be  home  early  for  [M]'s  return  from
      school. Clearly the separation of the family is causing much  distress
      to all parties and in particular to [M] and must inevitably have  some
      impact upon her preparation for and performance during  the  important
      period of her GCSE year at school, something  that  may  well  have  a
      lasting effect upon the direction of her ongoing education.


  27. Of course there is the possibility of [SM] and [M] returning to Taiwan
      to join the appellant. However I accept that that would be  difficult,
      given that [M] is in the middle of her GCSE year and that the  purpose
      of relocating to the UK was to be with  family  members  here  and  to
      provide support to [SM]'s step-father after the sudden  death  of  his
      wife.


  28. For all of these reasons, and emphasising the unique circumstances  of
      this case, I conclude that the appellant has  demonstrated  compelling
      circumstances justifying  a  grant  of  entry  clearance  outside  the
      immigration rules. I conclude that the public interest  considerations
      arising from the appellant's inability to  pass  an  English  language
      test and her failure to provide the specified documentary evidence  in
      relation to the funds available for her  maintenance  in  the  UK  are
      outweighed by the various and cumulative other  factors  including  in
      particular the adequacy of the funds  available  for  the  appellant's
      maintenance, the effect of enforced separation on a sixteen  year  old
      marriage, the best interests of a fifteen  year  old  child  separated
      from her mother at a crucial time in her life and the additional other
      considerations mentioned above.


  29. Accordingly, and acknowledging the significant weight to be  given  to
      the public interest in maintaining  immigration  control,  I  conclude
      that the refusal of entry clearance to the appellant  on  the  unusual
      facts of this particular case is disproportionate  and  in  breach  of
      Article 8. The appeal is allowed on Article  8  grounds,  outside  the
      immigration rules.

DECISION

  30. The making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  an
      error on a point of law. The decision is set aside and is  re-made  by
      allowing the appeal.
