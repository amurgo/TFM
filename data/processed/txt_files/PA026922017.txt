For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier Tribunal Judge A
    M S Green, promulgated on 5 May 2017.

 2. The grounds of appeal focus firstly on �14, which begins, "I found  the
    appellant to be a reliable witness.  I have no concerns about  how  she
    behaved under cross-examination", but goes on to find that a series  of
    matters "count against her general credibility".  She is then found  at
    �15 to be credible only to a quite limited  extent.   The  grounds  say
    this is irrational,  no  explanation  being  given  for  a  distinction
    between "reliability" and "general credibility".

 3. The grounds  say  further  that  the  finding  based  on  a  "screening
    interview" was inadequate, given  the  judge's  acknowledgment  of  the
    limitations of answers given at such interviews,  and  the  appellant's
    circumstances at the time; that the assessment of  internal  relocation
    failed to take account of the appellant's personal  circumstances;  and
    there was a failure to make a finding on whether the  appellant's  home
    is in a "contested area".

 4. The respondent conceded that the decision erred in law, principally  on
    the first issue raised, but also on general risk (in terms  of  article
    15 (c) of the directive and of article 3 ECHR) and on  relocation,  and
    fell to be set aside and remade, applying country guidance as corrected
    and set out as an annex to AA (Iraq) [2017] EWCA Civ 944 (which was not
    available at the time of the hearing in the FtT).

 5. The following outcome is as agreed between the parties.   The  decision
    of the FtT is set aside and stands only as a record of what was said at
    the hearing.  The nature of the case is such that it is appropriate  in
    terms of section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement
    7.2 to remit the case to the FtT for an entirely  fresh  hearing.   The
    member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case  are  not  to  include
    Judge A M S Green.

 6. An anonymity direction made by the FtT remains in place.
