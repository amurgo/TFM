Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Howells (counsel instructed by N C Brother
Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is the appeal of Binod Gurung, a  citizen  of  Nepal  born  11
         February 1988, against the decision  of  5  June  2014  to  make  a
         deportation order against him under the UK Borders Act 2007.

      2. The Appellant arrived in  the  United  Kingdom  when  he  was  aged
         sixteen, being granted indefinite leave to  enter  on  13  November
         2006, to join his father who had himself  been  granted  indefinite
         leave here earlier in 2006 having served as a Gurkha soldier in the
         British Army for fifteen years, retiring on 2 May 1995.

      3. The Appellant has a history of drug offences in the United  Kingdom
         arising particularly from incidents in July and November 2013.  The
         sentencing judge noted that  he  had  pleaded  guilty  to  offences
         committed in July 2013 on the basis  that  he  was  a  heroin  user
         awaiting  rehabilitation,  in  debt  to  his   supplier   who   was
         threatening him. During the period between entering  the  plea  and
         sentencing  he  was  again  arrested,  on  21  November  2013,  for
         possession of heroin and crack cocaine with intent to supply. On 10
         January 2014 he was sentenced to 36 months imprisonment,  receiving
         consecutive sentences of 15 and 21 months for the two offences.

      4. This criminality having come to the attention of the  Secretary  of
         State, she wrote to him on 24 February 2014  to  say  that  in  the
         light of the severity of his offending, she deemed his  deportation
         as conductive to the public good, and intended to pursue  automatic
         deportation proceedings against him under the UK Borders  Act  2007
         unless he could establish that one of the exceptions  provided  for
         in section 33 thereof applied to him.

      5. On 11 March 2014  the  Appellant's  representatives  wrote  to  the
         Respondent putting a human rights claim based  on  the  Appellant's
         private and family life here. He  lived  in  Basingstoke  with  his
         family. He had no close family remaining in Nepal, and no social or
         economic  support  network  there;  he  had  lost  whatever  social
         contacts he may have previously held there, not least because  many
         of his former schoolmates were now  based  in  the  United  Kingdom
         where they had moved  and  settled.  His  family  had  retained  no
         property in the  country  and  he  would  accordingly  struggle  to
         establish himself on a return given that he lacked resources of his
         own and there were limited economic and employment opportunities in
         Nepal.  He  had  consistently  lived  with  his  parents  and  been
         financially supported by them. His offending had been motivated  by
         his own addiction and his fear of his own drug dealer who  supplied
         him, to whom he had fallen  into  debt.  It  was  argued  that  the
         legality of his expulsion should not be assessed without regard  to
         the  historic  injustice  that  had  afflicted  Gurkhas  and  their
         dependants, for had he been able to  come  to  the  United  Kingdom
         before 2006, he would have had the opportunity  to  obtain  British
         citizenship sooner: his father had, because of the  timing  of  his
         own arrival here, been unable to naturalise as  a  British  citizen
         until the Appellant was an  adult,  by  which  time  his  offending
         precluded any application for citizenship in his own right.

      6. Unswayed by those representations, on 5 June 2014 the Secretary  of
         State made  a  deportation  order  against  the  Appellant,  giving
         reasons dated 11 June 2014 in which she found that the  Appellant's
         departure from the  United  Kingdom  would  not  disproportionately
         interfere  with  his  private  and  family  life.  He  presented  a
         significant and escalating  risk  of  harm  to  potential  victims,
         bearing in mind his conduct between plea and sentencing;  this  was
         of grave concern and it  was  not  considered  reasonable  for  the
         public to face the risks he  posed.  Drugs  offending  had  a  wide
         impact on the health and morals of the community at  large  bearing
         in mind the crimes and anti-social behaviour that followed  in  its
         wake. He had spent his youth and formative years in Nepal, where he
         spoke the language, and the seven and a half years he had lived  in
         this country were not accepted as implying that he had severed  all
         of his social ties abroad, albeit that  it  was  accepted  that  he
         lacked family support in Nepal  now;  any  friendships  established
         here could be maintained via modern  means  of  communication.  The
         decision  maker  concluded   that   there   were   no   exceptional
         circumstances  present  to  suggest  that  his  removal  would   be
         disproportionate to any private and family  life  established  here
         and so he did  not  fall  within  the  human  rights  exception  to
         deportation under section 33 of the UK Borders Act 2007.

      7. The Appellant brought an appeal against  that  decision  which  was
         determined on 17 December 2014 by Judge Rothwell and Ms Singer as a
         Panel in the First-tier Tribunal. He gave evidence stating that  he
         was single and had no children, was  educated  with  qualifications
         from Nepal, where he still had friends; his father had no  siblings
         and his mother's siblings were in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom;
         his grandparents were either deceased or in this  country.  He  had
         worked in the  United  Kingdom  for  a  Sainsbury's  warehouse  and
         McDonalds, and paid tax and national insurance. When he  had  lived
         at home and worked he had given his parents some money;  he  had  a
         good relationship with them and they  still  saw  one  another  for
         meals and on Sundays. His father had helped him  with  attending  a
         detoxification centre for three to four weeks. He had  taken  drugs
         courses in prison; he felt that he was a  changed  person.  He  had
         taken cannabis for around two years before  coming  to  the  United
         Kingdom. Once here, he sold cocaine to close friends  to  fund  his
         own habit.

      8. His father gave evidence and said that he had been discharged  from
         the British Army in the United Kingdom and then went to  Nepal  for
         four months, and then onto Hong Kong, before  returning  to  settle
         here. He had arrived in 2006, the  Appellant  arriving  some  eight
         months later, and his own wife some six or seven months thereafter.
         He had last been in Nepal in 2009 when he sold  his  property.  His
         wife had been there some  years  ago.  He  and  the  Appellant  had
         previously lived separately for many years as his son had  been  at
         boarding school. The Appellant had first gone to rehabilitation for
         drug use in 2010, paid for by the local council; he could  not  say
         when he resumed his addiction or why he  had  taken  drugs  in  the
         first place. He did not know the Appellant's friends. The Appellant
         had been in trouble for shoplifting in 2009, for  possessing  drugs
         in 2011, and for supplying Class A drugs in 2012.  The  family  had
         had to pay �400 to a  gangster;  a  CCTV  camera  was  subsequently
         installed at their home for security reasons after  they  told  the
         police.

      9.  The  Panel  observed  that  very  little  information   had   been
         forthcoming about  the  Appellant's  personal  circumstances.  They
         nevertheless found that he had formed a private life here given his
         lawful residence since 2006, his relationships with his parents and
         brother, and his work. They did not accept that he could be said to
         have maintained  family  life  here,  however,  as  whilst  he  had
         intermittently cohabited with his parents he had  not  continuously
         been emotionally and financially dependent on them. Whilst  he  had
         sometimes contributed to the  family  income,  he  had  retained  a
         degree of financial  independence,  and  had  not  lived  with  his
         parents whilst at boarding school or whilst his father  was  moving
         around and settling his affairs after leaving the Army. He retained
         social and cultural ties in Nepal where he had lived  for  most  of
         his life and been educated;  and his social  links  in  the  United
         Kingdom  included  socialising  with  members   of   the   diaspora
         community.

     10. They noted that an OASys report of 18 June 2014 confirmed that  the
         Appellant had used cannabis before arriving here. He had  begun  to
         smoke and inject heroin and cocaine. He had bought and  sold  drugs
         for his dealer when he could  not  afford  to  otherwise  fund  his
         habit. He had told the report's writer that his use of drugs was  a
         big mistake and he appeared motivated  to  avoid  reoffending.  The
         writer of the report gave him a low score for re-offending risks.

     11. Central to the Appellant's case before the First-tier Tribunal  was
         his contention that he was only liable to  deportation  because  he
         was not a British citizen, and he had been preparing a  citizenship
         application up to the time that he  offended,  his  parents  having
         lacked the means to support an earlier one. The Panel found that in
         reality he had spent funds that would otherwise have been available
         for other purposes on drugs. He was still dealing  in  2013  whilst
         awaiting a place in  rehabilitation.  He  had  repeatedly  supplied
         drugs to individuals whose existence was already a miserable one. A
         drug rehabilitation report in November 2013 recorded his  claim  to
         have learned a lot regarding relapse prevention during his time  at
         the Baytrees institution; he had learned to be more honest, to be a
         better role model and to respect his parents.  They  observed  that
         only two weeks after that report was written he  was  arrested  for
         possessing heroin and crack cocaine with intent to supply.  In  all
         the circumstances they found that the public interest was in favour
         of his deportation and outweighed the limited private life  he  had
         established in the United Kingdom.

     12. The Panel concluded at [60]

             "... [t]he issue of the historical injustice towards  Ghurkhas
             [was]  part  of  [the]  balancing  exercise  in  relation   to
             proportionality. The countervailing  public  interest  is  now
             contained in s.117 and this was not the case when the cases of
             Ghising and Dewan which is an unreported decision  based  upon
             the  historical  injustice  in   deportation   appeals   [were
             decided]. The issue  in  Dewan  was  but  for  the  historical
             injustice  the  Appellant  would  have  not  been  liable   to
             deportation as he would  have  been  a  British  citizen.  But
             [this] Appellant was allowed to enter the  United  Kingdom  in
             2006 and he came to  the  United  Kingdom  when  he  was  over
             eighteen. Therefore ... the historical wrong was corrected."

     13. Grounds of appeal argued that the relevance of  historic  injustice
         had been misunderstood by the First-tier  Tribunal.  Permission  to
         appeal having been refused by  Judge  Ransley  for  the  First-tier
         Tribunal, it was granted in the Upper Tribunal by Judge Allen on 27
         April 2015 on the grounds that there was an arguable  issue  as  to
         whether  the  historic  injustice   to   the   Gurkhas   had   been
         appropriately treated in the proportionality balance.

     14. The appeal came on for hearing on 29 June 2015 and the parties were
         agreed that it was appropriate for the Upper Tribunal to proceed to
         determine the substance of the appeal based on the findings of  the
         First-tier Tribunal in the event that an error of law was  detected
         in the decision below.

     15. The useful skeleton argument provided by Mr Howells forms the basis
         of the Appellant's case. The Appellant had lived in a close  family
         unit for most of his life. The case did not fall within the highest
         band  of  offending  where  the  public  interest   would   require
         deportation only where there are  "very  compelling  circumstances"
         over and above those otherwise  required  by  the  Rules.  Relevant
         considerations here were the Appellant's guilty plea, remorse,  low
         risk of re-offending according to the OASys report, detoxification,
         attempts at rehabilitation, connections in this country and lack of
         links abroad, all read in the light of the historic  wrong  whereby
         the Appellant had lost  out  on  the  ability  to  acquire  British
         citizenship  by  naturalisation  following   five   years'   lawful
         residence in this country at the time his father retired  from  the
         British Army in 1995.

     16. For the Respondent it was submitted that the Appellant had not,  on
         the findings below, established family life in the United  Kingdom,
         and his private life was not strong enough to outweigh  the  public
         interest in removing  him  from  the  country  given  his  repeated
         offending. The high threshold required by the Immigration Rules  on
         deportation, given the public policy expressed by  the  UK  Borders
         Act 2007 and its automatic deportation  provisions,  had  not  been
         crossed here and any historic  injustice  was  too  remote  to  the
         Appellant's offending to be relevant.

    Findings and Reasons

    Error of law

     17. As already noted, permission to appeal was granted on the  question
         of the relevance of the historic injustice, and all turns for  this
         Appellant  on  that  factor's   impact   on   the   assessment   of
         proportionality. Mr Howells argued that, but  for  the  failure  to
         permit his father to access the right to indefinite leave to remain
         sooner after his discharge from the British  Army  than  2006,  the
         Appellant would have been living in the United Kingdom and obtained
         nationality. The Respondent contended that there  was  no  material
         causative effect.

     18. In years past, soldiers of the British Army who  were  Commonwealth
         citizens were frequently discharged in the United Kingdom and  thus
         able to access the Armed Forces Concession permitting them to  then
         apply  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  here.  Driven   by   the
         considerations  identified  in  Limbu  [2008]  EWHC  2261  (Admin),
         domestic immigration policy has recognised that the failure to give
         Gurkhas  access  to  that  migration  route  (because   they   were
         discharged in Nepal, and that Concession did not apply to those who
         would have to seek leave to enter rather than leave to remain)  was
         a matter which required the  exercise  of  discretion  outside  the
         Rules in order to avoid the disadvantage  that  otherwise  attended
         the applications of their dependent children  and  other  relatives
         who might have become adults at a  time  when  a  potential  Gurkha
         sponsor was unable to facilitate their settlement here. A series of
         judicial decisions  has  recognised  that  the  Gurkhas'  treatment
         amounted to a historic wrong which  demanded  attention  when  such
         applications were considered and  when,  if  relevant  family  life
         links were established, the balance of proportionality came  to  be
         assessed. As the Court stated in Gurung and others [2013] EWCA  Civ
         8 at [42]:

             "If a Gurkha can show that but for the historic  injustice  he
             would have settled in the UK at  a  time  when  his  dependent
             (now) adult child would have been able to accompany him  as  a
             dependent child under the age of 18 that is  a  strong  reason
             for holding that it is proportionate to permit the adult child
             to join his family now."

     19. Nevertheless, whilst the proportionality balance may often swing in
         favour of the dependents of Gurkhas  because  of  this  feature  of
         their cases, the historic wrong does not  immunise  them  from  the
         invocation  of  other   public   interest   considerations   beyond
         immigration control. As was noted by the Upper Tribunal in  Ghising
         & Ors (Ghurkhas/BOCs: historic wrong; weight) (Nepal)  [2013]  UKUT
         567 (IAC):

             "If the Respondent can point to matters  over  and  above  the
             "public interest in maintaining of a firm immigration policy",
             which argue in favour of removal or the refusal  of  leave  to
             enter, these must be given appropriate weight in  the  balance
             in the Respondent's favour. Thus, a  bad  immigration  history
             and/or criminal behaviour may still be sufficient to  outweigh
             the powerful factors bearing on the Appellant's side. Being an
             adult  child  of  a  UK  settled  Gurkha   ex-serviceman   is,
             therefore, not a "trump card"

     20. Nevertheless, sounding as it does in the context  of  Article  8(2)
         and the assessment of proportionality rather than arising vis-�-vis
         Article 8(1) and the original existence of private and family  life
         (see Sedley LJ in Patel v ECO Mumbai [2010] EWCA Civ 17  at  [14]),
         Article 8, and with it the historic  injustice  principle,  has  no
         purchase  where  the  foundational  Article  8   rights   are   not
         established in the first place.

     21. Given the importance attributed to the historic  injustice  by  the
         authorities, we accept that in principle it may bear  not  only  on
         the grant of leave to enter the country, indefinite  or  otherwise,
         but also upon the subsequent attainment of citizenship,  given  the
         close link between attaining citizenship and prior residence in the
         United Kingdom. A similar principle can be seen in  Johnson  [2014]
         EWHC 2386 (Admin) where Dingemans J recognised that there might  be
         unlawful  discrimination  with  respect  to  a  person's  attempted
         deportation where on balance of probabilities  an  application  for
         British citizenship would have been made during their minority  had
         the law permitted it where their current treatment  was  materially
         due to their being born out of wedlock.

     22. In SL Vietnam [2010] EWCA Civ 225, Patten LJ at [55] and Ward LJ at
         [61] left open the possibility that a lack  of  immigration  status
         might be relevant to a young person's offending.  It  seems  to  us
         that there might be cases where a delay in gaining settlement,  and
         thus in having  an  opportunity  to  seek  citizenship,  materially
         caused by the historic injustice, should be taken into account.  We
         accept that where, on balance of probabilities, an application  for
         citizenship would have been  made  and  granted  had  an  Appellant
         arrived in  this  country  earlier  than  they  did,  the  historic
         injustice that  delayed  their  arrival  may  be  relevant  to  the
         assessment of the public interest in their deportation.

     23. However the link between the loss of an opportunity to settle as  a
         dependent relative and the wrongful delay in permitting  access  to
         such settlement due to the timing of a Gurkha's discharge from  the
         British Army is a much more direct one than that between  the  same
         injustice and liability to deportation based on such a  dependent's
         criminality. A migrant can normally be assumed  to  be  responsible
         for their own adherence to the laws of this country.

     24. It is our view that for a causative link between the attainment  of
         nationality and the 'historic wrong to Gurkhas' to be demonstrated,
         it would be necessary for the relevant dependent to establish  that
         the  established  historic  wrong  i.e.  the  delay  in   obtaining
         settlement in this country, contributed  towards  their  offending,
         and thus to their liability to deportation; a matter of fact to  be
         determined in each case.

     25. In our conclusion the First-tier Tribunal,  in  stating  that  "the
         historical wrong was corrected" by the Appellant's admission to the
         United Kingdom in 2006, failed to have regard to the breadth of the
         principles identified above,  which  potentially  extend  beyond  a
         wrongful delay in  being  able  to  apply  for  settlement  to  the
         subsequent ability to apply for British citizenship.  That  was  an
         error of law which we find to be a material one given  that  it  is
         not possible to know what weight  they  would  have  afforded  this
         issue had they properly taken it into account.

    Remaking the Decision on Appeal

     26. The relevant Immigration Rules are at Part 13 of HC 395:

             "A398. These rules apply where:

             (a) a foreign criminal liable to deportation claims  that  his
             deportation  would  be  contrary  to  the   United   Kingdom's
             obligations under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention;

             398. Where a person claims that  their  deportation  would  be
             contrary to the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the  Human
             Rights Convention, and ...

             (b) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive  to
             the public good and in the public interest because  they  have
             been  convicted  of  an  offence  for  which  they  have  been
             sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but
             at least 12 months;

             The Secretary of State in assessing that claim  will  consider
             whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not, the
             public interest in deportation  will  only  be  outweighed  by
             other factors where there are  very  compelling  circumstances
             over and above those described in paragraph 399 and 399A.

             ...

             399A. This paragraph applies where  paragraph  398(b)  or  (c)
             applies if -

             (a) the person has been lawfully resident in the UK  for  most
             of his life; and

             (b) he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and

             (c)  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles   to   his
             integration into the country to which it  is  proposed  he  is
             deported."

     27. The sentence imposed on  the  Appellant  for  his  offending  falls
         within the range of 12 months and 4 years, and so the question,  in
         so far as his private life stands to be assessed under  the  Rules,
         is whether he has lived here lawfully for most of  his  life,  been
         socially and culturally integrated here, in circumstances where the
         destination of deportation would involve very significant obstacles
         to his integration. The Appellant does not satisfy those  criteria,
         having lived here only some eight and a  half  of  his  twenty  six
         years, whatever level of  integration  he  has  here  and  whatever
         difficulties he would face abroad.

     28. Nevertheless, that is not an end to the analysis, and as stated  by
         Pitchford LJ in AQ & Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 250 at [36], "The  factual
         circumstances to which the rules refer do  not  themselves  exhaust
         the proportionality analysis but they are of substantial weight. To
         that extent only, therefore, the decision maker will be applying  a
         two-stage test." And as the Upper Tribunal put in in MAB (para 399;
         "unduly harsh") [2015] UKUT 435 (IAC):

             "... if an individual cannot succeed under para  399  or  399A
             either because those provisions are not applicable ... because
             the relevant requirements of those  rules  are  not  met,  the
             court or tribunal should move to consider Stage 2. That second
             stage is to consider the issue of proportionality on the basis
             that only "very compelling circumstances over and beyond those
             falling within para 399 or para 399A" can outweigh the  public
             interest."

         So it is necessary to  evaluate  any  other  factors  beyond  those
         identified in Part 13 of the Rules,  having  regard  to  the  "very
         compelling  circumstances"  threshold  and   the   general   policy
         regarding offenders as expressed in the  Rules  and  the  statutory
         provisions  of  ss.117A-117D  of  Part  5A   of   the   Nationality
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. This remains an assessment  within
         the Rules.

     29. As was stated in Gurung [2012] EWCA Civ 62 (a case  involving  much
         more serious offending), in  relation  to  section  32  of  the  UK
         Borders Act 2007, "the nature and seriousness of  the  offence,  as
         measured by the sentence,  do  by  themselves  justify  deportation
         unless an exception recognised by the Act itself applies".  However
         that does not exclude the possibility that the strength of  private
         and family life in the United  Kingdom  might  still  outweigh  the
         public interest in deportation: historic injustice must  duly  take
         its place  amongst  the  potential  factors  for  which  the  Rules
         themselves do not cater.

     30. It has not been suggested that the factual findings made  generally
         by the First-tier  Tribunal  (summarised  at  [9]-[12]  above)  are
         unlawful and so we adopt them as the basis  for  our  own  decision
         making.

     31. We agree with the conclusions of the First-tier Tribunal as to  the
         establishment of Article  8  rights  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The
         circumstances in which  family  life  will  be  recognised  between
         adults has often received discussion in the courts. As  was  stated
         by Sir Stanley Burnton in Singh [2015] EWCA Civ 630:

             "In the case of adults, in the context of immigration control,
             there is no legal or factual presumption as to  the  existence
             or absence of family life for the purposes  of  Article  8.  I
             point out that the approach of  the  European  Commission  for
             Human Rights cited approvingly in Kugathas did not include any
             requirement of exceptionality. It all depends  on  the  facts.
             The love and affection between an adult  and  his  parents  or
             siblings will not of itself justify  a  finding  of  a  family
             life. There has to be something more.  A  young  adult  living
             with his parents or siblings will normally have a family  life
             to be respected under Article 8. A  child  enjoying  a  family
             life with his parents does not suddenly cease to have a family
             life at midnight as he turns 18 years of  age.  On  the  other
             hand, a young adult living independently of  his  parents  may
             well not have a family life for the purposes of Article 8."

     32. Within this fact-sensitive enquiry,  it  is  clearly  possible  for
         factors such as enduring cohabitation or emotional vulnerability to
         provide the  additional  element  that  elevates  natural  familial
         affection to a protected  right  of  family  life.  The  First-tier
         Tribunal was alive to this possibility, though nevertheless did not
         accept  that  family  life  was  established  in  this  case.  They
         concluded that in the light of the Appellant having lived away from
         his parents at boarding school, having been separated from them for
         a while during the migration of the various family members to  this
         country, and then having lived sufficiently independently from them
         in this country that his father did not know who his friends  were,
         the ties between them were not sufficient to establish family life.
         We agree.

     33. The First-tier Tribunal did however accept that the  Appellant  had
         established some degree of private life here, given his  length  of
         residence, history of work and extant if intermittent  relationship
         with his parents.  We  agree  with  the  decision  below  that  the
         evidence put forward was very scant. It  would  seem  that  he  has
         worked at certain times, though he has a history of drugs  use  and
         criminality that has precluded holding down any particular  job  in
         recent years for any extended  period.  There  is  a  rather  vague
         history, alluded to only by his father, to prior offending and drug
         addiction in years past. It is  very  difficult  to  see  that  his
         connections with this  country  are  in  any  way  central  to  the
         Appellant's  identity  or  that  he  would  be   unable   to   form
         relationships with other people in Nepal.

     34. As to the factors identified in section 117B of the NIAA 2002,  the
         appellant is unlikely to be  consistently  financially  independent
         given his chequered past; however, even if he were this  would  not
         alter our conclusion  in  this  appeal.  Whatever  proficiency  the
         appellant has in the English language it is not a matter which  can
         be weighed in his favour in our proportionality assessment.  Whilst
         the appellant has had the advantage  of  settled  status,  his  own
         offending has rendered that precarious. Following  the  requirement
         laid down in section 117B(5) we are required  to,  and  do  in  any
         event, attach little weight to those  parts  of  his  private  life
         which have been built up during the time of such precarious  leave.
         Absent evidence on this issue we treat this as  being  the  limited
         private life developed by the appellant since the date of his first
         conviction.

     35. Moving on, we note the OASys report and its assessment  that  there
         is a low risk of re-offending. As can be seen from our  summary  of
         their reasoning above, the First-tier Tribunal departed  from  that
         finding in their conclusions. That is understandable: it was a very
         generous finding by the probation service given that the  Appellant
         had re-offended in the course of the very criminal proceedings that
         led  to  his  deportation,  particularly   absent   strong   family
         connections that might  ensure  his  rehabilitation.  Although  the
         specialist assessment of the probation service  represents  a  view
         from which the Tribunal should not lightly deviate, see  AM  [2012]
         EWCA Civ 1634 at  [34],  we  agree  that  this  was  one  of  those
         relatively rare cases where such a departure  is  appropriate.  The
         Appellant does represent a sufficient offending risk to pose a real
         threat to the  public  given  his  past  conduct.  Of  course,  re-
         offending is not the only objective at which deportation aims.  The
         three dimensions of the  public  interest  were  identified  in  SE
         Zimbabwe [2014] EWCA Civ 256:

             "... the decision-maker must consider three  separate  aspects
             of the criminal  offence.  These  are  (i)  the  risk  of  re-
             offending, (ii) the need to deter others and (iii) the need to
             express society's revulsion at the criminality."

     36. Whilst in the light of the judge's  sentencing  remarks  summarised
         above the Appellant's offending cannot be  said  to  be  especially
         serious on the scale of drug-related crime and is not of  an  order
         which  necessarily  demands  a  public  expression  of   revulsion,
         nevertheless  the  need  to  deter  other  offenders  is  still   a
         legitimate aim that in itself requires respect (and the deportation
         of foreign criminals is  generally  in  the  public  interest,  see
         section 117C(2) NIAA 2002), particularly when the limited nature of
         the Appellant's private life connections with this country is taken
         into account. So it seems to us that the balance of public interest
         and private right is to  be  resolved  in  favour  of  deportation,
         having regard to the fact that on our findings above  it  is  clear
         that the private life exception countenanced by section 117C(4)  is
         foreclosed to him.

     37. That provisional conclusion is not altered  once  the  question  of
         historic injustice is considered. On the facts of  this  particular
         case we do not accept that there is any causative link between  the
         Appellant's liability to  deportation  and  the  failure  to  grant
         settlement to his father any sooner. It is clear that he  has  used
         his earnings not to save  towards  a  nationality  application  but
         rather to fund his drug addiction. He used  cannabis  regularly  in
         Nepal before moving on to crack cocaine and heroin  in  the  United
         Kingdom, but there is no positive suggestion in the evidence before
         us that it was any disadvantage owing to his family not being  able
         to migrate here sooner  that  led  to  his  problems;  indeed,  his
         criminality only seemed to develop in this country after settlement
         was granted.

    Decision:

    The making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
    making of an error on a point of law and its decision is set aside.

    We re-make the decision in the appeal  by  dismissing  the  appeal.  No
    question of fee award therefore arises.
