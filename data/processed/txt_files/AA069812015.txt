For the Appellant:     Mr A Caskie, Advocate, instructed by Latta & Co.,
Solicitors

For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of China, born on 16 October 1988.  She  has
    not asked for an anonymity order.

 2. The appellant  sought  asylum  on  29  April  2014  based  on  (a)  her
    membership of the China New Democratic Party and (b) breach  of  family
    planning policy, having had two children out of wedlock.

 3. The respondent refused the claim for  reasons  explained  in  a  letter
    dated 9 April 2015.  The matter of political opinion is dealt  with  at
    paragraphs 12 - 15.  The family planning policy issue is dealt with  at
    paragraphs 16 - 25, and resolved by reference  to  background  evidence
    and by applying AX (Family Planning Scheme) China  CG  [2012]  UKUT  97
    (IAC).

 4. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal, on grounds which are
    merely generic and identify no specific issue on which the appeal might
    turn.

 5. First-tier Tribunal Judge Kempton dismissed the appellant's  appeal  by
    determination promulgated on 20 November 2015.

 6. In her grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal, the appellant does  not
    pursue the political opinion issue.  The judge is said to have erred on
    the family planning policy issue by holding that the appellant could be
    required to alter an important aspect of her life  in  order  to  avoid
    persecution, that is, by  consenting  to  invasive  medical  treatment,
    notwithstanding that she has made it clear that she does  not  wish  to
    undergo sterilisation.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted on 9 December 2015.

 8. The respondent filed a response to the grant of  permission,  dated  18
    December 2015.  This accepts under reference to  headnote  (12)  of  AX
    that if an appellant were to be forced to undergo sterilisation against
    her will, that would amount to persecution, and that the  judge  should
    have addressed whether or not the appellant would have been  forced  to
    do so.

 9. The  respondent  says,  however,  that  there  was  no  evidence  of  a
    "crackdown" in the appellant's home hukou area, that she  was  pregnant
    at the time of the hearing, or that her family had been threatened with
    ill-treatment as a result of her breach of the family planning  scheme.
    Thus, in terms of AX, in particular headnote  (11),  the  appeal  would
    have failed in any case, and so the error is immaterial.

10. Mr Caskie conceded at the hearing on 1 February that  if  the  decision
    fell to be remade simply by applying AX,  the  appeal  would  again  be
    dismissed.  However, he referred to a report which was before the First-
    tier Tribunal.  This is by Ms S Gordon, currently a PhD student at  the
    University of Leicester, with relevant  experience  and  qualifications
    set out in her accompanying curriculum vitae.  Mr Caskie said that  her
    information postdates AX, and some of it was acquired  at  first  hand,
    she having quite recently spent 6 months in China.  At paragraph 33 the
    report explains that risk of sterilisation linked to birth registration
    and hence to acquiring hukou applies in all places and all  times,  and
    is not dependent upon local crackdowns.  The appellant  would  have  to
    undergo sterilisation in order to gain access to housing and  education
    for her children.  This went beyond AX.  The determination at paragraph
    35 contains the finding, "I would accept that  ...  she  will  have  to
    undergo sterilisation before she can register the children."  Thus,  Mr
    Caskie argued, on the evidence which was before  the  judge,  including
    the expert report, and on findings of fact which ought to be preserved,
    the appeal should be allowed.

11. Mr Matthews acknowledged that there were submissions to the judge  from
    both sides on whether she ought to go beyond the  country  guidance  in
    AX, and that the rule 24 response oversimplified  the  consequences  of
    the error in the determination.  The submission  based  on  the  expert
    report had to be resolved.  That had to be done by a proper analysis of
    the relevant evidence, both from the appellant and in the  report,  and
    an explanation of why it did or did  not  justify  departure  from  AX.
    That would most conveniently be accomplished by full submissions  at  a
    later date.  It should not be arrived at simply by accepting  what  the
    judge said at paragraph 35, which was not  the  outcome  of  a  correct
    approach, nor by simply accepting that the expert report overrides AX.

12. Mr Caskie argued that the rule 24 response does not seek to revisit the
    factual findings [i.e. the imposition  of  sterilisation  in  order  to
    register the children], and there has been no suggestion that they  are
    perverse.   The  Upper  Tribunal  should  regard  those   findings   as
    untouchable.  Notwithstanding AX, it had been open to the judge to make
    such findings in the appellant's favour, based on  the  expert  report,
    and all that was needed was to correct their logical outcome.

13. I reserved the first stage of my  decision  at  that  point,  following
    which it was issued along the lines of paragraphs 14 - 20 which follow.



14. It is common ground that the determination of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    must be set aside.

15. The judge did not explain why she decided  to  dismiss  the  appeal  in
    respect of family planning for the particular reasons she  gave,  which
    were unprompted by any submission to her, and  which  are  contrary  to
    principle and precedent.  She failed (a) to consider  the  respondent's
    quite extensive reasoning, based both on background evidence and on  AX
    and (b) to consider and resolve the submissions which she recorded from
    both sides on the weight to be given to the expert report, and  on  the
    extent to which AX might no longer hold good.

16. It is good general doctrine  that  findings  of  fact  should  not  too
    readily  be  revisited.   However,  all  depends  on  the   facts   and
    circumstances of  the  particular  case.   The  doctrine  applies  more
    readily to preserving  a  decision  which  has  its  imperfections  but
    remains comprehensible than to preserving findings in a decision  which
    cannot  stand  because  its  outcome  is   based   on   a   fundamental
    misconception.  Of course country guidance must be departed from  where
    that is justified by the evidence, but it would be odd to  reverse  the
    outcome in a case where the submission to that effect is  recorded  but
    not resolved (or not adequately resolved; paragraph 35 is  not  a  good
    enough  explanation  for  preferring  the  expert  evidence  over   the
    guidance).

17. There was no application to lead any further evidence.   The  appellant
    was not found credible on the matter of politician opinion.  That is no
    longer live.  The primary facts related to the family  planning  policy
    issue have not been  the  subject  of  any  credibility  dispute.   The
    question is what conclusions to draw from that  evidence  in  light  of
    country guidance, the further background evidence cited, and the expert
    report.

18. That required  further  submissions,  not  restricted  by  any  of  the
    conclusions drawn by the First-tier Tribunal from the primary evidence.



19. I directed that parties were to file and  to  copy  to  each  other  an
    outline  of  their  submissions  on  the  remaking  of  the   decision,
    referenced to the supporting evidence, by 29 February 2016.

20. The case was then to be listed for further hearing, which took place on
    7 March 2016.

Written submission for the appellant.

21. The issue was whether  to  go  beyond  the  guidance  provided  in  AX,
    considered in December 2011.  In SA (Sri Lanka) [2014] EWCA Civ 683  at
    paragraph 12 the  Court  of  Appeal  said  that  it  was  important  to
    emphasise that  country  guidance  cases  were  no  more  than  factual
    summaries updated from time-to-time to record material changes  in  the
    position on the  ground.   In  this  case  there  was  significant  new
    evidence in the form of the expert report by Ms Gordon, which should be
    accepted.

22. Kennedy v Cordia (Services) LLP (Scotland) [2016] UKSC 6  is  cited  at
    length (thirteen pages) on the correct approach to expert evidence.

23. Paragraph 8 of the submission states that there is clear evidence  from
    Ms Gordon  of  the  changed  situation  based  on  "her  knowledge  and
    experience built both through lengthy and recent periods in  China  and
    from the findings of published research and pooled knowledge".

24. The report of Ms Gordon evidence satisfies  the  criteria  required  of
    expert evidence, and should be accepted by the Upper Tribunal.

Written submission for the SSHD.

25. Paragraphs 1 - 5 of the submission set  out  the  legal  background  on
    departure from country guidance.

26. The report by Ms Gordon falls short of providing the cogent evidence or
    strong grounds needed to depart from AX.

27. In AX, the UT had expert evidence from three sources.

28. Evidence from Professor M Aguilar was given limited weight.

29. The expertise of Dr J Sheehan was accepted.  At paragraph  79  she  was
    recorded as saying that the authorities no longer refused to register a
    child on the family  hukou  even  where  the  child  was  unauthorised.
    Parents sometimes did not seek registration because SUC would  have  to
    be paid.  It was the absence of  hukou  which  caused  educational  and
    other difficulties.   Those  could  be  avoided  if  the  parents  were
    prepared or able to discharge the SUC.  At paragraph 92 the evidence of
    Dr Sheehan was that it was overwhelmingly likely that the appellant  in
    that case, as the mother of four children, would be forced  to  undergo
    sterilisation.

30. There was thirdly the evidence of Professor Fu.  At  paragraph  105  he
    was recorded as saying that incidents were isolated and the authorities
    were now extremely cautious about using force to enforce termination or
    sterilisation,  and  at  paragraph  109  that  foreign  born   children
    identified by overseas birth certificates would be registered.  Whether
    they would be regarded as unauthorised was controversial.  In Guangdong
    they might be so regarded, but not in Hainan.

31. The UT noted some concerns about the limitations of the  evidence  from
    Dr Sheehan and from Professor Fu, and did not say in terms what  weight
    was given to the evidence from Dr Sheehan,  but  broadly  accepted  the
    evidence of Professor Fu.

32. Attention is then drawn to the country guidance given in particular  at
    paragraphs 172, 173 and 176;  paragraph  185,  real  risk  of  forcible
    sterilisation would be persecutory, but the UT was not  satisfied  that
    in general there was "a real risk of forcible sterilisation  of  either
    partner", although  there  had  been  scandals  and  crackdowns".   "We
    recognise... that some of the international reports state that forcible
    sterilisation carries 'fairly frequently';  however,  the  overwhelming
    evidence, and the evidence of Professor Fu (which we accept and  prefer
    on this point) is that the occurrence is limited and therefore, in  our
    judgment, it does not amount to a real risk".

33. On foreign born children the UT said at paragraphs  188  and  189  that
    parents were expected to produce birth certificates  and  to  pay  SUC,
    which even if imposed was not likely to be beyond the means of a couple
    who had lived abroad for some years.  There was very little evidence of
    parents being disproportionately penalised when they returned to  China
    with foreign born children.  In general, no real risk arose.

34. The submission then turns to the report by Ms Gordon.  The evidence she
    cites falls short of showing that it was reasonably likely that a child
    would not be registered because it was unauthorised.  Ms Gordon said at
    paragraph 19 that it was highly likely  that  the  appellant  might  be
    "punished" because  her  children  were  unauthorised.   That  was  not
    inconsistent with the UT's conclusions in AX at paragraphs 188 and 189.
     The report by Ms Gordon  provided  no  basis  for  saying  that  those
    conclusions were wrong.

35. Ms Gordon referred to a social compensation fee, the equivalent of  the
    SUC, but was unable to say  what  it  might  amount  to.   She  used  a
    comparison based on UK income levels "presumably for shock  value,  and
    perhaps indicative of a lack of objectivity and  of  advocacy".   There
    was no reason to suppose that the appellant would not be in a  position
    to pay any SUC for having unauthorised children.  She had been here  as
    a student from 2007 to 2009, with the means to pay fees at  the  higher
    international  student  rate,  and  had  shown  access  to  an   amount
    equivalent to �59,000.  She  had  survived  with  her  children  living
    unlawfully in the UK for five years.  On return she could benefit  from
    the Assisted Voluntary Return programme, a point to which the  UT  gave
    weight in AX at paragraph 204.  Even if SUC were  charged  for  foreign
    born children, the appellant was not likely to be unable to pay it.

36. In any  event,  the  consequences  of  non-payment  of  SUC  would  not
    generally reach the severity threshold  to  amount  to  persecution  or
    serious harm - paragraph 191(9) of AX.

37. The report by Ms  Gordon  next  turned  to  the  likelihood  of  forced
    sterilisation, and cited three examples.  The  first  was  based  on  a
    somewhat ambiguous quotation from the Family Planning Department  (page
    9 of the report) but even  if  to  be  interpreted  as  Ms  Gordon  put
    forward, it was one example and not  sufficient  to  establish  general
    risk of forced sterilisation in order to obtain hukou.  The report then
    gave an example of a lady from Fujian province who said  that  pressure
    was applied so as to leave no option, and  a  third  such  example  was
    provided at the foot of paragraph 36 of  the  report.   The  report  at
    paragraph 38 made unsupportable assertions.  The author said  that  she
    had never heard of a woman refusing to accept an IUD after the birth of
    the first child, but given the number of women in China with more  than
    one child that could not be correct.  The author said that she did  not
    know of any example of a woman with two children who was  not  required
    by local regulations to accept an IUD insertion or  sterilisation,  but
    that was again an assertion  unsupported  by  research.   The  author's
    reliance on a decision of the US Court of Appeals for the  7th  Circuit
    was no support for such a conclusion, for which reference was  made  to
    DL [2014] CSOH 147.   The  position  of  Ms  Gordon  that  parents  who
    breached family planning policy were often prevented  from  registering
    their child until they had paid  SUC  with  cases  of  prevention  from
    obtaining hukou unless  the  parents  submitted  to  sterilisation  was
    general and unspecific.  Her report did not show a likelihood that this
    might happen.

38. The risk of forced sterilisation through pressure was  clearly  a  live
    matter in  AX,  evidence  about  which  was  recorded  for  example  at
    paragraph 92.  The UT, based on extensive evidence,  found  no  general
    such risk, apart from "crackdowns".  Ms Gordon's report was  no  cogent
    basis for going further.

39. Ms Gordon's final  point  on  the  matter  was  that  unless  a  parent
    submitted to sterilisation hukou would be refused, but again there  was
    no cogent basis for departing from AX.  Even if Ms Gordon  was  correct
    that  unless  the  appellant  submitted  to  insertion  of  an  IUD  or
    sterilisation her children would be denied hukou and thus an  education
    (which the respondent did not accept) the report left  out  of  account
    that there is a private educational system in China, and that AX  found
    that having to pay for education  did  not,  without  more,  amount  to
    persecution.

40. The evidence in AX had been that hundreds of thousands of  unauthorised
    children are born every year in China, that family  planning  officials
    are required to register them once an SUC has been paid, and there  was
    no  incentive  to  refuse  to  register  them  as  fines  formed  as  a
    significant source of income.  Whether registered or not there would be
    no disproportionate breach of Article 8.  The  best  interests  of  the
    children were to be with their mother whether in China or  in  the  UK.
    The high point of any argument was that they might not  be  registered,
    in which case they would be barred from  state  but  not  from  private
    education.  Their status would not preclude access  to  healthcare  and
    there was no reliable evidence that not being registered would  have  a
    lasting impact on their wellbeing.  If there were  any  impact  on  the
    best interests of  the  children,  it  was  outweighed  by  the  public
    interest.

Oral submissions for appellant.

41. Mr Caskie referred to the report at  paragraphs  33,  38  and  40.   He
    submitted that although the examples given by the  author  were  to  an
    extent anecdotal, the evidence to which she referred was sufficient  to
    show that the risk of sterilisation was not confined to local cutdowns,
    but was general.  Figures at paragraph 44 showed that sterilisation  or
    the use of an IUD must apply to some 83% of the population.  The author
    showed that internal relocation  might  help  the  appellant  to  avoid
    sterilisation or IUD insertion, but not to obtain  hukou.   A  risk  of
    enforced sterilisation was not restricted to those cases where physical
    coercion was used.  Having to submit to an invasive  medical  procedure
    against one's will amounted to persecution or ill-treatment, and was  a
    risk which would  qualify  the  appellant  as  a  refugee,  within  the
    particular social group of women from China who do not wish to  undergo
    sterilisation or the insertion of an IUD.  The appellant  might  submit
    to these procedures in order to obtain hukou for her children, but that
    would amount to an alteration of behaviour which under  the  principles
    of HJ (Iran) should be left  out  of  account  in  recognition  of  her
    refugee status.  This was a step which was missing from  the  logic  of
    AX.

42. Mr Caskie said finally that on reflection the logic of  his  submission
    was more to the effect that this point was  overlooked  in  AX,  rather
    than that the underlying evidence was significantly different from that
    which was before the Tribunal in AX.  The alternative of hiding away to
    avoid the pressure to have an IUD inserted or to undergo sterilisation,
    or choosing to submit, amounted to a need for  protection.   There  was
    also the point that an appellant could not be required to give  up  her
    Article 12 right to found a family.

Oral submission for SSHD.

43. Further to his written submission, Mr Matthews said that the report  of
    Ms Gordon was in some parts inconsistent and unclear.  For example,  in
    the first sentence of paragraph 43 the  author  said  that  parents  in
    breach of family planning policy were often prevented from  registering
    their children with hukou until they had paid the  social  compensation
    fee.  In the next sentence, the author  said  there  were  cases  where
    parents were also prevented from registering their child with hukou  if
    they refused to submit to sterilisation.  This was further contradicted
    at paragraph 72 where the author said that there was a very  high  risk
    that the appellant would be required to undergo sterilisation, enforced
    through administrative pressure such  as  withholding  of  hukou.   The
    report was inconsistent in its use of language and as to the  level  of
    risk, and its conclusions were not justified  by  the  evidence  cited.
    The evidence was no stronger than in AX.  At most  the  consequence  of
    having no hukou was a loss of access  to  state  education,  which  had
    limited impact.  It was not the infraction of  a  core  right,  private
    schools being widely available and commonly  used.   Medical  treatment
    had to be paid for whether or not children had hukou.  That outcome had
    been found in AX not to justify a protection claim.  In any event,  the
    appellant clearly came from a family of substantial means.  The need to
    pay for schooling for her children was the  height  of  her  case,  and
    would not make her a refugee.

Final reply for appellant.

44. Although the respondent pointed to the appellant  at  one  time  having
    access to �59,000, that was  years  ago.   She  is  currently  on  NASS
    support.  The Secretary of State supplies that support, and  could  not
    have matters both ways.  There was evidence that parents in  breach  of
    family planning policies might often be prevented from obtaining  hukou
    for  their  children,  and  the  likely  consequences  were  enough  to
    establish a need for protection.

Conclusions.

45. Partes were in agreement that the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    could not stand.  I have given  my  reasons  for  declining  simply  to
    reverse that decision.  Although the parties' respective submissions on
    remaking the decision are set out above at some length, I can state  my
    conclusions fairly briefly.

46. The submission for the appellant is long on the correct legal  approach
    to expert evidence, but on that the parties are  not  significantly  at
    issue.  It  is  shorter  on  what  the  evidence  actually  says.   The
    respondent's submission focused more accurately on the evidence, and on
    a comparison with the consideration in AX - which are of  the  essence,
    if guidance is to be superseded.

47. The report by Ms Gordon is based on few examples and on rather sweeping
    assertions.  A good example was taken by Mr Matthews from paragraph  38
    of the report, pointing out that although the author had never heard of
    a woman refusing an IUD after her first child, there  are  millions  of
    second and subsequent children in China.  The report does not bear  out
    its contentions by reference  to  the  specific  evidence  which  might
    justify departing from the conclusions in AX.

48. In particular, there is no substantial evidence in  the  report  by  Ms
    Gordon or from any other source to show that sterilisation  is  carried
    out by force other than during local crackdowns, as found in AX.

49. Mr Caskie emphasised that AX was decided some time ago, but  there  was
    no evidence produced to show force being used to any significant extent
    at any date later than that of the evidence before the UT in AX.

50. The general tenor of the background evidence is  in  the  direction  of
    relaxation of family planning policy, and of its enforcement, in recent
    years.

51. The evidence that the appellant is  likely  to  be  forced  to  undergo
    insertion of an IUD or sterilisation in order to obtain hukou  for  her
    children is lacking.  The evidence is  rather  that  on  production  of
    their UK birth certificates and (perhaps) on payment of SUC  or  social
    compensation fees, the children will be registered.

52. If payment is required, there is no  good  reason  to  think  that  the
    appellant would be unable to comply.  She is from a relatively well off
    background. She has the opportunity to return with  financial  benefits
    provided by the respondent.

53. Denial of hukou is a situation faced on official figures by at least 13
    million children in China in 2010, and on further evidence mentioned by
    Ms Gordon at paragraphs 48 - 51 of her report the true number may be 30
    million or even more.

54. I do not find that the children in this  case  are  at  risk  of  hukou
    denial, but even if they were, the findings in AX  were  that  millions
    live in that situation without suffering consequences which  give  rise
    to entitlement to international protection.  No evidence has been shown
    to justify going beyond AX in this branch of the case.

55. The appellant's argument towards the end veered towards new  territory,
    which was barely opened up for exploration.    It  is  not  immediately
    obvious that it  has  been  overlooked  to  date  that  the  principles
    explained in HJ and HT [2010] UKSC 31 open up an alternative  route  to
    protection for women from China.  I see in this  only  another  way  of
    raising the same point about being protected from  bodily  invasion,  a
    risk which I have not found to be established.
