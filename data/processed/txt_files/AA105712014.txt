    Representation:
    For the Appellant: No appearance
    For the Respondent:     Mr Harrison (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The First-tier Tribunal made an anonymity  direction  and  pursuant  to
    Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and I see
    no reason to alter that order.

 2. The Appellant is a citizen  of  Pakistan.  The  appellant  entered  the
    United Kingdom on September 21, 2014 with valid entry clearance and  on
    November 3, 2014 he claimed asylum.  The respondent refused his  asylum
    claim under paragraph 336 HC 395 and on the same day took a decision to
    remove him pursuant to paragraphs  8  to  10A  of  schedule  2  to  the
    Immigration Act 1971.

 3. The appellant appealed this decision on December 4, 2014 under  section
    82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 4. The  appeal  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  McCall
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") on January 16, 2015  and  in  a
    decision promulgated on February 2, 2015 he refused the appeal  on  all
    grounds.

 5. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on September 22, 2014 submitting
    the FtTJ had erred materially in law. Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
    Robertson granted permission to appeal on February 18, 2015

 6. The matter came before me on the above  date  and  the  respondent  was
    represented as set out above. There was no  appearance  by  either  the
    appellant or his representatives.

PRELIMINARY MATTER

 7. Mr Harrison informed me that the appellant had voluntarily returned  to
    Pakistan on February  27,  2015.  He  handed  to  me  evidence  of  his
    departure in the form of flight bookings, letter  from  Refugee  Action
    and a screen shot from the Home office system.

 8. Having reviewed these documents I was satisfied the appellant had  left
    the United Kingdom and under Rule 17A of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) rules 2008 the appeal is to be treated as abandoned.

 9. I therefore treat the appeal as abandoned and the FtTJ's decision shall
    stand.

DECISION

10. The appeal is abandoned. I uphold the  determination  and  dismiss  the
    appeal.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The appeal was dismissed and I make no fee award.
