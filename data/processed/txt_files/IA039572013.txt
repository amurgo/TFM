For the Appellant:  In person
For the Respondent:  Mr Nath, HOPO


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision of Judge Stott made
    on the papers at Birmingham on 5th April 2013.

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Nepal, born on  18th  October  1985.   He
    came to  the  UK  in  January  2007  with  a  student  visa  which  was
    subsequently extended until 1st August 2010.  On 3rd August 2010 he was
    granted leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant
    until 3rd August 2012.

 3. On 1st August 2012  the  Appellant  made  a  combined  application  for
    further leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant and for
    a biometric residence permit. He  was  refused  on  25th  January  2013
    because  he  had  not  provided  a  valid  certificate  of  sponsorship
    reference number  assigned  by  a  Tier  2  licensed  Sponsor  and  the
    Respondent  had  no  record  to  show  that  he  had  been  assigned  a
    certificate of sponsorship at the time of the application.

 4. The judge recorded that it was apparent  from  the  material  that  the
    Appellant submitted an initial application which had  been  refused  on
    1st  October  2012  due  to  certification  problems  in   respect   of
    documentation submitted by the Sponsor.  There then followed  an  email
    exchange which led to another application  being  resubmitted  on  29th
    January 2013, four days after the refusal which was the subject of  the
    appeal before the judge.

 5. Mr Shakya explained to me that his Sponsor had applied for a licence on
    18th July 2012 but  had  been  confused  over  the  requirements.   The
    Sponsor made a second application, which was rejected on 18th  February
    2013, and on the same day made a third  application.  The  licence  was
    eventually granted on 19th March 2013.

 6. The Appellant forwarded the copy of  the  letter  providing  the  valid
    sponsorship licence and certificate of sponsorship on 20th  March  2013
    to the Tribunal but it did not reach the file.

 7. When the judge dismissed the appeal the Appellant sought permission  to
    challenge his decision which was granted by  Judge  Lewis  on  2nd  May
    2013.  Judge Lewis stated that had the judge been able to consider  the
    Appellant's letter of 20th March a different conclusion might have been
     reached.

 8. However, unfortunately for the Appellant that  is  not  the  case.   He
    cannot benefit from the decision in  Khatel  and  Others  (Section  85A
    effect of continuing application) [2013] UKUT 00044 which held that  an
    application for  further  leave  to  remain  is  to  be  treated  as  a
    continuing application, starting  with  the  date  when  it  was  first
    submitted and ending on the date when it is decided.

 9. The certificate of sponsorship in this case was only issued  after  the
    Respondent made her decision. At the date of decision the Appellant was
    not in a position to show  that  he  could  meet  the  requirements  of
    Appendix A (attributes) and the application was properly refused  under
    paragraph 245HD of the Immigration Rules.  The proper course  for  this
    Appellant is a fresh application.





Decision

10. The original judge did not err in law and  his  decision  stands.   The
    Appellant's appeal is dismissed.





Signed                              Date
