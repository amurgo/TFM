For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the appellant against a  decision  of  the  First-
    tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Kelly)  dismissing  his  appeal   against   the
    respondent's decision dated 5 March 2013 refusing his  application  for
    further leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.

2.   There was no appearance by the  appellant.  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    notice of hearing was properly served at the  appellant's  address  for
    service. No explanation has been provided for his  failure  to  appear.
    However, I note that since the hearing of this appeal before the First-
    tier  Tribunal,  the  appellant  has  been  successful  in  an   appeal
    (IA/11782/2015) against an adverse decision relating to his  rights  of
    residence as the spouse of an EEA national exercising treaty rights  in
    the UK. I am satisfied that the proper course is to  proceed  with  the
    hearing of this appeal.

Background

3.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on  4  September  1988.  He
    obtained entry clearance to the UK as a Tier 4 (General) student on  24
    February 2011 valid until 27 June 2012. He received a further extension
    but his college licence was revoked and his leave to  remain  curtailed
    to expire on 17 December 2012.  Meanwhile  the  applicant  had  made  a
    further application on 5 December 2012 to continue his studies.

4.   He was able to meet the requirements of  Appendix  A  (Attributes)  but
    not the requirements of Appendix C.  He  was  required  to  demonstrate
    funds of �9000 held for 28 days as at the date of his  application.  He
    submitted a letter dated 30 November 2012 and a bank statement from  12
    October 2012 to 12 November 2012 from Meezan Bank in Pakistan but using
    the OANDA exchange conversion table,  the  respondent  noted  that  the
    value of Pakistan rupees dropped below the equivalent of  the  required
    amount of �9000 from 16  October  2012  to  22  October  2012.  As  the
    appellant could not meet the requirements of the rules his  application
    was refused.

5.   The appellant appealed against this decision and asked for  his  appeal
    to be decided on the documentary evidence only. He submitted  a  bundle
    of documents in support of his appeal but the judge commented that  the
    appellant did not suggest that the respondent had applied an  incorrect
    conversion rate to  the  balances  of  the  account  or  that  she  had
    inaccurately applied that rate. The appellant merely asserted that  the
    balance of his account remained above the sterling equivalent of  �9000
    at all material times. The judge found that the appellant had failed to
    prove that he met the maintenance requirements of  the  rules  for  the
    relevant period and his appeal was accordingly dismissed.

6.   Permission to  appeal  was  granted  on  the  basis  that  the  grounds
    asserted that the appellant had submitted evidence with his application
    that he had funds in his account throughout the  period  prescribed  in
    excess of �9.000 and that the letter from the respondent did  not  show
    the calculations or the figures  to  justify  the  assertion  that  the
    monies in the account fell below the prescribed figure



Assessment of whether there is an Error of Law

7.   No further evidence has been submitted in support  of  the  appeal.  Mr
    Kotas submitted that the judge had reached a decision properly open  to
    him. The conversion table used by the respondent had been disclosed  to
    the appellant and formed part of the appeal papers.  The OANDA currency
    converter confirmed that on the days identified  in  the  decision  the
    balance in the appellant's account had fallen below �9000.

8.   I am not satisfied that the judge erred in law.  This  is  not  a  case
    where the judge acted  on  unsubstantiated  assertions.  There  was  no
    evidence before him to contradict the  evidence  about  the  conversion
    rate used by the respondent in assessing whether  the  appellant  could
    meet the requirements of the rules. The rate of exchange relied on  and
    the calculations were provided to the appellant who had an  opportunity
    of producing evidence to show that they were inaccurate. He  failed  to
    do so. In these circumstances the judge  reached  a  decision  properly
    open to him for the reasons he gave.

Decision

9.   The First-tier Tribunal did not err in law  and  its  decision  stands.
