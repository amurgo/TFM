Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Walsh, Counsel instructed by Universe Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Gambia born on 7 June 1985 who entered
    the UK in June 2007 with leave as a work permit holder until 31 July
    2007.  Thereafter he remained in the UK unlawfully.

 2. In 2010 he commenced a relationship with his wife, who is a naturalised
    British citizen originally from the Philippines ("the sponsor").

 3. On 7 February 2014 the appellant was convicted of possessing an ID
    document with intent and imprisoned for six months.

 4. The appellant and sponsor married on 15 November 2018.  The sponsor has
    two adult children from a previous relationship.

 5. The appellant applied for leave to remain on the basis of his family
    life in the UK with the sponsor.

 6. The respondent rejected the application. Four reasons were given as to
    why the appellant did not meet the requirements for leave to remain as
    a partner under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules. Firstly, because
    of the criminal offence committed in 2014 the appellant fell for
    refusal on grounds of suitability under paragraph SLTR.1.6 of Appendix
    FM.  Secondly, the Immigration status requirements under ELTRP2.2 were
    not met because he had been in the UK unlawfully since 31 July 2007.
    Thirdly, although the appellant submitted documentary evidence
    indicating that his wife's income exceeded the threshold in paragraph
    ELTRP, not all of the documents required under Appendix FM - SE had
    been provided and consequently the respondent was unable to properly
    assess the sponsor's income. Fourthly, it was not accepted that there
    would be insurmountable obstacles to the relationship continuing
    outside of the UK for the purposes of paragraph EX.1.

 7. The respondent also stated that no evidence had been submitted that
    would establish exceptional circumstances rendering refusal a breach of
    Article 8 because there would be unjustifiably harsh consequences.

 8. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal where his appeal was
    heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Sills ("the judge").  In a
    decision promulgated on 30 July 2019 the judge dismissed the appeal.
    The appellant is now appealing against that decision.

 9. The judge considered whether the appellant could satisfy the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules. He found that the appellant's
    conviction in 2014 was spent and that his conduct, character and
    associations did not make it undesirable for him to be allowed to
    remain in the UK. He therefore concluded that the appellant did not
    fall foul of SLTR.1.6.

10. With respect to the financial eligibility requirements, the judge found
    that although the sponsor earned over the minimum income requirement of
    ï¿½18,600 at the relevant time, some of the specified evidence required
    was not provided.

11. The judge considered whether there would be insurmountable obstacles to
    the appellant's relationship with the sponsor continuing outside the
    UK. He found that there would be no such obstacles in either Gambia or
    the Philippines.

12. Having concluded that the appellant was unable to meet the requirements
    of the Immigration Rules the judge turned to consider the appeal
    outside the Rules.  The judge accepted that the appellant has a family
    life with the sponsor and that, having resided in the UK for over
    twelve years, he has developed a private life as well.  However, he
    found that removal of the appellant would not be disproportionate. In
    respect of the argument that it would be disproportionate to expect the
    appellant to leave the UK solely in order to make an entry clearance
    application, the judge stated at paragraph 19:

         "I do not accept that it would be unreasonable to require the
         Sponsor to either leave the UK with the Appellant, or for the
         couple to separate while the appellant left the UK to apply for
         entry clearance, given that the couple began the relationship when
         the appellant was unlawfully in the UK.  I do not accept that the
         principles from Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40 case apply to the
         Appellant.  The Appellant cannot meet the requirements of the Rules
         from within the UK.  He would not be separated from any British
         child or child with long residence with whom he has a parental
         relationship, and no such child would be required to leave the UK
         with him.  The public interest in requiring individuals to comply
         with the requirements of the Immigration Rules is plain.  As set
         out above, I consider the Sponsor's children, who are both now
         adults, would be able to remain in the UK or move to the
         Philippines with or without the Sponsor and the Appellant without
         facing any significant difficulties and so they are not
         significantly affected by this decision."

13. The grounds of appeal submit that the judge fell into error by failing
    to find, in accordance with the judgment of the House of Lords in
    Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40, that removal would be disproportionate under
    article 8(2) ECHR given that the appellant would be certain to succeed
    in an entry clearance application from outside the UK.

14. Mr Walsh drew attention to paragraph 44 of Chikwamba where it is
    stated:

         "Rather it seems to me that only comparatively rarely, certainly in
         family cases involving children, should an Article 8 appeal be
         dismissed on the basis that it would be proportionate and more
         appropriate for the appellant to apply for leave from abroad."

15. Mr Walsh submitted that the language used in Chikwamba is clear and
    that it was inconsistent with Chikwamba to not allow the appeal. He
    maintained that the judge did not provide any justification as to why
    it would be proportionate for the appellant to be required to leave the
    UK simply to make an application that would inevitably succeed.




16. Chikwamba does not remove the need, in order to succeed under article 8
    on the basis that temporary removal would be disproportionate because a
    grant of entry clearance would be inevitable, for an appellant to
    establish that temporary removal will cause a substantial interference
    with his family life. See R (on the application of Chen) v Secretary of
    State for the Home Department) (Appendix FM - Chikwamba - temporary
    separation - proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC) at [39] and
    [42]. The headnote to Chen explains:




             There may be cases in which there are no insurmountable
             obstacles to family life being enjoyed outside the U.K. but
             where temporary separation to enable an individual to make an
             application for entry clearance may be disproportionate. In
             all cases, it will be for the individual to place before the
             Secretary of State evidence that such temporary separation
             will interfere disproportionately with protected rights. It
             will not be enough to rely solely upon the case-law concerning
             Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40.

17. The appellant has not put forward any evidence, or advanced a case, to
    show that he (or the sponsor) would face hardship or difficulty if
    required to leave the UK temporarily in order to apply for entry
    clearance. There was no evidence of any child who would be affected by
    the appellant's temporary removal; or of any care or other important
    responsibility in the UK that would be negatively impacted. There was
    no evidence that there would be a particularly long wait for the
    application to be dealt with in Gambia or that the appellant would face
    any difficulties finding (or funding) accommodation whilst the
    application is pending.  Nor was there any evidence indicating that the
    appellant's temporary removal would have a negative impact on his (or
    the sponsor's) health. Moreover, the appellant and sponsor would be
    able to choose whether the sponsor would join him in Gambia for some or
    all of the time the application was pending. There was no evidence to
    show that the sponsor would be unable to obtain leave from work for
    this purpose, or that she could not join the appellant during holiday
    periods.

18. As the appellant has not adduced evidence to show that temporary
    separation will interfere with his family life, there was no basis upon
    which the judge could find that his temporary removal would breach
    article 8 ECHR. The judge was therefore entitled to find that temporary
    separation in order to make an application from outside the UK would
    not be disproportionate under article 8 ECHR even if such an
    application would be certain to succeed.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed.
