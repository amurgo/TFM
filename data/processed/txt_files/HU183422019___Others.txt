                            DECISION AND REASONS

BACKGROUND

1. By a decision dated 20 January 2021, Upper Tribunal Judge Lindsley found
   an error of law in the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Suffield-
   Thompson itself promulgated on 2 January 2020.  Judge Suffield-Thompson
   dismissed the Appellants' appeals on human rights grounds against the
   Respondent's decision dated 25 October 2019 rejecting their human rights
   claims.  Having found an error of law, Judge Lindsley set aside the First-
   tier Tribunal's decision and gave directions for a resumed hearing. Judge
   Lindsley's error of law decision is appended to this decision for ease of
   reference.

2. The Appellants are all nationals of Bangladesh. The First Appellant is
   the wife of the Second Appellant and mother of the Third Appellant. The
   family's immigration history is adequately set out at [1] and [2] of the
   error of law decision and I do not repeat what is there said.

3. By her error of law decision, Judge Lindsley preserved various findings
   made by Judge Suffield-Thompson which are set out at [15] of her decision
   as follows:

      "The appeal is dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal on the basis that
      the appellants' removal is proportionate because: the appellants had
      taken insufficient steps to clear the first appellant's name so it was
      not believed that they had remained in the UK for this purpose; they
      had not returned to Bangladesh and re-entered with entry clearance as
      they could have done if the first appellant truly wished to complete
      her studies in the UK so it was not believed that she really intended
      to do this; it was not credible that the appellants were supported by
      family and friends as there was no documentary evidence of this; it
      was in the best interests of the third appellant to be brought up in
      Bangladesh where the first and second appellants would be in
      professional jobs with wider family support; if the appellants
      returned to Bangladesh they will have family, good work opportunities
      and would not face hardship; and there was no evidence that they were
      integrated in the UK or working here."

4. The reason Judge Lindsley found an error of law in the First-tier
   Tribunal's decision arose from events occurring in 2014.  It is said by
   the Appellants that, at that point in time, the Respondent alleged that
   the First Appellant had cheated when taking a TOEIC (Test of English for
   International Communication) test as she had used a proxy test-taker.  It
   is said that, as a result of the Respondent making that allegation, the
   First Appellant was unable to pursue her studies as the allegation is
   said to have been made to the college which subsequently withdrew its
   sponsorship. This case therefore has some links with the so-called ETS
   (Educational Testing Services) litigation. The Respondent denied making
   such an allegation.  It is now common ground that no such allegation was
   made to the First Appellant herself and, unlike in other ETS cases, the
   Respondent did not directly curtail the First Appellant's leave based on
   the allegation of cheating.

5. Judge Lindsley found, in short summary, that "there was no consideration
   by the First-tier Tribunal of the contention of injustice by the
   respondent by having made a false allegation of cheating to LSBF [London
   School of Business and Finance - the college] which led inexorably to
   [the First Appellant] losing her sponsorship, her leave to remain and
   ability to study in the UK, and the contention that there was a duty
   ....to put the appellant in the same position she would have been if the
   false allegation had not been made to the first appellant's college."
   ([13] of the error of law decision).

6. Judge Lindsley directed that the resumed hearing should take place by
   remote means.  Neither party objected to that course.  She directed that
   it would take place based on submissions only and that "[t]he parties
   will both use their best endeavours to obtain copies of the
   correspondence sent by the respondent to the LSBF in 2014 which led LSBF
   to write in their e-mail of 23rd December 2014 that the Home Office had
   stated that the first appellant had used a proxy test taker to take her
   English test."  She also directed that any further documentary evidence
   should be filed and served ten days prior to the resumed hearing.

7. An additional bundle was filed by the Appellants on 22 April 2021.
   Although that is not ten days prior to the hearing, I admitted that
   evidence without objection by Ms Cunha.  No further evidence was filed by
   the Respondent.  I refer to documents in the Appellants' additional
   bundle below as [ABS/xx].  I also have the Appellants' bundle before the
   First-tier Tribunal (referred to below as [AB/xx]), a core bundle of
   documents including the Respondent's bundle (referred to below as
   [RB/xx]) and the Appellants' skeleton argument and chronology before the
   First-tier Tribunal.

8. Although there were some minor sound problems with Ms Cunha's
   connection, those did not affect my ability to follow her submissions.
   Other than those minor difficulties, there were no technical difficulties
   affecting the conduct of the hearing.

THE ISSUES

9. Judge Lindsley having preserved findings made by the First-tier
   Tribunal, and as Mr � Ceallaigh confirmed, there are only two issues
   which I have to decide.  The first is, as a matter of fact, what occurred
   in 2014.  The second is what impact those events have on the Appellants'
   immigration position and human rights claim.  Mr � Ceallaigh confirmed
   that the Appellants' case is restricted to the impact of the allegation
   on the public interest in the maintenance of immigration control.  He
   fairly accepted that, but for that point, the Appellants would not
   succeed in their appeal.  That is the case in light of the factual
   findings preserved by Judge Lindsley as set out above.

DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

10. I begin by dealing with Mr � Ceallaigh's submission regarding the
   Respondent's change of position.  He pointed out that Mr Lindsay said at
   the previous hearing that no ETS allegation had been made against the
   First Appellant whereas Ms Cunha now accepted, following the LSBF
   disclosure, that it was alleged that the First Appellant had a
   "questionable" result in a TOEIC test.  I was not entirely clear whether
   Mr � Ceallaigh went so far as to allege that the Respondent had misled
   the Tribunal or acted in bad faith in this regard.  If he did, I reject
   the submission.

11. As I will come to below, the allegation made appeared in a list
   provided to LSBF of students whose TOEIC results were said to be
   "questionable" or "invalid" by the Home Office, following information
   from ETS.  It was not an allegation made directly to the First Appellant
   (as is common ground).  It is also common ground that the curtailment of
   the First Appellant's leave flowed directly from the withdrawal of the
   college sponsorship albeit indirectly that arose following the provision
   of the list of TOEIC results which list contained the allegation relied
   upon by the college.  As such, it is unlikely that the allegation will
   have appeared on the First Appellant's Home Office file or notes in
   relation to her.  It is understandable therefore that the Respondent has
   asserted and continues to assert that she has never directly relied on
   such an allegation.

12. As I come to below, the allegation appears to have been made in the
   context of a review of the position of a number of students registered
   with LSBF.  I accept therefore that Mr Lindsay, at the previous hearing,
   may well have been entirely unaware of what occurred.  I will however
   need to say something regarding a document which was before Judge
   Lindsley concerning the compromise of a judicial review involving the
   First Appellant which might suggest that an allegation of some sort was
   made against her.  I accept however that there was no intention by the
   Respondent deliberately to mislead the Tribunal in this regard.

13. In order to consider what occurred in 2014, it is necessary to have
   regard to the Appellants' additional bundle in some detail.

14. The First Appellant has submitted an additional witness statement dated
   22 April 2021 ([ABS/4-5]). That witness statement contains substantially
   more information about what occurred in 2014/2015.  Her first statement
   as before the First-tier Tribunal, in this regard said only that her
   sponsorship had been withdrawn in December 2014 because the Home Office
   had informed LSBF that she had used a proxy test taker when taking her
   English language test and had acted unreasonably and unfairly by
   curtailing her leave (see �3 of the statement at [AB/4]).  She said that
   she did not use a TOEIC certificate in any application and that the
   "[c]ollege authority maintain that as they have been informed by the Home
   Office, therefore, I should short [sic] out this issue with the Home
   Office" ([�4]). She did not mention the steps taken by LSBF prior to the
   withdrawal of sponsorship nor by the Respondent when curtailing her
   leave.

15. The First Appellant's additional witness statement contains the
   following relevant information:

   a) The First Appellant enrolled with LSBF to complete a CIMA (Chartered
      Institute of Management Accountants) degree in January 2014.  The
      course was due to last until 24 November 2016. There is a letter dated
      8 December 2014 from LSBF ([ABS/15]) confirming that the First
      Appellant attended 89 classes out of a possible 96 and had an
      attendance rate of 93%.  That letter post-dates the intervention of
      the college in relation to the First Appellant's sponsorship (see
      below).

   b) The First Appellant did not ever take an English language test with
      TOEIC.  The allegation that she cheated in such a test could not
      therefore be factually accurate.  She took a test via City and Guilds.
       She does however accept that she registered for a TOEIC test.

   c) The result of the test which the First Appellant is said by the
      college to have sat with TOEIC is "questionable" not "invalid" (see
      what is said below).

   d) The First Appellant was asked by her college to take a "PTE test"
      (Pearson Test in English).  She sat that test but because it was
      unfamiliar to her, she says, she failed it. Although Mr � Ceallaigh
      suggested at one point in his submissions that the PTE test was
      "harder" than the City and Guilds test, he fairly accepted that there
      was no evidence to support that submission but he asserted that the
      test was "different" and that the First Appellant was also under
      pressure when taking that test due to the circumstances at that time
      (see below).  The First Appellant says that she was unprepared and
      that she was "mentally upset and broke down".

   e) The First Appellant failed the test and her appeal against the
      withdrawal of her sponsorship was also dismissed.  She says that she
      tried to enrol with other colleges but could not do so because of the
      ETS allegation.  She says that such contact was made by telephone.
      There is scant documentary evidence in this regard.

16. I turn then to the evidence which emanates from LSBF.  Although it is
   not entirely clear from the additional bundle why LSBF was told about the
   First Appellant's asserted "questionable" result, some evidence appears
   in this regard at [RB/A25] in a letter dated 26 March 2015 from the Home
   Office to the First Appellant's previous solicitors.  That reads as
   follows so far as relevant:

      "ETS have provided the Home Office with the details of 56,000 ETS
      certificates that they have withdrawn.  We shared information with
      LSBF of the details of this action as it related to their student body
      and asked them to investigate that their students were abiding with
      the immigration rules.

      The sponsor guidance imposes various duties on sponsors in order to
      ensure that immigration control is maintained.  If a college concludes
      that any students that it sponsors have obtained their leave or
      sponsorship by deception, it has a duty to take appropriate action, in
      line with the sponsor guidance and its internal policies governing the
      sponsorship of international students.  In your client's case it
      appears that, following investigation LSBF concluded that the
      appropriate course of action was withdrawal of sponsorship.  Again,
      UKVI were not involved in that decision making process (except to the
      extent outlined above), and accordingly this decision is not one on
      which we are in a position to comment further.

      If your client have concerns about the manner in which LSBF's
      investigation was conducted, or disagree with the conclusions reached
      or actions taken, this is a matter to be taken up with LSBF."

17. As appears from the LSBF documents, the college was sent a list not
   only of those students whose ETS results were either questionable or
   invalid but also students who were working beyond the hours that they
   were entitled to work ([ABS/20]).  As such, the motive behind the
   provision of the lists appears to have been to inform LSBF of students
   who were failing to comply, on the evidence the Home Office had, with the
   terms of their sponsorship and leave in order that LSBF could fulfil its
   own duties under the sponsor licence requirements.  As such, I accept Ms
   Cunha's submission that the Home Office was bound to provide the evidence
   to LSBF.

18. According to LSBF, they were requested to withdraw the students on the
   list "accordingly" ([ABS/20]).  That is somewhat at odds with what is
   said by the Home Office.  There is no disclosure of any correspondence
   between the college and the Home Office, but I am prepared to accept that
   the Home Office is likely to have told the college to withdraw
   sponsorship to any student found to be in breach of the immigration rules
   ("the Rules") and the conditions of their leave.

19. As I canvassed with Mr � Ceallaigh in the course of his submissions,
   there may be a debate however as to what the college was asked to do or
   should have done in relation to the First Appellant as her TOEIC result
   is said to have been only "questionable" and not "invalid".  Mr �
   Ceallaigh confirmed my understanding that there was at some point a
   different process for those whose results were only "questionable".  Mr �
   Ceallaigh pointed out that on current Home Office instructions, the First
   Appellant would not have had her leave curtailed based on the ETS
   allegation in any event as she had not relied on it in an application.
   Be that as it may, I have no evidence as to the process at the relevant
   time. I am prepared to assume for present purposes that the college was
   instructed to take the same action against students in the "questionable"
   category as in the "invalid" category.

20. There is some anomaly in the evidence from LSBF as to what the college
   was otherwise told about the TOEIC result.  It is very clearly stated in
   an email dated 2 March 2021 ([ABS/6]) that LSBF was not given the exam
   result.  This point is dealt with in more detail in a letter dated 11
   February 2021 ([ABS/21]) as follows:

      "This student was identified to us as having a proxy test taker for
      their proof of English.  Although the lists were provided, no evidence
      was shared with LSBF to substantiate claims whether any wrongdoing had
      taken place.  Students were categorised further into two categories;
      their test was "Invalid" or it was "Questionable", your client fell
      under the Questionable category".

      [my emphasis]

21. However, as I will come to below, when dealing with its own process, in
   some of the correspondence, LSBF has asserted that the First Appellant's
   PTE scores were inconsistent with her TOEIC result.  That cannot be the
   position if LSBF had no information about those scores.  Mr � Ceallaigh
   accepted when asked about this that what was meant was that the First
   Appellant's PTE scores did not reach the level of B2 which was the level
   shown in her City and Guilds certificate and would be the requisite level
   for a TOEIC qualification.

22. That submission is supported by what is said in the letter at [ABS/21]
   as follows:

      "We expected the results from the PTE test to be similar to the level
      of the TOEIC as they are both English tests and your client had
      already achieved a B2 in her City and Guilds qualification".

   That sentence makes clear that the college was well aware that the First
   Appellant had relied on a City and Guilds qualification when applying for
   her course and that what the college was looking for was a PTE result
   consistent with a B2 qualification.

23. Notwithstanding LSBF's understanding that the college had been asked to
   withdraw sponsorship from the students on the lists, the letter at
   [ABS/21] goes on to explain events after the sending of the lists as
   follows:

      "LSBF made the decision not to directly withdraw all students,
      regardless of their category and instead a process was implemented
      where we would interview all students identified.  The outcomes would
      be; a free PTE test, expel the student, confirm that they have already
      been expelled or offer them a second interview."

24. As Ms Cunha submitted and I accept, this suggests a two-stage process -
   an interview followed by a range of outcomes not all of which involve
   expulsion. In the First Appellant's case, the letter at [ABS/21] goes on
   to explain that the First Appellant attended the interview on 3 October
   2014.  After the interview, a decision was made to offer her a free PTE
   test to prove that she had "actually performed the English test herself,
   not by the use of a proxy".

25. The results of the PTE test taken on 5 November 2014 appear at
   [ABS/30].  Those show the following scores:

   Listening: 37

   Reading: 39

   Speaking: 32

   Writing: 40

   Grammar: 10

   Oral fluency: 35

   Pronunciation: 25

   Spelling: 20

   Vocabulary: 10

   Written Discourse: 10

   The overall score was 36. That does not reach the requisite score.

26. Ms Cunha drew my attention to an e-mail sent apparently by the First
   Appellant (although from the Second Appellant's address) dated 6 November
   2014 ([ABS/29]).  This was in connection, it appears, with a request from
   the Tier 4 compliance team at LSBF asking for the PTE scores to be
   uploaded onto the system.  The email reads as follows:

      "hey you suggest me to get the PTE exam i done the exam as well please
      remind you i did not get toice b2.  I extend my visa by city & guild.
      i did not even get b2 and it was my first time visa extension. i have
      no idea why you gays call me for PTE exam.. i attach my city & guild
      certificate".

27. I of course appreciate that English is not the First Appellant's first
   language.  I also accept that communications by e-mail are sometimes
   written in a hurry and not checked.  However, the grammatical,
   punctuation and spelling errors in a communication from a student to her
   college where one might expect a degree of professionalism tend to
   support the scores in the PTE test.

28. Following that email, on 12 November 2014, the college wrote to the
   First Appellant as follows ([ABS/27]):

      "We explained in our previous communication that it is very important
      that you attend the exam as scheduled.  We also stated that we will be
      relying on the results of the exam, together with our assessment of
      the representations you made during the interview in order to make out
      decision whether or not to continue your Tier 4 sponsorship.

      Five working days has now passed since you sat the examination.  You
      are now requested to take two additional steps.

     1. You are now required to assign your test results to 'London School
        of Business and Finance'. This can be done by following the steps
        outlined below this email.

     2. Additionally you are also required to submit your PTE transcript to
        us via the email address: HTSLicenceinterview@lsbf.org.uk.

      You must complete both steps before 17/11/2014.  Accordingly, if you
      fail to assign your results to us, or submit the transcript to us, we
      will proceed to make a decision on your continued sponsorship based on
      information available to us.  Both steps will be verified following
      these steps.

      It is important you understand that at present, based on the
      information provided by UKVI and on the balance of probabilities, we
      are minded to withdraw your sponsorship and expel you from your course
      of study.  However, we will evaluate your PTE exam performance and the
      representations you made during your interview holistically before we
      make our final decision.  It is in your best interest, therefore, to
      assign your scores to 'London School of Business and Finance' and
      email in your PTE transcript."

29. The reference to the college being "minded to withdraw" the First
   Appellant's sponsorship based on the information provided by the
   Respondent is potentially supportive of the Appellants' case that the
   college considered itself bound to withdraw sponsorship and had already
   made up its mind.  Equally, however, the reference to considering the PTE
   test results and representations made in interview are potentially
   supportive of the Respondent's case that the college was following its
   own process and reaching its own decision.

30. The competing submissions in this regard have to be considered in the
   context of all the evidence from LSBF.  The evidence which is relevant to
   this point is as follows:

   Email dated 25 November 2014 from LSBF to the First Appellant [ABS/28]

      "We have written to you on 30/08/2014 telling you that your student
      record has been identified by UKVI, who informed us that you have
      obtained a TOEIC certificate which was Questionable by Educational
      Testing Services ("ETS").  As you are aware, our agreement to sponsor
      you as an International Student in the UK was evidenced by our
      acceptance to issue you with a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies
      ("CAS").  Our CAS document was issued conditionally (and remains
      conditional) based upon our assessment of your academic profile and
      abilities as evidenced by the documents that you submitted to us at
      the time of application.  If any of the documents submitted prove to
      be inaccurate or misleading, or in cases where you have failed to
      disclose material information about your academic background and
      qualifications, we reserve our right to withdraw our sponsorship
      without notice and to notify UKVI of the same.

      You were invited to attend the interview as a condition of your
      continued sponsorship. We explained that your continued sponsorship
      would be assessed based on the results of the interview and the
      results of an additional Secure English Language Test ("SELT") - the
      Pearson Test of English ("PTE") - which we invited you to sit at our
      cost.

      Following your PTE you were asked to assign your PTE test scores to
      London School of Business and Finance and send in your PTE certificate
      to HTSLicenceinterview@lsbf.org.uk by 17/11/2014.  Because of a
      failure to follow these clear steps we have subsequently decided to
      withdraw sponsorship and expel you from your course of study.

      We have reached this decision on the balance of probabilities, based
      on information available to us from UKVI, your representations during
      the interview, and the results of your PTE exam.

      Accordingly, we are not satisfied we should prefer your evidence that
      your TOEIC exam certificate should be considered valid to the
      information supplied by UKVI and ETS, the organisation who
      administrates the TOEIC exam.  We conclude, therefore, that
      information and documents you have provided to us at the time of
      application were misleading."

      Further Comments/ Decision

      Your PTE exam results are inconsistent with the level of English
      proficiency that we would expect based on your previous TOEIC exam
      results and the natural improvement that we would expect from a
      student attending a course in the UK for the duration that you have
      been attending.  Therefore, the original decision is upheld."

   Letter dated 9 December 2014 communicating appeal outcome [ABS/32]

      "... Having considered your appeal, we are satisfied that the decision
      to withdraw sponsorship was correct, for the following reasons:

      Your PTE exam results are inconsistent with the level of English
      proficiency that we would expect based on your previous TOEIC exam
      results and the natural improvement that we would expect from a
      student attending a course in the UK for the duration that you have
      been attending.  Therefore, the original decision is upheld.

      Accordingly, we confirm our decision to withdraw your Tier 4
      sponsorship.  UKVI are informed of our decision, which means your
      leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 4 student has been curtailed...."

31. The above sequence of events is summarised in the letter dated 11
   February 2021 from LSBF at [ABS/20-21] to which I have already referred
   in the following terms:

      "Your client attended the interview on 3rd October 2014 at 12am.
      Following that interview, a decision was made to offer her a free PTE
      test.  This test would essentially prove that the student had actually
      performed the English test herself, not by the use of a proxy."

      [LSBF then makes the point about the levels of the respective tests
      which I have cited at [22] above]

      Your client took the PTE test on 5th November 2014 which LSBF paid
      for.  The student was then requested to assign their PTE scores to
      LSBF, the standard procedure so LSBF could verify the test at the time
      as stipulated in the attached email dated 12 November 2014.  The email
      included steps as to how the PTE scores could be assigned.

      However, the student did not assign their scores to LSBF within the
      stipulated period and the decision was taken to withdraw sponsorship
      and expel your client from their course of study which was
      communicated to your client on 25 November 2014...It was explained
      that this decision was based on information available to us from UKVI,
      your client's representations during the interview, and the results of
      your client's PTE exam.

      Despite the above decision and your client's own inaction, your client
      was given a further opportunity to appeal the same.  The student's
      appeal application was successful, and she attended the appeal hearing
      on 5th December 2014 at 5:20pm.  Your client also brought with her the
      PTE test results as evidence to the appeal.  The PTE test score showed
      that your client had achieved a score of 36 which was below the
      requirements...In accordance with B2 Study Visa requirements, your
      client should have achieved a score of 59 for the PTE test.
      Accordingly, LSBF made the decision to expel the student and withdraw
      sponsorship.  A letter was sent to your client on 9th December 2014
      informing her of the decision and that the original decision was to be
      upheld..

      Although the Home Office had directed us to remove the student, LSBF
      went over and above to grant Mrs Islam several opportunities to rebut
      the claims of the Home Office.  We did not take the approach of many
      other providers and just withdraw everyone.  We implemented a strict
      and fair process to screen all alleged students despite our obligation
      to strictly act upon the Home Office's advice...

      Considering the above, please note that any claim initiated by your
      client will be defended robustly..."

32. Finally, LSBF's position is reiterated in an email dated 2 March 2021
   ([ABS/6]).  Having again confirmed that LSBF was not provided with the
   TOEIC score as I have already noted, the email continues as follows:

      "... Secondly, the proficiency of your client's English ability is not
      the determining factor in this matter.  The fact remains that LSBF
      were informed by the Home Office that your client had a 'questionable'
      TOEIC English assessment and regardless of your client's English
      ability, as sponsors LSBF were duty bound to act upon this
      information.

      The PTE is a recognised English assessment and accepted by the UKVI.
      It is reasonable to assume the PTE scores achieved by your client
      would have been at a B2 level, which was the level required to study
      the course.  Your client's PTE scores fell below the requisite
      standard.  As demonstrated in our letter dated 11 February 2012, LSBF
      did not take the route of other providers and blindly withdraw
      students.  Instead, an independent investigation was conducted
      following which your client's sponsorship was withdrawn...."

33. In relation to the action taken by the Respondent, the letter
   confirming the curtailment of the First Appellant's leave is dated 7
   April 2015.  It appears at [AB/29] and reads as follows (so far as
   relevant):

"You were granted leave to remain as a Tier 4 General Student until 24
March 2017 in order to undertake a course of study at London School of
Business and Finance.

However, the Home Office was informed by the London School of Business and
Finance on 23 December 2014 that you ceased studying with them.

Home Office records have been checked and there is no evidence that you
have made an application to change your sponsor or made a fresh application
for entry clearance, leave to enter or leave to remain in the United
Kingdom in any capacity.

Therefore, as you have been excluded or withdrawn from your course of
studies, as notified by your Tier 4 sponsor, your leave is curtailed under
paragraph 323A(a)(ii)(2) of the Immigration Rules until 09 June 2015."

34. The First Appellant was therefore given a period of sixty days to find
   another sponsor.  As I have already noted, she says that she was unable
   to find another sponsor due to the ETS allegation but has provided scant
   documentary evidence confirming her enquiries (which she says were made
   by phone only).  There is however evidence in the initial appeal bundle
   at [AB/14-16] that the Appellant tried to obtain sponsorship via Boost
   Education Service when given the sixty days' leave.  She says however
   that she would have been required to sign a TOEIC declaration which
   appears at [AB/17].  I do not understand her case in that regard since
   she says that she never sat a TOEIC case (even though she had registered
   for it).  It is not clear to me why she would have been unable to sign
   the declaration.

35. Be that as it may, immediately prior to the expiry of the sixty days,
   the First Appellant made an application with the Second Appellant as her
   dependent based on their Article 8 rights.  The human rights claim was
   refused by the Respondent and certified as clearly unfounded.  The
   Appellants did not seek to challenge by way of judicial review either the
   curtailment decision or the certification decision.

36. The Appellants did however bring a judicial review challenge in August
   2019.  It appears from the Appellants' chronology that, having made a
   series of unsuccessful applications, on 16 April 2019, the Appellants
   made further representations. Those appear at [RB/A1-19]. They were
   refused on 15 May 2019.  The refusal letter appears at [RB/B1].  The
   further representations included a denial by the First Appellant of the
   allegation that she had cheated in her English language test and are put
   forward on the basis that, as an individual impacted by the ETS
   litigation, having made a human rights claim in the representations, and
   following the Court of Appeal's judgment in Khan and others v Secretary
   of State for the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 1684, the First
   Appellant should be given a right of appeal.  Although the Respondent
   rejected those representations, she agreed to reconsider following a
   judicial review challenge.

37. Unfortunately, the judicial review application is not in any of the
   bundles.  However, presumably because this was presented as an ETS case,
   the judicial review was compromised by a consent order sealed by the
   Tribunal on 9 September 2015 ([AB/26-27]).  That consent order contains
   the following recital:

      "AND UPON the Respondent agreeing that if the Appellant succeeds in
      any appeal, on the basis that she did not commit a TOEIC fraud then,
      in the absence of some new factor justifying a different course, the
      Respondent will rescind her decision of 7 April 2015 to curtail her
      Tier 4 leave and:

        i) Treat the Applicant as being an in time applicant since 7 April
           2015 (and any earlier period as may be established) as if she
           had 3C leave, subject to there being no other periods where the
           Applicant was an overstayer.

       ii) Grant the Applicant a reasonable opportunity, being not less
           than 60 days, to submit an application for further leave;

      iii) Waive any fee or charge (including health surcharge) that might
           be payable for making such an application."

38. It is the reconsideration of the 15 May 2019 refusal which led to the
   Respondent's decision dated 25 October 2019 which is here under appeal.
   The decision letter appears in the Respondent's bundle.  As the
   Respondent points out at [34] of that letter "the Home Office has never
   refused any previous application or claim on the basis of suitability and
   has never regarded you as being a person who has attempted to obtain
   leave by deception" (in other words there was and never has been any
   direct allegation of deception).  The letter goes on to rehearse in
   summary the course of events with which I have already dealt.  The letter
   also points out that the First Appellant had already been accorded a
   period of sixty days to find another sponsor after LSBF's withdrawal of
   sponsorship.

39. As appears from the foregoing, it appears that the Respondent
   mistakenly agreed to a consent order which does not reflect the factual
   basis of this case.  I do not consider that the consent order has an
   impact in this case for three reasons.  First, although there is no
   finding of deception in this appeal (and nor is the Tribunal asked to
   consider that issue), there is no finding to the contrary.  In other
   words, that is not an issue in this appeal save insofar as it impacts on
   actions taken in the past.  I did not understand Mr � Ceallaigh to
   suggest that, because the First-tier Tribunal Judge had not made a
   finding of deception, the Appellants were entitled to succeed in their
   appeal.

40. Second, as I have already pointed out, the Respondent had already given
   a sixty days' period following the withdrawal of sponsorship to find
   another sponsor. The Respondent had therefore already provided at least
   part of the remedy contained in the recital.

41. Third, the recital makes clear that the agreement as to what would
   occur depended on there being no "new factor".  Whilst it might be said
   that the mistaken assumption that this was a standard ETS case in which
   the Tribunal would be asked to determine whether the First Appellant had
   in fact exercised deception is not new, the consent order envisages that
   course being followed in this appeal.  That is not what happened because,
   as I have already pointed out, the allegation was not relied upon by the
   Respondent in the decision under appeal.

42. That then is the relevant factual background to the Appellants' case.
   Mr � Ceallaigh submitted that this factual background made a difference
   to the Appellants' case by way of diminution of the public interest for
   the following reasons:

   1) The LSBF process was flawed.  The first point made is that PTE was a
      different test.  He submitted that LSBF assumed that if the First
      Appellant did not meet the standard required by that test, then she
      would be treated as having behaved fraudulently. The First Appellant's
      evidence is that she was under pressure and unprepared and that is why
      she performed badly.  Thereafter, the Respondent had merely relied on
      LSBF's assessment and therefore the allegation of fraud as fact.

   2) LSBF failed to have regard to the City and Guilds certificate when
      assessing the case.  The conclusions were based on the TOEIC result.

   3) Although LSBF had given the First Appellant a "minded to" indication,
      it is clear from the correspondence that LSBF considered itself bound
      to withdraw sponsorship from the First Appellant.  The college was
      therefore under pressure to remove her.

43. In short, therefore, the Appellant's case is that the intervening
   procedure carried out by LSBF was unfair and does not absolve the
   Respondent from its responsibility in relation to the withdrawal of the
   First Appellant's sponsorship which led directly to the curtailment of
   her leave.  Had it not been for the Respondent including the First
   Appellant's name in the list to LSBF, she would have continued to study
   successfully, would have been entitled to remain in the UK and would by
   now have qualified for settlement.

44. Mr � Ceallaigh drew my attention in particular to what is said at [64]
   of the decision in R (oaa Mohibullah) v Secretary of State for the Home
   Department (TOEIC - ETS - judicial review principles) [2016] UKUT 00561
   (IAC) ("Mohibullah") as follows:

      "From Mr Armstrong's quiver next emerged the submission that the
      Tribunal should apply the prism of conspicuous unfairness to the
      decision making route selected by the Secretary of State. The factual
      ingredients in this discrete argument are that this is the only known
      case to date in which this curtailment of leave provision in Rule 323A
      has been deployed by the Secretary of State (which is not contested);
      the conditions under which resort to this decision making power became
      possible were orchestrated by the dubious conduct of the Secretary of
      State's agents in exercising improper pressure on the college to
      withdraw the Applicant from his course; and the Applicant has been
      treated differently than other suspected TOEIC fraudsters, without
      adequate explanation or good reason. The other key ingredient in this
      equation is, of course, that each of the other two possible decision
      making routes generated a statutory right of appeal."

      [emphasis based on submission]

45. The decision in Mohibullah is said to be of significance because, as in
   this case, the decision to curtail leave was premised on the college's
   withdrawal of sponsorship (see [5] of the decision).    There are however
   a number of reasons why I do not consider that the decision is of
   assistance.  First, unlike in this case, the college in Mohibullah had
   simply withdrawn sponsorship without apparently giving the applicant in
   that case any opportunity to deal with the allegation ([11]).  Second,
   the applicant in Mohibullah was not given an opportunity to find an
   alternative sponsor (in other words a sixty day' period) as was the First
   Appellant.

46. Third, the submission regarding the "improper pressure" has to be read
   in the context of the facts and evidence set out at [12] to [31] of the
   decision.  The requirement to withdraw sponsorship from the students in
   that case was in the context of a decision to suspend the college's
   licence if the college did not take action.  Although I indicated in the
   course of the hearing that the communication from the Home Office to LSBF
   in this case might also have been taken in that context, I had not been
   shown the letter from the Home Office to the Appellants' previous
   solicitors regarding the communication to LSBF which appears in the
   Respondent's bundle as referred to at [16] above and which is not
   consistent with that assumption.

47. Fourth, the Tribunal's consideration of the course of action followed
   by the Respondent in that case also has to be considered in what the
   Tribunal described as "the crucial importance of context".  Mohibullah
   was a judicial review challenge.  Had the Respondent made the decision in
   another way, the applicant in that case would have been given a right of
   appeal ([70]).  It was the deprivation of the right of appeal coupled
   with the pressure put upon the college in relation to its licence which
   the Tribunal concluded gave rise to the "conspicuous unfairness" in that
   case ([73]).  Here, the First Appellant has been given a right of appeal.
    She has had the opportunity to put her side of the story both in the
   context of the process followed by LSBF and in the appeal.

48. Finally, the submission to which Mr � Ceallaigh alluded is of course
   just that. It was a submission made by the applicant's barrister.  It
   appears in a section headed "Conspicuous Unfairness" at [64] onwards.
   What is there said has to be considered in the light of later case-law to
   which I now turn.

49. I begin with the case of Patel (historic injustice; NIAA Part 5A)
   [2020] UKUT 00351 (IAC) ("Patel") to which Ms Cunha referred but did not
   take me.

50. The guidance in Patel reads as follows:

      "A. Historic injustice

      (1) For the future, the expression "historic injustice", as used in
      the immigration context, should be reserved for cases such as those
      concerning certain British Overseas citizens or families of Gurkha ex-
      servicemen, which involve a belated recognition by the United Kingdom
      government that a particular class of persons was wrongly treated, in
      immigration terms, in the past; and that this injustice should be
      recognised in dealing with applications made now (eg Patel and Others
      v Entry Clearance Officer (Mumbai) [2010] EWCA Civ 17; AP (India) v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 89).

      (2) The fact that the injustice exists will be uncontroversial. It
      will be generally recognised. It will apply to a particular class of
      persons. Unlike cases of what might be described as "historical
      injustice", the operation of historic injustice will not depend on the
      particular interaction between the individual member of the class and
      the Secretary of State. The effects of historic injustice on the
      immigration position of the individual are likely to be profound, even
      determinative of success, provided that there is nothing materially
      adverse in their immigration history.

      B. Historical injustice

      (3) Cases that may be described as involving "historical injustice"
      are where the individual has suffered as a result of the wrongful
      operation (or non-operation) by the Secretary of State of her
      immigration functions. Examples are where the Secretary of State has
      failed to give an individual the benefit of a relevant immigration
      policy (eg AA (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State for the Home
      Department [2007] EWCA Civ 12); where delay in reaching decisions is
      the result of a dysfunctional system (eg EB (Kosovo) v Secretary of
      State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 41); or where the Secretary
      of State forms a view about an individual's activities or behaviour,
      which leads to an adverse immigration decision; but where her view
      turns out to be mistaken (eg Ahsan v Secretary of State for the Home
      Department [2017] EWCA Civ 2009). Each of these failings may have an
      effect on an individual's Article 8 ECHR case; but the ways in which
      this may happen differ from the true "historic injustice" category.

      C. Part 5A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and the
      weight to be given to the maintenance of effective immigration
      controls

      (4) In all cases where, for whatever reason, the public interest in
      the maintenance of effective immigration controls falls to be given
      less than its ordinary weight, the usual course should be for the
      judge so to find in terms, when addressing section 117B(1) of the 2002
      Act. The same result may be achieved, at least in some situations, by
      qualifying the consideration in section 117B(4) that little weight
      should be given to a private life formed when the person concerned is
      in the United Kingdom unlawfully. Judicial fact-finders should,
      however, avoid any recourse to double-counting, whereby not only is
      the weight to be given to effective immigration controls diminished
      but also, for the same reason, a private life is given more weight
      than would otherwise be possible by the undiluted application of
      section 117B(4).

      (5) The weight to be given to the public interest in the maintenance
      of effective immigration controls is unlikely to be reduced because of
      disappointments or inadequacies encountered by individuals from
      teaching institutions or employers."

51. As is evident from the foregoing, the First Appellant's case falls, if
   at all, under the heading of historical injustice.  The examples given by
   the Tribunal in Patel of historical injustice involve cases where ETS
   allegations had been made directly in an immigration decision which was
   under challenge (by reference to the case of Ahsan v Secretary of State
   for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 2009 cited at [46] of the
   decision in Patel).  The category into which that case is said to fall is
   where the Respondent has made a decision which turns out to be mistaken.
   In other words, if, in this case, the Respondent had alleged that the
   First Appellant had cheated in her ETS test, but she was found not to
   have done so, that might well be a case of historical injustice.  That is
   the sort of case which would lead to the outcomes set out in the consent
   order to which I have referred at [37] above.  In this case, however, as
   I have pointed out, there is no mistaken decision made by the Respondent.
    Although the First Appellant says that she did not take the ETS test, it
   is confirmed by LSBF that her name appeared on a list of those with
   "questionable" test results.  Although I accept that I do not have direct
   evidence that the Respondent was informed of that test result by ETS, the
   evidence from LSBF is that the First Appellant's name was on the list
   provided and the First Appellant does not deny that she booked such a
   test even if she says that she did not take it.

52. The way in which the argument was developed before me by Mr � Ceallaigh
   is that, but for the Respondent's actions, LSBF would not have withdrawn
   sponsorship.  In other words, LSBF's actions did not break the chain of
   causation.  It is asserted that, but for the Respondent's actions, the
   First Appellant would have successfully continued with her studies and
   would have completed a term of ten years' lawful residence in the UK
   (based as I understand it on the Second Appellant's length of residence).
    I reject that submission for the following reasons.

53. First, as I have already pointed out, all that the Respondent did was
   to inform the college of the information given to her by ETS.  Even if it
   is the case that the Respondent told the college to withdraw sponsorship
   to individuals on those lists, the Respondent was entitled, indeed
   probably duty bound, to bring to the college's attention instances of
   students who were said in some way to be breaching the Rules.  As I have
   pointed out, LSBF was given details not only of those with an ETS
   allegation against them, but also those said to have been working in
   breach of conditions.  I do not of course suggest that the First
   Appellant fell within that second category, but this shows that the ETS
   allegation made by the provision of the information was part of a more
   general exercise to alert the college to those who may be in breach of
   the Rules.

54. Second, insofar as the Appellants rely on the "dubious process" adopted
   by the Respondent in achieving a curtailment of leave indirectly in
   reliance on what was said in Mohibullah, I have explained why that was a
   very different case.  Observations made by the Tribunal in that factually
   distinct case also have to be read in the light of developments in the
   case law regarding "conspicuous unfairness".  Although I did not receive
   legal argument on this issue, it is appropriate to have regard to what
   was said by the Supreme Court in R (oao Gallaher Group Ltd and others) v
   Competition and Markets Authority [2018] UKSC 25 at [34] to  [41] of the
   judgment in that case.  The conclusion at [41] of the judgment is that
   "procedural unfairness is well-established and well-understood.
   Substantive unfairness on the other hand - or 'whether there has been
   unfairness on the part of the authority having regard to all the
   circumstances' - is not a distinct legal criterion.  Nor is it made so by
   the addition of terms such as 'conspicuous' or 'abuse of power'".  I have
   already explained why I do not consider the actions taken by the
   Respondent to be unfair in any event.  I repeat the point that the First
   Appellant was allowed a period of time to find another sponsor following
   the withdrawal of sponsorship by LSBF.

55. Third, and returning to this case, looked at through the lens of
   fairness in terms of what occurred after the lists were given to LSBF, I
   do not consider that the actions of the college can be said to be unfair.
    Even if it is the case that LSBF was told to withdraw sponsorship from
   those students on the list, it did not do so without some form of due
   process.  Even it considered itself bound to remove those who were found
   likely to have breached the Rules, which would in any event be consistent
   with its duties as a sponsor, the evidence does not suggest that it
   closed its mind to the possibility that a student would be able to show,
   notwithstanding the information from the Respondent that sponsorship
   should not cease.

56. In this case, the First Appellant was given an interview, the
   opportunity to take another test to demonstrate her English language
   capabilities, and an appeal against the decision to withdraw sponsorship
   when that decision was made following her inaction in sharing the test
   results.  If one looks at those opportunities against what would have
   happened if the Respondent had taken a decision to curtail leave based
   directly on the ETS allegation, there is no unfairness at all.  In the
   common type of ETS case, the most that an appellant can achieve is the
   possibility of having his or her case tested by the Tribunal.  I do not
   suggest that an opportunity for judicial determination is not an adequate
   remedy but in such cases an appellant's language skills can only be
   considered by a Judge based on the evidence.  Here, the Appellant was
   given the, arguably better, opportunity to prove her English language
   skills via a test from another provider which is qualified to assess
   those skills for itself.  She has also had the opportunity in this appeal
   to explain what occurred at that time.  She has said that she was
   mentally unprepared for the test.  However, if that were the case, she
   could have put forward evidence to her college explaining why she had not
   passed the test.  There is nothing to suggest that she did so even on
   appeal.  The evidence suggests that the First Appellant had at least one
   month to prepare for the PTE test.

57. As I have already noted, the First Appellant was also given sixty days
   by the Respondent following withdrawal of LSBF's sponsorship to find
   another sponsor.  She says that she was unable to find a sponsor due to
   the ETS allegation.  I have already dealt at [34] above with the only
   documentary evidence of attempts to find another sponsor.  Even assuming
   it to be the case that other colleges rejected her due to the ETS
   allegation, she did not take any action against either LSBF or the
   Respondent at that time which she could have done if she considered that
   she had been treated unfairly.

58. Finally, it does not follow that, had it not been for the actions of
   the Respondent and LSBF, the First Appellant would necessarily have
   continued her studies successfully and completed a period permitting her
   and her family to remain indefinitely.  I accept that there is evidence
   that she had a high attendance record on her course.  I appreciate that
   she had completed an Extended Diploma in Management with College of
   Advanced Studies prior to enrolment with LSBF.  The documents at [AB/9-
   11] shows that she passed that course.  There are no documents showing
   that she had taken any examinations with LSBF.  That is probably
   unsurprising since she enrolled on that course only in January 2014 and
   the action to withdraw her sponsorship began in October 2014.  However,
   even in relation to that course and if she had been able to complete it
   successfully, her leave would have expired in March 2017 (the course came
   to an end in November 2016).  That period would not have taken the First
   Appellant to a period of ten years for settlement (she entered the UK in
   September 2012).  Even relying on the Second Appellant's length of
   residence, the couple would not have completed ten years' residence (he
   came to the UK as a student in November 2009 and remains in the UK only
   as the First Appellant's dependent).   A finding that the family would
   have been able to remain indefinitely had it not been for the actions of
   the Respondent and LSBF is speculative in the extreme.

59. For those reasons, applying the guidance in Patel, I do not consider it
   appropriate to either reduce the weight to be given to the maintenance of
   effective immigration control or to increase the weight to be given to
   the Appellants' private life.  The treatment of the First Appellant by
   the Respondent in 2014 and 2015 does not amount to a historical
   injustice.  It has not been shown that the Respondent acted improperly or
   made any mistake.  LSBF acted on information provided to it by the
   Respondent.  The college was bound to act on the information it was
   given.  The Respondent acted on information provided to it by ETS. There
   is no evidence that the information was not provided by ETS. The First
   Appellant was given the opportunity to show why her sponsorship should
   not be withdrawn.  Ultimately, it was withdrawn because the First
   Appellant could not satisfy LSBF via another independent test
   demonstrating her proficiency in English that the information given by
   ETS must be wrong.  The First Appellant had the opportunity to
   demonstrate that the information from ETS could not be relied upon.

60. Mr � Ceallaigh having accepted that, if the weight to be given to the
   public interest did not fall to be reduced, the Appellants could not
   succeed, I do not, strictly, need to say any more. For the sake of
   completeness and so that the Appellants understand why they have lost, I
   set out the relevant reasons.

61. The Third Appellant is a child currently aged two years.  At that age
   his best interests are to remain with his parents wherever they are.
   There is no evidence of any medical conditions or other reason why his
   best interests are to remain in the UK (see also findings of Judge
   Suffield-Thompson as preserved - [3] above). The Third Appellant has not
   been in the UK for seven years.  He does not fall within paragraph 276ADE
   (1) of the Rules.

62. The First and Second Appellants have had no leave to remain since 30
   September 2015 when their human rights claim was certified following an
   in-time application made during the sixty days given by the curtailment
   letter in April 2015.  At that point in time, the Second Appellant had
   been in the UK for just under six years.  The First Appellant had been in
   the UK for just over three years.  Both were originally here as students
   and therefore their residence was always precarious.  Neither the First
   nor the Second Appellants therefore have a sufficient period of residence
   to meet paragraph 276B of the Rules.  There is no evidence of any very
   significant obstacles to integration in Bangladesh.  The finding as
   preserved by Judge Lindsley is that, on return to Bangladesh, the
   Appellants will have family support, the opportunity to work and will not
   suffer hardship (see [3] above).

63. The Appellants are therefore unable to satisfy the requirements of the
   Rules.

64. When assessing the Appellants' claim outside the Rules, I am bound to
   have regard to the factors in Section 117A-D Nationality, Immigration and
   Asylum Act 2002 ("Section 117") so far as relevant.  Section 117B (5)
   requires little weight to be given to private life established when a
   person is in the UK when their immigration status is precarious.
   Equally, Section 117B (4) requires little weight to be given to private
   life established when a person is in the UK unlawfully.  The status of
   the Appellants throughout has been either precarious or unlawful.  The
   Third Appellant has not been in the UK for seven years.  Section 117B (6)
   has no application in this case.

65. I note the findings preserved from the decision of Suffield-Thompson as
   set out at [3] above.  Those include that there is no evidence of
   integration in the UK or, as I have noted above, of obstacles to
   integration in the Appellants' home country.  For those reasons, I can
   give only little weight to the Appellants' private lives and the impact
   on their private lives caused by removal.

66. Since I have not found there to be any good reason to reduce the weight
   to be given to the public interest in this case based on what occurred in
   the past, I give full weight to that public interest.  In this case,
   Section 117B (1) provides that maintenance of effective immigration
   control is in the public interest.  That involves the removal of persons
   who have no right to be in the UK and who are unable to meet the
   requirements of the Rules.

67. Weighing the factors for and against the Appellants, I am satisfied
   that the decision to remove the Appellants is proportionate.  Removal
   does not breach the Appellants' right to respect for their family and
   private lives.  There is no breach of their Article 8 rights.  Their
   appeals therefore fail.



Decision:

The Appellants' appeals are dismissed on human rights grounds.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   Introduction

   1. The appellants are citizens of Bangladesh. The first appellant is  the
      wife of the second appellant and mother of the  third  appellant.  The
      second appellant came to the UK as a Tier 4 student  in  October  2009
      and the first appellant  entered  the  UK  as  a  Tier  4  student  in
      September 2012. From December 2013 the second appellant had  leave  to
      remain as the first appellant's dependent. On 7th April 2014 the first
      appellant's leave to remain as a Tier 4 student migrant was  curtailed
      to expire on 9th June 2015 because the London School of  Business  and
      Finance, her college, notified the respondent that they had  withdrawn
      their sponsorship.

   2. On 8th June 2015 the first and second appellants made a  human  rights
      application, which was refused and certified as clearly  unfounded  on
      30th September 2015. On 11th November 2015 they made an application as
      the extended family members of  an  EEA  national  which  was  refused
      without a right of appeal on 10th May 2016. On 4th October  2016  they
      applied again to remain on Article 8 ECHR grounds.  These  submissions
      were rejected as a fresh claim under paragraph 353 of the  Immigration
      Rules on 13th July 2018. On 4th October 2018 an application  was  made
      by  the  first  and  second  appellants  to  remain  outside  of   the
      Immigration Rules. On 28th October 2018 the third appellant  was  born
      in the UK. On 28th  February  2019  the  application  outside  of  the
      Immigration Rules was refused as a fresh claim under paragraph 353  of
      the Immigration Rules.

   3. On 16th April 2019 the appellants made further submissions which  were
      rejected as a fresh human rights claim on 15th May  2019,  these  were
      added  to  with  further  submissions  dated  12th  August  2019,  and
      following judicial review proceedings these were reconsidered  in  the
      decision of 25th October 2019, which refused the application on  human
      rights grounds but accepted that the  representations  amounted  to  a
      fresh  claim  which  should  be  accorded  a  right  of  appeal.   The
      appellants then lodged an appeal  against  this  decision,  which  was
      dismissed on human rights grounds in a decision of First-tier Tribunal
      Judge Suffield-Thompson, promulgated on 2nd January 2020.

   4. Permission to appeal against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
      was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce, on 8th  June  2020  on  the
      basis that it was arguable that the First-tier Tribunal had  erred  in
      not weighing in the appellants favour the fact that the respondent had
      withdrawn her allegation of deception and the negative consequences of
      that allegation for the appellants.

   5. This matter comes  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
      Tribunal had erred in law in its decision,  and  if  so  whether  that
      decision should be set aside. The hearing was held remotely, by  Skype
      for Business, in light of the need to reduce the transmission  of  the
      Covid-19 virus and in light of this being found to  be  acceptable  by
      both parties and being a means by which the appeal could be fairly and
      justly determined. There were no significant issues of connectivity or
      audibility during the hearing. At the start of the hearing Mr  Lindsay
      explained that due to lockdown he did not  have  the  full  file,  and
      particularly he did not have the appellant's bundle  from  the  First-
      tier Tribunal. Mr O'Ceallaigh kindly emailed him this bundle.

   Submissions - Error of Law

   6. In the grounds of appeal drafted by Mr O' Ceallaigh, and in  his  oral
      submissions in support, it was argued for the appellants, in  summary,
      as follows.

   7. It is argued that the respondent wrongly accused the  first  appellant
      of having cheated in an English exam which led to her not  being  able
      to complete her studies for her CIMA qualification at London School of
      Business and Finance (LSBF) as  her  sponsorship  was  withdrawn.  The
      evidence that the respondent accused her of cheating is to be found in
      an email at E16 of the respondent's bundle from LSBF to the  applicant
      dated 23rd December 2014 and also is reflected in the judicial  review
      consent order of 9th September 2019, fond at E17 of  the  respondent's
      bundle, which refers to the appellant potentially  succeeding  in  her
      forthcoming appeal on the basis that she did not commit a TOEIC fraud.
      The appellants consistent  position  since  2015  has  been  that  the
      respondent had accused her of cheating and that this had  led  to  the
      withdrawal of her sponsorship and her curtailment of leave  to  remain
      as a student, and not that this allegation  emanated  first  from  the
      college, LSBF.  The first appellant had not even taken a  TOEIC  test,
      although she had booked one, and had instead  relied  upon  a  City  &
      Guilds  English  certificate,  and  any  copy   and   paste   material
      contradicting this position  in  the  representations  from  Universal
      Solicitors of 16th April 2019 was just that as initially  the  correct
      position is set out in the  letter.  The  first  appellant  could  not
      register with a new college to study at because  of  this  allegation,
      and it followed that she and the second appellant  became  overstayers
      in the UK. It is  common  ground  that  the  respondent  has  made  no
      allegation of deception directly to the first appellant.

   8. It is argued that in similar factual circumstances in R (Mohibullah) v
      SSHD (TOEIC - ETS - judicial review principles) [2016] UKUT 561  (IAC)
      it was found to be dubious conduct by the Secretary of State  to  have
      placed improper pressure on the college  to  withdraw  that  applicant
      from the course, and curtailing the appellant's leave was found to  be
      so unfair and  unreasonable  so  as  to  be  an  abuse  of  power.  In
      Mohibullah  the  Secretary  of  State  had  continue  to  pursue   the
      accusation of fraud, in this case she does not which  strengthens  the
      first appellant's position to have  been  unjustly  treated.  A  false
      accusation by the respondent led to the first appellant being  ejected
      from her course and her  leave  to  remain  was  therefore  unlawfully
      curtailed. In R (Ahsan & Others) v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 2009 the Court
      of Appeal considered that where a person was lawfully present that the
      question of proportionality was solely to be determined  by  reference
      to the question as to whether the curtailment  was  justified.  It  is
      suggested that if on a human rights appeal an appellant was found  not
      to have cheated  that  then  the  respondent  should  deal  with  that
      appellant as if their leave to remain had not  been  invalidated,  and
      perhaps an appropriate way of doing this would  be  to  make  a  fresh
      grant equivalent to that which had been invalidated.

   9. It is therefore argued that the First-tier Tribunal errs in law in the
      following ways: in not considering that  the  appellants  only  became
      overstayers due to the respondent's unlawful  action;  in  failing  to
      acknowledge that the only question to be determined was that which had
      already been decided in the appellants favour by the respondent,  i.e.
      that the first appellant did not  cheat;  that  this  factor  was  not
      considered; and that wrongly it was considered in the public  interest
      to remove the appellants and was held against them  that  they  became
      overstayers.

  10. Mr Lindsay, in his oral submissions for the respondent,  defended  the
      decision of the First-tier Tribunal. Mr Lindsay also pointed out  that
      the letter of representation  from  Universal  Solicitors  dated  16th
      April 2019  was  contradictory  as  to  whether  the  first  appellant
      maintained she had never even taken a TOIEC test. He argued  that  the
      First-tier Tribunal had  not  erred  in  law  as  they  had  found  at
      paragraph 38 of the decision that  the  "the  Home  Office  has  never
      asserted that she was a cheat" and so that this was found not to be  a
      case factually covered by Mohibullah or Ahsan where  there  was  clear
      and accepted evidence that the respondent had  alleged  the  appellant
      had cheated, followed up by a s.10 1999 Act decision  to  remove.  The
      factual and immigration position was therefore fundamentally different
      in this case law. It is argued that  it  is  clear  from  the  refusal
      decision of 25th October 2019 at paragraphs 35 and  38  that  all  the
      respondent had done was to share a large amount  of  information  from
      ETS about English language tests that had been withdrawn due to fraud.
      If  the  first  appellant's  college  had  erroneously  withdrawn  her
      sponsorship following receipt of this  information  then  that  was  a
      private law matter between her and the college, and had nothing to  do
      with the respondent, and so did not provide a basis for the  appellant
      to succeed in  remaining  in  the  UK  following  an  Article  8  ECHR
      proportionality assessment. Further the  grounds  of  appeal  did  not
      cover a challenge to the finding a paragraph 38 of the decision of the
      First-tier Tribunal, and so  this  challenge  could  not  succeed.  In
      addition the other unchallenged findings in the decision of the First-
      tier Tribunal, such as that which found that the best interests of the
      third appellant were to return to Bangladesh  where  he  had  extended
      family, were not appealed and so this appeal could  not  in  any  case
      succeed.

  11. At the end of the hearing I notified the parties that I found that the
      First-tier Tribunal had erred in law and so the decision was to be set
      aside, but that the remaking would  be  dealt  with  at  an  adjourned
      hearing. I did not give my full reasons, but informed the parties that
      I would send these reasons in writing. Initially Mr O'Ceallaigh argued
      that the matter should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal,  but  I
      said that I found that this was  not  necessary  as  the  issues  were
      limited and there was  no  need  for  extensive  remaking.  The  other
      unchallenged  findings  made  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal   in   the
      proportionality assessment  should  be  preserved.  The  parties  both
      agreed to use their best endeavours to find, serve and file the emails
      sent to the first appellant's college, LSBF, in 2014:  the  respondent
      agreed to check for them in her own physical files (as Mr Lindsay said
      they were not on the computer system) and the  appellant's  solicitors
      would try to obtain them by contacting LSBF. Both parties should  also
      check thoroughly in the judicial review bundles. It  was  agreed  that
      the matter would be remade by submissions only and that to  allow  for
      attempts to source these  emails,  in  the  context  of  the  Covid-19
      lockdown, the matter should be relisted at the  first  available  date
      after 2 months.

   Conclusions - Error of Law

  12. The First-tier Tribunal accepts, at paragraph 21 of the decision,  the
      immigration history of the appellants as set out by the respondent and
      that there is no allegation, at this point in  time,  that  the  first
      appellant obtained a TOEIC certificate by deception.  It  is  accepted
      at paragraph 28 of the decision that Article 8(1) ECHR is  engaged  as
      to remove the appellants would interfere with their private lives  due
      to their length of residence in the UK. It is recounted  at  paragraph
      34, within the section of the decision that makes the  proportionality
      assessment, that because, in 2014, the respondent advised her  college
      that she had used a proxy test taker to take her TOIEC exams she  lost
      her sponsorship from her college, and it followed that  her  leave  to
      remain as a student under Tier 4 was curtailed. It  is  recorded  that
      there was no subsequent allegation of cheating made to her by the Home
      Office. Mr Lindsay argued that at paragraph 38 the First-tier Tribunal
      concluded that the respondent had made no allegation of cheating. I do
      not find that this was the case. I find that what  is  found  in  this
      paragraph, when it is read as a whole, is that the First-tier Tribunal
      did not believe that the appellants had remained in the  UK  to  clear
      their names of the cheating allegation and the part of  the  paragraph
      cited by Mr Lindsay is in fact the evidence,  accepted  by  all,  that
      there had never been any direct allegation of cheating towards to  the
      first appellant by the respondent. I do not find that  the  First-tier
      Tribunal considered the evidence from the reasons for refusal  letter,
      the email from LSBF college and the consent order and  then  concluded
      that no allegation of cheating against the appellant by the respondent
      had been shown on the balance of probabilities.

  13. I find therefore that there was no  consideration  by  the  First-tier
      Tribunal of the contention of injustice by the  respondent  by  having
      made a false allegation of cheating to LSBF which  led  inexorably  to
      her losing her sponsorship, her leave to remain and ability  to  study
      in the UK, and  the  contention  that  there  was  a  duty,  following
      Mohibullah and Ahsan to put the appellant in  the  same  position  she
      would have been if the false allegation had not been made to the first
      appellant's college. These were live issues in the appeal  before  the
      First-tier Tribunal and it was an error of law  not  to  consider  and
      determine them.

  14. Patel (historic injustice;  NIAA   Part  5A)  [2020]  UKUT  00351(IAC)
      provides further guidance on issues of historical injustice,  such  as
      those outlined in R (Ahsan & Others) v SSHD ,where an  individual  has
      suffered as a result of the wrongful operation  by  the  Secretary  of
      State of her immigration functions. In such cases it may be that  less
      weight it due to be accorded to the public  interests  in  immigration
      control or that properly more weight should be given to the appellants
      private life ties, which would normally only be  given  little  weight
      under s.117B(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002,
      but it should not be the case that for the same reason more weight  is
      given to the private life ties of the appellants and  less  weight  to
      immigration  control.  This  pertinent  reported  case  of  the  Upper
      Tribunal  must  be  considered  by  the  parties  when  making   their
      submissions on remaking.

  15. The appeal is dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal on the  basis  that
      the appellants' removal is proportionate because: the  appellants  had
      taken insufficient steps to clear the first appellant's name so it was
      not believed that they had remain in the UK for this purpose; they had
      not returned to Bangladesh and re-entered with entry clearance as they
      could have done if the first appellant truly wished to  completed  her
      studies in the UK so it was not believed that she really  intended  to
      do this; it was not credible that the  appellants  were  supported  by
      family and friends as there was no documentary evidence  of  this;  it
      was in the best interests of the third appellant to be brought  up  in
      Bangladesh  where  the  first  and  second  appellants  would  be   in
      professional  jobs  with  wider  family  support;  if  the  appellants
      returned to Bangladesh they will have family, good work  opportunities
      and would not face hardship; and there was no evidence that they  were
      integrated in the UK or working here.

  16. I find that it cannot be said that despite the  negative  findings  in
      the  proportionality  balance,  which  I  preserve  as  they  are  not
      challenged in the grounds of appeal, that this appeal would  be  bound
      ultimately to fail as it is arguable that a new  Tribunal  might  find
      that the respondent had  communicated  to  the  LSBF  that  the  first
      appellant had cheated in her English test; and because it is  arguable
      that the authorities of Mohibullah and Ahsan mean that a finding  that
      the first appellant had not cheated, in the context of a finding of  a
      historical  injustice  by  the  respondent  in  making  an   unfounded
      allegation of cheating to her college, could weigh sufficiently in her
      favour to lead to her removal being  a  disproportionate  interference
      with her private life.




   Decision:

   1) The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law.

   2) I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  the
      appeal but preserve the findings outlined above at paragraph 15.

   3) I adjourn the remaking to a further hearing  via  Skype  for  business
      before the Upper Tribunal.

   Directions

    . The remaking hearing will consist of  submissions  only  in  a  remote
      Skype for Business hearing to be listed at the  first  available  date
      after 19th March 2021.

    . The parties will both use their best endeavours to  obtain  copies  of
      the correspondence sent by the respondent to the LSBF  in  2014  which
      led LSBF to write in their email of 23rd December 2014 that  the  Home
      Office had stated that the first appellant had used a proxy test taker
      to take her English test.

    . Any further documentary evidence  relied  upon  should  be  filed  and
      served ten days prior to the remaking hearing.

    . The time estimate is 2 hours.
