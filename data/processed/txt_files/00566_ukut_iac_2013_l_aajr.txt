Representation:

For the Applicant:         Mr C Buttler, instructed by Scott, Moncrieff and
                           Associates LLP
For the First Respondent:  Mr B McGuire QC, instructed by Creighton &
                           Partners
The Second Respondent was not represented and did not appear



                                  JUDGMENT


1.    The  applicant  has  applied  for  judicial  review   of   the   first
    respondent's (hereafter the respondent's) decision of 14 February  2013
    assessing his date of birth as 27 December 1992 and accordingly that he
    was over 20 years of age at the date of decision.  The applicant  seeks
    firstly a declaration that he is a child and secondly a declaration  as
    to his date of birth, a date to be determined by the Tribunal.

2.   It is settled law that there is no burden on either  party  in  an  age
    assessment judicial review.  My task is  to  assess  the  evidence  and
    decide on a balance of probabilities what the age of the applicant is.

3.   Before I set out the evidence and my conclusions on  it,  there  was  a
    preliminary  issue  concerning  an  application  for  an   adjournment,
    previously made on papers, and renewed by Mr Buttler  at  the  hearing.
    My determination of this point was as follows:

         "JUDGE allen: The key question as it seems to me in this matter  of
             whether or not there requires to be  an  adjournment  in  this
             case in order for the issue of whether or  not  the  applicant
             has been trafficked to be properly investigated and for him to
             have the recovery period set out  in  the  Convention  is  the
             question  of  the  potential  impact  on  the  age  assessment
             proceedings of the trafficking issue  and  it  is  the  matter
             which is very much at the heart of paragraph 11 in  particular
             of the applicant's skeleton argument.  Mr  Buttler  makes  the
             point that  the  hearing  cannot  proceed  fairly  unless  the
             trafficking issue has been addressed, on the  basis  that  the
             account that the applicant might give at that point would have
             to be seen and have to be reflected in a proper assessment  of
             his age rather than doing it on the basis of the evidence from
             the applicant that exists so far.

         2.   There is no necessary link between an age assessment, which is
             the function of this hearing, and  the  question  whether  the
             person whose age is being assessed  has  been  trafficked.   A
             person can be trafficked at any age.  The account given  by  a
             person, and the credibility of his account,  are  relevant  to
             the assessment of his age, though of course there are a number
             of other matters to be taken into account, in  particular  the
             views of the professionals and others who  have  observed  him
             and commented on such matters as his appearance, his demeanour
             and his interaction with others.

         3.   As things stand, there is a referral to the UKATC,  which  may
             or may not decide  that  it  is  reasonably  likely  that  the
             applicant has been trafficked, thus  triggering  the  recovery
             and reflection period provided for in the Convention.  Even if
             that occurs, it is conjectural as  to  whether  the  applicant
             will co-operate with the process and, even if he does,  it  is
             conjectural as to whether he  would  say  anything  different.
             And, whatever he may say will have to  be  considered  in  the
             round with his previous evidence:  it  can  not  be  taken  in
             isolation.  I disagree with  Mr  Buttler's  assertion  in  his
             skeleton argument that the fact that the applicant  has  never
             claimed to be trafficked is irrelevant.  Clearly a  trafficked
             person may, for understandable reasons, not  state  that  they
             have been trafficked, but their failure to  mention  it  is  a
             matter that must  require  consideration  and  assessment.   A
             further point, not major, but certainly not irrelevant, is the
             fact that the criminal proceedings against the applicant  have
             been stayed behind these proceedings, and an adjournment would
             cause a further delay there.

         4.   For all these reasons I have concluded that it  would  not  be
             unfair to proceed with the hearing in accordance with  Rule  2
             of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008.   I
             consider that to proceed is in accordance with the  overriding
             objective of dealing with cases fairly and justly and that the
             avoidance of delay caused by an adjournment is compatible with
             proper consideration of the issues."

4.   The hearing proceeded without any oral evidence from the applicant  and
    indeed without a statement from him.  Mr Buttler said that the decision
    that  the  applicant  should  not  give  oral  evidence  was   on   the
    instructions of the litigation friend.  On  the  applicant's  side  the
    view was that he needed the period of recovery and reflection envisaged
    in the Anti-Trafficking Convention before giving an account, and  as  a
    consequence it was not proposed that he give oral evidence.  It had not
    been claimed by  Mr  McGuire  that  the  applicant  had  to  give  oral
    evidence, and the Tribunal had not directed his attendance.

5.   Mr McGuire made  the  point  that  the  Tribunal  was  placed  in  real
    difficulties without the applicant's attendance, and it  was  difficult
    to know what his case was and indeed whose case was being put  forward.
    Mr McGuire cited what had been said by Holman J in F v Lewisham  [2009]
    EWHC 3542 (Admin), including the statement at paragraph  30  that  such
    fact-finding hearings could not  ordinarily  take  place  without  some
    involvement of the applicant and engagement of the applicant  with  the
    court.  It was accepted that the extent to  which  and  the  manner  in
    which a applicant participated or gave evidence was quintessentially  a
    matter for the judge at the hearing itself.

6.   Mr Buttler drew my attention to the decision of Judge Pearl in  KN  and
    London Borough of Barnet [2011] EWHC 2019 (Admin).  In that case it had
    been recommended that the applicant  was  unfit  to  attend  court  and
    consequently the judge was required to make a decision on her  age  and
    if possible her date of birth without the advantage of seeing  her  and
    hearing her give evidence.  The judge made the point, at paragraph  64,
    that:

         "An assessment was just that; no more than an opinion, which can be
         best achieved by professionals trained in the various  fields,  and
         not just trained as social workers, obtaining a view of the  person
         over a number of sessions."

7.   I am confronted by the same difficulty as was Judge Pearl.  I  was  not
    asked to direct the applicant's attendance and  the  hearing  proceeded
    all along on the basis that the applicant would not be giving evidence.
      Inevitably  this  causes  some  difficulties,  bearing  in  mind  the
    relevance of the applicant's credibility and his  personal  history  as
    part of the factors to be taken into account in assessing his age.   It
    is not, however, an impossible task.  It  is  common  ground  that  the
    account he has given to different people varies somewhat, and  I  shall
    have to consider what those variations are and what their relevance  is
    for the assessment as a whole.   Those  matters  reflect  both  on  his
    credibility and on what exactly his personal history is.  They  require
    to be factored into the overall evaluation, and  I  am  confident  that
    although I have not had the  opportunity  to  see  the  applicant  give
    evidence and observe  him  in  terms  of  assessing  his  age  and  his
    demeanour first hand, it seems to me that the views of the  people  who
    have observed him over a much longer period  and  who  are  trained  to
    carry  out  such  observations  are  of  particular   significance   in
    commenting on such matters as the applicant's demeanour and the age  he
    appears to be, which are relevant to the overall assessment.  It  is  I
    think in any event common ground that his physical appearance  is  very
    far from being decisive in this case.

8.   The applicant's account can be gleaned from the evidence  of  the  main
    witnesses in this case, and therefore I  will  set  out  that  evidence
    below and thereafter  come  to  conclusions  on  the  evidence  of  the
    applicant and also the evidence of the other witnesses, Mr Coulson,  Ms
    Francis, Mr Shamuyarira and Mr Brown.

9.   Since it is the decision challenged, I think  it  is  proper  to  begin
    with the age assessment and, following from that, the written and  oral
    evidence of the witnesses.  The age assessment was carried  out  on  23
    January, 7 February and 14 February 2013.  It was  carried  out  by  Mr
    Brown, who describes himself at paragraph  1  of  his  statement  as  a
    senior practitioner employed by Westminster City Council, children  and
    families team in the access and assessment service.  He obtained his MA
    in social work in 2009 and has  been  employed  by  Westminster  social
    services since then.  He has carried out a  number  of  assessments  of
    both families and children and young people.  He had never carried  out
    an age assessment previously.  It was  carried  out  jointly  with  Maz
    Mannan, a senior practitioner employed  by  Westminster  City  Council,
    children and families in the Westminster Accommodation and Leaving Care
    Team (WALC).  Mr Mannan had completed ten age assessments, having  been
    a  qualified  social  worker  since  1994,  and  since  qualifying  had
    specialised in working with young people and young adults within the 16
    to 25 age group.

10.  It is relevant to note at this stage that though  we  have  Mr  Brown's
    handwritten notes from the assessment, unfortunately Mr Mannan's  notes
    appear to have been mislaid and were never put on the system.  There is
    no statement from Mr Mannan and I did not hear oral evidence from  him.



11.  The age assessments were attended by an independent observer  from  the
    Refugee Council, Ms Sulimani, on the first two occasions and Ms Mortley
    at the third interview.  It was  explained  that  they  acted  also  as
    appropriate adults.  There  was  also  a  French  interpreter  on  each
    occasion, and all three interviews were  also  attended  by  a  student
    social worker.

12.  The applicant had first come to the attention of  the  respondent  when
    he was arrested for theft of a mobile  phone  from  a  shop  in  Oxford
    Street on 9 November 2012.  At that stage he gave a date of birth  that
    made him 13 years old and he gave an address  in  Haringey.   Enquiries
    were made and it seemed that the person, said to  be  his  uncle,  with
    whom he  said  he  was  living,  was  known  for  approximately  twenty
    offences, and the applicant said he did not have his uncle's  telephone
    number.  The judge was not satisfied that he should be bailed  to  that
    address, and the respondent carried out further interviews which caused
    it to think that he was older than 13 and potentially  an  adult.   The
    applicant then telephoned an adult male who was English and said to  be
    very well-spoken who hung  up  when  the  Youth  Offending  Team  (YOT)
    explained who they were.  The applicant then provided a further address
    in Kingston Vale and a telephone  number  for  an  adult  male  who  he
    alleged was a friend of his uncle and that person was advised to attend
    the court the next day but did not do so.  The court took the  decision
    that the applicant was 13 years old and vulnerable and remanded him  to
    the  respondent.   He  was  initially  placed  into  foster  care   but
    subsequently it was concluded that that arrangement was not working and
    he then went to live at the Cardinal Hume Centre, a 32 bed  hostel  for
    vulnerable young people aged 16 to 21, on 11 January 2013.

13.  In the assessment it is noted that the applicant claimed  to  be  a  16
    year old boy from France (claiming a date of birth of 27 December 1996)
    with an Algerian mother and French father.  It was said that he  had  a
    youthful appearance and had facial hair  on  his  chin.   He  had  been
    reported by the foster carer to shave  prior  to  meeting  with  social
    services, and the foster carer believed that he did this in  a  bid  to
    appear younger.  It was considered that he  was  very  focused  on  his
    appearance and dressed in a style  one  would  associate  with  someone
    older than 16 and in his late teens and early 20s,  i.e.  fitted  jeans
    and jackets.  He had been observed to wear a watch  and  wedding  band,
    and during an appointment with UKBA that Mr Brown accompanied him to on
    14 January 2013, he said that  he  was  removing  his  ring  and  watch
    because they made him look older.

14.  His demeanour was described in the assessment  as  very  assertive  and
    confident.  His body language indicated that he was relaxed and he  was
    able to maintain eye contact  with  both  interviewers.   At  times  he
    responded curtly to the questions he was asked and on several occasions
    lost his temper.  He gave the impression that he  was  not  taking  the
    process  seriously.   He   was   argumentative   and   challenged   the
    interviewers on several occasions, which was not  in  their  collective
    experience the behaviour of a 16 year old, but more likely someone  who
    was older and more consistent with the assertion of colleagues that  he
    was aged in his 20s.  He was confident and at times flippant which gave
    an impression of arrogance and unwillingness to engage fully  with  the
    process.   Again  it  was  thought  not  to  be  consistent  with   the
    interaction expected of a child of 16.  At  one  point  in  the  second
    interview, having given a detailed account of how he came to the United
    Kingdom, he said that one day he would tell  the  real  story  of  what
    happened.

15.  He said that his  mother  was  Najia  Djamili,  aged  55,  an  Algerian
    residing in Algiers.  His father, Krimo Saha had died in  January  2013
    and was approximately 54 when he died.  According to the applicant  his
    father was French and lived in Bordeaux until his death.   He  referred
    also to a sister aged 30 living in Algeria with her husband  and  three
    children, and another sister  aged  22  living  in  Bordeaux  with  her
    husband.  He also had a maternal half brother  who  lived  in  Malaysia
    with his wife and children and three paternal uncles and four  paternal
    aunts all living in Algeria.  He had provided contact  information  for
    his mother in  Algeria  but  efforts  made  to  contact  her  had  been
    unsuccessful apart from one occasion when she answered but the line was
    poor and the call was abandoned.  There was reference to the fact  that
    a YOT worker and a Cardinal Hume hostel worker had managed to speak  to
    the applicant's mother and she had claimed he was  16  years  old.   On
    several occasions he  had  given  permission  for  social  services  to
    contact her but only after he had spoken to her first and would not say
    why this was required to happen which  led  to  concerns  that  he  was
    telling his mother what to say to professionals.

16.  The applicant said that he was estranged from his father prior  to  his
    father's death.  He said his passport was in  his  father's  possession
    and because they were estranged he could  not  get  it  back.   He  had
    previously informed  professionals  that  other  family  members  could
    establish contact with his father to obtain his  ID  documentation  but
    this had not occurred.  He claimed not to know his father's address  at
    which he had resided for over  a  year,  which  was  considered  to  be
    improbable.

17.  There were doubts as to whether Mustapha Moussaoui,  who  he  said  was
    his mother's half brother and with whom he spent fifteen days living in
    London when he initially arrived, was actually a relative  as,  he  had
    disappeared when the applicant was accommodated by the local  authority
    and he had not mentioned him as a  relative  when  asked  about  family
    members.  He contradicted himself about friends in London, at one stage
    saying he knew no one but at other times mentioning friends within  the
    Algerian community.  He had been arrested with an older  Algerian  male
    who he claimed was a friend from France.

18.  He had claimed to the YOT that he was married to a  23  year  old  girl
    from Canada.  He had been seen to wear a wedding ring  but  refused  to
    answer questions about what it  signified  and  had  been  observed  to
    remove the ring at various times when either it was recently  commented
    on and when he wanted to present as  younger.   He  had  also  informed
    social  services  and  other  professionals  that  he  had  been  in  a
    relationship with a girl from London who was 23 years old and  who  was
    aware that he was 16, which was regarded as unlikely.

19.  He claimed to have been born in Bordeaux where he  was  brought  up  by
    his mother and father and living there also were his two  sisters.   It
    was noted that checks had been carried  out  with  the  French  Embassy
    using the name and date of birth provided and there was  no  record  of
    him, nor any record of the family members with whom he claimed  he  had
    lived in France.  He said he did not remember the address of the  house
    he grew up in.

20.  He said he  lived  with  his  family  in  Bordeaux  until  his  parents
    divorced in 2006.  He had previously referred to there  being  domestic
    violence between his parents but  did  not  mention  this  at  the  age
    assessment interviews.  At that point he  moved  to  Algeria  with  his
    mother and his sister Sarah and maternal grandmother, and they lived in
    Algiers.  He said he could not remember the  address  of  the  flat  in
    which they lived.  In the second age assessment interview he claimed he
    stayed in Algeria until the end of 2010, but in the third interview  he
    claimed he moved back to France in  2008,  having  visited  briefly  in
    2007.  After he returned to France he  moved  in  with  his  father  in
    Bordeaux, but he said he chose to leave Algeria as he did not  like  it
    there and travelled back to France on his own.  In a letter provided by
    his mother it was said that the applicant made the trip from Algeria to
    France with his father.  According to the applicant his father was  not
    happy that he had come to live with him and they did not get on and  on
    20 May 2011 he decided to move in with family  friends  in  Paris.   He
    claimed that he did not tell his father he  was  leaving  and  did  not
    bring any form of identification with him.  He claimed to be unable  to
    remember the address he was living at with his  father.   He  said  the
    connection between himself and the family he stayed with in  Paris  was
    that the grandmother of the family knew his father.  He  said  that  he
    slept at their home and spent his  days  with  friends  in  the  Barbes
    district of Paris which has a high immigrant population.

21.  He claimed that he first had the idea of coming to the  United  Kingdom
    in August 2012, because he was unhappy in France "with his parents" and
    because he knew somebody living in London.  He had no plan of  what  to
    do when he arrived and no idea of how long he wanted to stay.   He  did
    not contact his father to request the passport that he knew  he  needed
    to enter the UK and said he did not care that he had no valid  form  of
    ID.  He provided a quite detailed account of the arrangements made  for
    him to come to the United Kingdom and the fact that he paid  800  Euros
    which he had saved from monthly payments of �300-�400 his  mother  sent
    him.

22.  He said that he stayed with his uncle Mustapha  Moussaoui  for  fifteen
    days, and after a week his uncle advised him to go back to France.   He
    was arrested for theft of a mobile phone from a shop on  Oxford  Street
    on 9 November 2012 and stated that he got himself arrested deliberately
    because he did not want to live with his uncle  any  more.   After  his
    arrest he claimed that his uncle had moved to  Oxford  and  he  was  no
    longer able to contact him and the address of the uncle was visited and
    found to be empty.

23.  He continued to claim that he was 13 years old until 13  December  2012
    when he began to claim he was 15 and turning 16 on  27  December  2012,
    the same day and month as the earlier date  of  birth  he  gave.   This
    coincided with the YOT's phone conversation with his  mother  when  she
    said he was 16.  He had refused to answer when he was asked why he  had
    lied about his age.

24.  After coming into the care of Westminster the  applicant  was  arrested
    on two occasions, on 24 January 2013 for theft of a phone and  handling
    stolen goods (two other phones) for which he received a reprimand,  and
    on 4 February 2013 for theft of a  handbag  and  assault  of  a  police
    officer for which he was given a referral order.  The fact that he  was
    frequently absent from the foster placement and late  returning  caused
    that placement to end and him being moved into the hostel.

25.  The applicant  had  claimed  to  have  attended  a  primary  school  in
    Bordeaux until 2006 when he moved to Algeria but claimed he was  unable
    to remember the school's name, and when eventually he gave a name and a
    postcode this appeared to refer to the "Le Bouscat" suburb of  Bordeaux
    rather than a school.  It was considered implausible that he would  not
    know the name of the school which suggested he refused to  give  it  as
    any checks carried out would reveal his actual age.  He  said  that  he
    did not attend school while he was in Algeria.   After  he  had  denied
    attending  school  in  Bordeaux  he  was  reminded  that  he  had  told
    professionals in an earlier interview that he had been  enrolled  on  a
    vocational course and he then changed his mind and told  those  present
    he had been enrolled on a course in "Infographie"  (computer  graphics)
    three to four years ago.  It is said in the age assessment report  that
    in France the earliest age you can begin  a  vocational  course  is  15
    which means that if he had enrolled on it three to four  years  ago  he
    would be a minimum of 19 years old.  He claimed not to know the name of
    the institution at which he  was  enrolled  which  was  thought  to  be
    designed to prevent professionals from contacting the  institution  and
    verifying his age.  He claimed to have  stopped  learning  English  and
    French at age 11 but this did not appear consistent with the levels  of
    French and English he had shown that he possessed.  It was thought that
    if he stopped learning English and French at  age  11  his  command  of
    those  languages  could  only  have  been  acquired  through  the  life
    experience of somebody significantly older than 16.

26.  During the assessment it was considered to be clear that he  was  quite
    confident and self-aware and demonstrating  a  level  of  maturity  and
    independence.  It was uncertain what he did during the times in the day
    when he was away from the foster placement, however, he was taking care
    of himself and providing his own food.  The hostel when he moved  there
    reported that while he was there he did not  engage  with  any  support
    offered which suggested he did not need support to  live  independently
    and was thought to be further  evidence  that  he  was  older  than  he
    claimed to be.

27.  It was noted that he had access to money,  and  since  social  services
    had become involved he had regularly  bought  himself  new  clothes  in
    addition to an iPhone 5 and a brand new laptop.  It was said not to  be
    entirely clear how he had acquired this money, though at various points
    he had claimed to have worked in an internet caf� but  also  said  that
    his mother, who he said worked for an Algerian airline, wired him  �300
    per month via Western Union.  He said that this money was  sent  to  an
    adult friend of his who collected it on his behalf and handed it  over.
    The applicant was unwilling to give the name of  the  friend  or  allow
    professionals to contact them.  When asked what he did when  his  money
    ran out he replied "don't you worry".  He said he would be able to call
    his mother and ask for more but was not prepared to discuss the  matter
    further.

28.  It was noted that he smoked tobacco on a  regular  basis  and  consumed
    alcohol more than once a week.  He admitted to  smoking  cannabis  more
    than twice a week and had since admitted to taking MDMA which he bought
    from another resident at the hostel.  He was said to be sexually active
    and to have been involved in a relationship with a 23  year  old  woman
    since being  in  London  and  to  have  admitted  to  have  been  in  a
    relationship with a girl who lived in Canada and was also  23.   It  is
    said that he had  claimed  to  professionals  that  he  was  prescribed
    Clonazepam by a psychiatrist in 2007 but it was thought given the  date
    of birth he had given that it was unlikely that a child of 9 would have
    been prescribed this kind of medication at such a young age.

29.  It is said that a variety of professionals with whom he had  come  into
    contact had estimated his age as being older than he said.  The  foster
    carer with whom he was placed between 15 November 2012 and  11  January
    2013 maintained that he was an adult, possibly in his twenties.  It  is
    said that the doctor who examined him for his Looked-After Child  (LAC)
    medical estimated his age as 18, members of the YOT who had worked with
    him including his YOT worker believed he  was  18  or  older,  and  the
    Chelsea and  Westminster  Hospital  doctor  who  carried  out  a  child
    protection  medical  examination  believed  he  was  18.    During   an
    appointment with YOT he claimed to a YOT worker when he was claiming to
    be 13 that that was only his age in England and he was in fact 21 years
    old.  He had been asked to contact the  French  Embassy  to  obtain  ID
    documentation in order to prove his age and again was asked to do  this
    during the age assessment but refused.  He would not give a reason  for
    this.  Checks were carried out with the French Embassy using  the  name
    and date of birth he had provided and there was no record of  him.   It
    was said that if he were a French national they would have a record  of
    him under the date of birth provided.  The same checks were carried out
    for his parents and siblings and there was also no record of them.   He
    had been observed to use pseudonyms and different dates of  birth.   He
    had previously asked the social worker to contact his phone network and
    use the date of birth 27 December 1991 and had  been  observed  to  use
    that date of birth when changing the settings on his phone.

30.  The analysis of the information again led  the  assessors  to  conclude
    the applicant was believed to be over 20 years of age and his  date  of
    birth was estimated to be 27 December 1992.

31.  Clearly it will be necessary  to  return  to  this  assessment  in  due
    course.  Next however I  shall  set  out  the  written  and  then  oral
    evidence of the four witnesses.

32.  The first witness was Richard Coulson.  He  has  provided  a  statement
    dated 6 April 2013.  He was the interim housing manager at the Cardinal
    Hume Centre where the applicant has lived, until 17  April  2013.   The
    applicant was placed into the care of the centre on 11 January 2013  by
    Mr Brown.  It was as a consequence of the applicant not getting on with
    the foster carer.

33.  Mr Coulson has worked in  the  field  of  social  care  for  20  years,
    specialising in mental health, but having also worked with  challenging
    behaviour, street homelessness, substance  misuse,  young  persons  and
    refugees and asylum seekers.  He has operated as a manager since  1998,
    working in hostels, supported living and registered care  environments.
    His management role at the centre included supervision of staff, review
    of standards of support planning and risk assessing, and generally  the
    promotion of good practice in the delivery of support of all  of  their
    service users.

34.  In his statement  Mr  Coulson  described  the  applicant's  history  as
    complex and said that what  information  he  had  about  him  had  been
    gleaned through his social services paperwork, conversations  with  the
    applicant, conversations with third parties including  social  workers,
    his YOT worker and his mother as well as own interactions with him  and
    recorded notes of other staff members at the Cardinal Hume Centre.   He
    noted that the applicant's account of his life and background  had  not
    always been consistent, but he has consistently maintained that  he  is
    only 16.

35.  With regard to the applicant's  history,  the  applicant's  mother  had
    confirmed in a letter that she abandoned him when he was only 18 months
    old due to severe domestic violence perpetrated by his father  who  was
    an alcoholic and drug user.  She confirmed that the father was a French
    national.  The applicant  had  informed  Mr  Coulson,  and  his  mother
    confirmed,  that  the  applicant's   father   was   involved   in   the
    creation/installation of swimming pools and made a good living  out  of
    this.  He was reticent about his father.  He  described  not  going  to
    school in Bordeaux and simply being given money by his father  to  keep
    himself occupied.  He talked about meeting "older  men"  with  whom  he
    smoked cannabis from an early age, and Mr Coulson considered that  that
    raised questions about abuse.  He had also  admitted  involvement  with
    the police in Bordeaux which might  be  the  reason  why  he  had  been
    unwilling to provide more detailed information about his background  or
    upbringing.  He initially said that he stayed with a half-sister whilst
    in Paris but had subsequently informed his welfare  solicitor  that  he
    did not have family in France  and  the  people  he  stayed  with  were
    "family friends".  He claimed that he came to  the  United  Kingdom  to
    join his uncle Mustapha who he later admitted was not  a  relative  but
    someone his mother knew from childhood.

36.  Mr Coulson noted from his records that he had immediate  concerns  that
    the applicant might have been trafficked because of  the  circumstances
    of his arrival in the United Kingdom.  He initially maintained distance
    from staff and other service users and avoided contact.  He would leave
    the centre early afternoon and return mid-evening.  When attempts  were
    made to engage him he cited language as a difficulty but  following  an
    ESOL assessment it was agreed that in fact  he  had  a  good  level  of
    spoken  English  although  his  reading  and  writing  were  poor.   He
    responded very well to the  employment  of  an  agency  worker,  Abasse
    Djamaldini, a French national, and began to interact more  and  provide
    more information.  As regards his regular disappearances he said he had
    to see a friend in Haringey and  had  things  to  do  there.   He  made
    statements that initially appeared grandiose, for instance stating that
    he "had his plans" which they would learn about when he was  ready  and
    how he was either going to Sweden to join his mother or  to  Canada  to
    join his girlfriend.   Over  time  he  had  become  more  clinging  and
    dependent on staff at the hostel  and  showed  no  ability  to  budget,
    prepare meals, keep appointments or engage constructively even with the
    limited opportunities they were able to offer given his lack of ID  and
    his irregular status.

37.  On 29 January 2013 he admitted to Abasse that the noticeable change  in
    his mood was due to the fact that  his  mother  had  told  him  of  his
    father's  death  ten  days  previously.   Following   the   applicant's
    attendance at Highbury Youth Court on 4 February 2013  Mr  Coulson  was
    informed by Sam Brown about  concerns  as  to  the  applicant's  mental
    health and possible substance misuse and these issues were again raised
    with Mr Coulson by the applicant's YOT worker Steffi  Thorhauer,  in  a
    telephone conversation on 13 February 2013.  Mr Coulson considered that
    since the applicant's arrest at the beginning of March 2013 his  mental
    health had noticeably deteriorated.  He appeared confused and sometimes
    incoherent in conversation and veered  constantly  between  tearfulness
    and  veiled  aggression.   Other  service  users  had  talked  of   him
    "wandering in the corridor muttering to himself" and also  of  sexually
    inappropriate language/requests.  When recently stopped by  the  police
    he was alleged to have exposed himself to demonstrate that he was  only
    16.

38.  Mr Coulson went on to express his concerns at  the  possibly  that  the
    applicant had been trafficked either on the basis of sexual trafficking
    or financial trafficking or possibly both.  He referred also to a  more
    recent incident when the applicant  had  ripped  off  his  t-shirt  and
    attempted to hang himself whilst in custody  on  28  March  2013  after
    which he was placed on suicide watch.   A  referral  was  made  to  the
    NSPCC's anti-trafficking team, and on 4 April 2013 Mr Coulson spoke  to
    Terence Shamuyarira about his concerns for the applicant and understood
    that his case was being considered.

39.  Mr Coulson went on to state that while he was aware that the  applicant
    had not always told the truth or the whole story of his background,  he
    did not believe he  was  lying  about  his  age.   He  was  aware  that
    Westminster had never in fact  spoken  to  the  applicant's  mother  to
    ascertain  whether  she  verified  his  account  but  noted  that  they
    suspected that she would have been told what to say  by  the  applicant
    had they contacted her.  He wanted to clarify that his contact with the
    applicant's mother did not occur until 16 February 2013 which  was  two
    days after they were told of the decision on  the  age  assessment  and
    that it was clear from their conversation with her  that  she  had  not
    been contact by anyone else, let alone the YOT worker  who  Westminster
    had cited as having spoken with her.  The impression  when  they  spoke
    through his French speaking colleague Abasse was that  the  applicant's
    mother was genuine as she  appeared  to  know  very  little  about  the
    applicant's circumstances since  coming  to  the  United  Kingdom.   Mr
    Coulson  had  offered  to  provide  Westminster  with  a  copy  of  the
    applicant's mother's letter to them but they had said  that  they  were
    not  interested  in  her  comments  unless  she  was  able  to  provide
    documentary evidence of the applicant's  identity  and  age.   She  had
    confirmed that the applicant's father had the applicant's documents and
    Mr  Coulson  considered  this  to  be  perfectly   plausible   in   the
    circumstances.   Mr  Coulson  went  on  to  conclude  that  there  were
    significant issues around the applicant's state of mental health  which
    he felt must be investigated.  Both he and his colleagues who had daily
    contact with the applicant believed that he was a particularly troubled
    and vulnerable young lad who was in need of care and  support  and  who
    they believed to be a minor not much older than his claimed age of 16.

40.  In his oral evidence Mr Coulson confirmed that what he had said in  his
    statement was true to the best of his knowledge and  believe.   He  had
    had experience of working with trafficked people.   He  had  worked  as
    community manager of a refugee  service  where  there  were  trafficked
    individuals.  There were LGBT individuals between 18 to 65  but  mainly
    18 to 25, who were fleeing sexually-based violence and several had been
    trafficked.

41.  Mr Coulson made it clear that he could not comment  on  anything  after
    17 April 2013 when he had left the Cardinal Hume Centre.  Initially the
    applicant had been reluctant to have contact but eventually had  agreed
    to come and see Mr Coulson daily, even if only to say hello.   He  said
    that the applicant was not a particularly trusting or open person.   He
    had seen him daily for the last two months or so of  his  time  at  the
    centre.  He had had trafficking concerns from his experience of working
    with young men who were sex working.  The  applicant  had  matched  the
    pattern fairly well with regard to such  matters  as  associating  with
    older men, suffering from scabies, which  was  a  consequence  of  poor
    hygiene that could be via sexual conduct, and the  fact  that  he  left
    early and came back later.  Later on he had had more concern  that  the
    applicant had been trafficked as a pickpocket.   He  had  had  concerns
    about such  matters  as  the  applicant  asking  for  access  to  adult
    websites, and going to Finsbury Park which certainly used to be  a  gay
    area, and he would come back under the influence of pills  he  said  he
    bought there, and was agitated  and  quite  uninhibited.   He  followed
    females, muttering, and had asked females for anal  intercourse.   This
    had tended to support Mr Coulson's earlier views about sex  trafficking
    or at least the fact that he  was  involved  in  some  sort  of  sexual
    activity with which he was not happy.  It is also  the  case  that  the
    applicant adhered to fixed hours when he was out and was adamant  about
    the timing and  was  very  rigid,  which  indicated  that  he  was  not
    comfortable saying no to certain people.  He had told Mr  Coulson  that
    he went to Haringey to collect money from people which had been sent to
    them for him by his mother.  This had seemed very odd to Mr Coulson  as
    it seemed his mother did not have money and  had  little  contact  with
    him, and he did not understand why she would be sending it to a man  in
    Haringey.

42.  The applicant had told a lot of different stories and  Mr  Coulson  had
    not believed what he said about going to Canada or Sweden.  His concern
    was about the cost and the fact that he did not have travel  documents.
    With regard to raising the 3,300 Euros that would  be  needed,  he  had
    said he had his plans, in a very teenage way.  Mr Coulson was concerned
    about debt slavery.  It had never been clear whether the applicant  had
    paid to come to the United Kingdom.  When he had begun to interact with
    the staff at Cardinal Hume he was totally chaotic.   He  did  not  keep
    appointments and did not cook and could not budget.  He did not turn up
    to any ESOL appointment.  He took  the  age  assessment  decision  very
    personally.  He referred  to  Mr  Coulson  as  "father"  and  to  Debra
    Francis, Mr Coulson's successor at the Centre,  as  "mother".   He  was
    tearful and asked that they would look after him.  Mr  Coulson  thought
    he was being exploited by others in the hostel.  They would get him  to
    do silly things and it was very childish behaviour.

43.  As regards Westminster's conclusion that he was assertive and  capable,
    Mr Coulson did not think that the applicant was capable.   He  did  not
    have any daily living skills.  Mr Coulson never  found  him  assertive.
    He was sometimes sullen and obstructive.  He had  no  understanding  of
    cause and effect and had told Mr Coulson  he  had  just  said  what  he
    thought at the interviews.  At the  time  when  the  applicant  was  in
    custody and banging his head on the cell wall and  quite  disinhibited,
    the YOT worker Steffi had expressed concerns about his  mental  health.
    He had raised the issue of  whether  or  not  the  applicant  had  been
    exploited for sex purposes with Sam Brown after a couple of days but Mr
    Brown had not agreed.  Mr Coulson suspected that possibly the applicant
    had a long history of abuse.  There were  serious  concerns  about  his
    statements and his wandering around and smoking cannabis with older men
    at the age of 9 or 10 and his father being an  alcoholic  and  probably
    not a very good guardian.  He had come to the United  Kingdom  and  met
    and stayed with a criminal.  As regards the fact that Westminster  said
    his behaviour in the United Kingdom indicated that he was an adult,  Mr
    Coulson thought that one could not say that because he was  with  older
    people either he was being abused or that he was an adult.  Mr  Coulson
    thought he was at risk from these people.  He  associated  with  people
    with whom he had no choice but to associate, whether  because  he  owed
    them money or because of choice.  Even if he were 16 he could associate
    with a 27 year old.

44.  As regards the applicant's age, Mr Coulson felt that he was then 16  to
    17.  Physically he seemed to be immature and did not seem to shave, and
    his behaviour was immature, with the grandiose statements including the
    claims about a girlfriend, and his plans.  He could not see the future.
     He had little grasp of longer term planning and no independent  living
    skills.  As regards the basis of his judgment, he found  the  applicant
    very immature in comparison to other  16  to  17  year  olds.   He  was
    susceptible and easily manipulated and had a lack of social skills  and
    could not see beyond the next day.  He had no idea  of  where  he  went
    from here.  He had no plans and did not seem to feel a need for  plans.
    People developed at different rates but he seemed to be  in  the  still
    growing category and certainly did not look 20 and he thought he was 16
    and maybe 17, and he felt very confident,  though  not  100%,  in  that
    assessment.

45.  Mr Coulson commented on the nine matters set  out  at  page  5  of  the
    respondent's skeleton, concerning which it was said the  applicant  had
    particular difficulties.  The failure to obtain documents  from  France
    concerning his birth and education could be linked to  the  trafficking
    issues.  He had been quite happy for Mr Coulson and his  colleagues  to
    speak to his mother and had also  spoken  to  her  under  Mr  Coulson's
    supervision.  The absence of any records was not an age indicator.   It
    could be that he was not French or that his  birth  was  not  recorded.
    Again it was relevant to the trafficking question.   Initially  he  had
    said that his documents were at his father's flat which suggested  that
    he was not from France.  As regards the wedding ring,  Mr  Coulson  had
    never seen the applicant wearing it.  He had  said  he  had  a  ring  a
    friend had given him.  It  was  quite  subjective  and  did  not  prove
    anything.  He did not believe the remark about having  a  23  year  old
    partner anyway.  The applicant had never spoken  to  Mr  Coulson  about
    being on a graphics course.  He had once told him that he was a plumber
    and used to help his father when  he  installed  swimming  pools.   The
    inconsistencies in  his  account  were  more  indicative  that  he  had
    possibly been trafficked.  He had given quite a detailed account of his
    journey to England.  As to whether he might be hiding the fact that  he
    was older, he could be hiding other things.   Certainly  the  applicant
    told lies and the question was why he did it.  Mr  Coulson  thought  it
    was sometimes because he was very  afraid  and  sometimes  he  did  not
    understand cause and effect and wanted a situation to end.  Mr  Coulson
    had concerns that the applicant could not always tell  the  truth,  and
    even without trafficking concerns, if he came to  visit  his  so-called
    uncle there was the question of whether it was safe to talk  about  how
    he had come.  There was a lot of confusion from him as to  who  he  saw
    himself as being and a lot of  shame  about  his  background.   He  had
    created a false self, but Mr Coulson did not take that as an attempt to
    present himself as younger than he was.  He found it very hard to  face
    up to his situation and his background.  Then one would get the tearful
    clingy behaviour.  There was an element of storytelling.

46.  As regards drug taking, Mr Coulson had understood  that  the  applicant
    took  something  called  Roche  and  that  was  a  manufacturer  not  a
    medication, and he had been shown different  types  of  medication  and
    pointed to Temazepam.  The YOT worker Steffi had said  he  should  have
    been on Ritalin at his age.  It could be that he was taking  things  he
    was not prescribed.

47.  The applicant had never claimed to be 13 when Mr Coulson knew him.   He
    did not know where the claim to be 13 came  from.   The  applicant  was
    poor with numeracy and it was unclear whether he actual said he was 13.
     To them he had always claimed to be 16.  It  was  not  necessarily  an
    indication of his being older but was an indication of trafficking.

48.  On cross-examination Mr Coulson said that Cardinal Hume Centre was  for
    people of 16 to 21 as regards 90% to 95% of the occupants,  though  two
    or three could be a bit older.  They were mostly placed there by  local
    authorities, almost all  by  Westminster.   When  Mr  Brown  had  first
    brought the applicant Mr Coulson had not  done  a  full  assessment  as
    there was no interpreter and the applicant was not conversing  well  in
    English.  He had been aware that he had been in trouble with the police
    and the fact that he had said he was 13 was in the documents.   He  had
    been in foster care.  He was aware that he had admitted to not being 13
    but 16 and understood that the applicant had given a date of birth that
    made him 13 when he was initially contacted  by  the  police.   He  had
    claimed to be 16 from when Mr Coulson initially worked with  him.   The
    fact that there had been initially a  foster  care  placement  did  not
    indicate that he had made a claim of a younger age.  It  had  not  been
    suggested to Mr Coulson that he was 13.  He would not  have  taken  the
    applicant to be 13.  Asking him would be the starting point, he agreed,
    and the applicant said he was 16 and never varied.  He said he had been
    born in Bordeaux.  He had not described living with  his  siblings  and
    initially both parents in Bordeaux but had said  he  had  siblings  and
    half siblings, and it was unclear until later  on  whom  he  had  lived
    with.  Mr Brown had told him about the applicant being referred to  his
    GP while in France and that he had been for counselling when there.  He
    had not told Mr Coulson he went to college in France but at  one  point
    said he was a plumber and helped his father in his  business.   He  had
    said nothing about Infographie or  primary  school.   He  had  told  Mr
    Coulson he did not go to school.  As regards what could  be  read  into
    the fact that he could not be identified from the French records,  this
    said to Mr Coulson that no such person had been born at  any  age.   It
    could be that he was totally  illegal  in  France.   He  did  not  have
    experience of people from France who were wholly unable  to  show  they
    were from France.  He agreed that it was possible that  it  meant  that
    the applicant's account of his life was not true.  It  did  not  follow
    from the fact that he initially said he was 13 and  then  16  that  his
    entire account was untrue.  He had given a false account  of  his  life
    but whether he had given a false statement of his age  Mr  Coulson  did
    not know.  It might be that he was Algerian, but it was put to him that
    the applicant's case was not that he was born and educated in  Algeria,
    and Mr Coulson said that he could be an illegal immigrant in France. He
    did not know.

49.  Mr Brown had told Mr Coulson that the local  authority  had  asked  the
    applicant to come up with his passport and other documents  to  support
    his claim.  Because of a lack of cooperation he had got  in  a  French-
    speaking worker and the applicant had cooperated.  They had  spoken  to
    the applicant's mother about whether she could produce  anything.   She
    said she might have the Livre de Famille.  If  the  applicant  did  not
    have the documents he would not be able to provide them.  He  had  told
    them whom to discuss them  with  and  Mr  Coulson  had  done  so.   The
    applicant's mother had  said  all  the  documents  would  be  with  the
    applicant's father.  The applicant had been happy for them to speak  to
    his mother.

50.  He had used the alias Jerome Jibar.  He was  asked  why  the  applicant
    would give himself an age of 21 in respect of that name and the date of
    birth that he wanted to be used of 27 December 1991 and said he did not
    know.  It could be, given his background, that it was to get access  to
    adult  websites,  different  facilities  or  illegal  activities.   The
    applicant had said with regard to that date of birth that  it  was  his
    relative who had the same date of birth as his own date of  birth.   He
    was asked whether he had believed the applicant had a relative  exactly
    five years older than him and used his date of birth,  and  Mr  Coulson
    said that Mr Brown had told him this.  Mr Coulson had  never  seen  any
    evidence of it.  He could believe the applicant was using it.   It  was
    probably something quite dodgy for which he was using it.

51.  He had never seen the applicant wearing a ring.  He  knew  of  it.   He
    had had a watch which he had sold.  He did not know what kind.  It  had
    never been reported to him what the social  worker  said  that  he  had
    removed them to look younger.  He had never seen the applicant take any
    steps to look younger, nor had he ever seen the applicant shave to look
    younger.  It had been mentioned in a report by the foster carer and the
    applicant had said that was a very fractious relationship.  It was  the
    case that people would shave to go to meetings.

52.  Mr Coulson did not agree that the applicant dressed  quite  expensively
    on occasions.  He was quite smart when he went out,  but  his  clothing
    was not particularly expensive, being from places like Primark.

53.  As regards the  disagreement  between  him  and  Mr  Brown  as  to  the
    applicant's demeanour, Mr Coulson accepted it  could  be  different  in
    different circumstances.  The applicant had not wanted to speak to  his
    mother before Mr Coulson did.  He had asked him to be careful  what  he
    said to her as he did not want her to know that he  was  involved  with
    the police and social services.  He had not tried to prime her.  He had
    learnt only in around March about his mother telling him that she  left
    when the applicant was about eighteen months.  He had not  asked  about
    the differing accounts between the two of them as to when she went back
    to Algeria.  It was the case that  one  could  not  draw  a  chronology
    justifying his age for  quite  clear  reasons  given  his  history  and
    upbringing.  As to whether social services were right to  be  concerned
    that the story did not add up, Mr Coulson found it difficult to  expect
    a person with mental health problems and a history of  substance  abuse
    to provide a chronological history.  Mr Coulson could see the  problems
    but there was also the violent and abusive background.  It was  put  to
    him however that these were pretty basic and not very difficult  issues
    and he said that the applicant had been brought  up  by  two  or  three
    different people in Bordeaux and his mother had at times denied he  was
    her child and he was quite confused about that.  In Mr  Coulson's  view
    there had been a lack of support for his mental  health  and  substance
    abuse issues.  It could be that he would have told a different story if
    he had had the support Mr Coulson had referred to.  He seemed  to  have
    been assessed as being 20 because he could not give a coherent  account
    but there was no understanding of his mental capacity.  It was  put  to
    him that the local authority said there was no issue about  his  mental
    capacities and Mr Coulson said that they had not said so  to  him.   He
    was asked whether the applicant had capacity for all relevant  purposes
    and said it was not raised with him.  He and the YOT  officer  had  had
    concerns about the applicant's mental health.  He  had  not  been  told
    that the applicant had mental health problems and  had  capacity.   All
    had been concerned about his drug use.  Mr Coulson considered that this
    impacted on his presentation of events.  He  had  been  stoned  at  one
    meeting.

54.  Mr Coulson agreed that a person could be trafficked at any age and  the
    nature of the exploitation could be different in different cases.   His
    concern had been with regard to sexual exploitation and theft as  well,
    stealing to order.  It could be both or either.  He was  asked  whether
    he accepted that the Upper Tribunal would be  assisted  by  seeing  the
    applicant and said he was not comfortable answering that as he had  not
    seen him for a few months and he had become distressed.

55.  On re-examination Mr Coulson was asked whether, given  the  applicant's
    presentation at Cardinal  Hume  House,  his  view  would  be  that  the
    applicant's conduct meant that he was older or that he was  vulnerable.
    He said he would say that he was vulnerable and did not think that  the
    applicant knew any men of his own age, and only knew his claimed  uncle
    when he came here.  He had no basis for changing his initial firm  view
    about the applicant's age.

56.  Evidence was also provided by  Terence  Shamuyarira  who  is  a  social
    worker with the NSPCC Child Trafficking  Advice  Centre.   He  was  the
    author of a report under the national referral mechanism for  potential
    (child) victims of trafficking.  In the report Mr  Shamuyarira  made  a
    referral on the basis of the potential indicators that he found existed
    in the case of the applicant.  He met and spoke  to  the  applicant  to
    establish his journey to the UK and circumstances  and  said  that  the
    referral was based on  statements  given  to  him  by  the  applicant's
    solicitor and psychiatrist who had met and spoken to the applicant  for
    much longer than Mr Shamuyarira had.   The  potential  indicators  form
    contained a number of factors under  various  headings,  either  marked
    under the column "yes", the column "suspicion" or  left  blank  if  not
    applicable.  Mr Shamuyarira noted such matters as  the  fact  that  the
    applicant said he was offered an opportunity  to  come  to  the  United
    Kingdom, paid 800 Euros and had no passport or form of identity and his
    journey was managed by different agents.  The interpreters who had been
    present during interviews had confirmed that his French  was  the  type
    spoken on the street in France and not Algerian French, which tended to
    be mixed with Arabic.  It was  noted  that  he  had  been  disappearing
    whilst in the Cardinal Hume Centre and the staff  were  aware  that  he
    went to areas in Holloway and Finsbury Park which were associated  with
    a large Algerian population, and that the area that he  spent  time  in
    was popular for sexual  activities  and  exploitation.   While  at  the
    centre he was alleged to have shown highly sexualised behaviour and was
    said to have offered some of the residents anal sex.  He had been  also
    found with expensive  belongings  and  large  sums  of  money  with  no
    explained source.  The adult he referred to as uncle Mustapha with whom
    he had lived was not a relative but a friend of the applicant's mother,
    and when further enquiries were made it was found that the "uncle"  had
    left London and the only person linked to the address had a significant
    history of offending.  The applicant would not give a conclusive answer
    to how he knew the man who had been described as a well-spoken  English
    man whose contact he had been given and he said this was out of respect
    but it might have been out of fear.  Mr Shamuyarira also noted that the
    applicant had  some  scars  which  might  indicate  that  he  had  been
    physically harmed or abused.  Ideas that he had expressed about raising
    money  to  go  to  Canada  or  Sweden  made  him  more  vulnerable   to
    exploitation as it was not clear whom he knew in those countries or the
    reason why he had picked them.  The fact that he had attempted to  hang
    himself with a t-shirt while in police custody might be a sign of  some
    mental health problems for which he would need support, and his use  of
    drugs was noted and there were concerns that it might  have  a  further
    impact on his mental health.
57.  In his oral evidence Mr Shamuyarira said that his job  was  to  provide
    support to professionals working with  children  who  might  have  been
    trafficked into the country.  He  provided  a  range  of  support.   He
    worked exclusively with children and had been doing so  for  two  years
    and eight months.  He had had training in assessment of trafficking and
    worked  for  a  local  authority   previously,   in   particular   with
    unaccompanied asylum seekers, in Reading, for  a  year.   As  a  social
    worker he looked after children and did such things as age  assessments
    and care planning.  He had been trained in age assessments and had done
    over ten age assessments while at Reading.

58.  He had met  the  appellant  when  he  was  detained  at  Feltham  Young
    Offenders Institution and spent an hour and a half with  him.   He  had
    read Mr Coulson's  statement  and  other  documents.   As  regards  the
    applicant's age he said that when he met him he felt he was probably  a
    child  given  his  physical  appearance  and  how  he  related  to  the
    interpreter and Mr Shamuyarira.  He had no facial hair  and  was  quite
    lanky and certainly a child and he would say he was between 16 and  18.



59.  With regard to the local authority's view that  the  applicant  was  an
    adult hiding his age, Mr Shamuyarira said he had  found  many  children
    who came to the United Kingdom did not come with any ID.  He was  asked
    whether it was not suspicious that he was not in the French system  and
    he said it was difficult.  He  did  not  know  how  the  French  system
    worked.  It was possible that children who were illegal/underground  in
    another country might not be recorded.  Going missing was quite  a  big
    indication.  Traffickers would keep contact with  them.   It  could  be
    that that was happening with the applicant that he had been  trafficked
    out of safe places.  He had associated with two elder men when  in  the
    United Kingdom.  Mr Shamuyarira associated that with what was happening
    with his non-appearance as a part of sexual exploitation.   As  regards
    sexualised behaviour, it was a matter of him not being able to maintain
    appropriate boundaries.  It was part of  a  pattern.   Abused  children
    could show such signs.  Mr Shamuyarira attached quite a lot  of  weight
    to that factor.  The expensive belongings and possession of money  were
    relevant to patterns of exploitation.  Similarly the  association  with
    the claimed uncle and the older man.   The  scars  were  also  possible
    evidence of abuse.

60.  He was asked how seriously the Tribunal should  take  these  indicators
    of  trafficking  in  this  case  and  he  said  especially   after   Mr
    Shamuyarira's discussion with Diane Francis two or three weeks  ago  he
    thought  that  especially   those   around   the   applicant's   sexual
    exploitation, going to Finsbury Park and  associating  with  older  men
    were quite serious indicators.

61.  The idea of the recovery and reflection period envisaged in  the  Anti-
    Trafficking Convention was so that the person could cooperate with  law
    enforcement if they needed to.  They were waiting  to  see  if  he  was
    identified as a victim.  It was put to him that the  respondent  relied
    upon inconsistencies and lies in his account and he was asked  whether,
    where there were trafficking indicators, it was safe  to  rely  on  his
    account and he said there needed to be a lot more investigation in  the
    applicant's case.  It was common for trafficking victims to  be  fed  a
    particular story and they could be inconsistent.

62.  When cross-examined by Mr McGuire, Mr  Shamuyarira  agreed  that  there
    had  been  a  referral  and  not  a  decision.   There  were  potential
    indicators.  He would fill  in  the  form  and  ask  himself  the  nine
    questions set out at page 4 of the form.  The response would be five to
    seven days and that would be a reasonable  grounds  decision.   Article
    13.1 of the Convention was the basis.  There would be  a  recovery  and
    reflection period for 45 days and then a further  decision  on  further
    information.  He had made a decision to refer and awaited the  outcome.
    There were significant concerns  and  the  applicant  should  have  the
    benefit of doubt with regard to the age.  It was put  to  him  that  it
    seemed that the benefit went to whether there was anything in the whole
    trafficking account and he said that he could have been clearer in what
    he said.  He agreed that it was not an  age  assessment.   That  was  a
    matter of impression not assessment, and he said  the  meeting  was  in
    connection with whether the applicant had been trafficked or  not.   It
    was put to him that he had not been in a  position  to  see  where  the
    doubts lay as he had not done an assessment.  Mr Shamuyarira said  that
    it was quite clear for him to assess  the  applicant  as  a  victim  of
    trafficking rather than his age but he had an opinion  about  his  age.
    It was not an assessment, but what he felt his age to be at  the  time.
    He had been given Mr Coulson's statement and the  psychiatrist's  draft
    report.

63.  Mr Buttler clarified that there had not been a  psychiatrist's  report.
    Mr McGuire asked  Mr  Shamuyarira  whether  it  was  a  letter  to  the
    psychiatrist asking for a report, a letter of instruction, and he  said
    yes.

64.  Mr Buttler was able to clarify that it  was  the  solicitor's  summary,
    the background to the case.  Mr Shamuyarira agreed what he had seen was
    Mr Coulson's report and the draft that had just been referred to.

65.  He recalled speaking to Mr Brown on the phone.  He had  only  given  Mr
    Brown an update and they spoke about the applicant's journey.   He  had
    not necessarily given all the information.  He agreed that Mr Brown had
    the impression that he had said that  people  did  not  always  explain
    fully initially, and he might see the applicant again.  It was  put  to
    him that Mr Brown took it that there  was  nothing  yet  but  it  could
    emerge at a  later  meeting,  and  Mr  Shamuyarira  said  that  was  an
    unfortunate inference.  He was asked whether it was fair to say that he
    had changed his mind and  had  not  initially  intended  to  refer  the
    applicant when he spoke to Mr Brown but had later decided to.  He  said
    no.  He had not seen some of the other statements.  He  had  wanted  to
    iron out some elements with the applicant, so for part of  the  meeting
    he was an observer.  The second time could be  a  better  time  to  get
    information from him.

66.  On re-examination Mr Shamuyarira said that after the Feltham  visit  he
    had met Debra Francis who had given  him  significant  information  and
    indicators of sexual exploitation had come out.  He was  not  surprised
    that the applicant had not said anything about  being  trafficked.   It
    was a collection of activities and he would match up activities  to  an
    understanding of whether there had been trafficking or not.  He had not
    had the opportunity to ask about London activities.  He hoped that more
    specific areas would come out of the recovery  and  reflection  period.
    The police might decide there was not enough evidence to investigate.

67.  With regard to the Home  Office  guidance  headed  "guidance  from  the
    competent authorities" where it was said at page 14  that  "it  is  not
    uncommon for victims to initially  reject  offers  for  assistance  and
    help", Mr Shamuyarira said that this  reflected  his  experience  to  a
    great extent.  Victims might have been told that they could  not  trust
    the authorities.  Whatever plan they tried to  put  in  place,  victims
    might reject it, and it depended on  the  extent  they  trusted.   With
    regard to the reference at page 10 "children who are in  a  trafficking
    situation are often  extremely  reticent  with  information  and  often
    relate their experiences in an inconsistent way or with obvious errors.
     More often than not this will be because their stories are composed by
    others and learned", he said that reflected his  experience.   If  they
    were  coached  they  might  tell  a  person  they  trusted  the  actual
    circumstances and this could be seen as inconsistent.  Traffickers  did
    not want them to be believed.  If  there  were  grounds  to  believe  a
    person had been trafficked then they would receive a one-year residence
    permit.  Quite a few authorities would provide accommodation away  from
    London.  That would ensure that he would be  able  to  be  worked  with
    without influence.

68.  The  next  witness  was  Debra  Francis  who  has  provided  a  witness
    statement dated 24 July 2013.  In that statement she says that she is a
    qualified social worker with over twelve  years'  experience  including
    wide experience with  working  with  young  people  and  children  with
    learning difficulties including substance misuse,  asylum  seekers  and
    children who have suffered abuse.   Her  current  role  was  as  senior
    residential support worker at the Cardinal Hume Centre.  She  described
    in the statement the  nature  of  her  role.   She  had  supported  the
    applicant with his needs since arrival at Cardinal Hume in January 2013
    as part of her general duties to support all  young  persons  in  their
    care, but was allocated as his key  worker  in  April  2013.   She  had
    attended with him at meetings with social services, YOT and at  Charing
    Cross police station with him as his appropriate adult.

69.  Ms Francis  said  that  as  his  key  worker  she  interacts  with  the
    applicant on a daily basis which can range from ten minutes to half  an
    hour or more depending on the situation.  She said that his  needs  are
    high  and  he  will  often  appear  depressed  and  need   reassurance,
    encouragement  or  motivation  to  engage  generally  or  with   hostel
    activities.  He requires constant reminders  to  carry  out  his  daily
    tasks  and  his  logic  or  ability  to  reason  appropriately  is  not
    consistent.  He will not adhere or commit to any given tasks  and  will
    often forget what he has  been  asked  to  do  or  fail  to  grasp  the
    consequences of non-completion of  his  task.   He  suffers  with  mood
    swings.  She says that when she is not on shift her colleagues will see
    him and engage with him daily and keep an eye on him.

70.  She noted that since his return to the centre he was  quieter  than  he
    used to be and was quite subdued.  He did not interact with  the  other
    residents very often and was very secretive.  Previously  he  could  be
    quite boastful and would often tell a story which was very grandiose in
    content such as the account about the 23 year old girlfriend in  Canada
    and having plans no one must know.  He seemed to  want  to  portray  an
    image of someone who was  streetwise  and  independent.   Despite  that
    image he was viewed by the other residents as quite immature.

71.  Ms Francis said that the applicant  was  respectful  to  staff  at  the
    centre although there were times when he could be very challenging.  He
    would appear assertive but would often back down if he  felt  pressured
    or overcome by the person with whom he was arguing.  He did not open up
    easily and could be secretive.  He trusted no one.  She found  that  he
    did not and would not divulge information easily and it had  been  very
    difficult  to  get  any  information  about  his  upbringing   or   his
    relationship with his father, whom he found it difficult to talk about.



72.  In conclusion, she described him as a very complex character with  high
    support needs.  Nothing in her dealings with him indicated to her  that
    he was an adult.  She believed him  to  be  a  particularly  vulnerable
    young person who without support would suffer  significant  harm.   She
    also mentioned that on one occasion he claimed his mother had sent  him
    money and he was going to meet someone to collect it but she was  aware
    that he had not spoken to his mother for some time.

73.  In her oral evidence Ms Francis said that the  statement  was  true  to
    the best of her knowledge and belief.  She said that the applicant  had
    been worse since he had been fasting and it was difficult  to  motivate
    him at present.  She had a lot of experience of working with the  16-21
    age group.  She estimated the applicant's age as 16 to 17.  She was not
    sure she would go as far as 18 with his needs.  Her view was  based  on
    the fact that he did not understand cause and effect, for example  with
    regard to signing on.  He did not go to appointments.  He could not  be
    bothered and was not good at cooking.  He did not budget and  was  very
    childlike.  He used to make very  childlike  inappropriate  remarks  to
    females.  She had set boundaries with him.  She had said  that  as  she
    was not his mother he should not hug her.  This did not  register  with
    him.  He was looking for a mother figure and looking to be loved.

74.  On one occasion he said that he had �300 which he needed  to  get  back
    from the police and said he would be  safer  in  Feltham  than  in  the
    centre because he needed the money back  from  the  police.   He  would
    challenge one in a very childish way.  It was not inappropriate  sexual
    behaviour when he hugged her.  He had cried when  he  saw  her  at  the
    police station.

75.  It was put to her that it could be said that he was  an  emotional  and
    disorganised adult.  She said that could be, but if  so  he  would  not
    necessarily want to hug her.  Her judgment was based on her experience.
     You would have to show concern and work with clients' needs  and  this
    could be misconstrued as an attachment and he was capable of doing that
    and capable of forming a mother figure attachment.  She  was  not  sure
    that he processed well.  There were also concerns about  his  substance
    misuse and depression and anxiety.

76.  As regards the substance abuse he smoked cannabis and she was not  sure
    if he took MDMA.  He had no support because of his age  and  not  being
    accepted to be a child and it was similar with regard to  child  mental
    health support.

77.  The applicant could become challenging and throw  tantrums.   He  would
    apologise later.  That could be age related or not.  She saw  it  as  a
    characteristic of his.  It showed his need.

78.  She had seen the NSPCC referral and the  trafficking  indicators.   Her
    opinion, based on working with him, was  that  there  were  grounds  to
    believe he had been trafficked.  He left at set times and would not say
    whom he was seeing or why.  His trips were all in fact to Finsbury Park
    and Holloway.  At one point he had had a large sum of  money  which  he
    had said was �600.  She had not counted it.  He had said he  was  going
    to Walthamstow.  He had not returned with it.  He had told her  he  was
    getting phones and selling them, but he never had money.   He  said  he
    was getting money from his mother but he was not in  contact  with  her
    then.  He had no money.  She did not know where the money was going.

79.  She had heard some of the stories that he  had  told  Mr  Coulson,  for
    example going to Canada to meet a 19 year old girlfriend.  He  recalled
    his  father  taking  him  to  France.   He  had   helped   his   father
    building/installing swimming pools.  At paragraph 8  of  her  statement
    the age should be 19 not 23.  That story was not likely to be true, but
    to be invented.  In her judgment the story about Sweden was  a  fantasy
    and she would say it was embellished.  He had never told  her  that  he
    was married.

80.  It was put to her that the respondent said these were  indicators  that
    he was an adult.  She said that in her experience, and as a  mother  as
    well, a lot of young men would brag about  older  girlfriends,  and  it
    could be wishful thinking.

81.  She was asked about her reference to paragraph 8 of  her  statement  to
    him being immature and she said that the girls at the Centre said  that
    what he said to them and his approach was very immature.  He had  burst
    into their room and asked rude and  impertinent  questions.   They  had
    spoken of him being immature.  She had asked them to be  more  pleasant
    to him but they would not and his feelings had been hurt.   These  were
    girls of 19 to 21.  They had thought him very immature and childish and
    that he was craving affection.

82.  With regard to paragraph 9 of her statement and the  reference  to  him
    appearing assertive, he would say that he must  do  something  and  you
    could not do anything about it, and then after  you  spoke  to  him  he
    would regress.  90% of the time he would apologise as he did  not  want
    you to be angry with him.  It was put to her that the  respondent  said
    he was very assertive at the interviews and this indicated  he  was  an
    adult.  Ms Francis said it indicated to her that he tried  to  get  his
    own way, but if you persisted he would break down.

83.  With regard to the  references  to  him  disappearing  and  Westminster
    saying that this indicated he was hiding his greater age, she said that
    she read the gaps in his story as that he was meeting someone to engage
    with them and give them money and do things and he would not  tell  her
    and she had never met or seen any of his friends.  As  to  how  he  had
    come to the United Kingdom and Westminster saying he  was  hiding  what
    had happened which indicated he was older, Ms Francis said she did  not
    think he could.  He was under pressure to keep quiet she thought.   For
    example, there was the �300 issue and being safer in  prison.   He  had
    been adamant.

84.  On  cross-examination  Ms  Francis  said  that  what  was  set  out  at
    paragraph 5 of her statement setting out the applicant's background was
    what Mr Coulson had told her and it was gleaned  from  the  applicant's
    mother via Abasse.  The applicant had confirmed his father had died and
    his mother was back in Algeria and he could not go back  there  as  his
    mother's life would be at risk.  She was asked whether she believed the
    applicant was born in Bordeaux on 27 December 1996 and said she had  no
    reason or evidence not to believe this.  They had not been privy to the
    information which the local  authority  gleaned  as  a  result  of  its
    enquiries to the Embassy that there was no such person with  that  date
    of birth.  She said that the applicant had friends with contact in that
    area.  It was put to her that there  was  no  record  of  his  siblings
    either and she said that he had mentioned a sibling.

85.  Ms Francis was asked whether the absence of proof of the applicant  and
    his parents in France affected her judgment and she said no, given  her
    conversations with him.  She had no reason to disbelieve him.   It  was
    put to her that the applicant's mother said she left when the applicant
    was 18 months and this contrasted with his evidence.  Ms  Francis  said
    that the applicant told her his father took him there and took him back
    but he could not return to his mother.  She was asked whether she could
    still rely on his history given the series of different versions  about
    his movements to Algeria.  She said she could only go on what  she  was
    told.  She had not seen evidence to contradict for example that he  was
    Algerian by birth.  He had  spoken  about  incidents  in  Bordeaux  and
    people he had tried to contact  in  the  last  month  about  living  in
    Bordeaux.  She  was  asked  whether  she  was  surprised  that  he  was
    inconsistent about when he returned to France and she said not  really,
    he was not consistent with quite a few  things.   As  regards  him  not
    being able to remember his address in Bordeaux she  said  she  had  her
    reservations there.  He had spoken about an area and a street name  and
    he might be withholding information.  As  regards  the  primary  school
    name and his inability to remember that she had not gone  through  that
    with him.  She did not think he was unable to name it but  there  could
    be reasons he was not divulging it at the moment as it could  be  worse
    for him.  With regard to the college course she said she had  not  even
    been aware he had gone to college and had never seen him on a  computer
    except with other residents.  He had never referred  to  doing  such  a
    course to her.  She said that he could be very grandiose.   She  agreed
    that she had not made any enquiries of  this  nature,  and  Westminster
    had.  As to the fact that she had never formally assessed his  age  she
    said she was not qualified to do so and could only go by what she  saw.
    She was quite surprised to hear he shaved.  She had never seen  stubble
    when she woke him up.  The evidence of the foster carer in this  regard
    was put to her and she said that over a  three  month  period  she  had
    never seen it.  As regard to the reference to the ring  and  the  watch
    being taken off to make him look younger she said no he did not wish to
    look younger.  He wanted to present as an older man.

86.  On re-examination she was asked how it would affect  her  view  of  his
    age if one assumed that all he had  told  her  about  living  with  his
    father in Bordeaux and going to Algeria and his mother being there  was
    untrue.  She said that it would  not  necessarily  change  her  opinion
    about his age as she had borne in mind his behaviour, his attitudes and
    values and the way he viewed life, and these were all still  the  same.
    She could only say what she had seen.  The behaviour she saw  could  be
    very childlike and that was for the Tribunal to decide.

87.  The next witness was Sam Brown.  As set out  above,  Mr  Brown  carried
    out the age assessment with his colleague Maz  Mannan.   Mr  Brown  has
    also provided a statement dated 18 July 2013.  In it  he  confirms  who
    took part in the age assessment and that it was completed in accordance
    with the Merton guidelines.  He  says  that  the  conclusion  that  the
    applicant was assessed to be 20 years old and was given a date of birth
    of 27 December 1992 was reached on the  basis  of  numerous  pieces  of
    evidence derived from  conversations  with  the  applicant,  the  three
    formal  age  assessment  interviews  and  information   received   from
    professionals who had been involved with the case.  He notes  that  the
    French had been unable to  provide  any  documentation  to  verify  the
    applicant's claim to be a 16 year old young person  born  in  Bordeaux.
    Checks had been carried out with the French Embassy using the name  and
    date of birth he provided and there was no record of him, nor was there
    any record of any of the family members he claimed  he  lived  with  in
    France.  He had been asked to contact the French Embassy to  obtain  ID
    documentation in order to prove his age but refused to do so, giving no
    reason for his failure to do so.  He had also been unwilling to provide
    contact details to enable the local authority to verify his claim  that
    his documentation was in the possession of his late father, despite the
    fact that he had said he could obtain his father's contact details from
    other family members.  These requests were made prior to  his  father's
    death in January 2013.  He had been observed to use  the  alias  Jerome
    Djabar and a different of  birth  suggesting  he  was  older,  and  had
    previously asked social services to contact his phone network to unlock
    his phone and used the date of birth 27 December 1991 which would  make
    him 21 years of age.  He had also been observed to  use  that  date  of
    birth when changing the settings on his phone.

88.  He had claimed to the YOT worker Nathalie Stickler that he was  married
    to a 23 year old girl from Canada and had also told  her  that  13  was
    only his age in England and he was in fact 21.  He had been observed to
    wear a wedding band but since  the  early  conversation  with  Nathalie
    Stickler, he refused to answer questions about  its  significance.   He
    had been observed to remove his ring at various times  when  either  it
    had been recently commented on or he wanted to present as younger,  and
    during an appointment with the UKBA on 14 January 2013 he told Mr Brown
    he was removing the ring and his  watch  because  they  made  him  look
    older.  He told social services on 4 February 2013 that  he  was  in  a
    relationship with a woman from London aged 23 who was aware that he was
    16.  This was regarded as being unlikely.  His association  with  older
    males from the Algerian community  since  his  arrival  in  the  United
    Kingdom and his arrest for theft with a man  in  his  twenties  who  he
    claimed was a friend were seen to be indicative of the fact that he was
    older than he claimed to be.  Mr  Brown  also  notes  such  matters  as
    inconsistencies in the information the  applicant  provided  about  his
    education and his failure to name the primary school  he  attended  for
    six years in Bordeaux.  He said at paragraph 24 of the  statement  that
    there was a majority consensus among the  professionals  who  had  been
    involved with the applicant that he is older than the age he claims  to
    be.  The foster carer who looked after him for two months believed  him
    to be 20 or older.  The doctor who carried out his  Looked-After  Child
    medical examination believed he was 18.  His YOT worker believed he was
    a minimum of 18.  The  Chelsea  and  Westminster  Hospital  doctor  who
    carried out a child protection medical examination believed he was  18.



89.  Mr Brown also mentioned the claim that  the  applicant  was  prescribed
    Clonazepam by a psychiatrist in 2007 and the  implausibility  of  that.
    He presented  with  a  confidence  and  assertiveness  leading  to  the
    conclusion that they were interviewing somebody  older  than  16.   His
    youthful appearance was said to be  at  odds  with  his  assertive  and
    confident demeanour.  He had facial hair on his chin and was previously
    reported by the foster carer to shave prior  to  meetings  with  social
    services and the foster carer believed he did this in a bid  to  appear
    younger.  He was very focused on his appearance and dressed  in  styles
    one would associate with someone older than 16 in his late  teens/early
    twenties, i.e. fitted jeans and jackets.  During the interviews he  was
    very assertive and confident.  He was argumentative and challenged  the
    interviewers on several occasions which was  not  in  their  collective
    experience the behaviour of a 16 year old boy  but  more  like  someone
    older.  He was very assertive throughout all three interviews.  He  did
    not  always  appear  to  be  taking  the  interviews  seriously.    The
    conclusion was drawn that he was attempting to control and measure  his
    behaviour throughout the age assessment.  At times he was defensive and
    on occasions argumentative.  The defensiveness and failure  to  provide
    certain information gave the impression he was deliberately  preventing
    professionals from gathering the evidence  needed  and  the  conclusion
    drawn was that he was withholding information to ascertain his true age
    of someone older than 16 and in their twenties.

90.  The foster carer, who  had  significant  experience  of  looking  after
    young people, believed that he was not seeking the  nurture,  care  and
    safety of a foster placement but instead was more minded and wanted  to
    play the system  by  pretending  to  look  younger  in  order  to  gain
    accommodation and finance.  He was frequently absent during the  foster
    placement and was unable to stick to the curfew set out by  the  foster
    carer and presented as  argumentative  and  disrespectful  towards  the
    carer when he did not  get  his  own  way  or  if  she  challenged  his
    behaviour.  She felt threatened by  him  after  he  slammed  doors  and
    shouted in her face and the placement was ended soon afterwards.   This
    was seen as not reflecting the behaviour of a child who was upset  when
    things did not go to plan but more the behaviour of a young  adult  who
    is constantly seeking to  get  his  own  way.   Throughout  the  social
    services' involvement he had been requesting to move  into  independent
    accommodation and live in a flat on his own, which  suggested  that  he
    was older than he claimed to be.  He was quite confident and self-aware
    during the assessment and throughout social services' involvement while
    he was in the care of the local authority he demonstrated  a  level  of
    independence beyond that which one would expect from  a  16  year  old.
    While in the hostel prior to being detained he did not engage with  any
    support offered which  suggested  he  did  not  need  support  to  live
    independently and was further  evidence  that  he  was  older  than  he
    claimed to be.  He had  demonstrated  having  some  independent  living
    skills and in addition to shopping for groceries and providing his  own
    food on a daily basis he showed he was able to  wash  his  clothes  and
    sheets.  If he had told the truth about  how  he  came  to  the  United
    Kingdom  he  had  shown  he  was  able  to  travel   across   countries
    independently via multiple modes of transport.  It seemed unlikely that
    a person of 15 would have been able to  do  this.   There  was  ongoing
    suspicion that he had been working illegally and he had denied this but
    had been unable to explain his new purchases or expensive items in  his
    possession.  At various points he had claimed  to  have  worked  in  an
    internet caf� but also stated his mother gave him money in the  sum  of
    �300 per month via Western Union.  He was not prepared to  provide  the
    name of the friend to whom he said his mother sent the money for him to
    collect.

91.   The  applicant  did  not  mention  the  information  gleaned  by   his
    solicitors from the applicant's mother that he was born out of  wedlock
    after his mother ran away from her family who had betrothed her to  her
    cousin and when she abandoned the applicant and  was  assisted  to  get
    back to Algeria she told  her  family  she  had  been  kidnapped.   She
    claimed she was forced to marry her cousin  but  her  family  were  not
    aware that the applicant  had  been  conceived.   It  was  regarded  as
    significant  that  the  applicant's  mother  had  not  answered  social
    services' calls or attempted to contact them and  this  was  viewed  as
    part of a plan to secure finance and accommodation  for  the  applicant
    from the local authority.  The differences between his account and  his
    mother's as to his movements between France and Algeria were noted,  as
    well as his claim to be unable to name the primary school  he  attended
    in Bordeaux or the address of the flat he lived at in Algiers.

92.  As regards his time in Paris, he said the  grandmother  of  the  family
    knew his father.  He said he just slept  at  the  home  of  the  family
    friends and spent his days in the Barbes district of Paris which has  a
    high immigration population.  As set out in  the  summary  of  the  age
    assessment he gave a detailed account of how  he  came  to  the  United
    Kingdom and his stay  with  his  uncle  Mustapha  Moussaoui.   His  two
    arrests since coming into the care of Westminster were  noted  and  the
    fact that he had contradicted himself in relation to having friends  in
    London.  On various occasions he had said he knew no one but  at  other
    times mentioned friends within the Algerian community and he  had  been
    arrested with an older Algerian male who he claimed was a  friend  from
    France.   During  the  age  assessment  interviews  he  showed   having
    knowledge of the care system and admitted he had been told by  Algerian
    friends that he would be taken into foster care if he  lied  about  his
    age.

93.  In his oral evidence Mr Brown said  that  he  had  read  his  statement
    carefully  before  he  signed  it  and  it  was  true  and   accurately
    represented his views  as  to  the  age  assessment  and  the  opinions
    expressed in it.  He  said  that  when  the  applicant  was  originally
    referred  to  Westminster  they  had  decided  they  would  do  an  age
    assessment as he was clearly not 13, the age he  claimed  to  be  then.
    They had a duty to accommodate and support him.  In the period when the
    foster relationship was breaking down the applicant began to say he was
    15, turning 16.  He said that to  the  YOT,  not  to  Westminster.   It
    coincided with the conversation they had with his mother who  said  the
    same.  It was the same day and month as he had originally claimed,  but
    a different year.  He would not say why  he  had  changed  the  age  he
    claimed to be.  At the stage when they were arranging the placement  in
    the hostel, Mr Brown felt the applicant  was  older  than  he  claimed.
    They had not determined the exact age but felt it was over 18 and up to
    21 would be appropriate.

94.  There was no interpreter at the initial  meeting.   The  applicant  had
    good conversational English but it came and went.  He had indicated  he
    did not understand, so Mr Coulson had decided to close the meeting then
    and speak with Abasse who was a French worker at Cardinal Hume.

95.  After the applicant moved to Cardinal Hume he had a  key  worker  there
    and was expected to take up their support.  He was still a looked-after
    child at this point.  A Looked-After Child plan  had  been  made  which
    included things he was to be encouraged to comply with.  Mr Coulson and
    Ms Francis had provided a professional service and worked very hard  to
    try and engage him, but he did not want to.  He was away a lot and made
    himself difficult to contact.  Mr Brown had been the  allocated  social
    worker and got updates from Cardinal Hume  on  how  the  applicant  was
    doing, and was gathering information for an assessment of needs  and  a
    care plan and following up the Looked-After Child review plan.  He  had
    been the contact person in Westminster.  The applicant had been one  of
    his more active cases, especially when he had been fostered, but  after
    he went to Cardinal Hume and there were run-ins  with  the  police,  Mr
    Brown was involved then and accompanied him  to  medical  appointments.
    He  was  generally  making  efforts  to  engage  the  applicant.   They
    developed a good relationship.  No doubt the  applicant  felt  slightly
    betrayed by Mr Brown given the conclusions he came to as to his age and
    Westminster  ceasing  to  have  a  duty  to  him  and  not  paying  for
    accommodation, and that had  made  the  conclusion  Mr  Brown  came  to
    slightly difficult.  YOT were also trying to engage  the  applicant  in
    respect of the thefts.  He had not really engaged with them either.  He
    had not attended appointments.

96.  As regards the age assessments,  because  Mr  Brown  had  not  done  an
    assessment before, he did this one with his colleague  Maz  Mannan  who
    had done ten previous assessments and had a lot of relevant  experience
    with people like the applicant and people in his professed  age  group.
    They had both interviewed the applicant and Mr Brown  had  written  the
    assessment and Mr Mannan went over it and then it  was  turned  in  for
    authorisation by their managers.  He stood by his statement also.

97.  As regards the claimed date and place of birth, Mr Brown had  contacted
    the French Embassy, having asked the applicant to produce documentation
    to contact his father when he said the passport was with him.  He would
    not give his father's contact details.  The French had run some  checks
    and said there was no one of that name and date of birth that they  had
    a record of in that part of France.  They gave them  the  father's  and
    mother's names and their dates of birth.  They knew by  then  that  his
    mother was in Algeria but she had lived in France.  The  applicant  had
    said his father was a French national, born  in  France,  so  they  did
    checks on them but again there was no record of them according  to  the
    French Embassy.  They had not done checks on the applicant's sisters as
    he was unsure of their dates of birth.

98.  When the applicant mentioned  doing  the  Infographie  course,  and  it
    seemed the earliest you could do that was at 15, Mr Brown thought  that
    the applicant realised he had made a  slip  and  he  became  noticeably
    angry with himself.  As regards his health he told the local  authority
    that he had been prescribed tablets by his GP in France  and  mentioned
    Roche tablets, Mr Brown thought it was 5 milligrams.   Mr  Brown  could
    not work out what he said  he  was  prescribed  so  he  looked  on  the
    internet with the applicant and there were pictures of tablets and  the
    applicant identified one as definitely the one he had  taken  and  this
    turned out to be Clonazepam which the applicant  could  not  have  been
    prescribed at the age of 9 which was around the time  he  said  he  had
    been prescribed it.  He also said  that  the  GP  in  France  gave  him
    counselling.  He sad he did not know the  GP's  name  and  that  seemed
    unlikely and said he went weekly, in Bordeaux.  They felt that  he  had
    withheld the information to prevent them discovering his true age.

99.  With regard to Mr Coulson's view that it could be the applicant was  in
    France but below the radar, they had found it very confusing.  Mr Brown
    said he could not claim huge expertise in the French system, however it
    was not dissimilar to the British system of social services, the school
    system and health system, and he would expect  someone  who  had  lived
    there for so long to have come on the radar of one of these.  He  would
    have had contact with the services.  As to the inference they drew from
    this concerning  his  date  of  birth  he  said  that  they  looked  at
    everything together and there was a lot of evidence.  There were  holes
    in his story and inconsistencies and they felt he could not be the  age
    he claimed to be.  There was enough support for the conclusion that  he
    was significantly older than 16.

100.     As to how the applicant dressed,  he  was  always  well-turned  out
    when Mr Brown saw him.  When he was outside the  hostel  he  was  well-
    groomed and wore quite fitted clothing and had a clear appreciation  of
    style and fashion which Mr Brown saw as him being older than his years.
     With regard to the wedding ring, the foster carer initially told  them
    about seeing him wearing it and that he removed it when social services
    visited.  Mr Brown had seen that when he accompanied the  applicant  to
    the UKBA.  He removed the ring and watch in the waiting room  and  said
    when asked why he had done that, that they made him look older  and  he
    needed to take them off.  He had asked the applicant what he meant  and
    he had shrugged it off.  After that Mr Brown did not recall seeing  the
    ring again.

101. As regards the issue of physical size and maturity, Mr  Brown  said  it
    had never been about his physical appearance.  He could be 16 to 20  or
    older.  He had facial hair, not a huge amount.  The foster  carer  said
    he shaved before he attended a meeting with them and she felt this  was
    a bid to be seen to be younger.  He was claiming to be 13 at that time.
     He was slim, but the Cardinal Hume reference to  his  inadequate  diet
    could account for that.

102. As regards his general demeanour,  it  seemed  that  Mr  Brown  and  Mr
    Coulson agreed to differ.  They were clearly seeing the same thing  and
    it was a question of how you interpreted it.  Mr Brown said  that  when
    challenged, especially in the age assessment, the  applicant  could  be
    confrontational and a bit rude and abrupt.  Mr Coulson saw this as  the
    behaviour of a teenager and Mr Brown saw it as being more like  someone
    older and used to making decisions by himself.  Also the applicant used
    his charm and wit of which he had a lot.  He  put  it  on  in  the  age
    assessment and it  slipped  a  couple  of  times  and  he  used  it  to
    manipulate professionals' opinions of him.  He could be  endearing  and
    frustrating.  With regards Ms  Francis's  evidence  the  applicant  was
    somewhat childish, Mr Brown did not agree with the picture of a clingy,
    needy child.  The applicant was affectionate and quite tactile and  had
    tried to hug Mr Brown on more than one occasion.  Mr Brown had put this
    down to a reflection of his personality  and  upbringing  and  possible
    cultural background.

103. As  regards  the  personal  history  given  by  the  applicant  it  was
    confusing, and what he said about his movements did not really  add  as
    between him and his mother,  so  this  was  another  big  hole  in  the
    history.  It had indicated he  was  not  telling  the  truth.   Not  to
    remember his address  in  Bordeaux  seemed  very  unlikely.   Again  it
    prevented them doing the checks with the authorities.  Again there  was
    a gap in his story with regard to whom he went to Algeria with.  He did
    not know when he was in Algeria.  He said he spent  a  period  of  time
    when he was not attending school and his mother did not force him,  and
    he stayed with other family members there.  It was unclear how long  he
    was there and when he came back and with whom he came back.

104. Mr Brown had seen the latest correspondence concerning  an  adjournment
    for the applicant's mother to attend on video link.  It  seemed  to  be
    said that he was illegitimate and kept a secret from family members and
    evidence via video link would put her in danger in some way.  This  had
    not fitted with any account the applicant had given or that his  mother
    had given.  It was not clear when he had gone back  to  Bordeaux.   His
    mother had not been consistent about that.

105. The conclusion taken as  a  whole  as  to  his  age  was  that  he  was
    definitely older than the 16 he claimed to be.   He  was  not  a  young
    person but an adult.  Mr Mannan and Mr Brown had settled on  20,  given
    all they knew.  He was asked whether there was a bracket  and  he  said
    that looking at all the evidence together and how he came  across  they
    felt he was older than 18 given the fake date of birth and  the  alias.
    The fake date of birth would make him 21.  As regards the fake date  of
    birth issue the applicant had come to see Mr Brown for  an  update  and
    had asked him to get the service provider to unlock the  phone,  giving
    the date of birth which would have made him  21  and  in  the  name  of
    Jerome Djabar.  When Mr Brown said no the applicant ripped his name and
    date of birth from Mr Brown's notepad but left it on the table  and  Mr
    Brown kept it.  The applicant noted that he had and smiled and shrugged
    his shoulders.  This was more fuel and evidence that he was not telling
    the truth about his age.

106.     He was  asked  about  other  possible  explanations  such  as  drug
    taking.  Mr Brown said they knew quite early on, at  the  time  of  the
    foster placement, that  the  applicant  occasionally  smoked  cannabis.
    Cardinal Hume had concerns about other drugs when he  was  mixing  with
    another student who was known to  be  a  dealer.   The  suspicion  then
    became clear to Mr Brown when the applicant was arrested.  This was the
    incident when he  struggled  with  the  police  and  alleged  they  had
    attacked him.  When he had emerged from there Mr Brown was  worried  by
    his presentation.  It was not the applicant he knew.  He was erratic in
    word and a bit wide eyed and emotional, and they  later  discovered  he
    had taken MDMA.  He was asked whether the applicant's presentation then
    was explained by the drugs and Mr Brown said yes.  He  had  never  seen
    the applicant like that before.  He had accompanied  him  back  to  the
    hospital and spoke to Mr Coulson about him.  It had been  thought  that
    there could be a mental health problem, but then they learned about the
    drugs which Mr Brown thought explained  his  behaviour.   He  had  seen
    nothing else in the applicant's  conduct  otherwise  to  attribute  the
    answers that had been being discussed to drug  taking.   He  was  asked
    whether it was a fact that he would take into account in terms of  risk
    of harm to the applicant and he said it was an element of risk of  harm
    to him.

107. As regards mental health issues and Mr Coulson's misgivings,  Mr  Brown
    said it was difficult to say.  They described ups and downs in his mood
    and  it  could  be  drug-related  and/or  mental  health-related.   The
    attempted suicide could not be regarded outside the context of a mental
    health issue.  He had not seen evidence or  felt  the  need  to  gather
    evidence concerning  capacity  in  a  Mental  Health  Act  sense.   The
    applicant could be challenging, and Mr Brown thought that was a  matter
    of not being able to engage with the process.

108.     As regards the possibility of trafficking, Mr Brown  was  aware  of
    Cardinal  Hume's  concerns.   Given  the  circumstances  in  which  the
    applicant said he came to the United Kingdom with no documents this was
    raised as a possible issue with Cardinal Hume.  They  believed  he  was
    trafficked.  Mr Brown  had  completed  the  trafficking  matrix  as  Mr
    Shamuyarira had, but it produced a very different  outcome.   The  case
    seemed hugely overstated, for example things were set out as  definites
    when they should have been down as being suspected.  There were  things
    said about sexual disinhibition  which  were  not  there  or  could  be
    explained away in different ways.  There were  certain  indicators  but
    nothing that could not be explained in other ways.  The  applicant  had
    been adamant that he made his way to the United  Kingdom  having  given
    huge detail of this more than any other  part  of  his  history.   This
    showed what had happened on the journey.

109. The matrix completed by Mr Brown should have been on the  file  but  it
    was not.  It had been misplaced and he did not know where it  was.   It
    would normally be kept on the file, they would scan it onto a  computer
    and that should be what  happened,  but  it  had  not  been  done.   He
    accepted that this was his fault.  He would be happy to look again  but
    he had looked before.

110. In cross-examination Mr Brown said that he had done a two-day  training
    course on  age  assessments  one  or  two  weeks  before  he  did  this
    assessment.  He did not recall who had run it.  He had  had  no  formal
    training in identifying victims of trafficking or in working with them.
     He was aware of the government's safeguarding policy as they got a lot
    of stuff, but he did not recall having read it.  He was  asked  whether
    he was aware of the duty to investigate allegations of trafficking  and
    said if there were sufficient indications of trafficking or  a  concern
    that they had, that was enough.   It  was  put  to  him  that  he  just
    identified risk factors and he said yes, at the hearing.  If  they  had
    had significant concerns about trafficking he would have enquired about
    the next stage.

111.     He had been allocated as a  social  worker  for  the  applicant  in
    November 2012.  He had seen him  less  regularly  than  he  would  have
    liked.  The foster placement was not suitable for the applicant  as  he
    was absent and difficult to contact.  Mr Brown had gone there often  to
    see the applicant, but there were difficulties in seeing him as he  was
    not around.  It had varied.  It could be two  times  a  week  depending
    upon what was on, and then a big gap, but on average he  had  seen  him
    once every two to three weeks.  The circumstances of seeing him were to
    do formal things such as taking him to assessments and appointments but
    also while travelling with the applicant he spent quite a lot  of  time
    with him informally and he felt their relationship grew.  This was  not
    just the pre-January transfer to Cardinal Hume but for example when  he
    was arrested he had collected him from custody a couple  of  times  and
    when he had a health  appointment  with  the  Chelsea  and  Westminster
    Hospital.  Cardinal Hume had day to day care from  January  onwards  in
    the context of independent living accommodation  where  he  had  a  key
    worker and support.  He agreed that the Cardinal Hume workers  saw  the
    applicant much more often than Mr Brown had, although the applicant had
    ducked under the radar a lot while he was there.  He agreed  that  they
    would see the applicant more often  off  guard.   He  agreed  that  the
    applicant appeared youthful, but said it was necessary to put an age on
    him.  His behaviour was not consistent with him being a child.  His age
    in terms of physical appearance had not been  easy  to  determine.   Mr
    Brown thought it was in the bracket of 16 to  20.   The  applicant  had
    often gone missing and went off with older men and came  back  with  an
    unclear story and took drugs including MDMA.  As regards  having  money
    that was unaccounted for, Mr Brown said he would dispute that.  He knew
    it was not what Ms Francis said, but the applicant had told Westminster
    he was receiving money from his mother.  He was obviously making  money
    by other means and  they  did  not  know  what.   He  agreed  that  the
    applicant was a repeat criminal offender and  that  there  were  mental
    health concerns.

112. Mr Brown was referred to tab 9 of the slim bundle  and  the  suggestion
    in the email from Mr Coulson to him of 14 January  that  the  applicant
    might have been trafficked.  Mr Brown said  that  they  had  their  own
    views on the situation with regard to trafficking  and  other  reasons.
    They  were  forming  views  of  the  applicant's  age  during  the  age
    assessment process.  He accepted the point that the applicant had  been
    picked up in the company of an older man but they had not seen this  as
    him being a child.  The evidence was building  towards  their  ultimate
    view about his age.  Mr Coulson had  told  him  about  the  applicant's
    sexualised behaviour  and  Mr  Brown's  interpretation  was  different,
    seeing it as a wrong conclusion by Mr Coulson.  He thought it could  be
    viewed very differently.  Inappropriate  comments  to  women  were  not
    exclusively made by young people.  As regards the reference to anal sex
    and areas of  sexual  exploitation,  adults  made  suggestive  comments
    inappropriately and it could be a product  of  many  things,  including
    upbringing.  It was put to him that he had no  training  and  was  told
    this by a person who did and he was asked why he did nothing about  it.
    He said he thought he had explained this.  He had disagreed  with  what
    Mr Coulson had said.  There were other explanations.  That was  why  it
    was not put forward.  Mr Brown had definitely not  believed  it  was  a
    trafficking issue and this had been discussed at work and was agreed.

113. He had seen the NSPCC evidence.  He felt that a lot of the  ticks  were
    over exaggerated and overstated.  He could see what Mr Shamuyarira  was
    saying but he thought some definites should have been in the  suspected
    box.

114. With regard to the referral to  the  police  at  tab  10  of  the  slim
    bundle, this was the time  when  the  applicant  alleged  he  had  been
    assaulted by the police.  It was probably done on 6 February 2013,  the
    day after the medical.  The referral was made to the police because  of
    concerns about child abuse.

115. Mr Brown was referred to section E of this form and the  fact  that  he
    had ticked no in the box  referring  to  sexualised  behaviour  by  the
    victim.  This was because he  had  disagreed  with  Mr  Coulson.   With
    regard to his ticking no in the substance abuse/alcohol abuse  box,  he
    did not know why he had ticked that,  it  could  be  a  mistake.   With
    regard to ticking unknown in respect of mental  health  issues  it  was
    difficult with the applicant because of the age assessment process.  It
    was a question of a review by an independent officer and  whether  they
    could provide a service for the applicant.  Mr  Brown  had  called  and
    spoke to someone and they said they could not provide a  service  until
    the age assessment was completed and could not  take  on  the  referral
    until it was clear.  No other steps were taken with regard to his  age.



116. He was asked why he had ticked yes in  the  box  referring  to  raising
    trafficking as an existing risk factor and said he did not know why  he
    ticked that.  He had clearly ticked  more  than  one  box  wrong.   The
    concerns about trafficking were not his.

117. He was asked whether he had reported the concerns about trafficking  to
    the police and he said that too much weight was attached to him  having
    ticked that box.  He had made his position clear.  It was  put  to  him
    that it was contemporaneous evidence and he  said  he  did  not  recall
    ticking the box.  He was asked whether he had  known  about  the  human
    trafficking centre or how to make a referral to  it  and  he  said  his
    concerns then were not around trafficking.  He could have  enquired  if
    he needed to about the process.  He had had no reason to know about the
    centre and a referral and did not know.  It was put to him  that  there
    was no  mention  of  Mr  Coulson's  trafficking  concerns  in  the  age
    assessment document and Mr Brown expressed surprise at this and said he
    was not aware that it was not mentioned there.  He was asked whether he
    had grappled with it as part of the process and he said it was an issue
    that had come up again and again around the applicant and it  had  been
    part of their discussions all the way.  He had had a discussion with Mr
    Mannan about trafficking and whether they felt the applicant  had  been
    trafficked.  It was put to him that this was not in the  notes  of  the
    age assessment and he said that the discussion they had was  after  the
    interview and it would not be recorded in the notes.  It was put to him
    that it was not mentioned anywhere in the social services file  and  he
    said he would have to review the file.  Mr Buttler said he had reviewed
    it and there was no mention.  Mr Brown said he could not think  of  any
    document which specifically addressed it.

118. He was asked whether  he  accepted  that  if  the  competent  authority
    thought there were reasonable grounds to consider the applicant to be a
    victim of trafficking it was relevant to an age assessment, and  if  he
    had had a decision from and on this before the age assessment it  would
    influence his decision.  He said it was hypothetical and he did not see
    the relevance.  Mr Brown also said it would depend  very  much  on  the
    nature of the grounds and more information would have had to have  come
    to light which they did not have.  It  was  not  known  if  they  would
    accept  it.   It  was  hypothetical  and  he  would  have  to  see  the
    information and he was not sure he could answer.  He  agreed  that  his
    assessment was predicated on a view  that  there  was  nothing  in  the
    indicators for trafficking but that the applicant was hiding  the  fact
    that he was older.  It was suggested to him that his  view  was  partly
    based on the view that the applicant was not trafficked  and  Mr  Brown
    said it was influenced by that.  There was  plenty  of  other  evidence
    alongside it apart from the  evidence  relating  to  trafficking.   The
    applicant had given enough away in the interviews.  He  said  that  the
    assessment was holistic.  He agreed that the failure to  give  a  clear
    account of his background and movements between France and Algeria  and
    the lack of a record in France had influenced  the  decision  that  the
    applicant was 20.

119. Mr Brown was referred to tab 1 of the slim  bundle  where  there  is  a
    social services file note.  He said that this  had  been  completed  by
    Ella Crawford of  the  YOT,  reporting  to  social  services.   He  was
    referred to page 3 where it was said that the magistrates took the view
    that the applicant was 13.  Mr Brown said he  thought  that  they  felt
    they had no other choice then as the applicant  had  no  documents  and
    claimed a certain age and no appropriate adult had come forward.   They
    had advised an age assessment.

120. Tab 3 was a Looked-After Child (LAC) review, a statutory  meeting  with
    independent scrutiny.  It was suggested to him with regard  to  page  3
    and the reference to the applicant being 13  that  it  would  not  make
    sense to treat him as 13 if they thought he was  an  adult.   Mr  Brown
    said he thought it was the position local authorities found  themselves
    in.  It was necessary to go with a  person's  claim  until  and  unless
    there was evidence to go against it.   He  said  that  the  independent
    reviewing officer changed his mind when the applicant changed  the  age
    he claimed to be.  He thought that the officer felt it was the  correct
    thing to do procedurally.  He had spoken to the officer about the  case
    and he had said they did not  know  the  applicant's  age  but  it  was
    correct procedurally to treat him as 13.

121.     Mr Brown was asked where he  got  the  view  that  the  LAC  doctor
    thought the applicant was 18.  He said it was what the doctor had  told
    him.  He was referred to the first page of the second document  in  the
    slim bundle where the Looked-After  Children  doctor  was  reported  as
    advising that he concluded that the applicant was aged between  16  and
    18.  Mr Brown said his recollection was that it was 18 and he  did  not
    accept he got it wrong and that was what  he  recollected.   He  agreed
    that this clearly suggested otherwise.

122. He was aware that the applicant's mother had  told  the  YOT  that  the
    applicant was born on 27 December 1996.  He had called her on  numerous
    occasions and got through once but it was a  very  bad  line  and  they
    could not hear each other and there was  an  echo  and  the  line  kept
    cutting out.  He had rung back and there was no pickup.  He  had  tried
    more than ten times.  The last  time  he  tried  would  be  before  the
    beginning of the age assessment.

123. He was referred to page 2 of tab  8  which  was  the  child  protection
    medical report.  It was  put  to  him  that  that  did  not  involve  a
    suspicion that the applicant was thought to be older.  He was described
    as being a 16 year old boy.  Mr Brown said he thought they went on  the
    facts that Westminster had at the  time  and  the  date  of  birth  the
    applicant had given them.  He had asked about age and  they  had  given
    him their view.  It was put to him  that  that  was  not  on  the  file
    anywhere.  He said it was what the doctor told him, that the  applicant
    was 18, and he did not believe he was disremembering that.

124. He was referred to tab 4 where he was quoted as saying that he  thought
    that the applicant was 17 or 18 and the YOT thought  so  too.   He  was
    asked whether that represented his view then.  Mr Brown said it was  an
    evolving view.  A lot of the information that shaped his  view  of  the
    applicant came further down the line and his views had evolved and that
    was his thinking at the time.

125. As regards tab 5 he confirmed that that  was  correct.   He  was  asked
    with reference to page 5 of that report whether what said  there  about
    it being felt that the applicant might be aged between 17 and 18 was Mr
    Brown's view on 9th January 2013.  Mr Brown said that views changed and
    evolved.  A lot was copied and pasted from other documents.  He did not
    recall filling it out.  He had definitely written it.   It  could  well
    have reflected his thinking at the time.  It was put to him that it did
    and he agreed that it could.  It was put to him that the declaration of
    truth at the end of the statement supported it and he said he  did  not
    recall what his thinking around the applicant's age was at the time.

126. With regard to tab 6 which was an email to him from Viviane Dasilva  of
    the New Horizon Youth Centre he said he did not  recall  dealings  with
    them.  He recalled getting  the  email.   He  thought  Ms  Dasilva  had
    contacted him but they were not able to talk.  He did  not  recall  the
    conversation they had had.  He was asked whether it was  not  the  case
    that the B side at Feltham was for people aged 18 to 21 and he said  he
    was not sure.

127. He did not know why the applicant had changed his stated  age  from  13
    to 16.  He had asked him and he would not answer.  Problems with foster
    care had led to him  being  moved  to  Cardinal  Hume  which  was  less
    restrictive.  It was put to him that the applicant was then  more  able
    to go to Holloway and Finsbury Park and he said certainly he was closer
    to that area.  He had more independence.  He had never said  he  wanted
    to be able to go to those areas.

128.     He was asked whether his change of view from  the  applicant  being
    17 at the beginning of January to 20 was a consequence of  the  arrests
    and the interviews.  Mr Brown said he  did  not  remember  writing  the
    statement in the referral form or his thinking at that  time  being  so
    rigid about the applicant's age.  Their thinking was  generally  fluid.
    Nothing led them to determine his  age  conclusively  until  after  the
    interviews.

129.     At this point in the evidence being taken it was  suggested  by  Mr
    Buttler that it seemed there might  be  documents  that  had  not  been
    disclosed as there were references  to  underlying  emails  in  inbound
    emails, and after some discussion  it  was  agreed  that  it  would  be
    necessary to seek to produce the full set.

130.     This was done, and I am grateful  to  Ms  Wilson,  the  applicant's
    solicitor, in particular, and to Mr Brown and others  who  assisted  in
    the production of a further bundle of documents which was  produced  on
    the second day of the hearing.

131.     Mr Brown was asked who was Sharon Robertson, who  was  referred  to
    at tab 3.  He said he did not know who she was and  had  not  heard  of
    her.  He was asked whether he had followed this up  and  said  that  at
    that stage he thought they had concluded the age assessment so  it  was
    nothing further to do with them.   He  was  asked  whether  the  mental
    health question bore on the age assessment and he said there  had  been
    indicators, and the main  one  for  him  was  when  the  applicant  was
    released from custody and they had later discovered he had taken drugs.
     He was asked whether he had found out if  it  occurred  and  what  the
    results were, and he said that the applicant ceased  to  be  a  looked-
    after child after their decision and the case was effectively closed.

132. He was asked about tab  4  which  was  an  email  to  him  from  Rejhan
    Sylejmani, and his response.  He recalled this and he said he  did  not
    accept the criticism.  They had effectively come to  blows  over  this.
    His diary had been very full and he could only schedule  the  interview
    for that time and was under pressure to complete  the  age  assessment.
    It took some organising getting everyone there.  They had arranged  the
    set dates to get everything done.  He was as flexible as he could be at
    that point.  In the end they got another independent observer.

133. He was referred to the email to him from Emma Crawford at tab 5 and  it
    was suggested to him that it was not  just  Mr  Coulson  who  expressed
    concerns to him.  He said it was not the YOT worker.  The concerns came
    from Cardinal Hume and were being re-expressed.  He had spoken a lot to
    Emma Crawford and it was a concern from Cardinal Hume and not a concern
    she herself held.

134. Mr Brown was then  referred  to  his  notes  from  the  age  assessment
    interviews.  He agreed that this was the best record of what  was  said
    at the interviews.  He had subsequently written up  his  fifteen  point
    conclusion.  He did not recall the exact date it was sent  to  Cardinal
    Hume.  It had to be checked off by his manager and sent  to  Creightons
    on the basis that there was a good chance of  a  later  challenge.   He
    wanted to run it by them as a precautionary measure.  He had written up
    the fifteen points initially and then the rest, on Maz Mannan's advice.
     The people at Cardinal Hume had got the body of the report on 18 March
    and it had been written up over that period.  Again it had to be signed
    off by a manager and checked by Creightons.  It was in his words, based
    on his and Maz Mannan's thinking.  He had forwarded it to Mr Mannan who
    had not thought anything needed changing.  There  were  no  changes  in
    light of the  conversations  with  Creightons  that  he  could  recall.
    Rewording might have been carried out  in  light  of  discussions,  for
    example with a manager.  In this regard he was referred to the email to
    him at tab 9 of the new bundle from Joanne Forster, his  line  manager.
    He was asked whether he recalled what she thought read a bit suspicious
    and he said he thought it referred to the terms he used.  She  had  had
    an issue with him saying about the applicant lying about  his  age  and
    they had disagreed about that and Mr Brown's view had prevailed.

135. He was referred to page 3 of his interview notes and  the  checks  with
    the French Embassy.  He agreed that he had given them the date of birth
    the applicant had given to him and the details of the parents and  they
    had checked at Bordeaux Town Hall for  birth  certificates  and  did  a
    check for French passports, and the date of birth was not registered in
    Bordeaux for the date the applicant gave and he  had  not  been  issued
    with a passport in that name.  He was asked whether  they  had  done  a
    fingerprint check as suggested in the document at  tab  1  of  the  new
    bundle and said that it was received after the age assessment and  they
    were not going to revisit it.  The  applicant  had  also  been  checked
    under the name of Jerome Djabar.  With regard  to  document  7  he  was
    asked whether he had followed up the social services link  referred  to
    in the email from Dominique Fraser to him of 14 January 2013  and  said
    he had not and he did not know why not.

136. With regard to the email from Cliff Fenton to Mr Brown  of  17  January
    2013, he said Mr Fenton had suggested within the LAC planning that  was
    going on that Mr Brown contact international social services to try and
    track down the applicant's relatives and that Mr Brown had not done it.
     He had not got round to doing  it.   The  reference  to  international
    social work at page 1 of the new bundle was an action point in that  it
    had not been done.

137. Mr Brown said that he believed the applicant had lived  in  France  and
    that he had grown up in Bordeaux.  This was based on what he  said  and
    the interpreter who had been used when they went to the UKBA  who  said
    that the applicant did not have the accent of someone from Algeria  but
    from the French suburbs, so he had either lived there all his life or a
    lot of it.

138.     Mr Brown was referred to a copy of an email that  he  had  sent  to
    Richard Coulson on 17 January 2013.  He was asked why this had not been
    disclosed and he said that there  was  a  lot  of  disclosure,  he  had
    thought he had done a thorough search and looked at the threads  rather
    than printing  off  everything.   He  was  asked  whether  he  had  not
    challenged the chronology that the applicant gave in the interviews and
    he said they did suggest it.  It  was  put  to  him  that  it  was  not
    recorded and he said it could be in Mr Mannan's notes.   They  had  not
    recorded everything everyone said verbatim.  With regard to page  2  of
    the second interview, he had believed the applicant's  account  of  his
    journey to the United Kingdom.  He felt no reason to doubt he paid  800
    Euros to come to England.  He was asked what it suggested to him  about
    the applicant's status in France and said it depended upon which  story
    one went on.  It could be that the passport was with his father  so  he
    had made the trip or it could be he had a passport in a different  name
    giving a different age, so he came here to obtain the services.  It was
    put to him that the applicant had not claimed services  but  came  into
    the hands of the local authority when he was arrested.  Mr  Brown  said
    that in the interview the applicant showed he had knowledge  of  social
    services and what they could do and said that was why  he  got  himself
    arrested.  It was put to him that that was not  in  the  notes  and  Mr
    Brown said it was in his statement and  it  could  be  in  Mr  Mannan's
    notes.  The applicant had said the people  he  was  staying  with  were
    Algerian people.  He referred to family telling  him  that  if  he  was
    arrested he should say he  was  13  and  would  get  help  from  social
    services.  It was put to him that this was not in his notes and he said
    he had referred to it in his statement.

139. It was put to him that the applicant had not claimed  leave  to  remain
    on arrival as a child but had gone to live with his  "uncle"  and  that
    indicated he did not have lawful status in France and  hence  had  come
    here as he did.  He was under the radar in France.  Mr Brown said there
    were unknown factors all along in this case and the applicant had  been
    reticent about his history.  It was only because they did not have  the
    correct name and date of birth and if they  did  they  could  find  out
    quite quickly.

140.     He was asked whether he believed that  the  person  with  whom  the
    applicant initially stayed in London was an  uncle.   He  said  it  was
    difficult.  His view had fluctuated.   A  lot  of  it  was  clouded  in
    mystery.  There were references to a family-type scenario in that  part
    of London.  It could be the uncle did not want to  take  responsibility
    for looking after him.  It was put to him that the claimed uncle had  a
    long history  of  offences  and  disappeared  when  the  applicant  was
    arrested.  Mr Brown said that they did not know  that  he  disappeared.
    The appellant had said he did.  The police had done a check.  They  did
    not know why.  It was put  to  him  that  an  obvious  reason  was  the
    concerns as expressed by the NSPCC trafficking officer that this was an
    indication of trafficking.  Mr  Brown  said  that  there  were  several
    indications of trafficking in the case and a lot of other  explanations
    for the applicant's experience.

141.     As regards whether  he  believed  the  applicant's  explanation  in
    respect of the second arrest he said that you got truths  and  untruths
    with all that the applicant said and there was no competing story  with
    which to assess it.  He had had no reason to doubt what  the  applicant
    was saying.  It was put to him  that  it  sounded  like  the  grandiose
    stories told by the applicant referred to by Ms Francis, and  Mr  Brown
    said he was not sure how to comment on that.  He had no reason to doubt
    the applicant.  He had taken it at face value.

142.     Mr Brown was asked about the reference in his notes  in  the  third
    age assessment interview to the applicant "no school in France".  Later
    on he was recorded as saying that "went to primary school  in  France".
    Mr Brown said the applicant was clear that he went to primary school in
    France having initially said no.  He believed that this was  the  case.
    It was an account the applicant had given and tied in with the Bordeaux
    accent and having spent a significant amount of time there.

143. He was referred to the fact that in the first interview  the  applicant
    had said he did a vocational advertising course.  It  was  put  to  him
    that the applicant had told Mr Coulson he  had  done  plumbing  and  Mr
    Brown said it was unclear whether he had been  helping  his  father  or
    doing a course.  He had believed  that.   With  regard  to  whether  he
    believed he had done an advertising and plumbing course  he  said  that
    with the former he thought he was telling the truth and it was his  way
    of interpreting Infographie.  He agreed that it was totally  different.
    He did not recall asking him about it.  It was put to  him  that  there
    was no record of it.  He was asked whether he  believed  the  applicant
    did it at a private school and he said that they had taken him  at  his
    word.  Mr Brown did not know whether the applicant knew what it was and
    what he meant.  He did not recall asking him about it.   He  was  asked
    whether it fitted in with the manner the applicant came to  the  United
    Kingdom and his offending behaviour and he said  it  could,  a  private
    school could mean something different to the  applicant  from  what  it
    meant to us.  As regards the research he had done about French  schools
    he said he had done internet research on  vocational  courses  and  the
    document he found  described  how  schools  were  organised  in  France
    including vocational courses and starting ages.  He had not saved  that
    document.  This kind of course would begin at age 15  minimum  and  was
    usually post-16.

144. He was asked about the  reference  to  the  applicant  claiming  to  be
    Somali and being flippant and said yes, he thought  the  applicant  was
    frustrated after the issue about Infographie.  It was put to  him  that
    it would be unintelligent for the applicant to claim  attendance  at  a
    vocational college if he was claiming to be a child and he said it  had
    be seen in the context of the interview and if questions were asked  it
    would be difficult to maintain a lie.  With regard to the reference  to
    the applicant saying "don't you worry", Mr Brown  said  he  had  always
    been very elusive about his money.  He had told various  stories.   His
    mother sent money.  He had told a former carer that he was  working  in
    an  internet  caf�.   There  was  also  criminal  activity  which   was
    presumably done for profit.  He did not agree with Mr Coulson about the
    sex work.  He had not heard evidence of it.  It was put to him that  Mr
    Coulson said the signs were there  and  he  was  experienced  in  these
    matters.  Mr Brown said he did not deny they were indicators, but  they
    were indicators of many things.  He was  asked  whether  they  got  the
    receipts the applicant had said  he  would  bring  in  respect  of  the
    Western Union funds and he said they had requested them from him but he
    was not forthcoming.  It was put to him that that  suggested  he  could
    not do it, and Mr Brown said it could suggest  a  lot  of  things,  for
    example that he did not want them to contact his mother.  It was put to
    him that they had her address and he said they were not able to contact
    her.

145. He was asked about his views of Ms Francis's evidence of the  applicant
    having several hundred pounds.  Mr Brown said that remained a  mystery.
    He could not say how the applicant got it and where it  went.   He  had
    previously bought a laptop.  He said the money thing indicated that the
    applicant had been involved in criminal activity at various points.

146.     He was referred to the words written at the top of page  3  of  his
    notes at the third assessment "If I were Bilal I  would  scarper  right
    now!" Mr Brown said that that had been written by his  student  and  he
    had not known he was writing it and it was written for Mr Brown to see.
     He thought he had written it because of what the applicant  had  given
    away about the vocational course and his worsening mood in  respect  of
    that.  He was asked whether by now he had made the decision and said he
    did not remember exactly when the  student  wrote  it.   He  was  asked
    whether this was representative of the attitude to the applicant at the
    interview and he said it ebbed and flowed.  You had to  be  challenging
    as part of the procedure and needed to hone in on  and  explore  flaws.
    The applicant did not like being challenged in this way.  He would come
    in quite charming and witty but he would become more challenging  later
    on.  He was asked whether he thought the remark and his  attitude  were
    inappropriate in the light of the trafficking view of the  experts  and
    he said their attitude was 100% appropriate and the  student  was  only
    there to observe.  It was put to him that  professionals  he  had  said
    gauged the applicant's age at 18 plus in fact said he was 16 to 18  and
    he said you had to see the notes as them bringing out  ideas.   It  was
    put to him that it was he who had said it in the conclusion and he said
    that perhaps consensus was the wrong word and it was  a  majority.   He
    was asked who and said it was the YOT and one of the doctors  they  had
    spoken to.  It was put to him that they had recorded 16 and he said  it
    was the other.  It was put to him that the others had said 16 to 18 and
    16 and Mr Brown said it could be incorrect and it was a contemporaneous
    note.  The views were based on the behaviour  at  interview  and  wider
    issues.
147. It was put to him that he had earlier thought the applicant was  17  to
    18 in the email and the record of  referral.   Mr  Brown  said  he  had
    recalled why he wrote that then.  It was when the  applicant  needed  a
    new placement and in his mind he had to fight with his managers to move
    the applicant as soon as possible and they had not wanted the  move  to
    happen.  He did not know why.  He had known that the best place for the
    applicant would be a hostel and the same thing would happen at  another
    foster placement.  He had written what he wrote about the  age  as  the
    referral might not be accepted.  It was put to him at the  centre  they
    took people from 16 to 21 so it would not interfere with the  referral.
    He said there might be a worry about the vulnerabilities of  the  other
    young people in the hostel.  He was referred  to  tab  5  of  the  slim
    bundle where he had signed to say that the information he had  provided
    was correct.  It was put to him that he was now saying it was incorrect
    and that this was deliberate.  He said  no,  the  assessment  had  been
    completed.  He was referred to what he had said on 9 January 2013 about
    the applicant being 17 to 18 and that he had signed it and he said this
    was a view.  He was asked whether  he  was  seriously  saying  that  he
    thought the applicant was over 18 and was trying  to  deceive  Cardinal
    Hume to fudge the referral by writing this and Mr Brown  said  the  age
    assessment had not been completed and some people did feel he was 17 to
    18.  It was put to him that he  was  the  referrer  and  that  was  the
    implication and he said there was a certain amount  of  ambiguity.   It
    was put to him that he had created an impression and that was  not  his
    view and he said his view was within the Cardinal Hume age bracket, and
    it would be different if he had thought the applicant was 25.   It  was
    put to him that he had said there was a concern that  if  he  said  the
    applicant was an adult they might not take him, for example because  of
    vulnerable people.  He said he had been worried that other people would
    be prioritised and there were limited placements there  and  he  wanted
    him in that placement on that day.  He was asked whether he  had  given
    Cardinal Hume a misleading impression to get the applicant in and  said
    it was a leading question and it could  not  be  yes  or  no.   It  was
    tailored to people in that age bracket and he  wanted  to  get  him  in
    there with his general wellbeing at heart.  He was asked whether he had
    written the applicant was 17 to 18 to get him in and said he  had  done
    it to help the referral  and  it  could  not  guarantee  it.   The  age
    assessment was ongoing.  He did not have a fixed view but the  evidence
    was going towards the final view.  He was referred to  tab  4  of  that
    bundle as well where he was quoted as saying that he thought  that  the
    applicant was 17 to 18 and he said that was on 17 December and the view
    changed and evolved.  It was put to him that the best evidence  of  his
    view on 17 December and 9 January was that the applicant was 17  to  18
    but he was now saying why he said that which  was  trying  to  oil  the
    process of referral  to  Cardinal  Hume  which  it  was  argued  was  a
    dishonest impression to Cardinal Hume in  a  document  supported  by  a
    statement of truth.  Mr Brown denied that there was  any  tailoring  of
    the evidence.  He said that on the previous day when he  gave  evidence
    he had felt under a lot of pressure and hence he  had  returned  to  it
    today.  He had said all he could say about the referral now.

148. Mr Brown was asked whether he had asked  the  applicant  at  the  third
    interview why he had lied about his age and he said he thought that Maz
    Mannan had asked him.  He agreed  that  the  answer  was  not  recorded
    there.  Not everything was recorded there but what was noted down  were
    essentially memory prompts.  It was a matter  that  the  applicant  had
    never been able or willing to answer.  He did not recall  if  the  1991
    birthday point had  been  addressed  at  the  interviews.   As  regards
    whether he had thought the applicant was born in 1991, Maz  Mannan  and
    he had arrived at the age of 20 as it seemed to be the  age  they  felt
    the applicant was.  He had given a  variety  of  dates  of  birth.   As
    regards his levels of English and French, concerning the former it  was
    thought to be beyond someone who claimed to have spent a  lot  of  time
    outside the educational system.  Mr Brown agreed  that  children  could
    learn languages outside school.  It was a point  that  Maz  Mannan  had
    made which Mr Brown had agreed to incorporate but was not a main  point
    for him.  As regards  the  applicant's  response  at  the  end  of  the
    assessment, it was put to him that it was not like that of an assertive
    adult, and he said that it was all in the delivery and it was in a "not
    bothered" way.  They had given him the weekend to leave.   The  reasons
    in the body of the report did not reach the  applicant  as  quickly  as
    they could have done.   The  decision  about  ending  finance  for  the
    applicant was a decision for Mr Brown's managers.  It  was  unfortunate
    that they did not get the conclusions to him.  In  fact  Cardinal  Hume
    had kept him on.  He was asked whether he accepted that it  was  unfair
    to terminate services before the applicant was given the  decision  and
    he said that they had made an assessment and at that point  their  duty
    to him ceased.

149. Mr Brown was referred to the further handwritten notes of 21  pages  at
    the back of the main bundle.  He was asked whether he  thought  it  was
    unusual for a person of 16 or 17 to be concerned with their  appearance
    and he said it depended on the  person  and  many  were.   It  was  not
    uncommon.  They had considered all the evidence before  them.   It  was
    another facet.  It was put to him that there a danger if one did so  of
    not looking at each piece of evidence fairly but tailoring  each  piece
    to the overall view.  Mr Brown said it was the  same  as  his  view  on
    trafficking and it was the view he had taken.  His  view  had  evolved.
    The evidence had stacked up towards their final conclusion.  He thought
    the evidence showed he did not have a preconceived view.   In  December
    he had thought the applicant was 17 to 18 and his view  had  developed.
    He had had an open mind over the time.  Before 17 January 2013  he  had
    had an open mind about the applicant's age.  One's thinking went  in  a
    certain direction and his mind had not been made up.  It was put to him
    that this particular factor of the applicant's appearance  if  anything
    favoured him being 16 to 17, though he had said  it  indicated  he  was
    older.  Mr Brown said that one focused on one bit of evidence.  He said
    that  they  took  a  different  view.   It  was  been  interpreted   in
    conjunction with the other evidence they had.  Page 13 was part  of  Mr
    Brown's notepad.  It contained a reference to the applicant  wearing  a
    ring on the third finger of his right hand.  It was put to him that  it
    was not on the ring hand or finger and Mr Brown said  it  was  hard  to
    determine what this source was from as there was no  date.   It  looked
    like a conversation with the former carer.  He agreed that there was no
    other record.  He had not raised the ring at  the  age  assessment  and
    that had been an oversight.  He had the evidence of  it  from  his  own
    eyes when he had accompanied the applicant to the UKBA  interview.   He
    could not say what finger the ring was on then.  The applicant had been
    candid as to why he was  removing  it.   That  interview  had  been  an
    opportunity to claim asylum and see what they could do with him with no
    documentation.  He had not been hiding the ring from Mr  Brown  and  Mr
    Brown did not know why the applicant said what he did.   He  could  not
    say whether the claim to the YOT  to  be  married  to  a  23  year  old
    Canadian was true.  He had heard what Ms Francis said about  that.   He
    said the applicant lied about a lot and it could be difficult to  piece
    together what was real and what was not.  He did not  know  whether  it
    was said to make himself seem older.

150. It was put to him that he was happy to infer things  when  it  favoured
    the applicant trying to appear younger and Mr Brown said he  was  bound
    to look at it with concern.  He did not know what he made of it.  There
    was also the point about the applicant saying he was 13 in  the  United
    Kingdom.  It was evidence of him continually misrepresenting  his  age.
    It was put to him that it was hardly indicative of  him  being  younger
    and Mr Brown said that the applicant's game plan all along had been  to
    deceive professionals.  As to whether it was a weak part of such a plan
    he could not comment on  the  applicant's  plan.   The  applicant  made
    slipups.  They had  thought  it  significant  and  it  was  a  lack  of
    consistency and it could mean he was older.  It was put to him that  it
    was not in itself an indication that he was older, Mr Brown said it was
    not taken on its own but taken with the other  evidence,  yes.   As  to
    whether he believed the applicant had  a  23  year  old  girlfriend  in
    Canada, Mr Brown said that he believed the applicant did at  the  time.
    He had talked about her and seemed convincing  in  what  he  said.   He
    understood Ms Francis thought that this was rubbish and said that  they
    disagreed.  It was hard to know what to make of what the applicant said
    about going to Sweden at the time.  Mr Brown had been worried for  him.
    He had taken drugs and had just been released from custody and  it  was
    very hard to keep him on track.  He did not agree with Mr Coulson  that
    it was an indication of trafficking.  When asked why, he said that they
    had accepted that the applicant had arranged his  own  journey  to  the
    United Kingdom from France and had clearly wanted to get away from  his
    police troubles.  He had been very erratic and  incoherent.   No  doubt
    the applicant knew people who could get him into Sweden for that money.
     He had talked in terms of him organising it himself.

151. With regards to the Roche tablets, it was put to him  that  that  issue
    was not addressed in the age assessment interviews.  Mr Brown  said  he
    did not recall if it was.  He did not know the date of these notes  but
    it could be early February from his memory  of  the  visits  they  did.
    This was where the  Roche  tablets  point  began.   The  applicant  had
    visited him in his office.  The applicant did not say that he had  been
    prescribed Clonazepam.

152.     He was referred to tab 11 which was a review  document  written  up
    after the event.  He had spoken to CAMS and they had  said  they  could
    not do anything.  He had done an internet  search  with  the  applicant
    present and the applicant had identified one tablet which he  said  was
    the one he had been prescribed and he was 100% certain.  It was put  to
    him that it would not be prescribed by a psychiatrist as it referred to
    epilepsy and Mr  Brown  agreed.   He  had  done  internet  research  on
    Clonazepam.  He did not recall what the evidence he found  was  and  he
    had not produced it.

153. He was referred to a document on Clonazepam which Mr Buttler had  found
    on the  internet  and  the  fact  that  it  included  prescription  for
    children.  Mr Brown had not seen this document.  He drew  attention  to
    the difference in the amounts prescribed to children  and  adults.   He
    said that it might not have been Clonazepam.  He had gone on  what  the
    applicant had said.  He was asked what the position would have been  if
    it had been Diazepam and he said that he had seen  that  the  packaging
    was similar.

154. On re-examination Mr Brown was referred to the document produced by  Mr
    Buttler which was emailed from Richard Coulson to  him  on  17  January
    2013.  It was suggested to him that this had been disclosed on 16  July
    and Mr Brown said he thought that was the case.  He was  also  referred
    to page 3 of the document produced by Mr Buttler concerning  Clonazepam
    and what it said about children and mental health information Mr  Brown
    said it supported his view

155. That concluded the evidence.

156.     I am grateful to Mr Buttler and Mr McGuire for  their  written  and
    oral closing submissions.  I do not propose to set these  out  in  this
    determination as it is quite long enough as it is, but before assessing
    the evidence and coming to conclusions I have read with care what  both
    of them have had to say about the evidence and the  conclusions  to  be
    drawn from it.

157.     Clearly I have not been able to form a view of the applicant  based
    on his physical appearance and demeanour before me.  If those had  been
    pivotal  matters  it  would  have  been  necessary  to  accede  to  the
    adjournment request.  However, I did  not  consider  that  I  would  be
    materially disadvantaged by not seeing and observing the applicant with
    a view to coming to a conclusion as to his age.  I shall  have  to  say
    something about his credibility  in  due  course  and  that  is  a  not
    irrelevant aspect of the claim.   I  think  it  is  effectively  common
    ground that it would be extremely difficult if not impossible to assess
    his age simply from his physical appearance.   Conflicting  views  have
    been expressed as to his demeanour and I am doubtful that I would  have
    been significantly assisted by having observed  the  applicant  in  the
    course of the hearing.  Of much  greater  significance  are,  as  Judge
    Pearl pointed out in AM, the views  of  professionals  trained  in  the
    various fields who have obtained a view of the applicant over a  number
    of sessions.  In this case such assistance is to be  derived  from  the
    views of in particular Mr Coulson, Ms Francis and  Mr  Brown  who  have
    observed the applicant over a period of time and to a lesser extent the
    views of Mr Shamuyarira, since he saw the applicant only  for  an  hour
    and a half, and inevitably less weight can be attached to the views  he
    came to.

158.     It is of the course the case that not only have I  not  heard  oral
    evidence from the  applicant,  but  he  has  never  put  in  a  witness
    statement.  His case, or the case put forward on his behalf, insofar as
    it has been put forward, is to be gleaned from the various interactions
    he has had with the witnesses, and I think  that  it  is  again  common
    ground that there are, to say the least,  some  difficulties  with  his
    evidence.  It is necessary to identify the problems with  his  evidence
    and to try and assess  what  the  significance  of  the  discrepancies,
    implausibilities and failures to provide evidence is in the context  of
    the claim as a whole.

159.     In his closing submissions Mr  McGuire  set  out  at  paragraph  13
    twelve particular  factors  which  it  was  said  put  the  applicant's
    explanation to the respondent  of  his  personal  history  into  ruins.
    These are as follows:

    (a)  The evidence from the French Embassy which indicated that  he  was
         not born on 27 December 1996 as claimed.  There was  no  record  of
         anyone of that name being born there with that date of birth.


    (b)  Likewise there was no record of his parents (or rather anyone with
         their names and dates of birth) having lived there.


    (c)  He said that the documentation, in particular  his  passport,  was
         with his father, but did not produce  it  despite  having  said  he
         would do so several times.


    (d)  He gave no home address in Bordeaux.


    (e)  Inconsistent accounts as to who was in the house, when.   Did  his
         mother go back to Algeria when he was eighteen months old,  or  did
         she go back, with him, later?


    (f)  He could not recall his school's name.


    (g)  Nor could he recall how long he stayed in Algeria.


    (h)  Nor could he state with whom he returned.


    (i)  Nor could he remember the name of the college which he attended.


    (j)  Nor did his account that he started an  Infographie  course  there
         three to four years ago, which could only have started at  age  15,
         fit his case that he was only 16.


    (k)  None of this fitted his previous contention that he was only 13.


    (l)  An explanation has been provided through his solicitors as to  why
         his mother cannot give evidence which does not fit with his account
         above: she now says that his was a secret birth.


160.     Further concerns were set out at Mr McGuire's paragraph 15:

    (a)  His mobile phone was in the name of his alias Jerome which had the
         date of birth 27 December 1991, i.e. the  same  birthday  but  five
         years older exactly than  his  then-claimed  age  and  eight  years
         exactly more than his initial claimed age.


    (b)  His response in conversation with Mr Brown when he would not  deal
         with his phone as asked was revealing: having written down the date
         of birth he tore it off the page and when he  asked  later  whether
         Sam Brown had picked it up and was told yes he shrugged.


    (c)  He commented directly to Sam Brown when taking off  his  ring  and
         watch that he was doing so in order to make himself look younger.


    (d)  His "Infographie" answer was a plain admission that he was  18  to
         19.


    (e)  His response on giving that answer in interview indicated  to  Sam
         Brown that he was aware that he had made a slip up.


    (f)  Clonazepam is not given to  someone  so  young  as  the  applicant
         claimed to be.


    (g)  Counselling for someone so young  as  his  claimed  age  would  be
         striking.


161. Mr Buttler's response to this is geared rather to  the  fifteen  points
    advanced in support of Mr Brown's view that the applicant was 20, but I
    will relate these to points put forward by Mr McGuire even if it  takes
    them out of the order set out by Mr Buttler.

162. With regard to the point of the French authorities not  finding  anyone
    with the applicant's name and date of birth registered in Bordeaux,  Mr
    Buttler makes the point that the only checks done were  as  to  whether
    the applicant had a French birth certificate or a French  passport  and
    it is argued that the absence of these did not logically undermine  his
    account of living in Bordeaux.  It can, however, be seen from Dominique
    Fraser's email to Sam Brown of 17 December 2012 that  nobody  with  the
    applicant's name was born in Bordeaux on the date  that  he  gave  her.
    She also did searches in respect of his parents whose names  and  dates
    of birth were given and made searches at the town hall  in  France  and
    the directory in the Bordeaux area and could not find any details  with
    those names.

163. I assess this as evidence of some significance.  The interpreters  were
    apparently confident that the applicant  spoke  French  with  a  French
    rather than an Algerian accent and it was consistent with his claim  to
    be a French national and someone who had spent a good number  of  years
    in France.  The checks carried out by Dominique Fraser are clear.  This
    is a matter on  which  the  applicant  has  lied.   Although  there  is
    evidence of efforts made on his behalf by his solicitor,  they  led  to
    the same outcome.  It is also relevant that he made no effort to obtain
    the documentation which he said had been left at  his  father's  house.
    It is also relevant that he did not give a  home  address  in  Bordeaux
    despite having claimed to live there for several years at an  age  when
    he could be expected to remember it.  In this regard  it  is,  however,
    relevant to bear in mind the point made by Mr Buttler that what he  has
    done in effect is refuse to give a full history, and  that  that  could
    indicate that his full history is  being  concealed  because  it  would
    reveal him to be older but there needs also to be  borne  in  mind  the
    expert opinion of Mr Coulson and Mr Shamuyarira that this was a sign of
    trafficking.

164. No doubt the same comment is of relevance  to  the  inconsistencies  in
    the applicant's account and as between him and his  mother  as  to  his
    movements between France and Algeria.  That is clearly on the  face  of
    it at least damaging to his credibility, and as I  said  when  refusing
    the adjournment application, anything he might say at the  end  of  any
    reflection and recovery period that he was offered and  took  advantage
    of would still have  to  be  assessed  in  the  light  of  the  earlier
    evidence.  But, on the face of it at  least,  these  are  discrepancies
    which go adverse to the applicant's credibility.

165. As regards the issue of the Infographie course, it is the case that  Mr
    Brown, as Mr Buttler pointed out, has  not  produced  documentation  to
    back his recollection of the internet search that he carried  out.   Mr
    Buttler's point on this is that the matter is highly  speculative.   Ms
    Francis's evidence was that at the Cardinal Hume Centre  the  applicant
    showed less aptitude with computers than the  other  young  people  and
    there was no objective evidence of how  Infographie  is  taught  or  to
    which age groups.  The point in my view is a neutral one only.

166. As regards the point that the applicant had originally  claimed  to  be
    13 and subsequently changed that to 16, the point is made by Mr Buttler
    that this indicates only that he told a  lie  and  does  not  logically
    indicate that he is 20.  He considered it to be more  significant  that
    the Magistrates' Court believed the applicant, another matter to  which
    I shall return below.

167. As regards the point that he had used the date of birth of 27  December
    1991 to unlock his phone and told the YOT worker that  he  was  21,  Mr
    Buttler makes the fair point that the respondent does  not  think  that
    the applicant was born in 1991 so this was not a case  of  him  letting
    the truth slip.  It might be said to be indicative of  person  claiming
    to be a greater age than he was, but the reasons for doing that are, as
    was suggested in evidence, many, and may just as  easily  relate  to  a
    person trying to get access to information which his actual age  denies
    him.

168. As regards the evidence that he said  he  was  21  and  claimed  to  be
    engaged to a 23 year old  woman  in  Canada  and  had  a  23  year  old
    girlfriend in London, these are matters that seem very  much  to  chime
    with Ms Francis's view of the grandiose ways  in  which  the  applicant
    expressed himself from time to time.

169.     The issue of him taking off his ring  and  watch  to  make  himself
    look younger is a matter that emerged in  particular  from  Mr  Brown's
    evidence.  The point is clearly a relevant one.  The  issue  about  the
    Clonazepam is I think essentially neutral.  It seemed  clear  from  the
    documentation that was  produced  by  Mr  Buttler  that,  as  Mr  Brown
    accepted, it could be that it was not Clonazepam that the applicant was
    talking about and of course epilepsy drugs would be most unlikely to be
    prescribed by a psychiatrist.  Clonazepam can in any event,  it  seems,
    be given to children albeit in much smaller doses than would  be  given
    to adults.  The suggestion that counselling for somebody  as  young  as
    the applicant claims to be is unlikely is a  fair  comment  but  it  is
    clearly not an impossibility.

170.     Taking the credibility issues as a whole,  I  consider  that  there
    are matters  in  relation  to  which  the  applicant's  credibility  is
    damaged.  The matters to which I attach particular weight are the  fact
    that there was nobody of his name  and  date  of  birth  who  could  be
    identified as having been born in Bordeaux when he claimed  or  at  all
    (and nor could his parents be identified from their names and dates  of
    birth), and the discrepancies in the  accounts  given  by  him  and  as
    between him and his mother of his movements between Algeria and France.
     It is, in any event, common ground that he is not a person  of  truth,
    though there is clear disagreement as to the reasons for this.  For the
    applicant it is argued that these answers can be explained on the basis
    that he is a victim of trafficking; for the  respondent  it  is  argued
    that they are evidence of a person older than he claims to  be  who  is
    lying about his age.  These matters will require to  be  factored  into
    the overall assessment.

171. As I stated earlier on, I consider that particular significance  is  to
    be attached to the view of the professionals  in  this  case  who  have
    given evidence as to the claimed age.  I start with the evidence of  Mr
    Coulson.

172.     Mr Coulson has a good  deal  of  relevant  experience  as  set  out
    above, taken from his witness statement  and  his  oral  evidence.   He
    observed the applicant on a very regular basis between 11 January  2013
    and 17 April.  He observed him interacting with  other  people  in  the
    same age group and among other things developed concerns as to  whether
    or not he had been trafficked.  I find Mr  Coulson  to  be  a  credible
    witness, subject to the minor caveat that he was  reluctant  to  accept
    the implications of the applicant not being identified  in  the  French
    system.  His experience shone through, and  he  provided  balanced  and
    clear answer to the questions he was asked.  His view as  expressed  in
    the witness statement was that he and  his  colleagues  who  had  daily
    contact with the applicant believed him to be a minor  not  much  older
    than his claimed age of 16.  In his  oral  evidence  he  said  that  he
    thought he was 16 or  17  perhaps,  and  felt  very  confident,  though
    properly not 100% sure, in that assessment.   Clearly  weight  must  be
    attached to his views.

173. Likewise Debra Francis was a careful and credible witness.   She  again
    has significant experience of young people in the applicant's age range
    and she was involved with him prior to taking over from Mr  Coulson  in
    mid-April and had seen him every day since, presumably other  than  the
    time he was  in  the  young  offenders'  institution.   Again  she  has
    observed the applicant in the context of other young people between the
    ages of 16 to 21, as well as attending meetings with him and seeing him
    daily, between ten minutes to half an hour as she said at  paragraph  6
    of here statement,  depending  on  the  situation.   She  said  in  her
    statement that nothing in her dealings with him indicated to  her  that
    he was an adult.  She estimated him as being 16 or 17 and was not  sure
    she would go as far as 18,  given  his  needs.   Like  Mr  Coulson  her
    comments were evidence-based and, in my  view,  objective.   Again  her
    evidence deserves significant weight to be attached to it.

174.     Mr Shamuyarira of course has had much less time in the  company  of
    the applicant.  He spent about an hour and  a  half  with  him  and  he
    thought he was in the 16 to 18 age range.  Given his experience this is
    again relevant evidence, though  it  does  not  have  the  same  weight
    attached to it as that of Mr Coulson and Ms Francis  given  the  lesser
    period of time he spent with the applicant.

175. Mr Brown saw the applicant on average once every  two  or  three  weeks
    between November 2012 and mid-February 2013.  He was not in a  position
    where he observed him regularly in the company of other young people of
    his age and he has significantly less experience than Mr Coulson and Ms
    Francis.  This was his first age assessment, and of course there always
    has to be a first age assessment, and wisely it was done in the company
    of a more experienced colleague, though unfortunately we  do  not  have
    the notes of his colleague Mr Mannan and he did not give evidence.

176. It seems that Mr Brown's view of the applicant's  age  earlier  on  was
    that it was  between  17  and  18  and  this  changed  during  the  age
    assessment interview process to the conclusion that  he  was  aged  20.
    This was of course a view  that  he  reached  in  conjunction  with  Mr
    Mannan.  I have referred above to the various factors set  out  in  the
    age assessment which led Mr Brown to  conclude  as  he  did  about  the
    applicant's age.  Some of these are clearly more weighty  than  others.
    A matter of  concern  must  be  Mr  Brown's  point  that  the  majority
    consensus among the  professionals  who  had  been  involved  with  the
    applicant was that he  was  older  than  the  age  he  claimed  to  be.
    Certainly the foster carer who  looked  after  the  applicant  for  two
    months believed he was age 20 or older.  However,  we  do  not  have  a
    statement from her, and she did not give oral  evidence  and  therefore
    her evidence was not tested under  cross-examination.   Her  basis  for
    concluding  that  the  applicant  was  20  appears  therefore  somewhat
    unclear.  Otherwise there are the points set out at paragraph 7  of  Mr
    Buttler's closing submission.  The first of these confirms the view  of
    the Magistrates' Court.  As he notes, a Magistrates' Court  is  obliged
    to come to a view of the age of a young person and it accepted  he  was
    13.  Clearly, even on the applicant's evidence as it now is,  that  was
    wrong, but it is nevertheless not a view that  he  was  older  than  he
    claimed to be.  The police view, as set out in document 1 of  the  slim
    bundle was that he appeared to be 16  to  18.   The  YOT  in  the  same
    document said that on observation he did not look 13 years of  age  and
    would suggest 16+, potentially an adult.  The  doctor  at  the  Looked-
    After Child medical review thought that he was between 16 and  18.   As
    is said  in  Mr  Buttler's  closing  submissions,  the  contemporaneous
    document must be the best evidence on the point rather than Mr  Brown's
    recollection of what was said.  The  child  protection  medical  report
    expressed the medical opinion that the applicant was a 16 year old boy.
     Again there is no contemporaneous evidence to support Mr Brown's claim
    that the doctor indicated that he was 18.  So some of  the  details  at
    paragraph 13 of the conclusions of the age assessment are not accurate.
     In particular what is said there about the doctor who carried out  the
    Looked-After Child medical examination, the YOT worker's view  and  the
    Chelsea  and   Westminster   Hospital   doctor   is   incorrect.    The
    disappearance of both the matrix prepared by Mr Brown, and Mr  Mannan's
    handwritten notes is also troubling.

177. I have thus some concerns about  Mr  Brown's  evidence.   A  particular
    matter of concern must be the fact that he sought to resile  from  what
    he had said in the statutory referral where it was  said  that  it  was
    felt the applicant might be aged between 17 and 18.   Mr  Brown  signed
    this document confirming that  the  information  he  had  provided  was
    correct.  On the second day when he gave oral  evidence  he  sought  to
    resile from this on the basis that he  had  been  anxious  to  get  the
    applicant into the Cardinal Hume Centre and  wanted  to  make  sure  he
    would get there by giving  an  age  assessment  that  fell  comfortably
    within the ages of those who are in that centre.  If he was not of  the
    view that the applicant might be aged between 17 and 18  at  that  time
    then it is a matter of concern that he was prepared to sign a statutory
    declaration that the contents of the document were true.  If he was  of
    that view then it requires some explanation in light of the  subsequent
    view reached that the applicant was in fact 20.  The matter may perhaps
    be explained on the basis that Mr Brown's view of the  applicant's  age
    continued to evolve during the time when he saw him  and  the  ultimate
    conclusion that he was 20 was one arrived at at the conclusion  of  the
    age assessment interviews.  However, that is as I say a matter of  some
    concern, as is the fact that at paragraph 13 of the summary to the  age
    assessment he appears to have misstated somewhat the views of  some  of
    the professionals who had given views as to the applicant's age.   And,
    of course, his mistaken view as to what they said may  have  influenced
    his subsequent conclusion as to the applicant's age.

178. I must bring all these matters together and come  to  a  conclusion  on
    the issue before me.  The applicant is a person who lacks  credibility.
    I do not think that it can be said simply that anything in his evidence
    that is untrue or inconsistent can be explained away by the  fact  that
    he may have been trafficked.  All that has been done so far is  that  a
    recommendation has been made that it be considered to see if there  are
    reasonable grounds to assess that he has been trafficked.   As  I  said
    when refusing the adjournment request, it is not known whether he  will
    be referred and it is not known what, if anything, he would say  during
    the period of recovery and reflection.  And in any event what he had to
    say at such a time would have to be set  against  his  other  evidence.
    So, although there is no basis for me to factor in any views of my  own
    on the applicant's appearance and demeanour, I think it has to be taken
    into consideration in this case that on material aspects of  his  claim
    he has told untruths and these must be taken into account.

179.  This  has  to  be  seen  in  the  context  of  the  evidence  of   the
    professionals who have observed the applicant.  The essential consensus
    of those to whose evidence the greatest weight must be attached is that
    he is somewhere in the 16  to  18  range.   I  find  it  impossible  to
    conclude that the applicant is the age he has claimed  to  be.   If  he
    were, then that information would have led to his identification by the
    French authorities.  I am satisfied that whatever age he is, he was not
    born on 27 December 1996.  It is however a date of birth  that  he  has
    constantly asserted when he was claiming to be 13 and when he wished to
    be regarded as 21, and for what it is worth it  is  also  the  date  of
    birth that his mother gave for him.  Doing the  best  I  can  with  the
    evidence I have, I have concluded that his date  of  birth  was,  on  a
    balance of probabilities, 27 December  1995  which  means  that  he  is
    currently 17 years and some seven months old.
