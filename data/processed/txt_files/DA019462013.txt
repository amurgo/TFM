Representation:

For the Appellant (Secretary of State): Mr T Wilding, Home Office
Presenting Officer
For the Respondent (Mr Cassama): Ms C Robinson, Counsel instructed by
Birnberg Peirce & Partners


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal brought by the Secretary of State against a  decision
    of a panel of the First-tier Tribunal consisting of First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Petherbridge and Mrs S A  Hussain  JP,  non-legal  member.   This
    determination was promulgated on 27 March 2014 following a  hearing  at
    Taylor House on 19 March 2014.  For ease of reference I shall refer  to
    the Secretary of State,  who  was  the  original  respondent,  as  "the
    Secretary of State" and to Mr Cassama, who was the original  appellant,
    as "the claimant".

 2. This appeal was last before me on 16 May 2014 when  I  found  that  the
    determination of the panel had contained an error of law such that  the
    decision had to be set aside and remade by this Tribunal.

 3. I set out my reasons within  the  decision  which  I  gave  immediately
    following that hearing and it is necessary for  the  purposes  of  this
    determination to repeat much of what was contained within that decision
    which I shall now do.

 4. The claimant is a citizen of Portugal and of the European Union who was
    born on 28 July 1989.  He arrived in this country in June 2012  but  in
    or about March 2013 he  was  arrested  and  subsequently  charged  with
    conspiracy to supply a class A drug (said to be cocaine) and conspiracy
    to supply a class  B  drug,  cannabis.   He  pleaded  guilty  to  these
    offences and was sentenced  to  concurrent  sentences  of  imprisonment
    amounting to twelve months' imprisonment.

 5. I should state because this is clear from the sentencing remarks of the
    judge who sentenced the claimant  that  the  charge  of  conspiracy  to
    supply a class A drug should have been amended  because  his  plea  was
    accepted (and he was sentenced) on the basis that the  substance  which
    he had supplied to the undercover policeman who  subsequently  arrested
    him was not in fact cocaine but was a combination  of  paracetamol  and
    caffeine.  It was accepted that the claimant and his co-conspirator  at
    all times knew this and so effectively what they were engaged upon  was
    a fraud upon potential customers who wished to purchase cocaine because
    they would be taking money from these people but supplying a relatively
    harmless product.

 6. Following his conviction the  Secretary  of  State  considered,  having
    regard to Regulation 21(5)(d) of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006, that  the  personal  conduct  of  the  claimant
    represented a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat such  as
    to justify his deportation and  accordingly  decided  under  Regulation
    19(3)(b) that he should be removed.  An order was  thereafter  made  in
    accordance with Regulation 24(3) requiring  him  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom and prohibiting him from re-entering while  the  order  was  in
    force.

 7. The Secretary of State's decision, which was made after she had written
    to the claimant notifying him that she was considering his  deportation
    and seeking reasons  why  he  should  not  be  deported  following  his
    conviction, was set out in a letter dated 7 October 2013 following  the
    representations which the claimant had made.

 8. The claimant appealed against this decision and his appeal was heard by
    the panel, whose composition was as noted above, on 19 March 2014,  and
    in a determination promulgated on 27 March 2014 the panel  allowed  the
    claimant's appeal both under the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 and also on human rights grounds Article 8.

 9. As already noted above the Secretary of  State  appealed  against  this
    decision and permission to appeal was granted by Designated  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Dearden on 16 April 2014.   The  basis  upon  which  the
    appeal was made was set out in the Secretary of State's grounds and was
    essentially that the panel considered that it  was  a  relevant  factor
    that the claimant's prospects of rehabilitation were high.

10. It was argued in the grounds that this was contrary to the decision  of
    the European Court of Justice in Tsakouridis [2011] CMLR 11  where  the
    Court of Justice had found that the  term  "genuinely  integrated"  was
    appropriate to describe those for whom the prospects of  rehabilitation
    were a relevant issue, but that European nationals could  not  properly
    be said to be integrated until they had acquired a right  of  permanent
    residence in another member state in the European Union, which  it  was
    accepted that this claimant had not (he had not even been here for  two
    years, seven months of which he had spent in prison).

11. At the earlier hearing the Secretary of State relied  on  the  reported
    presidential   decision   of    this    Tribunal    in    Essa    (EEA:
    rehabilitation/integration) [2013] UKUT 00316 in which at paragraph  26
    the Tribunal had found as follows:

         "26. We agree that the court's reference (that is  in  Tsakouridis)
             to genuine integration must be directed at  qualified  persons
             and other family members who have resided in the host state as
             such for five years or more.  People who have just arrived  in
             the host state, have not yet become qualified persons, or  who
             have not been a qualified person for five years, can always be
             removed   [for]   non-exercise   of   free   movement   rights
             irrespective of public good grounds to curtail  free  movement
             rights.  If their presence  during  this  time  makes  them  a
             present threat to public policy it would be inconsistent  with
             the purposes of the Directive to weigh in the balance  against
             deportation their future prospects of rehabilitation."

12. As I set out in my previous decision, although it was apparent from the
    panel's determination which had taken a generally positive view of  the
    claimant, Mr Wilding (representing  the  Secretary  of  State  at  this
    hearing as well as the present) nonetheless submitted  that  the  panel
    had  not  considered  this  appeal  properly  in  the  context  of  the
    Regulations.  So where for example at paragraph 68 of its determination
    the panel stated that "the Tribunal took the view  that  the  appellant
    did not present a threat to  public  policy"  it  went  on  to  say  as
    follows:

         "... and there were factors relevant to integration that  suggested
         that there were reasonable prospects of his  rehabilitation.   That
         being  so  that  factor  has  to  be  taken  into  account  in  the
         proportionality balance as to whether a deportation order would not
         be justified."

13. Mr Wilding's submission effectively was of the use of the term  "public
    policy" in this context which had implicit within  it  the  concept  of
    immigration and rehabilitation, which was not appropriate in  the  case
    of a person who had not acquired permanent residence.  He referred also
    to other passages within the determination  in  order  to  support  his
    argument that the first part of the sentence in paragraph 68 could  not
    be considered in isolation.

14. Having considered the arguments advanced on behalf of both parties (and
    as I noted in my earlier decision with some regret) I decided  that  Mr
    Wilding's submissions had sufficient force that  the  determination  of
    the panel had to be set aside.

15. I considered that in the first  place  the  bold  statement  that  "the
    Tribunal took the view that the appellant would not present a threat to
    public policy" was on its face clearly unjustifiable.  On any  view  he
    presented a threat of some sort; he had been  convicted  of  a  serious
    offence, and even though the assessment of the Probation Service in the
    NOMS 1 assessment was that he "posed a low risk  upon  members  of  the
    public" a low risk is still a risk.

16. Moreover and more importantly perhaps in the context of this  case,  at
    paragraph 69 the panel had stated as follows:

         "69. The Tribunal took  the  view  that  the  appellant  would  not
             constitute a present threat when rehabilitated  [my  emphasis]
             and that his rehabilitation was well-advanced and there  is  a
             substantial degree of integration to a point where we consider
             it would be disproportionate for the respondent to proceed  to
             deport the appellant."

17. I decided that to take the view that he would not then [my emphasis] be
    a "present threat" when rehabilitated did not make sense because it was
    using the term "present threat" to describe what the position would  be
    in the future, whereas the issue before the panel was whether or not at
    the time of the  decision  he  constituted  a  "present  threat".   The
    question  the  panel  should  have  asked  itself  was  whether  having
    considered all the evidence and made findings regarding  this  evidence
    this claimant represented "a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious
    [again my emphasis] threat affecting one of the  fundamental  interests
    of society" (as set out in Regulation 21(5)(c) of the EEA Regulations).

18. If the panel's finding was that he did not, then his removal could  not
    be justified under the Regulations.  It was only if he did represent  a
    "genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of  the
    fundamental interests of society" that his removal could be justified.

19. Although I considered  that  had  the  panel  asked  itself  the  right
    question it might very well still have allowed this claimant's  appeal,
    I nonetheless found that by reason of its failure  to  ask  itself  the
    correct question the panel's decision was not  properly  reasoned,  and
    that accordingly the decision would have to be remade.

20. Because it was not possible for  the  decision  to  be  remade  at  the
    previous hearing without this Tribunal hearing further evidence  (which
    could not be done on that  occasion)  I  was  obliged  to  adjourn  the
    hearing until today's date.  I made it clear in my  decision  that  the
    issue which would have to be considered by this Tribunal was whether or
    not the personal conduct of this claimant now represented  a  "genuine,
    present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting   one   of   the
    fundamental interests of  society"  such  that  his  removal  would  be
    justified.

21. I gave various directions for  the  rehearing  which  I  shall  discuss
    briefly in a moment.



The Hearing

22. One of the important directions which I gave was that:

         "The claimant will prepare and file with the Tribunal and serve  on
         the Secretary of State by no later than Monday 30 June a  paginated
         bundle containing all the documents relevant to this appeal"

    and that "this bundle must contain in respect of every  witness  it  is
    intended shall give evidence a witness statement capable of standing as
    evidence-in-chief."

23. I also recorded that the Tribunal would take account  of  the  findings
    made by the panel at paragraphs 66, 67, 71 and 72 of the determination.

24. I set out these paragraphs now:

         "66. We had the opportunity of seeing the appellant and his partner
             both give evidence and we were impressed by their  genuineness
             and honesty and their  genuine  desire  to  live  their  lives
             together  supported  by  other  members  of  their  respective
             families who had attended the Tribunal  to  give  evidence  in
             support of the appellant and his appeal.

         67.  These members of  the  family  included  his  mother,  younger
             brother and his partner.  We were also referred  to  a  letter
             from the appellant's employment coach, Mr Richard Learthart of
             12 March 2014  who  confirmed  that  the  appellant  had  been
             meeting him every few weeks to search for jobs and further his
             career.  In that letter, Mr Learthart says  of  the  appellant
             that '[he] is always a pleasure to  meet  with,  and  is  pro-
             active and keen to get into full-time sustainable employment'.
              That was very much the impression that we were left  with  on
             hearing the oral evidence of the appellant and  other  members
             of his family.

         ...

         71.  We accept  that  the  appellant  now  very  much  regrets  his
             criminal offending and we found his remorse  genuine  in  that
             regard particularly with regard to the impact that had had  on
             his mother, sister and younger brother.

         72.  We accept that the appellant is now in the throes of  changing
             his life.  He has settled into a  state  of  some  domesticity
             with his new partner and her 2 year old son."

25. Regrettably, notwithstanding the direction  that  the  claimant  should
    prepare and file with the Tribunal and serve on the Secretary of  State
    by no longer than Monday 13 June the paginated bundle  referred  to  in
    the directions (in the knowledge that  the  resumed  hearing  would  be
    listed before me today) this direction was not complied  with,  and  it
    was not until 9 July, some two days ago, that this bundle  was  served.
    At the end of this bundle  was  a  skeleton  argument  which  had  been
    prepared by  Ms  Robinson,  Counsel,  who  is  again  representing  the
    claimant.  The effect of this was that I did not  receive  this  bundle
    (including the skeleton argument) until about five minutes  before  the
    hearing and consequently about 40  minutes  of  time  was  wasted  this
    morning because it was necessary for  me  to  read  and  consider  this
    bundle whereas had it been served properly in time  the  hearing  could
    have commenced at 10.00am as it should.

26. This does not appear to have been the fault in any way of Ms  Robinson,
    and I was told that it was as a result of funding difficulties  because
    the claimant is not legally aided and out of what  are  no  doubt  very
    limited resources has had to pay for his own representation.   However,
    I do not regard this as a proper justification for the  directions  not
    being properly complied with.

27. It makes it very difficult for this Tribunal to  prepare  properly  for
    appeals if directions which are given with the aim  of  the  swift  and
    efficient despatch of the Tribunal's business are not properly complied
    with.  The claimant's solicitors are  very  experienced  and  know  how
    important it is that directions are complied with and at the very least
    if there was a problem this Tribunal should have been notified earlier,
    which it was not.

28. It is also the case of course that the bundle was  not  served  on  the
    Secretary of State either until very late but  fortunately  Mr  Wilding
    with his typical efficiency was able to  prepare  the  case  fully  and
    properly notwithstanding the delay in serving the file  upon  him,  and
    did not seek to take any point with regard to late service.

29. At the hearing before me  I  heard  evidence  from  the  claimant,  his
    partner Ms Loforte, and the claimant's mother Ms Braganca.  In  respect
    of the claimant and his partner they gave evidence  mainly  in  English
    but from time  to  time  where  necessary  they  were  assisted  by  an
    interpreter who translated the proceedings to them  in  Portuguese  and
    translated their answers back to the  Tribunal,  both  these  witnesses
    having told the Tribunal that they and the interpreter understood  each
    other.

30. In respect of the  claimant's  mother,  the  third  witness,  she  gave
    evidence entirely in Portuguese with the assistance of the interpreter,
    as she understood very little  English.   I  was  also  assisted  by  a
    statement made on behalf of the claimant by his brother Helder.  He was
    unable to give oral evidence before me at the hearing today because  he
    was as I understood in the middle of GCSEs and so could not be present.

31. I also heard submissions which were made on behalf of both parties  and
    was greatly assisted also by  the  skeleton  argument  which  had  been
    prepared on behalf of the claimant by Ms  Robinson  and  given  to  her
    solicitors last Tuesday (three days ago) but  which  as  I  have  noted
    above I did not see until five minutes before the  hearing.   It  is  a
    pity I did not see this document earlier but even though it was late  I
    have found it extremely helpful and I should record  also  that  I  was
    greatly assisted in the consideration of this appeal by the  very  high
    quality of the submissions made to me on behalf of both parties.

32. I recorded the evidence of the witnesses (who were all  cross-examined)
    and the submissions contemporaneously and as  my  notes  are  contained
    within the Record of Proceedings I shall not set out  below  everything
    which was said  to  me  either  by  the  witnesses  or  the  respective
    representatives, but shall refer only to such of the evidence  and  the
    submissions as is necessary for the purposes of this determination.   I
    have, however, had regard to everything which was said to me during the
    course of the hearing as well as to all the documents contained  within
    the file whether or not the same is specifically set out  and  recorded
    below.

33. As I have set out above the main issue in this appeal is whether or not
    the personal conduct  of  this  claimant  now  represents  a  "genuine,
    present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting   one   of   the
    fundamental interests of  society"  such  that  his  removal  would  be
    justified.  It is helpful if I set out  briefly  the  legal  parameters
    within which the decision must be made.

34. The claimant being a European national who is exercising treaty  rights
    in this country his position is governed  by  Directive  2004/38/EC  as
    consolidated  within   the   Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
    Regulations 2006 as amended.  The purpose of the Directive is to ensure
    as a general principle the free movement of citizens  of  the  European
    Community within the area of the Community and at Chapter VI  there  is
    provision with regard to "restrictions on the right of  entry  and  the
    right of residence on grounds of  public  policy,  public  security  or
    public  health".   The  Directive  sets  out  the  general   principles
    contained within Article 27 of the treaty as follows:

         "1.  Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, member  states  may
             restrict the  freedom  of  movement  and  residence  of  Union
             citizens   and   their   family   members,   irrespective   of
             nationality, on grounds of public policy, public  security  or
             public health.  These grounds shall not be  invoked  to  serve
             economic ends.

         2.   Measures taken on grounds of public policy or public  security
             shall comply with the principle of proportionality  and  shall
             be based exclusively on the personal conduct of the individual
             concerned.   Previous  criminal  convictions  shall   not   in
             themselves constitute grounds for taking such measures.

             The  personal  conduct  of  the  individual   concerned   must
             represent a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat
             affecting  one  of  the  fundamental  interests  of   society.
             Justifications that are isolated from the particulars  of  the
             case or that rely  on  considerations  of  general  prevention
             shall not be accepted.

         ..."

35. The Directive then deals with Article 28 "protection against expulsion"
    as follows:

         "1.  Before taking an  expulsion  decision  on  grounds  of  public
             policy or public security, the host member  state  shall  take
             account of considerations such  as  how  long  the  individual
             concerned has resided on its territory, his/her age, state  of
             health, family and economic  situation,  social  and  cultural
             integration into the host  member  state  and  the  extent  of
             his/her links with the country of origin.

         2.   The host member state  may  not  take  an  expulsion  decision
             against Union citizens or their family  members,  irrespective
             of nationality, who have the right of permanent  residence  on
             its territory, except on serious grounds of public  policy  or
             public security..."

36. With regard to 2. above, it is accepted on behalf of the claimant  that
    he has not acquired the  right  of  permanent  residence  and  so  this
    provision does not apply.

37. The relevant provisions of the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 are as follows.

         "Exclusion and removal from the United Kingdom

         19.(1)   A person is not entitled to  be  admitted  to  the  United
                Kingdom by virtue of  Regulation  11  if  his  exclusion  is
                justified on grounds of public policy,  public  security  or
                public health in accordance with Regulation 21.

         ...

           (3)    Subject to paragraphs (4) and (5), an  EEA  national  who
                has entered the United Kingdom or the family member of  such
                a national who has entered the United Kingdom may be removed
                if -

                ...

                (b)    the Secretary of State has decided that the  person's
                    removal is justified on grounds of public policy, public
                    security or public health in accordance with  Regulation
                    21.

         ...

         Decisions taken on public policy, public security and public health
         grounds

         21 (1)   In this Regulation a  'relevant  decision'  means  an  EEA
                decision taken on  the  grounds  of  public  policy,  public
                security or public health.

           (2)    A relevant decision may not be taken  to  serve  economic
                ends.

           (3)    A relevant decision may not be  taken  in  respect  of  a
                person with a permanent right of residence under  Regulation
                15 except on serious grounds  of  public  policy  or  public
                security.  [As already noted above this sub-section does not
                apply in respect of this claimant, who has  not  acquired  a
                permanent right of residence].

           ...

           (5)    Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds  of  public
                policy or public security it shall, in addition to complying
                with the preceding paragraphs of this Regulation,  be  taken
                in accordance with the following principles -

                (a)    the  decision  must  comply  with  the  principle  of
                    proportionality;

                (b)     the  decision  must  be  based  exclusively  on  the
                    personal conduct of the person concerned;

                (c)    the personal conduct of  the  person  concerned  must
                    represent a genuine, present  and  sufficiently  serious
                    threat affecting one of  the  fundamental  interests  of
                    society;

                (d)    matters isolated from the particulars of the case  or
                    which relate to considerations of general prevention  do
                    not justify the decision;

                (e)    a person's previous criminal convictions  do  not  in
                    themselves justify the decision.

           (6)    Before taking a  relevant  decision  on  the  grounds  of
                public policy or public security in relation to a person who
                is resident in the United Kingdom  the  decision-maker  must
                take account of considerations such as  the  age,  state  of
                health, family and economic situation  of  the  person,  the
                person's length of residence  in  the  United  Kingdom,  the
                person's social and cultural  integration  into  the  United
                Kingdom and the  extent  of  the  person's  links  with  his
                country of origin..."

38. It is not a matter of dispute between the  parties  that  although  the
    courts have made it clear that in the case of  a  non-EU  national  the
    deportation of a "foreign  criminal"  who  has  been  convicted  of  an
    offence for which he has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of
    more than twelve months is by the  will  of  Parliament  deemed  to  be
    conducive  to  the  public  good  and  in  the  public  interest  these
    provisions do not apply to  the  same  extent  with  regard  to  an  EU
    national.  This is because the Regulations as consolidated  within  the
    2006 EEA Regulations make it clear that a  decision-maker  cannot  take
    into account the deterrent effect of  such  a  sentence  on  others  or
    indeed give expression to the revulsion felt by members of  the  public
    towards people who commit serious criminal offences.

39. So while it would be right to say that there is a wider public interest
    to which the courts must give effect with regard  to  non-EU  nationals
    who commit serious criminal offences which includes deterrence and  the
    revulsion felt towards serious criminality  by  the  public  generally,
    these are factors which cannot be taken into account when dealing  with
    an EU national.  Were this claimant not an EU  national,  in  light  of
    current jurisprudence this Tribunal would be unlikely to find that  the
    reasons why he should not be deported are  sufficiently  compelling  as
    would justify it in finding,  exceptionally,  that  he  should  not  be
    deported.  However, that is not the test that I  have  to  consider  in
    this case.  As I have already stated the only  issue,  as  set  out  in
    Regulation  21(5)(c)  of  the  2006  EEA  Regulations,  is  whether  he
    represents  "a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently   serious   threat
    affecting one of the fundamental interests of society".

40. I do not intend to set out the evidence of the witnesses  in  full.   I
    should, however, state that I was very impressed in particular with the
    evidence of the claimant's partner, who clearly  does  not  attempt  to
    play down the seriousness of the offence  of  which  the  claimant  was
    convicted and understands that this sort of offending cannot be  either
    condoned or tolerated in this or any other civilised country.

41. I was also impressed notwithstanding the  arguments  to  which  I  will
    refer briefly below regarding the breaches of the strict terms  of  the
    claimant's bail conditions with the claimant's sincerity with regard to
    his determination not to offend again in the future.  In this regard  I
    should set out the most up-to-date report from the  Surrey  and  Sussex
    Probation Trust dated 17 March 2014 which was after  the  claimant  had
    completed a supervision licence period and which provides as follows:

         "Further to my letter of 12 March 2014 concerning  [the  claimant].
         I can  confirm  that  [the  claimant]  successfully  completed  his
         supervision licence period attended on 13 March 2014.  During  this
         period he was not recalled to prison nor was he  charged  with  any
         further offences.

         At completion of his supervision period using  the  SSPT  probation
         assessment  tools  [the  claimant]  is  assessed  as  low  risk  of
         reoffending and low risk of serious harm.

         During the period of supervision [the  claimant]  has  successfully
         undertaken  offence-focused  work   and   work   to   address   his
         criminogenic needs.  In undertaking such work  [the  claimant]  has
         been able [to] identify areas of his life he would like to  improve
         and put in place plans to achieve those goals."

42. Having heard the evidence given by the witnesses, even had the findings
    of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  panel  not   been   retained   I   would
    independently have made similar findings as that panel made.   That  is
    to say, I would have found and  do  find  that  the  claimant  and  his
    partner were both genuine and honest in the desire  they  expressed  to
    live their lives together supported by the members of their  respective
    families and also that the claimant  very  much  regrets  his  criminal
    offending now and that the remorse which he has expressed is genuine.

43. It is unfortunate that  the  evidence  of  the  claimant's  mother  was
    inconsistent to at least some extent with the statement which  she  had
    prepared earlier because she told the Tribunal that she  had  not  been
    informed before she had arrived in this country that the  claimant  had
    been arrested for the offences to which he later pleaded guilty and did
    not discover this until she came whereas in her statement she had  said
    that she flew back to the UK when she found out that her son  had  been
    arrested "as he needed me on his side, and I  needed  to  be  with  him
    too".  It may be, as I think she tried to explain, that what she  meant
    to say was that although she did not have specific  knowledge  that  he
    had been arrested she knew that something was wrong because her son  to
    whom she was very close had stopped telephoning her or it may  be  that
    her statement was  an  overenthusiastic  attempt  to  assist  her  son.
    Whichever it is, this factor was not central in this case and does  not
    impact on my judgment as to whether  there  is  a  real  risk  of  this
    claimant reoffending.

44. What is potentially more serious and was relied upon by Mr Wilding  was
    the fact that even though it was a condition  of  the  claimant's  bail
    that he resided at an address in Hastings which he had given previously
    to the Secretary of State, he did not strictly abide by  the  terms  of
    his bail but firstly moved during the week for substantial  periods  of
    time to live with his sister  in  Pimlico  and  secondly  moved  to  an
    address in London without formally  obtaining  a  change  in  his  bail
    conditions.

45. It is argued on behalf of the Secretary of State that this  shows  that
    the claimant is still motivated by the desire to improve  his  economic
    wellbeing even if this involves him in lawbreaking (in this case by not
    abiding by his bail conditions) which was what  had  motivated  him  to
    commit the offences in the first place.

46. Mr Wilding also has commented on the failure of the  claimant's  sister
    to provide a witness  statement  on  his  behalf  because  clearly  her
    evidence could have been relevant to the precise circumstances in which
    the bail conditions were not kept.  He even went as far as  to  suggest
    to the claimant in cross-examination (as he was entitled to do  because
    the purpose of  cross-examination  is  to  test  the  evidence  of  the
    witnesses) that this may have been because  the  claimant's  sister  no
    longer wished to have anything to do with him because she could not put
    up with the way in which he was behaving.

47. With regard to the latter argument, that is regarding the sister, I  do
    take into account that it may have been preferable for a  statement  to
    be prepared but it is also clear that this case has not  been  prepared
    with the thoroughness and attention to detail  that  I  would  normally
    expect from the solicitors who have  been  representing  the  claimant.
    Clearly there was a funding issue, and as I  have  already  noted,  had
    this case been prepared entirely as it ought the directions which I had
    given previously would have been complied with.

48. It is also the case that there  were  in  any  event  potentially  four
    witnesses who were going to give evidence on behalf of the claimant and
    although, as it turned out, the breach of the  bail  conditions  was  a
    relevant  or  potentially  relevant  factor  this  may  not  have  been
    immediately apparent.  Also, as I  shall  briefly  discuss  below,  the
    claimant's solicitors had received  some  instructions  to  attempt  to
    regularise his position.

49. My finding with regard to the issue of the breach of bail conditions is
    that although the claimant should have ensured that  the  position  was
    regularised properly I do not regard  this  as  more  than  a  marginal
    (albeit slightly more than technical) breach.  It was  clear  following
    investigation  (which  included  Ms   Robinson   obtaining   up-to-date
    instructions from her instructing solicitors) that the issue of whether
    or not the claimant would remain in Hastings or move to London had been
    canvassed to the extent that the  solicitors  had  been  instructed  to
    advise as to how bail conditions could be changed.  It is also the case
    that at some stage before he moved to London the claimant told the Home
    Office that he was intending to do so and asked what documents would be
    required.

50. This not a case where  the  Secretary  of  State  discovered  that  the
    claimant had been in breach of bail conditions  and  then  brought  the
    matter before the court but was one where the claimant openly told  the
    court what he had done and explained why he had  done  it,  and  indeed
    there is also an application before me today to vary the terms  of  the
    bail to regularise his position, albeit that  this  application  should
    have been made at a much earlier time.   The  reason  advanced  by  the
    claimant in evidence (during which he accepted that he knew that he was
    at the very least in technical breach of the terms  of  his  bail)  was
    that he could not get any work in Hastings and needed to move to London
    to get work and did not wish to continue to be a drain on public funds.

51. The position now is that he earns about �1,200 to �1,300  a  month  net
    and his partner, who has a son aged about 2, earns about �700  a  month
    working part-time.  So between them the  couple  earn  about  �2,000  a
    month and are able also between them to look after Nathan, Ms Loforte's
    young son.

52. During the course of their evidence I was told,  in  particular  by  Ms
    Loforte, how much worse the lives of this couple would be were they  to
    move back to Portugal and I have noted this evidence, because there  is
    a proportionality exercise which would have to be carried out,  were  I
    to be of the view that the threat of this  claimant  reoffending  is  a
    sufficiently serious threat as would absent other factors  justify  his
    expulsion.

53.  Having  considered  all  the  factors  very  carefully,  including  in
    particular the factors set out at Regulation 21(5) and (6) of the  2006
    EEA Regulations, I am firmly of  the  view  (considering  the  position
    today as I must and not at some future date  when  the  claimant  might
    become rehabilitated) that this claimant does not present  "a  genuine,
    present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting   one   of   the
    fundamental interests of society".  As I have already noted above, that
    is the only basis upon which his expulsion could be justified  as  this
    Tribunal or any decision-maker may not in the case of an  EEA  national
    take into account the deterrent effect that the expulsion of people who
    commit offences such as this claimant committed might have.   I  accept
    as did the panel below that this claimant's remorse is genuine.

54. I do not consider that the fact that there were what I have found to be
    marginal breaches of his bail conditions indicates that the  claimant's
    remorse is not genuine.  I do not regard  these  breaches  as  anywhere
    near as serious as dealing in drugs (or fraudulently pretending to deal
    in Class A drugs) and I do not accept the submission made on behalf  of
    the Secretary of State that this  shows  that  the  claimant  would  do
    whatever he had to do to make money if he did not have any.  It is  one
    thing wanting to move to London in order to work and look  after  one's
    family without ensuring first that  the  paperwork  has  been  properly
    completed as it ought but quite a different and far more serious matter
    engaging in real criminality in order to provide an income.   The  fact
    that he did the former is not in my  judgment  an  indication  that  he
    would be inclined to do the latter.  Although there was more  than  one
    offence committed, the time frame was small and this is the only period
    during which this claimant has ever been involved  in  criminality  (of
    which the authorities are aware); I believe the claimant when he  tells
    the Tribunal that he realises that the effect of crime  is  prison  and
    absence from his family and that he means to  do  what  he  has  to  do
    (which is not to commit further offences) to ensure that he never  goes
    back there.

55. I would just add this.  The claimant has not been in this country  very
    long and he will have to  remain  in  this  country  exercising  treaty
    rights for several more years before he will acquire a permanent  right
    of residence and be considered to be integrated within British society;
    if he was to prove this Tribunal wrong by committing  further  offences
    it would be very hard for him to argue in the future that, having  been
    given this chance, he did not then  represent  a  sufficiently  serious
    present threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests  of  society
    such as to justify his removal.

56. Accordingly, the fact that this Tribunal makes the decision now that he
    does not represent such a sufficiently serious threat does not preclude
    another Tribunal finding in future in light of  any  further  offending
    that the decision of this Tribunal was with the  benefit  of  hindsight
    wrong.  However, because I do not consider for the reasons I have given
    that this claimant now represents such a serious threat  affecting  one
    of the fundamental interests of society that  his  expulsion  could  be
    justified, it follows that his appeal against the original decision  of
    the Secretary of State to deport him must be allowed  and  I  shall  so
    find.



Decision

I set aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  as  containing  a
material error of law and substitute the following decision:

The claimant's appeal against the decision of  the  Secretary  of  State  to
deport him is allowed.
