                         UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE JORDAN


                                   Between

                                Raja Umer Ali
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               The Secretary Of State For The Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The First-tier Tribunal Judge in  light  of  Sala  (EFMs:  Right  of
       Appeal) [2016] UKUT 0411 (1AC) decided  that  the  Tribunal  had  no
       jurisdiction.  Given that the Court of Appeal has  said  in  Khan  v
       Secretary of State for the Home Department & Anor  [2017]  EWCA  Civ
       1755 (09 November 2017)  that  Sala  (EFMs:  Right  of  Appeal)  was
       wrongly  decided,  we  now  know   the   First-tier   Tribunal   had
       jurisdiction to hear this appeal,
    2. Proposals were given by Upper Tribunal Judge  Blum  on  11  December
       2017 that the appeal be allowed; the determination of the First-tier
       Tribunal Judge be set aside and the appeal be remitted to the First-
       tier Tribunal for the decision to be re-made.
    3. Neither side has objected to that proposal.  Pursuant to Rule 34  of
       the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  I  make  this
       decision without a hearing.

DECISION

 1. The Judge made an error on a point of law and I set aside the
    determination.

 2. I direct that the appeal is re-made in the First-tier Tribunal.



                                                               ANDREW JORDAN
                                                 JUDGE OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
