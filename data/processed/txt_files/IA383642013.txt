For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, HOPO

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision of  Judge  Grimshaw
    made following a hearing at Bradford on 6th January 2014.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of India born on 17th April 1977.

 3. He has a lengthy immigration history.  He entered the UK  on  2nd  June
    2000 as a visitor using a forged passport in a false name  claiming  to
    be Rafick Wadee, a South African national.  Before his visa expired  he
    applied for, and was granted, leave to remain as a student  until  30th
    January 2002.  Further periods of leave as a student were  subsequently
    granted until 30th June 2009.  Since that time he has remained  in  the
    UK as an overstayer.

 4. In September 2006 the Appellant was given a certificate of approval  to
    marry Mrs Riaz, a British citizen, but the marriage did not take place.
     He married the Sponsor in this case, Jamila Wells Patel, on  27th  May
    2009 having been issued with a second certificate of approval in  March
    2009.  He then made an application for leave to remain as a  spouse  on
    17th September 2009 which was refused  on  21st  March  2010.   He  was
    served with illegal entrant papers on 26th February 2011 and placed  on
    reporting restrictions with which he failed to  comply.   He  filed  an
    application for JR on 10th April 2013 and by consent it was  agreed  on
    8th July 2013 that the Respondent would reconsider his case.

 5. On 2nd September 2013, the Respondent set out her reasons  for  refusal
    in the following terms. The letter acknowledged that the Appellant made
    an application for his case to be reconsidered under Article 8 ECHR  on
    2nd March 2009, 9th November 2009, 6th April 2010, 16th May 2011,  12th
    July 2011, 21st November 2012 and  24th  July  2013.   The  application
    could not succeed under paragraph 287 of the Immigration Rules  because
    the Appellant had not been granted admission to the UK with a  view  to
    settlement as the spouse of a person present and settled in the UK.  It
    was accepted that the  Appellant  intended  to  live  permanently  with
    Jamila Wells Patel but she had not provided evidence of her  employment
    and could not meet the maintenance and  accommodation  requirements  of
    the Rules.  Neither  had  he  demonstrated  knowledge  of  the  English
    language.

 6. The Respondent considered whether the  Appellant  could  succeed  under
    Article 8  with  respect  to  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    specifically in relation to family life with a partner and family  life
    as a parent.  It was not  accepted  that  he  could  succeed  under  R-
    LTRP.1.1  because, although the Appellant had a genuine and  subsisting
    relationship with a British partner, it was  not  accepted  that  there
    were insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner  outside
    the UK. He therefore did not meet the requirements under  paragraph  E-
    LTRP.1.2.

 7. Neither did he qualify for leave to remain as a parent under  paragraph
    E-LTRPT.2.2 because there was no evidence to suggest that it would  not
    be reasonable to expect the Appellant's two  daughters  and  a  son  to
    return to India with their step-father/ father and mother.

 8. The Respondent then considered paragraphs EX1 in the following way.  It
    was acknowledged that the children were born in the UK but there was no
    evidence to suggest that it would not be reasonable to expect  them  to
    return to India with their mother and remain as  a  family  unit.   The
    best interests of the children were considered and it was not sought to
    remove them from the UK.  The Appellant had  not  submitted  sufficient
    evidence to demonstrate that he had a relationship sufficient to engage
    Article 8 with his stepdaughter and daughter and son and had failed  to
    adequately substantiate how his proposed removal would adversely impact
    upon the children's wellbeing and  development.   The  Appellant  would
    have the opportunity to apply for entry clearance from abroad.

 9. The Appellant did not meet the requirements of  Rule  276ADE,  and  the
    Respondent did not accept that the existence of private and family life
    was a sufficiently compelling reason for making them  an  exception  to
    the normal practice of removing those  who  have  remained  in  the  UK
    unlawfully.

10. Finally, the letter cites paragraph 353B, which deals with fresh claims
    for asylum, and refers to  the  Appellant's  immigration  offences,  in
    particular obtaining leave using a forged  passport  and  entering  and
    remaining in the UK using a deceptive identity.

The Judge's Determination

11. The judge recorded that the Appellant had  no  prospect  of  succeeding
    under paragraph  287  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   He  submitted  his
    application in September 2009 when he had no leave and accordingly  had
    no in-country right of appeal against the adverse decision made by  the
    Respondent on 21st March 2010.  He did however have a right  of  appeal
    against the decision of 2nd September 2013 because he had made a  human
    rights  application  based  on  his  relationship  with  the  wife  and
    children.

12. The judge, in a careful determination, considered the factors in favour
    of the Appellant including the  significant  fact  that  he  had  joint
    parental responsibility for  three  young  children  who  were  British
    citizens and established in nursery and primary school education.   She
    said that it would be unreasonable to expect them to leave the  country
    of their birth for  a  country  which  was  unfamiliar  and  where  the
    standard of living would be poorer.  The  best  interests  of  all  the
    children were for the Appellant to remain in the UK so that they  could
    enjoy the benefit of family life together.

13. She nevertheless dismissed the appeal because  of  the  strong  factors
    relied upon by the Respondent i.e the Appellant's immigration  history,
    and  whilst  the  best  interests  of  the  children  were  a   primary
    consideration, they were not the sole primary consideration.  It  would
    not be unjustifiably  harsh  to  expect  Mrs  Wells  Patel  to  make  a
    matrimonial home with the Appellant and their children in India if  the
    couple wish to cohabit and  enjoy  family  life  without  a  period  of
    separation.



The Grounds of Appeal

14. The Appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had materially erred in law in  failing  to  consider  the  Appellant's
    claim in accordance with paragraph  EX1  of  the  Appendix  FM  to  the
    Immigration Rules, had conducted a flawed approach to Article 8 and had
    made perverse and  irrational  findings  on  matters  material  to  the
    outcome.

15. The findings in the determination at paragraphs 24 and 25, namely  that
    the Appellant was in a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  a
    British citizen and it would be  unreasonable  for  the  three  British
    children to leave the UK, established that the requirements of EX1  had
    been satisfied.

16. The judge had also erred in her consideration of Article  8  which  did
    not reflect a necessary, proportionate and  fair  balance  between  the
    Appellant and his children's rights  to  family  life  and  the  public
    interest.  There was no evidence that  the  judge  had  identified  the
    particular public interest in  question  and  had  not  considered  the
    relevant case law in  particular  EB  Kosovo  [2008]  UKHL  41  and  ZH
    Bangladesh [2009] EWCA Civ 818.

17. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge De Haney on 5th February 2014
    with respect to  paragraph  EX1  only.   He  stated  that  the  lengthy
    grounds, in the most part, amounted to no more than a disagreement with
    the findings of the judge.

Submissions

18. Ms Hasmi firstly submitted that the decision in Sabir  (Appendix  FM  -
    EX1 not freestanding) [2014] UKUT 00063,  was  wrongly  decided.  Sabir
    held that it was plain from the architecture of the  Rules  as  regards
    partners, that EX1 is parasitic on the relevant Rule within Appendix FM
    that otherwise grants leave to remain.   The  Appellant  in  that  case
    failed because he could not meet the requirements of  E-LTRP.2.1  since
    he had leave to remain in the UK as a visitor.

19. More profitably Ms Hasmi then submitted that Sabir was  distinguishable
    because there, the Appellant was unable to navigate his way through one
    of the alternative routes through R-LTRP, but in this case, he could.

20. She also sought to reopen her  grounds  with  respect  to  the  judge's
    consideration of Article 8.

21. Mr Diwnycz said that if the judge ought to  have  considered  paragraph
    EX1 then, on the basis  of  the  findings  of  the  judge,  Ms  Hasmi's
    submissions had force.

Findings and Conclusions

22. The relevant requirements of Appendix FM are as follows:

         "Section R-LTRP: Requirements for limited  leave  to  remain  as  a
         partner-

         R-LTRP.1.1.  The requirements to be met for limited leave to remain
         as a partner are-


         (a)  the applicant and their partner must be in the UK;
         (b)  the applicant must have made a valid application  for  limited
             or indefinite leave to remain as a partner; and either


         (c)  (i)      the applicant must not fall for refusal under Section
                  S-LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and


             (ii) the applicant meets all of the requirements of Section E-
                  LTRP:
                  Eligibility for leave to remain as a partner; or


         (d)  (i) the applicant must not fall for refusal under  Section  S-
                  LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and


             (ii) the applicant meets the  requirements  of  paragraphs  E-
                  LTRP.1.2 to 1.12 and E-LTRP.2.1.; and


             (iii)    paragraph EX.1 applies."


23. Section E-LTRP.1.2 sets out  the  relationship  requirements,  none  of
    which are in issue in this appeal.

24. Section E-LTRP.2.1 sets out  the  immigration  status  requirements  as
    follows:

         "E-LTRP.2.1. The applicant must not be in the UK-


         (a)  as a visitor;


         (b)  with valid leave granted for a period of  6  months  or  less,
             unless that leave  is  as  the  fianc�(e)  or  proposed  civil
             partner, or was granted pending the outcome of family court or
             divorce proceedings; or


         (c)  on temporary admission or temporary release (unless  paragraph
             EX.1. applies).

         E-LTRP.2.2 The applicant must  not  be  in  the  UK  in  breach  of
         immigration laws (disregarding any  period  of  overstaying  for  a
         period of 28 days or less), unless paragraph EX1 applies."


         "Section EX.1 this paragraph applies if:

         (a)  (i) the  applicant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                  relationship with a child who-

         (aa) is under the age of 18 years;


         (bb) is in the UK;


         (cc) is a British Citizen or has lived in the UK  continuously  for
             at least  the  7  years  immediately  preceding  the  date  of
             application; and

             (ii) it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
                  the UK; or


         (b)  the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a
             partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled  in
             the UK or  in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or  humanitarian
             protection, and there are insurmountable obstacles  to  family
             life with that partner continuing outside the UK."

25. In Sabir the Tribunal held that the First-tier judge erred  in  finding
    that EX1 was a freestanding paragraph to be considered irrespective  of
    the other requirements of Appendix FM.

26. They wrote as follows:

         "The question of whether paragraph EX.1 applies does not arise; the
         conjunctive  link,  'and',  requires  her  to  meet  paragraph   R-
         LTRP.1.1.d(i) and (ii) before requiring her to meet (iii).  EX.1 is
         not  free-standing  but  is  accessible  only  to  those  who  have
         successfully navigated their way through the 2nd of the alternative
         routes through R-LTRP.  Put another  way,  whereas  there  are  two
         parts of the requirements to be met under R-LTRP.1.1.(c), under  R-
         LTRP.1.1.(d) there are three.


          It is plain from the  architecture  of  the  Rules  that  EX.1  is
         'parasitic' on a Rule within  Appendix  FM  that  otherwise  grants
         leave to remain. If EX.1 was intended to be a free-standing element
         irrespective  of  R-LTRP  it  would  have  been  identified  as  R-
         LTRP.1.1.(e) or some other mechanism of identification  would  have
         been used.   The  structure  of  the  Rules  as  presently  drafted
         requires it to be a component part of R-LTRP.1.1.(d)."

27. The relevant requirement in Sabir was E-LTRP2.1, and the  Appellant  in
    that case, who had been granted leave to remain as  a  visitor,   could
    not meet it.


28. Ms Hasmi established that the Appellant in this case has been  able  to
    navigate his way through Section R-LTRP(d)(i)-(iii)  in  the  following
    way.

29. No issue has been raised with respect to R-LTRP.1.1(a), (b) and (c)(i).
     The appellant and his partner are in the UK  and  have  made  a  valid
    application for limited leave. Perhaps surprisingly, Section S-LTR, the
    suitability requirement, was not raised either.  There  is  a  puzzling
    reference in the refusal letter to paragraph 353B, which on the face of
    it has no application, and Mr Diwncyz, when asked, stated that  he  was
    not raising suitability now.



30. So far as Section E-LTRP, eligibility for leave to remain as a  partner
    is concerned, no issue was raised with respect to E-LTRP.1.2 - 12.  The
    relationship between the Appellant  and  Sponsor  is  unchallenged.  E-
    LTRP.2.1 does not apply.

31. E-LTRP2.2 states in terms that the applicant must not be in the  UK  in
    breach   of   Immigration   laws,   unless   paragraph   EX1   applies.
    Accordingly the Appellant is entitled to rely upon paragraph EX1.

32. The judge found that it would not be reasonable  to  expect  the  three
    British children who are established  in  nursery  and  primary  school
    education to leave the UK and live in an unfamiliar country  where  the
    standard of living would be  poorer.   No  challenge  was  made  by  Mr
    Diwncyz to her conclusions. Although she later said in connection  with
    her  consideration  of  Article  8  generally  that  it  would  not  be
    unjustifiably harsh to expect the whole family  to  relocate  to  India
    that is not the test imposed by Section EX1(a)(ii).

33. The judge erred in law in  failing  to  consider  whether  Section  EX1
    applied. It does, and on her findings, the Appellant succeeds under the
    Rules.

Decision

34. The original judge erred in law and the decision  is  set  aside.   The
    following decision is substituted.  The appeal is allowed.
