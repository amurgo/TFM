Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Wells, Fast Track Immigration Services
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  said  aside,  with  no
    findings preserved, at a hearing which took place at the Upper Tribunal
    on 17 May 2016. Those decision and reasons are set out in the  decision
    of the President, Mr Justice McCloskey.

 2. This is a de novo hearing of the appeals, which concern the Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006, specifically Regulation 6.

 3. In advance of the hearing, those representing the appellants  served  a
    213-page bundle on the Upper Tribunal and the respondent.  Included  in
    the said bundle, were detailed witness statements from  the  appellants
    which addressed their relationship as well as  the  second  appellant's
    occupation; evidence of their continued cohabitation; evidence  of  the
    second appellant's employment and self-employment as well  as  evidence
    of the  professional  qualifications  of  Mr  Rashid  Ali,  the  second
    appellant's  accountant,  in  respect  of  whom  an  unsigned   witness
    statement was also provided.

 4. When this matter came before me, there was no need  to  hear  from  the
    appellants as the  matter  proceeded  by  way  of  exceptionally  brief
    submissions from the  representatives,  who  were  in  full  agreement.
    Essentially, Mr Walker informed me that the  respondent  accepted  that
    the second appellant is and was both  employed  and  self-employed  and
    that she was, therefore, a worker.

 5. Mr Wells indicated that he wished to argue that  the  second  appellant
    had been discriminated against as  a  European  national,  in  that  he
    argued that the Secretary of State had imposed a requirement upon  her,
    which would not be imposed on a British citizen.  The  requirement  was
    said to be one to provide accounts from  an  accountant  regulated  and
    authorised to produce audited accounts. Ultimately, Mr  Wells  accepted
    that there was no such requirement in  the  Regulations  and  that  the
    suggestion of such a requirement in the reasons for refusal letters was
    more likely to be down to an "over- zealous" decision maker.

 6. Lastly, Mr Wells sought  confirmation  from  the  respondent  that  the
    relationship between the appellants was not in issue. Mr Walker advised
    me that the said relationship was not and has never been  a  matter  of
    concern to the Secretary of State.

 7. At the end of the hearing, I reserved  my  decision,  while  giving  an
    indication that the appeal would be allowed.

 8. According to the reasons for refusal letters dated 10 January 2014, the
    appellants'  applications  for,  variously,  a   residence   card   and
    registration certificate, were refused solely as it  was  not  accepted
    that the second appellant was exercising Treaty rights  as  defined  in
    Regulation 6. At the time of  the  application,  the  second  appellant
    stated that she was working as a self-employed cleaner.  The  Secretary
    of State made several criticisms of the evidence provided in support of
    the applications, however there was no allegation  of  false  documents
    having been provided. The said evidence dated from early to mid-2013.

 9. By the time of the hearing before me, the second appellant's employment
    had altered, on more than one occasion,  since  the  applications  were
    made. While  the  respondent's  concerns  as  to  the  documents  which
    accompanied the applications have been addressed, given the passage  of
    time since the applications were made, I have focused my  attention  on
    the evidence of the second appellant's present economic activity.

10. The unchallenged evidence before me is that  the  second  appellant  is
    currently employed as a cleaner by Essex Security Solutions. Supporting
    evidence, in the form of pay-slips,  shows  that  she  generally  earns
    between �800 and �900 per month. The said pay-slips date from  February
    2015 until May 2016. Prior to that she was working for ISS UK Ltd.  The
    second appellant also continues her self-employed cleaning  work  which
    she began in 2013; this consists of domestic  cleaning  on  an  ad  hoc
    basis. There was a substantial quantity of documentary evidence  before
    me which supports her claim that she has invoiced clients for  cleaning
    work, has employed an accountant and  that  she  has  been  filing  tax
    returns regularly since 2013. In view of the absence of  any  challenge
    to the documentary evidence before me, it follows that  I  accept  that
    the second appellant is a qualified person.

11. The appeals are allowed under the 2006 Regulations.
