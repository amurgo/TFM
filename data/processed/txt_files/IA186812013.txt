                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on  4th  August  1962.   She
    appealed against a decision of the Respondent dated  7th  May  2013  to
    refuse to issue her with a residence card as confirmation of the  right
    to reside as the family member of an EEA national alternatively as  the
    extended family member of the EEA national pursuant  to  Regulations  7
    and 8 of the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006
    ("the 2006 Regulations").  The Appellant states that she is the  family
    member,  alternatively the extended family member, of  Mr  Jose  Manuel
    Lopes da Silva, a citizen of  Portugal.   The  Appellant's  appeal  was
    dismissed by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Wright sitting at  Hatton
    Cross on 17th  January  2014.   The  Appellant  appealed  against  that
    decision and an error of law was found by Deputy Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    McCarthy sitting at Field House on 18th March 2014.  Attached  to  this
    determination is a copy of Judge McCarthy's determination.

2.   To summarise the error was that Judge Wright had  not  dealt  with  the
    Appellant's claim under Article 8 (right to  respect  for  private  and
    family life) of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Whilst  Judge
    Wright's finding that the Appellant could not bring herself within  the
    2006 Regulations was preserved, Judge McCarthy adjourned the hearing of
    the appeal on Article 8 grounds.  The matter was  listed  before  Judge
    McCarthy but as he was unable to sit on the day in question a  transfer
    order was made by Principal Resident Judge Southern on 29th April  2014
    as a result of which the hearing of the Appellant's appeal on Article 8
    grounds against the Respondent's decision came before me.

3.   The Appellant entered the United  Kingdom  in  2004,  or  alternatively
    2006, as a visitor and overstayed.  On 18th December 2008 she sought to
    be issued with a residence card.  This application was refused  by  the
    Respondent, as was a second application made on 11th February 2012.   A
    third application made  on  24th  December  2012  was  refused  by  the
    Respondent and has given rise to the present proceedings.

4.   The Appellant's evidence was that she met the Sponsor in  2007  through
    a relative.  The Sponsor suffered from a number of health issues,  when
    he was really ill she used to help him and  call  an  ambulance.   They
    moved in together in 2008 at an address  in  Edgware,  Middlesex.   The
    Sponsor's health began to improve during the course  of  2012.   Before
    that he could not go out as he was always  going  to  and  from  or  in
    hospital.  The Sponsor was visited occasionally by friends and  members
    of his own family, a brother, a sister and his mother.  The Sponsor had
    not worked since 2007.  He had begun studying at Barnet College in 2009
    but had not finished his studies.  He came to  the  United  Kingdom  in
    2004  to  find  work  in  the  building  construction  industry  having
    previously served in the Portuguese Army.  He injured his spine at work
    affecting his right side.  He told his GP, who wrote a letter  for  him
    for the hearing at first instance that he had not worked for  the  last
    ten years.

The Proceedings at First Instance

5.   The Judge found that the Sponsor  was  not  a  qualified  person.   The
    Sponsor was neither a worker,  a  job  seeker,  self-sufficient  nor  a
    student.  Although at paragraph  29  of  the  determination  the  Judge
    accepted that the Appellant and Sponsor were in a durable relationship,
    they could not come within Regulation 8(5) of the 2006  Regulations  as
    the Appellant could not be an extended family member of someone who was
    not a qualified person.  Regulation 7 (family members)  did  not  apply
    because they were  unmarried  and  unrelated.  The  Appellant  was  not
    entitled to the issue of a residence card under the 2006 Regulations.

6.   In refusing the  Appellant's  application  for  a  residence  card  the
    Respondent stated that consideration had not been given to whether  the
    Appellant's removal would breach Article 8.  No notice of  decision  to
    remove was made by the Respondent when refusing the EEA application  in
    accordance with the Respondent's normal practice.  In  the  event  that
    departure might be enforced the  Respondent  would  first  contact  the
    Appellant  and  she  would  have  a  separate   opportunity   to   make
    representations against the proposed removal.   In  the  event  that  a
    decision to remove was made  it  would  attract  a  separate  right  of
    appeal. With this in mind the Judge held he did  not  have  to  address
    Article 8 and he dismissed the appeal.

7.   The Appellant appealed against that decision, arguing  that  the  Judge
    should have dealt with Article 8. Permission to appeal was  granted  on
    the papers by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Nicholson  on  18th  February
    2014.  He noted that the Appellant's grounds of appeal  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal against the Respondent's decision did include  an  appeal
    on Article 8 grounds and therefore it was arguable that  the  Appellant
    had a right of appeal by virtue of Schedule 1, paragraph 1 of the  2006
    Regulations.  Under these Regulations  an  Appellant  has  a  right  of
    appeal against an EEA decision on  the  grounds  that  removal  of  the
    Appellant in consequence of a decision breaches his or her rights under
    the ECHR.   Judge  Nicholson  referred  to  a  decision  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Ahmed [2013] UKUT 00089. They  were  entitled  to  deal  with
    Article 8 following the Court of Appeal decision in JM  Liberia  [2006]
    EWCA Civ 1402.  It was arguable that the  Judge  erred  in  failing  to
    consider the Appellant's appeal on human rights grounds  under  Article
    8.  As the parties had been found to be in a durable  relationship  the
    appeal under Article 8 was not wholly without merit.

The Error of Law Stage

8.   Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge McCarthy held that under Section  86(1)  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  the  Tribunal  was
    required to determine any matter raised as a ground of appeal.  As  the
    Appellant had raised Article 8 in appealing  against  the  Respondent's
    decision, Judge Wright had to determine it.   The  Respondent  had  not
    opposed the Appellant's appeal when submitting her own Rule  24  notice
    and the Presenting Officer at  the  hearing  before  the  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge had conceded that the determination was  legally  flawed
    because the Judge had not dealt with Article 8.

9.   The Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge was not able to  complete  the  hearing
    as one piece of documentary evidence was missing.  He  gave  directions
    that the Appellant was required  to  provide  details  of  the  current
    weekly amounts paid to the Sponsor in  income  support  and  disability
    living allowance and the current weekly council tax  payments  made  by
    the Sponsor.  Finally he noted:

         "In addition to the above directions the  parties  should  bear  in
         mind the following: Judge Wright's finding in paragraph 29  of  his
         determination stands [the durability of the relationship] and it is
         accepted that the Appellant and her partner have been in a  durable
         relationship for seven or eight years.  In determining  the  appeal
         amongst other issues I will have regard to  the  Immigration  Rules
         insofar as they set out the public interest  and  I  will  consider
         whether the Appellant's circumstances are such that  they  outweigh
         the public interest  in  controlling  immigration  because  of  her
         partner's health condition."

The Hearing Before Me

10.  In consequence, when the matter came before it  was  to  determine  the
    Article 8 aspect of the appeal. The Appellant  appeared  unrepresented,
    as she had before both the Judge at first  instance  and  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge McCarthy.  As there was no request to adjourn to  enable
    her to seek further representation, I considered that it was reasonable
    in all the circumstances to proceed. The Appellant indicated  that  she
    had sought advice in the past from two different representatives  about
    this matter.  The first was a solicitor whose office was  closed  down.
    The second was the firm of solicitors, IEI Solicitors, who  had  lodged
    the notice of appeal against the Respondent's original  decision.   She
    had spent a lot of money on representatives.

11.  In response to the directions  made  by  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    McCarthy (see paragraph 9 above) the Appellant  filed  a  letter  dated
    17th March 2014 from the London Borough  of  Barnet  addressed  to  the
    Sponsor notifying him of his housing benefit in the sum of �183.25  per
    week from 7th April 2014 and that he would receive council tax  support
    of �16.39 per week.  The  total  amount  of  council  tax  support  for
    2014/15 would amount to �854.66.   The  Sponsor  was  receiving  income
    related employment and support  allowance  and  thus  entitled  to  the
    maximum housing benefit which was equal to the full amount of his rent.
     The maximum council tax support the Sponsor could have received  would
    have been �934.05 for the year.  In fact what he was going  to  receive
    was the slightly reduced  sum  of  �854.66.   That  was  91.5%  of  his
    entitlement, paid to  him  because  he  was  receiving  income  related
    employment and support allowance.

12.  The Appellant also filed a document setting out her case under  Article
    8 in which she said that she and the Sponsor had been  living  together
    for over seven years and could be regarded as a common law couple.  The
    Sponsor was heavily  dependent  on  her,  having  been  diagnosed  with
    paranoid schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder  and  HIV.   The
    Appellant and the Sponsor met at a soup  kitchen  where  the  Appellant
    showed generosity and compassion towards the Sponsor, inviting  him  to
    attend her local church  and  accompanying  him  to  a  drug  treatment
    project.  The Sponsor had now been free from class A drugs for over two
    years and had successfully completed various training  and  educational
    programmes which would not have been possible without the assistance of
    the Appellant.  The Appellant had become the Sponsor's  official  carer
    in 2011, receiving a carer's allowance accordingly.

13.  In oral testimony she  said  that  when  the  Sponsor's  condition  was
    serious she had to be there for him 24 hours a day.  Now he was getting
    better.  She could not go back to Nigeria to apply for entry  clearance
    to join the Sponsor because she needed to be with him.  She had  looked
    for her passport but could not find it.  She had received a letter from
    the Respondent dated 26th February 2010 stating that she  was  free  to
    stay in the United Kingdom and free to work.   None  of  the  Sponsor's
    family members were looking after the Sponsor that was  why  he  wanted
    the Appellant to be there because of his sickness.  She had  been  told
    by Social Services not to leave the Appellant on his own.  She had told
    the Judge at first instance that the weekend  before  the  hearing  the
    Sponsor had had a bad dream resulting in him being  admitted  to  Chase
    Farm then Edgware Mental Health Hospital.   There  would  be  no  other
    support available for the Sponsor other than what  she  gave.  She  was
    presently working in a care home, variable hours, sometimes  as  little
    as three hours a day sometimes as much as ten.

14.  I next heard evidence from the Sponsor who adopted a statement  he  had
    made for these proceedings in which he said he had been diagnosed  with
    paranoid  schizophrenia,  PTSD  and  HIV  shortly  after  leaving   the
    Portuguese Special Forces  in  1990.   After  arriving  in  the  United
    Kingdom in 2004 he developed a drug addiction which made  him  homeless
    for a few years.  He used to visit soup kitchens and that was where  he
    met the Appellant.  She invited him to her local  church  and  referred
    him to a drug/alcohol treatment project to  address  his  chaotic  drug
    problem.  The Appellant had helped him enormously, paying the rent  and
    utility bills at their address in Edgware.  He was later referred to  a
    mental health charity in Barnet and given  a  one  bedroomed  flat  and
    commenced treatment for his HIV at the Royal Free Hospital.   He  would
    be devastated if her application was unsuccessful.

15.  In oral testimony he said since he had met the Appellant his  life  had
    changed, he had improved.  She had pushed him to go to  school  and  to
    the church.  He had been aware for a long time that the  Appellant  had
    no status to remain in the United Kingdom.  It was quite  a  few  years
    ago.   He  had  tried  contacting  solicitors  without  success.    The
    Appellant used to work as his carer receiving the carers allowance  but
    then she found a part-time job about a year or two ago since  when  she
    had been supporting the Sponsor from what she earned. The  Sponsor  did
    not feel that his family, brother, sister and mother,  helped  him,  in
    fact they gave him more stress as they accused  him  and  discriminated
    against him because of his HIV  status.   He  had  discussed  with  the
    Appellant her returning to Nigeria but if she stayed  as  much  as  two
    days away from him bad things happened.  He had tried to  kill  himself
    by taking an overdose of tablets.  Last time she had found him  in  the
    road walking in his pyjamas.  When the Appellant went to work there was
    a neighbour who could help.  He also had the telephone number  for  the
    Crisis mental health team as he had started treatment with them again.

Closing Submissions

16.  In closing for the Respondent it was argued that there was no  evidence
    that the Appellant had ever been issued with a two year visit visa, the
    maximum she would have been issued with was six months and anyway  that
    was the maximum she could stay at any one time even if the visa was for
    two years.  The  Appellant  had  thus  overstayed.   The  last  medical
    evidence on the Sponsor was dated 2012, there was  nothing  from  2014.
    It was not the case that the Sponsor  needed  24  hour  care  from  the
    Appellant as she was able to hold down an outside job.  The evidence at
    first instance was that the Sponsor saw members of his family.  If they
    were discriminating against him in the way he complained it begged  the
    question why they would want to have contact  with  him  in  the  first
    place.  The relationship had started  in  2008  and  yet  in  2010  the
    Sponsor had tried to commit suicide.  It could not  therefore  be  said
    that it was the relationship that was saving the  Sponsor's  life.   In
    any event there was no clear medical evidence as to  what  the  current
    situation was.  There were some health issues for the  Sponsor  and  he
    received some support from other  people.   He  had  a  neighbour,  his
    family and church members.  There was nothing in this case  that  would
    mean that it should be allowed outside the Immigration Rules.

17.  In closing the Appellant stated that she had  received  a  letter  from
    the Respondent and thought she had sent it to the  Tribunal.   She  had
    filled out a form to obtain a national  insurance  number  and  started
    college in 2009.  She had advised the Sponsor to improve  his  English.
    The letter from the Respondent she had submitted to the  college.   She
    appeared then to retract her claim that she had sent the letter to  the
    Tribunal, saying that if the college was contacted a copy of the letter
    could be found.

18.  On 21st May eight days after the hearing (and  without  permission)  Mr
    Jonathan Ashby describing himself as the Appellant's appointed advocate
    submitted three further documents to the Tribunal. The first was a copy
    of the first page of a letter written on 11th October 2008 by a firm of
    solicitors Nasra Imran of London SE15  to  the  Respondent  making  the
    Appellant's application for a residence card  as  the  partner  of  the
    Sponsor. The second was a letter from the Respondent to the  solicitors
    dated 26th January 2009  confirming  that  the  application  was  being
    considered and while it was the Appellant was  entitled  to  work.  The
    third document was a letter from the  Solicitors  Regulation  Authority
    dated 4th January 2010 noting the Appellant's claim that she  had  paid
    Messrs Nasra Imran �1,860 in fees but they  could  not  reimburse  this
    amount from the compensation fund as she had  provided  no  documentary
    evidence of payment.

Findings

19.  The only issue I have  to  deal  with  in  this  case  is  whether  the
    Appellant can succeed  outside  the  Immigration  Rules  and  the  2006
    Regulations under the provisions of Article 8.  It  has  been  decided
    that  the  Appellant  should  have  a  right  of  appeal  against   the
    Respondent's decision under Article 8.  In coming to that view  neither
    Judge Nicholson who granted  permission  to  appeal  nor  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge McCarthy referred to the Court of Appeal decision in the
    case of Nirula [2012] EWCA Civ 1436.  That decision upheld  an  earlier
    decision of the Deputy High Court Judge Mr C M G Ockelton  (the  Deputy
    President of the Upper Tribunal) who had held that it was too  late  to
    raise a human rights claim for the first time in  a  notice  of  appeal
    since in a case which would otherwise require an out of country  appeal
    any asylum claim or human rights claim has to be made before  a  notice
    of appeal is served.  The Appellant  must,  adopting  the  language  of
    Section 92(1) of the 2002 Act, have made his claim at an earlier stage.



20.  It does not appear that the Appellant  in  this  case  made  her  human
    rights claim  any  earlier  than  her  notice  of  appeal  against  the
    Respondent's  decision.   It  is  open  to  the  Respondent  in   those
    circumstances to take the  jurisdictional  point  that  the  notice  of
    appeal is invalid insofar as it relates to Article 8.  It is clear from
    the notice of decision in this case that the Respondent did  take  that
    jurisdictional point at that stage by indicating to the Appellant  that
    if the Appellant failed to voluntarily depart a separate decision would
    be made at a later date, the implication being that Article 8 could  be
    raised at that time.

21.  What appears to have then happened,  after  permission  to  appeal  was
    granted,  was  that  the  Respondent  withdrew  her  objection  to  the
    jurisdictional point in her Rule 24 notice dated 3rd March  2014.  This
    stated that the Respondent did not oppose the  Appellant's  application
    for permission to appeal and invited  the  Tribunal  to  determine  the
    appeal with a fresh oral hearing to consider Article 8 only.  That  was
    confirmed by the Senior Home Office  Presenting  Officer  who  appeared
    before Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge McCarthy.  Whilst therefore I  would
    respectfully disagree with the Learned Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge that
    the position at the time the Judge at first instance heard  the  matter
    was that the Appellant  had  a  right  to  have  her  Article  8  claim
    considered, there is no  doubt  that  the  position  now  is  that  the
    Respondent is not taking the jurisdictional point and  the  matter  can
    therefore proceed by way of an Article 8 hearing.

22.  It is not argued in this case that  the  Appellant  can  bring  herself
    within the Immigration Rules, paragraph 276ADE and/or Appendix FM.  She
    has only been in the United Kingdom a relatively short time, she has  a
    poor immigration history, having overstayed her visitor's visa, and her
    two previous applications under the 2006 Regulations were both  refused
    by the Respondent and not it appears appealed.  I am conscious that the
    Respondent has not seen the  post  hearing  evidence  and  thus  cannot
    comment on its genuineness. However even if I accept it at  face  value
    it only confirms that an application for a residence card was  made  in
    2008, which is not in dispute and that the Appellant  was  entitled  to
    work whilst the application was being considered. What it does not deal
    with is the fact that that application was ultimately unsuccessful thus
    putting the Appellant back into the  same  position  that  she  had  no
    leave.

23.   Again  accepting  the  documentation  she  can  show  that  her  first
    solicitors were closed down by the SRA after she had paid  the  firm  a
    considerable  amount  of   money   for   an   ultimately   unsuccessful
    application. That does not take matters significantly further since  it
    does not deal with the fact that she made a second application in  2012
    (which was also  unsuccessful).  If  her  first  application  had  been
    successful and (as she claims) she had been granted the right  to  live
    and work permanently she would not  have  needed  to  make  the  second
    application. In short the documentation while confirming  some  of  her
    evidence does not confirm the crucial issue of whether she was  granted
    some form of leave to remain and permanent right to work.

24.  The Appellant cannot bring herself within the  2006  Regulations  since
    the Sponsor is not a qualified person.  She therefore  seeks  leave  to
    remain outside the Immigration Rules under Article 8.There has  been  a
    considerable amount of case law on Article 8 centring on the weight  to
    be given to the legitimate aim being pursued by the Respondent  against
    the impact on the Appellant's private and family life and that of close
    members of her family.

25.  Applying the step by step approach  required  by  the  case  of  Razgar
    [2004] UKHL 27, the Appellant and Sponsor have a family  life  together
    since they are in  a  durable  relationship.   Although  there  are  no
    removal directions, the decision to refuse the Appellant's  request  to
    remain in this country outside the Immigration Rules would impact  upon
    their relationship since it will make it difficult for the Appellant to
    obtain work and potentially could leave her in a state of limbo.

26.  The Respondent's decision is  in  accordance  with  a  legitimate  aim,
    namely immigration control, because she cannot meet the requirements of
    the Rules and she has overstayed her visitor's visa.  The  issue  comes
    down to the proportionality of the interference  with  the  established
    family life.  Where an Appellant has no leave to remain but seeks to do
    so outside the Rules, the Upper Tribunal in the case of Gulshan  [2013]
    UKUT 640 said it is only if there may  be  arguably  good  grounds  for
    granting leave to remain outside the Rules is it necessary for  Article
    8  purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are   compelling
    circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the Rules (citing Nagre
    [2013] EWHC 720).

27.  The decision of Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge  McCarthy  indicated  that
    there were arguably good grounds for granting leave to  remain  outside
    the Rules, given the durability of the relationship and  the  Sponsor's
    medical condition. This meant that  it  was  necessary  for  Article  8
    purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether   there   were   compelling
    circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the Rules.   One  would
    also have to consider the practical possibilities of relocation by  the
    Sponsor to Nigeria or by the Appellant to Portugal.  In the absence  of
    such obstacles (to relocation) it would be necessary to show other non-
    standard and particular features demonstrating that the removal of  the
    Appellant would be unjustifiably harsh (assuming that removal  was  the
    issue).  The Respondent's guidance states that unique  factors  do  not
    generally render cases exceptional.

28.  Inevitably in a case of this kind the decision is  likely  to  be  fact
    sensitive.  If the Appellant returned to Nigeria that would disrupt the
    relationship.  In the light of the Sponsor's ill health it is difficult
    to see how he could reasonably be expected to travel  to  Nigeria  with
    her.  Similarly it is difficult to see how the Appellant  could  travel
    to Portugal given that she would have no status to enter that  country.
    The issue therefore is whether the  separation  of  the  parties  is  a
    disproportionate interference with their family life given the  durable
    relationship and the Sponsor's  health  condition.   The  Appellant  is
    providing some care for the Sponsor.  He is not entirely lacking in any
    other form of care, notwithstanding his claims  to  the  contrary.   He
    receives visits from his family and I agree with the point that  it  is
    difficult to see why they would continue to visit him if they  had  the
    bad  feelings  towards  him  he  claims.   He  is  also   assisted   by
    professionals, particularly medical professionals.

29.  Life would potentially be unpleasant  for  him  if  the  Appellant  was
    unable to care for him but would the outcome  be  unjustifiably  harsh?
    The Appellant has overstayed and entered into a  relationship  with  an
    EEA national at a time when both knew in effect  that  her  status  was
    precarious (the Sponsor admitting that he had known for a  considerable
    number of years that the Appellant had no right to be here).  It is not
    open to the parties to choose  where  to  conduct  their  family  life.
    There seems to be no good reason why the Appellant could not return  to
    Nigeria to apply from there for entry clearance.  Her reason for not so
    doing was that she could not be away from the Appellant for any  length
    of time but for the reasons I give above I reject that  claim.   Whilst
    she would be away from the Sponsor for a  period  of  time  whilst  the
    application was being considered, there is no evidence to suggest  that
    the Entry Clearance Officer in Abuja would take an undue length of time
    to consider the application.  During that time care arrangements  could
    be made for the  Sponsor  who  has  access  to  help  from  the  health
    authorities and others.  I do not accept that I have been given a  true
    picture of the help that the Sponsor currently receives from his family
    or that he would receive if the Appellant was not there.

30.  It is far more likely that the reason why the Appellant did not  return
    to Nigeria to apply from there was because of concerns  as  to  whether
    the criteria such as the financial criteria could be met in this  case.
    The effect of the Appellant's application, by being made in country, is
    to jump the queue and not subject herself to detailed requirements such
    as financial  ones.  By  contrast  she  would  have  to  satisfy  those
    requirements if she  made  an  application  for  entry  clearance  from
    outside the United Kingdom.

31.  Whilst therefore there would be an interference in the relationship  by
    not granting the Appellant leave  to  remain  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules, I do not consider that  it  would  be  disproportionate  to  the
    legitimate aim being pursued.  Both parties knew that the Appellant had
    no right to be here, I do not accept that the Sponsor is so  bereft  of
    assistance besides that of the Appellant that the consequences  of  the
    Appellant leaving the United Kingdom would be unjustifiably harsh.   As
    the Upper Tribunal pointed out at paragraph 27 of Gulshan,  it  is  not
    the correct approach in this case to embark on a freewheeling Article 8
    analysis unencumbered by the Rules.  Applying that guidance  there  are
    no compelling circumstances insufficiently recognised under  the  Rules
    such that the Appellant should be granted leave to remain  outside  the
    Rules.

32.  There is evidence of the Sponsor's benefits (see paragraph  11  above),
    but little evidence of any  earnings  the  Appellant  has  now.  It  is
    difficult  to  see  how  the  Appellant  is  supporting   the   Sponsor
    financially and I do not find there is any form of financial dependence
    by the Sponsor on the Appellant in this case.  Although  the  Appellant
    might have succeeded under the 2006 Regulations if the Sponsor had been
    a qualified person, the fact that he is not is  of  some  significance.
    This is not a case of a near miss but even if it  was  that  of  itself
    would not assist  the  Appellant.   As  I  do  not  consider  that  any
    interference  by  a  refusal  to  grant  leave  outside  the  Rules  is
    disproportionate, I dismiss the Appellant's appeal under Article 8.  As
    I have dismissed the appeal I make no fee award in this case.   I  make
    no anonymity order as there is no public policy interest for so doing.



Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and has been set aside in relation to Article 8.  I remake the  decision
in relation to Article 8 by dismissing the Appellant's  appeal  against  the
Respondent's decision.

Appellant's appeal dismissed.




Signed this 30th day of  May  2014
