Officers)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Galina  [H],  a  citizen  of  Ukraine  born  12
       October 1980, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge
       Watson) of 19 December 2018 dismissing her  appeal  on  human  rights
       grounds, itself brought against the refusal of her human rights claim
       of 6 February 2018.

    2. This appeal was listed for a case management hearing on 12 April 2019
       but in order to ensure effective use of the Tribunal's  resources  it
       was expedient, with the agreement of the parties, to treat the listed
       hearing as the occasion to determine the question of error of law.

    3. The Appellant and Sponsor, [WH], married in Ukraine in June 2016  and
       the former applied for entry clearance as  a  spouse  on  7  November
       2017. The relationship is plainly a genuine one, as accepted  by  the
       Secretary of State  and  First-tier  Tribunal.  The  application  was
       refused only because of a failure to meet the financial requirements.
       In  particular,  there  were  missing  bank  statements  within   the
       necessary 12 month period, and the  evidence  required  to  show  the
       business's viability were not available,  there  being  no  unaudited
       accounts or an accountant's certificate

    4. The First-tier Tribunal assessed the evidence for itself,  and  found
       that  the  specified  evidence  required  to   meet   the   financial
       requirements were not all provided. The First-tier  Tribunal  decided
       that there was no  requirement  to  apply  principles  of  evidential
       flexibility in this situation to request missing documents.

    5. As the Rules were not met, the First-tier Tribunal went on to  assess
       the case outside the Rules. It concluded that whilst the  Appellant's
       inability to meet the Rules was  minor,  the  policy  objective  they
       enshrined was not in  fact  met,  as  the  quantum  of  earnings  was
       insufficient: it was thought necessary to evince the  required  level
       of support for a spouse and her son, being �22,400. However  the  net
       profit established by the HMRC documents was �21,517. Accordingly the
       refusal of entry clearance was proportionate.

    6. Granting permission to appeal, the First-tier Tribunal on 25  January
       2019 noted that the Appellant's son from a previous relationship  had
       not applied for entry clearance and so was not  part  of  the  family
       unit  for  whom  financial  support  was  required.  Accordingly  the
       benchmark figure for maintenance used to assess the claim's viability
       outside the Rules was wrong. This was a material error of law.  Judge
       Blundell in this permission grant noted that the Secretary  of  State
       might wish to consider whether the matter warranted a hearing in  the
       First-tier Tribunal.

    7. On 14 February 2019 Judge Rintoul for the Upper Tribunal wrote to the
       parties stating that his  provisional  view  was  that  there  was  a
       material error of law and that the appeal might fall  to  be  allowed
       without a further hearing subject to  the  parties  submissions;  the
       Secretary of State might find himself vulnerable to an adverse  costs
       order if the appeal was unjustifiably opposed.

    8. On 20 February 2019 the Secretary of State  wrote  stating  that  the
       contention that an error of law  was  established  was  not  opposed;
       however the appropriate disposal of the appeal was for a  continuance
       hearing.

  Findings and reasons

    9. The Immigration Rules state:

           "Financial requirements

           E-ECP.3.1. The applicant must provide specified  evidence,  from
           the sources listed in paragraph E-ECP.3.2., of-

           (a)   a specified gross annual income of at least-

                (i)    �18,600;

                (ii)   an additional �3,800 for the first child; and

                (iii)  an additional �2,400 for each additional child; alone
                or in combination with

           (b)   specified savings of-

                (i)    �16,000; and

                (ii)   additional savings of an  amount  equivalent  to  2.5
                times the amount which is the difference between  the  gross
                annual income  from  the  sources  listed  in  paragraph  E-
                ECP.3.2.(a)-(d)  and  the  total   amount   required   under
                paragraph E-ECP.3.1.(a); or

           (c)   the requirements in paragraph E-ECP.3.3. being met.

           In this  paragraph  "child"  means  a  dependent  child  of  the
           applicant or the applicant's partner who is-

           (a)   under the age of 18 years, or who was under the age of  18
           years when they were first granted entry under this route;

           (b)   applying  for  entry  clearance  as  a  dependant  of  the
           applicant or the applicant's partner, or is in the UK with leave
           as their dependant;

           (c)   not a British Citizen or settled in the UK

           ...

           Family Members - Specified Evidence

           D.    (a)   In deciding an application in relation to which this
           Appendix states that specified documents must be  provided,  the
           Entry Clearance Officer or Secretary of  State  ("the  decision-
           maker") will consider documents that have  been  submitted  with
           the application, and  will  only  consider  documents  submitted
           after the  application  where  sub-paragraph  (b),  (e)  or  (f)
           applies.

                (b)    If the applicant:

                    (i)      Has submitted:

                        (aa)      A sequence of documents and some  of  the
                        documents in the sequence have been  omitted  (e.g.
                        if one bank statement from a series is missing);

                        (bb)      A  document  in  the  wrong  format  (for
                        example, if a letter is not on letterhead paper  as
                        specified); or

                        (cc)      DELETED

                        (dd)      A document which does not contain all  of
                        the specified information; or

                    (ii)     Has not submitted  a  specified  document,  the
                    decision-maker  may  contact  the   applicant   or   his
                    representative in writing or otherwise, and request  the
                    document(s) or  the  correct  version(s).  The  material
                    requested must be received at the address  specified  in
                    the request within a reasonable timescale  specified  in
                    the request.

           ...

           7.    In respect of self-employment in the UK as a partner, as a
           sole trader or in a franchise  all  of  the  following  must  be
           provided:

                ...

                (h)     One  of  the  following  documents  must   also   be
                submitted:

                    (i)      (aa) If the business  is  required  to  produce
                    annual audited accounts, such accounts for the last full
                    financial year; or

                    (bb)     If the business  is  not  required  to  produce
                    annual audited accounts, unaudited accounts for the last
                    full financial year and an accountant's  certificate  of
                    confirmation, from an accountant who is a member of a UK
                    Recognised Supervisory Body (as defined in the Companies
                    Act 2006) or  who  is  a  member  of  the  Institute  of
                    Financial Accountants;"

   10. It is accordingly clear that, as already noted by Judge Blundell, the
       relevant financial benchmark was �18,600. The failure of  the  First-
       tier Tribunal to appreciate this undermined its decision, given  that
       it accordingly misappraised the extent to  which  the  public  policy
       position comprised in the financial requirements was met. This was  a
       serious and material error of law.

   11. It was also an error to fail to appreciate that the Immigration Rules
       expressly  provide  a  discretion  to   request   missing   specified
       documents,  such  as  the  unaudited  accounts.  However,  it  became
       apparent at the first hearing before me that there were no  unaudited
       accounts extant at the relevant period, and so  to  that  extent  the
       failure to seek them was not material, for  had  their  absence  been
       identified as a matter that could be condoned  via  the  exercise  of
       discretion, they would not foreseeably have been  forthcoming  within
       the limited period provided for by the Missing document Rule.

   12. The hope for some pragmatic resolution of the appeal expressed in the
       grant of permission to appeal and the directions of Judge Rintoul was
       a perfectly reasonable one. However, Mr Clarke was entitled to resist
       the appeal as things stood at the April 2019 hearing, given  that  it
       remained the case at that date that a specified document had not been
       provided.

   13. It was accordingly  agreed  that  the  appeal  should  proceed  to  a
       continuation hearing in the Upper Tribunal subject  to  its  sensible
       resolution by agreement between the parties  via  the  provision  and
       acceptance of suitably audited accounts establishing earnings at  the
       relevant level. If the Appellant could meet the Rules, then  so  long
       as he had established family life (which given  the  relationship  is
       accepted as genuine is self-evidently the  case),  his  appeal  would
       inevitably succeed: see TZ (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA Civ 1109 �35.

   14. I expressed my hope at the April 2019 hearing that such an  agreement
       could be reached without a further full hearing. Happily  that  state
       of affairs has come to pass, Mr Clarke having written to the Tribunal
       prior to the May 2019 hearing confirming that the Secretary of  State
       was now satisfied that the Rules were met so no longer  resisted  the
       appeal. As I am assured  that  the  relevant  unaudited  accounts  do
       indeed satisfy the Rules, I find that the refusal of entry  clearance
       is now shown as inconsistent with the couple's Article 8  rights,  as
       the policy imperative of protecting public funds is not threatened by
       the grant of entry clearance. Accordingly the appeal is allowed.

  Decision

  The appeal is allowed.

  I do not make a costs order in  the  Appellant's  favour  as  the  appeal
  succeeded on post decision evidence.
