Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr G Lee, Counsel, instructed by McGarvey
                    Immigration and Asylum Practitioners Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of the Gambia and is 28 years of  age.   She
    initially entered the United Kingdom as a  student  and  since  January
    2008 has remained in the United Kingdom unlawfully.  She entered into a
    relationship with a Gambian national Mr AB who is a family member of an
    EEA national.  A child was born to that relationship on 22nd June 2012.
     That relationship has ended but the appellant's daughter continues  to
    see her  natural  father  and  enjoys  his  company  and  that  of  her
    stepsister.

2.   The appellant claimed asylum on 24th October 2014  on  the  basis  that
    she was a member of a particular group and was a parent of  a  daughter
    who was also at risk of the infliction of FGM on return to the  Gambia.
    The appellant also feared that she would be forced by her father into a
    marriage on return.  She attended an asylum interview on  20th  January
    2015 and her claim  was  refused  on  30th  March  2015.   Following  a
    successful appeal that decision was reconsidered, with  the  respondent
    maintaining refusal of the asylum claim in a decision of  16th  October
    2015.

3.   The appellant sought to appeal  against  that  decision,  which  appeal
    came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Coaster on 20th  May  2016.   Her
    appeal was dismissed in all respects.

4.   The appellant now seeks to appeal against that decision on a number  of
    grounds, contending that it is fundamentally  flawed  in  a  number  of
    aspects and that it should be set aside.  Permission was granted  on  a
    limited basis, namely that it was arguable that the Judge had not taken
    account of the frequent contact between the daughter  and  her  natural
    father when considering the best interests of the child.

5.   Thus it is that the matter comes before me to determine the issue.

6.   Mr Lee, who represents the appellant before me, makes in  effect  three
    submissions.  The first submission being that  the  way  in  which  the
    Judge dealt with delay in claiming asylum and credibility  amounted  to
    an error of law.  Secondly, that his approach to statistics was  flawed
    because on a reasonable reading of such statistics  there  was  a  real
    risk of FGM being caused.  Thirdly, that  the  Judge  had  been  unduly
    dismissive of family life as between daughter and natural father.

7.   The case as presented in summary had perhaps  three  distinct  elements
    to it.  The first related to the possible return to  the  household  of
    the appellant's parents.  Her mother was of  Wolof  ethnicity  and  her
    father Mandinka.  The Wolof is an ethnic group who do not practise  FGM
    whereas the Mandinka do.  Nevertheless, she had not  herself  been  the
    subject of FGM and her parents were opposed to it.  They were  well-off
    living in an urban area and it was the finding  of  the  Judge  that  a
    return to that environment would not expose the daughter  to  any  real
    risk.

8.   The second aspect  being  the  alleged  threats  and  interest  of  the
    father's parents who live in the Gambia.  Although the father also  was
    opposed to FGM, his parents wanted the child to be  circumcised.   They
    came from the Jola clan where it was almost  invariable  that  FGM  was
    practised.  It was argued on behalf of the appellant in the  course  of
    the appeal that they could assert  their  wishes  either  by  force  of
    cultural practice or by kidnapping the child.  The Judge did not accept
    the credibility of that aspect of the  claim  but  considered,  in  any
    event, that there would be little access in reality to the  child  even
    if  that  interest  were  expressed.   The  third  element  being   the
    suggestion by the appellant that her father would force  her  to  marry
    against her will.  That marriage it was said carried not only a risk of
    unpleasantness to her  but  also  increased  the  likelihood  that  the
    daughter would be sent to the parents of her  natural  husband  by  the
    person with whom she was  forced  to  marry.   The  Judge  for  various
    reasons did not accept the credibility of that contention, namely  that
    her father was seeking to force her into marriage.

9.   In terms of the potential threat to the child from the  parents  of  Mr
    AB and indeed credibility generally, the Judge at paragraph 67  of  the
    determination had regard to the timing of  the  appellant's  claim  for
    asylum.  She had given birth to a daughter in June  2012  but  had  not
    claimed asylum until October 2014, almost two and a half years later.

10.  Paragraph S339L(iv) of  the  Immigration  Rules  was  considered,  also
    Section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants,  etc.)
    Act 2004.  The appellant was aware of her former  partner's  ethnicity,
    they were both born and lived the majority of their lives in the Gambia
    and were very familiar with the traditions and customs  including  FGM.
    The Judge found that the lengthy delay of over  two  years  before  the
    appellant claimed asylum on behalf of herself and her daughter  on  the
    basis of being at risk on return to FGM in  the  Gambia  had  seriously
    damaged her credibility.

11.  This was particularly so as the appellant  had  claimed  that,  in  the
    months after the birth of her child, she had received the  threatening,
    harassing phone calls from the extended family.   If  that  claim  were
    true the appellant was clearly on notice  of  the  risk  on  return  to
    Gambia immediately after the birth of her daughter and  yet  failed  to
    make an early asylum claim.  She knew that her immigration  status  was
    precarious  and  it  was  only  after  two   failed   EEA   immigration
    applications were made that the claim for asylum was made and  as  such
    credibility undermined by the delay.  The Judge found  that  there  had
    been no threatening phone calls from the Gambia and that that aspect of
    the claim had been fabricated to lend credibility  to  the  appellant's
    asylum claim.  He also noted that  Mr  AB,  who  spoke  firmly  at  the
    hearing of the risk to his daughter if she were returned to the  Gambia
    and subjected to FGM by his family, would have raised this as a concern
    with the appellant after the daughter was born.  Significantly  he  had
    initially failed to support the appellant's asylum claim on  the  basis
    of the appellant and his daughter's risk of persecution.  This was only
    done after the appellant received the refusal letter.  It was  regarded
    therefore that that also undermined his credibility on this  particular
    matter.

12.   Mr Lee invited my attention to page 91 of the bundle and to  a  letter
    written  by  the  appellant  to  the  authorities  in  support  of   an
    application that she  made  for  her  daughter  to  be  regarded  as  a
    dependant of her father as an EEA family member.  There must have  been
    an earlier application because this letter  contained  the  request  to
    reconsider her application.  She wanted to take care of  her  daughter,
    finish her education and wanted to stay in the UK to bring up her child
    with her father around.  The letter went on:

         "And another thing I want to talk about is as a daughter from where
         I am from the Gambia she stand the chance to be circumcise which is
         not a good practise but they still do it because of traditions.   I
         hope I have made a very good point for myself and my child and hope
         to hear from you soon.  Thank you".

    There is no date to that letter but from the chronology set out in  the
    decision it would seem that an application for an  EEA  residence  card
    was made on 2nd May 2013 and refused on  27th  June  2013.   A  further
    application was made on 1st August 2013 and  refused  on  15th  January
    2014.  The nature of the refusal decisions have not  been  enclosed  in
    the papers.

13.  Mr Lee submits that the Judge failed to have regard to that  particular
    letter (presumably the one written on 1st August 2013) showing that the
    fear was raised with the authorities  at  that  stage  and  not  later.
    The refusal of the EEA applications was understandable given  that  the
    father was himself a dependant and not an EEA national  exercising  his
    own independent treaty rights.  It is far from clear whether he in  any
    sense supported those  applications  or  made  any  statements  to  the
    authorities about his daughter.  No evidence was adduced one way or the
    other on that aspect.

14.  Although I recognise the force of the argument, it seems to me that  it
    is a document which should be considered in the overall context.   Even
    if it had been considered by the Judge I do not find that it would have
    made any significant influence to the outcome of the overall  findings.
    The claim in the letter is couched  in  somewhat  vague  terms  and  no
    mention is made of the threats or of the request by the parents  of  Mr
    AB which, when considering that the application made was  precisely  to
    be linked with him, it  is  surprising  that  such  a  matter  was  not
    specifically raised.

15.  It is significant, as I so  find,  that  given  the  proximity  of  the
    events complained of to the birth of  the  child  it  would  have  been
    reasonable to have expected some more detailed mention  than  has  been
    made.  The first application for an EEA residence  card  seemingly  was
    made on 2nd May  2013  and  refused  on  27th  June  2013,  the  second
    application was made on 1st August 2013 and  refused  on  15th  January
    2014.  The tenor of the letter on page 91 would seem to  indicate  that
    it was written on the second application,  there  being  no  indication
    that any issue of FGM was mentioned on  the  first.   Given  that  both
    applications were for the daughter to be regarded as a dependant of her
    father, it would be reasonable to expect that the dangers posed to  her
    if she were removed would have been highlighted.  Replies from the Home
    Office to those applications are not in the bundle but Mr  Lee  accepts
    that it is likely if the matter of protection was noted by the decision
    maker that the appellant would have been advised to make  a  claim  for
    asylum through the usual channels.

16.  In any event the refusal was in January and no application  for  asylum
    was made  until  many  months  after.   There  is  no  indication  that
    throughout the process Mr AB played any significant part  or  made  any
    contribution to the authorities.

17.  In all the circumstances I find that the comments  made  by  the  Judge
    were properly made and that the Judge was entitled to consider that the
    failure to mention specific risk to the appellant's child at an earlier
    stage significantly undermined the credibility both  of  the  appellant
    and of Mr AB.  I find no error in that approach.

18.  The second challenge which is made relates to the nature  of  the  risk
    generally.  It was said by Mr Lee that the Judge has misunderstood  the
    prevalence of FGM in the  Gambia  and  has  failed  to  understand  the
    pressures upon young women to undergo FGM in order to have any  quality
    of life and a chance of marriage.

19.  I find little basis for  that  particular  challenge.   The  Judge  has
    looked with great care at the report by Jacqueline Kn�rr  and  has  set
    that report out in very considerable detail.  The Judge  has  also  set
    out why it is that little weight is given to certain of the conclusions
    set out therein.  The Judge has looked  at  the  leading  authority  in
    relation to clan membership and FGM in the case of K and  Others  [FGM]
    The Gambia CG [2013] UKUT 00062 (IAC) and indeed has set out very fully
    the relevant passages in  that  decision.   Indeed,  there  is  in  the
    determination a table setting out by tribe the various  percentages  of
    prevalence of FGM.  Detailed submissions by both sides are recorded and
    the risk to the appellant and  to  her  daughter  upon  return  to  her
    family, is dealt with in considerable detail at paragraph 65 with  some
    twelve items highlighted.  I find that the  Judge  has  undertaken  the
    analysis of the evidence with great care and  has  properly  considered
    the issues.  The finding that the appellant can safely return with  her
    daughter to her own family is properly reasoned.   The  challenge  made
    amounts to little more than an attempt to re-argue the  merits  of  the
    case.

20.  The third challenge, which is made,  relates  to  the  findings  as  to
    family life between daughter and father and it is upon this  particular
    ground that permission to appeal was  granted.   Mr  Lee  submits  that
    having regard to paragraphs 86 to 88 of  the  determination,  it  is  a
    fundamental error for the Judge to say that family life does not  exist
    between father and daughter.  It seems to me, however, that the  proper
    interpretation of the matter should be considered from paragraphs 86 to
    91 of the determination.  It is clear within  that  context  the  Judge
    recognised that there is limited family life with Mr AB.

21.  I note in that regard the witness  statement  from  Mr  AB  dated  21st
    August 2015.  It is significant that it  deals  very  little  with  the
    current relationship which he has  with  his  daughter.   Most  of  the
    statement is taken up with the potential threats to the  daughter  from
    his parents.  I find it surprising  that  there  is  little  about  the
    relationship itself.  When the appellant was in Aylesbury, it was  said
    that he saw his daughter every two or three days  and  that  she  would
    spend time with him and his daughter.  He himself had returned to visit
    the Gambia in February 2013 and February 2014.  The appellant moved  to
    Wales and the indication is that he did not see his daughter as  often.
    As I have indicated, the statement is  remarkably  silent  as  to  what
    contact he has and that to  some  extent  is  a  curiosity,  given  the
    evidence of the appellant as recorded in the determination and that  Mr
    AB now sees his daughter frequently,  the  appellant  having  moved  to
    London. His statement makes no reference to that.  The daughter  was  3
    years old as at the time of the hearing.  There is nothing to indicate,
    particularly in paragraph 88 of the determination, that the  Judge  has
    in any way misunderstood the nature of the contact which she  has  with
    her father.

22.  The Judge clearly has considered the best  interests  of  the  daughter
    and noted in particular the contact which her father  could  have  with
    her by telephone and other means.  Also by visits to the Gambia,  which
    he has made on a regular basis.  The daughter is very young  and  there
    is no evidence presented that physical separation from her father would
    be detrimental physically or emotionally.  It would seem that when  the
    family lived in Wales there was much less contact than currently.  As I
    have indicated, it is perhaps somewhat surprising that  Mr  AB  in  his
    evidence was not more forthcoming as to the nature of the  relationship
    which he now enjoys with her.

23.  Clearly this is a case where neither the  appellant  nor  her  daughter
    meet the Immigration Rules,  the  appellant  is  an  overstayer.    Her
    rights and those of  her  daughter  must  be  balanced  with  a  proper
    recognition of the importance of immigration control.  There is nothing
    in the analysis of the Judge to indicate that proportionality  has  not
    been properly and fairly considered.  It is clear that  the  Judge  has
    had in mind throughout that exercise the best interests of  the  child.
    The child will be returning with her mother to her mother's own  family
    which is supportive, on the  findings  the  Judge,  and  able  to  give
    attention both to the appellant and to her.  In terms of  the  fear  of
    the appellant being forced to marry, that was found not to be  credible
    for substantial reasons.

24.  Overall, I find that the conclusion of the  Judge  that  the  appellant
    and daughter can safely return to her parents  in  the  Gambia  without
    risk of FGM and other harm  is  a  properly  reasoned  and  sustainable
    decision.

25.  In those circumstances the appeal of the  appellant  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal against the decision of the  First-tier  Judge  is  dismissed.
    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand,  namely  that  the
    appeal of the appellant against  the  decision  of  the  respondent  is
    dismissed in respect of asylum and humanitarian protection and also  on
    human rights grounds.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
