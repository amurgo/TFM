                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State, for convenience I
    will refer to the  parties  as  they  appeared  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.




Introduction

 2.  The  appellants  are  citizens  of  Nigeria.   The  first  and  second
    appellants are a married couple who were born respectively on 17  April
    1983 and 5 September 1990.  The third appellant is their child who  was
    born in the United Kingdom on 18 July 2015.

Background

 3. The first appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 12 September  2007
    with entry clearance as a Tier 4  (General)  Migrant  and  leave  valid
    until 31 January 2009.  This leave was subsequently extended  until  30
    September 2009  during  which  time  he  studied  for  an  MBA  at  the
    University of Wales, Newport.

 4. On 4 August 2009, the first appellant  applied  for  extension  of  his
    leave as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Worker) Migrant which was  granted  on  4
    September 2009 until 4 September 2011.  He was subsequently granted  an
    extension of that leave until 28 March 2013.

 5.  During  this  time,  the  first  appellant  was  employed  by  various
    companies.  In February 2010, he set up his own  consultancy  business.
    In August 2010,  the  first  appellant  engaged  the  services  of  AGS
    Business Consultancy Limited ("AGS") to prepare his accounts in respect
    of his self-employment.  Those accounts  were  duly  prepared  for  the
    period 1 April 2010  to  30  November  2010.   It  would  appear  that,
    subsequently, those accounts were filed with HMRC in respect of the tax
    year 2010/2011.  In 2010, the first appellant set up his  own  company,
    Nininac Consultancy Limited which was incorporated on 26 November 2012.
     In order to prepare the necessary accounts for both that  company  and
    in respect of his employment, the first appellant engaged the  services
    of an accountant, TomFag LLP.

 6. On 21 February 2013, the first appellant applied for  an  extension  of
    his leave as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant and he was granted leave  until
    14 March 2016.

 7. On 4 March 2016, the first appellant made an application for indefinite
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant.  The Secretary of  State
    refused this application on 31 May  2016  on  the  basis  that  HMRC's
    records revealed that for the tax year 2010/2011  the  first  appellant
    had not declared his self-employed earnings which he had relied upon as
    part of the Tier 1 (General) Migrant application  he  had  made  on  21
    February 2013.

 8. Thereafter, through his accountant, TomFag  LLP,  the  first  appellant
    sought to rectify his declared income for the tax  year  2010/2011  and
    filed an amended tax return on 13 June 2016.  On  16  June  2016,  the
    first appellant's accountants notified the Secretary of State  of  this
    correction.  The tax and interest due on his self-employed  income  for
    the tax year 2010/2011 was paid on 26 July 2012.

 9. On 19 June 2016, the first appellant lodged an administrative review in
    respect of the Secretary of State's decision to refuse him  ILR  on  31
    May 2016 but, in a decision dated 26 July 2016, the Secretary of  State
    maintained her earlier decision.

10. On 8 August 2016 the first appellant submitted a second application for
    ILR but, on 15 October 2016, this application was rejected as  invalid
    due to the non-payment of fees.

11. The application was resubmitted on 26 October 2016.  The  Secretary  of
    State refused the application on 20 January 2017 on the same  basis  as
    the refusal on 31 May 2016.   Again,  the  first  appellant  lodged  an
    administrative review but the Secretary of State maintained the earlier
    decision on 1 March 2017.  A  judicial  review  of  that  decision  was
    unsuccessful when, following  an  oral  application  to  renew  seeking
    permission, permission was refused on 2 February 2018 by UTJ Kekic.

12. On 23 March 2018, the first appellant applied for leave  to  remain  on
    the basis of his private and family life in the UK.  On 17  July  2018,
    the Secretary of State refused the first appellant's application  under
    Art 8 of the ECHR.

13. The second appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 23 September 2018
    with entry clearance as a student valid until 31 October 2011.   On  26
    September 2011 she was granted leave to remain as a Tier 1  (Post-Study
    Worker) Migrant until 24 October 2013.  On 11 July 2013 she was granted
    further leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Migrant  until  10  April
    2015.

14. On 26 November  2014,  the  first  and  second  appellants  married  in
    Cardiff.

15. On 27 November 2014, the second appellant  made  an  application  as  a
    dependant of the first appellant as a Tier 1  (General)  Migrant.   She
    was granted leave until 14 March 2016 in line with that  of  the  first
    appellant.  The second appellant subsequently made applications in line
    with those as the first appellant as his dependant.

16. The third appellant, who is  the  daughter  of  the  first  and  second
    appellant, was born in the UK on 18 July 2015.  They also have  a  son,
    who is not a party to this appeal, who was born in the UK on 21  August
    2016.

17. Both the second and third appellants were refused leave and their Art 8
    claim rejected on 17 July 2018.

The Appeal

18. All three appellants appealed against decisions taken on 17  July  2018
    to refuse them leave under Art 8.

19. The appeal was listed on a number  of  occasions  in  Taylor  House  in
    London.  On 14 February 2019, the appeal was adjourned  apparently  on
    the basis that the Secretary of State wished to consider  the  position
    concerning the issue of "suitability".   This  arose  because,  in  the
    refusal decision of 17 July 2018, no issue had been taken in respect of
    the first  appellant's  "suitability"  based  upon  any  allegation  of
    dishonesty due to the discrepancy in his declared income  to  the  HMRC
    for  the  tax  year  2010/2011  and  his  income  relied  upon  in  his
    application for leave in 2013.  The appeal was again  adjourned  on  18
    July 2019.

20. On 2 August  2019,  the  Secretary  of  State  issued  a  supplementary
    decision in which the "suitability" point was taken against  the  first
    appellant under paras S-LTR.4.2 and S-LTR.1.6 of  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).   The Secretary of  State  noted
    that the first appellant had failed, in his declared income to HMRC for
    the tax year 2010/2011, to include any of  his  self-employment  income
    (namely the �17,972) that he had relied upon in  his  2013  application
    for leave and had  only  included  in  his  tax  return  for  2010/2011
    employed income of �19,171.   On the  basis  of  the  discrepancy,  the
    Secretary of State concluded that the first appellant had  "made  false
    representations or failed to disclose material facts" in  his  previous
    application (para S-LTR.4.2) and that his presence was not conducive to
    the public good because his conduct makes it undesirable to  grant  him
    leave to remain (para S-LTR.1.6).

21. Following a Case Management Hearing on 22 August 2019, the  appeal  was
    transferred to the Newport Hearing Centre and was listed  before  Judge
    Page on 24 October 2019.

The Judge Decision

22. The  appellants  were  unrepresented  before  Judge  Page.   The  first
    appellant gave oral evidence along with the second appellant's  sister.
    There was also evidence from the second appellant.  There were  several
    bundles of documents submitted on behalf of the  appellants.   Many  of
    these documents related to the substance of the Art 8 claim  and  their
    contention that their removal would be a disproportionate  interference
    with their private and family lives in the UK.

23. Judge Page dealt  first  with  the  respondent's  contention  that  the
    "suitability"  requirements  were  not  met  based   upon   the   first
    appellant's dishonesty in submitting discrepant figures for his  income
    in the tax year 2010/2011 in his HMRC tax return and to the  respondent
    as part of his 2013 application for leave.

24. It was accepted  by  the  first  appellant  that  his  tax  return  for
    2010/2011 omitted the whole of his self-employed income  for  that  tax
    year.  He, however, contended that that was an innocent mistake on  his
    part and the error was that of  his  first  accountant,  AGS.   In  his
    evidence, the first appellant set out his case that he had provided AGS
    with  all  the  documents,  including  his  self-employed  income   for
    2010/2011.  He understood that AGS had submitted his  profit  and  loss
    accounts to the HMRC.  He had only discovered that  this  was  not  the
    case when he received the respondent's refusal of his 2016  application
    for leave on 31 May 2016.  The first appellant's case was that  he  had
    then instructed his current accountants, TomFag LLP who  had  submitted
    an amended tax return to HMRC on13  June  2016.   HMRC  had  issued  an
    amended assessment and the outstanding tax and interest had  been  paid
    on 26 July 2016.  He had notified the respondent of this correction  in
    a letter dated 16 June 2016.  Those letters were contained  within  the
    appellants' main bundle of documents.

25. In addition, the first appellant said that he had sought to track  down
    his first accountants that he had used in 2010.  However, he  had  been
    unable to do so.  Although he had  found  a  company  trading  under  a
    similar name, it was in fact an entirely different  business.   He  had
    contacted various accounting bodies and he had been unable to find  the
    accountant who had prepared his tax return for 2010/2011.   In  support
    of that evidence, the first appellant relied upon a series  of  e-mails
    between himself and a number of accountancy organisations and a company
    with a similar name to AGS which were at pages 11-22 of the appellants'
    supplementary bundle of documents.

26. In his determination, Judge Page was plainly troubled by the  Secretary
    of State's decision-making process (see, e.g. para 24).  In particular,
    the fact that the issue of  suitability  had  not  been  taken  in  the
    initial decision of 17 July 2018 and was only subsequently relied  upon
    in the letter of 2 August 2019.

27. There is, no doubt, an apparent inconsistency  between  those  letters.
    Mr Howells, in his submissions, indicated that  it  would  appear  that
    there had been an oversight when the decision letter of  17  July  2018
    had been prepared as the suitability issue had already been  relied  on
    in the earlier decision of 31 May 2016.  That would seem, to me, to  be
    the likely explanation of why the decision letter of 17 July  2018  did
    not rely on the "suitability" requirement and the apparent  discrepancy
    in the first appellant's declared  income  which  had  previously  been
    relied upon in the decision letter of 31 May 2016.  That is, to say the
    least, most unfortunate and it has undoubtedly led to  delay  and  some
    confusion in the case.  However, there is nothing inconsistent  in  the
    Secretary of State indicating that both the letters of 17 July 2018 and
    2  August  2019  should  be  read  together  whilst  only  taking   the
    "suitability" point in  the  latter  decision  letter.   As  the  first
    appellant indicated to me at the hearing, he was plainly aware  at  the
    hearing before Judge Page that the suitability issue was  being  relied
    upon by the Secretary of State.

28. Having set out his concerns about the two decision letters, Judge  Page
    set out at para 10 that it was for the Secretary of State to  establish
    "dishonesty" on the part of the first appellant.   At  para  11,  Judge
    Page noted specifically that the burden of proof was upon the party who
    asserted it, namely the Secretary of State (see also para 18).

29. Then at paras 12-18, Judge Page set out his findings on  the  issue  of
    "dishonesty"  ultimately  concluding  that  the  respondent   had   not
    established that the first appellant was "dishonest" and  that  he  was
    satisfied that the first appellant had made a genuine error.  The judge
    said this:

         "12.     The respondent's  letter  dated  2  August  2019  makes  a
             rambling  reference  to  HMRC  records   under   the   heading
             'suitability'.  And goes on to say that there are  significant
             differences between HMRC records  and  the  appellant's  self-
             employed income.  I do not propose to set out here any attempt
             to unravel those confusing paragraphs but as I have said above
             the basic rule of litigation  is  that  he  who  asserts  must
             prove.  If the respondent is to make an  allegation  that  the
             appellant has acted dishonestly  then  I  expect  to  see  the
             evidence to which this letter refers to make  matters  clearer
             than this.  Nowhere in the respondent's  papers  have  I  been
             able to find the HMRC  records  to  which  the  respondent  is
             referring  or  indeed  the  earlier  applications   that   the
             appellant has made with copies of the documentation that he is
             said to have submitted.  All I have is this  rambling  account
             given in the letter  dated  2  August  2019  which  cannot  be
             reconciled with the respondent's decision dated 17 July  2018.
             In that  letter,  the  respondent  said  specifically  to  the
             appellant: 'your application does  not  fall  for  refusal  on
             grounds of suitability in Section S-LTR of Appendix  FM  under
             paragraph 276ADE(1)(i) of the Immigration Rules.'

         13.  Helpfully, the appellant in his bundle of  documents  prepared
             for the appeal for Taylor House on 7  February  2019  has,  at
             pages 206-301, included all of his HMRC records for the  years
             2010-2018, together with HMRC transactions confirming  one-off
             payments to clear outstanding tax for 2010-2011, which appears
             to  be  the  tax  year  of  the  respondent's  allegations  of
             dishonesty and  false  representations,  referred  to  in  the
             respondent's letter of 2 August 2019.  These assertions in the
             letter of 2 August 2019 are not evidence, without more,  that
             could discharge the burden of proof  upon  the  respondent  to
             prove dishonesty on the part of the appellant.  Allegations of
             dishonesty in a Home Office letter do not, without  supporting
             evidence, amount to evidence of dishonesty.   Such  assertions
             only evidence the Home Office allegation.

         14.  The appellant gave evidence before me and adopted the contents
             of his  witness  statement  dated  5  February  2019  and  the
             contents of his appellants' bundle of documents  at  pages  1-
             301.  It was  his  evidence  that  when  his  application  for
             indefinite leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General)  Migrant  was
             refused on 31 May  2016  on  the  basis  that  HMRC's  records
             revealed that for the tax year  2010-2011  he  had  not  fully
             declared the self-employed earnings, which he had relied  upon
             as part of his Tier 1 (General) Migrant application, this  was
             the first he knew about this.  He was adamant that this was  a
             genuine error that had since been remedied with an amended tax
             return, filed  with  the  HMRC  and  explaining  that  he  had
             identified an error.  The  respondent  was  notified  of  this
             correction by way of a letter dated 16 June 2016 and  the  tax
             and interest due was fully paid on 26 July 2016.  He asked for
             an administrative review of the respondent's decision, but  on
             26 July 2016 the respondent maintained the decision to refuse.



         15.  The evidence that there was an error is insufficient  evidence
             for the respondent to discharge the burden of proving that the
             appellant acted falsely, given the appellant's explanation and
             the supporting evidence that follows.

         16.  At page 226 of the appellants' bundle of documents is a letter
             from  TomFag  LLP  Chartered  Certified  Accountants  to   the
             Inspector of Tax, Self-Assessment, HMRC dated  13  June  2016.
             This stated they had identified errors in the  self-assessment
             return submitted by the appellant's former accountants for the
             tax years 2010-2011 and the request that an amendment  to  the
             return are shown in the list in the letter to be made and  for
             HMRC to recalculate the tax due and  update  its  records  and
             advise of the additional tax  payable  by  their  client  (the
             appellant) to enable him to make the necessary payment.   This
             shows that there was an underpayment of tax of  �5,032.99  for
             these years.  On the following pages there  are  HMRC  letters
             dated 11 August 2016, 26 January 2017 which records  that  the
             appellant's tax affairs [were] put in order by  31  July  2017
             [and] there was �3,538.35 to pay.  What is significant is that
             nowhere in the HMRC records, as far as I can see, is there any
             record of any penalty being imposed by the HMRC for failing to
             declare material earnings.   It  appears  that  the  HMRC  was
             satisfied with the explanation that an error had been made  by
             the appellant's former accountants.

         17.  Further, at page 234 of the appellants'  bundle,  there  is  a
             letter from TomFag Chartered Accountants to the  Visa  Officer
             dated 1 August 2016 which reports on the appellant's financial
             affairs.  This appears to be responding to a request from  the
             respondent to provide a report on  the  appellant's  financial
             and tax affairs.  This report is very detailed and has annexed
             to it the statutory account summary of invoices for the period
             1 December 2014 to 30 June 2016.

         18.  I will not  record  any  more  of  the  appellant's  financial
             documents.  As I have said above it is for the respondent  who
             is asserting that the appellant has acted dishonestly to prove
             dishonesty.  Nowhere in the respondent's papers is  there  any
             more than the allegation made in the  letter  dated  2  August
             2019, which, as  I  have  said  above,  contradicts  what  the
             respondent said in the letter dated 17  July  2018,  a  letter
             which is to be read in conjunction with the letter of 2 August
             2019.  The respondent has not begun to discharge the burden of
             proof to show that the appellant  has  acted  dishonestly.   I
             accept the appellant's evidence that there was an error by the
             appellant's first accountants  which  the  appellant's  second
             firm of accountants has rectified and the  appellant  did  not
             act dishonestly and that there has been a genuine  error  that
             he became aware of and rectified as soon as he could."

30. Having reached that finding, Judge Page then went on  to  consider  the
    substance of  the  appellants'  claim  under  Art  8  and  reached  the
    conclusion that their removal would be a disproportionate  interference
    with their private and family life and so he  allowed  the  appeals  of
    each appellant.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

31. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal challenging the judge's finding that the  respondent  had  not
    established  the  "suitability"  requirement  applied  to   the   first
    appellant, namely that that he was dishonest.  In essence, the  grounds
    contended that the judge had failed to apply the approach  set  out  by
    the Upper Tribunal for discrepant income declaration cases in R  (Khan)
    v SSHD (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph  322(5))  [2018]  UKUT  00384
    (IAC).  On 2 January  2020,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (DJ  Woodcraft)
    granted the Secretary of State permission to  appeal.   On  20  January
    2020, the appellants filed a detailed rule 24 response.

32. The appeals were initially listed before the Upper Tribunal on 26 March
    2020.  However, in the  light  of  the  Covid-19  crisis  and  national
    lockdown, the appeals were adjourned.

33. In response, the first appellant e-mailed the Upper Tribunal on 7 April
    2020 requesting that the appeal be relisted as soon as possible  either
    for a paper hearing or remote hearing by, for example, Skype.

34. The appeals were listed for a remote hearing by Skype for  Business  on
    10 September 2020 without objection from  either  party.   The  hearing
    took place with me based in the Cardiff Civil Justice  Centre  and  the
    appellants and Mr Howells joining the hearing  remotely  by  Skype  for
    Business.

The Submissions

35. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Howells  relied  upon  the  grounds  of
    appeal upon which permission to appeal had been granted.   He  accepted
    that the only issue before the Upper Tribunal was whether  the  judge's
    conclusion on the "suitability requirement", namely  that  it  had  not
    been established that the first appellant was "dishonest", was  legally
    sustainable.  Mr Howells acknowledged that the Secretary of  State  had
    not sought to challenge the substance of the judge's decision under Art
    8 and that if his finding on the "suitability" requirement was  upheld,
    then the Secretary of State's appeal  should  be  dismissed  and  Judge
    Page's decision to allow the appeal under Art 8 should stand.  However,
    Mr  Howells  submitted  that  if  the  finding  in  relation   to   the
    "suitability" requirement  could  not  stand,  that  would  affect  the
    judge's assessment  of  proportionality  and,  at  any  rehearing,  the
    substance of the Art 8 claim would be an issue.

36. Mr Howells submitted that the judge had failed to apply the  steps  set
    out in Khan in reaching his finding in  respect  of  "dishonesty".   Mr
    Howells made, in essence, two points.

37. First, in para 16 of his determination, the judge  had  been  wrong  to
    take into account, in his words, as "significant" that the HMRC had not
    imposed a penalty upon the first appellant  when  his  resubmitted  tax
    return for 2010/2011 was accepted.  Mr Howells submitted that was of no
    relevance as it did not indicate that HMRC accepted that the error  was
    'innocent'.  Mr Howells referred me  to  the  case  of  Balajigari  and
    Others v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 673  at  [66]-[67]  in  support  of  that
    submission.

38. Secondly, Mr Howells submitted that the judge  erred  in  reaching  his
    finding because  there  was  no  supporting  evidence  from  the  first
    appellant's initial accountant supporting the first  appellant's  claim
    that the mistake was that of his accountant  and  that  he  (the  first
    appellant) was innocent.  Mr Howells relied on paras (iv)  and  (v)  of
    the headnote in Khan that it was not  sufficient  to  simply  blame  an
    accountant for an error and that it was necessary to take into  account
    what, if any,  documentation  existed  for  example  of  correspondence
    between the individual and his accountant to support his claim that the
    error was that of his accountant  and  that  he  was  innocent  of  any
    dishonesty himself.  Mr  Howells  also  referred  me  to  the  case  of
    Balajigari which  had  approved  the  approach  in  Khan.   Mr  Howells
    submitted that whilst it was recognised that each case must  depend  on
    its facts, it was  unlikely  that  an  individual's  account  would  be
    accepted without support from his accountant.

39. In relation to that latter point, Mr Howells referred me  also  to  the
    cases of see Abbasi  (rule  43;  para  322(5):  accountants'  evidence)
    Pakistan [2020] UKUT 27 (IAC) and Ashfaq (Balajigari:  appeals)  [2020]
    UKUT 226 (IAC).  Mr Howells submitted that in Abbasi the UT found  that
    it was unlikely to place  any  particular  weight  on  an  accountant's
    letter unless the accountant gave evidence and signed  a  statement  of
    truth.  Further, in Ashfaq the UT  had  emphasised  the  importance  of
    evidence from an accountant as the individual's case of an error by the
    accountant went to that accountant's professional standing.

40. Finally, Mr Howells submitted that the judge had failed  to  take  into
    account, in  accordance  with  the  case  law,  that  the  accountant's
    obligation was to have the first appellant  sign  his  tax  return  for
    which he was personally responsible.

41. The first appellant sought to sustain Judge Page's factual finding.  He
    submitted that he  was  not  a  UK  qualified  accountant  and  he  had
    instructed an expert, upon whom he had relied, to file his  tax  return
    for 2010/2011.  He submitted that his accountant had submitted his  tax
    return and he had only become aware of the error when the  decision  of
    31 May 2016 was taken by the respondent.  The  first  appellant  relied
    upon the e-mail exchanges and submitted that he had tried his  best  to
    contact the first accountant to obtain evidence from him but  had  been
    unable to do so.  He was no longer  practicing.   The  first  appellant
    submitted that he had corrected, through his  current  accountant,  the
    error in his tax return as soon as he had become aware of it and it was
    relevant that this was his first tax return and he had made  no  errors
    thereafter.  He relied on the fact that HMRC had not imposed a  penalty
    upon him.  He invited me to uphold the judge's finding, which  accepted
    his explanation, that it was an innocent mistake and that  he  had  not
    been "dishonest".

Discussion

42. The issue of  whether  the  first  appellant  was  "dishonest"  in  his
    dealings with the  HMRC  and/or  the  respondent  in  relation  to  his
    earnings for the tax year 2010/2011 arose in his Art 8 claim by  virtue
    of para 276ADE(1)(i) which requires that the first appellant should not
    fall within the refusal grounds  in  the  "suitability"  provisions  in
    Section S-LTR in Appendix FM.  It is not disputed,  in  these  appeals,
    that the issue arose, in particular,  under  para  S-LTR.4.2.    It  is
    accepted by the respondent that it must be established that  the  first
    appellant was "dishonest" and the  burden  of  doing  so  is  upon  the
    respondent.

43. Judge Page correctly directed himself on those latter matters at  paras
    10-12 of his determination.

44. Mr Howells relied upon the headnote in Khan (in particular  paras  (iv)
    and (v)), summarising the views of the Martin Spencer J:

         "(i) Where there has been  a  significant  difference  between  the
             income claimed in a previous application for leave  to  remain
             and the income declared to HMRC, the  Secretary  of  State  is
             entitled to draw an inference  that  the  Applicant  has  been
             deceitful or dishonest and therefore he should be refused  ILR
             within paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules.   Such  an
             inference could  be  expected  where  there  is  no  plausible
             explanation for the discrepancy.

         (ii) Where an  Applicant  has  presented  evidence  to  show  that,
             despite  the  prima  facie  inference,  he  was  not  in  fact
             dishonest but only careless, then the Secretary of State  must
             decide whether the explanation and evidence is sufficient,  in
             her  view,  to  displace  the   prima   facie   inference   of
             deceit/dishonesty.

         (iii)    In approaching that fact-finding task,  the  Secretary  of
             State should remind herself that,  although  the  standard  of
             proof is the "balance of probability", a finding that a person
             has been deceitful  and  dishonest  in  relation  to  his  tax
             affairs with the consequence that he is denied  settlement  in
             this  country  is  a  very  serious   finding   with   serious
             consequences.

         (iv) For an Applicant simply to blame his or her accountant for  an
             "error" in relation to the historical tax return will  not  be
             the end of the matter,  given  that  the  accountant  will  or
             should have asked the tax payer to confirm that the return was
             accurate and to have signed the tax  return.  Furthermore  the
             Applicant will have known of his or her earnings and will have
             expected to pay tax thereon.  If the Applicant does  not  take
             steps within a reasonable time to remedy  the  situation,  the
             Secretary of State may  be  entitled  to  conclude  that  this
             failure justifies a conclusion that there has been  deceit  or
             dishonesty.

         (v)  When considering whether or not the Applicant is dishonest  or
             merely careless the Secretary of  State  should  consider  the
             following matters, inter alia, as well as the extent to  which
             they are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):

             i.   Whether the explanation for the error by  the  accountant
                  is plausible;

             ii.  Whether the documentation which can be assumed  to  exist
                  (for example, correspondence between the Applicant and his
                  accountant at  the  time  of  the  tax  return)  has  been
                  disclosed or there is a plausible explanation for  why  it
                  is missing;

             iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that an error had  been
                  made because his liability to pay tax  was  less  than  he
                  should have expected;

             iv.  Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken  steps  to
                  remedy the situation and, if so,  when  those  steps  were
                  taken and the explanation for any significant delay."

45. In Balajigari, the Court of Appeal largely  approved  the  approach  of
    Martin Spencer J in Khan (at [40]-[44])  with  one  caveat.   At  [42],
    Underhill LJ (with whom Hickinbottom and Singh LJJ agreed), pointed out
    a "danger" in the  "starting-point"  in  paras  (i)  and  (ii)  of  the
    headnote as follows:

         "42. Although Martin Spencer J clearly makes  the  point  that  the
         Secretary of State must carefully consider any case  advanced  that
         the  discrepancy  is  the  result  of  carelessness   rather   than
         dishonesty, there is in our view a danger that his "starting-point"
         mis-states  the  position.  A  discrepancy  between  the   earnings
         declared to HMRC and to the Home Office may justifiably  give  rise
         to a suspicion that it is the result of dishonesty but it does  not
         by itself justify a conclusion to that effect. What it does  is  to
         call for an explanation. If  an  explanation  once  sought  is  not
         forthcoming, or is unconvincing, it may at that point be legitimate
         for the Secretary of State to infer dishonesty; but  even  in  that
         case the position is not that  there  is  a  legal  burden  on  the
         applicant to disprove  dishonesty.  The  Secretary  of  State  must
         simply decide, considering the discrepancy  in  the  light  of  the
         explanation (or lack of it),  whether  he  is  satisfied  that  the
         applicant has been dishonest."

46. At [43], the Court approved Martin Spencer J's  view  at  [30(iii)]  in
    Khan that the standard of proof was a "balance  of  probabilities"  but
    that a finding  of  dishonesty  was  a  serious  finding  with  serious
    consequences.  Underhill LJ said this:

         " ...despite the valiant attempts made by Ms Anderson on behalf  of
         the Secretary of State before us to argue the contrary, we consider
         (as Martin Spencer J did) that the concept of standard of proof  is
         not inappropriate in the present context. This is because  what  is
         being asserted by the Secretary of State is that an  applicant  for
         ILR has been dishonest. That is a serious allegation, carrying with
         it serious consequences. Accordingly, we agree with Martin  Spencer
         J that the Secretary of State must be satisfied that dishonesty has
         occurred, the standard of proof being the balance of  probabilities
         but bearing in mind the serious nature of the  allegation  and  the
         serious  consequences  which  follow  from  such   a   finding   of
         dishonesty."

47.  Balajigari  and  Khan  were  concerned  with  decision-making  by  the
    Secretary of State, rather than with decisions made on appeal by Judges
    of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Nevertheless,  the   views   expressed
    concerning the approach of a decision maker are equally  applicable  to
    an  appeal  when  a  judge  determines  whether  the   respondent   has
    established that an appellant was dishonest.

48. The decision in Khan  (as  approved  in  Balajigari)  did  not,  in  my
    judgment, set out a straightjacket as to the approach  that  should  be
    followed by a decision maker in  reaching  a  decision  on  whether  an
    individual has acted dishonestly.   The  decision  provides  a  helpful
    guide, and no more than  that,  as  to  how  a  decision  maker  should
    approach that task.  The Court of Appeal in Balajigari noted (at  [40])
    the points made in Khan were "by way of general guidance".   The  Court
    clearly took the view that each  case  must  turn  upon  an  individual
    factual assessment.  Of course, in an appeal a judge is likely to  have
    the advantage of hearing an  appellant  give  evidence  and  be  cross-
    examined.  In a case where there is no appeal, but there is a challenge
    by way of judicial review to the Secretary of State's  decision,  there
    will, at best, have been an interview which the  individual  will  have
    been given an opportunity to deal with any  allegation  of  dishonesty.
    Indeed, as a requirement of fairness that was one of the issues decided
    by the Court of Appeal in Balajigari.  That is  likely  to  be  a  less
    informative exercise than if the individual gives evidence and is cross-
    examined by a representative of the Secretary of State and a  judge  is
    then required to make an assessment of that individual's credibility.

49. Nevertheless, the case law beginning in Khan and concluding  in  Abbasi
    and Ashfaq, does emphasise that an individual's claim  that  any  error
    was that of their accountant, and not  dishonestly  made  by  them,  is
    likely to need to be supported by evidence from  that  accountant  (see
    Khan at [37(vii)]).  So, in Abbasi the UT stated, as  set  out  in  the
    judicial headnote, that:

         "...  where  an  individual  relies  upon  an  accountant's  letter
         admitting fault in the submission of incorrect tax returns  to  Her
         Majesty's Revenue and Customs, the First-tier or Upper Tribunal  is
         unlikely to place  any  material  weight  on  that  letter  if  the
         accountant does  not  attend  the  hearing  to  give  evidence,  by
         reference to a Statement of Truth,  that  explains  in  detail  the
         circumstances in which the error came to be  made;  the  basis  and
         nature of any compensations; and whether the firm's insurers and/or
         any  relevant  regulatory  body  has  been   informed.    This   is
         particularly so where the letter is clearly perfunctory in nature."



50. Likewise, in Ashfaq, as set out in the judicial headnote, the UT stated
    that:

         "The explanation by any accountant said to have made or contributed
         to an error is essential because the allegation of  error  goes  to
         the accountant's professional standing.  Without evidence from  the
         accountant, the Tribunal may consider that the facts  laid  by  the
         Secretary of State establish the appellant's dishonesty."

51. The forensic importance of evidence from the accountant  who  submitted
    the tax return, and indeed oral evidence or  evidence  supported  by  a
    statement  of  truth  from  him,  is  emphasised  in  these  decisions.
    However, the decisions are necessarily  made  in  the  context  of  the
    "general  guidance"  given  in  Khan  and  approved  in  substance   in
    Balajigari.  In  Khan,  Martin  Spencer  J  acknowledged  that  it  was
    relevant to take into account "a plausible explanation" why  supporting
    evidence from an accountant was missing (see  [37(vi)ii)]).  I  do  not
    understand the UT in any of the subsequent decisions to have laid  down
    as a legal requirement that in  order  to  succeed  an  appellant  must
    produce supporting evidence from the relevant accountant.

52. Production of such evidence may  be  expected  but  it  cannot,  in  my
    judgment, be a mandatory requirement without which the appellant  would
    not be able to shift the evidential burden by establishing an  innocent
    explanation so that the  respondent  will  have  discharged  the  legal
    burden of establishing dishonesty on the part of the individual.   When
    I put this point to Mr Howells, he submitted  that  such  evidence  was
    mandatory, and an individual would necessarily fail in establishing the
    innocent explanation without such  evidence.   I  do  not  accept  that
    submission for the reasons I have given.  There may be cases  where  it
    is simply impossible, or not reasonably practicable, to obtain evidence
    from the initial accountant.  The accountant  may  be  untraceable  (as
    appears to have  been  the  case  in  this  appeal)  or  no  longer  be
    practising or willing to assist the appellant in presenting their case.
     An individual's case may not  be  as  strong  without  the  supporting
    evidence from an accountant, but, applying a  fact-sensitive  approach,
    an individual's case cannot always be impossible of proof without  such
    evidence.

53. Each case will depend upon an assessment  of  the  evidence  available,
    including the underlying creditworthiness (or not)  of  the  individual
    and what, if any, other documentary  evidence  exists  to  support  the
    individual's case.

54. In this appeal, the first appellant put before Judge Page a series of e-
    mails from him to, for example, accountancy bodies and  others  seeking
    to trace his initial accountant.  He drew a blank.  Whilst  Judge  Page
    made no specific reference to these e-mails, he clearly had in mind the
    extensive documentary evidence which was relied on  before  him.   This
    evidence was supportive of the first appellant's claim that the mistake
    was that of his first accountant and that he had tried to  contact  him
    in order to provide evidence of his dealings with  the  accountant  and
    the submission of his 2010/2011  accounts  to  HMRC.   The  absence  of
    direct evidence from the accountant, in these  circumstances,  was  not
    necessarily fatal to the appellants'  claim  being  accepted  by  Judge
    Page.

55. Turning to the other points relied upon by Mr Howells, I agree that the
    judge (at para 16 of his determination)  overstated  the  relevance  of
    HMRC not imposing any penalty upon the first appellant when his revised
    tax return for 2010/2011 was accepted.   As  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
    Balajigari noted at [66] and [67], an error of this sort  simply  means
    that a penalty could be imposed.  The  Court  rejected  the  contention
    made in Balajigari that the HMRC had a duty  to  impose  a  penalty  in
    every case.  It cannot, therefore, be presumed that when a  penalty  is
    not imposed that is because the HMRC has taken any particular  view  as
    to the culpability of the individual; in particular has determined that
    the individual was not dishonest.  It is a neutral factor.  I  do  not,
    however, read Judge Page's reference to this in  para  16  as  anything
    more than a recognition - despite his use of the word  "significant"  -
    that HMRC had not imposed a penalty followed by an observation that  it
    "appears" HMRC might have accepted the first appellant's claim that  it
    was an error by his accountant.  In any event, even if  the  judge  did
    take it into account,  the  bulk  of  his  decision  on  the  issue  of
    dishonesty is concerned with his  assessment  of  the  first  appellant
    having heard him give evidence and having been cross-examined.

56. The final point relied upon by Mr Howells is that, taking into  account
    what was said in Khan at para (iv) of the headnote, Judge  Page  failed
    to take into account that the first appellant would have been asked  to
    confirm that his tax return  was  accurate  and  sign  it  and  he  was
    responsible for its contents.

57. Of course, simply to have signed a document is not necessarily to  have
    read, or to be aware of, its contents.  Likewise, formal responsibility
    for the contents  of  a  tax  return  does  not  necessarily  mean  the
    individual is aware of  its  contents  or  that  the  contents  are  an
    inaccurate reflection of his tax affairs.  Further, the later lower tax
    liability - particularly  if  substantial  -  is  likely  to  call  for
    explanation.  Also, an acceptable explanation can be  forthcoming  even
    if a court of tribunal is entitled to be sceptical of  mere  assertions
    put forward by an individual.   In Khan, Martin Spencer J  rejected  as
    "too broad or extreme" (at [34]):

         "a proposition to suggest that it cannot be a defence for a  person
         who has been refused ILR...on the basis of  a  discrepancy  between
         his tax return and a previous application for leave  to  stay  that
         his account or agent was responsible for  the  discrepancy  on  the
         basis that each person is personally responsible for  his  own  tax
         matters and dealings with HMRC. Otherwise, whenever  she  discovers
         such a discrepancy, the Secretary of State  would  be  entitled  to
         refuse ILR without further consideration  of  the  reason  for  the
         discrepancy and whether it in fact betrays a lack of honesty on the
         part of the Applicant. Thus, it seems to me that  an  error  by  an
         accountant may afford a reason for an Applicant to show that he has
         not been dishonest but, at most,  careless  (or  perhaps  even  not
         that). Thus, whilst it would normally be the case that an Applicant
         would soon become aware of the error because of his unexpected lack
         of a liability to pay tax, if the Applicant could show that he  was
         so distracted by other matters - here  the  serious  illness  of  a
         child  undergoing  life  saving  brain  surgery   with   subsequent
         treatment, rehabilitation and chemotherapy - then the Secretary  of
         State would have to consider very carefully  whether  that  did  in
         fact afford a good reason for the Applicant's failure to appreciate
         that his tax liability was less than expected and therefore  notify
         the authorities sooner than he had done so."

58. The "explanations" given in Khan are only examples.  Other explanations
    might be given which,  if  credible  and  accepted,  would  support  an
    individual's claim not to have been dishonest.

59. Judge Page was, no doubt, well  aware  of  this  point  which  will  be
    familiar to any taxpayer who completes a tax return to HMRC.  The first
    appellant's evidence was that he had not been aware of the  failure  to
    include his self-employed income, the relevant documents for  which  he
    had provided  to  his  accountant.   Judge  Page  also  had  the  first
    appellant's evidence about his background, which did not  include  that
    he was a person likely to have an understanding of the detail  of  HMRC
    procedure and tax matters, and  also  the  first  appellant's  account,
    supported by the documentary evidence, that  this  was  his  first  tax
    return involving self-employed  income  and  that  his  subsequent  tax
    returns had been complete and accurate.  It was, therefore,  a  one-off
    error.  He had  corrected  the  error,  through  his  new  accountants,
    immediately the discrepancy was identified in the decision  of  31  May
    2016.

60. It is important to bear in mind that the burden of proof was  upon  the
    respondent and, although I accept the discrepancy raised, as the  Court
    of Appeal put it in Balajigari at [42], a  "suspicion"  of  dishonesty,
    the first appellant offered an explanation  with  some  (but  not  all)
    supporting documentation.  The Secretary of State  had  the  burden  of
    proof which was to be satisfied on  a  balance  of  probabilities  but,
    again as the Court  of  Appeal  pointed  out  in  Balajigari  at  [43],
    "bearing in mind the serious nature of the allegation and  the  serious
    consequences which follow from such a  finding  of  dishonesty."    The
    crucial issue was one of fact.  The finding of facts is  essentially  a
    matter for a trial judge in a court or tribunal.  An appellate court or
    tribunal should be cautious in interfering with a factual finding based
    upon all  the  evidence  and  should  only  do  so  if  the  judge  has
    misdirected himself in law or the findings reached are inadequately  or
    irrationally reasoned or the decision reached is itself  an  irrational
    one.  The caution is particularly important where the  factual  finding
    involves an assessment of the credibility of  an  individual  who  gave
    oral evidence before the judge.   Here,  the  Secretary  of  State  was
    represented and, no doubt, her representative cross-examined the  first
    appellant on the relevant matters in seeking to establish that  he  was
    dishonest.   The  judge  formed  a  view  of  the   first   appellant's
    credibility.  That was highly relevant in assessing whether his account
    that he did not realise, and therefore it was not due to dishonesty  on
    his part, that his tax return for 2010/2011 had not included his  self-
    employed income.

61. In my judgment, Judge Page was entitled to accept the first appellant's
    evidence of how the discrepancy in his income declared to HMRC, on  the
    one hand, and to the Secretary of State, on the other hand, arose.   He
    was not required by the "general guidance" in Khan and subsequent cases
    to inevitably  reach  a  different  conclusion.   That  conclusion  was
    reasonably open to him, even if not all judges would  necessarily  have
    reached the conclusion Judge Page did.  His reasons  are  adequate  and
    sufficient to sustain, particularly given his acceptance of  the  first
    appellant's oral evidence, his finding  that  the  respondent  had  not
    discharged the burden of proof on a balance of probabilities  that  the
    first appellant was dishonest.

62. Consequently, I reject the Secretary of State's grounds of appeal.  The
    judge did not err in law in reaching his finding that the "suitability"
    requirement - which entailed proof of dishonesty by the first appellant
    - was not established by the respondent.

63. As I have already indicated, Mr Howells accepted that, if  the  judge's
    finding in  relation  to  the  issue  of  dishonesty  was  upheld,  the
    Secretary of State's appeal to  the  UT  should  be  dismissed  as  the
    Secretary of State had not challenged  the  substance  of  the  judge's
    decision to allow the appeal under Art 8.

Decision

64. For the above reasons, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow
    the appellants' appeals under Art 8 of the ECHR  did  not  involve  the
    making of an error of law.  That decision, therefore, stands.

65. Accordingly, the Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
    dismissed.
