For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is an appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal,  with  permission,  by  the
      Appellant in relation to a Decision  and  Reasons  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal (Judge Wilson) promulgated  on  9th  May  2016  by  which  he
      dismissed the Appellant's appeal  against  the  Secretary  of  State's
      decision to refuse to issue her with a Residence card as  an  extended
      family member of an EEA national exercising Treaty Rights in the UK.

   2. Permission to appeal was granted on 28th July 2016.


   3. However on 19th  September  2016  the  Upper  Tribunal  published  its
      decision in Sala (EFMs: Right of Appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411 (IAC) which
      found that extended family members have no  right  of  appeal  to  the
      First-tier Tribunal.

   4. In light of Sala and in line with it I find as follows:

   5. The Appellant has no right of appeal.  The First-tier Tribunal had  no
      jurisdiction to hear the appeal.  It erred in law in doing so.

   6. I set aside the decision and substitute a decision that there was  not
      a valid appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.


Signed                              Date 18th November 2016
