Regulation 15(1)(b) of the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations
2006 applies to those who entered a  genuine  marriage  where  both  parties
have resided in the United Kingdom for five years since  the  marriage;  the
EEA national's spouse has resided  as  the  family  member  of  a  qualified
person or otherwise in accordance with the Regulations and the marriage  has
not been dissolved. The "residing with" requirement relates to  presence  in
the UK; it does not require living in a common family home.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

           1. This is an appeal from a decision of  Immigration  Judge  (IJ)
              Harmston given on the 16 March 2010 upholding the respondent's
              refusal of 16 January 2010  to  issue  the  appellant  with  a
              permanent  residence  card   under   reg   15(1)(b)   of   the
              Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  SI
              2006/1003 ("the Regulations").


           2. The material facts can be taken from the decision  of  the  IJ
              and may be summarised as follows:-

                    i) the appellant is a Turkish national   now  28  years
                       old;


                   ii) she first came to the UK in September 2001 when  she
                       had entry clearance for two years as an au pair;

                  iii) a few months later she met PM, an  Italian  national
                       exercising Treaty rights by working in the UK;

                   iv) the couple started cohabiting as  man  and  wife  in
                       September 2003  by  which  time  the  appellant  had
                       secured an extension of her stay;

                    v) on the 21 February 2004 the couple married  and  the
                       appellant gave birth to their son Leo  on  6  August
                       2004;

                   vi) in April 2004 the appellant was  given  a  residence
                       card as the spouse of an EEA national for  a  period
                       of 5 years until 29 March 2009;

                  vii) in December 2007 PM left the  matrimonial  home  and
                       the couple have not cohabited since;

                 viii) they remain married to  each  other  and  in  social
                       contact with each other. PM visits his son  twice  a
                       week and provides financial support in  the  sum  of
                       �50.

           3. In 2009 the appellant applied for  permanent  residence.  This
              was refused on the basis that there was insufficient  evidence
              that PM had worked for the requisite period and  thus  resided
              in the United Kingdom for five years in  accordance  with  the
              Regulations. This issue of fact was decided in favour  of  the
              appellant by the IJ and is no longer in contention.


           4. The IJ nevertheless dismissed the appeal because  he  was  not
              satisfied that the appellant had resided in the United Kingdom
              with PM for five years. Permission to appeal  to  the  UT  was
              granted by SIJ Nichols on 22 April and the appeal heard by SIJ
              Perkins on 3 September 2010.

           5. On 13 October 2010 he decided that the appeal should be  heard
              by a panel of this chamber for consideration to  be  given  to
              whether a reference needs to be made to the Court  of  Justice
              of the European Union (CJEU) as  to  the  meaning  of  Article
              16(2) of Directive 2004/38/EC (the  Citizens  Directive)  that
              the Regulations endeavour to transpose into national law.

           6. We heard the appeal on 21 December 2010. Having heard from  Ms
              Saunders in  response  to  Mr  Berry's  skeleton  argument  we
              indicated that:

                    i) the IJ made a material error of law;

                   ii) we would set aside the decision and remake it on the
                       basis of the factual findings reached below;

                  iii) we could decide this appeal without the need to make
                       a reference to the CJEU  since  we  could  find  the
                       meaning of the legislative provisions in issue  with
                       complete confidence;

                   iv) the appeal was allowed and directions given that the
                       appellant be issued with a permanent residence card;

                    v) we would  give  our  reasons  in  writing  for  this
                       conclusion as soon as practicable.

The Regulations

           7. Regulation 15(1) provides as follows:


              " The following persons shall acquire the right to reside  in
             the United Kingdom    permanently -

               (a) an EEA national who has resided in the United Kingdom in
                  accordance with these Regulations for a continuous  period
                  of five years;


               (b) a family member of an EEA national who is not himself an
                  EEA national but who has resided  in  the  United  Kingdom
                  with the EEA national in accordance with these Regulations
                  for a continuous period of five years;


               (c)  a  worker  or  self-employed  person  who  has   ceased
              activity;


               (d)     the family  member  of  a  worker  or  self-employed
                  person who has ceased activity;


               (e)     a person who was the family member of  a  worker  or
                  self-employed person where -


                        i) the worker or self-employed person has died;


                      (ii)         the  family  member  resided  with   him
                           immediately before his death; and


                      (iii)       the worker or  self-employed  person  had
                           resided continuously in the United Kingdom for at
                           least the two years immediately before his  death
                           or the death was the result  of  an  accident  at
                           work or an occupational disease;


                  f) a person who -


                      (i)   has resided in the United Kingdom in accordance
                           with these Regulations for a continuous period of
                           five years; and


                      (ii)  was, at the end of that period, a family member
                           who has retained the right of residence."



           8. Regulation 15(1)(a) and (b) both refer to a  person  "who  has
              resided  in  the  United  Kingdom  in  accordance  with  these
              Regulations for a continuous period of five years". Regulation
              15(1)(a) deals with EEA nationals while reg 15(1)(b)  concerns
              a family member of an EEA national who is not herself  an  EEA
              national; in such a case the words "with the EEA national" are
              added after the United Kingdom.

           9.  Before  us  the  parties  were  agreed  that  the  issue   of
              construction is whether  the  words  "resided  in  the  United
              Kingdom with the EEA national" mean:


                   i) The family member (in this case the spouse)  and  the
                      EEA national must  both reside in the United  Kingdom
                      for the requisite period, or


                  ii) The family member should  be  residing  in  a  common
                      family home with  the  EEA  national  in  the  United
                      Kingdom for the requisite period.

          10. The IJ concluded that the second meaning was the correct  one.
              In reaching this conclusion  he considered  that  support  for
              this conclusion could be found in the reported decision of the
              AIT  in OA (EEA-retained right of  residence)  Nigeria  [2010]
              UKAIT 00003  a judgment of SIJ Storey.  The IJ was wrong about
              that. The decision was concerned  with  a  retained  right  of
              residence  under regulation 15(1)(f) and turned on  the  point
              that the EEA national in that case  had  not  worked  for  the
              requisite period and thus could not show that he  had  resided
              in the United Kingdom in accordance with the Regulations.  For
              the same reason the family member could not qualify under  reg
              15(1)(b) and at [22] the AIT stated it was  not  necessary  to
              consider the precise meaning  of  the  phrase  "with  the  EEA
              national".


          11. No other national case law was referred to by either side, and
              we are aware of none.  We  will  first  consider  whether  the
              meaning can be discerned from the language of  the  regulation
              itself and its relevant context, before considering  Community
              legislation and case law.

       The text of the Regulations

          12. As to the words used, we note first that the words  "with  the
              EEA  national"  come  after  "United  Kingdom".  Putting   the
              disputed words in parenthesis, the  words  appear  to  address
              attention to the question  of  whether  the  non-EEA  national
              family member has resided in the United Kingdom as opposed  to
              elsewhere.

                  "a family member of an EEA national who is not himself  an
                  EEA national but who has resided  in  the  United  Kingdom
                  (with  the  EEA  national)  in   accordance   with   these
                  Regulations for a continuous period of five years;

          13. Second, that the  regulation  is  concerned  with  any  family
              member  and  not  just  spouses,  and   cannot  therefore   be
              construed as meaning "living together as husband or  wife"  or
              conjugal cohabitation.  The range of family members within the
              ambit of reg 15(1)(b) includes children under 21 and dependent
              relatives in the ascending and descending line (see reg 7).


          14. Third, the legislator has not used words such as "resided as a
              member of the household in the United Kingdom"  (contrast  the
              provision for extended family members in reg 8).

          15. Each of these observations is a pointer to the  first  of  the
              two possible meanings being the appropriate one.

      The context of the words to be construed

          16.  Turning  to  the  context  of  the  regulations,  the  scheme
              (reflecting the requirements  of  Community  law)  deals  with
              initial residence, then extended  rights  of  residence,  next
              retained rights of residence and finally permanent  rights  of
              residence. Regulation 13(2)  concerns  the  right  of  initial
              residence of a non-EEA family member of an EEA national.   The
              position of such a family member is distinguished from that of
              EEA nationals by the requirement to produce a valid  passport,
              but otherwise the initial right of residence is not  expressed
              to be  subject  to  a  requirement  to  reside  with  the  EEA
              national. No distinction  is  made  between  EEA  and  non-EEA
              family members for the  purposes  of  the  extended  right  of
              residence under reg 14(2). All family members are entitled  to
              extended residence as long  as  the  EEA  national  remains  a
              qualified person (in the present context this means  works  in
              the UK) or  has  become  entitled  to  a  permanent  right  of
              residence. There is no requirement that the family  member  be
              residing with the EEA national in the same house or household.



          17. Both sides recognise that the European Court  of  Justice  has
              dealt with the extended right of residence in Community law in
              the case of C/267-83 Diatta v Land Berlin [1985] ECR 567. This
              was a decision concerned with  EEC  Regulations  1612/68.  The
              Court said this:

                  "17. Having regard to its context and the objectives which
                  it  pursues,  that   provision   cannot   be   interpreted
                  restrictively.

                  18. In providing that  a  member  of  a  migrant  worker's
                  family has the right to install himself with  the  worker,
                  article 10 of the Regulation does  not  require  that  the
                  member of the family in  question  must  live  permanently
                  with the worker, but, as is clear from article 10(3), only
                  that the accommodation which the worker has available must
                  be such as may be considered normal  for  the  purpose  of
                  accommodating his family. A requirement  that  the  family
                  must live under the same roof permanently
                  cannot be implied.

                  19. In addition such an interpretation corresponds to  the
                  spirit of article 11 of the regulation,  which  gives  the
                  member of the family the right to take up any activity  as
                  an employed person throughout the territory of the  Member
                  State concerned, even though that activity is exercised at
                  a place some distance from the  place  where  the  migrant
                  worker resides.

                  20. It must be added that the marital relationship  cannot
                  be regarded as dissolved  so  long  as  it  has  not  been
                  terminated by the competent authority. It is not dissolved
                  merely because the spouses  live  separately,  even  where
                  they intend to divorce at a later date."

          18. Ms  Saunders  informed  us  that  her  policy  department  had
              instructed her that Diatta provided  a  cogent  indication  of
              what the content of the permanent right  of  residence  should
              consist  of,  although  the  IJ  did  not  agree   with   this
              proposition when first advanced on behalf  of  the  appellant.
              She accepted that the  IJ  did  not  have  the  benefit  of  a
              submission on this question from the respondent as the initial
              refusal was based on the proposition that the husband had  not
              worked for five years.


          19. For our part we recognise that while the decision in Diatta is
              highly influential as to the proper construction of Regulation
              1612/68 it cannot be decisive on the question since it  was  a
              decision on  the  meaning  of  different  words  and  was  not
              concerned with a permanent right of residence.


          20. Turning to reg 15 itself, we  are  struck  with  the  contrast
              between 15(1)(a) and (b). If the IJ's  conclusion  is  correct
              then (assuming in both cases that the EEA national has resided
              in the United Kingdom in accordance  with  these  Regulations)
              there is a very significant difference in treatment of  family
              members depending on their nationality.  A French spouse of an
              Italian  national  obtains  permanent  residence  without  any
              requirement to reside with the EEA national. A Turkish spouse,
              such as the appellant, can never obtain permanent residence if
              the EEA spouse never established a common matrimonial home  or
              moves out of it before the expiry of the period of five years.
              Such a  startling  distinction  in  treatment  would  be  very
              surprising when the basic definition of family member  affords
              no decisive importance to the nationality of that person.

          21. Moreover, it is common ground that no distinction is  made  on
              the grounds of  the  nationality  of  the  family  member  who
              obtains a permanent right of residence  in  the  circumstances
              set out in reg 15(1)(b) (e) or (f).  Thus in the circumstances
              set out in  those  provisions  a  non-EEA  national  wife  may
              achieve permanent  residence  when  the  EEA  national  ceases
              working, dies, or divorces her. In none of these cases is  the
              permanent right of  residence  dependent  on  residence  in  a
              common family home, and the period of  retained  residence  in
              the United Kingdom may in  certain  circumstances  be  shorter
              than three years.  Regulation 15(1)(f) refers to the  retained
              right of residence that is further provided for.

          22. In short if the IJ's construction of reg 15(1)(b)  is  correct
              it would result in anomalous and discriminatory  treatment  of
              the non-EEA national spouse who could not or would not  get  a
              divorce to terminate the marriage.

          23. There is no reason to believe that this is what  the  national
              legislator intended to achieve and  every  reason  to  believe
              that it would be a result intended to be avoided.

The Citizens Directive

          24.  Our  construction  of  the  Regulations  is   reinforced   by
              examination of the Community legislation they were designed to
              implement.


          25. Chapter III of the Citizens Directive provides for an  initial
              period  of  residence  of  three  months,  a  residence   card
              evidencing a right of residence for five  years  and  retained
              rights of residence.  Chapter IV then turns to  the  right  of
              permanent residence.


          26. Article 16 has the heading "General rule  for  Union  citizens
              and their family members".

          27. Article 16.1 provides "Union citizens who have resided legally
              for a continuous period of five years in the host Member State
              shall have the right of permanent residence there. This  right
              shall not be subject to the conditions provided for in chapter
              III."

          28. Article 16.2 continues "Paragraph 1 shall apply also to family
              members who are not nationals  of  a  Member  State  and  have
              resided with the Union citizen in the host Member State for  a
              continuous period of five years".

          29. The French text is in the following terms:

                  "2. Le paragraphe 1 s'applique �galement aux membres de la
                  famille qui n'ont pas la nationalit� d'un �tat  membre  et
             qui ont
                  s�journ� l�galement pendant une p�riode ininterrompue de
                  cinq ans avec le citoyen de  l'Union  dans  l'�tat  membre
             d'accueil."


          30. It is clear from the English and French text and the case of C-
              162/09 Secretary of State for Work and  Pensions  v  Lassal  7
              October  2010  at  [30]  that  this  new  right  of  permanent
              residence granted to Union citizens and their  family  members
              was an extension of rights granted under  previous  provisions
              of Community law.  It would  accordingly  seem  most  unlikely
              that a non-national spouse would have to  comply  with  a  new
              restrictive requirement of residence in the  household  of  an
              EEA national during the five years preceding  the  acquisition
              of the right of permanent residence that was not a requirement
              under the previous  law  as  exemplified  in  Diatta  and  the
              provisions of Articles 8 to 14 that need not be set out here.

          31. It is equally unlikely that Community law would distinguish so
              radically between the rights of  an  EEA  and  non-EEA  family
              member. Indeed Article 24 as well as recitals 17 and 20 in the
              Preamble to the Directive are indicators to the contrary:


                  "(17).... A right of permanent residence should  therefore
                  be laid down for  all  Union  citizens  and  their  family
                  members who have resided  in  the  host  Member  State  in
                  compliance with conditions laid  down  in  this  Directive
                  during a continuous period of five years..."


                  (20) In accordance with the prohibition of  discrimination
                  on grounds of nationality, all Union  citizens  and  their
                  family members residing in a Member State on the basis  of
                  this Directive should enjoy in  that  Member  State  equal
                  treatment with nationals..."

          32. Whilst it is possible to reach an  interpretation  of  Article
              16(2) that imposes a requirement on the non-EEA family  member
              to reside both with the EEA national  and  in  the  same  host
              state, strict linguistic construction is not the  correct  way
              to approach the interpretation of Community legislation.


          33. We have no doubt that in the light of its objects and  purpose
              Article  16(2)  is  intended  to  afford  all  family  members
              (irrespective of their nationality)  the  right  of  permanent
              residence after five years residence in the host  state  where
              the EEA national has resided. With this reading the  Directive
              adds  to  the  residence  rights  identified  in  Diatta   and
              applicable to all family members.

Conclusions

          34. We recognise that the fact  that  spouses  or  civil  partners
              decide not  to  live  together  in  a  common  household,  may
              sometimes invite inquiry into the nature of the relationship.


          35. No such inquiry could possibly arise in this case, where there
              has been genuine matrimonial cohabitation  for  some  time,  a
              child has been born to the couple  and  there  are  continuing
              social relations by the parties to the marriage in the context
              of contact with the child.


          36. The EEA Regulations (reg 2(1)) precludes those who  are  party
              to a marriage of convenience from being a spouse and therefore
              a family member under reg 7. As recital  28  of  the  Citizens
              Directive makes clear, a marriage of convenience is  an  abuse
              of rights but it is a term strictly limited  to  relationships
              "contracted for the sole purpose" of  enjoying  free  movement
              rights and with no effective social nexus between the parties.
              An inference of marriage of convenience  cannot  arise  solely
              because a married couple are not living in the same household.

          37. However, for the reasons we have given above, we conclude that
              reg 15(1)(b) applies to those who entered a  genuine  marriage
              where both parties have resided in the United Kingdom for five
              years since  the  marriage;  the  EEA  national's  spouse  has
              resided  as  the  family  member  of  a  qualified  person  or
              otherwise in accordance with the Regulations and the  marriage
              has not been dissolved.

          38. The appellant accordingly qualified for permanent residence on
              the facts found by the IJ  and  is  entitled  to  a  permanent
              residence card.

              This appeal is allowed.
