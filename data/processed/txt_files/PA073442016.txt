Solicitors.


                                  Anonymity

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  or  a
Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  original
appellant. I take the view that this is necessary in order  to  protect  the
identity of the original  appellant's  child.  This  direction  applies  to,
amongst others, all parties. Any  failure  to  comply  with  this  direction
could give rise to contempt of court proceedings. The parties at liberty  to
apply to discharge this order, with reasons





                            DECISION AND REASONS




Introduction and background facts:


 1. The issue in this case is whether  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Andonian (hereafter the "judge" unless otherwise indicated)  materially
    erred in law in concluding that the deportation of A S  (hereafter  the
    "claimant") would be in breach of  his  rights  under  Article  8.  The
    Secretary of State had made a deportation order against the claimant on
    4 July 2016 (served on 8 July 2016) in accordance with s.32(5)  of  the
    UK Borders Act 2007 (the "2007 Act"). The judge's decision  means  that
    he effectively concluded that Exception 1 as provided for in s.33(2) of
    the 2007 Act applied.

 2. Although not raised in the Secretary of State's grounds of  appeal  and
    not in issue before me, I should record that there appeared  to  be  no
    clear finding by the  judge  whether  the  claimant  had  rebutted  the
    presumptions in s.72 of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 (the "2002 Act"), although there were several  paragraphs  in  his
    decision concerning s.72 and he referred, at para 100, to the  claimant
    posing a low risk of re-offending in his consideration  of  Article  8.
    The parties were unable to point to any clear finding.

 3. However, the lack of any finding in relation to s.72 is  not  material,
    given the judge's adverse credibility assessment  in  relation  to  the
    claimant's asylum claim and the fact that he dismissed  the  claimant's
    appeal on asylum grounds.

 4. The claimant is a national of Afghanistan, born on 16 August  1990.  He
    has a daughter, Y, born on 18 February 2012, by his former partner,  Ms
    S P. In his concluding paragraph, the judge  said  that  he  considered
    that the  claimant's  claim  outweighed  the  public  interest  in  his
    deportation. He said that the claimant's deportation may well bring  to
    an end to the bond he has established with his daughter  and  that  his
    daughter "may well suffer psychologically, emotionally and mentally  as
    a result of the report of the independent  social  worker".  The  judge
    noted that the claimant is of low risk of offending and considered that
    "the claimant deserved this one last chance in the  best  interests  of
    his daughter to prove that he will remain out of trouble for all times.
    This was his first and only offence for which he has served time and  I
    hope he has learnt from it."

 5. The deportation order was made following the claimant's  conviction  at
    Birmingham Crown Court on 19 June 2012 of a money  laundering  offence,
    i.e. entering  into  an  arrangement  to  facilitate  the  acquisition,
    retention, use or control of criminal  property  by  or  on  behalf  of
    another person. On 19 December 2012,  he  was  sentenced  to  5  years'
    imprisonment.

 6. I set out at para 10 below, the relevant part of the sentencing remarks
    of the sentencing judge. It is sufficient to say at this point that the
    sentencing  judge  concluded  that  the   particular   money-laundering
    arrangement  that  the  claimant  (with  others)  participated  in  was
    "intricate,  highly  sophisticated  and  involved  numerous  layers  of
    personnel", that it operated for a significant period in  excess  of  2
    years and that the sums involved were "massive". The  sentencing  judge
    said that in total in excess of  �120  million  was  successfully  sent
    abroad, of which in excess of �60 million was banked  through  Barclays
    and NatWest in Birmingham. The sentencing judge said he  had  no  doubt
    that "all but a very  small  percentage  of  that  money  was  criminal
    property". In addition, he had no doubt that a  substantial  proportion
    of the money involved derived from the trafficking of both class A  and
    class B drugs.

 7. In relation to the claimant, the sentencing judge said the claimant had
    worked at the UK money exchange from the time it opened  in  June  2010
    until it effectively closed in March 2011 and that that  money  service
    business was set up for the sole purpose of creating false documents to
    disguise criminal money. The sentencing judge said  that  the  claimant
    had worked on a full-time basis  at  the  UK  money  exchange  and  was
    involved in creating  "literally  thousands  of  false  documents".  He
    concluded that the claimant was involved in this arrangement for  a  10
    month period and played a significant role.

Immigration history and factual background

 8. The claimant arrived in the United Kingdom on 7 October  2008  and  was
    served with illegal  entry  papers  on  22  October  2008  after  being
    encountered following which he claimed asylum. He  did  not  attend  an
    interview. On 24 February 2009, he was sent a letter which informed him
    that his asylum claim would be treated  as  withdrawn  if  he  did  not
    explain why he had not attended the interview. He did  not  respond  to
    the letter.  On  10  March  2009,  his  asylum  claim  was  treated  as
    withdrawn. At the same time, he was served with a notice (IS151A) which
    gave him a right of appeal. He did not appeal.

 9. The claimant was then convicted of the offence mentioned  above  on  19
    June 2012.  He was given prior  notice  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
    intention to deport him and  an  opportunity  to  make  representations
    before the deportation order was signed on 4 July 2016.

The sentencing judge's sentencing remarks

10. The relevant part of the sentencing judge's sentencing remarks read:


         "The particular money-laundering arrangement in which each of  you
         participated, involved a number of grave, aggravating features. It
         was intricate, highly sophisticated and involved  numerous  layers
         of personnel. Money was transported from criminal groups  to  cash
         couriers employed on behalf of the money- laundering group. It was
         then taken to a safe house for counting. The money was then  moved
         to a different premise where it was put  into  fast  deposit  bank
         bags in readiness for banking. False records were created by bogus
         money service businesses to disguise  the  origin  of  the  funds.
         There were four such bureaus, of which at least two  were  set  up
         with the  sole  intention  of  facilitating  the  money-laundering
         arrangement.


         The money was  banked  in  cash,  principally  in  Birmingham  and
         Manchester. It was then put into the account  of  the  Manchester-
         based money service business and rapidly transferred abroad. These
         activities were  controlled  from  abroad  principally  Dubai  and
         Pakistan Within the United Kingdom there were coordinators in day-
         to-day charge of the numerous transactions and layers of personnel
         to which  I  have  referred.  This  highly  organised  arrangement
         operated for a significant period in excess of two years. The sums
         involved were massive. In total in  excess  of  �120  million  was
         successfully sent abroad. Of that sum in excess of �60 million was
         banked through Barclays and NatWest in Birmingham. I have no doubt
         that all but a very small percentage of that  money  was  criminal
         property.


         In a general sense, the criminality of  money  laundering  is  the
         assistance, support and encouragement  that  it  provides  to  the
         underlying criminal conduct. In this case I have no doubt  that  a
         substantial proportion of the  money  involved  derived  from  the
         trafficking of both class A and class B drugs. The supply of drugs
         represents a social evil in which these courts are under a duty to
         deter.


         A S, you worked at the UK money exchange from the time  it  opened
         in June 2010 until it effectively closed in March 2011. That money
         service business was set up for the sole purpose of creating false
         documents to disguise criminal money. In that context  you  worked
         on a full-time basis at the UK money exchange and were involved in
         creating literally thousands of false documents. In the 10  months
         that it purported to these, it created false records in the sum of
         approximately �17 million. Those records were utilised within  the
         money-laundering arrangements to disguise a  corresponding  amount
         of criminal money.


         In addition, on two occasions in February and March 2011 you  were
         involved in collecting cash and taking it to the home of M  K.  It
         follows that you were involved in this arrangement for a 10  month
         role and played a significant role."

Relevant legal provisions

11. Section 117A-D of  the  2002  Act  provide  (insofar  as  relevant)  as
    follows:


        "117A Application of this Part
      (1)   This Part applies where a  court  or  tribunal  is  required  to
              determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-

        family life under Article 8, and
           (b)   as a result would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human
        Rights Act 1998.
      (2)   In considering  the  public  interest  question,  the  court  or
              tribunal must (in particular) have regard-

        117B, and
            (b)  in cases concerning the deportation of  foreign  criminals,
                   to the considerations listed in section 117C.
      (3)   In subsection (2), "the  public  interest  question"  means  the
              question of whether an interference with a person's right  to
              respect for  private  and  family  life  is  justified  under
              Article 8(2).

        criminals.
   (1)      The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.
      (2)   The more serious the offence committed by  a  foreign  criminal,
              the greater is the public  interest  in  deportation  of  the
              criminal.
      (3)   In the case of  a  foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
              sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or  more,
              the public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception
              1 or Exception 2 applies.
   (4)      Exception 1 applies where ...
       (5)  Exception 2  applies  where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
              relationship with a qualifying  partner,  or  a  genuine  and
              subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and
              the effect of C's deportation on the partner or  child  would
              be unduly harsh.
      (6)   In the case of a foreign criminal who has been  sentenced  to  a
              period of imprisonment of at least  four  years,  the  public
              interest  requires  deportation   unless   there   are   very
              compelling circumstances, over and above those  described  in
              Exceptions 1 and 2.

12. Paras 362, 397-399A of the Statement  of  Changes  in  the  Immigration
    Rules HC 395 (as amended) (hereafter the "Rules") provide  (insofar  as
    relevant) as follows:

   "A362. Where Article 8 is raised in the context of deportation under Part
        13 of these Rules, the claim under  Article  8  will  only  succeed
        where the requirements of these rules as at 28 July 2014  are  met,
        regardless of when  the  notice  of  intention  to  deport  or  the
        deportation order, as appropriate, was served.'
   ...
   397. A deportation order  will  not  be  made  if  the  person's  removal
        pursuant to the order would be contrary  to  the  UK's  obligations
        under the Refugee Convention or the Human Rights Convention.  Where
        deportation would not be contrary to  these  obligations,  it  will
        only be in exceptional circumstances that the  public  interest  in
        deportation is outweighed.


   A.398.  These rules apply where:


      (a)   a  foreign  criminal  liable  to  deportation  claims  that  his
              deportation  would  be  contrary  to  the  United   Kingdom's
              obligations under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention;
      (b)   a foreign criminal applies for a deportation order made  against
        him to be revoked.


        398.     Where a person claims  that  their  deportation  would  be
              contrary to the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the Human
              Rights Convention, and


            (a)  the deportation of the person from the UK is  conducive  to
                   the public good and in the public interest  because  they
                   have been convicted of an offence  for  which  they  have
                   been sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of  at  least
                   four years;
            (b)  the deportation of the person from the UK is  conducive  to
                   the public good and in the public interest  because  they
                   have been convicted of an offence  for  which  they  have
                   been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than 4
                   years but at least 12 months; or
            (c)  the deportation of the person from the UK is  conducive  to
                   the public good and in the public  interest  because,  in
                   the view of the Secretary of State, their  offending  has
                   caused serious harm or they are a persistent offender who
                   shows a particular disregard for the law,
            the Secretary of State in assessing  that  claim  will  consider
              whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if  it  does  not,
              the public interest in deportation will only be outweighed by
              other factors where there are very  compelling  circumstances
              over and above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.


   399.     This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies  if
        -
             (a)   the  person  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
                   relationship with a child under the age of 18  years  who
                   is in the UK and
            (i)   the child is a British citizen;  or
            (ii) the child has lived in the UK  continuously  for  at  least
                   the seven years immediately preceding  the  date  of  the
                   immigration decision;
            and in either case
                 (a)   it would be unduly harsh for the  child  to  live  in
                       the country to which the person is  to  be  deported;
                       and
                 (b)   it would be unduly harsh for the child to  remain  in
                       the UK without the person who is to be deported;
            or
            (b)  ...


      399A. ..."





The judge's decision

13. It is unnecessary to summarise the  judge's  reasons  for  his  adverse
    credibility assessment of the claimant's evidence concerning his asylum
    claim, given that this is not an issue before me.

14. In relation to the Article 8 claim, the evidence before the  judge  may
    be summarised as follows:

15. Following his release on licence, the claimant was given permission  in
    January 2016 by the probation service to move to London. Since then, he
    has lived with Ms P's mother who lives near Ms P. He and Ms P tried  to
    become a couple but eventually decided it was best for  their  daughter
    if their relationship was terminated and they became close friends  and
    parents to their daughter. He picks his daughter up  from  school  each
    day and takes her to her grandmother's house. He  spends  three  nights
    per week with Y who stays at her grandmother's home three days per week
    (para 26 of the judge's decision).

16. The claimant said that he was sure that he and  Ms  P  would  encourage
    their daughter to explore her Afghan culture and heritage but that Ms P
    could not teach Y about the Afghan background in the way that  he  said
    he could (para 28).

17. In evidence, Ms P said, inter alia, that although she would  support  Y
    to learn about Islam if the claimant  is  not  in  the  UK,  she  would
    struggle to teach her about Islam because she does not  believe  in  it
    herself. She is worried that without her  father  their  daughter  will
    lose all contact with her Afghan Islamic heritage (para 35).

18. In a report, an independent social worker outlined the strong bond  the
    claimant had with his daughter and the psychological damage that  there
    would be if her father is deported. His deportation  would  affect  her
    emotionally and educationally and  it  would  also  affect  her  social
    development. There may be implications  for  Y's  identity  needs.  The
    separation at  this  stage  in  their  relationship  is  likely  to  be
    perceived as a significant loss by Y (para 39).

19. The judge considered Article 8 at paras 95-100 of  his  decision.  They
    read:


        "95.     Article 8 (1) of the ECHR sets out that everybody has  the
             right to respect for his private  and  family  life.  However,
             every state has the right to control the entry of nonnationals
             [sic] into its territory and article 8 does not give a  person
             an automatic right to choose to pursue their private or family
             life in the UK. An interference with an  individual's  private
             or  family  life  will  only  be  unlawful  if  it  is   first
             established that private and family life exists and then  only
             if the interferences is for one or more of the public interest
             reasons  that  are  set  out  in  article  8  (2)  or  if  the
             interference  is  disproportionate  to  the  public   interest
             reasons.


        96.      The immigration rules at paragraph A 362 and  paragraph  A
             398 D set out the practice to be followed by officials  acting
             on behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State  when  considering  an
             article 8 claim from the person liable to deportation  on  the
             basis   of   criminal   convictions.   These   rules   reflect
             Parliament's view of what the public interest requires for the
             purpose of article 8 (2 ). Parliament's view is also  set  out
             in sections 117 A- to 117D in part  five  A  of  the  National
             Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 inserted  by  the  Immigration
             Act 2014.


        97.      The nature of the  [claimant's]  article  8  claim  is  as
             follows: - his established a family life and private  life  in
             the UK with his daughter [Y] date of birth 8th February  2012,
             a British citizen. In support of the  [claimant's]  article  8
             claim he has submitted  his  daughters  [sic]  full  UK  birth
             certificate.  He  is  he  father  on  the   certificate.   The
             [claimant's] former partner gave evidence as well as  did  the
             former partner's mother.


        98.      The [claimant's] deportation the SSHD said is conducive to
             the public good and in the public interest because he has been
             convicted of an offence for which he has been sentenced  to  a
             period of imprisonment for at least four years. Therefore,  in
             accordance with paragraph 398 of  the  immigration  rules  the
             public interest requires deportation  unless  there  are  very
             compelling circumstances over and above those described in the
             exceptions to deportation set out at paragraph 399 and  399  A
             of the immigration rules.


        99.      Insofar as very compelling circumstances are concerned, as
             the  exceptions  to  deportation  do   not   apply   to   him,
             considerations been given as to whether there  are  such  very
             compelling circumstances such that the [claimant]  should  not
             be deported. There is significant interest  in  deporting  the
             [claimant]. This is  because  he  was  convicted  for  a  very
             serious offence. As I  told  him  at  the  conclusion  of  the
             hearing when reserving my decision,  just  because  he  has  a
             daughter who is a British citizen, that is not a  trump  card.
             In order to outweigh the very significant public  interest  in
             deporting the [claimant], he will need to provide evidence  of
             a very strong article 8 claim over and above the circumstances
             described  in  the  exceptions  to  deportation.  [Y]  is  the
             [claimant's] daughter. She was born on 18 February 2012 to [Ms
             P]. She is now at the date of the hearing  before  me  over  5
             years of age. I have seen her a copy of her birth certificate.
             I accept that the [claimant] is the father  of  the  child.  I
             accept  that  he  sees  his  daughter  on  a   regular   basis
             practically daily. I accept he takes her to and  from  school,
             sees her practically daily, cooks and cleans  for  her,  takes
             her to the park, bathes her and puts her to bed, and helps her
             in her lessons. I accept that there is a strong  bond  between
             her and her father. I accept the  conclusions  of  the  social
             worker. I accept the importance of the support that the girl's
             mother and grandmother said that the [claimant] gives  to  her
             as her father.  I  considered  both  the  [claimant's]  former
             partner and  the  child's  grandmother  as  entirely  credible
             witnesses in regard to the bond that has developed between the
             [claimant] and his child.


        100.     The  Home  Office's  duty  to  safeguard  the  welfare  of
             children is set out in section 55 of the Boarders  Citizenship
             and Immigration Act 2009 and this has been taken into  account
             by me in the best interests of the child as  being  a  primary
             consideration. However, the best interests of  the  child  are
             not the only or paramount consideration and must  be  balanced
             against other relevant factors including the  public  interest
             in deporting foreign criminals and to  determine  whether  the
             [claimant's] deportation is proportionate. I take note of  the
             social workers opinion. Taking all matters  in  the  round,  I
             also note the [claimant] is remorseful and that he knows  what
             he had done was wrong and that is why he pleased guilty at the
             first day of the trial. I  believe  for  the  reasons  already
             stated as regards this article 8 claim that in this case it is
             considered sufficient enough to outweigh the  public  interest
             in his deportation. I understand and believe if the [claimant]
             was deported this may well bring an end  to  the  relationship
             and the bond he has now established with his daughter and  she
             may well suffer psychologically, emotionally and mentally as a
             result of the report of the independent social worker. I  also
             note that the [claimant] is of low risk of offending from  all
             the independent reports I have considered  and  deserves  this
             one last chance in the best interests of his daughter to prove
             that he will remain out of trouble for all times. This was his
             first and only offence for which he has served time and I hope
             he has learnt from it."


        (My emphasis)

The grounds and issues before me

20. The grounds may be summarised as follows: In allowing the appeal on the
    basis that the claimant deserves "this one  last  chance  in  the  best
    interests of his daughter to prove that he will remain out  of  trouble
    for all times", the judge had erred  by  importing  his  own  test  and
    failing to apply the mandatory requirements of s.117A-D which  required
    the claimant to show very compelling circumstances over and above those
    described in paras 399 of the Rules, as affirmed by the  Supreme  Court
    in Ali v SSHD [2016] UKSC 60. The claimant's daughter had no medical or
    special needs. The claimant's involvement in her daily routine, such as
    taking her to and from school, cooking and cleaning for her, and taking
    her to the park was no different from that undertaken by many  parents.
    The  consequence  of  contact  being  lost  cannot  be   described   as
    inordinately  or  excessively  severe  or  bleak  for  the   claimant's
    daughter, let alone constitute very  compelling  circumstances.  In  CT
    (Vietnam) [2016] EWCA Civ 488, the Court of Appeal held that  only  the
    strongest  Article  8  claim  will  outweigh  the  public  interest  in
    deporting someone who had  been  sentenced  to  at  least  four  years'
    imprisonment.

21. At the commencement of the hearing, I asked the parties to  address  me
    on the following issues:

    (i)     whether, in light of the guidance in relevant judgments of  the
        Court of  Appeal  and  Supreme  Court,  the  judge  was  reasonably
        entitled to allow the appeal on the facts as found by him.

    (ii)    whether he had effectively treated  Y's  best  interests  as  a
        "trump card" notwithstanding that he said they were not so.

Submissions

22. Mr Melvin relied upon the grounds.  He  also  relied  upon  SSHD  v  AJ
    (Zimbabwe) and other [2016] EWCA Civ 1012  and  NA  (Pakistan)  v  SSHD
    [2016] EWCA Civ 662.

23. In relation to the grounds, Mr Melvin  submitted  that  the  judge  had
    failed to apply Ali. Y had no  medical  or  other  special  needs.  The
    claimant's  involvement  in  Y's  life  was   no   different   to   the
    circumstances  of  many  other  parents.  There  were   no   compelling
    circumstances, let alone very compelling circumstances over  and  above
    those described in paras 399 of the Rules.

24. Mr Melvin submitted that, in light of para 33  of  AJ  (Zimbabwe),  the
    judge was not reasonably entitled to allow the appeal on the  facts  of
    the case. Furthermore, he effectively treated the Y's best interests as
    the paramount consideration. The separation of a  child  and  a  parent
    cannot, without more, constitute very compelling circumstances, as  the
    Court of Appeal said in AJ (Zimbabwe) at para 31. At para 46, the Court
    of Appeal said that emotional damage experienced  by  a  child  due  to
    being separated from a parent is  not  unusual.  Any  other  conclusion
    would drain para 398 of the Rules of any practical significance.

25. Mr Melvin submitted that the  judge  had  reached  an  unreasonable  or
    irrational conclusion. He asked me to set aside the judge's decision to
    allow the appeal under Article 8 and to proceed to dismiss the  appeal,
    on the basis that no reasonable judge could allow  the  appeal  on  the
    facts of the case. In this regard, he relied upon paras 31, 33  and  46
    of AJ (Zimbabwe).

26. Ms Bexson submitted that the judge was reasonably entitled to allow the
    appeal and that he did not treat Y's  best  interests  as  the  primary
    consideration.

27. Ms Bexson submitted that the  Secretary  of  State's  grounds  were  an
    attempt to re-argue the case. It is clear  from  paras  95-100  of  his
    decision that the judge did not  ignore  the  mandatory  provisions  of
    s.117A-D. It is plain that he considered the  statutory  framework.  At
    para  98,  he  said  that  the  public  interest  requires  a  person's
    deportation unless there were very compelling  circumstances  over  and
    above those described in paras 399 and 399A. He considered this against
    the factual  matrix  of  the  case.  He  gave  clear  reasons  why  the
    daughter's circumstances went beyond the norm. He had a report from  an
    independent  social  worker  who  said  that  the  child  would  suffer
    emotional and psychological  damage.  He  weighed  these  circumstances
    against the state's interests. He noted that the claimant posed a  risk
    of re-offending and that he had shown remorse. He had pleaded guilty on
    the first day of  his  trial.  The  claimant's  daughter  is  of  mixed
    ethnicity. The response of Ms P in evidence, as to  whether  she  would
    support her day learning about Islam was very qualified (para 35 of the
    judge's  decision).  Ms  Bexson  submitted  that  the  judge  did   not
    substitute his own test, as contended in the grounds. He  decided  that
    the impact  on  Y  of  the  claimant's  deportation  amounted  to  very
    compelling circumstances over and above those described  in  paras  399
    and 399A.

28. I asked Ms Bexson to address me on Mr Melvin's submission that, if  the
    judge's decision is set aside, I should proceed to re-make the decision
    on the appeal and dismiss it without hearing any further evidence.

29. Ms Bexson submitted that the appeal should be remitted  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal ("FtT") because the claimant may obtain a further  report
    from a social worker. This would be necessary in order  to  update  the
    Tribunal on Y's emotional state.

30. I asked Ms Bexson to explain  what  circumstances  existed  to  justify
    further evidence being given. She submitted  that  the  claimant  would
    prefer to give further evidence and therefore she  requested  that  the
    appeal be remitted to the FtT or, in the alternative, that  the  appeal
    be re-made in the Upper Tribunal.

31. I reserved my decision.

Assessment

32. The relevant legal provisions, which I have set out  above,  have  been
    considered by the higher courts on  a  number  of  occasions,  examples
    being the Supreme Court's judgment in Ali and  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    judgments in AJ (Zimbabwe) and NA  (Pakistan),  upon  which  Mr  Melvin
    relied, as well as the more recent judgment of the Court of  Appeal  in
    SSHD v OP (Jamaica) [2018] EWCA Civ 316.

33. The principles to be drawn from the jurisprudence are not  in  dispute.
    At para 14 of NA (Pakistan), the Court of Appeal said  that  the  legal
    provisions divide foreign criminals into  two  categories:  those  with
    sentences of  between  one  and  four  years'  imprisonment  and  those
    sentenced to four years or more. For convenience, I  shall  follow  the
    terminology used in NA (Pakistan)  (para  14)  to  describe  the  first
    category as 'medium offenders' and  the  second  category  as  'serious
    offenders'.

34. Medium offenders can escape deportation if they come  within  paragraph
    399 ('parent/partner provisions') or paragraph  399A  ('long  residence
    provisions') (the "safety nets".  If a medium offender  does  not  come
    within either of the safety nets, he can  only  escape  deportation  on
    Article 8  grounds  "in  exceptional  circumstances"  (para  15  of  NA
    (Pakistan), now amended so that it is necessary to show very compelling
    circumstances over and above those described in paras 399 and 399A.

35. Serious offenders can not escape  deportation  by  bringing  themselves
    within either, or indeed both, of the safety nets.  The  last  part  of
    rule 398 provided that a serious offender could only escape deportation
    on Article 8 grounds "in exceptional  circumstances",  now  amended  so
    that it is necessary to show very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
    above those described in paras 399 and 399A.

36. At paras 29, 30, 33 and 34 of NA (Pakistan), the Court of Appeal said:


        "29.     In our view, the reasoning of the Court of  Appeal  in  JZ
             (Zambia) applies to  those  provisions.   The  phrase  used  in
             section 117C(6), in para. 398 of the 2014 rules  and  which  we
             have held is to be read into section 117C(3) does not mean that
             a foreign criminal facing deportation is altogether disentitled
             from seeking to rely on matters falling within the scope of the
             circumstances described in Exceptions 1 and 2 when  seeking  to
             contend that "there are very compelling circumstances, over and
             above those described in Exceptions  1  and  2".   As  we  have
             indicated above, a foreign criminal is entitled  to  rely  upon
             such matters, but he would need to be able to point to features
             of his case of a kind mentioned in Exceptions 1 and 2  (and  in
             paras. 399 or 399A of the  2014  rules),  or  features  falling
             outside the circumstances described  in  those  Exceptions  and
             those paragraphs, which made  his  claim  based  on  Article  8
             especially strong.


        30.      In the case of a  serious  offender  who  could  point  to
             circumstances in his own case which could be said to correspond
             to the circumstances described in Exceptions 1 and 2, but where
             he could only just succeed in such an argument, it would not be
             possible to describe his situation as involving very compelling
             circumstances, over and above those described in  Exceptions  1
             and 2. One might describe that as  a  bare  case  of  the  kind
             described in Exceptions 1 or 2. On the other hand, if he  could
             point to factors identified in the descriptions of Exceptions 1
             and 2 of an especially compelling kind in support of an Article
             8 claim, going well beyond what would be necessary to make  out
             a bare case of the kind described in Exceptions 1 and  2,  they
             could in principle constitute "very  compelling  circumstances,
             over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2",  whether
             taken by  themselves  or  in  conjunction  with  other  factors
             relevant to application of Article 8.


        33.      Although there  is  no  'exceptionality'  requirement,  it
             inexorably follows from the statutory scheme that the cases  in
             which circumstances are sufficiently compelling to outweigh the
             high  public  interest  in  deportation  will  be  rare.    The
             commonplace incidents of family life, such as ageing parents in
             poor health or the natural love between parents  and  children,
             will not be sufficient.


        34.      The best  interests  of  children  certainly  carry  great
             weight, as identified by Lord Kerr in HH v Deputy Prosecutor of
             the Italian Republic [2012] UKSC 25; [2013] 1 AC 338 at  [145].
             Nevertheless, it is a  consequence  of  criminal  conduct  that
             offenders may be separated from their children for many  years,
             contrary  to  the  best  interests  of  those  children.    The
             desirability  of  children  being  with  both  parents   is   a
             commonplace of family life.  That is not usually a sufficiently
             compelling circumstance to outweigh the high public interest in
             deporting  foreign  criminals.   As  Rafferty  LJ  observed  in
             Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  v  CT  (Vietnam)
             [2016] EWCA Civ 488 at [38]:


                 "Neither  the  British  nationality  of  the  respondent's
                 children nor their likely separation from their father  for
                 a long time are exceptional  circumstances  which  outweigh
                 the public interest in his deportation."

37. It is therefore clear that an especially strong case is required before
    an Article 8 claim can  succeed  on  the  basis  that  there  are  very
    compelling circumstances over and above those described  in  paras  399
    and 399A.

38. Turning now to instant case, the claimant was  sentenced  to  5  years'
    imprisonment. This means that he is a serious offender who  could  only
    succeed in his Article 8 claim on the basis of  his  relationship  with
    his daughter if there were very compelling circumstances.

39. It is  clear  that  the  judge  referred  in  terms  to  the  mandatory
    provisions of s.117A-D and that  he  also  referred  in  terms  to  the
    requirement for the claimant to show that there  were  very  compelling
    circumstances over and above those described in paras 399. Further,  it
    is also clear that he said in terms that the best interests of a  child
    are not a trump card and  that  the  claimant  will  need  to  "provide
    evidence of a very  strong  claim  over  and  above  the  circumstances
    described in the exceptions to deportation".

40. The question in this case is whether the judge did in  fact  apply  the
    principles he correctly set out.

41. I have concluded that he did not. The circumstances of  the  claimant's
    case cannot,  any  reasonable  view,  be  described  as  sufficient  to
    constitute even a bare case falling within para 399, let alone one that
    constitutes  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and   above   those
    described in paras 399. Y has no medical needs or other special  needs.
    Whilst it is correct that  the  social  worker's  report  explains  the
    emotional and psychological damage  that  Y  would  suffer  if  she  is
    separated from her father, this is not exceptional or unusual. It is to
    be expected that deportation will separate children from their  parents
    and that the children will suffer distress. The claimant's  involvement
    in her daily life is not unusual.

42. Insofar as reliance was placed on the fact that Y is a mixed child  who
    would lose the opportunity to learn about Islam and her Afghan heritage
    from the claimant if he is deported, I cannot  see  that  this  can  be
    described as an unusual circumstance. There are very many children  who
    are of mixed heritage. Even if it  is  the  case  that  she  loses  the
    opportunity to learn about Islam and her Afghan heritage,  this  cannot
    reasonably constitute a very compelling circumstance.

43. I have therefore concluded that the judge could only have  reached  the
    decision he reached by impermissibly placing little or no weight on the
    state's interests and by treating Y's best interests as  the  paramount
    consideration contrary to his express self-direction on more  than  one
    occasion that they were not a trump card. He could  only  have  reached
    the conclusion he reached by paying lip service to  the  principles  he
    had to apply notwithstanding that he set them out.

44. The mere fact that a judge says he has applied  a  principle  does  not
    mean that he did in fact do so if the facts are such that  the  judge's
    conclusion  is  unreasonable  when  tested  against  the  principle  in
    question. I am in no doubt that that is the case here.

45. It is not the case, as the judge  appeared  to  think,  that  the  only
    applicable facet of the public interest was the risk  of  re-offending.
    There are other, important, facets including the public  interest  that
    those who are serious offenders should be  deported  in  all  but  rare
    cases. Money laundering offences are  very  serious  offences.  In  the
    instant case, the sentencing judge had  no  doubt  that  a  substantial
    proportion of the  money  that  was  laundered  was  derived  from  the
    trafficking of class  A  and  class  B  offences.   Those  who  involve
    themselves in trafficking drugs depend upon  people  to  launder  their
    money. The sentence of 5 years' imprisonment is a proper measure of the
    seriousness of the claimant's offence. The necessity for  the  claimant
    to show very compelling circumstances over and above those described in
    paras 399 sets the threshold at the appropriate level  to  take  proper
    account of all the facets of the public interest  that  must  be  taken
    into account.

46. I agree with Mr Melvin that a decision which sets the threshold for the
    requirement to show very compelling circumstances so low that the  best
    interests of a child who has no medical and no special needs and  where
    the only notable features were that she will lose  the  opportunity  to
    learn about Islam and her  Afghan  culture  in  addition  to  suffering
    psychological damage outweighed the public interest  would  effectively
    drain para 398 of the Rules of any practical significance.

47. I have therefore concluded that the judge materially erred  in  law  in
    allowing the appeal as follows: Although he referred in  terms  to  the
    need  for  the  claimant  to  show  that  there  were  very  compelling
    circumstances over and above those described in paras 399, he  did  not
    in fact apply the test. Although he said that the best interests  of  a
    child are not a trump card, he proceeded to treat Y's best interests as
    of paramount consideration.

48. In addition, and for the same reasons,  I  am  in  no  doubt  that  the
    judge's conclusion, that there were very compelling circumstances  over
    and above those described in paras 399, was  unreasonable.  This  is  a
    further material error of law.

49. I therefore set aside the judge's  decision  to  allow  the  claimant's
    appeal under Article 8.

50. In re-making the  decision,  I  have  to  consider  first  whether  the
    claimant should be allowed to give further evidence.

51. I asked Ms Bexson to explain why the Tribunal  should  receive  further
    evidence if I reach  the  conclusion  that  the  judge's  decision  was
    unreasonable.  She said that the claimant may obtain a  further  report
    from a social worker in order to update the Tribunal on  Y's  emotional
    state and that the claimant would like to give  further  evidence.  She
    did not say that there had been any change in circumstances such as  to
    lead me to think that there  might  potentially  now  be  in  existence
    evidence of  circumstances  capable  of  constituting  very  compelling
    circumstances.

52. Given that the judge's findings of fact and assessment of the impact on
    Y of the claimant being deported have  not  been  disputed,  I  see  no
    reason to hear further evidence.

53. Importantly, in my view, the fact is  that  the  circumstances  of  the
    instant   case   cannot   reasonably   constitute    very    compelling
    circumstances. For the reasons given above, on any legitimate view,  no
    reasonable judge could conclude that the circumstances in  the  instant
    case taken as a whole amount to very compelling circumstances over  and
    above those described in paras 399.

54. Accordingly, I have decided  that  there  is  no  need  for  the  Upper
    Tribunal to hear further evidence. I proceed to re-make the decision on
    the claimant's appeal and dismiss his appeal on  human  rights  grounds
    against the Secretary of State's decision. My reasons are given above.

      Decision


    The decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Andonian involved  the
    making of a material error of law.

      I set aside the decision to allow the  appeal  under  Article  8.  His
    decision  to  dismiss  the  appeal  on  asylum  grounds,   humanitarian
    protection grounds and in relation to Article 3 stands.

      I re-make the decision on the Article 8 claim by dismissing it.
