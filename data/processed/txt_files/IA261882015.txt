& Jones, solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Tony Melvin, a senior home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who  appeals  with  permission
    against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal refusing him  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom on private and family life grounds.

 2. The appellant came to the United Kingdom as Tier  4  a  student  on  25
    October 2009 and was in the United Kingdom with  leave  on  that  basis
    until 28 June 2014.  During that time he  met  and  married  his  wife.
    Thereafter, he had no leave and was here unlawfully.





Refusal letter

 3. In her  refusal  letter,  the  respondent  considered  the  appellant's
    circumstances under the partner and  private  life  routes,  concluding
    that he could not meet the requirements of the Rules  in  either  case.
    The appellant had been in the United Kingdom  precariously  (i.e.  with
    leave) from October 2009 to 28  June  2014,  but  thereafter  had  been
    unsuccessful in obtaining further leave. All of the time spent  in  the
    United Kingdom was either precarious or unlawful, and in total, at  the
    date of decision, the appellant had been in the United Kingdom for less
    than 6 years.

 4. When considering the partner  route,  the  respondent  noted  that  the
    appellant and his British citizen wife  have  no  children.   Paragraph
    EX.1 does not apply and the respondent considered that EX.2 was not met
    because no insurmountable obstacles had been shown  for  the  appellant
    and his wife to relocate to Bangladesh, where they both were born,  and
    he still had a large extended family.

 5. When considering private life, the respondent noted that at the date of
    application, the appellant had been in the United Kingdom for less than
    6 years, not the 20 years which the Rules require, and did  not  accept
    that he had lost his social and cultural ties to  Bangladesh,  or  that
    there  were  very  significant  obstacles  to  his   integration   into
    Bangladesh if he returned there.

 6. The respondent also  considered  whether  there  were  any  exceptional
    circumstances for the grant of leave to remain outside the  Rules,  and
    in particular, his family life with his partner, but  noted  that  when
    entering the United Kingdom to study, the  appellant  would  have  been
    aware that his leave to  remain  was  temporary  and  not  a  route  to
    settlement.

First-tier Tribunal decision

 7. The First-tier Judge found  that  although  the  appellant's  wife  was
    pregnant at the date of the hearing and asserted that she had diabetes,
    there being no medical evidence to support that, the parties could  not
    bring themselves within the family life provisions of the  Rules.   The
    judge accepted at [22] that the relationship was genuine and subsisting
    and that paragraph EX.1 should  be  applied,  but  he  found  that  the
    parties could not bring themselves within EX.1 because  there  were  no
    insurmountable obstacles to their return to Bangladesh,  both  of  them
    being Bangladesh born and the appellant still  having  his  mother  and
    seven sisters in Bangladesh, whom his wife had met  during  a  two-week
    visit in November 2015.

 8. As regards compassionate circumstances, the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    found that there were no exceptional  compassionate  circumstances  for
    which leave to remain should be given outside the Rules.

Permission to appeal

 9. The appellant's challenge to the decision  was  on  Chikwamba  grounds,
    that the appellant would be returning to Bangladesh only  in  order  to
    secure entry clearance; that the judge applied too high a  standard  of
    proof (which cannot be traced to any observation in  the  determination
    at  all);  and  by  way  of  a  disagreement  with  the   findings   on
    insurmountable     obstacles,     exceptional     circumstances     and
    proportionality.

10. The grounds concluded that the determination "is so  perverse  that  no
    other Immigration Judge would have made the same finding  and  decision
    as it has been made in this case".

11. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier  Judge  Osborne  on  the
    basis that she considered  it  arguable  that  the  standard  of  proof
    adopted was too high and on the basis  of  various  observations  about
    117B(5), which are not as it turns out relevant to  the  assessment  of
    this decision and the materiality of the errors therein made.

Rule 24 Reply

12. There respondent filed a Rule 24 Reply on  24  August  2017,  asserting
    that the judge's assessment under EX.1 was correct,  that  the  correct
    test was applied to insurmountable obstacles, that applying R  (on  the
    application of Chen) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    (Appendix FM - Chikwamba - temporary  separation -  proportionality)
    (IJR) [2015] UKUT 00189, return to Bangladesh to make  the  application
    for readmission would not be unreasonable  and,  finally,  there  is  a
    submission about Section 117B with which I am not  concerned  for  the
    purposes of this decision.

Discussion

13. The provisions of section 117B, so far as relevant, are as follows:

         "(4)   Little weight should be given to-
             (a)  a private life, or
             (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
         that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
         United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5)  Little weight should be given to a private life established by
         a person  at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration  status  is
         precarious.

         (6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-
             (a)   the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and
             (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
             the United Kingdom."

14. The First-tier Tribunal Judge directed himself correctly at  [31]  that
    the appellant had entered the United Kingdom on a precarious basis  and
    that little weight could be given to his private life developed  during
    that period. However, at the end  of  that  paragraph,  he  erroneously
    directed himself that the appellant entered as a visitor.  At  the  end
    of [33], he noted that 'the whole of the appellant's time spent in  the
    United Kingdom is in the knowledge that they have no  right  to  settle
    here'. That latter statement is factually correct.

15. The statutory presumptions in section 117B(4)(b) applies to family life
    with a qualifying partner, if that family life is  established  when  a
    person is unlawfully in the United Kingdom, which was not  the  factual
    situation here: the appellant met and married his wife during his  Tier
    4 (student) migrant leave  period.   Accordingly,  the  Judge  was  not
    required to give little weight to the appellant's family life,  but  of
    course, he was required to consider the Immigration  Rules  themselves,
    which  the  appellant  could  not  meet,  because  he  could  not  show
    insurmountable obstacles to return to the country of  origin  with  his
    wife.  Section 117B(5) relates only to private life and the  Judge  was
    therefore required to give little weight  to  the  appellant's  private
    life developed in the short period he has lived here.  Section  117B(6)
    is not operative, as the appellant has no children here.

16.      The First-tier Tribunal decision could have been  better  written.
    It contains two misstatements of fact: at  [31],  the  Judge  began  by
    stating that the appellant entered the United Kingdom as a student, but
    ended the paragraph by saying that the appellant  came  to  the  United
    Kingdom as a visitor; but in either case, he entered the United Kingdom
    precariously and it is not disputed that he remained without leave when
    his student visas expired in 2014, following his marriage.

17.      At [12], the Judge  suggested  that  he  had  heard  4  witnesses,
    whereas he heard evidence from the appellant and his wife, and no other
    witnesses. However, in the body of the determination those are the only
    two witnesses whose evidence is recited or relied upon.  There  are  no
    phantom  witnesses,  and  again,  this  seems  to  be  a  question   of
    carelessness rather than misdirection of  fact.  I  am  satisfied  that
    neither of these factual errors was operative in the decision  made  by
    the Tribunal and that they are immaterial to the outcome of the  appeal
    (see  R (Iran) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA
    Civ 982 and AS (Iran) v The Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2017] EWCA Civ 1539 at [26]).

18. The Chikwamba argument cannot succeed on the facts of this appeal:  the
    sponsor's income at �1400-�1500 per month  (�16,800-�18000  per  annum)
    was below  the  �18600  level  required  for  entry  clearance  of  the
    appellant as her spouse, assuming he met the other requirements of  the
    Rules.  Further, I was told at the hearing that  the  appellant's  wife
    has now given up work because of her pregnancy.  Whether considered  at
    the date of hearing or the date of the Upper Tribunal hearing  (or  any
    earlier relevant date) it is not the case that the appellant  would  be
    leaving  the  United  Kingdom  with  the  certainty  of  a   successful
    application for readmission as his wife's spouse and Chikwamba does not
    apply.

19. Nor is there any sign within the decision  that  the  Judge  applied  a
    standard of proof higher than balance of probabilities in reaching  his
    conclusions: indeed, save for the factual errors identified above,  the
    Judge's conclusions of fact are undisputed.   On  the  evidence  before
    him, which consisted of the oral evidence of the husband and his  wife,
    no supporting medical evidence regarding the  wife's  diabetes  or  the
    availability of medical treatment and so forth in Bangladesh,  and  the
    exceptional circumstances advanced being just the wife's  diabetes  and
    her pregnancy, neither of which is particularly exceptional, the  judge
    was unarguably entitled to  reach  the  conclusion  that  he  did  that
    removal  of  this  appellant  to  Bangladesh  would   be   lawful   and
    proportionate.



DECISION

20. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error  on
    a point of law. I do not set aside the decision but order that it shall
    stand.
