Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J. Gajjar, Counsel (Direct Access)
For the Respondent:    Mr T. Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DECISION AND REASONS (V)

This has been a remote hearing  which  has  not  been  objected  to  by  the
parties.  The form of remote hearing was V (video). A face to  face  hearing
was not held because  it  was  not  practicable  and  all  issues  could  be
determined in a remote hearing.

The documents that I was referred  to  are  in  the  appellant's  First-tier
Tribunal  bundle  of  132  pages,  the  grounds  of  appeal,  the  grant  of
permission to appeal, written submissions from Mr Gajjar and Mr  C.  Howells
on behalf of the appellant and respondent respectively, each dated 20  April
2020, the contents of which I have recorded.

The order made is described at the end of these reasons.

The parties said this about the process: they were content that it had  been
conducted fairly in its remote form.

 1. The appellants are a  married  couple,  Mr  Naqvi  Masoom  ("the  first
    appellant") and Mrs Sana Masom  ("the  second  appellant").   They  are
    citizens of Pakistan born on 1 September  1979  and  on  28  July  1983
    respectively.

 2. They appeal against a decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Anthony
    promulgated on 28 August 2019 dismissing their appeals against separate
    decisions of the respondent to refuse their human  rights  claims.  The
    decisions of the respondent were dated 1 April  2019  and  2  May  2019
    respectively.

 3. On 7 April 2020, the President of the Upper Tribunal issued  directions
    which stated that it was his preliminary view  that  the  questions  of
    whether the decision of the First-Tier Tribunal involved the making  of
    an error of law and, if so, whether it should be set  aside,  could  be
    determined on the  papers.  Both  parties  responded  with  submissions
    addressing those questions. On 30 July 2020, Judge Smith directed  that
    an oral hearing would be required, inviting submissions as to whether a
    remote hearing would be possible. Neither party objected  to  a  remote
    hearing. It follows, therefore, that the hearing before me  took  place
    on a remote basis, but with the additional benefit of detailed  written
    submissions which had been prepared to cover  the  eventuality  that  a
    paper determination may have taken place. I am grateful to the  parties
    for their clear and helpful written submissions, and I am also grateful
    for the clarity and quality  of  the  oral  argument  that  the  remote
    hearing before me on 7 October 2020.

Factual background

 4. The first appellant entered the United Kingdom in  October  2006  as  a
    student.  He was joined by his wife on 25 June 2014 as  his  dependent.
    The first appellant's leave was renewed in the Tier 1  general  migrant
    category until 29 November 2015. Shortly before the expiration of  that
    leave, he applied for indefinite leave  to  remain  under  the  Tier  1
    route, and subsequently varied his application to indefinite  leave  to
    remain on the basis of his long residence.

 5. In a Tier 1 (General) application submitted on  11  October  2010,  the
    first appellant claimed net profit trading as M. R. Business associates
    of �55,906, and during the period 1 January 2010 to 5 October 2010.  On
    5 November 2012, the first appellant claimed  a  profit  of  �38,096.38
    during the period 1 November 2011 to 7  October  2012,  from  the  same
    business.  For the tax years covering the same periods,  the  appellant
    declared the following income for tax purposes:



    |            |Self-employed        |Self-employed net  |
|            |turnover             |profit             |
|2010/2011   |�4,226.00            |�3,552.00          |
|2011/2012   |�2,600.00            |�2,018.00          |
|2012/2013   |�1,440.00            |�-468.00           |
|2013/2014   |�0.00                |�0.00              |


    Note that  the  first  appellant's  chosen  accounting  years  did  not
    correspond  directly  to  the  tax  years.   Nothing  turns   on   that
    distinction for present purposes.

 6. The first appellant was invited to a credibility interview where he was
    asked to explain the  discrepancies.  He  explained  that  his  company
    provided "generic  services  all  related  to  business  and  finance",
    stating  that  his  qualifications  included  his  degree  in  business
    economics, finance and banking, as well as the experience he had gained
    from providing online services to  clients.  See  question  21  of  the
    interview conducted on 26 May 2016.   At  question  48,  the  applicant
    explained that he had, to date, paid a total of �500 in tax  from  2009
    onwards. He said that roughly �32,000 was due, but that he would  defer
    the payment.  He used to rely on an  accountant  called  Mr  Patel  who
    operated from Luton (when asked for the address, the  appellant  simply
    stated Luton). He accepted that Mr Patel was not a qualified accountant
    but  that  he  provided  bookkeeping  services.  By  the  time  of  the
    interview, he had a new accountant, a Mr Ikam at Rizvi & Co.

 7. The respondent considered that it  was  not  credible  that  the  first
    appellant did not understand the basic taxation obligations to which he
    was subject; he had paid only �500 in tax on self-employed income since
    2009, but claimed to have  had  a  combined  profit  of  in  excess  of
    �132,000 over the same period. This, concluded  the  respondent,  meant
    the first appellant had either misrepresented his earnings to  HMRC  in
    order to reduce his tax liability, or had  provided  false  information
    about his earnings in order to obtain leave to remain, or the appellant
    had engaged in a combination of the two.

 8. That, concluded the Secretary of State, meant there were  discretionary
    grounds for refusing the application on suitability  grounds,  pursuant
    to paragraph 276B(ii) and paragraph 322(5) of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    There were no reasons, considered the Secretary of State,  to  exercise
    discretion in his favour.

 9. The second appellant's application was considered  separately,  on  its
    own merits. She was found not to meet any  eligibility  criteria  under
    the rules, and there were  no  exceptional  circumstances  outside  the
    rules such that it would be unjustifiably harsh to expect her to  leave
    the United Kingdom.

10. The appellants have a daughter and a son, born in March 2015 and  March
    2017 respectively.  They are now aged five and three.  Neither child is
    a British citizen.

11. In her decision dismissing  the  appellant's  appeals,  the  judge  was
    concerned that there had been no documentary  evidence  to  verify  the
    existence of Mr Patel, or his accounting firm: [17],  [18].  The  judge
    found the appellant's explanations for  the  significant  discrepancies
    "vague and wholly unpersuasive". The first appellant had explained that
    Mr Patel had advised him that it was possible to  deduct  as  allowable
    expenses expenditure which was, in fact, disallowable.  The  judge  was
    concerned that the appellant had not been  clearer  about  the  way  in
    which the error came about, especially in  view  of  the  fact  he  was
    "running a business providing bookkeeping  and  accountancy  services",
    and that the  appellant  would  be  likely  to  possess  the  necessary
    expertise to discern the difference between allowable and  disallowable
    expenses. "Quite how Mr Patel was able to pull the wool over  his  eyes
    is wholly unclear" [19].

12. The judge highlighted the fact the appellant had relied on a  different
    firm of accountants, AWS, to prepare his  applications  under  Tier  1.
    That firm was  not  mentioned  in  the  appellant's  witness  statement
    prepared for the appeal.

13. Other explanations provided by the appellant when credible, for example
    his claim that he did not understand that the possibility was  open  to
    him of declaring taxable income in a manner  which  correlated  to  his
    accounting year, rather than to the tax year. The first  appellant  had
    claimed that the fact that his accounting years  (and  the  figures  he
    provided in support of his Tier 1 application) did not  correlate  with
    tax years had been the cause of  some  confusion.  The  judge  did  not
    accept this explanation.

14. Given the appellant was running "a business providing  bookkeeping  and
    accountancy services", the judge found it "wholly incredible" that  the
    appellant did not question Mr Patel's  calculations  which  arrived  at
    "polar opposite figures" for the  net  profit,  when  compared  to  the
    accounts prepared by AWS.

15. At [25], the judge did not find the appellant to be a truthful witness.
    The fact the appellant had used a  different  firm  of  accountants  to
    submit his tax returns  to  those  who  relied  upon  for  the  Tier  1
    applications suggested deliberate dishonesty. See [25]. The judge found
    that it would be reasonable to expect the first appellant  to  have  an
    understanding of the taxi would be expected to  pay,  or  at  least  to
    declare accurate earnings to HMRC. The combined net profit of  �132,000
    across the three tax years, when viewed in light of  the  tax  paid  of
    �500 since 2009, "leads the respondent to question the  credibility  of
    the first appellant's self-employment earnings".

16. At [29], the judge found that  the  appellant  was  only  motivated  to
    correct  his  self-assessment  declaration  in  order  to   apply   for
    indefinite leave to remain. It was significant, found the  judge,  that
    the appellant only sought to correct  the  discrepancies  three  months
    before he made that application. At [33), the judge found that  it  was
    undesirable for the first appellant to be granted leave to remain.

17. The judge dismissed the appeals of both appellants under the rules  and
    outside the rules.

Permission to appeal

18. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Feeney on
    the basis that it was arguable that the judge erred in  describing  the
    appellant as having  provided  "accountancy  services",  as  he  was  a
    bookkeeper, but not an accountant. Judge Feeney also considered that it
    was arguable that the judge's analysis of the role of AWS  was  flawed;
    the judge said that their involvement was  revealed  only  through  the
    appellant's oral evidence, whereas the documentary evidence before  the
    judge arguably demonstrated that the firm had been involved previously,
    and that their involvement was not something which the appellant raised
    for the first time in oral evidence.

Submissions

19. The appellants submit that the judge erred in her credibility findings.
    The first  ground,  relating  to  the  incorrect  assumption  that  the
    appellant is an accountant, tainted her overall credibility assessment.
    At [20] of the first appellant's witness statement,  he  wrote  "I  had
    some experience of bookkeeping, but I had no experience or knowledge of
    the UK tax rules and I have never prepared a tax return..." Mr Gajjar's
    written submissions featured a job description of a  bookkeeper  which,
    Mr  Gajjar  wrote,  he  had  found  online  while  preparing  for   the
    proceedings: see [12]. The  list  of  duties  performed  by  a  typical
    bookkeeper did not include accountancy services, submitted Mr Gajjar.

20. Mr Gajjar also  submits  that  the  judge  reached  premature  findings
    concerning the first appellant's account of relying on Mr Patel at [18]
    of her decision, which was at an early stage in her analysis. This,  he
    submits, demonstrates a failure to consider the question of  dishonesty
    in the round with the remaining evidence on a holistic basis. As to the
    judge's concerns that the appellant had provided a vague explanation of
    how the error "came about",  the  appellant  had  provided  a  detailed
    account,  submits  Mr  Gajjar,  of  his  engagement  with  his  current
    accountants, Rizvi & Co., with which the judge  did  not  engage.   The
    judge had failed to distinguish between  cases  where  the  explanation
    provided for the tax discrepancy was simply that incorrect figures  had
    been given to  HMRC,  and  the  present  matter,  where  the  appellant
    believed the figure to be correct as he was relying on advice  to  that
    extent, particularly Mr Patel's advice that a great number of  everyday
    expenses were allowable against income tax liability.

21. Mr Gajjar also relied on the observations of Judge Feeney when granting
    permission to appeal.

22. The second ground of appeal contends that the judge failed  to  conduct
    the balancing exercise required by paragraph 322(5).

23. Written submissions made on behalf of the respondent contended that the
    judge was entitled to reach the decision she did,  and  that  she  took
    into account all relevant factors.

Discussion

24. This was an appeal which turned on  whether  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
    Immigration Rules was engaged in relation to the first appellant.  That
    paragraph provides that a discretionary ground for refusal is:

         "...the undesirability of permitting the person concerned to remain
         in the United Kingdom  in  the  light  of  his  conduct  (including
         convictions which do not fall within paragraph  322(1C),  character
         or associations or the fact that he represents a threat to national
         security..."

25. The judge found that the first appellant's  conduct  engaged  paragraph
    322(5), and that  it  would  not  be  disproportionate  to  expect  the
    appellants to leave the country.  Those were findings of fact.  Appeals
    may be brought to this tribunal on points of law not fact.  My role  is
    to decide whether the findings reached by the judge were open to her on
    the evidence, rather than to substitute my own view of the evidence.

26. In R (Iran) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2005]  EWCA
    Civ 982, the Court of Appeal outlined the categories of  factual  error
    which may amount to an error of law.  See [9]:

         "i) Making perverse or irrational findings on a matter  or  matters
         that were material to the outcome ("material matters");

         ii) Failing to give reasons or any adequate reasons for findings on
         material matters;

         iii) Failing to take into account and/or resolve conflicts of  fact
         or opinion on material matters;

         iv) Giving weight to immaterial matters;

         v) Making a material misdirection of law on any material matter;

         vi) Committing or permitting a  procedural  or  other  irregularity
         capable of making a material  difference  to  the  outcome  or  the
         fairness of the proceedings;

         vii) Making a  mistake  as  to  a  material  fact  which  could  be
         established by objective  and  uncontentious  evidence,  where  the
         appellant and/or his advisers were not responsible for the mistake,
         and where unfairness resulted from the  fact  that  a  mistake  was
         made."

27. The first appellant's submissions concerning the judge's  treatment  of
    the claimed role of Mr Patel were not  within  the  grounds  of  appeal
    originally advanced, nor  were  they  the  subject  of  any  additional
    observations by Judge Feeney when granting  permission  to  appeal.  It
    follows, therefore, that Mr Gajjar's submissions concerning the role of
    Mr Patel fall outside the jurisdiction of the tribunal  as  constituted
    to hear this appeal. Lest it be  said  that  the  point  is  "Robinson"
    obvious, I have considered the submissions in any event.

28. I do not consider that the  judge  fell  into  any  of  the  recognised
    categories of error in relation to her analysis of  Mr  Patel,  or  the
    remaining evidence in the case. It was plainly open  to  the  judge  to
    ascribe significance to the total absence of any  documentary  evidence
    concerning Mr Patel's claimed role, and the  general  incredibility  of
    the account provided by the appellant in relation to him.  Contrary  to
    what Mr Gajjar submitted, there was nothing irrational about the  judge
    expecting correspondence or other records of some  form  to  have  been
    generated by the  appellant's  reliance  on  Mr  Patel.   That  was  an
    entirely reasonable approach, and one which accords with  the  approach
    of the Court of Appeal in Balajigari v Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department [2019] EWCA Civ 673 at [106]:

         "...where  an  earnings  discrepancy  is  relied  on  (and  without
         changing the burden of proof, which remains  on  the  Secretary  of
         State so far as an allegation that an applicant  was  dishonest  is
         concerned), it is unlikely that a  tribunal  will  be  prepared  to
         accept a mere assertion from an applicant or their accountant  that
         the discrepancy on was  simply  'a  mistake'  without  a  full  and
         particularised explanation of what  the  mistake  was  and  how  it
         arose..."

29. While there is a relatively detailed account of how the  appellant  was
    advised by Rizvi & Co. of the existing tax discrepancies,  the  concern
    of the judge was that there was very little concerning  the  provenance
    of the error.  It was entirely reasonable for the judge to expect  that
    a process which by its very nature generates  a  significant  trail  of
    documents to have generated some documentation that would be  available
    to the First-tier Tribunal.  There was nothing.  The judge was entitled
    to reject the Patel narrative in the way that she did.

30. I turn now to whether the judge erred in referring to the appellant  as
    having expertise in "bookkeeping and accountancy services".

31. First, as I indicated at the hearing, I reject Mr Gajjar's  attempt  to
    introduce "evidence" of the typical functions of a bookkeeper. Not only
    has there not been an application under rule  15(2A)  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  to  adduce  new  evidence,  the
    online research conducted by Mr Gajjar did not produce material of  the
    sort which would attract weight in an assessment of this nature: it was
    a single printout from what appeared to be a careers website. The  term
    "bookkeeping" is one in everyday usage.  The judge had before  her  the
    first appellant's academic record, which he referred to at question  21
    of his credibility interview, stating that he had a degree in Business,
    Economics  and  Finance.   She  had  available  to  her  the   official
    transcript of his grades from the  University  of  Portsmouth  Business
    School which awarded the appellant the above degree, at Master's level.
    The modules he studied included Business Economics,  The  Economics  of
    Banking and Money, International Banking and Finance, Applied Corporate
    Finance, and Financial Forecasting.  It was entirely open to the  judge
    to expect this appellant to have some  form  of  expertise  in  matters
    relating to tax, profit and loss, therefore, such that his  explanation
    that he did not have any concerns arising from  the  state  of  affairs
    whereby his tax liability had been �500 against an income  of  �132,000
    lacked credibility.

32. Mr Gajjar submits that it was wrong for the refusal letter to  use  the
    term "accountancy services" and that the judge compounded that error by
    relying on it herself. I reject the submission. At question 51  of  his
    credibility interview, when asked to describe the qualifications of  Mr
    Patel, an individual claimed by the appellant to be an accountant,  the
    appellant himself described those very services as "bookkeeping".   The
    term "accountancy services" may legitimately  be  used  interchangeably
    with  "bookkeeping".   It   does   not   denote   formal   accountants'
    qualifications, although it may of course encompass those  who  are  so
    qualified.  The appellant himself described the role  performed  by  Mr
    Patel using the same terminology that he himself  adopted  to  describe
    the services that he provided to his own corporate clients.  It  cannot
    be said to have been irrational for the judge to adopt the  appellant's
    own terminology when rejecting the credibility of this  aspect  of  his
    account, nor to ascribe significance to the appellant's  qualifications
    in  the  field.   The  first  appellant  purported  to  have   provided
    bookkeeping as part  of  his  business  consultancy  services;  it  was
    entirely rational for the judge to have rejected his suggestion that he
    was misled by Mr Patel (in relation to whom, of course, there had  been
    no evidence whatsoever), especially given  he  had  separately  yet  in
    parallel represented to the respondent that he made  significant  self-
    employed profits during the same period.

33. Against that background, it was entirely rational for the judge to have
    significant credibility  concerns  arising  from  this  aspect  of  the
    appellant's case. It is nothing to the point that the  judge  expressed
    concerns about  the  credibility  of  the  appellant  at  [18]  of  her
    decision. Far from putting the coach before the horses,  as  Mr  Gajjar
    submits,  the  judge  was  expressing  a  credibility   concern   which
    corresponded to the analysis that she had  just  conducted.  There  was
    nothing later in the decision, or in  the  remaining  evidence  in  the
    case, which would have mitigated against that  conclusion.   There  was
    nothing in the remaining analysis of the judge that was  a  "bolt  on".
    It is necessary for judges to express some reasons before others, which
    is all the judge did here.

34. In relation to the judge's concerns about AWS, it is necessary  to  set
    out the judge's observations in full:

         "[20] The additional matter which causes me significant concern  is
         the fact that the first  appellant  had  in  fact  engaged  another
         accountancy firm, AWS  to  prepare  profit  and  loss  accounts  in
         support of the two Tier 1 applications for the UKVI. This  firm  is
         not mentioned in his witness statement prepared for this appeal. It
         only became apparent during the course of his oral evidence that he
         had in fact engaged one  accountant  to  assist  with  preparing  a
         profit and loss account to support the Tier 1 application  for  the
         UKVI and allegedly another accountant, Mr Patel the submissions  of
         a self-assessment tax return."

35. Mr Gajjar correctly highlights that references to AWS featured  in  the
    appellant's bundle, and that their existence was not revealed  for  the
    first time in the appellant's oral evidence. It was  simply  wrong,  he
    submits, for the judge to  conclude  that  the  existence  of  AWS  was
    something the appellant introduced for  the  first  time  in  his  oral
    evidence.  I do not consider the judge, properly  understood,  to  have
    fallen into error on this point. The judge was correct  to  state  that
    AWS  did  not  feature  in  the  appellant's  witness  statement.   The
    appellant's reliance on Mr Patel, by contrast,  did.  The  concern  the
    judge is expressing in this paragraph is the contrasting  advice  given
    to the appellant by AWS, on the one hand, and Mr Patel, on  the  other,
    did not feature in the first appellant's witness statement. Her concern
    is not the late suggestion of the existence of  AWS,  for  AWS  plainly
    were involved at a much earlier stage, but the fact that  two  separate
    accountants were involved at the material time, and the fact  that  two
    significantly contrasting sets of advice were purportedly given to  the
    appellant. It was  entirely  rational  for  the  judge  to  expect  the
    appellant to have sought to  reconcile  the  conflicting  services  and
    advice provided by each in his statement.  The fact that he only did so
    during his oral evidence was a credibility concern that was open to the
    judge to have.  The narrative provided by the first  appellant  in  his
    witness statement was devoid of any reference to AWS, and  that  was  a
    matter the judge was entitled to take into account.

36. It is nothing to the point that Rizvi & Co.  subsequently  advised  the
    appellant  to  correct  his  inaccurate  tax  returns.   Any   credible
    accountant would readily have identified the significant  discrepancies
    in the appellant's tax declaration history involving a tax liability of
    �500 against profit of �132,000. The concern  of  the  judge,  and  the
    central issues in the appeal, related to the appellant's conduct at the
    time he made the Tier 1 applications,  and  the  vastly  differing  tax
    declarations  to  HMRC.  That  a  narrative  may  have  been   provided
    concerning a third party's subsequent identification  of  those  errors
    does not undermine the judge's legitimate findings of fact she  reached
    concerning the appellant's conduct at that time.

37. The judge was, therefore, entitled to  find  that  the  respondent  had
    discharged the initial evidential  burden  of  demonstrating  that  the
    appellant had engaged in dishonest conduct, either in  relation  to  an
    under declaration of his income to HMRC, or an over-declaration of  his
    income to the respondent, or a  combination  of  both.  The  evidential
    burden  thus  shifted  to  the  appellant  to   provide   an   innocent
    explanation.  I  reject  Mr  Gajjar's  submission  that  the  appellant
    provided an explanation satisfying the minimum level  of  plausibility,
    such that the judge was bound to accept it. The judge reached  findings
    of fact that were open to her on the evidence, and in relation to which
    it is not within the remit of this tribunal to interfere.  None of  the
    categories in R (Iran) is engaged and there are  no  other  bases  upon
    which it may properly be said the judge fell into error in relation  to
    her findings of fact.

38. Ground 1 is without merit.

39. Ground 2 contends that  the  judge  failed  to  conduct  the  balancing
    exercise required in relation to  paragraphs  276B(ii)  and  paragraphs
    322(5) of the Immigration Rules.

40. The judge addressed whether paragraph 322(5) should be invoked in these
    terms:

         "[32] having regard to the totality of the evidence  before  me,  I
         find the respondent has discharged the burden of proving  that  the
         first appellant has been deliberately dishonest.

         [33] I find it was open  to  the  respondent  to  invoke  paragraph
         322(5) on the facts of this case.  I  find  the  first  appellant's
         conduct in deliberately misleading the UKVI and HMRC to  be  wholly
         reprehensible.  I  find  that  it  is  undesirable  for  the  first
         appellant to be granted leave to remain."

41. Mr Gajjar submits that this analysis falls foul of the need to  conduct
    a balancing exercise.  The mere fact of engaging in  dishonest  conduct
    is insufficient; it is necessary to conduct a  broader  assessment,  in
    two stages, he subsmits.  At [34] of Balajigari, the  Court  of  Appeal
    summarised the analysis required in the following terms:

         "[34]     As to the first stage, Mr Biggs submitted that there  are
         three limbs to the analysis. There must be: (i)  reliable  evidence
         of  (ii)  sufficiently  reprehensible   conduct;   and   (iii)   an
         assessment, taking proper account  of  all  relevant  circumstances
         known about the applicant at the date of decision, of  whether  his
         or her presence in the  UK  is  undesirable  (this  should  include
         evidence of positive features  of  their  character).  Again,  that
         seems to us a correct and helpful analysis of the exercise required
         at the first stage, but it will be useful  to  say  something  more
         about the elements in it, especially as they apply to  an  earnings
         discrepancy case."

42. At [39], the Court of Appeal addressed the second stage:

         "[39]     Mr Biggs submitted that  at  this  second  stage  of  the
         analysis the Secretary of State must separately  consider  whether,
         notwithstanding the conclusion that  it  was  undesirable  for  the
         applicant to have leave to remain, there were  factors  outweighing
         the presumption that leave should for that reason  be  refused.  He
         submitted that it is at this stage that the Secretary of State must
         consider such factors as the welfare of any minor children who  may
         be affected adversely by the decision and any human  rights  issues
         which arise. That seems to us in  principle  correct.  There  will,
         though no doubt only exceptionally, be cases where the interests of
         children or others, or serious  problems  about  removal  to  their
         country of origin, mean that it would be wrong to refuse  leave  to
         remain (though not  necessarily indefinite leave  to  remain)  to
         migrants whose presence is undesirable."

43. The judge's analysis of the first stage of the test, at [33],  although
    brisk, was in line with the relevant criteria.  She (i) found there  to
    be reliable evidence; of (ii) sufficiently  reprehensible  conduct  ("I
    find the first appellant's conduct in deliberately  misleading  the  UK
    VRA and HMRC to be  wholly  representable");  that  (iii)  rendered  it
    undesirable for the appellant to be granted leave to  remain.  Although
    the judge did not identify any positive characteristics  of  the  first
    appellant's character which would be relevant to point (iii), Mr Gajjar
    did not draw my attention to any factors which the judge overlooked  in
    this regard.

44. I accept the submission that the judge did not perform the second stage
    of the analysis at that  point  in  her  decision.   However,  she  did
    perform an overall balancing exercise in the paragraphs that  followed.
    There has been no challenge to the following findings she reached:  the
    appellants both speak English and are  financially  independent;  their
    presence is not likely to be damaging to the economic well-being of the
    United Kingdom, and they are likely to be able to integrate  [39];  the
    appellants are both in the United Kingdom lawfully, albeit pursuant  to
    a precarious immigration status [40]; the first appellant came  to  the
    United Kingdom aged 27,  thereby  attracting  significant  weight;  the
    first appellant has spent the majority of his life in Pakistan, and  it
    is  likely  that  he  still  retains  cultural,  social,  familial  and
    linguistic ties; he obtained post-graduate qualifications and formed  a
    business in this country, and that will place him in  good  stead  upon
    his return to Pakistan; there was nothing to indicate  that  he  had  a
    significant health condition which would present difficulties  for  his
    reintegration to society; if needed, he would have the support  of  his
    family upon his return [42].   Addressing  the  second  appellant,  the
    judge found that she had a limited private life in the United  Kingdom,
    having only arrived in 2014.  She made similar findings concerning  the
    second appellant's ability to reintegrate in Pakistan to those she made
    concerning the first [43].

45. The judge addressed the best interests of the appellants children.   At
    [46] she found  that  the  children  were  "wholly  unlikely"  to  have
    developed any private life outside the family home, given their age. It
    would be in their best interests to remain with their parents, who  are
    their primary carers. The judge found that the children were likely  to
    be able to readjust to life in Pakistan, given they would be  returning
    with a supportive family unit. There has been  no  challenge  to  those
    findings.

46. At [47], the judge found that the appellants and their  children  enjoy
    family life together in this country. Their return  to  Pakistan  would
    not interfere with that live, as they would be together, and  would  be
    able to continue family life there.

47. In concluding, the judge addressed the proportionality of  the  overall
    decision to remove the first appellant. She said:

         "[48] I have given significant weight to the fact  that  the  first
         appellant has been dishonest in his dealings with  the  UK  VI  and
         HMRC. I find the first appellant's conduct to be  reprehensible.  I
         do not find it desirable that persons  who  have  chosen  to  evade
         their tax responsibilities and/or falsely inflated their income  to
         UK VI should be permitted to remain in the UK.

         [49] Having weighed the factors for and against the grant of  leave
         to remain, I find that the scales in  this  case  is  (sic)  tipped
         firmly in favour of the respondent.  Having  found  the  first  and
         second appellant and the children could readjust easily to life  in
         Pakistan, I find  that  there  is  nothing  to  indicate  that  the
         immigration decision would be a disproportionate interference  with
         their private and family life."

48. Mr Gajjar submits that the judge should have considered  the  fact  the
    second appellant works in a care home, providing support to  vulnerable
    people as a care assistant, and her voluntary work  at  the  mosque.  I
    find that  had  the  judge  expressly  addressed  that  aspect  of  the
    appellants' case, it would not have been capable of making  a  material
    difference. There is no suggestion that the second  appellant  has  any
    qualifications that feature on shortage occupation list,  or  that  the
    role she currently performs could not be filled by  another  person  in
    the event she were required to leave the country.   Volunteering  at  a
    mosque is not a factor that rationally could have led  to  a  different
    outcome.  The judge was not under a duty to repeat back to the  parties
    the evidence upon which they relied.

49. Read as a whole, the judge considered all relevant factors which  could
    have been expressly addressed at [33] of her decision, pursuant to  the
    second stage of the Baljigari approach to applying rule  322(5).  There
    were no issues that would be capable of affecting the  welfare  of  the
    two children involved, nor other human rights issues mitigating against
    the removal of the appellants.

50. The decision of the judge did not involve the making of an error of law
    on a material point.

51. These appeals are dismissed.
