Representation:

Mrs S Poulter for the entry clearance officer
                         sponsor, in person

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   This is a Home Office appeal against the decision of an adjudicator,  Mr
   Mr P Bompas Shaerf,  sitting  at  Taylor  House  on  12  February  2004,
   allowing the appeal of a citizen of the Philippines against  refusal  of
   entry clearance to come here as a student on a three-year course leading
   to a diploma in Health and Social Care. The notice of  refusal  set  out
   the Entry Clearance Officer's reasons at some length: the relevant  ones
   referred to the claimant's English  ability,  and  to  the  question  of
   whether  the  course  she  proposed  to  study  was  available  in   the
   Philippines.  The adjudicator's decision is challenged  on  the  way  on
   which he dealt with those points and also in respect of what he  had  to
   say about the claimant's intention to  leave  this  country   after  the
   course:

   19.   Intention to leave  at  the  end  of  the  proposed  course  whose
        duration is three years, is difficult to assess.  I accept that  the
        appellant has been unclear as to her intentions at the  end  of  the
        course.  This may reflect her general uncertainty and also that  she
        has focused on coming to the United Kingdom to undertake the  course
        rather than in detail on what she will do at the end of the course.


      20.  She would be leaving her husband  and  her  only  child  in  the
        Philippines. On the evidence before me, I am satisfied  that  it  is
        more likely than not that the appellant will return to  her  husband
        and child in the Philippines at the end of her studies.

2. What the appellant had said at interview in answer to questions on  this
   point was this:

   17.      How will the course benefit you?
      (Answer) More on social care and through  study  and  I  can  get  an
         advanced diploma and when I come back here I can find a job.


    18.     What will you do on completion of your studies?
         Answer:  Come back here then may be get a job in UK or here.


3. The evidence on this point certainly was ambiguous and the claimant  may
   be regarded as fortunate as to have had the  favourable  decision  which
   she did from the adjudicator on it.  However, Mrs Poulter  realistically
   conceded that the adjudicator's decision on this point cannot be said to
   involve an error of law, which leaves us with those taken in the  notice
   of refusal on the claimant's standard of English and the availability of
   such courses in the Philippines.

4. There was no finding on  either  of  these  points  by  the  adjudicator
   although they had been clearly taken in the notice of  refusal  and,  at
   least so far as the availability of other courses are concerned, pursued
   by the presenting officer at the hearing: see paragraph 13.    That  was
   in our view certainly an error of law.

5. So far as the claimant's standard of English is concerned,  the  refusal
   on that ground was based on her choice  to  be  interviewed  through  an
   interpreter in Tagalog. It is said in the explanatory statement:

   As a matter of course here in  the  British  Embassy  we  routinely  ask
   applicant in which language they wish to conduct their interview and  if
   they need an interpreter.  The fact that this interview was conducted in
   Tagalog with an official interpreter was because the appellant requested
   it.

6. We do not regard that as an  adequate  opportunity  for  applicants  for
   entry clearance to demonstrate their knowledge of English.  In our view,
   if the fact that a applicant has chosen to be interviewed in her  native
   language is to be relied on to show her lack of English,  then  a  clear
   warning should be given first that it is for her to show  her  knowledge
   of English, and interview through  an  interpreter  may  not  make  this
   possible.

7. There still needed to be evidence and a finding by  the  adjudicator  on
   the claimant's standard of English.  We have had some  evidence  in  the
   form of an official transcript of her school record which shows that  at
   the end of her studies she got a mark of 90% in her English examination.
     That in itself might not necessarily say anything conclusive about the
   spoken English she would require to follow a  course  in  this  country.
   However, as most reasonably well-informed people know, English  is  very
   much used to this day in the Philippines.  We  note  from  the  official
   transcript that all the courses taken (including, interestingly, "Social
   Graces") are denominated in English, with the exception of two named  in
   Tagalog.

8. Together with the sponsor's assurance that these courses were taught  in
   English, we regard that as sufficient evidence that  this  claimant  did
   have at least reasonable English skills, and Mrs Poulter did not suggest
   that that was a conclusion to which we would not be  entitled  to  come.
   If the claimant had needed remedial English, we should have regarded Mrs
   Poulter's other point about the letter (sent after the decision on 8 May
   2003) as reasonably made, in that the course had already been going  for
   a month by that time, and, if it had been  needed,  serious  improvement
   the claimant's English might have been difficult at that stage; but, for
   the reasons we have given, that does not arise.

9. That leaves us with the other point about the  availability  of  similar
   courses in the Philippines.    This is put forward  in  the  grounds  of
   appeal on the basis of the Tribunal decision  in  Nduhura  [2002]  UKIAT
   01613.  It was not suggested by  Mrs  Poulter  that  this  decision  was
   anything more than one on the facts of the  case,  which  showed  simply
   that the availability of similar courses  in  a  claimant's  country  of
   origin was something that did need to be taken into  account.   Clearly,
   as we have said  it  was  a  live  issue  in  this  case,  and  one  the
   adjudicator did need to deal with, although it would not have  prevented
   him finding in the claimant's favour if he had done so.

10. We do not think this is a point we can  resolve  for  ourselves  in  the
   same way as we have done with the question  of  the  claimant's  English
   ability.   It had a bearing on the whole question of her  intention,  or
   not, to stay here after she had finished the course for  which  she  had
   applied.   We do not think it  would  be  right  to  ask  Mr  Shaerf  to
   reconsider this case on the question of the availability of such courses
   in the Philippines,  because  in  effect  he  had  already  decided  the
   question to which that was relevant.  The claimant's case on this point,
   as put by the sponsor, is quite  simply  that  a  British  qualification
   would have greater value world-wide than a Filipino one.   This may well
   be right and is also something that needs to be taken into account.

11. However, we should make clear that where a serious  issue  is  taken  in
   the refusal notice, and particularly if it is pursued by the  presenting
   officer before the adjudicator, it does need  to  be  dealt  with.    We
   cannot supply that deficiency in Mr Shaerf's decision for the reasons we
   have given, and the result is that there must be a fresh hearing  before
   another adjudicator, which however will be limited to  the  question  of
   whether this claimant intended to leave this country at the end  of  her
   studies here, and need not be concerned with her English abilities.   To
   that extent the Home Office appeal is allowed and the case remitted, not
   to Mr Shaerf.

                                                                       [pic]
