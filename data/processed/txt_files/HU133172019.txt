                      ERROR Of LAW FINDING AND REASONS


    1. The appellant  appeals  with  permission  a  decision  of  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Aujla ('the Judge') promulgated on 19 December 2019 in
       which the Judge dismissed  the  appellants  appeal  on  human  rights
       grounds.
    2. Permission to appeal was granted by another judge of the  First  tier
       Tribunal; the operative part of the  grant  being  in  the  following
       terms:

           "In his decision, the Judge observed that there were aspects  of
           the   evidence   which   would   be   better   suited    to    a
           protection/Article 3 claim. Arguably, he erred by excluding them
           from his  consideration  of  very  significant  obstacles  under
           paragraph 276 ADE. He was clearly not assisted by the fact  that
           there were no grounds of appeal.  The  Judge's  case  management
           powers under Rule 4 of the Procedure Rules entitled him to limit
           the number of live witnesses to be  called,  especially  as  the
           Respondent was not represented and so there would  be  no  cross
           examination. Apart from identifying the names of the  witnesses,
           it is arguable that the Judge failed to consider their  evidence
           given that he makes no further  reference  to  it.  It  is  also
           arguable, from paragraph 29 of  the  decision,  that  the  Judge
           considered that the appeal was being advanced solely on  private
           life grounds. It was obvious from the Appellant's statement that
           he considered  that  he  had  a  family  life  in  the  UK  and,
           regardless of the strength or weakness of such an argument,  the
           Judge was duty bound to consider it.


           In the circumstances, I grant permission to appeal. All  grounds
           are arguable, as they are clearly interlinked."


Background

    3. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 1 January  1988.  He
       had lived in the United Kingdom for 11  years  at  the  date  of  the
       hearing.
    4. The Judge records the appellants immigration  history  before  noting
       the appeal came before him for hearing as a float case, after he  had
       finished his appointed list, and that Counsel who had represented the
       respondent earlier in the other appeals had left the building by  the
       time this appeal was allocated to the Judge;  meaning  there  was  no
       representative available for the respondent.
    5. At [15] the Judge writes:

           "I had preliminary  discussions  with  Mr  �  Ceallaigh  at  the
           beginning of the hearing. I noted from  the  Appellant's  bundle
           AB1 that, in addition to the witness statement of the Appellant,
           there were 14 other witness statements  and  the  courtroom  was
           full of people who had accompanied the Appellant. In view of the
           fact that the issue before me was  very  narrow,  whether  there
           were very significant obstacles to the  Appellant's  integration
           into Bangladesh on his return, I asked Mr � Ceallaigh about  the
           number of witnesses. He stated  that  he  would  be  calling  10
           witnesses in addition to the Appellant. He was not able to  draw
           my attention to any correspondence from  those  instructing  him
           informing the tribunal said there would be 11 witnesses so  that
           extra time could be allowed, if considered appropriate. In  view
           of the narrowness of the issue, I indicated to him that I  would
           allow him to call two witnesses in addition to the Appellant and
           he could decide who he  wanted  to  call.  He  agreed  and  then
           decided on the names of  his  the  two  witnesses  he  would  be
           calling."

    6. In relation to procedural issues one can have sympathy  for  a  judge
       who having completed the list allocated to them is willing to  assist
       the Tribunal by taking on additional work, including cases  allocated
       to the float list. Any judge so doing is not required  to  deal  with
       such a case  "come  what  may"  and  must  still  have  in  mind  the
       overriding objectives and the principles of  justice;  including  the
       primary question of whether a party appearing  before  that  tribunal
       will receive a fair hearing. Even if the appellant's  representatives
       did not contact the tribunal administration to  advise  them  of  the
       substantial number of witnesses to be called, it may be  argued  that
       the blame for what occurred lays with them  and  not  the  appellant.
       Even with a substantial number of witnesses,  as  in  this  case,  if
       witness statements had been filed  and  cross  examination  (if  any)
       brief it may still have been possible to hear  the  case  within  the
       allocated time of two or three hours.
    7. The grounds on which permission to appeal was granted  are  threefold
       namely (1) the Judge failed to  consider  the  appellants  case  that
       there were very significant obstacles to his returning to Bangladesh,
       (2) in failing to consider the Appellants family  life  and  (3)   in
       failing to consider the appellants case that his removal  will  be  a
       breach of Article 8 ECHR outside the Immigration Rules.
    8. It is necessary when examining the grounds to go back to  the  nature
       of the application made by the appellant.
    9. The appellant's immigration history shows that on  13  June  2017  he
       applied out of time for  leave  to  remain  outside  the  Immigration
       Rules. That application was varied on 29 September 2017 for leave  to
       remain outside the Rules which was further varied on 5 February  2018
       to leave to remain outside the Rules on the basis of  an  application
       for indefinite leave to remain. The application form SET(O) completed
       and submitted is the prescribed form  seeking  settlement,  ILR,  for
       reasons not specifically provided for elsewhere. The application form
       at Section 3 provides several categories in which an application  can
       be made, one of which is stated to be "other purposes or reasons  not
       covered by other application forms". It is  this  category  that  the
       appellant  ticked  as  being  applicable.   In  the  section  on  the
       following page it is written "if you have ticked the  other  purposes
       or reasons category, please explain briefly why you are applying  for
       indefinite leave to remain in the UK. You will also need to provide a
       letter explaining in more  detail  why  you  are  applying,  and  the
       category of your last grant of leave" to which  the  appellant  wrote
       "please see my attached cover letter".
   10. That letter written by the appellant, dated 2 February 2018, sets out
       the appellants  case  seeking  leave  to  remain  outside  the  Rules
       referring to length of residence in the United Kingdom, lack of  ties
       to Bangladesh , strong family life in the United  Kingdom,  education
       and professional qualifications in the United Kingdom as a barrister,
       a request to grant indefinite leave to remain so  the  appellant  can
       pursue his  career  in  the  United  Kingdom,  a  claim  it  will  be
       impossible for the appellant to return  to  Bangladesh  and  work  in
       legal practise as a result of the existing violence and oppression in
       that country, the fact his  father  was  a  prominent  leader  of  an
       opposition political party, as more particularly set out and expanded
       upon in that document.
   11. The respondents refusal dated 12 July 2019 states the  appellant  had
       not raised any compelling enough reasons for him to be considered for
       indefinite leave to remain claiming he had no spouse or  children  in
       the UK and that he would not be issued  indefinite  leave  to  remain
       under compelling circumstances in regard to his family life.  It  was
       acknowledging the appellant claimed to face persecution in Bangladesh
       which the decision maker stated amounted to a protection  claim  that
       would  only  be  addressed  under  compassionate  factors  with   the
       appellant able to claim asylum if protection issues are  raised;  but
       that on the facts there was nothing  compelling  enough  to  consider
       whether that warranted a  grant  of  leave  outside  the  Immigration
       Rules. In relation to the rules themselves  the  decision  maker  did
       consider family life stating that as the appellant had not  told  him
       about a partner or dependent children his claim had not considered in
       relation to family life under Appendix FM but in relation to  private
       life  pursuant  to  paragraph  276  ADE  only.   It  was  found   the
       application did not fall for refusal on grounds  of  suitability  but
       fell for refused on the grounds of eligibility as the  appellant  did
       not have at least 20 years in the  United  Kingdom.  In  relation  to
       whether there were very significant  obstacles  to  integration  into
       Bangladesh the decision maker rejected the appellants assertion  such
       very significant obstacles existed, for the reasons set  out  in  the
       refusal  letter.   In  relation  to  exceptional  circumstances,  the
       decision maker concluded no such circumstances existed but noted  the
       appellant had made representations in relation to  family  ties  with
       the sister and nephew and  close  emotional  ties  with  such  family
       members.  It  was  not,  however,  accepted  that  such   exceptional
       circumstances did exist.
   12. What does not appear  to  have  been  considered  in  detail  in  the
       decision letter is whether the  appellant's  claim  his  family  life
       engaged article 8 was accepted as there  does  not  appear  to  be  a
       specific finding for or against this proposition in the letter.   Nor
       does it appear that notwithstanding the author of the decision letter
       stating that  the  claim  the  appellant  will  face  persecution  in
       Bangladesh which amounted to a protection  claim  will  be  addressed
       under compassionate circumstances, that any  such  consideration  was
       properly given to such matters based upon  the  information  provided
       when assessing if  there  were  compassionate  factors  in  the  case
       sufficient to warrant a grant of leave to  remain outside the Rules.
   13. The Judge was not at all assisted in this  appeal  by  the  fact  the
       appellant's representative failed to include any  grounds  of  appeal
       with the application.
   14. Mr � Ceallaigh in his application for permission  to  appeal  to  the
       Upper Tribunal, Ground 2, writes:

           "10    The FTT complained  [13]  separately  appellant  had  not
                submitted grounds of appeal. That criticism must be accepted
                and certainly grounds should have been lodged.


           11     However,  when  counsel  at  the  hearing  asked  if  the
                skeleton argument could stand his grounds of appeal the FTTJ
                Refused on the basis that this would "not  be  appropriate".
                In the determination, the FTTJ then asserted at [13] "I have
                assumed that the appellant claimed  that  he  satisfied  the
                requirements of the Immigration Rules in respect to  private
                life and the respondent's decision  was  in  breach  of  his
                Article 8 rights". There was no need for the FTT to 'assume'
                what the appellants case was; it was set out in  writing  in
                front of him.


           12     In fact, the Appellant had relied not only on his private
                life but also on his family life  [appellants  statement  at
                [8] [21], and family members' statements; skeleton  argument
                at [45]; [30-36]. The Appellant had been living in the  same
                household for a decade, and was extremely close to his eight
                year old nephew as a result, being more  akin  to  a  second
                father than an uncle. Their separation would  have  a  major
                impact on the child  [and  the  Appellant].  An  Independent
                Social Workers report was submitted in support of this case.
                Several witnesses attested to this also.


           13     The FTT however decided that the  sole  issue  "was  very
                narrow, whether they were very significant obstacles to  the
                Appellant's integration into Bangladesh" [15]. The  FTT  did
                not consider the appellants family life, or his relationship
                with his nephew, at all.


           14     It was also because of the 'narrowness' of the issues  in
                the appeal that  the  FTT  refused  outright  to  hear  from
                several of the witnesses.  Although the FTT asserts that the
                intention was to call 10 witnesses, there were in fact 6 who
                had come to give evidence of the Appellants unusually strong
                connexions to the  United  Kingdom,  his  closeness  to  his
                family in this country, and his character. The FTTJ asserted
                that  he  would  permit  no  more  than  2  to  adopt  their
                statements, even though there was no presenting officer  and
                so there would be  no  cross  examination.  Nothing  in  the
                determination suggests that any  of  the  content  of  those
                statements was considered, save for the  FTT's  listing  the
                evidence.


           15     The FTT did not consider the Appellants case that he  had
                family life in the United Kingdom. None of  the  submissions
                or  evidence  in  respect  of  the  Appellant's  exceptional
                closeness to his family were referred to, whether  from  the
                Appellant himself, in the witness statements or in  the  ISW
                report.


           16     The appellant submits that in  failing  to  consider  his
                family life the FTT urging law."

   15. There is merit in the submission made to the Upper Tribunal  that  if
       the Judge had considered the family life claim but ruled that article
       8(1) was not engaged on the evidence in relation to family life  such
       evidence would still have been material  to  the  appellants  private
       life and relevant to the proportionality of any interference with the
       same pursuant to Article 8 (2).
   16. Mr � Ceallaigh's application for permission to appeal  also  contains
       an additional footnote which was relied upon in his oral  submissions
       in the following terms "It is striking that the FTTJ  gives  concerns
       about time as the basis for this decision. The matter  came  on  just
       before 13.30. The FTTJ interrupted counsel's closing  submissions  to
       announce that the decision was reserved and the hearing was concluded
       at 13.51. The Appellant, who had himself appeared in  the  FTT  as  a
       lawyer before, and the witnesses who were  also  immigration  lawyers
       and had come to give evidence, were somewhat taken  aback.  The  FTTJ
       also asserts that counsel "agreed" that only 2  witnesses  should  be
       called - that is simply not true.
   17. A further issue of potential unfairness is said  to  have  arisen  in
       relation to the Judges  consideration  of  whether  there  were  very
       significant obstacles to the appellant returning to Bangladesh. It is
       said that the material before the Judge contains an assertion that it
       will be very difficult for the appellant to integrate  into  life  in
       Bangladesh, including the  fact  that  because  the  appellant  is  a
       qualified barrister this will give him a political profile, that  his
       father had a political profile that will place him at risk,  that  he
       himself is opposed to the current regime, and will be  unwilling  and
       unable to keep  silent  about  his  opposition  if  returned.  It  is
       asserted in the grounds:

           "6 The FTT refused outright to consider these factors [32]. That
                was an error of law. The reason the FTT asserted that  these
                matters were to be ignored was because the Appellant had not
                made a protection claim [32].  The  Appellant  submits  that
                the FTT was not entitled to take this approach, which is not
                justified in statute  or  under  the  Procedure  Rules,  and
                moreover that this is a procedural issue upon which it would
                be helpful for the Upper Tribunal to give guidance."

   18. It is not clear why there is a need for guidance to be  given  as  an
       individual is entitled to have all matters they raise in relation  to
       an appeal  considered  by  the  judicial  body  responsible.  It  was
       acknowledged in the refusal letter that the  matters  raised  by  the
       appellant could form part of a protection claim which  the  appellant
       as  a  qualified  barrister  who  has  practised  in  the  field   of
       immigration law would have been fully aware. The fact he chose not to
       pursue that avenue is a matter for him, but it is not made  out  that
       prevents him from relying upon such evidence if  it  is  relevant  to
       another matter upon which a court or tribunal had to decide, which in
       this  case  was  whether  there  were  very   significant   obstacles
       preventing his  integration  to  Bangladesh  on  return.  Any  person
       adopting such an approach will be aware that the  lower  standard  of
       proof would be applicable to a protection  claim  whereas  the  civil
       standard, the balance of probabilities, will be applicable to a human
       rights claim. It is not the case, as it may be in a  judicial  review
       claim, of finding that the remedy sought must be the 'remedy of  last
       resort' to be refused if an alternative avenue is open to  the  party
       bringing the matter before the court.
   19. The approach of the Judge in not properly considering such issues  is
       also highlighted by the finding at  [33]  that  the  appellant  could
       easily reintegrate because he was a qualified barrister who would  be
       operating in professional circles as a professional man and a lawyer;
       when it was the appellants case that the very fact  of  his  being  a
       barrister placed him  at  risk,  that  the  idea  of  practising  was
       impossible, and that a key part of his private life is that he  spent
       a number of  years  achieving  his  qualifications  and  could  be  a
       practising lawyer in the United Kingdom which would be too  dangerous
       for him in Bangladesh.
   20. There is merit in the submission that the cumulative  effect  of  the
       concerns raised in the  grounds  seeking  permission  to  appeal,  as
       acknowledged in the grant  of  permission  to  appeal,  is  that  the
       appellant has not received a proper fair hearing  of  his  appeal  in
       this matter. In particular it appears the Judge, having decided  that
       he could proceed even though there were no grounds  of  appeal,  then
       rejected the submission that the skeleton argument could  have  stood
       as the grounds of appeal and then made an  unfair  assumption  as  to
       what the case was actually about, which was clearly not the case  set
       out in the skeleton argument or  any  evidence  relied  upon  by  the
       appellant.
   21. It is clear that the Judges assumption that the appeal was only to be
       decided on a very narrow issue of 'very significant obstacles' denied
       the appellant the opportunity to have the full range of issues relied
       upon properly considered by the Tribunal.  It is also clear  that  in
       assessing 'very significant obstacles' the Judge improperly  excluded
       from consideration, or failed to make adequate  findings  in  respect
       of, a major aspect of the appellants case  on  the  basis  the  Judge
       considered such matters should  form  part  of  a  protection  claim.
       Whilst that may be the  case,  it  did  not  excuse  the  Judge  from
       factoring such matters into consideration of  the  'very  significant
       obstacles to integration' aspect of the case.  It is also clearly the
       case the appellant has not had proper consideration of his  assertion
       his removal from the United Kingdom will breach his  protected  human
       rights which he pleads on the basis of private and  family  life;  in
       relation to which there has been no proper or adequate analysis.
   22. I find in light of the above the determination must be set aside with
       there being no preserved findings. The failure to  consider  relevant
       aspects  of  this  case  properly  had  denied  the   appellant   the
       opportunity to have his case fully properly and fairly considered  by
       a judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  Accordingly  I  consider,  in
       accordance  with  the  Presidential  guidance  and   the   overriding
       objectives that the only option available in relation to this  appeal
       (in which the Judge failed to deal  with  issues  raised,  failed  to
       properly consider the basis of the appeal, and  committed  procedural
       unfairness in limiting the grounds of appeal  to  be  considered  and
       witness evidence the appellant  was  seeking  to  rely  upon  in  his
       support of his case in light of the mistaken belief that  the  issues
       were "narrow") is that the appeal  be  remitted  to  the  First  tier
       Tribunal sitting at Taylor House to be considered by  a  judge  other
       than Judge Aujla.
   23. In light of the issues and evidence to be relied  upon  it  does  not
       appear appropriate that the case should  be  assigned  to  the  float
       list.  It is also a case that should be allocated a time estimate  of
       at least three hours and in which the appellant  must  file  a  clear
       stamen of the grounds of appeal he is seeking to rely upon in support
       of his appeal.



Decision

   24. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law.  I  set  aside
       the decision of the original Judge. I remit the appeal to the  First-
       tier Tribunal sitting at Taylor House to be heard afresh by  a  judge
       of that tribunal other than Judge Aujla. There shall be no  preserved
       findings.

  Anonymity.

   25. The First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
       45(4)(i) of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
       2005.

         I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
         (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
