               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr G Davidson of S Satha & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. These are the appellants' appeals against the decision of Judge Traynor
    made following a decision without a hearing at Taylor House on 3rd  May
    2017.

 2. The appellants are citizens of Ghana born on 18th March and 19th  April
    1969 respectively.  On 7th July  2015  they  made  applications  for  a
    residence card as confirmation of a right to reside in  the  UK  as  an
    extended family member of a person exercising treaty rights in  the  UK
    pursuant  to  Regulations  8  and  17(4)  of  the   Immigration   (EEA)
    Regulations 2006.  In his decision Judge Traynor concluded that he  had
    no jurisdiction to consider the appeal following the decision  in  Sala
    (EFMs: Right of Appeal) Albania [2016] UKUT 00411 (IAC).

 3. In the light of Khan v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2017] EWCA Civ 1755 both Mr Davidson and  Mr  Tufan  agreed  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal was wrong in law to conclude that it did  not  have
    jurisdiction to hear the appeal.  Both agreed that  the  proper  course
    was to set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and remit  the
    case to another First-tier Tribunal Judge, i.e. not Judge  Traynor,  to
    be heard afresh.

Notice of Decision

 4. Accordingly, the decisions dated 5th  May  2017  are  set  aside.   The
    appeal will be relisted at Taylor House with a Twee interpreter.  There
    will be two  witnesses  in  addition  to  the  sponsor.   No  anonymity
    direction is made.
