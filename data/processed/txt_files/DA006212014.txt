Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms E Savage, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr M Blundell, Counsel instructed by UK Immigration
                    Lawyers


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I make an order prohibiting the disclosure or publication  of  any
    matter likely to lead members of the public to identify the  appellant.
    Breach of this order can be punished as a contempt  of  court.  I  make
    this order because the respondent's wife and their children might be at
    risk of violence in the United Kingdom if their identities  are  known.
    This order is not intended to restrict publication of the issues in the
    case except in so far as is necessary to comply with the order.

 2. The respondent to this appeal, hereinafter "the claimant", is a citizen
    of Bangladesh who was born on 21 January 1991 and so is  now  24  years
    old.  He appealed successfully to the First-tier Tribunal a decision of
    the appellant, hereinafter "the Secretary of State", to  make  him  the
    subject of a deportation order on 2 April 2014.  The Secretary of State
    was given permission  to  appeal  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision
    because it was thought arguable that the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in
    its approach in assessing whether it was unduly  harsh  to  expect  the
    claimant to return to  Bangladesh  and  that  the  Tribunal  had  given
    insufficient weight to the public interest in  conducting  a  balancing
    exercise for the purposes of assessing the impact of Article 8  of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal's determination is short.   Indeed  it  is  not
    very  much  longer,  if  at  all,  than  the  grounds  supporting   the
    application for permission to appeal but brevity is a  virtue  provided
    it is sufficient. I consider now exactly what the  First-tier  Tribunal
    said in its determination.

 4. The Secretary of State's decision that was subject to appeal  was  made
    on 2 April 2014.  The Tribunal outlined  the  "legal  framework".   The
    Tribunal reminded itself, correctly, that where a foreign national  had
    been sentenced to a single term of at least twelve months' imprisonment
    the Secretary of State "must make a  deportation  order"  and  that  in
    those circumstances deportation is conducive to the public good.

 5. The Tribunal then picked its  way  meticulously  through  the  relevant
    statute and Rules and also reminded  itself  that  Section  55  of  the
    Borders, Nationality and Immigration  Act  2009  applied  so  the  best
    interests of the appellant's children are a "primary consideration".

 6. The passages headed "background" are particularly apposite  and  I  set
    them out in full below:

         "12. The [claimant's] history is set out in  the  decision  letter,
         there is no  dispute  about  the  chronology  a  summary  of  which
         follows.  Born on 21 January 1991 and a national of  Bangladesh  he
         claimed to have entered the UK in August  2000  but  there  was  no
         record of this.  He applied for ILR in June 2010  but  was  granted
         LTR on 2 November 2013.  He met his partner,  who  is  British,  in
         2011 and they went through an Islamic marriage ceremony, but not  a
         legal ceremony, on 31 January 2012.  They  had  a  daughter  on  22
         October 2012 and their son was born on 22 August 2013 by which time
         the [claimant] was serving a prison sentence.

         13.  On 3 June 2013 the [claimant] pleaded guilty to  two  offences
         of sexual assault, on the more serious charge he was  sentenced  to
         eighteen months' imprisonment and on the other charge  he  received
         six months' imprisonment to run concurrently.   The  first  offence
         was committed on 11 February 2011 but he was not arrested for  that
         until after the second offence was committed on  24  January  2013.
         It is clear from the sentencing remarks that the [claimant] pleaded
         guilty only on the day set down for trial.

         14.  There are no offences recorded  against  the  [claimant]  that
         predate his first offence or since his release from prison.   Dated
         1 April 2014 there is an OASys Assessment that gives  his  risk  of
         serious harm to the public in the community as medium and he  is  a
         low risk to children.  A medium risk  is  defined  as  there  being
         identifiable indicators or risk of serious harm  and  the  offender
         has the potential to cause serious harm but is unlikely  to  do  so
         unless there is a change in his circumstances."

 7. The Tribunal found that the claimant was living with  his  partner  and
    their children in their family home.  It appeared that there was a good
    relationship between the claimant and his children.  The  claimant  had
    lived in the United Kingdom since he was aged 7 and would only see  his
    children if they went with him.  The Tribunal noted that  the  claimant
    spoke English fluently and accepted he had only returned to  Bangladesh
    on one occasion but did not remain there for long.

 8. The Tribunal found that the claimant went through an  Islamic  marriage
    ceremony at a  time  when  his  immigration  status  was  "precarious".
    Paragraph  399(b)  of  HC  395  did  not  apply  when  considering  the
    claimant's relationship with his partner.   Nevertheless  the  claimant
    was  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental  relationship  with  his
    children, who were British citizens, and the Tribunal had to decide  if
    it would be unduly harsh for the child to  live  in  Bangladesh  or  to
    remain in the United Kingdom without the claimant.

 9. Paragraph 17 of the determination includes important findings about the
    claimant's family circumstances and again I set it out in full:

         "The [claimant's] partner's circumstances are unusual and  a  cause
         of some difficulties for them.  She is estranged  from  her  family
         having left the family home under police  protection  to  avoid  an
         unwanted arranged marriage  to  her  first  cousin  in  Bangladesh.
         There is an injunction against her mother and she  has  no  contact
         with any members of her family.  It is her case that she cannot  go
         to Bangladesh as she would be in danger from her first cousin there
         and would be unable to integrate having lived her whole life in the
         UK and not speaking any other language."

10. At paragraphs 24 and 25 of the determination the  Tribunal  found  that
    the situation of the claimant's  partner  and  their  children  was  "a
    matter of concern".  She was "positively estranged from her family  and
    at risk to the extent that she left under police protection and has  an
    injunction against her mother".  It  was  also  found  that  there  was
    "limited contact" with the claimant's aunt  and  uncle  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  There is reference to them having  one  brief  meeting.   The
    Tribunal said at paragraph 25:

         "The deportation of the [claimant] would deprive the  children  and
         his partner of his support and the protection that he could provide
         against further family interference.  There is a  risk  of  contact
         through community channels between the [claimant's] aunt and  uncle
         and his partner's family although we accept that is speculative and
         there is no evidence that problems have arisen through  that  route
         yet."

11. The Tribunal reminded itself that Bangladesh is a "large  country"  and
    was clearly not impressed with the argument that the claimant's partner
    would be at risk because of her first cousin or members of  his  family
    who had been slighted by her refusal to marry him but  also  noted  the
    claimant's partner's would not live  in  Bangladesh  and  concluded  it
    would be "unduly harsh" to expect the family to live with the  claimant
    in Bangladesh.  The Tribunal also found that it would be "unduly  harsh
    and could not be justified under the Rules" for the claimant's children
    to live without him.

12. The Tribunal clearly did not find this an easy case and  said  that  it
    was "not straightforward by any  means"  before  it  decided  that,  on
    balance, it was right to allow the appeal.

13. Before I consider the Secretary of State's grounds I remind myself that
    the "litmus  test"  for  determining  if  a  decision  is  sufficiently
    reasoned is if the original judge's thought processes can be understood
    (see, for example, R (Iran) & Ors v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2005] EWCA Civ 982).

14. As far as I am concerned, and with appropriate respect to  Ms  Savage's
    measured and firm submissions, this question is clearly answered in the
    affirmative.  The Tribunal was persuaded, not without hesitation,  that
    it was unduly harsh to the claimant's children, now aged about  2�  and
    about 20 months, to be brought up in the United Kingdom solely by their
    mother, who was socially  isolated  without  any  community  or  family
    support and whose circumstances had already attracted the attention  of
    the claimant's probation officer even though their circumstances  would
    be on the very peripheries of, if not outside, the probation  officer's
    sphere of work.

15. In my experience appeals involving deportation are almost never allowed
    because of the impact of removal on the offender.  When they succeed it
    is because the Tribunal has decided that the offender's  removal  would
    impact too harshly on someone else, usually a life partner or a  child.
    Although I certainly did not reach my conclusion until considering  the
    case as a whole I make plain now that I am satisfied  that  this  is  a
    case where, far from being wrong in law, the Tribunal has done its  job
    and I will not interfere with their decision.

16. I consider first ground 2 of the Secretary of State's grounds because I
    regard this as the least satisfactory of  the  grounds  before  me.   I
    reject  emphatically  the  contention  that  the  Tribunal  failed   to
    appreciate  that  the  public  interest  lay  in  deporting  a  foreign
    criminal.  The contrary is plainly the  case.   The  Tribunal  directed
    itself expressly that the  public  interest  lies  in  the  removal  or
    deporting a foreign criminal.  This is expressed in the  Rules  and  in
    statute and was clearly in the Tribunal's mind.  The Tribunal  did  not
    indulge  in  a  display  of  judicial  handwringing  setting  out   the
    circumstances of the claimant's offending and saying how appalling  the
    offences were but it is absurd to suggest that  the  Tribunal  was  not
    aware of the offences.  They are identified as "two offences of  sexual
    assault" at paragraph 13 and the sentencing remarks of the  judge  were
    clearly in the mind of the Tribunal albeit not mentioned in  a  context
    that deals with the severity of the offence rather then the lateness of
    the plea.  The finding about the risk of  future  offending  was  based
    closely on the OASys assessment and was recognised as a  "medium  risk"
    which means that the claimant  is  thought  to  be  unlikely  to  cause
    serious harm unless there is a change in his circumstances.  It is  the
    Secretary  of  State  that  is  trying   to   change   the   claimant's
    circumstances, not the claimant.

17. It is right that  the  Tribunal  did  not  expressly  acknowledge  that
    deportation reflects public revulsion but, as it  had  found  that  the
    claimant was unlikely to re-offend even though it recognised  that  the
    public interest was in favour of deportation, I really see no basis  at
    all for suggesting that the Tribunal gave improper weight to the public
    interest requiring the claimant's deportation.

18. Mr Blundell drew my attention to the decision of Masih  (deportation  -
    public interest - basic principles) Pakistan [2012]  UKUT  00046  (IAC)
    where at paragraph 11 the Tribunal set out the basic principles in "the
    public interest side of the balancing exercise"  with  the  observation
    that there was no need for divisions of the Tribunal  to  make  further
    reference to them.  This point is echoed in the decision of  the  Court
    of Appeal in AK (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
    [2014] 1642 where Longmore LJ at paragraph 13 emphasised that the Rules
    are a code and contain all  that  needs  to  be  said  and  it  is  not
    generally desirable to make reference to the old law.

19. I decline to say that the Tribunal would have been wrong to have  given
    more details about the offences and the need for deportation.   I  note
    that paragraph 117C(2) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
    2002 says  "the  more  serious  the  offence  committed  by  a  foreign
    criminal, the greater is the public  interest  in  deportation  of  the
    criminal". Determining the level of seriousness of  an  offence  is  an
    imprecise act but the degree of  punishment  it  attracted  must  be  a
    telling factor and might sometimes require express  consideration.  For
    example, sometimes a sentence is much less than  might  at  first  seem
    appropriate and that might prompt  the  Tribunal  to  consider  if  the
    offence is a serious as  it  sounds.  Here  the  Tribunal  clearly  and
    rightly recognised that this was a case punished by  between  one  year
    and  four  years'  imprisonment  where  the  public  interest  required
    deportation unless certain circumstances applied.

20. Ground 1 of the Secretary of  State's  grounds  makes  two  intertwined
    points.  To the extent that it  contends  the  Tribunal  did  not  have
    proper regard to the public interest then for the reasons given above I
    disagree.   In  my  judgment  that  is  a  contention  that  cannot  be
    sustained.

21. The  grounds  also  contend  that  there  was  "no  evidence  that  the
    [claimant's] partner or children were unable to cope in his absence  or
    that the children were affected in any way while  he  was  in  prison".
    That is not right.  The evidence was that the claimant's partner  found
    it difficult,  which  is  why  the  claimant's  probation  officer  got
    involved.  There is no basis for  criticising  the  Tribunal's  finding
    that this claimant's partner has to manage  on  her  own  and  that  is
    difficult.  Anyone with any experience whatsoever of managing  children
    of this age would not need very much evidence that a woman entirely  on
    her own would find it difficult.

22. Point 4 of ground 1 complains that the Tribunal used the nationality of
    the claimant's children as a "trump card" and it is not unduly harsh to
    expect the claimant's immediate family  members  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom.  I agree with Mr Blundell that this  ground  was  based  on  a
    misreading of the decision in LC (China) [2014] EWCA Civ  1310.   There
    the Court of Appeal was concerned with a case where the person had been
    sent  to  four  years'  imprisonment  or  more  and   therefore   where
    "exceptional circumstances"  were  needed  before  public  interest  in
    removal could be outweighed by other factors.  The  instant  appeal  is
    not an "exceptional circumstances" case and the ruling in LC (China) is
    not particularly illuminating in this  appeal.  The  Tribunal  did  not
    regard the nationality of the children as a trump card. It was  clearly
    more concerned  with  the  fact  that  the  claimant's  mother  had  no
    experience of living in Bangladesh and indeed had set  her  heart  very
    firmly against living in Bangladesh.  She was plainly frightened to  go
    there because she cherished the  belief  that  she  would  be  found  a
    victim.  That might be an unfounded belief but additionally,  she  told
    the Tribunal that she  spoke  only  a  smattering  of  any  Bangladeshi
    language.  It would be extremely difficult for  her  to  cope  in  that
    country and although the finding that it was unduly harsh to expect the
    children to establish themselves in Bangladesh  might  be  thought  the
    weakest part  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  reasoning  I  am  wholly
    unpersuaded that it is a decision that was neither open to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal nor explained insufficiently in the determination.

23. The Tribunal made it very plain that this case was very  fact-specific.
    It referred at paragraph 27 to the "almost unique circumstances".

24. The Tribunal did have evidence that the claimant was facing up  to  his
    criminality and resolving not to re-offend.  That  came  from  his  own
    mouth and although such evidence can rarely be given a  great  deal  of
    weight on its own it was there and there was no reason why the Tribunal
    should reject it.

25. With respect to the First-tier Tribunal its decision was tightly  drawn
    and had to be read carefully to be understood properly.   This  is  not
    because the decision was careless and the reasons  disguised.   On  the
    contrary, the determination had been  considered  carefully  and  every
    word was there for a reason.  It is plain to me that this is a decision
    in accordance with the law that is reasoned adequately  and  is  within
    the range of decisions that the Tribunal could have reached rationally.

26. It follows therefore that I dismiss the Secretary of State's appeal and
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
