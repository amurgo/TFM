                                     And

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellants:    No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer
                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

 1. The appellants, citizens of Afghanistan,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against decisions of the Secretary of State  dated  5  January
    2015 to refuse their applications for asylum and to  remove  them  from
    the UK. First-tier Tribunal Judge Lodge dismissed the appeals  and  the
    appellants were granted permission to appeal to this Tribunal.

 2. When the appeal came before me there was no appearance by or on  behalf
    of the appellants. Following receipt of  the  notices  of  hearing  the
    appellant's former representatives had written to the Upper Tribunal on
    28 January 2016 to say that they  were  no  longer  instructed  by  the
    appellants. I was satisfied that notices of hearing had  been  sent  to
    the  appellants  at  the  address  notified  to  the  Tribunal  in  the
    applications for permission to appeal.

 3. Mr Whitwell informed me that the Home Office system records that on  26
    October 2015 the Secretary of State was advised that the appellant  and
    his family left the UK on 13 October 2015 on a flight  to  Los  Angeles
    having obtained settlement in the USA.

 4. In light of these circumstances I  consider it appropriate to treat the
    appellants'  appeals  as  abandoned  under   section   92(8)   of   the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as amended  and  I  hereby
    give notice that the appeals are being so treated under rule 17A(2)  of
    the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

 5. There are therefore no  appeals  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.


Signed
                       Date: 10 February 2016

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal
