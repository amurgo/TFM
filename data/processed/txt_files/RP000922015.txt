Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  MA  is  granted
anonymity.  No report of these  proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly
identify him or any member of their family.  This direction applies both  to
the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure to comply with this  direction
could lead to contempt of court proceedings.





                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This decision re-makes MA's appeal on Article 3 ECHR grounds,  made  in
    the context of deportation proceedings. It follows a  decision  of  the
    Upper Tribunal dated 1 May 2019 which set aside a  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision which found that MA was from the minority Gaboye clan and that
    he would face a breach of his rights under Article 3  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if returned to Somalia.

 2. For ease of reference, in this decision we refer to  the  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department as  the  respondent  and  to  MA  as  the
    appellant, reflecting their positions before the First-tier Tribunal.

Background

 3. The appellant's background is set out in  full  in  the  error  of  law
    decision but it is expedient to set out the key parts again here.

 4. MA is a citizen of Somalia, born in 1975.  He came to the  UK  in  1989
    with his family.  He was granted refugee  status  on  4  November  1990
    until 4 November 1994.  He was granted indefinite leave to remain (ILR)
    on 15 July 1995.

 5. The appellant went on  to  amass  an  extensive  and  serious  criminal
    record.  For the purposes of this  decision  it  is  not  necessary  to
    rehearse all of his convictions but the following offences are notable.



 6. In 1995 the appellant was convicted of robbery for which he received  a
    sentence of 3 years in a Youth Offenders' Institute and was recommended
    for deportation.

 7. In 2001 the appellant was convicted  of  Class  A  drugs  offences  and
    sentenced to 42 months' imprisonment.

 8. On 7 February 2011 he was convicted of further Class A  drugs  offences
    and sentenced to 54 months in prison.

 9. The respondent wrote to the appellant on 23 March 2011 notifying him of
    an intention to deport him and requesting that he provide  reasons  why
    he should not be deported.

10. Notwithstanding that notification, on 18 November  2013  the  appellant
    was again convicted of Class A  drugs  offences  and  sentenced  to  40
    months' imprisonment.

11. Unsurprisingly, on 29 September 2015, the respondent made a deportation
    order against the appellant under s.32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007.

12. Further, in a decision dated 1 October  2015  the  appellant's  refugee
    status was revoked.  The  respondent  also  made  a  certificate  under
    Section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  against
    the appellant as it was considered that he  had  been  convicted  of  a
    particularly serious crime and that he  constituted  a  danger  to  the
    community of the UK.

13. The decision of 1 October  2015  also  refused  the  appellant's  human
    rights claims, finding that Articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR would  not  be
    breached if the appellant was deported.

14. The appellant appealed the decisions of  1  October  2015,  maintaining
    that he was a refugee, that he qualified for  humanitarian  protection,
    that the s. 72 certificate was not lawfully made and that  his  removal
    would amount to a breach of Articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR.

15. The appeal was first heard by First-tier Tribunal Andrew on  16  August
    2016. In a decision issued on 22 August 2016, Judge Andrew  found  that
    the s.72 certificate was lawful and that, therefore, the appellant  was
    excluded from the benefit of the Refugee  Convention  and  humanitarian
    protection. She went on to dismiss the Article 3 and Article 8 appeals.



16. The appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal. In a decision  issued  on
    30 October 2016, Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek found an error  of  law
    and set aside the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Andrew.  The
    appeal was remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be re-made. Paragraph
    31 of the error of law decision made it clear that the re-making of the
    appeal was limited to findings on the appellant's clan  membership  and
    an assessment of whether  his  circumstances  on  return  to  Mogadishu
    amounted to a breach of Article 3 ECHR.

17. The appeal then came  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Bird  on  21
    January 2019. In her decision issued on 13  February  2019,  she  found
    that the appellant was from the  minority  Gaboye  clan  and  that  his
    circumstances on return to  Mogadishu  would  amount  to  a  breach  of
    Article 3 ECHR.

18. The respondent appealed to the Upper Tribunal against the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Bird. In a decision dated 1  May  2019,  the  Upper
    Tribunal found that the First-tier  Tribunal  had  erred  in  law  when
    finding that the appellant was from the  Gaboye  clan.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal findings on that issue relied heavily on  the  evidence  of  a
    journalist, Ms Mary Harper. The First-tier Tribunal failed to assess Ms
    Harper's evidence against the criticism of her in the Country  Guidance
    case of MOJ and Others (return to Mogadishu)  Somalia  CG  [2014]  UKUT
    00442 (IAC) and in the reported case of AAW (expert evidence -  weight)
    Somalia [2015] UKUT 00673 (IAC).

19. The Upper Tribunal also found an error  of  law  where  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had not applied the correct, stringent test for an  Article  3
    ECHR claim based on destitution, identified in the cases of SSHD v Said
    [2016] EWCA Civ 442 and SSHD v MA (Somalia) [2018] EWCA Civ 994.

20. It is of note that the  appellant  did  not  appear  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Bird on 21 January 2019 or the Upper Tribunal at the error  of
    law hearing on 16 April 2019. He was represented at those  hearings  by
    Counsel, instructed by Birnberg Peirce Solicitors.

21. On 22 July 2019, Birnberg Peirce Solicitors wrote to the Upper Tribunal
    stating that they no longer acted for  MA  and  that  no-one  would  be
    attending to represent him at the re-making hearing listed for 23  July
    2019.

22. Once again, MA did not attend the hearing of  his  appeal  on  23  July
    2019.  Notice of hearing had been  sent  to  the  address  for  service
    provided by him, there was no application for  an  adjournment  and  no
    explanation for his absence. The Tribunal concluded that it was in  the
    interests of justice to proceed in his absence having applied  Rule  38
    of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008.  The  Tribunal
    heard oral submissions from Mr Jarvis and reserved its decision.

    Clan Membership

23. The first question that remains to be answered concerns the appellant's
    claim to be from the Gaboye clan.

24. In his undated witness  statement,  at  pages  1-6  of  Tab  C  of  the
    appellant's bundle, in paragraph 1, the appellant stated  that  he  was
    born in Shabelle in Southern Somalia.

25. In paragraph 2 of the witness statement, the appellant maintained  that
    his father was from the Gaboye clan and that his mother  was  from  the
    Ogaden clan. He considered that he derived his clan membership from his
    father and so was from the Gaboye clan. He submitted that he would face
    persecution and discrimination on return to Somalia as a member of  the
    Gaboye clan.

26. The appellant went  on  to  explain  in  paragraph  3  of  his  witness
    statement that he was aware that when his mother claimed asylum she had
    stated that the appellant was born in Hargeisa, Somaliland. Although he
    knew this was not correct he had continued to state that he was born in
    Hargeisa in order to remain consistent with what his mother  had  said.
    Nevertheless, his true place of birth was Shabelle in Southern Somalia.



27. In paragraphs 5 to 11 of his statement, the appellant  maintained  that
    the family left Hargeisa and went to Mogadishu. His  father  worked  in
    Saudi Arabia for the regime of  President  Siad  Barre.  The  appellant
    joined his parents in Saudi Arabia in 1984. He came to the UK with  his
    parents in 1989 and was a dependent on his mother's  asylum  claim.  At
    some point his father returned to Somalia. The appellant and his family
    were informed in 1991 that his father had been executed because of  his
    association with the Siad Barre regime.

28. The respondent disputed the appellant's claim to  be  from  the  Gaboye
    clan. The respondent pointed  out  that  when  the  appellant's  mother
    claimed  asylum  in  1989  with  the  appellant  as  a  dependent,  she
    maintained that she was from the major Ogaden clan and stated that  the
    family had come to the UK from Hargeisa in Somaliland. It was only when
    the appellant put forward an independent asylum claim after  he  became
    aware of the respondent's intention to deport  him  in  2013,  that  he
    maintained that he was  from  the  minority  Gaboye  clan,  though  his
    father, and that he was born in Hargeisa and  had  moved  to  Mogadishu
    before coming to the UK.

29. The respondent's decision of 1 October 2015  addressed  this  issue  in
    paragraph 58:

         "Consideration has been given to the claim that you were  not  born
         in Hargeisa but in Shabeela in southern Somalia.   It  is  accepted
         that in a completed notice of liability  to  automatic  deportation
         letter questionnaire of June 2014 you  stated  that  you  and  your
         father were born in Shabeela, although you have  not  provided  any
         evidence to  support  this  claim.   However,  on  Travel  Document
         application forms dated December 1997  and  15  February  1999  you
         stated that you were born in Hargeisa, Somalia.   On  you  mother's
         file is a statement made by her that the family  fled  Hargeisa  in
         mid-1988.   It  is  also  noted  that   in   an   application   for
         naturalisation as a British citizen, dated 8  November  1998,  your
         mother provided her place of birth and those of  your  siblings  as
         Hargeisa.  While it is unclear why you would supply  two  different
         locations as your place  of  birth,  it  is  considered  that  your
         earlier statements and those of your mother indicate that you  were
         born in Hargeisa."

30. The appellant seeks to rely on a report dated 25 May 2018  prepared  by
    Ms Mary Harper. Her instructions, set out on  pages  1  and  2  of  the
    report, were to address the issue of the  appellant's  clan  membership
    and the treatment of the Gaboye in Somalia  and  describe  whether  any
    other aspect of the appellant's profile, for example  being  away  from
    Somalia for many years, could lead to ill-treatment or discrimination.

31. As found in the error of law decision dated 1 May 2019,  our  view  was
    that Ms Harper's report had to be approached with caution.  Significant
    parts of her evidence were not found not to be reliable in the  Country
    Guidance case of MOJ and Others (return to Mogadishu) Somalia CG [2014]
    UKUT 00442 (IAC). Also, in the reported case of AAW (expert evidence  -
    weight) Somalia [2015] UKUT 00673 (IAC) there is detailed criticism  of
    the report Ms Harper provided in that appeal as  it  continued  to  put
    forward the same evidence that was found unreliable in MOJ.  The  Upper
    Tribunal in AAW also found that Ms Harper's  report  failed  to  follow
    material aspects of the Senior President's  Practice  Direction  No  10
    (2010) which sets out a series of duties for expert witnesses.

32. We noted that in paragraphs 3.5 to 3.8 of the report prepared for  this
    appeal, Ms Harper identified that not all of her evidence  in  MOJ  was
    accepted and indicated  that  she  had  "reflected  on  the  Tribunal's
    reasoning and endeavoured to take it on board when  providing  opinions
    in this case". In paragraph 3.6 Ms Harper also identified that she  had
    "considered and engaged with" the findings in AAW. She  also  indicated
    in paragraph 3.8 that she had had particular  regard  to  the  relevant
    Senior President's Practice Direction on expert evidence as  summarised
    in MOJ in paragraph 25 and referred to in AAW in paragraph 24.

33. It was not our conclusion that the body of the report  reflected  those
    self-directions in substance, however. We found  numerous  examples  of
    the shortcomings in Ms Harper's evidence  identified  in  MOJ  and  AAW
    being repeated in the report prepared for this appeal.

34. One example is that the head note of MOJ at (viii)  states  that  there
    "are no clan militias in Mogadishu, no clan violence, and no clan based
    discriminatory treatment, even for minority clan members." Ms  Harper's
    report at paragraphs 7.2 to  8.2,  however,  maintains  that  there  is
    significant discrimination and risk of violence on the basis  of  being
    from the Gaboye clan. Nowhere in Ms Harper's current  report,  on  this
    issue or any other, is there an attempt to identify  the  "very  strong
    grounds supported by  cogent  evidence"  required  for  findings  in  a
    Country Guidance case to be considered no longer authoritative and  set
    aside or replaced;  SG  (Iraq)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2012] EWCA Civ 940 applied.

35. Further, at paragraph 9.4 of the report, Ms Harper maintains  that  the
    length of time that the appellant has been absent from Mogadishu:

         "... would cause him immense difficulty on return as  he  would  be
         completely unfamiliar with his surroundings and would not know  how
         to behave during periods of violence and insecurity."

    Ms Harper put forward the same evidence in MOJ and it was  rejected  by
    the Upper Tribunal in paragraph 197:


         "Once again,  we  find  it  impossible  to  accept  that  a  person
         returning to Mogadishu today after a period  of  absence  would  be
         sufficiently ill-informed as to not  instinctively appreciate  that
         these are examples of  behaviour  to  be  avoided,  whether  anyone
         locally "in the know" informed them of that or not."

36. Ms Harper suggests in paragraph 9.5  of  her  report  that  the  Somali
    security forces would be  a  threat  to  the  appellant's  security  on
    return. This is contrary to the  findings  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    paragraph 178 of MOJ in which the Tribunal identified  reliable  source
    material showing that abuses by  security  forces  "have  decreased  in
    recent times."

37. Also in paragraph 9.5 of her report, Ms Harper comments that  civilians
    are  being  disproportionately  affected  by  security   incidents   in
    Mogadishu. This part of her evidence was rejected by the Upper Tribunal
    in paragraph 166 of MOJ:

         "However, what has not been mentioned, either by Ms  Harper  or  in
         the UNHCR report is that the view that civilians were  bearing  the
         brunt of the Al Shabaab attacks in Mogadishu was put by the  author
         of this memo to the High Court  in  the  Hague,  supported  by  the
         statistical evidence assembled, but was rejected by the court which
         went on to uphold the deportation order being challenged. Thus what
         is now relied upon has failed to survive judicial scrutiny and  the
         data itself offered in support is not made available to us,  either
         in the memo or the UNHCR report."

38. In paragraph 9.6 of the report, Ms Harper  contends  that  "individuals
    with  a  criminal  past  are  likely  to  face  increased  difficulties
    including being stigmatised by others and problems finding  work."  Her
    evidence to the same effect was rejected by the Upper Tribunal  in  MOJ
    at paragraph 200:

         "... this is yet another example of an opinion being  offered  that
         is simply unsupported by any actual evidence of it occurring, being
         based instead upon what the witness believes would be the case."

    Also, in AAW, the Upper Tribunal found in paragraph 64(b):

         "b. While it may become known that the appellant has  been  removed
         to Mogadishu on account of a deportation order following conviction
         for a serious criminal offence, the evidence does not establish any
         real risk to returnees on such account. There is no reason  why  an
         earlier conviction for sexual assault would become  known  and  the
         appellant has identified no reason to suppose anyone who  would  be
         able to do so would now wish to make that known and, in any  event,
         the evidence simply does not establish that  persons  convicted  of
         offences that might be thought to offend social mores  do  in  fact
         face a real risk of Article 3 ill-treatment, even  if  that  matter
         may have been left open by the Tribunal in MOJ and Ors;"

39. In paragraph 9.7 of her report, Ms Harper  refers  to  interviews  with
    security officials, NGO workers and others as support for her view that
    returned criminals are at risk  on  return  to  Somalia  but  fails  to
    provide any transcripts. As noted by the Upper  Tribunal  in  AAW,  the
    failure to provide the source material means that little or  no  weight
    can be placed on this evidence.

40. As a result, we were in agreement with the Upper Tribunal in  paragraph
    46 of AAW that:

         "Her report lacks the objectivity demanded and her  review  of  the
         country information available is  selective.  Where  she  expresses
         opinions that conflict with current country guidance, she offers no
         basis upon which her own opinions should properly  be  accepted  to
         prevail.  Therefore,  this  evidence  stands  as  the  view  of  an
         experienced journalist with personal experience of  the  city  from
         her regular visits.  It is not to be disregarded, but considered in
         the round with all of the other evidence available and in the light
         of current country guidance."

41. In light of that conclusion, we also found that  we  must  approach  Ms
    Harper's comments on  the  appellant's  clan  membership  with  similar
    caution. Even were that not so, we did not find that Ms Harper's report
    even  at  its  highest  provided  a  great  deal  of  support  for  the
    appellant's claim to be from the Gaboye  clan.  In  paragraph  5.3,  Ms
    Harper states that "[MA]'s  description  of  his  life  in  Somalia  is
    sketchy and vague." She goes on to qualify this statement, stating that
    this is "not entirely surprising" as he left Somalia aged 9 years  old.
    Our reading of this part of the report is that the applicant's evidence
    on his claim to have spent his early life in Somalia is not strong  but
    there is a  partial  explanation  for  this.  However,  the  consistent
    evidence of the appellant and his mother in various applications  prior
    to the appellant facing deportation proceedings was that the  appellant
    had  spent  most  of  his  life  prior  to  coming   to   the   UK   in
    Hargeisa/Somaliland and not in Mogadishu/Somalia. In that  context,  we
    found that his limited evidence on his time in  Somalia  supported  the
    earlier claim to be from Somaliland  and  to  be  of  Ogaden  ethnicity
    rather than being a member of the Gaboye clan from Somalia.

42. We  found  that  the  applicant's  claim  regarding  his  ethnicity  is
    undermined further comments made by Ms Harper in paragraph 5.3  of  her
    report:

             "I find it surprising that [MA]'s mother is a  member  of  the
             Ogaden clan  while  his  father's  status  is  claimed  to  be
             Midgan/Gaboye. The Midgan/Gaboye are a  particularly  despised
             minority group and it is not usual for them to  marry  members
             of majority clans such as the Ogaden."

43. Ms Harper comments in paragraph 5.4 that she did not find it surprising
    that the family lied about their origins and said that they  came  from
    Somaliland when they came to the  UK  in  1989  as  there  was  intense
    violence there at the  time.  In  our  view,  an  acceptance  that  the
    appellant (and his  mother)  were  dishonest  about  their  history  in
    previous applications does not assist the appellant now in his claim to
    be Gaboye. It shows him to be an unreliable witness and undermines  his
    current claim to be from the Gaboye clan.

44. Ms Harper confirms in paragraph 5.5 of  her  report  that  Gaboye  clan
    members were employed by the Siad  Barre  regime  and  suffered  severe
    reprisals when the regime was overthrown in 1991. We accept  that  this
    is consistent with the appellant's assertions in his most recent  claim
    that his father was associated with the Barre regime and was killed  as
    a result. Against the evidence on this issue as a  whole,  we  did  not
    find that this consistency could be determinative  of  the  appellant's
    claim to be Gaboye, however.

45. In paragraph 6.2 Ms  Harper  finds  the  appellant's  evidence  of  the
    discrimination  he  experienced  as  a  Gaboye  was  detailed  and,  in
    paragraph 6.4, that this was consistent  with  what  she  knew  of  the
    discrimination experienced  by  Gaboye  and  other  minority  clans  in
    Somalia. We did not find this part of the report  and  the  appellant's
    evidence could be determinative given that the historical  mistreatment
    of minority clans is relatively well known  and  available  to  someone
    growing up in a Somali community, even in the UK.

46. In paragraph 6.4, Ms Harper again comments on the difficulty  with  the
    appellant's claim to be of mixed Gaboye/Ogaden ethnicity:

         "The one aspect that continues to confuse me is the  majority  clan
         status of [MA]'s mother, as members of majority  clans  usually  do
         not marry members of occupational "caste" groups in  Somalia,  such
         as the Midgan/Gaboye, who are considered  exceptionally  lowly.  As
         stated by Ms Luling. "Midgaan could not intermarry with members  of
         the 'noble' Somali clan (sic). This rule is less strictly  observed
         in modern times, but all the same there are known cases of  couples
         who tried to do so being lynched."

47. Having considered Ms  Harper's  evidence  together  with  that  of  the
    appellant, we do not find that he has shown that it is likely  that  he
    is from the Gaboye clan though his father.  Taking Ms Harper's view  of
    his ethnicity at its highest, she is  equivocal  and  finds  the  claim
    regarding his parents' marriage to be  very  unusual.  The  appellant's
    mother consistently put forward the family as  being  Ogaden  and  from
    Hargeisa, not half-Gaboye and from Shabelle. The appellant adopted  his
    mother's account until faced with deportation in 2014.  Our  conclusion
    is that the overwhelming likelihood is that the appellant is  not  from
    the Gaboye clan but is from the majority Ogaden clan,  as  he  and  his
    mother put forward in their previous dealings with the respondent.

    Article 3

48. The Court of Appeal has confirmed  recently  in  SSHD  v  MS  (Somalia)
    [2019] EWCA Civ 1345 that the test for a breach of Article  3  ECHR  on
    the basis of destitution is not synonymous with the factors  identified
    in paragraph 407h of MOJ being met. The  Court  approved  the  guidance
    provided in paragraph 28 of SSHD v Said [2016] EWCA Civ 442, commenting
    on the factors identified in MOJ as relevant to return as follows:

         "Whilst they may have some relevance in  a  search  for  whether  a
         removal to Somalia would give rise to a violation of article  3  of
         the Convention, they cannot be understood as  a  surrogate  for  an
         examination of the circumstances to determine whether such a breach
         would occur. I am unable to accept that if a Somali  national  were
         able to bring himself within the rubric of para 408  [of  MOJ],  he
         would have established that his removal  to  Somalia  would  breach
         article 3 of the Convention. Such an approach would be inconsistent
         with the domestic and Convention jurisprudence  which  at  para  34
         UTIAC expressly understood itself to be following."

49. As identified in paragraph 18 of Said,

         "These cases demonstrate that to succeed in  resisting  removal  on
         article 3 grounds on the basis of suggested poverty or  deprivation
         on return which are not the responsibility of the receiving country
         or others in the sense described in para  282  of  Sufi  and  Elmi,
         whether or not the  feared  deprivation  is  contributed  to  by  a
         medical condition, the  person  liable  to  deportation  must  show
         circumstances which bring him within the approach of the Strasbourg
         Court in the D and N cases. "

    The cases referred to in the final sentence  are  D  v  United  Kingdom
    [1997] 2004 EHRR 423 and N v United Kingdom 47 EHRR 885  which  require
    exceptional or very compelling circumstances for a finding of a  breach
    of Article 3 ECHR.

50. It is our conclusion that the appellant cannot show the required  level
    of exceptionality or very compelling circumstances if he is returned to
    Somalia. He is from the majority Ogaden clan. He maintains that he  has
    no family in Somalia. We accept that he left at a young age and that he
    and his family have been outside the country for many years but that in
    itself does not mean that he and  his  family  lost  contact  with  all
    relatives who remained. We say this, having regard to the fact that  he
    has not attended to be cross-examined on this or any other part of  his
    evidence and in the context of the lack of credibility in his claim  to
    be Gaboye and his own acceptance that he was dishonest previously  when
    applying for travel documents.

51. Even  if  the  appellant  has  no  relatives  in  Mogadishu,  following
    paragraphs (vii) and (viii) of the headnote of MOJ, he can  still  look
    for support from Ogaden or Darod clan members. A USAID report from 2013
    identifies that "the Darood represent the third largest ethnic minority
    clan population in Mogadishu".

52. We accept that the appellant left Somalia at the age of 9 and that now,
    at the age of 44, he will face a significant readjustment on return. As
    above, he can expect Ogaden or  Darod  clan  members  to  provide  some
    support. He is a  healthy,  still  relatively  young  man  who  can  be
    expected to work.

53. We accept that the appellant is unlikely to be  sent  remittances  from
    his family in the UK given his estrangement from them as  a  result  of
    his  serious  criminal  offending.  In  paragraph  10  of  his  witness
    statement he refers to having found casual work in the UK, however, and
    so it is reasonable to expect him to look for such work in Somalia.

54. Further, the appellant is entitled  to  a  Facilitated  Returns  Scheme
    (FRS) payment of �500 on a  pre-paid  cash  card  before  returning  to
    Somalia and to a further payment of �250 via the IOM after returning. A
    LANDINFO report dated 1 April 2016 indicated on pages 14 to 15 that:


         "The cost of living in Mogadishu,  as  in  all  other  big  cities,
         varies depending on where one lives, material standard  of  living,
         and where purchases are made. Another question to ask is how much a
         person needs to survive in Mogadishu, or what is needed to  live  a
         decent or good enough life in Mogadishu? There are no studies  that
         provide a clear and unambiguous  answer  to  the  above  questions.
         However, the  questions  were  asked  during  Landinfo's  visit  to
         Mogadishu in January 2016: The IOM representative believed that USD
         400 a month would be sufficient to maintain a  family  of  four  in
         terms of food and rent, but not enough  to  also  cover  children's
         school fees or any expenses for healthcare. The source was also  of
         the opinion that 20 % of Mogadishu's population live a  good  life,
         40 % are doing tolerably well and 40 % are poor. He believed that a
         family of four with USD 400 available belongs to the category  that
         is doing tolerably well."


55. Where the appellant can obtain some support from members of  his  clan,
    can be expected to seek casual  work  and  would  have  at  least  �500
    available on return, a sum more than sufficient to support a family  of
    four for a month, we did not find that he could be found to face a real
    risk of destitution on return.


56. It was therefore our conclusion that the appellant  could  not  show  a
    real risk of inhuman or degrading treatment mistreatment on  return  to
    Somalia and that he had not made out a claim under Article 3 ECHR.

Decision

57. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal disclosed an error of  law  and
    was set aside to be re-made.

58. The appeal is remade as refused under Article 3 ECHR
