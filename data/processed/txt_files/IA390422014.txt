                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Kosovo who was born  on  the  9th  August
    1999. She appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Caswell who, in a decision published on the 20th January 2015,
    dismissed  her  appeal  against  the  respondent's   refusal   of   her
    application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom  on  private  and
    family life grounds.

 2. I order that the anonymity direction made in the First-tier Tribunal be
    continued.

Background

 3. The background facts have been largely uncontroversial throughout these
    proceedings and may conveniently be summarised as follows.

 4. The appellant takes her Kosovan nationality  from  her  parents  albeit
    that she was in fact born in Germany.  Her  mother  died  on  the  29th
    February 2000 when she was only a few months old. Her father  remarried
    soon afterwards and sent the appellant and her sister (AB) to live with
    his brothers  in  Kosovo,  whilst  he  remained  in  Germany  with  the
    appellant's other sister and her brother. The appellant has seen little
    of her father since that time. AB married in 2013 and  joined  her  new
    husband in the United Kingdom. The appellant entered the United Kingdom
    on the 1st February 2014, with leave to remain until the 14th July 2014
    in order to visit AB. The original plan had been for the  appellant  to
    visit her sister for two weeks and thereafter return to Kosovo in order
    to complete her education. However, the  appellant  told  AB  that  her
    uncles in Kosovo were unkind to her and had made it clear that she  was
    not wanted. As a result, AB's husband spoke to one of  the  appellant's
    uncles by telephone. The uncle stated that  he  could  no  longer  look
    after the appellant because he had four children of  his  own  to  look
    after. The appellant was therefore enrolled in a British school, on the
    31st March 2014, where she is said to be happy and settled.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The core of Judge Caswell's decision can be found at paragraphs  15  to
    26 -

         "15. The Appellant is still a child, and her  background  makes  it
             credible that she has a close relationship with her sister AB,
             with whom she has lived all her life, until the sister came to
             the UK in July 2013. The fact that AB is eleven  years  older,
             and that she and the Appellant were both sent back  to  Kosovo
             together, and  remained  in  the  same  household  until  AB's
             marriage, makes it entirely credible that  they  will  have  a
             particularly close bond. Further, the  fact  that  neither  of
             their parents has played an  active  part  in  their  everyday
             lives must have made them closer. In the circumstances,  I  am
             satisfied that there is family life between the Appellant  and
             AB, and that this extends now to [AB's husband].

         16. At the same time, however, the limits to the strength  of  the
             ties between AB and the Appellant must be measured by the fact
             that AB left her sister without any  thought  of  keeping  her
             with her, when she married. She also  had  no  concerns  about
             leaving the Appellant with the uncles and  cousins,  who  also
             have been part of the Appellant's close family for as long  as
             she will be able to remember. It is not the case, I find, that
             the  Appellant  or  AB  would  find   it   severely   damaging
             emotionally to be separated geographically, especially as they
             can, and according to the evidence  have,  kept  in  touch  by
             phone and other modern forms of  communication.  In  addition,
             there is no reason put forward to suggest that  AB  could  not
             return to Kosovo to visit her sister.

         17. Having said all that, however, I am prepared  to  accept  that
             the Appellant has shown both that there is family life between
             her and her sister and that this will be  interfered  with  if
             she is made to return to Kosovo.

         18. There is no dispute that the interference is lawful and serves
             the legitimate  aim  of  the  protection  of  the  social  and
             economic interests of the UK through the maintenance  of  fair
             and effective immigration control. On the issue of whether the
             interference is  proportionate,  I  consider  the  Appellant's
             position first. I am asked to find that she  is  desperate  to
             stay with her sister, that her uncles feel she is a burden and
             do not want her back, and that she wants  to  stay  where  she
             feels wanted, and with a sister who has always looked out  for
             her and whom she looks up to as a parent.

         19. The Appellant has been in school since March 2014 and I accept
             has settled  well  there.  I  am  asked  to  accept  that  the
             household is managing without public funds,  even  though  the
             income is less than half of the  entry  clearance  requirement
             sum, and that this situation will continue. However, the  bank
             statements do not show large balances and in my judgement that
             aspect has not been clearly made out. Of course, by  attending
             school the Appellant  is  availing  herself  of  UK  resources
             already. She speaks English, I find, although she needed  some
             help from the interpreter. She  is  obviously  making  a  firm
             attempt to integrate into British life, and  the  evidence  is
             that she has succeeded so  far.  However,  her  time  in  this
             country has still been very limited,  less  than  a  year.  By
             contrast, she has lived in Kosovo nearly all  her  life,  from
             the age of 2. She also has links to Germany, by reason of  the
             fact she was born there, her father lives there and so do  her
             other two siblings.

         20. Although I am told that the uncle or uncles find her to  be  a
             burden, it seems strange that this was not the case before her
             sister left and has only become the case since.  There  is  an
             absence of evidence concerning the family and  environment  in
             Kosovo. It has not said that the uncles have been cruel to the
             Appellant, or that they have abused her in  any  way.  Clearly
             there are children of similar age  to  the  Appellant  in  the
             household and A B's  statement  says  that  their  father  has
             visited at least once a year.

         21. I am asked to find that it is understandable that there is  no
             evidence from the uncles  in  Kosovo.  However,  there  is  no
             evidence here of any actions that would cause the breaking off
             of all communication between them. In fact, I am told A B  has
             spoken to the uncle, and  the  Appellant  has  spoken  to  his
             daughters. It does not make sense, in my  judgment,  that  the
             uncles would not be able  to  provide  come  evidence  of  the
             situation with them and their wishes as regards the Appellant.



         22. Such evidence is all the more needed, in my judgment,  because
             there is no real evidence of any problem in Kosovo apart  from
             what the Appellant has told her sister, and that only once she
             arrived in the UK. The conversation with the uncle reported by
             Mr Baftiu, if accurate, is consistent with the  uncle  wanting
             some help to share the  burden,  financial  or  otherwise,  of
             looking after the Appellant,  but  really  does  not  go  much
             further than that.

         23. The fact that the Appellant's  father  has  consented  to  her
             living with A B does not take  matters  much  further,  in  my
             judgment, since he has evidently not wanted  to  offer  her  a
             home himself up until now, and wanted other family members  to
             care for her. Having the  Appellant  cared  for  by  A  B  and
             supported by her husband in the UK, where she has a number  of
             opportunities, would clearly be a good option from  his  point
             of view.

         24. There is also a very limited amount of evidence  generally  in
             this appeal. There are letters from the  school  to  show  the
             Appellant is doing well, but no comment on  the  closeness  of
             the relationship with A B, her involvement with the school, or
             indeed  any  awareness  of  the  unusual  background  of   the
             Appellant. It is not said that the Appellant  will  suffer  in
             any way if returned to  Kosovo.  There  are  no  letters  from
             friends or other families to confirm the  bond  the  Appellant
             has with her sister, or the effect it would have on her if she
             were returned to Kosovo. There is no independent  evidence  of
             any emotional or psychological difficulties  or  fragility  on
             the part of the Appellant, or of any significant worry on  her
             part at the thought of being returned to Kosovo. In fact,  the
             evidence from school suggests she is healthy and doing well.

         25. Overall, and while I accept that the Appellant and her  sister
             are close and that they do both want the Appellant to stay  in
             the UK, I am not satisfied that I have been given a  full  and
             accurate account of circumstances generally, and in Kosovo  in
             particular. I am not satisfied that it has been shown that the
             best interests of the Appellant lie in her  remaining  in  the
             UK, away from her country, the household and  family  she  has
             grown up in, and the school and friends there, as well as  her
             own language and culture.

         26. Having considered all the  evidence  before  me,  I  find  the
             Respondent has shown that removal of the Appellant  to  Kosovo
             is proportionate. It follows that  the  appeal  on  Article  8
             grounds fails."

Analysis of the grounds of appeal

 6. The first and seemingly only ground upon which permission to appeal was
    granted by Judge Hollingworth, on the 11th March 2015, is centred  upon
    what is said to be the judge's failure to make "credibility  findings".
    I confess that I have some difficulty in understanding this  ground  of
    appeal and, indeed, the terms of the grant of permission.  Both  appear
    to be predicated upon an assumption that  the  appellant's  credibility
    was substantially in issue whereas, as I observed at paragraph 2 above,
    the vast majority  of  the  facts  were  not  in  issue.  It  was  thus
    unnecessary for the judge to make extensive findings with regard to the
    appellant's 'credibility'. All that was required was for the  judge  to
    decide whether the appellant had discharged the burden of  proving  the
    primary facts upon which the success of her appeal depended. This meant
    considering the extent to which the appellant (a) had retained  private
    and family life ties to Kosovo,  and  (b)  had  established  such  ties
    during the course of her relatively brief stay in the United Kingdom.

 7. With regard to appellant's retained ties to Kosovo,  the  main  factual
    issue was whether the appellant had proved that she was  mistreated  by
    her uncle when living in Kosovo. In that regard, the judge was right to
    observe that the appellant's case was simply that her uncle had made it
    clear that he regarded her continued membership of his household  as  a
    burden; there was no suggestion that he had been cruel to  her.  Within
    that context, the judge was at liberty to  conclude  that  (a)  it  was
    strange that the  appellant  had  only  complained  about  her  uncle's
    supposed resentment towards her after she had  arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom, and (b) it was reasonable to expect that there would  be  some
    form of statement or letter from the uncle expressing  his  contentment
    with, if not enthusiastic support for, a proposal that  she  henceforth
    reside with her sister. The judge was  entitled  to  conclude  that  in
    those circumstances the appellant had failed to prove that  there  were
    any significant obstacles to her returning to Kosovo [paragraphs 20  to
    23].

 8. With regard to the question of whether the  appellant  had  proved  her
    claimed links to the United Kingdom, the judge is  criticised  (in  the
    fifth ground) for expecting the appellant's UK school to  comment  upon
    the closeness of the relationship between the appellant and her sister.
    However, it is clear from a reading of paragraph 24 as a whole that the
    judge was simply drawing attention to the limitations of  the  evidence
    provided in order to support the claim that the appellant had developed
    close personal ties beyond those of her immediate family circle in  the
    relatively brief period of her residence in the  United  Kingdom.  That
    was an entirely legitimate exercise. It did not mean  (as  the  grounds
    appear to suggest) that the judge was thereby finding that  the  report
    lacked 'credibility'. Moreover, the charge that the judge 'ignored' the
    evidence of the appellant's sister and brother-in-law (evidence that is
    said to have "delved" into the closeness of their familial bond to  the
    appellant) is entirely without foundation. On the contrary,  the  judge
    made an express finding that  they  had  "a  particularly  close  bond"
    [paragraph 15].

 9. I am thus unable to find any merit in the first and  fifth  grounds  of
    appeal, which are in reality nothing more than a quarrel with  findings
    that were reasonably open to the judge on the evidence. As I previously
    observed, it is my no means  clear  that  Judge  Hollingsworth  granted
    permission to argue the other grounds. I am in any event satisfied that
    they do not identify any material error(s) of  law.  This  is  for  the
    following reasons.

10. The second ground takes exception to the judge's  suggestion  that  the
    appellant and her sister would be able "to keep in touch by  phone  and
    other modern forms of communication". Reliance is placed  upon  remarks
    made by Blake J  in  Mansoor  [2011]  EWCH  832  (Admin)  in  which  he
    expressed the view that such communication does not  constitute  family
    life.  However,  observations  made  in  the  course  of  handing  down
    judgement in an application for judicial review should not  be  treated
    as though they are generally applicable principles of law.  Rather,  it
    is necessary to consider them within the context of the factual  matrix
    of the case. Each case is fact-sensitive. In this case, it was entirely
    reasonable for the judge to observe that  the  appellant's  sister  had
    been content to maintain  family  ties  by  such  means  following  her
    voluntary departure from Kosovo in order to settle with her husband  in
    the United Kingdom, and that she would  be  able  to  resume  doing  so
    following the appellant's return to Kosovo.

11. The third ground complains that the judge measured the ability  of  the
    appellant's  sister  and  brother-in-law  to  maintain  the   appellant
    adequately by reference to an annual gross income of �18,600, which  is
    the threshold set by Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules. It is argued
    that the judge ought instead to have measured it against the much lower
    level of Income Support. That argument is  entirely  misconceived.  The
    judge was required to have regard to the fact that it is in the  public
    interest that persons seeking settlement  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
    financially  independent  (see  Section  117B(2)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002). The threshold in Appendix FM is  that
    which the legislature has  deemed  necessary  in  order  to  support  a
    married couple without any recourse to public funds. By  contrast,  the
    Income Support level is simply the amount that is required in order  to
    survive at a subsistence  level.  If  anything,  therefore,  the  judge
    understated the income that the appellant's sister  and  brother-in-law
    would need in order to maintain her without recourse to  public  funds,
    because the �18,600 threshold is that which is deemed necessary  for  a
    married couple without children.

12. Perhaps the strongest ground (which, it will  be  recalled,  is  not  a
    ground for which permission to appeal has been granted) is the  fourth;
    namely, that the judge  erred  by  having  regard  to  the  appellant's
    familial  links  to  Germany.  The  relevance  of  those  links  to  an
    assessment of the consequences  of  removing  the  appellant  from  the
    United Kingdom to Kosovo is by no means immediately  apparent  and  was
    not explained by the judge.  However,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the
    reference to it in the final sentence of paragraph 19 was not one  that
    played any part in the outcome of  the  appeal.  On  the  contrary,  it
    appears only to have been mentioned by way of an aside. Given that  the
    remainder of the judge's reasoning is sound, I am  satisfied  that  the
    apparently extraneous reference to the appellant's links to Germany  do
    not warrant setting aside the First-tier Tribunal's decision.
