                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -


    JUDGE perkins:


 1. With permission granted at an oral renewal hearing  by  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Southern (as he then was) the applicant seeks  to  challenge  the
    respondent's decision on 14 October 2016 to refuse his  application  on
    the same date for indefinite leave to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom
    under Tier 1 of the Points Based System.

 2. The application was refused under paragraph  322(5)  of  HC  395.   The
    respondent found it undesirable for the applicant to  be  permitted  to
    remain in the United Kingdom in the light of his conduct.

 3. It was also refused under paragraphs 19(i) to 19(j) of  Appendix  A  of
    the Immigration Rules because the respondent regarded the  evidence  of
    earnings as so discredited by the conduct complained of  that  she  did
    not accept that the applicant satisfied the requirements of  the  Rules
    at all. Although superficially this sounds like a separate, additional,
    reason for refusing the application it is, I find, a variation  on  the
    same theme. It is based on  the  same  factual  premise  as  the  other
    reasons and adds nothing of substance to the case.

 4. It is settled law and (I think) agreed by the parties that the scope of
    judicial review  is  limited  to  determining  the  lawfulness  of  the
    decision complained of. It is not for the Tribunal  to  decide  if  the
    applicant has behaved in the manner alleged but if the  respondent  was
    entitled to reach the conclusion that she did for the reasons that  are
    given and, if not, then if any remedy is justified (see, for example  R
    (on the application of Giri) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 784).

 5. It is the applicant's case that the decision was unlawful  because  the
    respondent  made  the  decision  without  giving   the   applicant   an
    opportunity to comment on the reasons that would be relied upon  before
    the decision is made.

 6. However I begin by considering the reasons given by the respondent  for
    his decision.

 7. The respondent's enquiries revealed mismatches between the  applicant's
    income declared to HMRC for the purposes of assessing his liability  to
    taxation and the income declared to the respondent for the purposes  of
    showing compliance with the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  The
    mismatches  are  described  in  the  Detailed  Grounds  of  Defence  as
    "profound".

 8. The applicant told HMRC that he earned �1,000 from  self-employment  in
    the tax year ending April 2011 but on 4 April 2011, almost at  the  end
    of that tax year, he relied on income from self-employment in  the  sum
    of �45,630 to support his application for leave as a Tier  1  (General)
    Migrant. Further, the applicant told HMRC that he earned  a  profit  of
    �2,450 from self-employment for the tax  year  ending  April  2014  but
    about half way through that tax year, in September 2013, he had claimed
    income of �39,668 from self-employment to support  an  application  for
    further leave as  a  Tier  1  (General)  Migrant.  There  may  be  some
    unavoidable inconsistencies arising from the  "immigration"  and  "tax"
    accounting periods differing but the applicant accepts that his returns
    were wrong and has mounted no serious  challenge  to  the  respondent's
    figures. I regard the respondent's use of the word  "profound"  in  the
    sense of "great" or "extreme" as entirely apt.

 9. Paragraph 322(5) of HC 395 states that amongst the general grounds  for
    refusing an application there is the:
       "Undesirability of permitting the person concerned to remain  in  the
       United Kingdom in the light of  his  conduct  (including  convictions
       which do not fall within paragraph 322(1C), character or associations
       or the fact that he represents a threat to national security".

10. The respondent was persuaded that the applicant had been  dishonest  in
    his dealings with HMRC and/or UK Visas and Immigration.

11. The Reasons for Decision dated 14 October 2016 continues:
       "It is acknowledged that paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules is
       not a mandatory refusal, however  the  evidence  submitted  does  not
       satisfactorily demonstrate that the failure to declare to HMRC at any
       time any of the self-employed  earnings  declared  on  your  previous
       application for leave to remain in the  UK  as  a  Tier  1  (General)
       Migrant was a genuine error.  It is noted that there would have  been
       a clear benefit to yourself either by failing to  declare  your  full
       earnings to HMRC with respect to reducing your tax  liability  or  by
       falsely representing your earnings to UK  Visas  and  Immigration  to
       enable you to meet the points required to obtain leave to  remain  in
       the United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant."

12. The decision was maintained on Administrative  Review  on  22  November
    2016.  Particularly significantly the letter stated:
       "You state  in  your  Administrative  Review  application  that  your
       original caseworker failed to provide  you  with  an  opportunity  to
       explain the discrepancy before refusing your application.  You  state
       that you provided the SA302s issued by HMRC for the last  five  years
       between 2010 and 2015 which you state demonstrates  the  income  that
       you declared to UKVI in support of your  previous  application.   You
       state that you had no knowledge that the HMRC database would  contain
       different information to that in the SA302s.  You state that as  such
       the  original  caseworker  should  have  sought  clarification   from
       yourself before refusing your application.
       Careful consideration has been given  to  all  the  points  you  have
       raised as outlined above.  However we maintain that the  decision  to
       refuse your application was correct.  We uphold  that  ultimately  it
       was your personal responsibility, and not that of your accountant, to
       ensure that the earnings submitted to UKVI to gain  leave  to  remain
       were correct and represent your  actual  earnings.   Furthermore,  we
       maintain that it is not credible that you would seek advice  from  an
       individual claiming to be an accountant who would  subsequently  fail
       to declare the correct earnings to HMRC on your behalf.  On review of
       your case, we find that there is no  reason  to  believe  your  self-
       employed tax returns were particularly complex and it  is  considered
       that you should have taken reasonable care to ensure your tax returns
       were accurate when submitted."

13. There are certain key paragraphs in the respondent's skeleton  argument
    which I find go to the very core of the matter and I respectfully adopt
    them into my judgment. At paragraph 38 the respondent says:
       "38. Further, it is entirely incredulous that the  Applicant,  whilst
       paying over �4,000 for his employed income  of  �25,678.00  in  2010-
       2011, could reasonably conclude that his tax liability in relation to
       self-employment income of �35,000 could be �200.60,  even  if  it  is
       accepted that he was unfamiliar with the precise working  of  the  UK
       tax system at the time.
       39.  The Applicant's contention is further  undermined  by  the  fact
       that in the following tax year, the Applicant ought to have  realised
       that a significant error had in fact been made when he  was  required
       to pay a tax  liability  of  �6,778.15  in  relation  to  profits  of
       �22,200.00.  The Respondent contends that  the  Applicant  must  have
       realised that his previous tax returns were  entirely  erroneous  and
       ought to have sought rectification of the same at that time,  if  his
       explanation is credible."

14. I am entirely satisfied that the Respondent was entitled to find on the
    evidence before him that the  applicant  had  been  deceitful  and  was
    unsuitable but it the applicant's case that the respondent  should  not
    have made  the  decision  just  on  that  information.  Permission  was
    originally sought on grounds not drawn by Mr  Saini  but  by  different
    Counsel (also experienced) and it is clear that one of  the  complaints
    supporting ground 1  was  that  the  "respondent  should  have  invited
    further comment or submissions from the applicant in  relation  to  the
    alleged discrepancies before refusing the application".

15. When Upper Tribunal Judge Southern gave permission he stated:
       "Although a good deal of the evidence upon which the applicant  seeks
       to rely postdates the decision under challenge in these  proceedings,
       for the  reasons  summarised  in  Mr  Saini's  most  recent  skeleton
       argument (dated today, 15 January 2018) it is at least arguable  that
       the respondent  arrived  too  readily  at  her  conclusion  that  the
       applicant had been dishonest in his dealings with HMRC  and  that  in
       doing  so  she  either  left  out  of  account  altogether   or   had
       insufficient  regard  to  matters  that  should  have  informed   her
       decision."

16. Although Mr Saini was right to make the point in this case, because  it
    is the real point of dispute between the parties, his core proposition,
    that the applicant was entitled, as a matter of law, to respond  before
    the decision was made, is so well-established as a general rule that it
    verged on the trite. If authority is necessary it is supported  by  the
    judgment of the Supreme Court in Bank Mellat (Appellant) v HM  Treasury
    (Respondent) (No. 2).  For example, at paragraph  178  Lord  Neuberger,
    agreeing with Lord Sumption in the same case, said:
       "As Lord Sumption says in paras 29-30, where the executive intends to
       exercise a statutory power to a person's substantial detriment, it is
       well established that, in the absence of special  facts,  the  common
       law imposes a duty on the executive to give notice to that person  of
       its intention, and to give that person an  opportunity  to  be  heard
       before the power is so exercised.  While this has been described as a
       'rule  of  universal  application  ...  founded  upon  the   plainest
       principles of justice' (per Willes J in Cooper v Board of  Works  for
       the Wandsworth District (1863) 14 CB (NS)  180,  190),  it  has  most
       recently been expressed in somewhat more  measured  terms.   In  R  v
       Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex p  Doody  [1994]  1  AC
       531, 560, Lord Mustill said that 'fairness' will
       'very often require that a person who may be  adversely  affected  by
       the decision will have an opportunity  to  make  representations  ...
       either before the decision is taken ...; or after it is taken with  a
       view to procuring its modification'."

17. I am satisfied that refusing a person indefinite leave to remain in the
    United Kingdom because the person is "unsuitable" is a  decision  taken
    to "a person's substantial detriment".

18. I know nothing which limits to the exercise of a  statutory  power  the
    need to give a person affected by the proposed decision an  opportunity
    to explain apparently bad conduct before the decision is made.

19. It follows that I see  intrinsic  merit  in  the  contention  that  the
    decision should not have been made, and certainly not maintained, until
    the applicant had been given notice of the  respondent's  concerns.  It
    does not follow that the respondent acted unlawfully  in  not  inviting
    comment in  this  case  or  that  even  if  the  respondent  had  acted
    unlawfully that any remedy is needed.

20. It is the applicant's case that he  had  no  reason  to  anticipate  an
    adverse decision and so did not see any need to explain  his  erroneous
    tax declarations. If this  contention  is  made  out  it  enhances  the
    applicant's case because he could not be expected to  have  anticipated
    the reasons for refusal when he made his application.

21. The respondent's answer to this point is found mainly at  paragraph  41
    of the skeleton argument on behalf of the respondent drawn  by  Miss  M
    Bayoumi of Counsel and relied upon by Ms Idelbi. This states:
       "The Applicant also seeks to argue that he ought to have  been  given
       the opportunity to explain the discrepancies  before  the  Respondent
       rejected the application.  The Respondent repeats that the  Applicant
       was well aware of the fact that  the  Respondent  would  liaise  with
       other agencies to obtain  further  information.   The  Applicant  was
       aware of the so-called discrepancies in his tax returns from as early
       as October 2015 and ought to have provided evidence  to  explain  the
       same as part of his application."

22. I am not impressed by the respondent's argument.

23. I recognise that the applicant had been told that the  respondent  made
    enquiries of other government agencies  and  so  it  should  have  been
    apparent to the applicant that the respondent would probably have known
    that he  had  amended  his  tax  returns  and  therefore  that  he  had
    previously, for some reason, made an erroneous tax return.  That is not
    the same as saying the applicant was on notice that he would be refused
    Indefinite Leave to  Remain  because  he  had  changed,  he  might  say
    "corrected", his tax returns.

24. The respondent might be expected to refuse an application if  HMRC  had
    concerns about a person's integrity but it seems that HMRC has no  such
    concerns. None were expressed before the decision was made and there is
    a "post decision" letter dated 18 August 2017 from a Mr Steve Jones  of
    HMRC saying "We have no reason to believe you are dishonest".

25. It is clear from the papers, although hardly surprising, that HMRC  has
    an extensive range of penalties that it can sometimes impose on  people
    whose returns are late or wrong or amended or otherwise  unsatisfactory
    but no penalties were imposed on this applicant.

26. The position might have been entirely different if HMRC  had  indicated
    that a penalty would be imposed or a prosecution was likely to  follow.
    In that event it would surely have been clear to the applicant that his
    explanation had not  been  accepted.  The  applicant  had  (eventually)
    provided accurate returns after they had been corrected and he was  not
    subject to any criticism by HMRC. Here the applicant  was  entitled  to
    think that his explanation had been accepted by HMRC. I  find  that  he
    should not be disadvantaged for failing to  anticipate  the  respondent
    taking a different view.

27. The respondent's skeleton argument criticises  the  applicant  for  not
    being  more  forthcoming  in  the  questionnaire   completed   at   his
    appointment at the Premium  Service  Centre.   The  parties  before  me
    informed me that the terms of the questionnaire that  an  applicant  is
    now expected to answer  have  been  extended  considerably  since  this
    applicant completed the form.

28. The decision is dated 14 October 2016.  The  relevant  question  is  at
    number 9 of the interview and states:
       "Are you satisfied the Self Assessment tax return submitted  to  HMRC
       accurately reflected your Self-Employed income?"

29. The applicant was required to mark with a tick one of two  boxes.   One
    box was labelled "Yes", which is the box that the applicant ticked, and
    the other was marked "No" and continued  "If  not,  why  not  and  what
    further action have you taken to address it?"   The  next  question  at
    number 10 asks for any other comments.  This form was completed  on  14
    October 2016.  The applicant could have used this as an opportunity  to
    have said more but he was  asked  a  question  that  he  was  at  least
    entitled to assume related to the present state of the returns that  he
    had submitted and he answered, in a  way  wholly  consistent  with  his
    case, that he was  satisfied  that  the  (amended)returns  (eventually)
    submitted reflected accurately his income. They had been amended on his
    instructions to do precisely that.  It may have been more helpful if he
    had given a more expansive answer but the answer he gave is a  complete
    answer to the question actually asked and he is not  to  be  criticised
    for that. I do not agree that the applicant should have  said  more  in
    response to the question considered above or that  the  respondent  was
    entitled to think that he should.  The respondent was not  entitled  to
    assume that the applicant would have seen any point in explaining  more
    fully when he  completed  the  questionnaire  the  reasons  for  making
    returns  which  he  acknowledges,  and  had  acknowledged  before   the
    application was made, although quite possibly in anticipation of making
    it, were wrong.

30. I do not accept that the respondent was entitled to conclude  from  the
    answer  to  this  question  that  applicant  was  withholding  relevant
    information. The respondent should have realised the  ambiguity  or  at
    least the lack of precision in the question.

31. That said, I do not accept that the respondent was in any way bound  by
    the decision of HMRC not to impose a penalty.

32. Here HMRC has been  notified  of  an  inconsistency  or  error  in  the
    declaration of income and did not impose any penalty. There may be many
    reasons for this.  HMRC plainly have a duty to encourage the payment of
    taxes and may well not be in any hurry to impose a penalty  on  someone
    who draws to its attention an error in his  declarations  and  puts  it
    right before being caught by HMRC.  Penalties  in  such  case  may  not
    represent a sensible use of resources.  Further,  dishonesty  might  be
    hard to prove where the main evidence comes from the voluntary  act  of
    the allegedly dishonest person.

33. The failure to impose a penalty is not a  ringing  endorsement  of  the
    applicant's character and it does not  bind  the  respondent.  Further,
    unlike HMRC, the respondent's decision on the applicant's character was
    informed not only by an admittedly erroneous return but  by  additional
    conflicting evidence given by the applicant  about  his  means  at  the
    material time. I cannot assume that  HMRC  would  have  maintained  its
    position if it knew these facts but that  is  unimportant.  I  am  only
    concerned with the respondent's decision.

34. In any event the respondent had to assess the  applicant's  suitability
    to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom.  It  does  not  follow  from  the
    respondent's decision not to impose a penalty that the applicant  is  a
    suitable person.

35. The Secretary of State's grounds refer to the respondent's policy.  The
    Secretary of State's skeleton argument indicates that the  respondent's
    policy requires that:
       "The key thing to consider  is  if  there  is  reliable  evidence  to
       support a decision that the person's behaviour  calls  into  question
       their character and/or  conduct  and/or  their  associations  to  the
       extent that it is undesirable to allow them to enter or remain in the
       UK.  This may include cases where a migrant has entered, attempted to
       enter or facilitated a sham marriage to  evade  immigration  control.
       If you are  not  sure  the  evidence  to  support  your  decision  is
       reliable, then speak to your line manager or senior caseworker."

36. The part of the policy that was drawn to my attention does not consider
    whether it is necessary or even  desirable  to  give  an  applicant  an
    opportunity to respond to the matters of concern before a  decision  is
    made.

37. I could approach this point from many angles and with  varying  degrees
    of learning but the simple point is that Mr Saini says the Secretary of
    State was wrong not to give an applicant an opportunity to  respond.  I
    do see the strength of that.  It might be different if it was  a  point
    that should have been anticipated or if the  applicant  was  on  notice
    that the respondent was likely to take the point but that  is  not  the
    case here.  Looked at from the applicant's position  I  can  understand
    his sense of grievance.

38. Mr Saini was right when he submitted that the  nature  of  the  refusal
    under paragraph 322(5) is wide ranging and hard to predict and  in  the
    absence of some clear pointer it is just not possible for an  applicant
    in a manageably concise application to cover everything that just might
    be of concern to the Secretary of State.  This  enhances  the  argument
    that the applicant should be given  notice  before  refusal  under  322
    takes place.

39. In all the circumstances I am not persuaded  that  the  respondent  was
    entitled to assume that the application should have anticipated refusal
    and so should have addressed the likely reasons in his application.

40. The applicant had, and took, the opportunity of seeking  Administrative
    Review but Administrative Review is not necessarily a suitable  remedy.
    This is because the Immigration Rules prescribe that a  reviewer  "will
    not consider any evidence that was not  before  the  original  decision
    maker"  except  where  certain  conditions  exist  including  that  the
    evidence submitted goes to refusal under paragraph  322(2)  of  HC  395
    (see Immigration  Rules  AR2.3  and  AR2.4).   Refusals,  such  as  the
    decision complained of, under  paragraph  322(5)  cannot  be  addressed
    under Administrative Review by relying on new evidence.  Given  that  I
    have accepted Mr Saini's point that paragraph 322(5)  is  far  reaching
    and may well throw up points that  cannot  be  anticipated  I  see  the
    strength of his case.  I have no hesitation in saying that  the  system
    of refusing under paragraph 322(5) without putting a party on notice is
    potentially procedurally unfair.

41. However the difficulty with the applicant's case beyond this  point  is
    that it becomes very weak.  I have considered the respondent's  grounds
    and skeleton argument.  For the reasons outlined above I agree that the
    respondent's decision was entirely rational on the  information  before
    her.  If there is any criticism to be made it  is  in  not  giving  the
    applicant an opportunity to put before the respondent any answer he may
    have  to  the  damage  to  his  application   that   flows   from   the
    inconsistencies between his declarations to HMRC and to the respondent.



42. It is not established that the procedure is unfair because  it  is  not
    established that  the  decision  would  have  been  maintained  if  the
    applicant had  anything  worthwhile  to  say.  It  is  clear  from  the
    respondent's decision on Administrative Review that the respondent  was
    willing to consider that applicant's explanation before maintaining the
    decision, even if the reason was outside the scope of the rules. I find
    it significant that the tone of the respondent's letter was not "we  do
    no have to consider this point" but "there is nothing in this point".

43. In order to avoid criticism based on procedure there clearly  needs  to
    be a  mechanism  in  the  decision-making  process  to  give  room  for
    consideration of a good explanation for a previously  unknown  problem.
    It is unlikely, but not inconceivable, for example  that  an  applicant
    might want to say that the records disclosed by HMRC are entirely wrong
    and may relate to a different case. It is hard to think that  a  person
    who could make good such a claim would be left without a remedy however
    rational the respondent's decision might have seemed to  have  been  on
    the evidence available. That is  a  problem  to  be  addressed  if  the
    circumstances arise but the respondent's explanation on  administrative
    review suggests strongly  that  the  respondent  would  be  willing  to
    reconsider a decision supported by good  evidence.  There  is  no  such
    evidence here.

44. Much is made of the applicant being a solicitor.  No-one was  so  crass
    as to suggest that this entitled him to  special  treatment.   That  is
    certainly not how Mr Saini put the case.  Solicitors are  not  entitled
    to be believed because they are  solicitors  but  a  person  who  is  a
    solicitor can be assumed to be both a person of good  character  and  a
    person who had much to lose if he loses that  character.  I  do  accept
    that a person who has more to lose is entitled to expect the  Secretary
    of State to think again before concluding  that  the  person  is  being
    dishonest, not for reasons of sympathy but because the  potential  loss
    to the applicant makes it less likely that he would cheat.

45. I doubt that a person's  honesty  can  ever  be  determined  solely  by
    reference to his antecedents but it is likely to be a  relevant  factor
    in a case where the decision maker is uncertain because the evidence is
    not compelling.

46. The applicant complains that no regard was given to his  character  and
    he would, if given the opportunity, have relied on evidence of his good
    character.

47. The problem is that the applicant has not shown how he could have taken
    advantage of any opportunity that he had  been  given  to  address  the
    respondent's concerns.

48. Notwithstanding the general position that is so clearly  elucidated  by
    Mr Saini, I do not accept that the Respondent must put every point that
    might be held against a person seeking leave before making a  decision.
    The cases relied on by Mr Saini fall  short  of  that.  Lord  Neuberger
    accepted the qualification "very often" when he summarised the  general
    position.

49. Mr Saini may have identified a theoretical deficiency in the  decision-
    making process because of the ambiguous question in interview which, as
    I have explained, may well have been answered honestly  but,  from  the
    respondent's perspective, unhelpfully.

50. Mr Saini has not been able to show that the decision-making process  in
    force is so deficient that a good explanation offered after  the  event
    for an unpredictable difficulty would have been rejected. All  that  he
    has been able to show is that a decision  made  rationally  on  limited
    information was upheld when a weak explanation was tendered. That is no
    enough to persuade me that the procedure in force is unlawful.

51. However, even if it  did,  I  am  not  persuaded  that  any  remedy  is
    appropriate here.

52. There is before me considerable  evidence  purporting  to  explain  the
    discrepancy but it is entirely unsatisfactory. Nothing has  been  shown
    the undermine the respondent's conclusion that the discrepancies are so
    large that they cannot be explained innocently.

53. I appreciate that it is the applicant's case that he did not  even  see
    the first tax return  although  that  does  not  excuse  him  from  the
    responsibility of making an accurate return.  He has  done  nothing  to
    make credible the suggestion that he thought that tax on �1,000 was the
    right tax to pay on an income in excess of �40,000.

54. I also acknowledge  that  the  applicant  is  an  educated  man  and  a
    qualified lawyer but this works to his disadvantage.  What  might  have
    been an excusable lapse on behalf of someone without those  educational
    advantages is not acceptable on a person who has them.  The error is so
    stark that the respondent was entitled to find it unbelievable that  it
    did not come to the applicant's attention that he was not paying nearly
    enough tax on this first year's income.

55. I also accept the alternative position of the respondent that even  if,
    contrary to the respondent's view which in my judgment, the  respondent
    was clearly entitled to hold, there is some  merit  in  the  contention
    that the applicant did not know that the tax  in  the  first  year  was
    wrong, it ought to have come to his attention in the second  year  when
    the sums were so different.

56. I have to conclude that the procedure adopted by the  respondent  might
    be open to criticism because it did not allow a person  an  opportunity
    to answer the point made. The  possibility  of  the  application  being
    rejected because of wrong tax declarations was not a point that  should
    have been anticipated and addressed when he made  the  application  and
    possibly could not be addressed after the decision was made.

57. I have to emphasise that this finding is  made  in  the  light  of  two
    particular points.  One is that the  error  was  corrected  before  the
    application for leave was made and secondly the declaration made at the
    time of the interview was answered truthfully by this applicant.  I  am
    told that more searching questions are now asked and  it  may  well  be
    that a person who got that far should under the present  regime  should
    have appreciated the importance of drawing to the Secretary of  State's
    attention that there was an inconsistency and offering  an  explanation
    for it.  That is not the case here but if this decision  has  any  far-
    reaching application it  is  limited  only  to  the  cases  where  that
    declaration was answered truthfully.  I do not  know  what  is  on  the
    present form, it is not something I have to decide.

58. Even so for the reasons given I refuse relief.

59. As indicated above,  I  find  the  discrepancies  between  the  incomes
    declared to HMRC and to the Respondent so "profound" that I can see  no
    answer to the inference that the Applicant must have known that he  had
    made a dishonest  tax  return.  This  is  not  a  marginal  case  where
    reflection on the applicant's character and professional standing might
    have made a different. Rather I find the inference of dishonesty to  be
    so strong that not even the most thorough regard to his good  character
    and  the  evidence  of  an  accountant's  mistake  will  overcome  that
    inference.

60. The respondent was entitled to conclude that the  Applicant  knew  that
    his return was false, if not when he made it then when he  had  a  very
    different tax liability the next year and nothing before me shows  that
    the applicant could rely on anything to rebut that evidence. This is  a
    case that cannot succeed.

61. Even if I am wrong to find, as I do, that the applicant has  failed  to
    show any unfairness in this case no relief is  appropriate.  If  I  had
    found actual rather than potential unfairness I would have I  dismissed
    the application with regard to section 31A of  the  Senior  Courts  Act
    1981 as amended.
In all the circumstances this application is dismissed.~~~~0~~~
