Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms Susana Cunha, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the respondent:    No appearance or representation.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Decision and reasons

 1. The Secretary of State appealed against the decision of the  First-tier
    Tribunal allowing the claimant's appeal  against  her  decision  on  13
    February 2018 to deport him to  the  Netherlands,  of  which  he  is  a
    citizen.

 2. Mode of hearing.  The hearing today took place  remotely  by  Microsoft
    Teams.  There were no technical difficulties.  I am satisfied  that  Ms
    Cunha was in a quiet  and  private  place  and  that  the  hearing  was
    completed fairly, with her cooperation.

 3. Procedural history.  On 16 February 2017, the claimant was convicted at
    Cardiff Crown Court of street supply of  Class  A  drugs  (cocaine  and
    heroin) and breach of bail conditions.  The claimant was  sentenced  to
    54 months' imprisonment, credit being given for his  previous  lack  of
    drug convictions and his late guilty plea. This was his first custodial
    sentence.   He did not respond to the Secretary of  State's  notice  of
    liability to deportation, but did appeal the deportation  order.    The
    First-tier Judge allowed the appeal on the basis that the claimant  had
    been resident in the United Kingdom for more than 10 years  but  failed
    to  consider  whether  his  residence  was  'in  accordance  with'  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.

 4. On 2 October 2020, I set aside the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    allowing the claimant's appeal, and directed that the decision in  this
    appeal be remade in the Upper Tribunal.  The claimant was  present  and
    represented himself.  He  admitted  that  he  had  lost  his  way  when
    younger, but said that he had learned his lesson and tried to make  the
    best of his time in prison.   The  claimant  assured  me  that  he  had
    evidence to show that he had exercised  Treaty  rights  in  the  United
    Kingdom for 10 years before the  deportation  decision,  or  at  least,
    before his conviction.   I  made  directions  for  disclosure  of  that
    evidence and consequential directions.  The claimant has  not  complied
    with  those  directions  and  the  consequential  directions  were  not
    triggered.

 5. The appeal was listed for a telephone  case  management  review  on  15
    February 2021.  The claimant did not join that hearing, nor  was  there
    any explanation for his absence.   I considered  that  it  was  in  the
    interests of justice to give the claimant an opportunity  to  attend  a
    substantive remaking hearing and to provide the materials  he  said  he
    possessed.

 6. The appeal was therefore listed for substantive  remaking  today.   The
    claimant did not attend, and there is  again  no  explanation  for  his
    absence.  Ms Cunha confirmed that the claimant was reporting  regularly
    and that he resides still at his notified address for service.    I  am
    satisfied that he had adequate notice of this hearing and that  he  has
    been properly served.

 7. I consider it appropriate, having regard to the  overriding  objective,
    and in the interests of justice, to proceed to remake the  decision  on
    the basis of the submissions of Ms Cunha for the  Secretary  of  State,
    and the evidence already before the Tribunal.   I have  had  regard  to
    all of the evidence, hard copy and electronic, in this appeal,  whether
    or not it is expressly mentioned in this decision.

Background

 8. The claimant was born in the Netherlands on 13 June 1993  and  came  to
    the United Kingdom in 2004 or 2005, with his  family.   He  would  have
    been 11 or 12 then.  Mr Walker accepts that  evidence  in  the  hearing
    bundle establishes his presence in the United  Kingdom  by  2005.   The
    claimant has had all of his secondary education in the United  Kingdom.
    His parents and siblings live in the United Kingdom.

 9. By 2008, the 15-year old claimant was in  trouble.   He  was  cautioned
    after being arrested for theft on 2 May 2008 and on 25 August 2011  was
    cautioned again for disorderly behaviour.  On the second  occasion,  he
    was 18 years old and an adult.  In 2011/2012,  the  claimant's  parents
    separated. His father had a new relationship and was not very  much  in
    contact with the claimant; his mother also stopped  communicating  with
    the claimant after her separation, by reason of his  criminality.   The
    claimant got on well with his older brother, and  sometimes  worked  in
    the brother's clinic or was given money to sustain his lifestyle.

10. Between 3 February 2012 and 16 February 2017, the claimant  accrued  12
    convictions for 19 offences, mostly theft  and  kindred  offences,  but
    also public order, police, courts and drug offences:

         (1)  On 3 February 2012, the claimant was convicted of  shoplifting
         contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968.   There  were  further
         convictions for theft on 16  March  2012,  for  shoplifting  on  23
         August 2012,22 October 2012, and on 25 November 2012 (some of these
         offences whilst on bail).  On 14 March 2013, he  was  convicted  of
         disorderly behaviour contrary to  section  5(1)(a)  of  the  Public
         Order Act.

         (2)  On 11 April 2013, he was convicted of failure to  comply  with
         the requirements of a community order, contrary to  Schedule  8  of
         the Criminal Justice  Act  2003,  and  on  10  September  2013,  of
         resisting or obstructing a constable in the exercise of his  duties
         contrary to section 89(2) of the Police Act 1996 and giving a false
         name and address contrary to the section 5(3)(c) of the  Regulation
         of Railways Act  1889.   On  21  October  2013,  the  claimant  was
         convicted of travelling  on  a  railway  without  paying  the  fare
         contrary to section 5 of the Regulation of Railways Act.

         (3)  On 18 March 2014, the claimant was convicted of going equipped
         for theft, other than theft of a motor vehicle, contrary to section
         25 of the Theft Act and theft from the person contrary to section 1
         of that Act.  On 9 May 2014, the claimant was  convicted  again  of
         going equipped for theft and also shoplifting.

         (4)  The index offence related to  street  drug  dealing  over  the
         period 1 January 2016-15 May 2016 (or perhaps August 2016, per  the
         OASys report).  The claimant was convicted on 16 February  2017  of
         offences contrary to section 4(2) and 4(3) of the Misuse  of  Drugs
         Act 1971, and of failure to surrender to custody at  the  appointed
         time, contrary to section 6(1) of the Bail Act 1975.

11. When arrested for the  index  offence  in  August  2016,  the  claimant
    replied 'no comment'  throughout  his  police  interview  and  did  not
    cooperate in unlocking his  mobile  phone  so  that  the  police  could
    examine it: when they were able to access it, the phone  was  found  to
    contain data consistent with dealing in drugs. He did  not  change  his
    plea to guilty until the hearing.

12. On 16 February 2017, the claimant  received  a  54-month  sentence  for
    street dealing (heroin and cocaine) which triggered the decision  under
    challenge. The sentencing judge accepted that the claimant was  'second
    in order of culpability'  but  found  that  his  role  in  the  dealing
    organisation was nevertheless  a  significant  one.   The  decision  to
    deport him was taken on 13 February 2018.  It was served on him  on  27
    February 2018, along with removal directions.   The  claimant  resisted
    removal to the  Netherlands  on  the  basis  that  he  is  entitled  to
    protection at the 'imperative grounds' level under Regulation 27(4)  of
    the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.

First-tier Tribunal decision

13. The Secretary of State accepted before the First-tier Tribunal that the
    claimant had obtained permanent residence under Regulation  15  of  the
    2016 Regulations.  On 13 February 2018, when the deportation order  was
    made, the claimant had been in prison serving his 4-year  sentence  for
    just under a year.

14. The First-tier Judge found the claimant to be  an  impressive  witness,
    who had expressed genuine remorse  for  his  previous  offending.   His
    father was seriously ill and he had nobody  in  the  Netherlands.   His
    father and step-mother, and their children, would  be  instrumental  in
    the claimant's rehabilitation.

15. At [85], the First-tier  Judge  considered  whether  the  claimant  had
    established that he had 10 years' continuous residence  in  the  United
    Kingdom 'in accordance with the Regulations', the relevant period being
    from 13 February 2008 to 13 February 2018 when the removal decision was
    made.  At [86]-[91], the First-tier Judge set out the evidence  of  the
    claimant's private life in the United  Kingdom.   At  [93],  the  judge
    found that the claimant's offending behaviour  had  not  displaced  any
    genuine integration, taking into account that a period of  imprisonment
    would not necessarily break a 10-year period of residence.

16. The First-tier Judge considered the decision of the Court of Appeal  in
    VP (Italy) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ
    806 and Essa v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2012]  EWCA
    Civ 1718 and found that, if the imperative grounds test  were  applied,
    the public interest in the claimant's deportation was outweighed by his
    personal  circumstances  and  that  there  was  no  significant  public
    interest in his deportation, arising out of the drug dealing conviction
    in  2017.   Removal  to  the  Netherlands  would  greatly  inhibit  his
    continued rehabilitation.

17. The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal.

OASys Report

18. An OASys report was carried out on 20 September 2018.  It noted that as
    well as dealing in drugs, the claimant had  his  own  substance  misuse
    problem, which was costing him about �20 a day, which was  a  struggle,
    hence his shoplifting and theft offences.  The work in  street  dealing
    was 'good money', but he had not thought through the consequences.   He
    relied on handouts from his family as his wages were minimal.   He  had
    no debt when interviewed for the OASys assessment.

19. The OASys report recorded that  the  claimant  had  pleaded  guilty  to
    supplying heroin, a Class A drug, between 1 January 2016 and 15  August
    2016.  The victims were substance misusers on the streets  of  Cardiff.
    The claimant had accepted responsibility, saying that 'it was  a  silly
    thing to do'.  At the time of committing the offence, he had a  history
    of  acquisitive  related  offending  and  was  banned  from  going   to
    Westfields in Cardiff.  The  offence  formed  part  of  an  established
    pattern of offending, but was an escalation.

20. The claimant had been living in his family home: his parents, a  sister
    and two brothers lived there as  well  and  it  would  be  his  release
    address.  He would be unemployed on release.  He had no qualifications.
     He had worked for his brother at the brother's private  clinic  for  a
    time, and could do this on release, but he did not consider the  family
    business to be a real job and would like to work elsewhere on  release.



21. The claimant had completed secondary education and obtained a number of
    GCSE examinations but dropped out of school after the first year of his
    'A' level study due to his offending and personal  circumstances.   The
    claimant was studying in prison: he had completed an access  course  in
    Law, but was not interested to pursue the subject further.  He hoped to
    attend college on release and to work in his brother's  clinic  to  get
    enough money to cover college.

22. The claimant had been  trying  to  repair  his  relationship  with  his
    mother, which had been damaged by his offending behaviour.   His father
    had a new relationship and by the time the appeal was heard before  the
    First-tier Tribunal, the evidence was that the claimant's  relationship
    with his father and the father's new family had improved.   His  father
    attended the hearing.  The claimant had no  relationship  of  his  own.
    Previous relationships had ended amicably and  there  was  no  domestic
    violence.

23. The claimant's brother has been supportive, both  with  employment  and
    financial handouts,  but  the  claimant's  evidence  was  that  he  was
    reluctant to engage seriously in his brother's business.

24. The  claimant  was  not  always  of  good  behaviour  in  prison:  when
    interviewed in September 2018, he had 5 adjudications in 4 months,  one
    for violence, one for refusal to comply with orders, two for having  an
    unauthorised USB stick, and one  for  testing  positive  for  the  drug
    Spice.  The OASys report identified that after release he would need to
    embark on structured activities to keep him  away  from  negative  peer
    groups.

25. While in prison, the claimant worked on  stress  management,  substance
    misuse and improving his employability skills. His attitude towards the
    community was considered  to  be  a  concern  and  was  linked  to  his
    offending behaviour.  He was  considered  to  have  poor  thinking  and
    behaviour, impulsivity, and problems caused by mixing with bad company.



26. The  claimant  was  considered  to  present  a  medium  (61%)  risk  of
    reoffending overall, with a 56% percent (medium)  risk  of  non-violent
    reoffending and a 22%(low) risk of violent reoffending.

The Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016

27. As a Dutch citizen, the claimant is an EEA citizen and the  Immigration
    (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2016  apply  to  this  appeal.
    Regulation 23(6) of the EEA Regulations sets out the  circumstances  in
    which  an  EEA  citizen  may  be  removed  from  the  United   Kingdom.
    Regulation 27 defines the ambit of a 'relevant decision':

         "Decisions taken on grounds of public policy, public  security  and
         public health

         27.- (1)      In this regulation, a "relevant  decision"  means  an
         EEA decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public security
         or public health. ...

         (3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect  of  a  person
         with a right of permanent residence under regulation 15  except  on
         serious grounds of public policy and public security.

         (4)  A relevant decision may not  be  taken  except  on  imperative
         grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-

             (a)  has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period
             of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision; or...

         (5)  The public policy and  public  security  requirements  of  the
         United Kingdom include restricting rights  otherwise  conferred  by
         these Regulations in order to protect the fundamental interests  of
         society, and where a relevant  decision  is  taken  on  grounds  of
         public  policy  or  public  security  it  must  also  be  taken  in
         accordance with the following principles-

             (a)   the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
             proportionality;

             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
                  conduct of the person concerned;

             (c)  the personal conduct  of  the  person  must  represent  a
                  genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting
                  one of the fundamental interests of society,  taking  into
                  account past conduct of the person  and  that  the  threat
                  does not need to be imminent;

             (d)  matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
                  which relate to considerations of  general  prevention  do
                  not justify the decision;

             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
                  themselves justify the decision; ...

         (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on  the  grounds  of  public
         policy and public security in relation to a  person  ("P")  who  is
         resident in the  United  Kingdom,  the  decision  maker  must  take
         account of considerations such as the age, state of health,  family
         and economic situation of P, P's length of residence in the  United
         Kingdom, P's  social  and  cultural  integration  into  the  United
         Kingdom and the extent of P's links with  P's  country  of  origin.
         ..."

MC (Essa principles recast) [2015] UKUT 520 (IAC) (11 September 2015)

28. In MC (Essa principles recast) the Upper Tribunal  gave  the  following
    guidance:

         1.   Essa rehabilitation principles are specific to decisions taken
         on public policy, public security and public health  grounds  under
         regulation 21 of the 2006 EEA Regulations.

         2.   It is only if the personal conduct of the person concerned  is
         found to represent a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
         threat affecting  one  of  the  fundamental  interests  of  society
         (regulation 21(5)(c)) that it becomes relevant to consider  whether
         the  decision  is  proportionate  taking  into  account   all   the
         considerations identified in regulation 21(5)-(6).

         3.   There is no specific reference in the expulsion provisions  of
         either  Directive  2004/38/EC  or  the  2006  EEA  Regulations   to
         rehabilitation, but it has been seen by the Court of Justice as  an
         aspect of integration, which is one of the factors referred  to  in
         Article 28(1) and regulation 21(6) (Essa (2013) at [23]).

         4.   Rehabilitation is not an issue to be addressed  in  every  EEA
         deportation or removal decision taken under regulation 21; it  will
         not be relevant, for example, if rehabilitation  has  already  been
         completed (Essa (2013) at [32]-[33]).

         5.   Reference to prospects of rehabilitation  concerns  reasonable
         prospects of a person ceasing  to  commit  crime  (Essa  (2013)  at
         [35]), not the mere possibility of rehabilitation. Mere  capability
         of rehabilitation is not to be equated with reasonable prospect  of
         rehabilitation.

         6.   Where relevant (see (4) above) such prospects are a factor  to
         be taken into account in the proportionality assessment required by
         regulation 21(5) and (6) ((Dumliauskas [41]).

         7.   Such prospects are to be taken into account even if not raised
         by the offender (Dumliauskas [52]).

         8.    Gauging  such  prospects  requires  assessing  the   relative
         prospects of rehabilitation in the host Member  State  as  compared
         with those in the Member State of origin, but, in  the  absence  of
         evidence, it is not to be assumed  that  prospects  are  materially
         different in that other Member State (Dumliauskas  [46],  [52]-[53]
         and [59]).

         9.   Matters that are relevant when examining the prospects of  the
         rehabilitation   of   offenders    include    family    ties    and
         responsibilities, accommodation, education,  training,  employment,
         active membership of a community  and  the  like  (Essa  (2013)  at
         [34]). However, lack of access to a Probation Officer or equivalent
         in  the  other  Member  State  should  not,  in  general,  preclude
         deportation (Dumliauskas [55]).

         10.  In the  absence  of  integration  and  a  right  of  permanent
         residence, the future prospects of integration cannot be a  weighty
         factor (Dumliauskas [44] and [54]). Even when such  prospects  have
         significant weight they are not a trump card, as what the Directive
         and the 2006 EEA Regulations require  is  a  wide-ranging  holistic
         assessment. Both recognise  that  the  more  serious  the  risk  of
         reoffending, and the offences that a person may commit, the greater
         the right to interfere with the right of residence (Dumliauskas  at
         [46] and [54]).

Terzaghi v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2019] EWCA Civ 2017

29. In Terzaghi v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2019]  EWCA
    Civ 2017, Lord Justice Dingemans, with whom Lord Justice Underhill  and
    Lord Justice Moylan agreed, set out the relevant  legal  principles  at
    [11]-[12]:

         "Relevant legal principles relating to integration for the purposes
         of the 2006 Regulations

         11.  The effect  of  imprisonment  on  whether  a  citizen  of  the
         European Union has acquired enhanced regulation  21(4)  status  has
         been considered by the Court of Justice of the European Union  when
         considering the 2004 Directive  in  a  number  of  cases  including

         decision of the Upper Tribunal in Arranz v Secretary of  State  for
         the Home Department [2017] UKUT 294 .

         12.  The following propositions were common ground before us:

         (1)  the 10 year period referred to in regulation 21(4) is  counted
         back from the date of the decision to deport, see MG (Portugal)  at
         paragraph 24, Warsame at paragraph 10 and FV (Italy)  at  paragraph
         65;

         (2)  the 10 year period has to be a continuous period of  residence
         in the United Kingdom, see MG (Portugal) at paragraph  25  although
         this does not prevent some absences provided  that  there  has  not
         been  a  transfer  of  "the  centre  of  the  personal,  family  or
         occupational interests of the person concerned";

         (3)  periods of imprisonment  will,  in  principle,  interrupt  the
         continuity of residence for the 10 year period, see  MG  (Portugal)
         at paragraph 36 and FV (Italy) at paragraph 70. This is because the
         imposition of a prison  sentence  showed  non-compliance  with  the
         values expressed by the society of the host  member  state  in  its
         criminal law, see Onuekwere at paragraph 26; but

         (4)  if a citizen of the European Union has resided for 10 years in
         the relevant state before the period of  imprisonment  the  earlier
         period "together with the  other  factors  going  to  make  up  the
         entirety of the relevant considerations in  each  individual  case"
         may be taken into account in determining  whether  the  person  has
         regulation 21(4) status, see MG (Portugal) at paragraph 36  and  FV
         (Italy) at paragraph 71;

         (5)  integration is based not only  on  "territorial  and  temporal
         factors but also on qualitative elements, relating to the level  of
         integration  in  the  host  member  state",  see  paragraph  25  of
         Onuekwere and account should be taken of the following criteria  to
         consider whether integrative links have been broken including  "how
         the penalty is enforced; consideration of  the  offence  committed;
         general behaviour while in detention; acceptance and completion  of
         treatment;  work;  participation  in  educational  and   vocational
         programmes; participation in the enforcement of the  sentence;  and
         maintenance of personal and family ties in the host member  state",
         see paragraph 123 of the Advocate General's opinion as approved  by
         the judgment of the Court at paragraph 73 in FV (Italy); and

         (6)  the cases where there has been a  prior  period  of  10  years
         residence and then a period of imprisonment in the lead up  to  the
         decision to deport have, for purposes of regulation  21(4)  status,
         been referred to as "a maybe category of  cases",  see  Warsame  at
         paragraph 9."

Analysis

30. It is now settled that the relevant period of  10  years  residence  in
    accordance with  the  Regulations  required  for  'imperative  grounds'
    protection under Regulation 27(4) runs backwards from the  decision  to
    deport, in this case, from 13 February 2008 to 13 February  2018.   The
    claimant was a minor for the first three years, so  he  needs  to  show
    that one or both of his parents were exercising Treaty  rights  between
    2008 and 2011.  In  her  supplementary  letter  of  October  2018,  the
    Secretary of State  accepted  that  she  had  seen  evidence  that  the
    claimant's father worked from 2006-2009, when he became medically unfit
    to work.  In 2009, the claimant  was  16  years  old.   There  is  some
    evidence that the claimant's mother worked for Beauty Forever Cosmetics
    Limited in 2009, and that she paid National Insurance contributions  as
    a self-employed person in 2011.

31. I am not satisfied that the evidence before me shows  that  during  the
    whole  period  of  his  minority  (2005  to  2011)  the  claimant   has
    demonstrated that his parents were  exercising  Treaty  rights  in  the
    United Kingdom and that therefore he also was here 'in accordance  with
    the Regulations' for all of those years.

32. The claimant reached the age of 18 on 13 June 2011  and  thereafter  he
    needs to show that he personally was in the United  Kingdom  exercising
    Treaty rights as an EEA national.  The claimant had a drug use problem,
    using cannabis every day at a cost of about �20,  and  tested  positive
    for Spice in prison.  He needed to finance  his  drug  use,  either  by
    family handouts or criminality.  His criminal history does not  suggest
    that he was  economically  active  continuously  after  that  date,  or
    exercising Treaty rights in some different fashion.   His  evidence  is
    that sometimes he worked in his brother's  clinic,  and  sometimes  his
    brother just gave him money.

33. The claimant has not satisfied me that before his conviction  in  2017,
    he can show that he was in the United Kingdom 'in accordance  with  the
    Regulations' for a period of 10 continuous years.   My primary  finding
    is that the integration requirement of Regulation  27(4)  is  not  made
    out.

34. In the alternative, if the claimant had resided in the  United  Kingdom
    for 10 years 'in accordance  with  the  Regulations'  at  the  date  of
    conviction,  the  period  of  one  year  between  conviction  and   the
    deportation order would normally break that integration.  I am required
    to consider the offence  committed;  his  general  behaviour  while  in
    detention; his acceptance and completion of  treatment;  work  (or  its
    absence);  participation  in  educational  and  vocational  programmes;
    participation in the enforcement of the sentence;  and  maintenance  of
    personal and family ties in the host member state.

35. The offence in this case was a serious  one:  street  drug  trafficking
    causes significant harm in the community and was  punished  by  a  long
    sentence with only a small discount for  his  late  guilty  plea.   The
    claimant did take the educational opportunities offered  in  detention.
    However, he was not well behaved in prison.  He had  a  total  of  five
    adjudications, two for  having  an  unauthorised  USB  stick,  one  for
    violence, one for refusing to follow orders by a  prison  officer,  and
    one for failing a drug test.

36. The claimant has no employment history apart from working  occasionally
    in his brother's clinic. His family ties  have  been  weakened  by  his
    offending behaviour.  His brother  has  been  a  loyal  supporter,  his
    relationship with his father and step-mother have improved  with  time,
    but his relationship with his mother remains fragile.   His family ties
    did not prevent him offending before he went to  prison  and  there  is
    nothing which satisfies me that they would do so now.

37. The claimant did accrue 10  years'  residence  in  the  United  Kingdom
    before the offence of which he was convicted, putting him in the 'maybe
    category' case: see Warsame.  However, the evidence that such residence
    was 'in accordance with the Regulations' is weak and discontinuous.

38. On the facts of this appeal, I am satisfied that  whatever  integration
    the claimant had achieved between 2005  and  2015  was  broken  by  his
    imprisonment in 2017.  Applying the decision of the Court of Appeal  in
    Terzaghi, the claimant is therefore not entitled to  claim  'imperative
    grounds'  protection  under  Regulation  27(4),  but  only  the  lesser
    protection in Regulation 27(3).

39. The Upper Tribunal's guidance in MC  (Essa  principles  recast)  [2015]
    UKUT  520  (IAC)  (11  September  2015)  is  relevant  to  whether  the
    claimant's  removal  to  the  Netherlands  is  disproportionate.    The
    claimant's family ties did not prevent him from committing all  of  the
    offences set out in the history above, nor is there any  evidence  that
    the support of a probation officer would not be available to him in the
    Netherlands.

40. Having regard to all of the matters set out in Regulation 27(5),  I  do
    find that the claimant continues to  present  a  genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests
    of society, taking into account his past conduct and  that  the  threat
    does not need to be imminent.  I have regard to  the  OASys  assessment
    that he presents a 61% risk of reoffending.  Protection of  the  public
    from drug  dealing,  particularly  a  Class  A  drug  such  as  heroin,
    unarguably qualifies as 'serious grounds of public  policy  and  public
    security'.

41. On the totality  of  the  evidence  before  me,  I  consider  that  the
    claimant's removal to the Netherlands is not disproportionate and  that
    the Secretary of State was entitled to make  a  deportation  order,  in
    order to protect the fundamental interests of United Kingdom society.

42. The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed and I substitute a  decision
    dismissing the claimant's appeal.



DECISION

43. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law.

    I set aside the previous decision.  I remake the decision by dismissing
    the claimant's appeal.
