   R (on the application of Wasif)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
   Department (rule 34 - "print and send") IRJ [2015] UKUT 0270 (IAC)


                               Upper Tribunal


                       Immigration and Asylum Chamber


                       Judicial Review Decision Notice






             In the matter of an application for judicial review

                       The Queen on the application of

                            Malik Muhammad Wasif
                                                                   Applicant

                                      v

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent





     Before The Honourable Mr Justice McCloskey, President of the Upper
                                  Tribunal






  On  this  substantive  application  for  judicial  review  and  following
  consideration of the documents lodged by the parties and having heard  Mr
  M Read, of Counsel, instructed by Adamsons Law, Solicitors on  behalf  of
  the Applicant and Mr S Skinner, of Counsel, instructed by the  Government
  Legal Department on behalf of the Respondent at a hearing  at  Manchester
  Civil Justice Centre on 08 April 2015




    i) An application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom must  comply
       with the requirements of paragraph A34 and all material provisions of
       paragraphs 34A - 34K of the Immigration Rules.


   ii) Between June 2013 and August 2014, Tier 4 applicants had  the  choice
       of submitting their applications either on line or by the "Print  and
       Send" mechanism.


  iii) The correct construction of the Rules is as follows:


       a) The  first  of  these  options  required  the  submission  of  the
          completed  application  form  on   line  and  the   provision   of
          supporting documents by post.


       b) The second option, "Print and Send",  required  the  applicant  to
          print  the  completed  application  form   and   send   it,   with
          accompanying supporting documents, by post.  The "Print and  Send"
          instruction does not amount to an on-line application.


   iv) A failure to comply with the requirements in 34A (per paragraph  34C)
       invalidates the application.




                                  Judgment

                        Handed down on 22 April 2015



     1. The Applicant is a national of  Pakistan,  aged  31  years.   On  03
        October  2012  he  entered  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  student  in
        accordance with a visa issued by  the  Respondent,  valid  until  28
        February 2014.  Later, he made a combined  application  for  further
        leave to remain as a Tier 4  (General)  Student  Migrant  under  the
        Points  Based  System  and  a  Biometric  Residence  Permit.    This
        application was refused by the Respondent's decision dated 24  March
        2014.


     2. In the refusal decision the Respondent stated that the Applicant had
        failed to demonstrate possession of the requisite level of funds  in
        respect of  the  relevant  period,  28  days.    As  a  result,  the
        Applicant was awarded no points for "maintenance (funds)" and failed
        accordingly since, under the  Immigration  Rules,  ten  points  were
        necessary.  As  regards  the  other  requirement  of  "attributes  -
        Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies", the Applicant  was  awarded
        the full score of 30 points. The key passage in the decision is  the
        following:


             "As the closing date  of  the  bank  statements  submitted  in
             support of your application is 01 March 2014, you need to show
             evidence of �7200 maintenance for 28  days  from  01  February
             2014 to  28  February  2014.  However,  your  bank  statements
             demonstrate that  you  are  in  possession  of  no  more  than
             �1850.94 at any point during that period.  As such,  you  have
             not demonstrated that you have the level of funds  requirement
             ....."


        The application was refused accordingly.


     3. This is a classic legality judicial review challenge.   The  central
        issue is whether the Respondent's decision is in accordance with the
        relevant provisions  of  the  Immigration  Rules  (hereinafter  "the
        Rules").  Nothing turns on  any  of  the  provisions  in  the  self-
        contained  regime  governing  Tier  4  applications  constituted  by
        paragraph 245ZX and Appendix C of the Rules.  Rather, the lawfulness
        of the Respondent's decision depends upon the  correct  construction
        of paragraph A34 of the Rules.  It is necessary to reproduce this in
        full and, for convenience, I have done so in an appendix hereto.


     4. What are the material facts?  These are in some doubt,  largely  due
        to evident uncertainty on the part of  the  Applicant.   When  these
        proceedings were initiated in June 2014, the claim did  not  include
        any witness statement of the Applicant.  This is regrettable,  since
        the present case was crying out for one: see,  in  this  context,  R
        (Mahmood) v Secretary  of State for the Home Department  IJR  [2014]
        UKUT 439 (IAC) at [19] - [23].  Permission  to  apply  for  judicial
        review was then  refused  on  the  papers.   In  October  2014,  the
        Applicant applied for an  oral  hearing.   Still  no  statement  was
        provided.  The oral renewal hearing  was  listed  before  me  on  21
        January 2015.  An adjournment ensued,  to  enable  both  parties  to
        comply with certain directions.  The Applicant was directed to lodge
        and  serve  a  comprehensive  witness  statement  within  21   days.
        Simultaneously, I relisted the hearing to take place on 04  February
        2015.  On the date of the relisting, the  Applicant  had  failed  to
        comply with this direction and no acceptable  explanation  for  this
        failure was available.  The  Applicant  was  given  a  substantially
        extended opportunity for compliance, largely due to the  unscheduled
        rearrangement of the hearing of 04 February 2015 to 18  March  2015.
        On  this  latter  date,  the  Applicant's  failure  continued.    No
        satisfactory explanation was provided.  Having  indicated  the  real
        risk of a wasted costs order, a  generous  further  adjournment  was
        granted, with time extended to 27 March 2015.  The Tribunal received
        the Applicant's purported compliance with the January 2014 direction
        at the relisted hearing on 08 April 2015, again well out of time and
        without any explanation. This  is  unacceptable  and  disturbing.  I
        shall revisit the issue of wasted costs presently.


     5.  Against  this  highly  unsatisfactory   background,   two   witness
        statements in  the  Applicant's  name  were  provided.   The  first,
        unsigned and undated, contains the following averments, in [6]:


             "On 28 February 2014, I made an online application  for  leave
             to remain ....  and paid associated fee online after  which  I
             was advised to post all my official and  supporting  documents
             to UK Visas and  Immigration  within  15  days  of  my  online
             application ....


             On the very next day  on  01  March  2014,  I  posted  all  my
             documents to the UK  Visas  and  Immigration  along  with  the
             downloaded application form with my signatures."


        The second version of  the  Applicant's  statement,  which  is  both
        signed and dated, embodies a very different account [6]:


             "On 28 February 2014, I completed an  online  application  for
             leave to remain ....  and paid  associated  fee  online  after
             which the last step was to 'print and subject online'.  It was
             to my understanding that this meant once I have  submitted  my
             application it will send to the Home Office and I will receive
             a copy of the application for my own records.  After  clicking
             'print and submit online' I received an email  from  the  Home
             Office stating that my application has been accepted.   I  was
             advised to post all my official and supporting documents to UK
             Visas and Immigration within 5 days of my online application."


        To summarise:


        i) The key averments in  the  Applicant's  witness  statements  are
           significantly different.


       ii) No explanation of how this came about was proffered.


      iii) The Home Office  email  mentioned  in  the  longer  of  the  two
           versions was not exhibited, again without explanation.


     6. The Respondent's compliance with the Tribunal's  initial  directions
        of January 2014 confirms that the copy of the Applicant's  completed
        application contained in his judicial review papers is reliable  and
        complete.  The Respondent's version of this  document  differs  from
        the Applicant's in two respects only: it  contains  the  Applicant's
        photograph, stapled to the first page and it also has a copy of  the
        Royal Mail stamp.  In the completed application  the  following  are
        the material passages:


         a) The "date completed" is stated to be 28 February 2014.


         b)  The  "date  charged"  of  the  credit  card  payment  of   the
            application fee, �406, is also stated to be 28 February 2014.


         c) On the second page, the following statement appears:


            "This is your official document for your application.  You need
            to  submit  this  to  us  by  post  in  order  to   make   your
            application."




         d) On the penultimate page, the Applicant's  manuscript  signature
            is inserted, accompanied by the date, also in manuscript, of 28
            February 2014.


         e) The Applicant formally declared (on page  8)  that  the  amount
            needed to comply with the maintenance  requirement  was  �3980,
            made up of �2380 which he had paid to his sponsor and �1600 for
            himself, both  confirmed  by  the  provision  of  the  relevant
            "specified evidence".


         f) On the final page of the application it is stated:


            "Next steps for your application -


            Collate your supporting documents together and post  them  with
            your official document, within 15 working days, to UK Visas and
            Immigration .......... [at specified address]."


     7. The Respondent's case on the relevant factual issues has  been  made
        at three stages: first, in the response to the  pre-action  protocol
        letter; second, in the Acknowledgement of Service; and, third, in  a
        witness statement provided following the  Tribunal's  directions  of
        January  2015.   At  each  of  these  stages,  the  Respondent   has
        consistently made the case that the Applicant  did  not  submit  his
        application online.  Rather, it is claimed, his application, in  its
        entirety, was submitted by post.   Further,  the  application,  with
        supporting documents, was received by the  Respondent  on  01  March
        2014.  The latter,  the  Respondent  contends,  is,  therefore,  the
        operative date.  The Respondent  accepts,  in  substance,  that  the
        Applicant made the requisite payment online, on 28 February 2014.


     8. I resolve the factual issues which have arisen in the following way.
         The Applicant asserts that he "submitted" his application online on
        28 February 2014.  I reject this  assertion.  The  onus  is  on  the
        Applicant to make good this assertion and he must do so to the civil
        standard viz on the balance of probabilities. I  find  that  he  has
        failed to discharge  this  burden  on  account  of  the  unexplained
        discrepancies between his unsigned witness statement and his  signed
        witness statement; the unsatisfactory and incomplete description  in
        the witness statements of what  he  actually  did  on  the  relevant
        occasion; the failure to exhibit the  email  from  the  Home  Office
        allegedly confirming acceptance of the application;  the absence  of
        any  explanation  for  this  failure;  the  lack   of   detail   and
        particularity  in  the  initial  judicial  review  application;  the
        related absence of a satisfactory witness statement, then or at  any
        time  subsequently;  and  the  consistent   terms   in   which   the
        Respondent's case has been formulated.


     9. To summarise, the facts which I find are the following:


         a) On 28 February 2014, the Applicant made the  requisite  payment
            of �406 online.


         b) On the same date, he completed his  application  electronically
            and downloaded it,  following  which  he  manually  signed  the
            document and inserted the date.


         c) In the electronic exercise described immediately above, at  the
            stage when the Applicant had completed his application on line,
            the instruction "PRINT AND SEND" was displayed.


         d) The Applicant obeyed this instruction  by  downloading/printing
            the completed application and, on the  same  date,  posting  it
            accompanied by the  appropriate  supporting  documents  to  the
            Respondent. Notably, there is an unchallenged averment  in  the
            Respondent's affidavit that the completed application posted by
            the Applicant included manuscript alterations.


         e) On 01  March  2014,  the  Respondent  received  the  downloaded
            application and supporting documents.


    10. For completeness, I record that the witness  statement  provided  on
        behalf of the Respondent explains, in some detail, the background to
        and rationale of the introduction of the "print and  send"  optional
        mechanism for Tier 4 applications, stimulated by Basnet (validity of
        application - respondent) [2012] UKUT 00113 (IAC); the success which
        this mechanism experienced; the  subsequent  introduction,  in  June
        2013,  of  the  online  application  mechanism;   the   simultaneous
        withdrawal of the "original application" mechanism; and the ultimate
        abandonment of the "print and send" mechanism in  2014.   In  short,
        between June 2013 and August 2014 Tier 4 applicants had a choice  of
        the "print and  send"  option  and  the  "online"  option.  This  is
        interesting background information which enhances and  augments  the
        Tribunal's understanding of the broader landscape.  However, I  make
        clear that the construction of the relevant provisions of the  Rules
        is a pure question of law, uninfluenced and  unilluminated  by  this
        evidence.


    11. The legal principles governing the exercise of construing  paragraph
        A34 of the Rules are uncontentious. In Mahad (And  Others)  v  Entry
        Clearance  Officer  [2009]  UKSC  16,  Lord  Brown,  collating   and
        summarising earlier dicta of the Court of Appeal, stated, at [10]:


             "Essentially it comes to  this.   The  Rules  are  not  to  be
             construed  with  all  the   strictness   applicable   to   the
             construction of a  statute  or  a  statutory  instrument  but,
             instead,  sensibly  according  to  the  natural  and  ordinary
             meaning  of  the  words  used,  recognising  that   they   are
             statements of the Secretary of State's  administrative  policy
             .....


             [The intention of the Secretary of State] is to  be  discerned
             objectively from the language used, not divined  by  reference
             to  supposed  policy  considerations.   Still  less   is   the
             Secretary of State's  intention  to  be  discovered  from  the
             Immigration   Directorates    Instructions    (IDIs)    issued
             intermittently  to  guide  immigration   officers   in   their
             application of the rules ....  pursuant to paragraph  1(3)  of
             Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act ....."


        Furthermore, the process of rewriting any  provision  of  the  Rules
        under the guise of purposive construction is a forbidden one:  Iqbal
        (And Others) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2015]
        EWCA Civ 169 at [31].   It  is  also  an  established  principle  of
        statutory interpretation, the Court  will  lean  against  an  absurd
        construction where the words in  question  can  bear  the  preferred
        alternative meaning: Lewis v Eliades [2004] 1 WLR  692,  at  [58]  -
        [61], per Jacob LJ.  Finally, the Court:


              "....  cannot  and  should  not  construe  the  Secretary  of
              State's Rules to mean something different  from  what,  on  a
              fair objective reading, they actually say."


              [Iqbal at [33]].


    12. The "print and send" mechanism was first introduced in the Rules  in
        October 2012.  I have, for convenience, reproduced in  the  Appendix
        to this judgment the version of paragraph  A34  of  the  Immigration
        Rules which governed the Applicant's  application  at  the  material
        time (it has been superseded subsequently).  Giving  effect  to  the
        above principles  I construe this as follows:


         i) The opening paragraph establishes, in unambiguous language, two
            options: the applicant is  to  either  complete  "the  relevant
            online application process" in accordance with the requirements
            of paragraph A34(iii) or make use of "the specified application
            form" in accordance with paragraphs 34A - 34D.


        Option 1


        ii) The first option requires the application to be  made  via  the
            UKBA  website,  in  accordance   with   the   process   therein
            stipulated.  This requires the applicant to, inter alia, select
            the appropriate "immigration category".


       iii) Invocation of the online option requires any specific fee to be
            paid in accordance with the "method specified".


        iv) Invocation of the online application  option  clearly  requires
            the completed application  to  be  submitted  on  line  by  the
            relevant date.


         v) Where the online application option is selected,  the  Rule  is
            unequivocal in the requirement relating  to  the  provision  of
            "supporting documents":  these must be submitted  by  post  "in
            the specified manner within 15 working days  of  submission  of
            the online application".


        vi) Where the online application option is selected,  the  sanction
            for  non-compliance   with   the   relevant   requirements   is
            unambiguous: the application "... will be invalid  if  it  does
            not comply with the requirements of paragraph A34(iii) and will
            not be considered."


        Option 2


       vii) Where the second of the two options offered  is  selected,  the
            "specified application form" must be used and completed.   This
            is accessed via the UKBA website.


      viii) In this event, the appropriate fee must be paid in  the  manner
            prescribed.


        ix) The specified types of information must be provided.


         x)  The  completed  application  must  be   accompanied   by   the
            photographs  and  documents  specified  as  mandatory  in   the
            application form and/or related guidance  notes  and  the  form
            must be signed by the applicant.


        xi) Transmission of the completed application form, accompanied  by
            the stipulated photographs and documents, must be  by  pre-paid
            post to UKBA or in person at a public enquiry office  of  UKBA,
            subject only to the exceptions listed.


       xii) Where the "Print and Send" option is selected, the sanction for
            non-compliance with the relevant requirements  is  unambiguous:
            the application "... will be invalid if it does not comply with
            the  requirements  of  paragraph  A34(iii)  and  will  not   be
            considered."


    13. The argument advanced on behalf of the Applicant was that the "print
        and send" instruction generates confusion and ambiguity.  I find  no
        merit in this contention.  This instruction, in my view, would  have
        conveyed unambiguously to the hypothetical reasonably attentive  and
        informed student the necessity of (i) printing the application  form
        completed on line and, thereafter, (ii) sending it to the Respondent
        in the manner summarised above viz in accordance with paragraph  34B
        of the Rules.  Giving  effect  to  the  principles  of  construction
        summarised in [11] and my view of the correct  construction  of  the
        Rule in [12], I conclude that the Applicant's challenge to the  Rule
        must fail.   Regrettable  though  many  "near  miss"  cases  are,  I
        consider this conclusion unavoidable.


    14. I further reject  the  Applicant's  second,  alternative  ground  of
        challenge.  The contention that the Respondent had a  discretion  to
        waive the non-compliance with the Rules finds no support  in  either
        the terms of  the  Rules  themselves  or  any  legal  principle.  No
        authority in support of this ground was cited.   The  Applicant  has
        failed to establish that any discretion exists.  Thus  the  further,
        separate question of whether discretion should have  been  exercised
        in the Applicant's favour does not arise.


    15. Tribunals and  practitioners  should  be  alert  to  two  subsequent
        changes in the Rules.  First, in June 2013, an  on-line  application
        mechanism was introduced, co-existing  with  the  "print  and  send"
        option.  This  change  was  motivated  by  perceived  administrative
        advantages.  Second, in August 2014, the "print and send" option was
        removed.   From  that  date  the  on-line  application  became   the
        exclusive mechanism.


        Order


    16. Giving effect to the above analysis and conclusions:


        i) The application for judicial review is dismissed.


       ii) Subject to any representations to the contrary within 14 days of
           the date hereof, the Applicant will pay the Respondent's  costs,
           to be assessed in default of agreement.


      iii) I refuse permission to apply to the Court of Appeal  since  this
           decision has involved a relatively straightforward  exercise  of
           construing the relevant provisions of the Immigration Rules  and
           gives rise to no general point of law of importance.

             The Honourable Mr Justice McCloskey

         Notification of appeal rights


        A decision by the Upper Tribunal  on  an  application  for  judicial
        review is a decision that disposes of proceedings.


        A party may appeal against such a decision to the Court of Appeal on
        a question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal should  apply
        to the Upper Tribunal for permission, at the hearing  at  which  the
        decision is given. If no application  is  made,  the  Tribunal  must
        nonetheless consider at  the  hearing  whether  to  give  or  refuse
        permission to appeal (rule 44(4B) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
        Tribunal) Rules 2008).


        If the  Tribunal  refuses  permission,  either  in  response  to  an
        application or by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party  wishing  to
        appeal can apply for permission from the  Court  of  Appeal  itself.
        This must be done by filing an appellant's  notice  with  the  Civil
        Appeals Office of the Court of Appeal within 28 days of the date the
        Tribunal's  decision  on  permission  to  appeal  was  given  (Civil
        Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3(2)).





                                  APPENDIX

Variation of Applications or Claims for Leave to Remain

34E.  If a person wishes to vary the purpose of an application or claim  for
      leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  and  an  application  form  is
      specified for such new purpose or paragraph A34 applies, the variation

      (as they apply at the date the variation is made) as if the  variation
      were a new application or claim, or the variation will be invalid  and
      will not be considered.

34F   Any valid variation of a leave to remain application will  be  decided
      in accordance with the immigration rules in force  at  the  date  such
      variation is made.

Determination of the date of an application or claim  (or  variation  of  an
application or claim) in connection with immigration

34G   For the purposes of these rules, the date on which an  application  or
      claim (or a variation in accordance with paragraph 34E) is made is  as
      follows:

      (i)   where the application form is sent by post, the date of posting,




      (ii)  where the application form is submitted in person, the  date  on
           which it is accepted by a public enquiry office  of  the  United
           Kingdom Border Agency of the Home Office,


      (iii) where the application form is sent by courier, the date on which
           it is delivered to the United Kingdom Border Agency of the  Home
           Office, or


      (iv)  where  the  application  is  made  via  the  online  application
           process,  on  the  date  on  which  the  online  application  is
           submitted.

34H.  Applications or claims for leave to remain  made  before  29  February
      2008 for which a form was prescribed prior to 29 February  2008  shall
      be subject to the forms and procedures as in  force  on  the  date  on
      which the application or claim was made.

34I.  Where an application or claim is made no more than 21 days  after  the
      date on which a form is specified under the immigration rules and on a
      form that was permitted for  such  application  or  claim  immediately
      prior to the date of such  specification,  the  application  or  claim
      shall be deemed to have been made on the specified form.

Withdrawn applications or claims for leave to remain in the United Kingdom

34J.  Where a person whose application or  claim  for  leave  to  remain  is
      being considered requests the return of his passport for  the  purpose
      of travel outside the common travel area, the  application  for  leave
      shall, provided it has not already  been  determined,  be  treated  as
      withdrawn as soon as the passport is  returned  in  response  to  that
      request.

34K.  Paragraph 34J does not apply to an applicant  who  is  applying  as  a
      Tier 2 Migrant or a Tier 5 Migrant and whose application is  supported
      by a Certificate of Sponsorship from a Premium Sponsor.

Undertakings

35.   A sponsor of a person seeking leave to enter or remain in  the  United
      Kingdom may  be  asked  to  give  an  undertaking  in  writing  to  be
      responsible for  that  person's  maintenance,  accommodation  and  (as
      appropriate) personal care  for  the  period  of  any  leave  granted,
      including any further variation or for a period of 5 years  from  date
      of grant where indefinite leave to enter or remain is  granted.  Under
      the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and  the  Social  Security
      Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992, the Department  of  Social
      Security or, as the case may be, the Department of Health  and  Social
      Services in Northern Ireland, may seek  to  recover  from  the  person
      giving such an undertaking any income support paid to meet  the  needs
      of the person in respect of whom the undertaking has been given. Under
      the Immigration and Asylum Act  1999  the  Home  Office  may  seek  to
      recover  from  the  person  giving   such   an   undertaking   amounts
      attributable  to  any  support  provided  under  section  95  of   the
      Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (support for asylum seekers) to, or in
      respect of, the person in respect of whom  the  undertaking  has  been
      given. Failure by the sponsor to maintain that  person  in  accordance
      with the undertaking, may also be an offence under section 105 of  the
      Social Security Administration Act 1992 and/or under  section  108  of
      the Immigration and Asylum Act  1999  if,  as  a  consequence,  asylum
      support and/or income support is provided to, or in respect  of,  that
      person.
