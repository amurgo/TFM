                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Atkinson made following a hearing at Bradford on 4th November 2014.

Background

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 30th  January  1989.   He
    arrived in the UK on 17th March 2011 with leave as  a  Tier  4  Student
    which was subsequently extended until  14th  December  2014.   On  23rd
    October 2013 he applied for leave to remain as a spouse but was refused
    on the grounds that he did not  meet  the  suitability  criteria.   The
    Secretary of State  believed  that  he  had  engaged  in  deception  in
    obtaining an English language certificate from ETS in July 2012.

 3. The judge found that the evidence relied upon by the Secretary of State
    was insufficient to discharge the burden of proof upon her to establish
    deception and allowed the appeal.

 4. Prior to the hearing I was informed by the  claimant's  representatives
    that he had left the UK and that they had told the Secretary  of  State
    of his departure in February 2015.

 5. The Immigration Act  2014,  in  Section  17(8)  states  that  where  an
    appellant brings an appeal from within the UK but leaves the UK  before
    the appeal is finally  determined  the  appeal  is  to  be  treated  as
    abandoned unless the  claim  to  which  the  appeal  relates  has  been
    certified under Section 94(1) or (7) or Section 94B.

 6. This  mirrors  the  provisions  in  Section  104  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 7. An appeal under Section  82(1)  is  not  finally  determined  for  this
    purpose while:

      a) an application for permission to appeal under Section 11 or  13  of
         the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 could be made or  is
         awaiting determination;

      b) permission to appeal  under  either  of  those  Sections  has  been
         granted and the appeal is awaiting determination, or

      c) an appeal has been remitted under Section 12 or 14 of that Act  and
         is awaiting determination.

 8. Accordingly, the claimant's appeal against the refusal by the Secretary
    of State to refuse his application for leave to  remain  is  abandoned.
    It has not yet been finally determined because the Secretary  of  State
    exercised her right to challenge the First-tier  Judge's  determination
    and he left the UK whilst that challenge was pending, albeit  that  the
    exact date of his departure is unknown.

Notice of Decision

 9. Appeal abandoned.

10. No anonymity direction is made.
