Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr Z Nasim, Counsel, Milestone Chambers
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants, who are husband and wife, appeal to the Upper  Tribunal
    from the decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing  their  appeals
    against the decision by the respondent to refuse to vary their leave to
    remain in the United Kingdom in the capacity (in the case of the  first
    appellant) of a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant and (in the case  of  the
    second appellant) as a PBS dependant.  The first appellant is the  main
    appellant in this appeal, and I shall hereafter refer to him simply  as
    the appellant, save where the context otherwise requires.   The  First-
    tier Tribunal did not  make  an  anonymity  direction,  and  I  do  not
    consider that the appellant requires anonymity for these proceedings in
    the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant made his application for leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant on 12 May 2014.  He had previously been  granted
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant on 14 April 2012,
    and his leave to remain in this capacity expired on 14 April 2014.   In
    his application form, he said he was relying  on  a  bank  letter  from
    Habib Bank Limited (HBL) which said that he had access to �500,754.40.

 3. The appellant  did  not  provide  an  original  bank  letter  with  the
    application.  He provided a scanned copy of a letter from HBL dated  14
    April 2014.  The bank confirmed that the third party funder,  Mr  Khan,
    had an available balance of 8,2000,000 Pakistani rupees (equivalent  to
    more than �50,000) in his personal account held at the branch, and this
    amount  was  available  to  his  family  friend,  the  appellant,   for
    investment in the United Kingdom.

 4. On 25 April 2014 the Home Office  sent  an  e-mail  to  the  appellant,
    thanking him for his application, which was currently being considered.
     They had identified omissions with regard to  the  evidence  that  had
    been submitted.  The scanned copy of a bank letter from Habib Bank  for
    account number ending  5102  had  been  provided  as  access  to  funds
    evidence.  As per paragraph 41-SD(c)(i)(1) of Appendix A of the  Rules,
    the Home Office required the original.

 5. He was asked to provide

       . an original bank letter from the financial institution holding  the
         funds;

       . an original written declaration from the third party that had  made
         money available to invest in a business in the United Kingdom;

       . a letter from legal representatives in relation to his third  party
         funds;

       . maintenance evidence covering the period 1 April to 14 April 2014.

 6. Pursuant  to  this  request,  the  appellant  provided  a  third  party
    declaration dated 28 April 2014 and a letter from SHN Solicitors  dated
    28 April 2014.

 7. He also provided an original bank letter from HBL dated 14 April  2014,
    but the letter was not the original of the  scanned  letter  which  had
    been provided with the  application.   In  addition  to  some  spelling
    errors  being  corrected,  the  available  balance  was  said   to   be
    8,208,100.00 Pakistani rupees and a different e-mail address was  given
    for the third party funder.  Whereas his e-mail address in the  scanned
    e-mail was raznad@icloud.com, his e-mail address in the new bank letter
    was raznas-star@hotmail.com.

 8. In a statutory declaration made on 28 April 2014 Mr Khan said  that  he
    had an available balance of 8,200,000 Pakistani rupees  (equivalent  to
    �50,754 as per conversion) in his personal account  number  held  at  a
    branch of HBL in Faisalabad, and  this  amount  was  available  to  the
    appellant for the business he ran in the United Kingdom.

 9. On 12 May 2014  the  respondent  gave  her  reasons  for  refusing  the
    appellant's application.  He stated he had access to funds  of  �50,000
    being made available to him/his business by a third party, Mr Khan.  As
    evidence of this he had provided:

      i) a scanned bank letter from HBL dated 14 April 2014;

     ii) an original bank letter from HBL dated 14 April 2014;

    iii) a declaration from Mr Khan;

     iv) a letter from a legal representative.

10. However, the bank letters he had provided were not  acceptable  because
    they provided contradictory evidence.  He was  asked  for  an  original
    bank letter from the financial institution holding the funds.  The Home
    Office had received by post on 6 May 2014 an original bank letter.  But
    although the bank letters were  dated  on  the  same  day,  there  were
    discrepancies in the detail.  The respondent went on to  enumerate  the
    discrepancies, including the ones which I have highlighted above.

11. As he had provided contradictory evidence, in accordance with paragraph
    41 of Appendix A of the Rules he was not considered to have  access  to
    the funds which he claimed to have.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

12. The appellant's appeal came before Judge R J  N  B  Morris  sitting  at
    Richmond Magistrates' Court on 10 March 2015.   Mr  Nasim  appeared  on
    behalf of the appellants, and  the  respondent  was  represented  by  a
    Presenting Officer.

13. In her subsequent decision, the judge set out the appellants'  case  at
    paragraphs 11 to 12, and she set out her findings at paragraphs  13  to
    15.  I reproduce these verbatim below.

         "11. The Appellants states that:-

             (i)  he had not provided  'contradictory  evidence'.   He  was
                  relying on third party funds from  a  family  friend,  Mr.
                  Muhammad Shiraz Khan who held the relevant  funds  in  the
                  Habib Bank Ltd in Pakistan.  There had been a delay in the
                  Appellant receiving the bank documents from Pakistan  and,
                  since he was making his application on the day  his  leave
                  was  due  to  expire,  he  was  advised  to   submit   his
                  application with whatever documentation he had  available.
                  He had  realised  later  that  there  were  some  spelling
                  mistakes in the documents he had sent to the Respondent in
                  support of his application.   This  is  why  he  had  sent
                  additional documentation with his Change of  Circumstances
                  Form;

             (ii) According to the  Appellant,  he  had  sent  the  further
                  documents including the original of the  bank  letters  by
                  his own volition when he noticed the  spelling  errors  in
                  the documentation accompanying  his  application  on  14th
                  April 2014.  He had not  received  the  email  dated  25th
                  April 2014 from the Home Office in which he was  asked  to
                  send the original of the scanned bank letter, until  after
                  he had received the Reasons for Refusal Letter dated  12th
                  May 2014 ("the Reasons for Refusal Letter").  When he  saw
                  that there was a reference to an email in the Reasons  for
                  Refusal Letter, he checked his email inbox and traced  the
                  email from the Home Office to his 'junk' email box;

             (iii)    The Appellant does not  agree  that  there  were  any
                  material inconsistencies between the scanned  bank  letter
                  and  the   alleged   original   of   that   letter.    The
                  discrepancies were attributable to spelling errors and, in
                  the case of the third party's Sponsor's name, it was  very
                  common for the  same  name  to  be  spelt  differently  in
                  Pakistan.  The Respondent  should  have  taken  this  into
                  account.

         12.  It was also submitted  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant  at  the
             hearing that the Decision was not in accordance with  the  law
             or the Immigration Rules.  In addition, the Respondent  had  a
             common law duty to make enquiries and to take reasonable steps
             to ascertain if the Appellant's documents were  false,  before
             she made her Decision.

         Findings

         13.  Having considered all the evidence before me, I find that  the
             Appellants' appeals under paragraphs 245DD and 319C (b) of the
             Rules must fail.  I come to this conclusion for the  following
             reasons:-

             (i)  Appendix A provides that not only must an applicant  meet
                  the requirements of Table 4 of Appendix A, but he  or  she
                  must also provide the 'specified documents'  in  the  form
                  set out in paragraph 41 - SD;

             (ii) the scanned copy of the letter from Habib Bank  Ltd  sent
                  with  the  Appellant's  application  was  refused  by  the
                  Respondent because, contrary to the provisions of Appendix
                  A, he had sent a copy rather  than  the  original  letter.
                  The Respondent did not raise any questions  regarding  the
                  substance of the letter itself.  However,  on  receipt  of
                  the purported original of the  scanned  copy  letter  sent
                  with the Appellant's application, the discrepancies in the
                  information contained in what was  said  to  be  the  same
                  letter were noted by the Respondent;

             (iii)    the Appellant argued both in his  Witness  Statement,
                  and oral  evidence,  and  submissions  were  made  on  his
                  behalf, that the alleged discrepancies were no  more  than
                  spelling mistakes.  Clearly, this  is  not  an  acceptable
                  explanation  because  of  the  varying   nature   of   the
                  discrepancies to which reference is  made.   For  example,
                  the Appellant explains that the third party's  name  could
                  be  spelt   as   'Sheraz'   or   'Shiraz'   in   Pakistan.
                  Accordingly, this  would  appear  not  to  be  a  spelling
                  mistake but an acceptable variation in the spelling of the
                  same name.  However, it cannot be said that the difference
                  in the specified balance in the same account on  the  same
                  day  was  also  attributable  to   a   spelling   mistake.
                  According  to  paragraph  4  of  the  Appellant's  Witness
                  Statement, 'it is clearly evident that the letter  I  sent
                  on 2nd May 2014 was printed later' - that  is  later  than
                  the scanned copy of a letter bearing the same date as  the
                  original  letter  eventually  sent   by   the   Appellant.
                  However, when asked to explain how and why it was  clearly
                  evident that the original letter was  printed  later,  the
                  Appellant was unable to give a satisfactory explanation;

             (iv) spelling mistakes  would  not  explain  why  two  grossly
                  different email addresses were given by the same bank  for
                  the same client, that is Mr.  Muhammad  Shiraz  Khan.   In
                  short, I concluded that on the balance  of  probabilities,
                  the only defect identified  in  the  Reasons  for  Refusal
                  Letter, which is attributable to a spelling error was  the
                  spelling of 'Hounslow'.

         14.  It was asserted that the Respondent was  under  a  common  law
             duty to act fairly.  In this case, this duty  included  making
             further enquiries of the Habib Bank Ltd and also requesting  a
             Document Verification Report.  However,  the  Respondent  gave
             the Appellant the opportunity to  provide  the  original  bank
             letter.   The  queries  raised  by  the  Respondent   were   a
             legitimate enquiry of the  Appellant  as  to  why  there  were
             differences in the two letters.   The  Respondent  has  fallen
             short of asserting that either the scanned copy of the  letter
             from Habib Bank  Ltd  or  its  alleged  original  were  false.
             Instead, the Appellant  was  asked  to  provide  a  reasonable
             explanation for the differences.  However, the  Appellant  has
             not adduced any evidence whatsoever to clarify  the  position.
             It was open to him to obtain a letter from Habib Bank  Ltd  to
             explain the differences, but he has not done so, and  instead,
             he has relied on his own speculation as to the order in  which
             the letters were printed.  Moreover, even if they were printed
             at different times, they were printed on the same day  and  in
             the absence of any other information to substantiate his claim
             that the balances reflected the third party Sponsor's  balance
             at different times on the same day, I am not  satisfied  that,
             on the balance of probabilities, the  appellant's  explanation
             accounts for the discrepancies in the balances.  I  find  that
             the Respondent has discharged her duty to act fairly by giving
             the Appellant the opportunity to explain the  reason  for  the
             defects identified in the Reasons for Refusal Letter.

         15.  The Appellant claims that he had made the Respondent aware  of
             the differences in the bank letters because he had submitted a
             Change of Circumstances Form.  However,  Section  28  of  that
             form  merely  states  that  a  bank  letter,   a   Solicitor's
             Declaration and an Affidavit had been enclosed with the Change
             of Circumstances Form.  There is nothing in that form to  make
             the Respondent aware that the original bank letter was not  in
             fact in the same form as  the  scanned  copy.   Moreover,  the
             Appellant has not adduced any evidence to show that the  email
             sent on behalf of the Respondent on 25th April 2014  had  been
             delivered into his 'junk'  mailbox.   Having  considered  this
             matter in the round and given the nature  of  the  Appellant's
             explanations,  (none  of  which  are  substantiated   by   any
             objective means), I am not satisfied that on  the  balance  of
             probabilities,  the  Appellant  had  been   unaware   of   the
             Respondent's concerns when he submitted the  alleged  original
             letter from Habib Bank Ltd".

14. The judge went on to find that the decision was in accordance with  the
    law and the applicable Rules.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

15. Mr Nasim settled the appellant's application for permission to  appeal,
    and he advanced five grounds.  Ground 1 was that the judge had erred in
    law in stating that the appellant was given the opportunity to  explain
    the reason for the  defects  identified  in  the  Reasons  for  Refusal
    Letter, when in fact he was not.  Ground 2 was that the judge had erred
    in failing to appreciate that the 2002 Act prevented the appellant from
    adducing new evidence.  Ground 3 is indecipherable.  Ground 4 was  that
    the judge had failed to appreciate that there was  no  legal  basis  on
    which the respondent could refuse the application.  Ground 5  was  that
    the judge erred in failing to give regard to the respondent's  duty  to
    investigate further.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

16. On 29 May 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Landes granted  permission  to
    appeal for the following reasons:

         "REASONS FOR DECISION (including any decision on extending time)

         1.   These are in-time applications by the appellants, husband  and
             wife, citizens of India,  for  leave  to  appeal  against  the
             decision of Judge of the First-Tier Tribunal R J  N  B  Morris
             promulgated on 27  March  2015  who  dismissed  their  appeals
             against the respondent's refusal to  grant  further  leave  to
             remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant  and  his  dependant
             respectively.

         2.   I have had some difficulty in reading the handwriting  in  the
             grounds.  In particular I cannot make out the word in ground 3
             before 'in the letters' which may be significant.  Accordingly
             I cannot come to a conclusion whether ground  3  is  arguable.
             Ground 5 does not specify what the respondent should have done
             by way of investigating  further.   I  consider  however  that
             grounds 1, 2 and 4 are arguable as I explain below  and  given
             the decision in Ferrer I do not restrict the grounds which may
             be argued.

         3.   I consider that it is arguable as set out  in  ground  4  that
             there was no legal basis  for  refusing  the  application  and
             therefore that the judge erred in concluding that  there  was.
             The first appellant had produced to the respondent an original
             bank letter, a third party declaration and  a  letter  from  a
             legal representative.  Given that the first appellant had sent
             in a change of circumstances  declaration  pre  decision  with
             these documents (no third party declaration or letter  from  a
             legal representative had been submitted with  the  application
             originally - see respondent's email) it is arguable  that  the
             bank letter did not need to be the same letter as the  scanned
             letter originally sent in order for the rules to be satisfied.
              The respondent did not assert in  the  decision  letter  that
             either the bank letter or the scanned bank letter were  false,
             neither did the respondent say that she was unable  to  verify
             the letters.

         4.   In addition it is arguable that the  judge  erred  in  finding
             that  the  respondent  had  given  the  first  appellant   the
             opportunity to explain the reason for the 'defects' identified
             in the letter (ground 1).  The respondent did not do so as  it
             appears the first mention by the respondent of her contentions
             was in the refusal letter.  It is arguable (ground 2) that for
             the first appellant to give an explanation  post  decision  is
             too late bearing in mind the provisions of section 85A.  It is
             not obvious  that  the  evidence  would  come  within  section
             85(4)(c) as being adduced to prove that the  bank  letter  was
             genuine or valid given the respondent was  not  alleging  that
             the bank letter was a false document or invalid.  These points
             are arguably material as the judge found that  the  respondent
             had discharged a duty  to  act  fairly  by  giving  the  first
             appellant  an  opportunity  to  explain  the  reason  for  the
             'defects' identified".



The Error of Law Hearing

17. At the hearing before me, I reviewed the documents that had been before
    the First-tier Tribunal.  These included the  case  of  Naved  Pakistan
    [2012] UKUT 0014 (IAC), an extract from the Judicial Review Handbook on
    the Points-Based System Migrant and  a  Change  Of  Circumstances  Form
    which the appellant had completed.  I was also  shown  the  appellant's
    witness statement in which the appellant said as follows  at  paragraph
    4:

         "It is unclear how the so-called discrepancies can  result  in  the
         Home Office not accepting the documents.  If there were concerns in
         relation to the documents, all they had to do was contact the  bank
         for verification!  I do not know what the Home Office  mean  by  me
         providing 'contradictory evidence' in accordance with paragraph  41
         of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.  Also I should mention  the
         letters of the same date but it is clearly evident that the  letter
         I sent on 2 May 2014 was printed later".

18. I observed that the appellant thereby appeared to be conceding that the
    original  bank  letter  had  been  produced  after   14   April   2014,
    notwithstanding the fact that it bore the date of 14 April  2014.   The
    appellant, who was present, clarified that what he meant  was  that  it
    was printed later the same day.

19. Mr Nasim indicated that his error of law challenge  essentially  boiled
    down to two grounds.  The first ground was that the decision was not in
    accordance with the Rules, as on a proper construction of the Rules the
    appellant had provided  the  specified  evidence.   Alternatively,  the
    judge's reasoning on fairness was flawed, as she ought  to  have  found
    that the decision appealed against was not in accordance with the  law,
    and that a lawful decision on the Tier 1 application was outstanding.

20. On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Melvin relied  on  the  written
    submissions which he had prepared opposing  the  appeal.   The  grounds
    were no more than an expression of disagreement with  the  findings  of
    the judge which were open to him.  No documentary evidence was  offered
    by the appellant for the discrepancies in the two  letters,  which  had
    purportedly been written on the same day, and the oral  evidence  given
    by the appellant was rejected by the  judge.   The  hearing  had  taken
    place ten months after the refusal decision, and so the  appellant  had
    ten months to provide an explanation for the discrepant documents.  Now
    over twelve months had elapsed since the  refusal,  but  he  had  still
    failed to provide an explanation for the discrepant documents.

Discussion

21. Ground 4 in the application for permission  corresponds  to  the  first
    ground advanced by Mr Nasim before me.  The remaining grounds  advanced
    in the application for permission effectively condense into Mr  Nasim's
    new ground 2.

22. It is convenient to deal first with Mr Nasim's new ground 1. If  he  is
    right, there is no need to go any  further.   Mr  Nasim's  argument  on
    ground 1 is supported by Judge Landes' observations.  However, I am not
    persuaded that Judge Morris was wrong to find that the refusal decision
    was in accordance with the Rules.

23. There are two Rules which have a direct bearing on ground 1.  Paragraph
    41-SD(a) states that the specified documents to show  evidence  of  the
    funding available to invest are one or more of the following  specified
    documents:

      i) A letter from each financial  institution  holding  the  funds,  to
         confirm the amount of money available.  Each letter must:

         (1)  be an original document and not a copy,

         ...

         (4)  have been produced within the three months immediately  before
             the date of the application.

24. Paragraph 245AA sets out the circumstances in which  the  Secretary  of
    State will consider documents not submitted with applications under the
    points-based system.  Under subparagraph (a), the  Secretary  of  State
    will  only  consider  documents  that  have  been  submitted  with  the
    application, and will  only  consider  documents  submitted  after  the
    application where they are submitted in  accordance  with  subparagraph
    (b).

25. Subparagraph (b) provides that if the applicant has submitted specified
    documents in which:

         (iii)    a document is a copy and not an original document ...

    the Secretary of State may contact the applicant or his  representative
    in writing, and request correct  documents.   The  requested  documents
    must be received at the address specified in the request  within  seven
    working days of the date of the request.

26. Subparagraph (d)  provides  that  if  the  applicant  has  submitted  a
    specified document:

         (ii) which is a copy and not an original document ...

    the application  may  be  granted  exceptionally,  providing  that  the
    Secretary of State  is  satisfied  that  the  specified  documents  are
    genuine and the applicant meets all the other requirements.

27. The appellant failed to comply with paragraph 41-SD(a) when making  his
    application as he failed to provide an original bank letter.  So, prima
    facie, the Secretary  of  State  could  have  refused  the  application
    without giving the appellant the opportunity to rectify the omission.

28. But the Secretary of State did give the appellant  the  opportunity  to
    rectify the omission.  He was given seven days in which to provide  the
    original of the scanned copy of  the  bank  letter  provided  with  the
    application.   Indisputably,  the  appellant  failed  to  provide   the
    original  version  of  the  scanned  letter,  but  instead  provided  a
    different bank letter, albeit that there was no material difference  in
    substance.

29. Reliance is placed on the fact that the new version of the bank  letter
    had the same date as the old version of the bank letter.  But  even  if
    the date of the new version was taken at its face value (and there were
    good reasons not to take it at its face value), it still fell  foul  of
    the requirement in paragraph 41-SD(a) which was that  the  letter  must
    have been produced "within the three months immediately before the date
    of the application".  The letter was  not  produced  within  the  three
    months immediately before the date of application, but was produced  to
    the Secretary of State some two weeks after the application.  If it had
    been the  original  of  the  scanned  copy,  then  the  requirement  in
    subparagraph (4) would have  been  met.   But  since  it  was  not  the
    original of the scanned copy served with the application,  it  did  not
    meet the requirement of subparagraph (4).  Also, the Secretary of State
    could not take the document into account pursuant to Rule  245AA.   For
    it was not a document that had been submitted with the  application  in
    copy form, so as to enable the original version to be considered on  an
    exceptional basis after the application had been made, pursuant to Rule
    245AA(b).   (Alternatively,  the  appellant  had  not  shown  that  the
    original bank letter was genuine or valid: see below.)

30. I accept that the above points  were  not  teased  out  either  in  the
    refusal letter or in Judge Morris' decision.  But this does not matter.
     The burden rests with the appellant to show that the judge  materially
    erred in law in finding that the decision was in  accordance  with  the
    Rules.  The appellant does not discharge this burden for the reasons  I
    have given.

31. Turning to ground 2, I accept that there are  flaws  in  Judge  Morris'
    analysis.  The appellant was not given the opportunity to  explain  the
    discrepancies between the two bank letters before an  adverse  decision
    was made; and, once the adverse decision had been made, the appellant's
    ability to explain the discrepancies was circumscribed by Section  85A.



32. Under Exception 2, the Tribunal may consider evidence  adduced  by  the
    appellant only if it -

      i) was submitted in support  of,  and  at  the  time  of  making,  the
         application to which the immigration decision related, or

     ii) relates to the appeal insofar as it relies on  grounds  other  than
         those specified in subsection 3(c), or

    iii) is adduced to prove that a document is genuine or valid.

 1. So the judge needed to resolve  whether  Mr  Nasim  was  right  in  his
    submission that, absent an assertion of falsity by the respondent,  the
    appellant was debarred by Section 85A from adducing admissible evidence
    to explain the discrepancies.

 2. However, I am not persuaded that the judge made a material error of law
    in reaching the conclusion that the appellant had not been a victim  of
    common law unfairness, and in her parallel finding  that  the  decision
    was in accordance with the law.

 3. As the judge indicated in  paragraph  14,  there  was  not  common  law
    unfairness in the Naved sense in  that  the  appellant  was  aware,  or
    should have been aware, when providing the  new  version  of  the  bank
    letter that the differences between  the  purported  original  and  the
    purported copy were likely to trigger a legitimate enquiry of him as to
    why there were differences in the two letters.  Ignorance of the  Rules
    is no defence and, as I have analysed earlier  in  this  decision,  the
    appellant was inviting a refusal by failing to provide the original  of
    the scanned copy.  So this is not a case  where  the  eventual  refusal
    decision was based on grounds "of which he did not know and  could  not
    have known".  On the contrary, he knew, or ought to have known, that he
    was inviting trouble by not complying with the request  for  production
    of the original bank letter.

 4. The other argument advanced by Mr Nasim before the First-tier  Tribunal
    was that the respondent ought to have made further enquiries of HBL and
    requested a document verification report in respect of the new  version
    of the bank letter.  But I consider the  premise  which  underlies  his
    submission is fallacious.  The respondent did not need to  assert  that
    the original bank letter  was  false.  By  rejecting  the  bank  letter
    evidence  as  contradictory,  the  respondent  was  placing  upon   the
    appellant the burden of proving  that  the  original  bank  letter  was
    genuine or valid. So it was open to Judge Morris to find, as  she  did,
    that the respondent needed  to  do  no  more  than  to  point  out  the
    differences between the purported original and the scanned copy.

 5. Under paragraph 245AA(d) the burden rested with the appellant  to  show
    that the documents tendered by him were genuine.  It was  only  if  the
    respondent was satisfied that the  specified  documents  provided  were
    genuine, and that the applicant met all the  other  requirements,  that
    the  Secretary  of  State  had  discretion  to  grant  the  application
    exceptionally.

 6. Under the  statute,  the  appellant  was  not  debarred  from  adducing
    evidence by way of appeal to show that the  original  bank  letter  was
    genuine or valid.

 7. Given the respondent's reliance on the discrepancies  between  the  two
    documents as justifying the refusal under the Rules, the burden  rested
    on the appellant to bring forward evidence to show  that  the  original
    letter from HBL was valid or  genuine  by  proving  that  it  had  been
    produced by the bank on 14 April 2014.  (This would not necessarily get
    the appellant home, as a corresponding copy had not been submitted with
    the application.)

 8. As the judge found, the appellant failed to give a credible explanation
    in his oral evidence as to how it could have come to pass that the bank
    would issue on the  same  day  two  different  bank  letters  with  two
    different credit balances.  The appellant's oral evidence was  relevant
    to the issue of whether the original bank  statement  relied  upon  was
    genuine or valid, and so it was evidence that was admissible under  the
    statute.

 9. At paragraph 2 of his witness statement, the  appellant  said  that  he
    sent the documents on 14 April 2014 in a rush. The documents  comprised
    whatever was given to him by his friend Shiraz Khan.  He continued:

         "Later we realised that there were spelling  mistakes  and  I  sent
         further documents with the circumstances changed  form.   The  Home
         Office had referred to the e-mail  they  sent  me  but  it  is  not
         because of the e-mail I sent further documents.  I only saw the  e-
         mail once I had received the refusal letter as it made reference to
         an e-mail but when I looked up my e-mail inbox it was not there but
         in my junk e-mail box".

    The appellant did not disclose any e-mails passing between him  or  his
    friend and HBL on 14 April 2014 making corrections to the scanned  copy
    of the bank letter that had been sent to the respondent.  He  also  did
    not produce evidence to show that the e-mail from the Home  Office  had
    gone straight to his junk  e-mail  box.   Accordingly,  the  judge  was
    entitled to reject the appellant's evidence for the reasons  which  she
    gave.

10. The judge's real error was not to recognise  that  the  effect  of  her
    finding was that the appellant had not discharged the burden of proving
    that the purported original letter from HBL was valid or genuine.

11. But her error is not material,  as  this  finding  is  the  inescapable
    consequence of her rejection of  the  appellant's  unsupported  account
    that the original bank letter was generated on 14 April 2014  -  rather
    than around the same time as the other documents that were served  with
    the Change of Circumstances Form.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  These appeals are dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
