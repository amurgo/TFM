                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by DGF,
Solicitors, Glasgow
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. For  reasons  explained  in  her  decision  dated  19  July  2017,  the
    respondent refused the appellant's protection and human  rights  claims
    and maintained her decision to deport him to Somalia.  He  appealed  to
    the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. FtT Judge Telford dismissed the appellant's appeal by  a  determination
    promulgated on 15 November 2017.

 3. The appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  UT  are  stated  in  his
    application for permission  filed  on  29  November  2017.   Under  the
    heading, "Failing to apply properly or at all MOJ and others (Return to
    Mogadishu) Somalia CG [2014] UKUT 00442" they  set  out  the  following
    from the headnote:

         (ix)     If it is  accepted  that  a  person  facing  a  return  to
         Mogadishu after a period of absence has no nuclear family or  close
         relatives in the city to assist him in re-establishing  himself  on
         return, there will need to be a careful assessment of  all  of  the
         circumstances. These  considerations  will  include,  but  are  not
         limited to:


                . circumstances in Mogadishu before departure;


                . length of absence from Mogadishu;


                . family or clan associations to call upon in Mogadishu;


                . access to financial resources;


                . prospects  of  securing  a  livelihood,  whether  that  be
                  employment or self employment;


                . availability of remittances from abroad;


                . means of support during  the  time  spent  in  the  United
                  Kingdom;


                . why his ability to fund the journey to the West no  longer
                  enables  an  appellant  to  secure  financial  support  on
                  return.


         (x)      Put another way, it will be for the person  facing  return
         to explain why  he  would  not  be  able  to  access  the  economic
         opportunities  that  have  been  produced  by  the  economic  boom,
         especially as there is evidence to the effect  that  returnees  are
         taking jobs at the expense of those who have never been away.


         (xi)     It will, therefore, only be those with no clan  or  family
         support who will not be in receipt of remittances from  abroad  and
         who have no real prospect of securing access  to  a  livelihood  on
         return who will  face  the  prospect  of  living  in  circumstances
         falling below that which is acceptable in  humanitarian  protection
         terms.


         (xii)    The evidence indicates clearly that it is not simply those
         who originate from Mogadishu that may now generally return to  live
         in the city without being subjected to an  Article  15(c)  risk  or
         facing a real risk of destitution. On the other hand, relocation in
         Mogadishu for a person of a minority clan  with no former links  to
         the city, no access to funds and no other form of clan,  family  or
         social support is unlikely to be realistic as, in  the  absence  of
         means to establish a  home  and  some  form  of  ongoing  financial
         support there will be a real risk of having no alternative  but  to
         live in makeshift accommodation within an IDP camp where there is a
         real possibility of having to live in  conditions  that  will  fall
         below acceptable humanitarian standards.


 4. The grounds, amplified in Mr Winter's submissions, specify four alleged
    errors.

 5. The first is that the appellant's evidence was that he  had  no  family
    left in Somalia was not disputed by the respondent in her decision, and
    the judge failed to make a finding on the material  matter  of  whether
    the appellant  had  "family  or  clan  associations  to  call  upon  in
    Mogadishu".

 6. Mr Matthews pointed out that the judge said at  �19  that  parties  had
    agreed the case "truly turned on credibility" and concluded at �26, "On
    all aspects of his claim I find his evidence incredible".  No error was
    suggested in those passages.  There was  at  �33  a  finding  that  the
    appellant suppressed evidence as "his only way of making any headway on
    a submission of not being able to return to Somalia"; see also �13.

 7. I find no error in the absence of a specific finding  about  family  in
    Somalia.   The  matter  was  covered  by  the  appellant's  failure  to
    establish his contentions.

 8. The second alleged error is the absence of a finding on the appellant's
    prospects of employment  on  return.   The  refusal  letter  refers  to
    employment in Burger King.  Mr Winter said that was for a brief period,
    and pointed out that in his statement the appellant said he  has  never
    been in long term employment.  Mr Matthews referred to �25,  where  the
    judge refers to the burden being on the appellant and to the generality
    of evidence and guidance that even  members  of  the  Reer  Hamar  (the
    appellant's clan) can start life again in Mogadishu and do not  face  a
    life so abject as to require international protection.

 9. I agree that the judge found that it was possible for the appellant  to
    secure a livelihood in Mogadishu.

10. The third alleged error is misunderstanding the evidence  in  that  (i)
    the judge failed to note the appellant's evidence that his  uncle  died
    in 2015, which vitiates his finding that the  appellant  could  receive
    remittances from abroad; and (ii) the judge was wrong to think that any
    family  members  other  than  his  deceased  uncle  had  supported  the
    appellant, or would continue to do so.

11. The judge recorded at �12 the appellant's oral evidence that his  uncle
    had died.  In saying at �33, "He lived with his uncle and  half  sister
    and that would be so should he leave detention", there may have been  a
    slip, but not one of any materiality. There plainly was  a  network  of
    family members in the UK.  Although the appellant failed  to  make  the
    position clear (when it was for him to do so), Mr Matthews showed  that
    it could be gleaned from his statements that he has his step-mother,  3
    sisters,  2  brothers  (or  half-sisters  and  half-brothers)  and   an
    indeterminate number of cousins in the UK.  The judge found at �33 that
    the appellant has wider family who "have supported  him  through  thick
    and thin" and would continue to do so.   There  is  no  error  in  this
    respect.

12. The fourth alleged error is failure to take account of the  appellant's
    lengthy  absence  from  Mogadishu,   and   absence   of   findings   on
    circumstances in Mogadishu before departure and on access to  financial
    resources.

13. The length of the appellant's  absence  and  his  circumstances  before
    departure, when he was a child, were matters obvious to the judge.   It
    would be idle to think that they played no part in the decision.   They
    did not need to be set out any more explicitly  than  they  were.   The
    question of access to financial resources, either by finding employment
    or through remittances, is covered above  by  reference  to  the  other
    grounds.

14. The underlying misconception in the grounds is that  any  void  in  the
    evidence should have led to findings in the  appellant's  favour.   The
    country guidance establishes how a case may be made, and directs judges
    on matters to consider.  It does not have  the  effect  that  where  an
    appellant fails to establish the truth of his claimed circumstances, it
    is then for the tribunal to divine what they really are, and that being
    impossible, to take the appellant's case as made.

15. Separately and together, the grounds fail to show that the  judge  fell
    into any error of failing to apply country guidance.

16. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

17. The FtT made an anonymity direction.  That may not have been necessary,
    but as the matter was not addressed  in  the  UT,  anonymity  has  been
    preserved herein.
