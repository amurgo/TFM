                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant before the Upper Tribunal is the Secretary of  State  for
    the Home Department.  I shall  refer  herein  to  Mr  Dhoorah  as  'the
    claimant'.

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Mauritius born 23 May  1960.   He  entered
    the United Kingdom on 16 July 1994 as a visitor. Leave  to  remain  was
    subsequently conferred on him until 31 January 1996, as a student.   He
    has remained unlawfully in the United Kingdom thereafter.

 3. On 23 August 2013 the claimant applied for leave to remain on Article 8
    ECHR grounds.  This application was refused by the Secretary  of  State
    in a decision dated 2 September 2013.  On the same date a decision  was
    made to remove the claimant from  the  United  Kingdom.   The  claimant
    appealed this decision to the First-tier Tribunal and this  appeal  was
    allowed by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Abebrese  "under  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights" in a determination promulgated  on  6  June
    2014.

 4. Judge J M Holmes granted the Secretary of State permission to appeal to
    the Upper Tribunal by way of a decision dated 4 July 2014:

         "2.  It is arguable, as identified in the grounds, that  the  judge
             adopted a 'near-miss' approach to the appellant's  failure  to
             meet the requirements for a grant of leave  on  the  basis  of
             long residency.  The appellant did not meet  the  requirements
             of the Immigration Rules for such a grant, he had enjoyed only
             one year's lawful residence in the UK and if he lived with his
             sister,  a  Mauritian  citizen  who  regularly  travelled   to
             Mauritius to visit family he arguably could not show a loss of
             his ties to that country.  Arguably the judge failed  to  give
             adequate weight to the respondent's  identification  of  where
             the boundaries might lie for a  grant  of  leave,  and  either
             there were no personal circumstances that meant  the  decision
             to refuse leave was disproportionate, or the judge  failed  to
             give adequate reasons for his decision that there were  having
             adopted a flawed approach to the  factual  background  to  the
             Article 8 appeal."

 5. Thus the appeal came before me.

Error of Law

 6. Turning first to the First-tier Tribunal's determination,  it  appears,
    although it is not entirely clear, that the  judge  accepted  that  the
    claimant had lived with his sister in  the  United  Kingdom  since  his
    arrival and that his sister currently provides him with ï¿½50  per  week.
    The claimant also has other siblings in this country but  he  does  not
    have much contact with them.  The claimant's sister visits Mauritius on
    a regular basis.  In relation to the  application  of  the  Immigration
    Rules the First-tier Tribunal Judge concluded:

         "12. The Tribunal finds on  the  evidence  and  the  law  that  the
             appellant has not satisfied the provisions  within  the  Rules
             regarding paragraph 276ADE as he falls  short  of  the  twenty
             years' continuous residence and he has does  have  social  and
             cultural ties still in Mauritius albeit limited as he has  not
             on the evidence visited that country since his arrival in this
             country in 1994."

 7. The judge then immediately  turns  to  a  consideration  of  Article  8
    outwith the Rules setting out the now  well-known  passages  from  Lord
    Bingham's judgment in Razgar.  In paragraph 13 of his determination the
    judge concludes that the interference  that  would  be  caused  to  the
    claimant's private and family life in the United Kingdom by his removal
    would have consequences of sufficient gravity to engage Article 8.  The
    judge further concludes, in paragraph 14  of  the  determination,  that
    interference  with  the  claimant's  Article  8  rights  would  be   in
    accordance with the law.  Turning to the issue of proportionality,  the
    judge said as follows:

         "15. The Tribunal also finds on the  evidence  that  the  appellant
             that the decision of the respondents is one that it is in  the
             interest of a democratic society as the appellant has been  in
             this country and appears on his own evidence to  have  made  a
             poor contribution to society.  He  has  not  worked  for  long
             periods and is financially supported by his sister, Ms  Thomas
             and her family.  It is in the public  interest  that  in  such
             instances where the appellant  has  a  precarious  immigration
             background that the  respondents  seriously  consider  removal
             options.  The appellant on the other hand  has  established  a
             private life in this country where he does have  strong  roots
             formed over a long period of time  and  this  should  also  be
             recognised.

         16.  The Tribunal finds on the evidence that  the  removal  of  the
             appellant on balance based on his length of residence in  this
             country and private and  family  life  would  make  a  removal
             disproportionate.   The  important  factors   here   are   the
             following.  The appellant at the  time  of  the  decision  had
             resided in this country for a period of nineteen years and ten
             months, he has not returned to Mauritius since his arrival  in
             1994.  He has spent the majority of his life in his country of
             birth but one should also not underestimate the period of time
             he has been in this country and the foundations which  he  has
             formed here.  The appellant's  sister  Ms  Thomas  has  closer
             contact with the members of the family in Mauritius even I  am
             of the view that the appellant has not completely cut  himself
             off from them and he would still  have  maintained  a  limited
             amount of cultural  and  social  ties  in  that  country.   On
             balance the Tribunal finds on the evidence that  it  would  be
             disproportionate to remove the  appellant  from  this  country
             after such a lengthy period in the United Kingdom."

 8. Before me Mr Butt submitted that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  given
    clear,  cogent  and  compelling  reasons  as  to  why   it   would   be
    disproportionate to remove this particular  claimant  from  the  United
    Kingdom.  Mr Walker  submitted  that  the  contrary  was  true  of  the
    determination i.e. that the reasons given by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    were wholly inadequate and it was, in reality, being said that  because
    the claimant nearly met the Rules he ought not to be removed. There are
    not, he argued, any features of the claimant's case which were  capable
    of  leading   to   the   conclusion   that   his   removal   would   be
    disproportionate.

 9. In my conclusion the First-tier Tribunal's determination is vitiated by
    a number of legal errors that lead me to set it aside.

10. The First-tier Tribunal properly found that the claimant could not meet
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  The claimant has not sought
    to lodge an appeal to the Upper Tribunal  against  such  decision.  The
    Tribunal thereafter went on to consider whether the claimant's  removal
    would breach his Article 8 ECHR rights  outwith  the  confines  of  the
    Rules.  In Nagre v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720  Sales  J  set  out  a  helpful
    approach to such a consideration (approved by the Court of Appeal in MF
    (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192):

         "29. ...The new Rules do provide better explicit  coverage  of  the
             factors identified in case law  as  relevant  to  analysis  of
             claims under Article 8 than was formerly the position,  so  in
             many cases the main points for consideration  in  relation  to
             Article 8 will be addressed by  decision-makers  applying  the
             new Rules.  It is only if, after doing that, there remains  an
             arguable case that there may  be  good  grounds  for  granting
             leave to remain outside the Rules by reference  to  Article  8
             that it will be necessary for Article 8 purposes to go  on  to
             consider  whether  there  are  compelling  circumstances   not
             sufficiently recognised under the new  Rules  to  require  the
             grant of such leave...

         30.  ...If, after the process of applying the new Rules and finding
             that the claim for leave  to  remain  under  them  fails,  the
             relevant official or Tribunal Judge considers it is clear that
             the consideration under the  Rules  has  fully  addressed  any
             family or private life issues  arising  under  Article  8,  it
             would be sufficient simply to say that; they would not have to
             go on, in addition, to consider the case separately  from  the
             Rules..."

11. It is important to recognise  that  proportionality  in  an  Article  8
    assessment must, in the new regime after 9 July 2012, be considered  in
    the context of the particularised public interest as  set  out  in  the
    Immigration Rules. There is a compelling public  interest  in  refusing
    permission to enter or leave  to  those  persons  who  have  failed  to
    establish a right to remain under the Rules.

12. In my conclusion the First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to  properly  direct
    itself to the relevant public interest.   The  only  place  within  the
    determination where the public interest is purportedly identified is in
    paragraph 15, where the judge says:

         "It is in the public interest that  in  such  instances  where  the
         appellant  has  a  precarious  immigration  background   that   the
         respondents seriously consider removal options."

    This though is not a proper reflection of the public interest  in  play
    in this case, in particular it cannot be said  to  fairly  reflect  the
    weight to be attached to the public interest.  This error of itself  is
    sufficiently serious to require me to set aside the  determination.  It
    is clearly an error which, in my conclusion, undermines the entirety of
    the First-tier Tribunal's assessment of the  issue  of  proportionality
    because absent a proper consideration of the weight to be  attached  to
    the public interest the First-tier Tribunal  cannot  be  said  to  have
    properly determined where the  balance  lies  in  this  case.  What  is
    apparent is that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  undertook  a  freewheeling
    analysis of Article 8 unencumbered  by  any  consideration  as  to  the
    weight to be attached to the public interest as particularised  in  the
    Immigration Rules.

13. This conclusion is supported by  the  terms  of  paragraph  16  of  the
    determination,  where  the  Tribunal  identifies  the  length  of   the
    claimant's residence in the United Kingdom, i.e. nineteen years and ten
    months, as being the predominant feature leading to its conclusion that
    the   claimant's   removal   from   the   United   Kingdom   would   be
    disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.  The  public  interest,
    as  particularised  in  paragraph  276ADE  of  the  Immigration  Rules,
    identifies 20 years' residence prior to  the  date  of  application  as
    being the relevant threshold, not 19 years 10 months.

14. For these reasons I set  aside  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.





Re-making of decision

15. I directed at the hearing that I would re-make the decision on  Article
    8 for myself.  Neither party sought to persuade me otherwise,  nor  did
    either party wish to make any further submissions.

16. It is for the claimant to demonstrate, on the balance of probabilities,
    both the relevant factual matrix and that Article 8 is engaged.  It  is
    for the Respondent to justify any interference with an engaged right.

17. The First-tier Tribunal concluded that the claimant has both a  private
    and family life in the United Kingdom.  These findings  have  not  been
    the subject of challenge and, consequently, I do not depart from  them.
    The extent of the claimant's private life is not  readily  identifiable
    from the papers before me, but it is clear is that he  arrived  in  the
    United Kingdom in 1994 and has lived  here  ever  since.   His  witness
    statement identifies that during his time here he has  worked  "on  and
    off" as a car washer,  although  not  since  December  2012.   It  also
    identifies that he has relatives and has friends here, is now  in  good
    health despite previously having had a liver problem, and that  he  has
    had casual relationships but nothing more serious. I  have  taken  full
    account of the evidence given in this regard.

18. As to the claimant's family life, the First-tier Tribunal accepted that
    the claimant has lived  with  his  British  citizen  sister  since  his
    arrival, during which time she has provided financial support  to  him.
    The papers  disclose  little  else  relating  to  the  nature  of  this
    relationship.

19. The First-tier Tribunal found that the consequences of  the  claimant's
    removal would be sufficiently serious so as to engage article 8. Again,
    this is a conclusion which has not been the subject  of  challenge  and
    one that I do not go behind.

20. Turning to the core issue in this appeal, that of  proportionality.  It
    is the Respondent's case that the claimant's removal can  be  justified
    in pursuance of the  economic  well-being  of  the  country  and,  more
    particularly, the maintenance of immigration control.

21. The claimant does not meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules,
    for the reasons set out by the First-tier Tribunal.  Before me Mr  Butt
    argued that the claimant has no connections to Mauritius and  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal's conclusions to the contrary are flawed. I see  no
    reason to exercise my discretion to re-open this issue.  This  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal, made in relation to the Immigration  Rules,
    is one that the claimant could have sought to appeal, but he chose  not
    to.

22. In any event, had I been required to re-determine this issue for myself
    I would have come to exactly the  same  conclusion  as  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. Although the claimant had, as of the date of his  application
    for leave, lived outside  of  Mauritius  for  approximately  19  years,
    having taken into account the guidance given on this issue in  Ogundimu
    [2013] UKUT 60, I do not accept that it has been demonstrated that  the
    claimant has 'no ties' to Mauritius. He has family  there,  his  sister
    with whom he lives regularly visits the country, and the claimant lived
    the first 34 years of his life there.

23. Moving on, there is a compelling public interest in refusing permission
    to remain to those persons, such as the claimant, who  have  failed  to
    establish a right to remain under the Immigration Rules.  Although  the
    claimant has been in the United Kingdom, now,  for  over  20  years,  a
    matter I have taken full account of, for the majority of this time  his
    stay has been unlawful.

24. The evidence as to the extent of claimant's private  and  family  life,
    developed during his lengthy unlawful stay here, is limited, as I  have
    already set out above. The claimant's relationship to his sister is  no
    doubt important to him and I have taken full account of this.  He  also
    has other relatives in the United Kingdom with  whom  he  has  contact,
    such relationships forming a part of his private life here, as does his
    relationships with his friends.  There is no evidence before me  as  to
    what impact the claimant's removal would have on  his  UK-based  family
    members and friends, although one would expect his sister to  be  upset
    by such an event.  There is also no evidence before me that would  lead
    me to conclude that the claimant could  not  re-integrate  back  in  to
    Mauritian society upon his return  there.  Although  the  claimant  has
    limited ties to Mauritius, he does have relatives living there and  his
    sister has also retained connections.

25. Looking at the evidence before me as a whole, I find that there are  no
    compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised  under  the  Rules
    that would lead me to conclude that it would not  be  proportionate  to
    remove this claimant to his homeland. The public interest  in  removing
    persons  who  remain  in  the  UK  unlawfully  and  do  not  meet   the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules is ample  justification,  on  the
    facts of this particular case, for the claimant's removal to Mauritius.
     In my conclusion there is nothing  in  the  facts  of  this  case,  as
    presented, which come anywhere close to leading me to conclude that the
    claimant's removal would be a disproportionate  interference  with  his
    private and family life in the United Kingdom.  For this reason  I  re-
    make the decision by dismissing the appeal brought on  Article  8  ECHR
    grounds.

Decision

For the reasons given above:

      i) The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside;
     ii) Having re-made the decision for myself, I  dismiss  the  claimant's
         appeal on all grounds.
