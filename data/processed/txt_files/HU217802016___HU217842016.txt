For the Appellant:     Mr J Gulshan (Legal Representative, Maalik & Co)
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The case turns on the position of the First Appellant as the Second
    Appellant is dependent on her. There is a complex procedural history in
    this matter which was considered by First-tier Tribunal Judge Keane and
    which appears to have been dealt with erroneously which did not
    undermine the findings made in the decision itself but affects the
    final outcome as discussed below.

 2. The First Appellant had applied for leave to remain as a Tier 2
    migrant. There had been an application made before the expiry of
    previous leave in February 2014 which was later varied to become the
    Tier 2 application. That was rejected by the Secretary of State on the
    basis that the First Appellant had not provided biometric information
    as had been required. judicial review proceedings followed in which it
    was conceded that the First Appellant had provided the required
    biometric information and accordingly the application made was valid.

 3. Although the Judge decided that the application giving rise to the
    appeal had been made on the 1st of December 2015 it was common ground
    at the hearing before the me that the Judge was actually dealing with a
    continuation of the February 2014 application. It is not clear why the
    Judge took that issue as it appears to have been common ground between
    the parties following the Judicial Review proceedings and the
    concession made by the Secretary of State once the matter had been
    reconsidered. Had the Judge been considering only a December 2015 the
    Appellants would have had a right of administrative review and not a
    substantive appeal and the case could not have been listed as it was.

 4. The practical effect of the appeal being based on an application made
    in February 2014 is that the previous version of section 84 of the 2002
    Act applies in terms of the grounds of appeal available to an
    Appellant. By section 84(1)(a) of the 2002 Act it was a ground of
    appeal "that the decision is not in accordance with the Immigration
    Rules". That rule was abolished in October 2014 but transitional
    provisions apply to these proceedings and so that remains a ground of
    appeal available to the First Appellant.

 5. The First Appellant's application had been refused for the reasons
    given in the Refusal Letter of the 5th of September 2016. In that
    letter the Appellant was awarded the required points for the Tier 2
    application that she had made. However, the application was refused
    under paragraph 322(2) of the Immigration Rules on the basis that the
    First Appellant had used deception in a previous application.

 6. It is not necessary to examine the nature of the allegation of
    deception made because Judge Keane rejected the Home Office's case on
    that issue and found that refusal under paragraph 322(2) was not
    justified on the evidence. That finding has not been challenged by the
    Secretary of State. The position now is that the Secretary of State as
    stated in the Refusal Letter accepts that the Appellant meets the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and there is no basis for a
    discretionary refusal of the Appellant's case.

 7. On the basis of paragraph 6 it is clear that the Refusal Letter stands
    to the extent that the First Appellant meets the requirements of the
    Immigration Rules. There being no justification for refusing the First
    Appellant's appeal and given the grounds of appeal open to the
    Appellant under the applicable provisions of section 84(1)(a) as it
    applies to these proceedings the First Appellant's appeal has to be
    allowed and the Second Appellant's appeal has to be allowed in line
    with that of his wife.



CONCLUSIONS

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making
of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal to the extent that it
was found that the Appellants removal would be proportionate. I remake the
decision and allow the Appellants' appeals on the basis that they meet the
provisions of the Immigration Rules and that that was a ground of appeal
available to them on the law that applied to these appeals.



Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and I make no
order.

In allowing this appeal I make a fee award in the sum of ï¿½280
