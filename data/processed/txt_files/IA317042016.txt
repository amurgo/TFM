For the Respondent:    Mr Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of China born on 20th September  1985.   She
    appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated  30th  July  2014
    refusing to vary her leave to remain in the United Kingdom and deciding
    to remove her from the United Kingdom.  The Respondent states that  the
    Appellant has failed to show that she meets the requirements of a  Tier
    1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  under  the  points-based  system   of   the
    Immigration Rules.  The appeal was heard by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Lal on 12th May 2015.  He  found  that  the  decision  of  the
    Respondent was not in accordance with the relevant Immigration Laws and
    Rules and remitted  it  back  to  the  Respondent.   The  decision  was
    promulgated on 18th May 2015.

 2. An application for permission to appeal was lodged and the  grounds  of
    application refer to paragraph 8 of the decision. They state that there
    is no indication of what the matters were which, in the opinion of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge, meant he could not  deal  with  the  appeal.
    The grounds state that no adequate reasoning has been  provided  as  to
    why the matter should be remitted  back  to  the  Secretary  of  State.
    Permission was granted by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Grant-
    Hutchison on 14th July 2015.

 3. A Rule 24 response was lodged which states that  the  First-tier  Judge
    did not err when he decided that the matter should be remitted back  to
    the Respondent.

 4. Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Hill found there to be an error of  law  in
    the First-tier Tribunal judge's decision and set it aside. He  remitted
    the matter back to the First-tier Tribunal for a de novo hearing.

 5. The appeal was then heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Grant  on
    15th December 2015.  She dismissed the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules and her decision was promulgated on 11th January 2016.

 6. An application for permission to appeal was lodged and  permission  was
    granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Holmes on 17th  June  2016.
    The  permission  states  that  Judge  Grant  confused  the   evidential
    requirements for an appellant's own funds with those  for  third  party
    funding.  It goes on to state that the Respondent's approach of  making
    investigations into the application and then interviewing the Appellant
    without giving her the opportunity to  comment  on  issues  which  were
    later said to give rise  for  concern  that  her  application  was  not
    genuine, was procedurally unfair - EK Ivory Coast [2014] EWCA Civ 1517.
     The permission states that the judge  also  allowed  the  decision  of
    Judge Lal to influence her.

 7. There is a Rule 24 response dated 26 June 2016 which  states  that  the
    findings of fact made by Judge Grant were open to her. At paragraph  12
    of the decision the judge explains why words like "questionable" in the
    refusal letter do not make the decision unfair. The judge  acknowledges
    numerous credibility issues, in particular the Appellant's  attempt  to
    conceal the fact that she was working  at  Wing  Yip  supermarket.  The
    response states that the Appellant has not  discharged  the  burden  of
    proof. It refers to various concerns such as the late arrival of  funds
    and the unsatisfactory market research, which are referred  to  by  the
    judge and states that the judge was entitled to make  adverse  findings
    about these matters.

The Hearing

 8. Counsel for the Appellant made his  submissions,  submitting  that  the
    decision is procedurally unfair.  He referred to the said  case  of  EK
    Ivory Coast paragraphs 41 and 42.  He submitted that normally under the
    points-based system fairness does not arise but it does in  this  case.
    He referred me to the case of Naved [2012] UKUT 14 (IAC) at  paragraphs
    15 to 19.  He submitted that the Appellant was  not  asked  to  produce
    pieces of evidence and that these are referred to  in  the  Grounds  of
    Appeal. The Respondent made enquiries herself and did  not  notify  the
    Appellant of the responses she got. I was referred to paragraph  16  of
    the grounds.  Counsel submitted that the  First-tier  Judge  could  not
    consider what was not before her at the hearing.  He submitted that the
    Respondent did not give the Appellant the opportunity to comment on the
    investigations referred to in paragraph 16 of the grounds.

 9. Counsel referred to the serious allegation of  deception  made  against
    the  Appellant.   He  submitted  that  the  burden  of  proof  was  not
    discharged in relation to this.  In the  judge's  decision  she  states
    that she does not find the Appellant's arguments  to  be  "attractive".
    The judge found that the decision was not unfair at paragraph 12.   The
    representative submitted that the judge has missed the key point  here.
    Questions could have been asked at the Appellant's interview  but  were
    not, which meant that the Appellant had no chance to  deal  with  these
    issues at the hearing.

10. With regard to third party funding the  representative  submitted  that
    the judge erred  relating  to  this  as  the  money  being  put  up  in
    connection with the Appellant's business is the Appellant's  money,  it
    is not third party funding.  In these circumstances disclosure  of  the
    source of the funds is not necessary.

11. The grounds make it clear  that  specified  documents  required  to  be
    produced by the Appellant and counsel submitted that the fact that  the
    Appellant was not told of these  makes  the  decision  unfair.   I  was
    referred to paragraph 26 of the grounds which refers to paragraph 41-SD
    of the Rules.  He submitted that if the Appellant uses her  own  funds,
    which in this case she does, as long as  the  funds  are  in  her  bank
    account that is sufficient.   In  this  case  the  funds  were  in  the
    Appellant's bank account.

12. The Presenting Officer made his submissions relying on the Respondent's
    Rule 24 response.

13. With regard to the decision being unfair procedurally, I  was  referred
    to paragraph 11 of Judge Grant's decision and  he  submitted  that  the
    judge clearly grapples with the question of  whether  the  refusal  was
    essentially unfair.  The judge  states  that  she  does  not  find  the
    Appellant's arguments to be attractive and at paragraph  12  the  judge
    sets out her reasons for this finding.  In  this  paragraph  the  judge
    refers  to  the  Appellant  being  an  employee  of  Wing  Yip  Chinese
    supermarket.  This was raised at the interview and at paragraph 12  the
    judge states  that  the  Appellant's  evidence  lacks  credibility,  in
    particular relating to this employment.

14. The Presenting Officer referred to paragraph 245DD of  the  Immigration
    Rules, particularly sub-Sections (h), (i) and (k).  He  submitted  that
    even if there is merit in  the  Appellant's  argument,  the  First-tier
    Judge clearly does not find that the terms of these sub-Sections can be
    satisfied.  Credibility is the issue here. Even  if  I  find  that  the
    Appellant did not have the opportunity to address some issues the  fact
    is that she was an employee of Wing Yip.   This  became  clear  at  the
    interview so the issue of whether the Appellant was  not  warned  about
    some other issues is not material.

15. With regard to the serious allegations  of  deception  referred  to  by
    Counsel the Presenting Officer submitted that had this  been  the  case
    the matter would have been refused under Section 9 and it was not.   It
    was refused under paragraph 245DD.

16. With regard to the issue of third party funds  the  Presenting  Officer
    submitted that the judge may have made an error about this,  but  there
    are other findings made  by  the  judge  relating  to  the  funds.   At
    paragraph 13 of the decision the judge refers to the funds not arriving
    until  three  months  after  the  Appellant  allegedly  commenced   her
    business.  In the refusal letter the Respondent refers to the Appellant
    being unable to identify the source of the funds  for  the  Respondent.
    He submitted that this is different  from  third  party  funding.   The
    judge also refers at paragraph 14, to the fact that  no  proper  market
    research was undertaken by the Appellant.  The judge finds that due  to
    a lack of credibility the Appellant has set up her company in order  to
    circumvent the Immigration Rules so she can continue  to  work  in  the
    United Kingdom as an employee of Wing Yip supermarket.  The judge finds
    that based on the evidence before her and the  amount  of  money  being
    paid to the Appellant, the Appellant is not doing occasional  work  for
    Wing Yip supermarket and that this will have a grave impact on her self-
    employment and her ability to run her own company.

17. The Presenting Officer submitted that there may be some  merit  in  the
    grounds but the judge looked at the overall picture  and  the  specific
    matters raised by the judge cannot be ignored.   She  was  entitled  to
    make the findings that she did.

18. I was asked to uphold the First-tier Tribunal's decision.

19. Counsel submitted that the judge has missed the  fairness  point.   The
    Appellant did not have a chance to answer the issues which were raised.
     I was referred to the refusal letter at page 6  which  refers  to  her
    working for Wing Yip earning �200 to �300 per week. He  submitted  that
    this raises the question of how she has managed to create the  time  to
    work there as well as set up and create her own business  and  work  in
    it.  The refusal letter states that this casts doubt on the credibility
    of her experience and the viability of her  maintaining  her  marketing
    consultancy business.  Counsel submitted  that  the  judge  could  have
    asked about this.  She might well have been able to answer and so there
    is unfairness.  He also submitted that the source of the funds does not
    require to be shown.  The money came from one of  the  appellant's  own
    bank accounts.  She could have answered this if it had been put to her.

20. Counsel submitted that the errors are material and I was asked  to  set
    aside the First-tier Judge's decision.

21. I have considered carefully all the matters before me. With  regard  to
    the issue of third party funding and paragraph  15  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge's decision the judge made an error when she referred  to
    the funding as "third party funding".  The Respondent stated  that  the
    Appellant  was  unable  to  identify  the  source  of  funds  for   the
    Respondent. This is a different matter from third  party  funding.  The
    Appellant's claim is that she is using her  own  money.   I  find  that
    although the judge has made an error it is not a material error as  the
    judge also found it to be significant that the  funds  did  not  arrive
    until three months after the business started. She also  makes  mention
    of other credibility issues.

22. The grounds of application refer to the Appellant not being  given  the
    chance to answer questions about certain  issues  referred  to  by  the
    Respondent but the judge has dismissed the appeal  due  to  a  lack  of
    credibility not because the Appellant was unable  to  deal  with  these
    issues.  The main credibility issue is the appellant trying to  conceal
    the fact that she is working as an employee of Wing Yip.  The Appellant
    only owned  up  to  working  for  this  supermarket  when  specifically
    questioned about credits in her bank account.  There is also  the  fact
    that no  proper  market  research  was  carried  out.   The  judge  has
    explained her credibility findings in her decision.

23. The grounds of application refer to procedural unfairness.  It is  true
    that the Respondent conducted investigations of her own but even if the
    Appellant had had the opportunity to comment on  these  investigations,
    the credibility issues would still have  been  there.   The  judge  has
    explained the reasons which led to her dismissing the appeal.

24. I have considered the said cases of Naved and EK  Ivory  Coast.   In  a
    points-based system case, procedural unfairness is  unusual.   In  this
    case I find there to be no procedural unfairness.  The application  was
    refused due to a lack of credibility. Any errors in  the  decision  are
    not material errors.

25. The judge's findings were open to her.  The burden of proof relating to
    credibility is on the Appellant. She has not discharged it.

Notice of Decision

26. There is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    decision.  The First-tier Tribunal's decision must stand.

27. The Appellant's appeal is dismissed as per the decision promulgated  on
    11th January 2016 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Grant.

28. Anonymity has not been directed in this case.
