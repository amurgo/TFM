Representation:

For the Appellants: Mr D. Mold, Counsel
For the Respondent: Mr T. Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The first appellant is a citizen of Malaysia, born on 5  July  1983.
       The second appellant is her husband and is a citizen of  China,  his
       date of birth being 16 December 1977. The third appellant  is  their
       daughter and was born on 28 July 2009.  For  the  sake  of  clarity,
       where in this determination we  refer  to  "the  appellant"  we  are
       referring to the first appellant.

    2. During the currency of their existing leave the appellants  applied,
       on 7 December 2012, for further leave  to  remain.  The  appellant's
       application was made as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrant,  with  the
       other appellants as her dependants.

    3. The appellant's application was refused and those of her husband and
       daughter were refused in line with the  decision  in  her  case.  No
       substantive considerations arise in respect of the second and  third
       appellants whose position is entirely dependent on that of the first
       appellant.

    4. The appellant's application was refused on the basis that the letter
       from the Bank of China, which  evidences  the  availability  of  the
       necessary funds, failed to  confirm  that  she  has  access  to  the
       �200,000 necessary for investment in the business. Consequently, she
       was not awarded the required points under Appendix A for  access  to
       funds. Correspondingly, she was awarded no points for funds held  in
       a  regulated  financial  institution,  and  in  respect   of   funds
       disposable in the UK.

    5. A separate ground of refusal was in relation to Maintenance (Funds),
       it being said that the bank statements the  appellant  had  produced
       did not show that she had the  requisite  �2,100  for  the  required
       consecutive 90 day period ending no more than  31  days  before  the
       date of application.

    6. First-tier judge Chohan dismissed the substantive  appeals,  finding
       that she had failed to submit relevant documentary  evidence  as  at
       the date of application. He declined  to  take  into  account  post-
       decision evidence, having regard to section 85A of the  Nationality,
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. He allowed the appeals in  relation
       to the unlawful decision taken under section 47 of the  Immigration,
       Asylum and Nationality Act  2006  and  nothing  now  turns  on  that
       decision.

    7. The appellant contends that the First-tier judge  erred  in  law  by
       failing to take into account evidence which showed that she had been
       requested by the Secretary of State to re-submit evidence, that  the
       decision was taken before that evidence was received  and  that  the
       evidence  showed  that  she  met  the  requirements  of  the  Rules.
       Secondly, it is said that the First-tier judge had  failed  to  deal
       with the issue of maintenance, about which the Secretary of  State's
       decision was flawed. Thirdly, it is contended  that  the  judge  had
       failed to consider Article 8 of the ECHR.

   Our assessment

    8. So far as maintenance under the Immigration Rules is  concerned,  it
       is accepted on behalf of the appellant that she was required to show
       funds of �2,100 for a consecutive period of 90 days  in  an  account
       that is dated  no  earlier  than  31  days  prior  to  the  date  of
       application. The respondent's decision states that the funds in  her
       account dipped below that minimum level  on  two  occasions  in  the
       relevant period. That conclusion was reached with reference  to  the
       appellant's HSBC account. However, it is clear  that  the  appellant
       provided bank statements from two HSBC accounts. She referred to two
       bank statements  on  the  application  form  and  there  are  indeed
       statements from accounts with HSBC with different account numbers in
       the respondent's bundle.

    9. It is not necessary for us to set out the detail of the dates of the
       accounts or the funds in them because it was conceded by Mr  Wilding
       that there were sufficient  funds  evidenced  in  one  of  the  HSBC
       accounts such as to comply with the requirements of Appendix  C.  It
       was also conceded that the First-tier judge erred in law in  failing
       to determine the issue of maintenance.

   10. It is clear that the respondent failed to have regard to the  second
       bank statement from HSBC which did evidence the  required  level  of
       funds. In turn the First-tier judge erred in law in not  determining
       that issue, and moreover, in not determining it in the  appellant's'
       favour.

   11. It is as well to state at this point that it was  also  conceded  on
       behalf of the respondent that the First-tier judge erred in  law  in
       not considering the Article 8 ground of appeal. That is a concession
       rightly made, given that Article 8  is  raised  in  the  grounds  of
       appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.  Mr  Wilding  submitted  however,
       that that was not an error of law that requires the decision  to  be
       set aside, on the basis that apart from the length of time the first
       and second appellants had been in the UK, there was little  evidence
       as to their private lives here.

   12. Whether the admitted errors of law require the decision  to  be  set
       aside depends  on  the  outcome  of  our  assessment  of  the  other
       arguments advanced on behalf of the  appellants,  to  which  we  now
       turn.

   13. Appendix A of HC 395 (as amended) ("the Immigration Rules") provides
       that an applicant for leave to remain as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
       Migrant must accrue the requisite number of points set out in  Table
       4 of that Appendix. That in turn requires  that  in  this  case  the
       appellant has access to not less than �200,000, that  the  money  is
       held in one or more regulated financial institutions  and  that  the
       money is disposable in the UK.

   14. Paragraph 41  of  Appendix  A  requires  the  appellant  to  provide
       specified documents as set out in paragraph 41-SD. In particular for
       the purposes of this appeal, paragraph 41-SD(a)(i)(6) requires  that
       the letter from the financial institution  holding  the  funds  must
       state the applicant's name. In passing we  note  that  this  is  not
       precisely what  is  said  in  the  decision  letter  about  why  the
       appellant does not meet the requirements of the Rules, the  decision
       letter stating that "you have provided evidence that the  funds  are
       held in the Bank of China, however this letter  from  the  financial
       institution must also confirm that you have access  to  the  funds."
       This phraseology to some  degree  chimes  with  paragraph  41(b)  of
       Appendix A which states that the specified documents in paragraph 4-
       SD are provided to show that the applicant has permission to use the
       money to invest in a business in the UK.

   15. Part of the narrative to this appeal is that on 28  March  2013  the
       respondent  wrote  to  the  appellant  stating  that   due   to   an
       administrative  error  the  Bank  of  China   letter   and   deposit
       certificate sent following her application were not  linked  to  her
       file. The letter requests that the appellant send a new copy of that
       evidence. No time scale is given by which those documents were to be
       submitted.

   16. On 19 April 2013 the appellant wrote to the respondent stating  that
       she had asked the bank  to  provide  another  copy  of  the  deposit
       certificate, stating that she had had an e-mail from the bank  which
       said that they would post it shortly. The appellant then stated that
       as soon as it is received she would send it to the  respondent.  The
       letter concludes by asking  that  she  be  contacted  if  any  other
       information is required.

   17. We observe that neither of those letters  was  in  the  respondent's
       bundle that was before the First-tier Tribunal. However,  they  were
       contained in the appellant's bundle that was before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal.

   18. The appellant's case, set out in the grounds before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal, is that she received the 'new' letter from  the  bank  and
       certificate of deposit on 29 April 2013 and was in  the  process  of
       posting it to the respondent but received the refusal decision on 30
       April 2013 (paras 10 and 11). Later, at para 3 she states  that  she
       received those documents on 1 and 2 May 2013, respectively.  In  any
       event it is said that the decision was taken before she had had  the
       chance to submit the documents to the respondent. This, it is  said,
       was unfair in common law terms and the decision in Naved (Student  -
       fairness - notice of points) [2012] UKUT 14(IAC) is relied on.

   19. That 'new' letter from the Bank of China, dated 23 April 2013 with a
       translation dated 29 April 2013, states that the deposit can be used
       by one Jimmy Eng  Seng  Tan  (presumably  the  appellant's  business
       partner) and Ms Chong Li May (the first appellant) for their Tier  1
       Entrepreneur application. However, the original bank letter that was
       sent to the respondent in support of the application  only  has  the
       name of the account holder on it, that is the  appellant's  husband,
       the second appellant.

   20. It  follows  therefore,  that  at  the  date  of  the  decision  the
       respondent only had a bank letter  that  did  not  comply  with  the
       requirements of the rules; it did not contain the appellant's name.

   21. Mr Wilding suggested, and we agree,  that  it  is  likely  that  the
       respondent in fact located the documents that the appellant had sent
       with the application, because the decision was made  with  reference
       to those documents which appear  in  the  respondent's  bundle,  and
       before the further documents were sent to the respondent.

   22. The contention that there was 'unfairness' in the respondent  taking
       the decision before the 'new' bank letter was sent is not  made  out
       in our view, at least not on the basis on which it  was  argued.  It
       was never represented to the appellant that a decision would not  be
       taken until evidence that complied with the  Immigration  Rules  was
       provided. It was  simply  a  question  of  the  appellant  providing
       further copies of what she had already provided. On the  basis  that
       the respondent located the documents that were mislaid, there was no
       reason for the decision not  to  be  made  on  the  basis  of  those
       documents, subject to what we say below.

   23. The appellant's letter to the First-tier Tribunal dated 9  May  2013
       in the appellant's bundle, states at para 3 that  she  explained  to
       the respondent that as the funds were being provided by her  husband
       who was in the UK he would have to ask his  parents  to  obtain  the
       bank letter and that this could take a while. In fact, as is evident
       from our summary of the letter the appellant wrote to the respondent
       on 19 April 2013, there was no indication of those  difficulties  in
       obtaining further copies of those  documents.  Again  therefore,  to
       suggest unfairness on the basis that  those  difficulties  were  not
       taken into account is not tenable.

   24. We proceed on the footing therefore, that on  the  face  of  it  the
       respondent was entitled to 'proceed' on the basis  of  the  evidence
       that was before her. That is not necessarily  the  same  as  stating
       that she was entitled to make the decision  on  the  application  on
       that basis of that evidence.

   25. This was an application in which a piece of information  in  one  of
       the documents was missing. The appellants rely on  the  decision  of
       the Upper Tribunal in Rodriguez  (Flexibility  Policy)  [2013]  UKUT
       00042 (IAC). However, that decision was overruled by  the  Court  of
       Appeal in Rodriguez [2014] EWCA Civ 2. Mr Mold  now  relies  on  the
       decision of the Court of Appeal, in essence in terms of what is said
       in that decision about the correct appreciation  of  the  evidential
       flexibility guidance. However, the decision does explain the  limits
       of the guidance (see para 90). The facts of that  appeal  were  very
       different from those in the appeals before us. Mrs Rodriguez did not
       demonstrate that she had the required level of  funds  and,  as  the
       Court of Appeal observed at para 93, there was  no  reason  for  the
       Secretary of State to believe that she had other funds such as would
       allow her to meet the relevant financial requirement.

   26. It was accepted before us on behalf of the respondent that there was
       in existence at the time of this appellant's application and at  the
       time of  the  decision  Evidential  Flexibility  guidance.  We  were
       provided with a copy of it. It is stated to be valid from  12  March
       2013. Mr Wilding referred us to page 5 of the guidance which  states
       that

             "This page tells you about requesting additional information if
             there is missing evidence,  or  evidence  that  is  not  in  an
             acceptable format.

             You  must  only  request  additional  information  in   certain
             circumstances  which  would  lead  to  the  approval   of   the
             application.

             Before requesting additional evidence you must have  sufficient
             reason to believe the information exists."

   27. Examples are given of the type of information, the lack of which may
       prompt a request for additional information, that paragraph  stating
       that the examples are not limited to those given.  Mr  Wilding  very
       fairly also referred us to another page of the guidance which  gives
       other examples which are more apposite to the facts of  the  appeals
       before us. Under the heading "Tier 1 Entrepreneur" one  of  the  two
       examples given is "missing information from the required letters  or
       documents".

   28. Mr Wilding suggested that there was no reason to  believe  that  the
       missing information in the bank letter was in existence, thus  there
       was no reason for the appellant to  be  contacted  pursuant  to  the
       Evidential  Flexibility  policy.  However,  it  is  clear  from  the
       decision letter that the Secretary  of  State  was  aware  that  the
       appellant was relying on the 'third party' funds of her husband  who
       had provided a statutory declaration as to the availability  of  the
       funds for the appellant's use as a Tier  1  entrepreneur.  The  bank
       deposit certificate was in his  name  but  the  Secretary  of  State
       acknowledged that he was willing for those funds to be used for  the
       appellant,  the  decision  letter  referring  to  the  "third  party
       declaration."

   29. It is of interest to note  that  evidential  flexibility  under  the
       Points Based System is now, and was at the time of this decision,  a
       matter reflected in the Immigration Rules. It is not  necessary  for
       us to set out the detail of paragraph 245AA (entitled "Documents not
       submitted with applications") which applied  at  the  date  of  this
       decision. Suffice to say, its terms arguably would not have  availed
       the appellants.

   30. Returning then to the Evidential Flexibility policy. It is true that
       it contains within it a discretion  on  the  part  of  the  decision
       maker, for example on page 2 it states that

              "...if there  are  minor  errors  or  omissions  on  a  valid
              application  but  there  is  enough  evidence  to  show   the
              application would otherwise be granted, you may  contact  the
              migrant,  sponsor  or  representative  as   appropriate   for
              clarification   or   to   request   missing   documents   and
              or/information"  (our emphasis).

   31. However if, as we understood Mr  Wilding  to  have  suggested,  that
       discretion meant that there was no requirement for the appellant  to
       be contacted, we disagree. If the discretion under the policy  could
       be exercised or not in a completely random or  arbitrary  way,  that
       would make the policy redundant for practical purposes. It is to  be
       expected that a policy such as this would be applied in the ordinary
       course of events unless there were reasons  not  to  apply  it.  The
       decision letter does not refer  to  any  (not  that  the  Evidential
       Flexibility policy was expressly referred to at all in  the  letter)
       and Mr Wilding did not suggest any reasons as to why purely in terms
       of its discretionary application, it should not have applied to this
       appellant.

   32. We recognise that, perhaps, there is a debate to be had  about  what
       amounts to a "minor error or omission". However, a specific  example
       given in the guidance to which we have referred in relation to  Tier
       1 Entrepreneur applications is missing information from the required
       letters or documents. In the context of this appeal we are  entirely
       satisfied that the fact that the appellant's name  was  not  on  the
       Bank  of  China  letter  comes  within  the  Evidential  Flexibility
       guidance.

   33. The decision letter does state that the decision was taken "in  line
       with the published guidance and Appendix A of the  Rules".  However,
       if  that  could  be  said  to  show  awareness  of  the   Evidential
       Flexibility policy, that awareness was not translated into action in
       conformity with that guidance in this case.

   34. We are satisfied that the decision maker acting  on  behalf  of  the
       Secretary of State should have contacted the appellant in accordance
       with the Evidential Flexibility policy in relation  to  the  missing
       information on the bank letter. It is no answer that  the  Secretary
       of State was of the view that the application failed in terms of the
       maintenance requirement. As we  now  know,  that  was  based  on  an
       incorrect appreciation of the evidence in the bank statements.

   35. We have further considered the requirements of Appendix A  in  terms
       of evidence required where funds are provided by a third  party,  as
       here, in particular what appears to be a requirement under 41-SD for
       a letter from a legal representative in relation to the third  party
       declaration. However, the Secretary of  State's  decision  does  not
       raise this as an issue and no submission was made on behalf  of  the
       respondent before us to the effect that that requirement would  have
       defeated the appellant's application in any event. In short, it  was
       not given as a basis for refusal of the application.

   36. The result in our view is that the Secretary of State's decision  is
       not in accordance with the law in that it failed to have regard  to,
       or  failed  to  apply,  the   Evidential   Flexibility   policy   in
       circumstances where that policy applied. The appeals  are  therefore
       to  be  allowed  on  that  limited  basis.  It  follows   that   the
       applications remain  outstanding  before  the  Secretary  of  State,
       awaiting a lawful decision.

   37. In these circumstances, the alternative Article 8 ground  of  appeal
       is academic.

   38. The decision to remove  the  appellants  under  section  47  of  the
       Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 was, as the  First-tier
       judge recognised, an unlawful decision. Thus, as Mr Wilding said,  a
       lawful removal decision remains to be made, the appeal against  that
       removal decision having been allowed by the First-tier Tribunal.







Decision

   39. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  an
       error on a point of law. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is
       set aside and the decision re-made  allowing  the  appeals  of  each
       appellant on the limited basis that those decisions in each case are
       not in accordance with the law.




Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek
                                                 22/01/14
