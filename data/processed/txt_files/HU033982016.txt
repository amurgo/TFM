                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, born on  19  April  1972.  He
      came to the United Kingdom on a visit Visa in 2008. He was arrested on
      27 June 2009 for possession of  cannabis  and  for  overstaying.  When
      advised he was liable to detention he claimed asylum. This was refused
      in July 2009. He then made an application for leave  to  remain  as  a
      spouse. This was refused in April 2010. He made a further application,
      this time as a partner. This  was  refused  in  April  2013.  He  made
      various submissions  in  November  2012  in  June  2013:  all  without
      success. He made a further application for leave to remain  which  was
      refused in October 2014.


   2. On 24 July 2015 he made another application for leave to remain.  This
      was on the basis of his marriage to a  British  citizen,  Ms  Mercedes
      Rivera. This was refused on 25 January 2016.  Under  Appendix  FM  the
      suitability grounds were not met because of his failure to disclose  a
      conviction on 4  July  2014.  He  did  however  meet  the  eligibility
      requirements and it was accepted he was in a  genuine  and  subsisting
      relationship. EX1 was considered but the  respondent  concluded  there
      was no evidence of insurmountable obstacles to family life  continuing
      in Pakistan. The couple had no children.

   3. Regard was had to paragraph 276 ADE and private life.  The  respondent
      saw no significant obstacles to the appellant integrating  again  into
      Pakistan. No exceptional circumstances were identified. The  appellant
      referred to mental health issues but the  respondent  concluded  there
      was adequate treatment available in Pakistan.


The First tier Tribunal

   4. His appeal was heard before First-tier Judge Chana on 21  April  2017.
      In a decision promulgated  on  26  May  2017  it  was  dismissed.  The
      appellant was represented then, as he is now, by Miss Childs.


   5. The decision records at  paragraph  10  that  the  judge  advised  the
      appellant's  representative  that  although  the  genuineness  of  the
      relationship had been accepted in the refusal  letter,  following  the
      evidence of the appellant and Ms Mercedes Rivera,  it  had  become  an
      issue. The judge questioned the credibility of the  appellant  and  Ms
      Mercedes Rivera and sets out details  of  their  evidence.  The  judge
      concluded by finding that the appellant  was  not  in  a  genuine  and
      subsisting relationship. In respect of  his  private  life  the  judge
      found he did not meet the terms of the immigration rules and there was
      no basis for granting leave outside the rules.



The Upper Tribunal


   6. The appellant was granted permission to appeal on  the  basis  it  was
      arguable that the judge erred in law in questioning  the  relationship
      between the appellant and his wife when the respondent had  not  taken
      the point. It was also contended the judge had not properly considered
      the evidence about the relationship. A further  ground  was  that  the
      judge failed to  make  findings  on  whether  the  appellant  met  the
      suitability requirements under the rules. It was  also  arguable  that
      the judge  engaged  in  speculation  about  the  appellant  supporting
      himself by selling drugs. It was arguable the judge did not adequately
      consider  the  appellant's  health  issues  when  carrying   out   the
      proportionality exercise.

   7. Miss Childs relied upon the grounds  for  which  permission  had  been
      granted. She submitted that the judge should not have  questioned  the
      relationship when this was undisputed by the respondent. She contended
      that in any event there was a wealth of photographs and other evidence
      before the judge as to the relationship and  that  the  findings  were
      perverse. Regarding suitability, the issue was whether his presence is
      conducive to the public good. He had one conviction and the  focus  by
      the judge was upon the nature of the offence. The appellant's  account
      was that he believed the conviction was spent and that  is  why  there
      was no disclosure. The judge had referred to the  appellant  supplying
      drugs whereas there was no conviction for this. She contended that the
      proportionality exercise  was  flawed.  The  appellant's  wife  was  a
      Christian which would cause them significant problems in Pakistan.

   8. In response, the presenting officer pointed out the  judge  was  aware
      the respondent had not challenged the relationship but  had  indicated
      to the appellant's representative concerns and invited them to a  call
      additional witnesses if required. He submitted that the conclusion was
      one that was open to the judge. Regarding suitability, this was  dealt
      with at paragraph 32 and 33 of the decision. He accepted that  it  was
      speculation that the appellant was dealing in drugs but this  did  not
      amount to a material error of law. He submitted that if  the  decision
      is taken as a whole, the outcome was sustainable.

   9. The appellant's  representative  confirmed  that  the  earlier  asylum
      decision was before the judge. She submitted that it was unfair of the
      judge to speculate that the appellant was dealing in  drugs  and  that
      this matter had not been put to the appellant. Regarding  his  private
      life, she submitted it  was  an  error  for  the  judge  not  to  have
      considered this in the context of the appellant's health issues.


Consideration

  10. I have been provided with the decision of Kalidas  (agreed  facts-best
      practice)[2012]  UKUT 00327. The guidance is that judges  should  only
      look behind  factual  concessions  in  exceptional  circumstances.  If
      evidence develops in such a way that the correctness of the concession
      needs to be revisited the judge must draw that to the attention of the
      representatives and an adjournment may be necessary.


  11. At paragraph 18 the judge records the appellant's  evidence  is  being
      his wife supported him from her earnings as a nanny. She earned  �2000
      per month. The judge noted that they were living in  Chelsea  and  the
      judge took judicial note of the fact this was  an  expensive  part  of
      London. There was no presenting officer in attendance  and  the  judge
      asked the appellant why,  if  money  was  tight,  they  did  not  live
      somewhere cheaper. His explanation  was  that  the  accommodation  was
      close to her place of employment. The appellant said that he had a car
      and would drive his wife to and from her place of work.


  12. His wife then gave evidence. It is not stated in the decision but  the
      normal practice would be for her to  remain  outside  whilst  he  gave
      evidence. The rationale behind this is that the  witness  cannot  then
      adapt their evidence to what was said by the earlier witness. I  would
      take it this practice has been followed. Notably, it was recorded that
      her evidence was she earned �26,000 per year. She said that their rent
      in Chelsea is �1750 per month. She also referred to another  part-time
      job. She said that she would travel to work by bus which would take 20
      min or on occasion walk, which would take 40 min.

  13. Clearly, from the recorded of the appellant's evidence at paragraph 18
      and his wife's evidence at paragraphs 19 to 22 there was inconsistency
      in the two accounts. The judge at paragraph 23 records that  following
      Miss Childs was advised that whilst the genuineness  of  the  marriage
      had not been raised in the refusal letter from the evidence before the
      judge it now had become an issue. The judge suggested  she  take  such
      measures as she sought suitable, including recalling witnesses.

  14. It is a basic principle that the parties are entitled to know the case
      they have to meet. The judge was entitled; in light  of  the  way  the
      evidence had developed, to question the respondent's  acceptance  that
      the marriage was genuine and subsisting. The judge quite properly drew
      this issue to the attention  of  the  appellant's  representative.  In
      principle, if  this  is  done  and  the  party  is  not  placed  at  a
      disadvantage there is no error of law. There was no application for an
      adjournment. Consequently, I conclude no material  error  of  law  has
      been established on the first ground.

  15. It is submitted that the judge's conclusion that the relationship  was
      not genuine was perverse. The judge refers to the disparity  in  their
      age: the appellant being 35 and his wife 61. The judge refers to their
      different nationalities with his wife being Filipino. At paragraph  30
      the judge pointed out they were not saying somebody older cannot  fall
      in love with somebody younger. However, the judge seeks to put matters
      in context by referring to the  appellant's  background;  the  various
      applications he had made to  remain;  and  the  inconsistency  in  the
      evidence. At paragraph 31 the judge  refers  to  the  photographs  and
      documents provided. The judge found they were taken  opportunistically
      in order to form the basis for an application  to  remain.  The  judge
      referred to the appellant having made five applications for  leave  to
      remain all of which had been  refused.  The  judge  concluded  he  was
      desperate to remain by any means. The conclusion was the  relationship
      had been manufactured with this aim in mind  and  was  based  upon  an
      economic transaction between the appellant and Ms Rivera  so  that  he
      could attempt once again to remain. It was a matter for the  judge  to
      evaluate  the  evidence  and  to  draw  any  inferences   which   were
      appropriate. I find no material error of law established.

  16. The judge was considering the appellant's article 8 rights through the
      prism of the rules. Under appendix FM this included  consideration  of
      his suitability.  The  respondent  had  found  his  presence  was  not
      conducive to the public  good.  This  can  be  evidenced  by  criminal
      convictions, character or other reasons. The decision referred to  the
      appellant having been convicted on  4  July  2014  which  he  had  not
      declared  in  his  application.  The  judge's  decision  refers  to  a
      conviction connected with an illegal drug, cannabis. The judge did not
      have the benefit of documentary evidence  about  the  conviction.  The
      appellant's account of the judge  dealing  with  the  criminal  charge
      telling him to plead guilty and he would receive a �15 fine and  would
      not have a criminal record is unbelievable. It was recorded by  First-
      tier Judge Chana that he continued to claim he was innocent  and  that
      the drug had been planted. The judge did not accept this as credible.

  17.  His  explanation  for  not  declaring  this  conviction  was  equally
      incredible. Paragraph 11 of the decision records  he  said  he  waited
      until his conviction was spent, notwithstanding his claim he was  told
      he would not have a criminal record. He  said  he  went  to  the  post
      office and provided his fingerprints to check if  he  had  a  criminal
      record and none was found. Such services  not  provided  by  the  post
      office.

  18. Whether his presence was conducive to the public good is not  confined
      to convictions but also includes his character. I note the decision of
      July 2009 on his asylum claim was  before  the  judge.  Paragraph  3.2
      refers to him being arrested  on  27  June  2009  by  the  police  for
      possession of  cannabis  and  for  overstaying  whereupon  he  claimed
      asylum.


  19. The judge noted the claim  was  that  the  appellant  had  no  income.
      However the  judge  found  the  claim  relationship  was  an  economic
      transaction in order to  help  the  appellant  stay  in  the  country.
      Consequently, he would not be supported by his  partner  has  claimed.
      The judge had regard  to  her  income  and  outgoings.  The  judge  at
      paragraph 35 concluded the appellant had his own income and said there
      may be a connection between his cannabis conviction and his ability to
      live in an expensive part of London. The judge refers to the appellant
      having an expensive lifestyle and that  cannabis  was  found  on  him,
      albeit he said he did not smoke cannabis. If he was not going to smoke
      it then an alternative was he was going to sell it. The judge drew  an
      inference from this. The judge does  not  make  specific  findings  on
      suitability but it can be taken this was considered material.  If  the
      comments  about  how  the  appellant  was  maintaining  his  lifestyle
      amounted to speculation I do not find they affect the outcome  of  the
      appeal.

  20. It was contended that the judge's assessment of the proportionality of
      the respondent's decision was flawed.  The  judge  did  not  find  the
      existence of family life. He had not been here for the length of  time
      specified in the rules. The grounds  for  permission  focus  upon  the
      appellant's mental health. There is  reference  to  him  having  post-
      traumatic stress relating to events in  Pakistan,  with  a  heightened
      risk of suicide if returned. The appeal decision in his asylum  appeal
      was back in July 2009 and the judge there accepts his claim  that  his
      wife and children and other family members had been murdered. However,
      the judge found that he could reasonably relocate.  There  was  little
      reference in First-tier Judge Chana's decision about  the  appellant's
      mental health beyond that  recorded  in  paragraph  13.  The  skeleton
      argument  before  the  judge  makes  limited  reference  to  this   at
      paragraphs 23 and 25. This will briefly referred  to  in  the  refusal
      letter  with  reference  to  treatment  available  in  Pakistan.   The
      impression is that his mental health was not the main  thrust  of  the
      appeal. I bear in mind the high threshold to succeed in such a  claim.
      Whilst  it  would  have  been  preferable  had  the   judge   referred
      specifically to this issue I do not find its omission   amounts  to  a
      material error.


  21. The judge did not have the benefit of presenting officer.  It  is  not
      apparent if the judge appreciated there was only a  limited  right  of
      appeal (Now see Charles (human rights appeal: scope) [2018] UKUT 00089
      (IAC)). This is not made clear in the skeleton  argument  provided  to
      the judge as it suggests the appeal is on all grounds. The  judge  was
      mistaken in this regard them given the outcome has  made  no  material
      difference.


  22. Although not mentioned in the application for leave I note  the  judge
      has not referred to the factors set out in section 117 B. Although  it
      is preferable to refer to this provision the spirit of  the  provision
      can be inferred (see AM(S117B)Malawi  [2015]  UKUT  0260.)  Given  the
      judge's findings about his marriage family life was  not  established.
      Section 117 B provides that little weight  should  be  afforded  to  a
      private life established when  here  unlawfully  or  when  a  person's
      situation was precarious. I note the appellant was able  to  give  his
      evidence in English and appears to have integrated. However given  the
      statutory provision on private life I do not find the judge's  failure
      to refer specifically to it will have made a material difference.  The
      judge does refer to the legitimate aim of immigration control and that
      the appellant can rebuild a private life in Pakistan.

  23.  My  conclusion  is  that  a  material  error  of  law  has  not  been
      established.



   Decision


   A material error of law in the decision of First-tier Judge Chana has not
   been established. Consequently, that decision dismissing the appeal shall
   stand
