Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1.  The  Appellant  is  a  national  of  Iraq  born  in  1995.   He  seeks
    international protection and leave on human rights grounds.

    Case History

 2. The Appellant claimed asylum on the 23rd September 2016. Protection was
    refused on the 25th April 2019 and the Appellant exercised his right of
    appeal before the First-tier Tribunal. His case came before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Dearden on the 12th June 2019. It  was  dismissed  by  a
    written decision promulgated on the 25th June 2019.

 3. The first  matter  in  issue  before  Judge  Dearden  was  whether  the
    Appellant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Iraq for reasons of
    his imputed political opinion.  The  factual  matrix  asserted  by  the
    Appellant was that his family are indelibly associated with the  regime
    of Saddam Hussain by virtue of his father's service in  the  army,  and
    latterly for Uday Hussain. That claimed  risk  was  rejected  by  Judge
    Dearden and permission to challenge his decision was refused  first  by
    First-tier Tribunal Woodcraft on the 23rd July 2019 and then  by  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Reeds on the 12th August 2019. I can therefore to say no
    more about that.

 4. The second issue before Judge Dearden was however whether the Appellant
    would face very significant obstacles to his integration  in  Iraq,  or
    even conditions of such destitution such that Article  3/Article  15(b)
    of the Qualification Directive would be engaged. The  Appellant  relied
    in particular on the fact that he has not lived in Iraq since he was  a
    young child and has no  identity  documents  or  family  there:  it  is
    accepted that he has lived in either the  UAE  or  the  United  Kingdom
    since 2003.  On this issue Judge Reeds was persuaded that  the  grounds
    were arguable and permission was granted on that point.

 5. The matter came before me on  the  16th  September  2019  and  for  the
    reasons I set out below under the heading 'Error  of  Law'  I  set  the
    decision of Judge Dearden aside to the limited extent identified.   The
    matter was then stayed pending the decision of the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    the new Iraq country guidance case.  There  followed  some  regrettable
    delay. The country guidance case became delayed and was not handed down
    until the 20th December 2019: SMO, KSP & IM  (Article  15(c);  identity
    documents) Iraq CG [2019] UKUT 00400 (IAC). The date earmarked for  the
    resumed hearing of this appeal then had to  be  abandoned  due  to  the
    Covid-19 emergency.  The hearing before me was on the  first  available
    date for a face-to-face  hearing.   I  heard  oral  evidence  from  the
    Appellant, and submissions from Mr Greer and Mr Diwnycz for which I  am
    grateful. I reserved my decision which I now  give  under  the  heading
    'The Decision Remade'.

    Error of Law

 6. The Appellant left Iraq for  the  United  Arab  Emirates  when  he  was
    approximately seven or eight years old.  He travelled with  his  family
    who were fleeing the country following the fall of Saddam - this  would
    have been in approximately 2003.  Because he was a young child  he  had
    not at that point been issued with his own CSID.  He states that he has
    to date never held a CSID, and he asserts that he has no  relatives  in
    Iraq who would be able to assist him in obtaining one. As such he would
    be unable to work, receive government or  non-governmental  assistance,
    or secure accommodation. His case before the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    therefore that he would face significant obstacles  in  integration  in
    Iraq such that his removal there would be disproportionate.

 7. Of this argument the First-tier Tribunal said this.  The  Appellant  is
    educated, resourceful and able to work. He has a passport and so  could
    use the details therein to obtain an identity card.  His family in  the
    UAE could support him. He speaks fluent Arabic. These factors  indicate
    that he is not actually going to find  himself  destitute  homeless  or
    otherwise in difficulty that would render his removal a breach  of  any
    of the United Kingdom's obligations.

 8. Having heard from both parties I find that  in  its  analysis  on  this
    point the First-tier Tribunal erred in two material respects.

 9. At its paragraph 35(8) the Tribunal says  this:  "The  Appellant  still
    retains his father's phone  number  and  email  address  and  there  is
    nothing in  the  short  term  to  stop  him  availing  himself  of  his
    assistance from the United Arab Emirates whilst he is  in  Iraq".  This
    was a  key  part  of  the  reasoning  on  the  Appellant's  ability  to
    reintegrate and establish himself in Iraq. It was obviously  important,
    since financial  security  would  go  a  long  way  to  addressing  the
    arguments put on the Appellant's behalf about the difficulties that  he
    might face in Baghdad today. I am satisfied that in making that finding
    the First-tier Tribunal has failed to address material evidence on  the
    point, namely the Appellant's evidence that he has fallen out with  his
    father following his parents' divorce, and that as such  any  financial
    assistance is unlikely to be forthcoming.    The  Tribunal  alludes  to
    this evidence at its paragraph 35(7) but nowhere  makes  a  finding  on
    whether it is accepted.  The failure to  take  material  evidence  into
    account, and the failing to make findings on it, are material errors of
    law.

10. The second problem is this. The Appellant, it is accepted, is  a  young
    single Sunni male who has absolutely no experience of living in Baghdad
    apart from as a very young child.  As such it was  incumbent  upon  the
    Tribunal to give some consideration to the relevant county guidance  on
    conditions in the capital: BA (returns to Baghdad) Iraq CG [2017]  UKUT
    0018 (IAC).   Whilst the matters identified by the First-tier  Tribunal
    here - the Appellant's fluency of Arabic and his  potential  possession
    of a CSID - were obviously relevant, they were  not  the  only  factors
    that required consideration.   There  was  for  instance  the  risk  of
    kidnapping for a young man who might be considered a  wealthy  returnee
    from the diaspora, and importantly the fact that he  is  a  Sunni  male
    without any support or familial links to the  city.  As  such  whatever
    difficulties he might encounter in Baghdad,  he  would  not  receive  a
    sufficiency of protection from the Iraqi state: headnote (vii)  of  BA.
    The failure  to  consider  those  matters  renders  the  assessment  on
    276ADE(1) incomplete.

11. For those reasons the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

    The Decision Remade

12. I am guided in my decision by two country guidance decisions:  SMO  and
    BA (Returns to Baghdad).  I was further referred to the June 2020  CPIN
    Iraq: Internal relocation, civil documentation and returns. It was  not
    in the end necessary for me to have regard to any of the  materials  in
    the Appellant's bundle.

13. In terms of the factual matrix to be applied, it  is  as  follows.  The
    Appellant is a male born into an Arab Sunni family in Baghdad in  1995.
    He left Iraq in 2003 and has not been there since.  The Home Office are
    agreed to be in possession of his valid Iraqi  passport  (expiry  2023)
    but despite a reference alluding to the possibility that the file  also
    contains an identity card of some description, none has  been  produced
    and the Appellant denies all knowledge of what that  might  be.  Having
    heard  from  the  Appellant,  and  having  had  regard  to   the   many
    opportunities that the Home Office has had to produce such a  document,
    I am satisfied that it is reasonably likely that  the  reference  is  a
    mistake and that no CSID or similar is held on file.

14. In respect of the Appellant's language skills I accept that  he  speaks
    English and fluent Arabic, although given the young age that  he  moved
    to the UAE I accept that  it  is  likely  that  this  will  be  with  a
    detectable Emirati  'international'  accent  as  opposed  to  a  native
    Baghdad one. Given the length of time that  he  has  been  out  of  the
    country I  further  accept  that  it  is  reasonably  likely  that  the
    Appellant has no relatives in Iraq to whom he could turn for support.

15. In his cross examination of the Appellant Mr  Diwnycz  identified  that
    the Appellant had moved house without  telling  the  Home  Office.  The
    Appellant said that he had been ejected from his NASS accommodation and
    that he had therefore gone to live with his girlfriend. He was  advised
    to call the Migrant Helpline which he did  but  never  managed  to  get
    through.  Then by the time he spoke to his solicitor, who told  him  to
    go his reporting centre and tell them he had moved, Covid  has  started
    and he was worried about going so he left it. Mr Diwnycz  asked  me  to
    infer from this that the Appellant was not particularly  interested  in
    complying with the requirements placed upon him by the Home Office, and
    asked me to find that the  Appellant's  behaviour  generally  detracted
    from his reliability as a  witness.  I  have  borne  that  in  mind  in
    determining the only real  credibility  issue  arising  in  submissions
    before me: whether the Appellant  could  expect  to  receive  financial
    assistance from his family in UAE.

16. The Appellant's evidence on the matter is that  his  relationship  with
    his dad was already difficult when he came to  the  United  Kingdom  to
    study in 2016: his father disapproved of  him  for  "various  reasons".
    After the Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom his parents' marriage
    went through a crisis and the Appellant  sided  with  his  mother.  His
    father has not spoken to him  since,  and  has  provided  him  with  no
    assistance, either by way of more evidence for the claim as  originally
    advanced (see my �3 above) or financially. In response to Mr  Diwnycz's
    questions the Appellant pointed out that if his father was helping  him
    he would not have had to live in NASS  accommodation  or  rely  on  the
    voucher scheme.   Even taking into account the fact that Judge  Dearden
    dismissed the claim as originally  advanced,  and  that  the  Appellant
    failed to notify the Home Office of his new address, I am satisfied  to
    the  lower  standard  that  the  account  of  estrangement   from   the
    Appellant's father is likely to be true. It is a matter about which the
    Appellant has been consistent,  even  when  his  claim  relied  on  his
    father's claimed Ba'athist links. Had  he  been  in  contact  with  his
    father he could for  instance  have  asked  him  to  provide  a  letter
    confirming his claims; as it was he had to make do with the very  brief
    note from his sister which appears  at  page  37  of  the  Respondent's
    bundle.  Had he been in contact with his father, who is it  would  seem
    living in relative comfort in the UAE, he  would  no  doubt  have  been
    receiving some financial  assistance,  and  would  not  have  found  it
    necessary to live in the less than luxurious accommodation  offered  by
    NASS in Hull.

17. It is against that factual background that  I  consider  the  situation
    faced by the Appellant upon his return to Iraq.

18. Mr Greer places reliance on the following  extracts  from  the  country
    guidance given in SMO:

         "...

         The CSID is being replaced with  a  new  biometric  Iraqi  National
         Identity Card - the INID.  As a general matter, it is necessary for
         an individual to have one of these two documents in order  to  live
         and travel within Iraq without encountering treatment or conditions
         which are contrary to Article 3 ECHR.   Many of the checkpoints  in
         the country are manned by Shia militia who are  not  controlled  by
         the GOI and are unlikely to permit an individual without a CSID  or
         an INID to pass.  A valid  Iraqi  passport  is  not  recognised  as
         acceptable proof of identity for internal travel.

         ....

         Once in Iraq, it remains the case that an individual is expected to
         attend their local CSA office in  order  to  obtain  a  replacement
         document.  All CSA offices have now re-opened, although the  extent
         to which records have been destroyed by the conflict with  ISIL  is
         unclear, and is likely  to  vary  significantly  depending  on  the
         extent and intensity of the conflict in the area in question.

         An individual returnee who is not from Baghdad is not likely to  be
         able to obtain a replacement  document  there,  and  certainly  not
         within a reasonable time.  Neither  the  Central  Archive  nor  the
         assistance facilities for IDPs are likely to  render  documentation
         assistance to an undocumented returnee.

         The likelihood of obtaining a replacement identity document by  the
         use of a proxy, whether from the UK  or  on  return  to  Iraq,  has
         reduced due to the introduction of the INID system.   In  order  to
         obtain an INID, an individual must attend their local CSA office in
         person to enrol their biometrics, including fingerprints  and  iris
         scans.  The CSA offices in which INID terminals have been installed
         are unlikely - as a result of the phased replacement  of  the  CSID
         system - to issue a CSID, whether to an individual in person or  to
         a proxy.   The  reducing  number  of  CSA  offices  in  which  INID
         terminals have not been installed will continue to issue  CSIDs  to
         individuals and their proxies  upon  production  of  the  necessary
         information."

19. He further places reliance on the findings in BA (Returns to  Baghdad).
    Although this is technically no longer country  guidance  (all  earlier
    decisions having been replaced by SMO) there was  no  issue  before  me
    that the findings therein continue to be helpful when  considering  the
    position of a Sunni returnee to the city:

         "Kidnapping has been, and remains,  a  significant  and  persistent
         problem contributing to the breakdown of law  and  order  in  Iraq.
         Incidents of kidnapping are likely to be underreported. Kidnappings
         might  be  linked  to  a  political  or  sectarian  motive;   other
         kidnappings are rooted in criminal activity for a purely  financial
         motive. Whether a returnee from the West is likely to be  perceived
         as a potential target for kidnapping in Baghdad may depend  on  how
         long he or she has been away from Iraq.  Each  case  will  be  fact
         sensitive, but in principle, the longer a person has  spent  abroad
         the greater the risk. However, the evidence does not  show  a  real
         risk to a returnee in Baghdad on this ground alone.

         Sectarian violence has increased since  the  withdrawal  of  US-led
         coalition forces in 2012, but is not at the levels  seen  in  2006-
         2007. A Shia dominated government is supported by Shia militias  in
         Baghdad. The evidence indicates that Sunni men are more  likely  to
         be targeted as suspected supporters of Sunni extremist groups  such
         as ISIL. However, Sunni identity alone is not  sufficient  to  give
         rise to a real risk of serious harm.

         Individual characteristics, which do not  in  themselves  create  a
         real risk of serious harm on return to Baghdad, might amount  to  a
         real risk for the purpose of the Refugee Convention, Article  15(c)
         of the Qualification Directive or Article 3 of the ECHR if assessed
         on a cumulative basis. The assessment will depend on the  facts  of
         each case.

         In general, the authorities in Baghdad are unable, and in the  case
         of Sunni complainants,  are  likely  to  be  unwilling  to  provide
         sufficient protection."

20. The first matter arising is whether the Appellant would be able to  get
    a CSID before he leaves the United Kingdom. In his evidence to a series
    of country guidance panels (AA, AAH, SMO)  Dr  Fatah  has  consistently
    described this as a  feat  that  although  not  impossible,  is  fairly
    difficult. Those difficulties would be compounded  in  the  Appellant's
    case by his lack of family in Iraq itself, and  his  estrangement  from
    the head of his family, his father.  I need not  go  into  any  further
    detail on this point however, because Mr Diwnycz realistically conceded
    that he would be unable to argue  to  the  contrary,  given  the  clear
    policy statement at [2.6.16] of the latest CPIN: "it is highly unlikely
    that an individual would be able  to  obtain  a  CSID  from  the  Iraqi
    Embassy while in the UK".

21. The next question is whether the Appellant would be able to  leave  the
    environs of the airport, as discussed in AAH. Unlike  the  claimant  in
    that case, who had to travel all the way to the IKR, the Appellant only
    need make it as far as the city. Mr Greer conceded that on the basis of
    the findings at �347 of SMO, he would be able  to  do  this  using  his
    passport.

22. I am satisfied that the Appellant can therefore  get  back  to  Baghdad
    without any real difficulties. Once there, however, things become  more
    challenging.

23. In respect of whether the  Appellant  could  obtain  new  documentation
    within a reasonable time frame Mr Greer referred me to the findings  in
    SMO, and the evidence replicated in the new CPIN. As set out above  the
    Tribunal recorded that the Iraqi authorities are now replacing the  old
    paper-based CSID system with a digital card.   At  the  date  of  SMO's
    appeal this system was being rolled out across the country and  it  was
    hoped that the new system would be universally in use  by  the  end  of
    2019.  The Tribunal did not feel able to give a list of  the  locations
    at which new 'INID' terminals have been installed but  it  appeared  to
    endorse the position of the Respondent [at �389] that the new terminals
    were now operational in most cities and that it  was  only  in  "rural"
    locations that the old CSID system persisted.  Before  me  the  parties
    therefore proceeded on the assumption that Baghdad would  be  operating
    the new system.

24. Dr Fatah's evidence, accepted by the Tribunal, about how to  obtain  an
    INID is set out from �364 of SMO (the bracketed references  are  to  Dr
    Fatah's own report):

         "364.    Dr Fatah stated that the  INID  process  was  centralised,
         whereas the CSID process was regional: [950].   The  procedure  for
         obtaining the new card was that the individual would  go  to  their
         local Civil Status Affairs Office and provide their CSID,  INC  and
         Residency Card, although the document of a close male relative  may
         also be used (as it would enable the entry in the Family Book to be
         located).  The scribe who took the applicant's details  would  send
         the application form to the relevant office and present a  copy  to
         the applicant.  The applicant would be required  to  provide  their
         photograph, an iris scan and fingerprints in order to complete  the
         application process.  It would take  two  weeks  for  the  INID  to
         become available.  The application had to be made in person due  to
         the need to provide iris scans and fingerprints, although it  could
         then be collected by a proxy: [953]-[954].  Dr  Fatah  provided  an
         image of a redacted card and explained the security features in the
         document: [955]-[958].

         365. At [960]-[967], Dr Fatah stated that there were  a  number  of
         difficulties  associated  with  issuing  documents.   Civil  Status
         Affairs Offices  had  been  destroyed  and  many  people  had  been
         displaced without their documents.  The Iraqi authorities were  not
         managing the  problem and the lack of good calibre  civil  servants
         was an ongoing problem.  Restrictions on IDP movement  had  further
         compounded the difficulties.  The UNHCR had recognised the severity
         of the problem, describing undocumented individuals as being  in  a
         'legal limbo', and had assisted some 2,500 Iraqis  whose  documents
         had become lost or destroyed. Courts had been set up  within  camps
         to  provide  certificates  of  births,  deaths  and  marriages  and
         notaries had been sent to camps so that they could be granted power
         of attorney  and  assist  with  documentation  problems.   No  such
         procedures had been  put  in  place  for  returnees  and  Dr  Fatah
         believed that this was because the Iraqi authorities believed their
         situation to be "trivial".

         366. Dr Fatah did not believe that a CSID could  be  obtained  from
         abroad any more, since it had been replaced by the INID.  At [968]-
         [980], however, he described how a CSID could have been obtained in
         the past from an embassy.  At [981]-[984], he describes the process
         for applying for a passport and at [985]-[990],  he  considers  the
         Laissez Passer.  At [991]-[100], he considers whether it  would  be
         possible  to  instruct  a   lawyer   to   assist   with   obtaining
         documentation in Iraq,  emphasising that this would not  assist  in
         the case of the INID and that the applicant would, in the case of a
         CSID, still be required to know their page and ledger  number.   An
         individual's family might be able to assist even if a lawyer  could
         not, and would not need power of attorney."

25. I note that this accords with the information provided to the Secretary
    of State by DFAT and set out  in  the  CPIN  at  [5.6.1]  and  [5.6.2].
    Having had regard to that evidence I am satisfied that it is reasonably
    likely that the Appellant will find it impossible to obtain valid Iraqi
    identity documentation within a reasonable time frame. Although he  has
    an asset in the form of his passport, he  has  none  of  the  documents
    necessary (a CSID, INC and residency card); nor does  he  have  a  male
    relative there who may be able to assist  him  with  the  process.   In
    light of the Respondent's concession in SMO to the effect that  someone
    in that position faces a real risk of destitution such that  Article  3
    ECHR/Article 15(b) of the Qualification Directive would be  engaged,  I
    need go no further, since the appeal must be allowed on that basis.

26. I would however add this.  The  difficulties  that  this  Appellant  is
    likely to encounter  as  an  undocumented  returnee  are  significantly
    compounded  by  three  personal  characteristics,  each  of  which  are
    considered by the Tribunal in BA. First he is a young Sunni male and as
    such vulnerable to discrimination  by  the  largely  Shi'a  population,
    making any kind of informal employment (ie where an employer,  contrary
    to the law, employs undocumented individuals on a  day  to  day  basis)
    even more unlikely. That same characteristic leaves him  vulnerable  to
    worse treatment at checkpoints.  Second as a man who left Baghdad as  a
    very young child he has absolutely no idea how that city  operates.  Mr
    Diwnycz suggested that in this regard  he  might  be  assisted  by  his
    mother, who could advise him by telephone. The difficulty with that  is
    that seventeen years of brutal conflict and  sectarian  violence  means
    that the Baghdad of today is a very different place  from  the  Baghdad
    that this family left in 2003. The Appellant may  have  demonstrated  a
    degree of resourcefulness in adjusting to life in the United Kingdom  -
    where he is protected and supported by the state  -  but  adjusting  to
    life in Baghdad, with no  such  support,  would  be  a  very  different
    proposition.  Third,  it will be evident to anyone who hears him  speak
    that he is not 'from' there. The Appellant has grown  up  in  the  very
    international community in the  UAE  where  Arabic  is  spoken  with  a
    discernibly different accent from that spoken in Baghdad.  He  will  be
    readily identifiable as a returnee who has spent a considerable  amount
    of time abroad, rendering him even more vulnerable to  crimes  such  as
    kidnap and extortion.

27. For all of those reasons I am satisfied that the appeal must be allowed
    on protection (Article  15(b))  and  human  rights  grounds  (paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules).

    Anonymity Order

28. This appeal concerns a claim for protection.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decisions

29. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law and it
    is set aside to the extent identified above.

30. The appeal is allowed on protection and human rights grounds.

31. There is an order for anonymity.
