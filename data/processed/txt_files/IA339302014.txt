For the Respondent:    Mr F Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Brazil and his date of birth is 29  March
    1987.

2.   On 6 June 2014 the appellant made an application for a  residence  card
    pursuant to the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2006
    as the family member of an EEA national.  The appellant's case is  that
    he  is  married  to  an  Italian  citizen,  Michelle  Dos  Reis.    The
    application was refused by the Secretary of State in a  decision  of  8
    August 2014.  The decision maker did not accept that the  EEA  national
    sponsor was exercising treaty rights.  The decision  maker  noted  that
    the appellant had submitted a marriage  certificate  establishing  that
    the appellant and the sponsor were married and it  indicated  that  the
    appellant's previous marriage was dissolved; however, the appellant had
    not produced a divorce certificate.  For this  reason  the  application
    was refused.

3.   The appellant appealed and his appeal was determined,  on  the  papers,
    at the request of the appellant, by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Pacey and dismissed in a decision of 19 November 2014.   The  appellant
    made an application for permission to appeal which was granted by Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal Kelly in a decision of 20 January 2014.

4.   The Judge had before her the appellant's witness statement in which  he
    asserted that he presented his  divorce  certificate  to  the  registry
    office prior to his marriage to the sponsor.  He attached this  to  his
    statement and it was before the First-tier Tribunal Judge.   The  Judge
    made the following findings:

         "10. I have a document in what I take to be Portuguese  (given  the
             appellant's nationality) which includes  the  word  'divorco'.
             However, the document is untranslated and I  cannot  therefore
             accept it in evidence.  Paragraph 11.  I understand the  logic
             of the appellant's argument that  the  register  office  would
             require to see proof of his divorce but I cannot  assume  that
             this was done.  In any event the register office would require
             a translated document.  I have none.  I  cannot  therefore  be
             satisfied that the appellant is validly  married  to  his  EEA
             sponsor".

5.   The Judge went on to accept the appellant's  evidence  in  relation  to
    the sponsor's employment.  She found that the  sponsor  was  exercising
    treaty rights; however, she did  not  accept  that  the  appellant  had
    established that his marriage was dissolved.

The Grounds of Appeal and Oral Submissions

6.   The grounds of appeal assert that the registry office  would  not  have
    married the appellant and  the  sponsor  without  having  accepted  the
    divorce certificate as evidence that his  previous  marriage  had  been
    dissolved.   In  oral  submissions  Mr  Khan  relied  on  his  skeleton
    argument.  The thrust of the grounds seeking  permission  is  that  the
    Judge applied a too high standard of proof and permission to appeal was
    granted on this basis.  Mr Walker made oral submissions indicating that
    the Rule 24 response was drafted without the author having had sight of
    the papers.  He conceded that the Judge had applied a too high standard
    of proof given that the appellant and the sponsor had lawfully  married
    in the UK and it had been accepted by the registrar that the  appellant
    was divorced on production of his Portuguese certificate.

Error of Law

7.   In my view the Judge materially erred because she applied  a  too  high
    standard of proof in failing to treat a marriage certificate (issued in
    the UK as an official public record)  as  sufficient  evidence  of  the
    legal dissolution of the appellant's previous marriage and by requiring
    a translated document relating to the dissolution  of  the  appellant's
    previous marriage.  It was the only issue raised by the respondent  and
    there was no challenge to the  credibility  of  the  appellant  or  the
    sponsor generally. It was not suggested at any time by  the  respondent
    that the marriage  certificate  was  not  genuine.   I  set  aside  the
    decision to dismiss the appeal under the 2006  Regulations.   I  remake
    the decision and allow the appeal under the 2006 Regulations.

8.   No anonymity direction is made.
