For the Respondent:    Mr D Coleman, Counsel instructed by Eden Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision by Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal Atreya heard on 1 July 2015. In  a  decision
    promulgated on 20 August 2015, she allowed the appeal. The  Respondent,
    to whom I shall refer as the Claimant, is a national of Pakistan,  born
    on 1 January 1968.  She made an  application  for  entry  clearance  in
    order to join her spouse  in  the  United  Kingdom,  her  spouse  being
    originally a national of Pakistan but now British, born on 11  February
    1938.  This application was refused by an Entry Clearance Officer on 10
    September 2014 both in respect of Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules
    and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human  Rights.  Grounds  of
    appeal were submitted to the Entry Clearance Officer on 17 October 2014
    and an Entry Clearance Manager conducted a review on  29  January  2015
    but upheld the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer.

 2. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal  Judge,  the  Sponsor  Mr
    Bashir gave evidence as to his  relationship  with  his  wife  and  the
    reasons why he said it was not possible for him  to  live  in  Pakistan
    with her.  The  judge  heard  submissions  by  both  parties  and  made
    findings of fact from [29] through to [51] of her decision.  She  found
    at [30] that the Sponsor was a credible and truthful witness,  that  he
    was 77 years of age and she accepted his evidence  as  to  why  he  had
    married his wife and why he wanted her to come to the  United  Kingdom.
    She  accepted  at  [31]  that  there  was  a  genuine  and   subsisting
    relationship between the two and  their  communication  was  mainly  by
    telephone on a regular basis.   She  also  accepted  that  the  Sponsor
    remitted  money  to  his  wife,  in  Pakistan,  that  the  Sponsor  was
    westernised from the way he dressed and the fact he  gave  evidence  in
    fluent English.  She noted also and found that he had  only  spent  two
    months in Pakistan since he came to the United Kingdom in 1963.

 3. She also accepted at [32] based  on  the  medical  evidence,  that  the
    Sponsor has some serious health issues, in particular  he  has  chronic
    obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes and  he  needs  to  take
    bronchodilators  for  relief  daily,  he  has  chronic  lumbar   spinal
    spondylosis, chronic eczema, TIA and is at risk of  a  possible  stroke
    and also has chronic kidney disease, stage 3 and she  referred  to  the
    medical report by Dr Lamba who is the Sponsor's long-term GP.

 4. She noted that the Sponsor receives ï¿½12,740 per year by way of a  state
    pension and found that the application did not meet the requirements of
    the Immigration Rules.  However  the  judge  noted  at  [37]  that  the
    Claimant is a seamstress and that she has the  skills  and  ability  to
    integrate into UK society including the ability to work as well as care
    for her husband were she to be admitted.

 5. The judge considered Article 8 of  the  European  Convention  on  Human
    Rights from [39] onwards and correctly directed herself in  respect  of
    the relevant case law at [39] and [40] where she made express reference
    to the Court of Appeal decision in SS (Congo), concluding at [102] that
    Article 8 was fact sensitive and it was disproportionate not  to  admit
    the Claimant.  She  also  referred  at  [48]  to  the  public  interest
    pursuant to Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002 and concluded overall that the Entry Clearance Officer's  decision
    was disproportionate.

 6. The Entry Clearance Officer sought permission to appeal on 3  September
    2015.  There were essentially  three  grounds  of  appeal.   The  first
    ground  was  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge's   decision   was
    inadequately reasoned and irrational on the basis that it was not clear
    what disruption would result to family life between the Sponsor and the
    Claimant given that they do not currently live together.

 7. The second ground was with reference to the  judge's  finding  at  [49]
    where she held, "there is no sufficient public interest to justify  the
    interference with the Appellant's family life that  would  result  from
    her removal.  Consequently I find her removal  to  be  unjustified  and
    disproportionate", the point being that the appeal  was  a  refusal  of
    entry clearance and there was never any question of removal.

 8. The third ground was that it was an error of law to find there  was  no
    sufficient public interest as the public interest is clearly defined in
    Section 117 of the aforementioned NIAA 2002.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Frankish on  22  December  2015.   At  paragraph  3  of  the  grant  of
    permission he stated, "the grounds as confirmed in  the  determination,
    demonstrate that it is arguable that this appeal has been treated as  a
    removal case when it is an entry clearance case".  That  was  the  only
    ground in respect of which permission to appeal was granted.

    Hearing

10. At the hearing before me the Sponsor  attended  and  the  Claimant  was
    represented by Mr Coleman.  I heard submissions from Mr Tufan  as  well
    as Mr Coleman.  Mr Tufan sought to expand  or  extend  the  grounds  of
    appeal.  However whilst I heard his submission I declined to  give  him
    permission to do that because the issues he sought  to  raise  had  not
    been raised in respect of the grounds of appeal of 3 September 2015 nor
    had permission been granted in respect of them by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Frankish.  There  had  not  been  any  prior  application  before
    today's date to extend the  grounds  of  appeal  either  and  in  those
    circumstances I did not consider that it would  be  fair  or  just,  in
    light of the overriding objective, to  permit  further  grounds  to  be
    raised.  Consequently Mr Tufan essentially relied  on  the  grounds  of
    appeal as drafted.

11. I heard helpful submissions from Mr Coleman in support of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

     Decision

12. I find there was no material error of law in the decision of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Atreya.  It is clear from the decision as a  whole  that
    the judge had well in mind the fact that  she  was  hearing  an  appeal
    against the refusal of entry clearance.  She expressly states  that  at
    [4] and [7] of the decision and in respect of her findings reference is
    expressly made to the refusal of entry  clearance  at  [44]  and  [46].
    Paragraph 46 provides:

         "I  find  that  the  entry  clearance  refusal  did  amount  to   a
         disproportionate interference with the Appellant's right to respect
         for family life.  It  therefore  amounted  to  an  Article  8  ECHR
         breach.  Without entry clearance the Appellant's right to enjoy her
         family life with her  husband  will  be  disrupted.  It  is  in  my
         judgment a disproportionate interference taking  into  account  and
         balancing  the  Respondent's  interest  in  maintaining  the  entry
         clearance refusal and the Appellant's circumstances."

13. Consequently I accept the submission by Mr Coleman that essentially the
    reference to removal at [49] is simply a typographical error given  the
    paragraphs that preceded that  final  paragraph.   I  also  accept  his
    submission that the judge's direction and analysis is  detailed,  sound
    and legally correct.

14. For the avoidance of doubt although permission was not given in respect
    of the other grounds, I do not consider that  there  is  any  merit  in
    them, in particular as indicated earlier, the judge had express  regard
    to the public interest at [48] of her decision  and  she  clearly  gave
    detailed  reasons  for  her  decision,  which   are   not   irrational.
    Therefore, for the reasons set out above,  I  uphold  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Atreya.

15.  The appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer is dismissed.  I  uphold  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Atreya.

    No anonymity direction is made.
