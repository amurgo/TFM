Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Rene
For the Respondent:    Mr Wilding


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen  of  Jamaica  born  in  1998.   He  appeals
      against a decision of the Entry Clearance Officer made on  9  February
      2015 to refuse to grant him entry clearance as the child of  a  person
      with limited leave to remain in the UK  under  paragraph  301  of  the
      Immigration Rules.  The application was made on 6 November 2014.   His
      mother had limited leave to remain until 12 February 2017. She appears
      subsequently to have been granted indefinite leave to remain.

   2. The respondent refused the application considering that  the  evidence
      provided by the appellant did  not  show  that  his  mother  had  sole
      responsibility  for  him.   Also,  insufficient  evidence   had   been
      submitted to satisfy the maintenance requirement.


   3. He appealed.


      First tier hearing


   4. Following a hearing at Harmondsworth Judge of  the  First-Tier  Howard
      dismissed the appeal in a decision promulgated on 9 March 2017.


   5. He heard evidence from  the  appellant's  mother,  Charmaine  Angelika
      Edwards and his older brother, Sanishan Lorenzo Williams.


   6. The judge's findings are stated to be from paragraph [12ff].  In  fact
      [12] to [17] are  a  summary  of  the  mother's  oral  evidence.   The
      findings in respect of  sole  responsibility  are  at  [18]  to  [20].
      Having noted her evidence that the appellant had a lack of  attendance
      at school and her response that she had raised this with the school in
      2011 and 2014 and that it was due  to  his  having  to  care  for  his
      grandmother, looking after her and washing her, he  found  that  "this
      explanation did not appear to  have  made  its  way  into  the  school
      reports"[18].


   7. At [19] "asked some more prosaic questions such as whether  he  had  a
      girlfriend.  Tellingly her answer was 'not that he has said'".


   8. At [20], having earlier noted her evidence  that  she  has  made  five
      trips to Jamaica to visit him between 2011 and date  of  decision  and
      had made a number of money transfers to a friend for  the  appellant's
      education and upbringing, the judge stated that while it was  accepted
      that "she assists financially and has an active interest in what he is
      doing", the evidence did "not establish that she has played a role  in
      any of this.  Rather it seems that the appellant and  his  grandmother
      have forged a life together of mutual support.  Her knowledge  of  the
      more personal aspects of the appellant's  life  was  entirely  missing
      from her evidence".  The judge "did not find her a convincing  witness
      on this issue".


   9. Moving on (at [21]) to consider serious and compelling family or other
      considerations that made exclusion undesirable in  particular  whether
      there was evidence of neglect or abuse,  or  unmet  needs,  the  judge
      found that there  were  none  such,  indeed,  the  appellant  "on  the
      threshold of manhood appears very well integrated into  his  immediate
      environment as it  is  one  of  the  complaints  of  the  school  when
      addressing attendance that he appears to spend too much time  focussed
      on socialising rather than studying".


  10. The judge in further  considering  the  rules  examined  the  mother's
      finances finding (at [24]) that for the year 2014 to 2015  she  had  a
      total income of �4,344.  Also, her most recent bank statement showed a
      debit balance in excess of �1,000.


  11. Finally, in considering Article 8, having found there is  family  life
      and that the refusal to grant  entry  clearance  interfered  with  the
      ambition of the appellant and his mother to live together in  the  UK,
      the judge considered that such interference did not have  consequences
      of such gravity as potentially to engage Article 8.  Between 1999  and
      2011 the appellant and his mother were content that family life should
      be enjoyed at arms length.  She made the conscious decision to  pursue
      her life in the UK without him.  As such they were "content  that  the
      family life they enjoyed throughout that period  was  one  with  which
      both was satisfied".  She could continue to  make  visits  to  him  in
      Jamaica.


  12. The appellant sought permission to appeal  which  was  granted  on  27
      October 2017.


      Error of law hearing


  13. The crux of Mr Rene's submission was that the judge failed to consider
      a supplementary statement (dated 9 February  2017)  by  the  appellant
      which detailed the activities which the sponsor  said  showed  support
      for her claim to  have  had  sole  responsibility.   Also,  there  was
      evidence before the judge to show that the maintenance requirement was
      satisfied.  He added that in respect of the finances, contrary to  the
      respondent's assertion, original documents had been submitted but  had
      been returned by the respondent to the solicitor.  He asked  that  the
      case be  remitted  for  rehearing  as  the  failure  to  consider  the
      supplementary witness statement muddied the  waters  in  making  clear
      findings.


  14. Mr Wilding agreed that if material error was found the case should  be
      reheard so the findings can be made afresh.   However,  he  questioned
      whether the decision showed material error.  The judge in his findings
      had referenced the statements.  He had  reached  findings  which  were
      open to him on the evidence.  In respect of finances there appeared to
      be an absence of documents.


      Consideration


  15. I consider that the decision does  show  error.   The  issue  of  sole
      responsibility is one of fact. The  judge  (at  [6])  noted  that  the
      mother adopted "her signed statements" (emphasis added).  However,  in
      his somewhat  sparse  findings  on  sole  responsibility  he  made  no
      reference to  the  contents  in  the  supplementary  statement.   Such
      included that she takes the important  decisions  in  the  appellant's
      life including choosing the school, doing her research,  having  sight
      of the school reports,  visiting  the  school  when  in  Jamaica,  and
      keeping in touch with the school by telephone from the UK.   She  also
      referred to the appellant's health in 2014 and to taking  him  to  the
      doctor.  She further referred to frequent communication with  him  and
      that it is from her that he seeks permission about certain activities.
      Moreover, she referred to her financial position,  her  earnings  from
      self employment and to the amount of money spent by her per  month  on
      the appellant's upkeep.


  16. As indicated the judge stated  (at  [20])  that  in  considering  sole
      responsibility by the mother  "... the totality of the  evidence  does
      not satisfy me about this."


  17. I consider that in reaching that conclusion  the  judge's  failure  to
      refer to and make findings on the evidence contained in the  sponsor's
      supplementary statement constitutes a material error of law.  I  would
      add that although the judge noted that the appellant's brother adopted
      his statement and gave oral evidence and was cross examined, there  is
      no indication of what that amounted to. He makes no reference  to,  or
      analysis of that evidence either.


  18. In respect of maintenance the evidence is not wholly clear.   However,
      in her supplementary statement she refers to working as  self-employed
      and receiving income in excess of what the judge found (at [24]).   In
      addition she received benefits. In  the  voluminous  bundle  that  was
      before the judge there appears also  to  be  evidence  of  savings.  I
      consider the failure by the judge to refer to and make findings on the
      financial evidence referred to in the supplementary statement also  to
      be an error.


  19. In the circumstances, as both parties agreed  if  material  error  was
      found, the appropriate course is for the case to be  remitted  to  the
      First-Tier Tribunal  for  fresh  consideration  in  terms  of  section
      12(2)(b)(i) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007  and  of
      Practice Statement 7.2.


Notice of Decision


  20. The decision of the First-Tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
      error of law and I set it aside.  No findings of fact are preserved.

  21. The case is remitted to the First tier Tribunal to  be  reheard  by  a
      judge other than Judge Howard.


No anonymity order made.
