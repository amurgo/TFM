Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the continuation of an appeal by the Appellant,  a  citizen  of
    Nigeria born on 5 October 1960, against the determination of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Wyman in  which  the  Judge  dismissed  the  Appellant's
    appeal both against the Secretary of State's  decision  to  refuse  his
    application for indefinite leave to  remain  on  the  grounds  of  long
    residence and on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

 2. The Appellant's application was made on 7 February 2004 and refused  by
    reference to paragraphs 276B, 276ADE,  277B  and  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules (HC395) on 1 November 2013.  The Appellant  exercised
    his right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal and this is  the  appeal
    which came before Judge Wyman on 12 March 2014 and was  dismissed.  The
    Appellant applied for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.   The
    application was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Landes  on  8  May
    2014.

 3. Following a hearing in the Upper Tribunal on 20 June 2014 I found  that
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge in respect of  Article  8
    ECHR involved the making of a material error of law  and  I  set  aside
    that decision  to  be  remade  by  the  Upper  Tribunal.  This  is  the
    continuation of that hearing.

 4. The adjournment of these proceedings on 20 June 2014 was to  facilitate
    the proper presentation of all relevant issues from both parties.  With
    this in mind my error of law decision made clear some  of  the  matters
    that each party would be expected to cover. Paragraph 12 of my decision
    states:

        This appeal is adjourned to be remade by the Upper Tribunal. At the
        adjourned  hearing  the  Tribunal  will  expect  to  hear  evidence
        pertinent to the Article 8 claim and in doing so will take  account
        of the fact that the application under appeal was made well  before
        the change to the Immigration Rules in 2012. The Tribunal will hear
        submissions as  to  the  applicability  of  the  'new'  rules.  The
        Tribunal will expect to hear evidence about the Immigration  status
        of the Appellant's wife and children and about the history  of  the
        application. In particular the Tribunal will expect the  Respondent
        to confirm whether the chronology put  forward  by  Mr  Haywood  is
        accepted.

 5. In these circumstances it was a cause of concern at the outset  of  the
    resumed hearing to find that Ms Hastings, on behalf of the Secretary of
    State, was not able to confirm whether the chronology put forward by Mr
    Haywood was accepted and Mr Haywood  submitted  a  bundle  that  whilst
    containing up to date statements from the Appellant and his  wife  gave
    absolutely  no  information  about  the  immigration  status   of   the
    Appellant's wife and children. Mr Haywood also relied upon  the  bundle
    prepared for the error of law hearing and a written skeleton  argument.
    The skeleton argument makes no mention of the immigration status of the
    Appellant's wife and children. Ms Hastings  submitted  three  documents
    being a copy of an entry clearance application apparently made  by  the
    Appellant's wife, internet contact details  showing  the  international
    headquarters of the Appellant's wife's church and a UKBA sponsor search
    results list detailing family members sponsored to visit the UK by  the
    Appellant's brother-in-law.

 6. It was a further cause for concern  that  despite  having  received  an
    indication from the Respondent's representative recorded at paragraph 6
    of my error of law determination that the Secretary of State  may  have
    further evidence  to  adduce  there  had  been  no  follow  up  by  the
    Respondent's representative. This omission is even more striking  given
    that the Appellant's bundle shows that,  following  the  error  of  law
    hearing, a letter was sent to the Secretary of State by the Appellant's
    representative reminding the Secretary of State of her duty of candour.
    Ms Hastings was able to confirm that notes on the Respondent's file, in
    existence at the time of  the  error  of  law  hearing,  indicated  the
    existence of 'possible new evidence from HMRC regarding the Appellant's
    length of stay'.

 7. My concern about the Appellant's evidence could be resolved by  hearing
    the oral testimony of the Appellant and his wife who were both  present
    and I allowed Mr Haywood  time  to  take  further  instructions  before
    calling evidence. My concern about the Respondent's position could,  so
    far as the  chronology  is  concerned,  also  be  resolved  by  hearing
    evidence and making  findings  of  fact.  So  far  as  any  undisclosed
    evidence may affect the Appellant's position it would be speculative to
    make any judgement upon what that evidence may be. Suffice  it  to  say
    that if the Respondent does have evidence that would materially  affect
    the Appellant's  position  such  evidence  should  be  acted  upon  and
    disclosed to the Appellant's representatives.


Oral evidence

 8. The Appellant gave oral evidence and after confirming his identity  and
    address adopted his written statement of 26 August 2014. He added  that
    his son, Brendan, is asthmatic and  he  showed  Brendan's  inhaler  and
    medication.

 9. Cross-examined by Ms Hastings the Appellant said that he and  his  wife
    had a customary marriage by proxy in 2005. His wife was at the ceremony
    in Nigeria and  the  Appellant  was  represented  by  his  mother.  The
    Appellant had not met his wife  and  relied  on  family  knowledge  and
    pictures. Asked how it came about the Appellant said that it  was  like
    Biblical times. He was sent a picture and the marriage was arranged  by
    their families, in his case his mother.  Shown  a  copy  of  the  entry
    clearance application details dated 15 April 2005 the Appellant  agreed
    this was his wife but could not recall whether the marriage took  place
    before or after April 2005. He said that  a  customary  marriage  takes
    place over a period. He agreed with my suggestion that it was  fair  to
    assume that in April 2005 he was in the process of marrying.

10. The Appellant said that he spoke to his wife before marriage. He agreed
    before she came here that they both intended  to  live  in  the  United
    Kingdom. He could not remember whether he  told  her  that  he  had  no
    status in the United Kingdom but thought that he had told her  that  he
    had made an application to remain. The Appellant  was  aware  that  the
    application for a visitor's visa made in April  2005  was  refused  and
    said that she made  another  application.  Asked  if  his  wife  has  a
    passport the Appellant said that there was a passport but she  lost  it
    adding that they have moved a lot.  He  said  that  his  wife  made  an
    application to remain in the  United  Kingdom  in  2010  but  this  was
    refused.

11. The Appellant said his first language and that of  his  wife  was  Ibo.
    They communicate with each other English and  Ibo  but  their  children
    only speak English. The Appellant agreed that his wife is a  pastor  at
    Christ Restoration Bible Church  International  (CRBCI)  and  that  the
    headquarters of the Church is in Abuja. The position is unpaid. This is
    the only church with which she has ties.

12. The Appellant confirmed that  Dr  Chike  Nwamadu  is  his  wife's  full
    brother. Referred to the sponsor search results list the Appellant said
    he was not aware which relatives had been sponsored by his  brother-in-
    law. He said that his brother-in-law has visited the Appellant's family
    with his wife and children. His wife's father came to  visit  in  about
    2007 and some other relatives have visited.

13. The Appellant said that he did not know if his wife had  employment  in
    Nigeria. He thought she did some writing but did not know if  this  was
    for magazines or anything else. The Appellant said that he has a sister
    in Nigeria and a brother who is mentally ill. His mother died in  2011.
    He was in touch with his mother until she died and was  also  in  touch
    with his sister until his mother's death. He knew about  his  brother's
    mental health problems because his mother told. The Appellant said that
    he does not know where his sister lives in Nigeria as he has no  reason
    to know. His sister made enquiries to find  the  Appellant's  telephone
    number to tell him that their mother had died.

14. The Appellant said that his wife does not have an  income.  She  writes
    books. Asked why his wife says at paragraph 13 of  her  statement  that
    she supports him financially the Appellant said that they  walk  around
    the neighbourhood in the evening taking things that people  throw  away
    and then sell them. They have been doing this for about six months.

15. The Appellant said that his wife is  in  contact  with  her  father  in
    Nigeria but he does not know who else. He thought that her brother  had
    qualified as a doctor in the United Kingdom. His wife is not in contact
    with her church in  Nigeria  although  people  from  that  church  have
    visited. He did not know if the church in Nigeria  would  help  support
    his wife.

16. The Appellant agreed that his children  had  been  in  school  for  two
    years. Asked if there was any reason why he could not work  in  Nigeria
    the Appellant said that he was too old and his qualifications were  not
    compatible. He cannot get an entry job at the age of  53.  There  is  a
    different climate there and they want younger more aggressive people.

17. Answering questions from me the Appellant said that  his  children  see
    their cousins during the holidays, weekends and parties. They  live  in
    Milton Keynes having moved from Cumbria a little over a  year  ago.  He
    said that his wife's application to remain in the United Kingdom was on
    the basis of their marriage  and  children.  She  did  not  appeal  the
    refusal.

18. Chinyere Debbie Nwakanma gave evidence and answering questions from  Mr
    Haywood  confirmed  her  identity  and  adopted  her  written   witness
    statement. She said that her brother lives in the United  Kingdom  with
    his family. She has aged parents in Nigeria and a disabled sister.  Her
    husband has never visited her family in Nigeria and does not  have  any
    real idea about her family because he has not been home to see them.

19. Shown the entry  clearance  application  Mrs  Nwakanma  said  that  the
    details were correct. This was a visitor application  and  she  made  a
    subsequent visitor application which  was  granted.  She  has  made  no
    applications since because she  was  hoping  that  when  her  husband's
    position was rectified he could apply for her.

20. Cross examined by Ms Hastings the  witness  said  that  the  subsequent
    visitor application was made in her own name. She had  no  evidence  to
    confirm this because she has lost most of her documents through  moving
    and never expected that she would be asked.

21. The witness said that since she came to this country her parents and  a
    brother have visited. There has been no one else. Asked about the other
    relatives sponsored by her brother she said that she did  not  know  of
    them. Her brother is a very private person and she is not interested in
    other relatives. Ms Hastings suggested to the witness that she  has  an
    extensive family in Nigeria and the  witness  replied  "I'm  a  married
    woman". She said that her children had met her parents, they were  last
    here three years ago.

22. The witness confirmed that her church has its headquarters in Abuja and
    said that this is the way that it is run. The branch here does not know
    much about the branch in Nigeria. The pastor sometimes asks people from
    Nigeria to come to speak but the church here is run independently.  She
    said that the church in Nigeria would not assist her because she is not
    their pastor and they have enough pastors.  She  was  ordained  in  the
    United Kingdom. She added "if you ask for help back home nobody helps -
    this is the culture". The witness said that her brother qualified as  a
    doctor in Nigeria, their parents paid the fees.

23. Referred to  her  witness  statement  mentioning  her  sons  "childhood
    asthma" the witness said that she does not see it that way.  You  can't
    predict. A child can die at any time with asthma at  home  in  Nigeria.
    Taking him back would be like killing him. She is really  scared  about
    this. They would have no money to provide. They  have  exhausted  their
    resources.

24. The witness said that she has an income in this country from her  books
    and from gifts from her brother. They also trade by  way  of  car  boot
    sales. She supports her husband and  children  with  this  income.  Her
    income from books has mostly come since last December  and  amounts  to
    about �3,000. She thought that they made �100 to �150 or even �200  per
    week from trading. The witness said that she has a degree in biological
    education and she is a qualified teacher.

25. Answering questions from me the witness  said  she  has  no  income  in
    Nigeria and her only work in Nigeria was youth service. Her  successful
    visitor's visa application was made using a new  passport.  She  agreed
    that she made an application to stay in the UK and thought that it  was
    based on long residence. The application was denied  and  she  did  not
    appeal.


Submissions

26. On behalf the Respondent Ms Hastings relied on the refusal letter of  1
    November 2013 and the oral evidence. So far as the  chronology  forward
    by Mr Haywood is concerned it was not accepted.

27. Ms Hastings asked me to consider the credibility of the  Appellant  and
    his wife. They were highly evasive in terms of their  ties  to  Nigeria
    and their circumstances in the UK. Both have  remained  here  illegally
    and there is no evidence to show that either entered lawfully.  So  far
    as the long residence  application  was  concerned  there  was  a  huge
    evidential gap. The Appellant may have been  here  prior  to  2003  but
    there is no evidence to show that his residence was  continuous.  There
    is nothing to show that he was in the United Kingdom between  1996  and
    2003. The Appellant's ties to the United Kingdom are with  the  church.
    His  children  have  ties  to  their  school.  However   this   is   an
    international church with its headquarters in Abuja. It is not credible
    that the church would not assist. In addition it is  quite  clear  that
    the Appellant has family in Nigeria. Whereas he may not be  in  contact
    with them his wife  has  an  extensive  family  there.  Their  families
    arranged their marriage. The children have cousins here and  they  have
    grandparents and other relatives in Nigeria. There are plenty of family
    members in Nigeria.

28. Ms Hastings said that the family are likely to have access to money  in
    Nigeria. The Appellant's wife was educated to degree level. Her brother
    is a doctor. Her family must have money to be able to afford to educate
    their  children  in  this  way.  The  Appellant's  wife's  family  have
    travelled to visit the United Kingdom. The Appellant and his  wife  are
    resourceful people as shown by their ability to make money  trading  in
    this country.

29. Turning to the question of delay Ms  Hastings  accepted  that  this  is
    something to be taken into  account  in  the  proportionality  balance.
    There is no doubt that the Respondent has been guilty  of  a  delay  of
    about five years. However when the Home Office wrote to  the  Appellant
    in 2009 he was not at the address given. He had a duty to keep in touch
    with the Home Office.

30. Ms Hastings said that this was not an issue  of  family  life  but  one
    private life. The family would  stay  together.  The  Appellant  cannot
    succeed under the Immigration Rules  pertaining  at  the  time  of  his
    application and Appendix FM does not help. Ms  Hastings  accepted  that
    Article 8 is the only way the matter can be considered. In this respect
    section 55 of the Borders Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009  has  to
    be considered as does section 117 of the 2002 act. In this respect  the
    eldest child is  a  qualifying  child.  The  question  becomes  one  of
    reasonableness and in the Respondent's submission it is  reasonable  to
    expect the family to return to Nigeria.

31. For the Appellant Mr Haywood  relied  on  his  skeleton  argument.  The
    Respondent has simply looked at the situation in the country of  return
    whereas the proper approach is to look at the situation in  the  United
    Kingdom and then the position in the country of return. The test in the
    2014 amendment to the 2002 Act is one of reasonableness and not one  of
    insurmountable obstacles. It is  a  softer  test.  The  Respondent  has
    suggested that the Appellant and his wife are not credible but has  not
    particularised in  what  respects  they  should  be  found  not  to  be
    credible. The Appellant was upfront about family members.  He  has  not
    gone into detail but this is the nature  of  the  Appellant.  There  is
    nothing suspicious about his evidence.

32. The Appellant has been in United Kingdom continuously  since  2003.  He
    was also here in the 1980s and 1990s. He says that he has  never  left.
    There is evidence that he has worked, that he paid council tax and that
    he has paid other bills. He has not gone  to  ground.  The  application
    under appeal was made of his own volition in  2004.  Between  2004  and
    2008 there was no action taken by the Respondent and contact  from  the
    Appellant  was  discouraged.  There  is  a  hiatus  in  2009  when  the
    Respondent made a decision, the Appellant says that he did not  receive
    the decision. It is however clear that his employers  were  in  contact
    with the  Home  Office  at  the  time.  Detailed  representations  were
    submitted about his marriage and children, no  enforcement  action  was
    taken and responding to the representations  was  not  prioritised.  EB
    (Kosovo) [2008] UKHL 41 was  raised  as  early  as  October  2010.  The
    representations were repeatedly chased  including  by  way  of  an  MPs
    letter but there was  no  significant  prioritisation.  The  delay  was
    significant. This was a long residence application which took 10  years
    to determine. The only delay  which  was  down  to  the  Appellant  was
    between January and May 2009. Referring to EB (Kosovo) the  gravity  of
    delay is accentuated because of the children. The delay is inconsistent
    with the public interest in immigration control. This was not firm fast
    or fair decision-making.

33. I reserved my decision.


Decision

34. The background to this appeal has been recited previously but there has
    been significant clarification. The  Appellant  applied  for  leave  to
    remain on the basis of long residence. His application was  made  on  7
    February 2004 and refused on 1 November 2013  almost  10  years  later.
    During this period the Appellant arranged a marriage through his family
    in Nigeria, married, met his wife (in 2005) and had  two  children  (in
    2007 and 2009).

35. The  basis  of  the  Appellant's  application  was  that  he  had  been
    continuously resident in  the  United  Kingdom  since  1986.  That  was
    rejected by the First-tier Tribunal  and  the  finding  made  that  his
    continuous residence dated from 2003. The  long  residence  appeal  was
    dismissed under the Immigration Rules on that basis and  that  decision
    stands. Mr Haywood in his submissions suggested that the Appellant  had
    spent time in United Kingdom in the 1980s and 1990s  and  that  is  not
    inconsistent with the findings of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (paragraph
    50). I am satisfied that the Appellant has been  continuously  resident
    in United Kingdom since 2003.

36. The factual clarification relates  to  the  Appellant's  wife  and  his
    relationship with her.  It  is  significant  in  two  particular  ways.
    Firstly because  it  discloses  her  immigration  status  and  secondly
    because it speaks to the ties  of  the  Appellant  and  his  wife  with
    Nigeria. So  far  as  the  Appellant's  wife's  immigration  status  is
    concerned it is clear that she has none. She applied  to  come  to  the
    United Kingdom as a visitor and her application  was  rejected.  It  is
    clear that this was  a  dishonest  application  because  the  Appellant
    accepts that the intention was that his wife to come United Kingdom  to
    live not to visit. The Appellant's wife says that she  made  a  further
    successful application to come as a visitor and that she  arrived  here
    on that basis. There is no evidence to corroborate this. In  any  event
    taking matters in the most favourable light for the Appellant's wife it
    was a fraudulent application because she had no intention of  visiting,
    her intention was to stay. She has remained without leave  ever  since.
    She says that she has lost her passport. She also says that she made an
    application to remain which was denied. There is no  evidence  of  this
    but in all likelihood it was an application to be joined as a dependent
    to a husband's outstanding application.

37. Turning to the ties of the Appellant and  his  wife  with  Nigeria  his
    evidence is that this was an arranged marriage negotiated on his behalf
    in Nigeria by his family. This can only be demonstrative of strong  and
    continuing ties to his home country. It  is  also  demonstrative  of  a
    relationship between the Appellant's  family  and  his  wife's  family.
    Indeed the Appellant's wife says in her statement "We got connected  in
    2003 through a mutual family member". If the Appellant did  not  retain
    strong ties to Nigeria he would not have sought to arrange  a  marriage
    in Nigeria and bring the wife, whom he had never met, from Nigeria.

38. I have already made comment above about failure  of  the  Appellant  to
    address the immigration status of his wife and children despite  having
    been exhorted to do so at the error of law hearing. The significance of
    this is perhaps emphasised by the  fact  that  this  failure  was  also
    highlighted in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (see  paragraph
    51). It is from this starting point that I view Ms Hastings allegations
    of  evasiveness.  The  failure  to  address  the  immigration   status,
    including method of entry, of the  Appellant's  wife  was  evasive.  Mr
    Haywood did not deal with this issue in examination  in  chief  of  the
    Appellant.  No  detailed  evidence  in  this  respect  was  sought   in
    examination in chief of the Appellant's wife. A large amount  was  left
    to cross-examination and I can only agree that the answers  given  bore
    the hallmarks of  evasiveness.  So  far  as  the  Appellant's  wife  is
    concerned I am satisfied that she entered this  country  unlawfully  by
    falsely claiming to be a visitor, that she knew that she  was  entering
    this country unlawfully, that she remained here unlawfully and that the
    Appellant was not only fully complicit  in  her  actions  but  that  he
    encouraged and indeed instigated her actions.

39. So  far  as  the  Appellant's  status  is  concerned  the  unchallenged
    conclusion of the First-tier Tribunal that he did  not  meet  the  long
    residence rules means not only that the  Appellant  was  a  person  who
    unlawfully stayed in this country but also that he made his application
    to remain on a false premise.

40. Returning to the issue of evasiveness the evidence given  by  both  the
    Appellant and his wife in respect of their ties  to  Nigeria  was  also
    evasive. I do not accept Mr Haywood's contention that this, so  far  as
    the Appellant is concerned, is  simply  down  to  his  nature.  I  have
    already found above that the Appellant retained strong ties to  Nigeria
    evidenced  by  the  circumstances  of  his  marriage.  The  Appellant's
    evidence of his own family ties was  not  only  vague  and  lacking  in
    detail but also inconsistent. On the one hand he said that he  had  not
    spoken to his sister for 10 years (see paragraph 52 first-tier Tribunal
    determination) on the other hand he said at his sister  called  him  to
    inform him of his mother's  death  in  2011.  I  find  the  Appellant's
    evidence that his sister had to make enquiries to  find  his  telephone
    number incredible and equally I do not believe that the Appellant  does
    not know where in Nigeria his sister lives.  The  Appellant's  evidence
    about his brother's mental health problems was  equally  vague  and  no
    detail was given about the nature or extent of these problems or  about
    his brother's whereabouts. I do  not  accept  that  the  Appellant  was
    giving an open and complete account.

41. The evidence of the Appellant's wife was equally evasive  in  terms  of
    her ties to Nigeria. No substantial information was disclosed about her
    contact with her family in Nigeria and, her response when pressed "I am
    a married woman" demonstrated her evasiveness. I find substance  in  Ms
    Hastings' submission that a family, educating at least two children  to
    degree level and beyond, is likely to have significant  resources.  The
    Appellant's wife is a 42 year old woman who came to the United  Kingdom
    at the age of around 34. I do not accept that the Appellant's wife does
    not retain significant ties to Nigeria. Her  evidence  that  she  is  a
    qualified teacher yet only to have undertaken youth  service  prior  to
    leaving Nigeria at the age of 34  is  also  indicative  of  an  evasive
    approach to evidence with no  indication  given  of  how  she  occupied
    herself prior to leaving Nigeria.

42. Finally I found the Appellant's wife's responses to the questions asked
    about the church in Nigeria to be expedient. The Appellant's wife is  a
    pastor at CRBCI in London. The church website clearly shows  that  this
    is the UK branch of a church having its international  headquarters  in
    Abuja with two other branches in the city. The various branches share a
    common e-mail provider 'crbci.org'. I do not accept that the UK  branch
    has little or nothing to do with the headquarters. I do not accept that
    the Appellant's wife could expect to receive  no  assistance  from  her
    church were she to return to Nigeria or for that matter  that  Nigerian
    culture or Pentecostal Christian culture denies help to those in need.

43. The Appellant's wife has a growing income as an author from the sale of
    books. She is a qualified teacher. The Appellant and his wife have been
    making money through trading in unwanted goods. There is  every  reason
    to believe that they will be able to  support  themselves  in  Nigeria.
    Writing and selling books is not an employment that is  dependent  upon
    home location and the money that the Appellant's wife  currently  makes
    in this respect would continue  to  be  made  were  she  to  return  to
    Nigeria. As a teacher qualified in  Nigeria  no  reason  has  been  put
    forward why she would not be able to obtain employment in Nigeria.  The
    couple's resourcefulness  in  making  money  from  trading  could  also
    produce an income in Nigeria. Taking this into account together with my
    finding that both have family in Nigeria and that the  church  is  also
    likely to support if support were needed it is my judgement  that  this
    family would in all probability be self sufficient in Nigeria.

44. Having examined the facts I now turn to  the  question  of  delay.  The
    Appellant's application was submitted in 2004 and  the  decision  under
    appeal was made in 2013. The Respondent accepts that nothing  was  done
    between 2004 and 2009 and indeed the  Appellant  cannot  be  blamed  in
    anyway for not chasing progress during this period because  the  letter
    from the Respondent acknowledging the application expressly discouraged
    contact.  Although  a  letter  was  sent  by  the  Respondent  to   the
    Appellant's last known address in 2009 and  thereafter  the  Respondent
    purported to refuse the  application  it  is  clear  firstly  that  the
    Appellant resumed contact in 2009, secondly that  he  has  remained  in
    contact ever since, thirdly that the purported refusal in 2009 was  not
    the Respondent's final and appealable decision and lastly that  it  was
    not until the end of 2013  that  a  final  decision  was  made  on  the
    Appellant's 2004 application. In short  I  accept  the  chronology  put
    forward by Mr Haywood. There  is  no  doubt  that  the  Respondent  was
    responsible for a substantial and inexcusable delay.

45. It was agreed by both representatives  that  the  matter  under  appeal
    engaged and indeed could only considered by reference to Article  8  of
    the Human Rights Convention. In considering the Appellant's  appeal  in
    this respect it is self-evident that the first four of the  five  stage
    Razgar v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27 criteria are  met.  The  Appellant  having
    been present in the United Kingdom since 2003 and having commenced  his
    married life and started a family in this  country  has  established  a
    private life here as have his wife and children.  The  interference  to
    that private life meaning that the family would have to uproot and move
    to Nigeria is of sufficient gravity to engage the operation of  Article
    8. Nobody within the family has  the  right  to  be  here  and  so  the
    interference is in accordance with the law and necessary in the  public
    interest for the legitimate aim of immigration control.  The  issue  is
    therefore one of proportionality.

46. Mr Haywood invites me to take  a  holistic  approach  when  considering
    proportionality and that really is the only way to properly  deal  with
    the complex issues arising. In weighing matters in the balance  I  look
    at the public interest on the one side and  the  private  life  of  the
    Appellant and his family on the other. So far as the public interest is
    concerned I have regard to the matters specified in section 117 of  the
    Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

47. Dealing first with the statutory public interest considerations I  take
    as a positive factor the fact that the  Appellant  and  his  wife  both
    speak English. I cannot take financial independence in their favour  as
    the evidence presented to the First-tier Tribunal  showed  them  to  be
    reliant on the support of the London Borough of Newham and there is  no
    evidence before me of financial independence. I also  take  account  of
    the fact that the Appellant has been present in the United Kingdom  for
    a significant period of time and has built up social  connections  with
    friends and with his wife's family in  this  country.  The  Appellant's
    witness statement does not detail and further  qualitative  aspects  of
    private life to take into account. I also take account  of  his  wife's
    private life because a holistic approach requires me  to  consider  the
    position of all family members.  The  Appellant's  wife  has  built  up
    substantial connections with her church where she is an ordained pastor
    and with the church community for whom she provides  pastoral  care.  I
    also take into account the private lives of the  Appellant's  children,
    both born in the United Kingdom and who have never travelled out of the
    United Kingdom. Both have built childhood friendships in  this  country
    and both have positive family contacts with their cousins here. I  also
    take account of  the  fact  the  younger  child  is  showing  signs  of
    excellence at school and also that he suffers from asthma and that  his
    mother worries about the effect that  the  climate  and  conditions  in
    Nigeria will have upon his condition.

48. Section 117(4) Nationality Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  requires
    little weight to be given to a private life  established  by  a  person
    when present in the United Kingdom unlawfully. The Appellant  has  been
    in United Kingdom unlawfully throughout the  period  when  his  private
    life here has been  established.  His  wife  has  never  been  lawfully
    present. Section 117(5) requires little weight to be given to a private
    life established by a person at a time when  the  person's  immigration
    status is precarious. The Appellant and his wife  having  been  present
    unlawfully throughout have, in my  judgement,  always  held  precarious
    immigration status. I will deal with Section 117(6) below.

49. There are in my judgement substantial negative issues to be weighed  in
    the proportionality balance. I have analysed these  above.  In  summary
    the Appellant and his wife have made cynical and calculated attempts to
    circumvent immigration control. The Appellant had no lawful  status  at
    the time he made  his  application  to  remain  and  indeed  based  his
    application on  a  long-term  lack  of  lawful  status.  The  Appellant
    conspired with his wife to bring her to  this  country  unlawfully  and
    having done so she remained without lawful status.  The  Appellant  and
    his wife commenced their family life together and extended their family
    through the birth of their two children in the full knowledge of  their
    unlawful presence in United  Kingdom.  Whereas  the  Appellant  had  an
    outstanding application it was not only one based upon a lack of lawful
    status it was also one founded on falsity.

50. I have also examined above the family ties of  the  Appellant  and  his
    wife in Nigeria and their likely ability to sustain themselves in  that
    country. These are factors that militate in favour of their  return.  I
    am satisfied that with the Appellant returning to Nigeria with his wife
    and children there will be no interference in their family life.  There
    is no reason why  the  children  cannot  continue  their  education  in
    Nigeria. English is  an  official  language  of  the  country  and  the
    children have been  exposed  to  their  parents  speaking  in  the  Ibo
    language. The children will have their grandparents  and  other  family
    members in Nigeria. There is no corroborative evidence to suggest  that
    the younger child's asthma will be adversely affected by  the  Nigerian
    climate or that treatment of this common condition is not available  in
    Nigeria.

51. There has been substantial delay on behalf of the Respondent in dealing
    with the Appellant's application and I have carefully  considered  such
    delay in the light of EB (Kosovo) [2008] UKHL 41. There can be no doubt
    that  the  weight  accorded  to  the  requirements  of  firm  and  fair
    immigration control is diminished and little doubt that the Appellant's
    ties with the United Kingdom have strengthened and that as time went on
    he will have felt more secure and his expectation that the  authorities
    would accede to his request  to  remain  will  have  grown.  These  are
    weighty matters which individually and cumulatively lessen the negative
    weight  in  the  proportionality  balance.  However  it  must  also  be
    significant that the Appellant's claim to remain was  built  upon  sand
    and his hope that he would be allowed to stay was always based  upon  a
    hope that the authorities would accept a situation that  he  could  not
    prove.

52. Taking all the above into account  in  my  judgement  and  despite  the
    inexcusable delay in decision-making on the part of the  Respondent  it
    is my judgement that the proportionality  balance  falls  very  heavily
    against the Appellant. It  is  a  balance  where  the  public  interest
    considerations outweigh the private life established by the  Appellant.
    It is at this point that the consideration of  section  117B(6)  enters
    the equation. Despite the public interest in  removal  outweighing  the
    Appellant's right to a  private  life  the  public  interest  does  not
    require his removal where he has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with a qualifying child and it would not be reasonable  to
    expect the child to leave the United Kingdom.  The  Appellant's  eldest
    child is a qualifying child because he has lived in United Kingdom  for
    a continuous period of seven years or more. The question is whether  it
    is reasonable to expect the child to leave the United Kingdom.

53. In deciding whether it is reasonable I take into  account  firstly  the
    fact that the Appellant's eldest child  was  born  and  brought  up  in
    United Kingdom, secondly that he is in school and thirdly  that  he  is
    progressing well. I take into  account  the  letter  from  his  school.
    Having done so I find it reasonable that  he  should  return  with  his
    family to Nigeria. This is a Nigerian family in which  he  parents  not
    only speak English, one of the official languages of Nigeria  but  also
    Ibo a language widely spoken in Nigeria. I have found  that  they  have
    substantial ties to Nigeria. I have found that it is  proportionate  to
    require them to return. There is no reason why the family  should  have
    any difficulty integrating into Nigerian society. There  is  no  reason
    why both children  should  not  continue  their  education  there.  The
    youngest child suffers from asthma but there is not medical evidence to
    suggest that this cannot be treated in Nigeria.  There  is  nothing  to
    suggest that Brian, or indeed any  family  member,  will  be  adversely
    affected by relocating to their country of nationality. It is  entirely
    reasonable to expect the eldest child to leave the United  Kingdom  and
    for the family unit to re-establish itself there

 Summary

54. The decision in respect of Article 8 ECHR of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    involved the making of a material error of law and has been set aside.

55. I remake the decision by dismissing the Appellant's appeal.
