Representation
For the appellants: Mr K Idowu, Solicitor, Kola Fitzpatrick & Co
For the respondent: Mr G Saunders, Home Office Presenting Officer

(i) To qualify as  a  "jobseeker"  under  reg  6(1)(a)  of  the  Immigration
(European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (SI  2006/1003)  an  EEA  national
must meet all three requirements set out at reg 6(4), including that  he  be
a person who entered the United Kingdom  in order to seek employment.

(ii) A person who is a jobseeker can also qualify as a  "worker"  under  reg
6(1)(b) but the requirements applied by ECJ case law in respect of  workers-
as-jobseekers are essentially the same as those set out in reg 6(1)(a).

(iii) In considering what period of time a jobseeker has  to  find  work,  6
months may be a general rule of thumb, but there is  no  fixed  time  limit.
The ECJ in Antonissen [1991] ECR  I-745,  Case  C-344/95  decided  that  the
period must  be  a  "reasonable  period"  and  the  assessment  of  what  is
"reasonable" must be made in the context of each individual  case.  Thus  it
may sometimes be less,  sometimes  more,  than  6  months.   In  all  cases,
however, the period in question must start from the  date  of  the  person's
arrival in the United Kingdom.

(iv) To satisfy the self-sufficiency requirement  of  the  EEA  Regulations,
under reg 4(4) the resources of a family member cannot  be  aggregated  with
those of the EEA national  where  those  resources  are  derived  from  past
employment of that family member: W(China)  and  X(China)  [2006]  EWCA  Civ
1494, GM and AM [2006] UKAIT 00059 and MA  and  others  [2006]  UKAIT  00090
applied.

 (v) The burden of proof is on the applicant/appellant to establish any EEA
right of admission or residence. A failure to substantiate any such right  -
for example by failing to produce relevant evidence  -  is  likely  to  mean
that the claim/appeal will fail.



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The first appellant is a citizen of Germany born  on  18  December  1963.
The second and third appellants are his wife, born on 19 September 1970  and
child born on 13 May 1988. They are citizens of  Sierra  Leone  and  Nigeria
respectively. This is a reconsideration of the determination of  Immigration
Judge Saffer notified on 6  March  2007  dismissing  their  appeals  against
decisions dated 22 January 2007 refusing to issue the first  appellant  with
a registration certificate and  refusing  to  issue  the  second  and  third
appellants  with  a  residence  card  as  confirmation  of  their  right  of
residence in the United Kingdom under European Community  law.  The  outcome
of the second and third  appellants'  applications  for  reconsideration  is
dependent on the first appellant's application.

2. The immigration judge's findings of fact were as follows:

    "10. I do not accept that the first appellant is a worker as defined as
    he has never worked here. Just because he has  sought  employment  does
    not mean he is a worker. He has not fallen unemployed as he  has  never
    been employed.


    11. Even if I am wrong in that  he  has  relied  on  social  assistance
    following the death of his father as he paid the subsidised  pensioners
    rent to which he was not entitled for 4 months which saved  him  almost
    �2000 being almost the total amount of the combination of  his  savings
    and his wife's income. Without that  reliance  on  subsidised  rent  to
    which he was not entitled they would have no savings at all. He is  not
    therefore self-sufficient."

3. The grounds  for  reconsideration  contend  that  the  immigration  judge
materially erred in law at para 10 in that his interpretation  of  the  term
"worker" wrongly excluded someone who  (like  the  first  appellant)  was  a
jobseeker. The grounds also argue that the immigration judge  was  wrong  to
find at para 11 that the first appellant had  relied  on  social  assistance
and wrong to conclude that the appellant's savings taken together  with  his
wife's earnings did not make him self-sufficient.

The relevant facts

4. Not for the first time in an EEA appeal  the  evidence  produced  by  the
appellants  as  to  their  circumstances  was  relatively  scant,  but   the
following seems uncontentious. The first and  second  appellant  married  in
Nigeria on 2 May 2000. The first appellant had lived in Germany as  a  self-
employed person. He gave no information about his previous visits to the  UK
and left blank the section in the EEA1 application form  (para  1.7)  asking
for the date on which he last entered the UK.  The same form  at  para  2.1.
stated that the date on which his wife, the second appellant,  last  entered
the UK was 7 June 2006 and the date on which his son, the  third  appellant,
last entered was 2 March 2006. Mr Idowu  said  that  the  first  appellant's
case has always been that he last entered the UK  in  "July  2006";  he  was
unable to help with any specific date in that month.

5. Whatever the precise date on which the first appellant last  entered  the
UK, it is known that he applied for a registration certificate  for  himself
and a residence card for his wife and child on 7 August 2006. Enclosed  with
their application was a marriage certificate, a birth certificate, a  German
ID card, a valid Sierra Leone passport in respect of  the  second  appellant
and a valid Nigerian passport in respect of  the  third  appellant.   On  17
August 2006 the Home Office wrote to the  first  appellant  saying  that  to
enable the application to be considered he should forward within 21 days:

    "Evidence that he was exercising Treaty rights in the United Kingdom in
    one of the following ways; i.e. recent wage slip and employer's letter;


    Recent bank statement, utility bill, council tax  bill,  school  letter
    for [...]".

6. The first appellant made no reply to this request and on 20 January  2007
the Home Office  issued  decisions  refusing  all  three  applications.  The
reason stated in the notices of refusal was that  the  first  appellant  had
failed to provide evidence that he was a qualified person as set out in  reg
6 of the 2006 Regulations.

7. By the time of the hearing of their appeal  the  appellants  had  adduced
further evidence. Contrary to  Tribunal  directions  no  witness  statements
were  submitted,  but  the  first  appellant  gave  oral  evidence.  In  his
determination  Immigration  Judge  Saffer  recorded  the  first  appellant's
evidence as follows:

    "8.The first appellant  gave  no  details  of  any  employment  in  his
    application. He produced bank statements for November 2006  to  January
    2007 showing a  balance  at  the  date  of  decision  of  about  �2000,
    correspondence outlining his attempts to obtain work  as  a  driver  of
    public transport, and his wife's pay slips.


    9. In evidence he said that he began looking for work in October  2006.
    The money in his account comes from his wife's  earnings  of  �225  per
    week and his savings which came from his business in Germany  which  is
    no longer subsisting. After they came here they lived in  his  father's
    council flat even after he died in August and  paid  the  �9  per  week
    subsidised pensioners rent until they had to move out in January.  They
    now pay rent of �500 per month."

8. Besides the bank statements and the second  appellant's  wage  slips  the
appellants  produced  5  documents  in  time  for  the  hearing  before  the
immigration judge. One was a printed form from Jobseekers Plus  headed  "DPA
2: Storing your personal information". It  did  not  anywhere  identify  the
first appellant and bore no date. It began with  the  words:  "You  recently
provided verbal consent to allow  Jobcentre  Plus  to  store  your  personal
information on our computer systems. This form  provides  you  with  further
details about how your information is  processed  and  used".  The  other  4
items were letters addressed to the first appellant. Two of these were  from
Arriva London  bus  company  dated  September  2006  and  21  November  2006
respectively.  The  September  letter  thanked  him  for   contacting   them
regarding  employment  as  a  full  time  bus  driver,  set  out  the  basic
requirements he must have to be considered  for  the  post  of  trainee  bus
driver and enclosed an application form together with an  information  pack.
The 21 November letter thanked him for his application and  stated  that  he
had been successfully short-listed but that the company did not require  new
drivers at the moment and was putting recruitment for new drivers  on  hold.
It said that it hoped to contact him within the next  few  months.  The  two
letters from London Central bus company were dated 19 September 2006 and  29
December 2006 respectively. The September letter thanked him  for  returning
his completed form in  support  of  his  application  for  employment  as  a
trainee bus driver Stockwell 06, but said it regretted that the company  was
unable to offer him employment. The December  letter  thanked  him  for  his
completed form  and  went  on  to  say  that  under  the  company's  current
recruitment policy (which included holding a valid full UK  driving  license
for a minimum period of 2 years (12 months if the  person  has  exchanged  a
foreign license for a UK license)), he did not appear to meet their  minimum
criteria. It went on to say that if he still wished  to  be  considered  for
the position once he had the minimum  experience,  he  should  contact  them
again.

9. Mr Idowu said that he was instructed  that  at  the  hearing  before  the
immigration  judge  the  appellant  had  indeed  shown  more  correspondence
relating to job inquiries but had not retained these. We  pointed  out  that
the immigration judge made no mention of any other items of  correspondence,
the file contained nothing else and the appellant's representatives had  not
adduced any other items of correspondence or a statement from the  appellant
in support of this claim to have submitted more. Nor,  as  we  have  already
noted,  had  the  appellants  produced  any  witness  statements.  In   such
circumstances we were not prepared  to  accept  that  there  was  any  other
evidence of job inquiries submitted beyond the four aforementioned letters.

The relevant law

10.  Regulation  4  (1)  of  the  Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1003) (hereafter the "2006  Regulations"  or  "the
Regulations") state that in these Regulations:

    "(a)"worker" means a worker within the meaning of  Article  39  of  the
    Treaty establishing the European Community;
    ...
    (c) "self-sufficient person" means a person who has-
     (i) sufficient  resources  not  to  become  a  burden  on  the  social
    assistance system of the United Kingdom during his period of residence;
    and
    (ii)comprehensive sickness insurance cover in the United Kingdom;"


11. Regulation 4(2) states that:

    "(2) For the purposes of paragraph 1(c), where family  members  of  the
    person concerned reside in the United Kingdom and their right to reside
    is dependent upon their being family members of that person -
         (a) the requirement for that person to  have  sufficient  resources
         not to become a burden on  the  social  assistance  system  of  the
         United Kingdom  during  his  period  of  residence  shall  only  be
         satisfied if his resources and those  of  the  family  members  are
         sufficient to avoid him and his  family  members  becoming  such  a
         burden;
         (b) the requirement for that person to have comprehensive  sickness
         insurance cover in the United Kingdom shall only be satisfied if he
         and his family members have such cover."


12. Regulation 4(4) states:

    "For the purposes of paragraphs 1(c) and (d) and paragraphs (2) and (3)
    [which concerns a student's resources], the  resources  of  the  person
    concerned and, where applicable, any family members, are to be regarded
    as sufficient if they exceed the maximum level  of  resources  which  a
    United Kingdom national and his family members may possess if he is  to
    become eligible for social assistance under the United Kingdom  benefit
    system."

13. Regulation 6 (1) states that:

   " ..."qualified person" means a person who is an EEA national and in  the
   United Kingdom as-
     a) a jobseeker;
     b) a worker;
     c) a self-employed person;
     d) a self-sufficient person; or
     e) a student."


14. Regulation 6(4) states that:

    "For the purposes of paragraph 1(a), a "jobseeker" means a  person  who
    enters the United Kingdom in order to seek employment and  can  provide
    evidence that he is seeking employment and  has  a  genuine  chance  of
    being engaged".


15. Regulation 13, headed "Initial right of residence" provides that:

    "(1) An EEA national is entitled to reside in the United Kingdom for  a
    period not exceeding three months beginning on the date on which he  is
    admitted to the United Kingdom provided that he holds a valid  national
    identity card or passport issued by an EEA State.
    (2) A family member of an EEA national residing in the  United  Kingdom
    under paragraph (1) who is not himself an EEA national is  entitled  to
    reside in the United Kingdom provided that he holds a valid passport.
    (3) But-
    (a) this regulation is subject to regulation 19(3)(b); and
    (b) an EEA national or his family member who  becomes  an  unreasonable
    burden on the social assistance system  of  the  United  Kingdom  shall
    cease to have the right to reside under this regulation."


16.  Also  relevant  are  certain  provisions  of  the  (parent)   Citizens'
Directive (Directive 2004/38/EC).  Recitals  9  and  10  of  this  Directive
state:


    "(9) Union citizens should have the right  of  residence  in  the  host
    Member State for a period, not exceeding  three  months  without  being
    subject to any conditions or any formalities other than the requirement
    to hold a valid identity card or passport, without prejudice to a  more
    favourable treatment applicable to job-seekers  as  recognised  by  the
    case-law of the Court of Justice.


    (10) Persons exercising their right of residence should  not,  however,
    become an unreasonable burden on the social assistance  system  of  the
    host Member State during an initial period of residence. Therefore, the
    right of residence for Union citizens  and  their  family  members  for
    periods in excess of three months should be subject to conditions."


17. Also pertinent are recitals 20 and 21:

    "(20) In accordance with the prohibition of discrimination  on  grounds
    of nationality, all Union citizens  and  their  family  residing  in  a
    Member State on the basis of  this  Directive  should  enjoy,  in  that
    Member State, equal treatment with nationals in areas  covered  by  the
    Treaty, subject to such specific provisions as are  expressly  provided
    for in the Treaty and secondary law.


    (21) However, it should be left to the  host  Member  State  to  decide
    whether it will grant social assistance during the first  three  months
    of residence, or for a longer period in  the  case  of  jobseekers,  to
    Union citizens other  than  those  who  are  workers  or  self-employed
    persons  or  who  retain  that  status  or  their  family  members,  or
    maintenance assistance  for  studies,  including  vocational  training,
    prior to acquisition of the right of permanent residence, to these same
    persons."

18. Article 3 (headed "Beneficiaries"), which deals with family members  and
other family members, states in its final sentence:

    "The host Member State shall undertake an extensive examination of  the
    personal circumstances  and  shall  justify  any  denial  of  entry  or
    residence to these people."


19. Article 2(3) gives the following definition of "host Member State":

    "'host Member State' means the Member State to which  a  Union  citizen
    moves  in  order  to  exercise  his/her  right  of  free  movement  and
    residence.

20. Article 6 (headed "Right of residence for up to three months") states:

    1. "Union citizens shall have the right of residence on  the  territory
       of another Member State for a period of up to three  months  without
       any conditions or any formalities other  than  the  requirements  to
       hold a valid identity card or passport.
    2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to family members  in
       possession of a valid passport who are not  nationals  of  a  Member
       State, accompanying or joining the Union citizen."

21. Article 7 (headed "Right of residence for more than three months")

    "1. All Union citizens  shall  have  the  right  of  residence  on  the
    territory of another Member State for a period  of  longer  than  three
    months if they:
             (a) are workers or self-employed persons in  the  host  Member
             State;
             (b)have sufficient resources for themselves and  their  family
             members not to become a burden on the social assistance system
             of the host Member State during their period of residence  and
             have comprehensive sickness insurance cover in the host member
             State; or
                  (c)... [this subparagraph covers students]
             (d) are family members accompanying or joining a Union citizen
             who satisfies the conditions referred to in points (a),(b)  or
             (c).


    2. The right of residence provided for in paragraph 1 shall  extend  to
    family members who are not nationals of a Member State, accompanying or
    joining the Union citizen in the host Member State provided  that  such
    Union citizen satisfies the conditions referred to in  paragraph  1(a),
    (b) or (c)."


22. Article  8  (headed  "Administrative  formalities  for  Union  citizens)
stipulates that  the  host  Member  State  may  require  Union  citizens  to
register with the relevant  authorities.  Subparagraph  2  states  that  the
"deadline for registration may not be less than three months from  the  date
of arrival..." Subparagraph 3 states that:


    "For the registration certificate to be issued, Member States may  only
    require that
    -Union citizens on whom  point  (a)  of  Article  7(1)  applies  [which
    concerns workers or self-employed persons]  present  a  valid  identity
    card or passport, a confirmation of engagement from the employer  or  a
    certificate  of  employment,  or  proof  that  they  are  self-employed
    persons'
    -Union citizens to whom  point  (b)  of  Article  7(1)  applies  [which
    concerns self-sufficient persons] present  a  valid  identity  card  or
    passport and provide proof that they satisfy the conditions  laid  down
    therein;
    -..."


23. Subparagraph 5 states that:


    "Member States may not lay down a fixed amount  which  they  regard  as
    'sufficient resources', but they must take into  account  the  personal
    situation of the person concerned. In all cases this amount  shall  not
    be higher than the threshold below which nationals of the  host  Member
    State become eligible for social assistance, or, where  this  criterion
    is not applicable, higher than the minimum social security pension paid
    by the host Member State."


24. Also of some importance to this  case  are  certain  provisions  of  the
Directive dealing with proof and verification. Recital 14 states:

    "The supporting documents required by the competent authorities for the
    issuing of a registration certificate or of a residence card should  be
    comprehensively specified in order to  avoid  divergent  administrative
    practices or interpretations constituting  an  undue  obstacle  to  the
    exercise of the right of residence by Union citizens and  their  family
    members."


25. Article 14 (headed "Retention of the right of residence") states:

    "1. Union citizens and their family members shall  have  the  right  of
    residence provided for in Article 6, as long as they do not  become  an
    unreasonable burden on the social assistance system of the host  Member
    State.


    2. Union citizens and their family members  shall  have  the  right  of
    residence provided for in Articles 7, 12 and 13 as long  as  they  meet
    the conditions set out therein.


     In specific cases where there is a reasonable doubt as  to  whether  a
    Union citizen or his/here family members satisfies the  conditions  set
    out in Articles, 7,12 and 13,  Member  States  shall  verify  if  these
    conditions are fulfilled. This verification  may  not  be  carried  out
    systematically.


    ...."



26. Article 23 (headed "Related rights") states:


      "Irrespective of nationality, the family members of  a  Union  citizen
      who have the right of residence or the right of permanent residence in
      a Member State shall be  entitled  to  take  up  employment  or  self-
      employment there."

Our assessment


27. Both parties accepted, and we have no hesitation in  finding,  that  the
immigration judge erred in law. His assertion at para 10 that:

    "10. I do not accept that the first appellant is a worker as defined as
    he has never worked here. Just because he has  sought  employment  does
    not mean he is a worker. He has not fallen unemployed as he  has  never
    been employed"

harbours a double error. Contrary to what this paragraph says, it is  not  a
requirement of European Community law that to qualify as a "worker" one  has
to be a person who  has  worked  in  the  host  Member  State.  The  concept
includes persons who are (genuine) jobseekers: see Case C-292/89  Antonissen
[1991] ECR I-745, Case C-344/95, Commission v  Belgium  [1997]  ECR  I-1035,
Case C-138/02 Collins  [2004]  All  ER  (D)  424  (Mar).  Secondly,  despite
acknowledging in para 3 that the relevant  law  was  set  out  in  the  2006
Regulations, the immigration judge failed to appreciate that by  reg  6  the
first appellant was entitled to be treated as a qualified person so long  as
he fell within one of 5 sub-categories, including that of "(a) jobseeker".

28. We also consider that the immigration judge erred in law when  assessing
whether the first appellant was a "self-sufficient person" in  finding  that
the first appellant had relied on social assistance following the  death  of
his father simply by virtue of having paid the  rent  due  on  his  father's
council house at the subsidised rate of �9 a week for 4 months until he  and
his wife had to move out in January  2007.  The  immigration  judge  had  no
discernible evidential basis for assuming that the first appellant had  ever
sought or obtained a rent subsidy "to which  he  was  not  entitled"  rather
than simply being entitled by the terms  of  the  tenancy  as  his  father's
successor to continue paying the same rent for a certain period. For him  to
find that the first appellant had relied  on  social  assistance  by  paying
this rate was pure speculation.

29.  It  remains,  however,  to  determine  whether  the  immigration  judge
materially erred in law. In particular, we need to ask  whether  his  errors
materially affected the outcome of the appeals.

30. Mr Idowu submitted that the immigration judge should  have  allowed  the
appeals on two separate  bases:  because  (1)  the  first  appellant  was  a
jobseeker and (2) he was a self-sufficient person.

The first appellant's position as a jobseeker

31. It was Mr Idowu's first line of argument that at the  date  of  decision
(20 January 2007) the first appellant  should  have  been  considered  as  a
qualified person within the meaning of reg 6(1)(a) by  virtue  of  the  fact
that he was a jobseeker.  He was prepared to accept that the respondent  was
entitled to treat the period during  which  a  person  could  qualify  as  a
jobseeker as limited to 6 months. In the  appellant's  case,  however,  that
period did not start to run until October 2006,  when  the  first  appellant
began looking for work, having spent the first 3 months in the  UK  (between
July and September) either as  a  self-sufficient  person  or  as  a  person
lawfully exercising his initial right of residence provided for  by  reg  13
of the 2006 Regulations. As regards the latter, he pointed out that  reg  13
established an initial right of residence for a period of 3 months,  subject
only to the requirement that the EEA national hold a valid identity card  or
passport issued by an EEA State and that the  EEA  national  or  his  family
member shall only cease to have the right to reside  under  this  regulation
if he "becomes an unreasonable burden on the  social  assistance  system  of
the United Kingdom...". Mr Idowu relied further on the Home  Office  IDI  at
chapter 4 which states (at least in the undated version he supplied  to  us)
at 3.1.1:

    "3.1.1 Jobseeker
    A 'qualified person' may also be a jobseeker, although the EEA national
    must be able to show evidence that s/he is seeking  employment  and  is
    also able to show a genuine chance of being engaged in employment.


    We would generally expect a jobseeker to  obtain  employment  within  6
    months of beginning  his/her  search.  It  is  highly  likely  that  an
    individual claiming a right of residence as a jobseeker  will  also  be
    exercising Treaty rights as a self-sufficient person.  Jobseekers  have
    no entitlement to access social assistance of  the  host  member  state
    (Article 24(2) of the Directive refers), although they may  in  certain
    circumstances be able to import benefits from their home country, which
    would then be paid to them in the UK by DWP (emphasis added)."

32. We are unable to accept Mr Idowu's contention. It  is  contrary  to  the
clear requirements of reg 6(4). As we have seen, this provision states  that
"jobseeker" means for the purposes of this regulation "a person  who  enters
the United Kingdom in order to seek  employment  and  can  provide  evidence
that he is seeking employment and has a genuine chance  of  being  engaged".
It is a provision which contains three separate requirements:

    - that the applicant be someone who enters the United Kingdom in  order
    to seek employment;
    -  that  the  applicant  can  provide  evidence  that  he  is   seeking
    employment; and
    -that the applicant has a genuine chance of being engaged.

33. On the appellant's own evidence before the immigration  judge  he  never
met the first requirement that he be someone who can  show  he  entered  "in
order to seek employment". When he entered he never had such  an  intention.
He only formed such an intention in October 2006. Accordingly  at  the  date
of decision he did not qualify as a "jobseeker".

34. Mr Idowu urged us not  to  apply  too  literal  approach  to  the  first
requirement contained in reg 6(4)  since  it  would  effectively  mean  that
genuine jobseekers could not qualify as such unless they  had  come  to  the
United Kingdom with the intention of  seeking  employment.  The  Regulations
cannot have been intended to exclude persons like  the  appellant  who  were
Union citizens in a host Member State and who had changed  their  intentions
after entry.

35. In our view even read purposively it is not  possible  to  construe  reg
6(4) in a way which would extend the concept of  jobseeker  to  persons  who
cannot show that on entry they had the intention to seek employment.  To  do
so would be to disregard the clear and express words referring to entry  for
a particular purpose. In considering the meaning of the term "jobseeker"  in
the Regulations we have had regard to the terms of the Citizens'  Directive,
whose provisions the 2006 Regulations  have  sought  to  implement.  As  our
previous  recital  of  relevant  provisions  of  the  Directive  shows,  the
Directive itself does include references to the term "jobseeker".

36. Recital 20 and 21 state that:

    "20. In accordance with the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of
    nationality, all Union citizen and their family members residing  in  a
    Member State on the basis of  this  Directive  should  enjoy,  in  that
    Member State, equal treatment with nationals in areas  covered  by  the
    Treaty, subject to such specific provisions as are  expressly  provided
    for in the Treaty and secondary law.
    21. However, it should be left to  the  host  Member  State  to  decide
    whether it will grant social assistance during the first  three  months
    of residence, or for a longer period in the  case  of  job-seekers,  to
    Union citizens other  than  those  who  are  workers  or  self-employed
    persons or  who  retain  their  status  or  their  family  members,  or
    maintenance assistance  for  studies,  including  vocational  training,
    prior to acquisition of the right to permanent residence, to these same
    persons."


37. Article 7, headed "Right of  residence  for  more  than  three  months",
states at paragraph 3:

    "3.  For the purposes of paragraph 1(a), a  Union  citizen  who  is  no
    longer a worker or self-employed person  shall  retain  the  status  of
    worker or self-employed person in the following circumstances:
    (a) he/she is temporarily unable to work as the result of an illness or
    accident;
    (b) he/she is duly recorded involuntary unemployment after having  been
    employed for more than one year and has registered as a job-seeker with
    the relevant employment office;
    (c) he/she is duly recorded involuntary unemployment after completing a
    fixed-term employment contract of less than  a  year  or  after  having
    become involuntarily unemployed during the first twelve months and  has
    registered as a job-seeker with the relevant employment office. In this
    case, the status of worker shall be  retained  for  no  less  than  six
    months;
    (d)...."

38. Article 14, headed "Retention  of  the  right  of  residence  states  at
paragraph 4:

    "4. By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 and 2 and without  prejudice
    to the provisions of Chapter VI, an expulsion measure may in no case be
    adopted against Union citizens or their family members if:
    (a) the Union citizens are workers or self-employed persons,or
    (b) the Union citizen entered the territory of the host member State in
    order to seek employment. In this case, the Union citizens can  provide
    evidence that they are continuing to seek employment and that they have
    a genuine chance of being engaged."


39. It can be seen that whilst the Directive contains no definition  of  the
term "job-seeker" as such, Article 14(4) casts light on the meaning  of  the
term,  at  least  insofar  as  it  clearly  limits  the  category  of  those
jobseekers against whom it is  prohibited  to  adopt  an  expulsion  measure
(subject to Chapter VI) to those who have entered the territory of the  host
member State "in order to seek employment". In the case of such  persons  it
is expected they can provide evidence  that  they  are  continuing  to  seek
employment and that they have a genuine  chance  of  employment.  We  remind
ourselves too that Article 2(3) defines "Member State" to mean  "the  Member
State to which a Union citizen moves in order to exercise his/her  right  of
free movement and residence". These provisions show that  intention  at  the
point of movement to, or arrival in,  a  Member  State  is  treated  by  the
Directive itself as a proper point of focus.

40. Mr Idowu's second line of argument was that even if the first  appellant
did not qualify as a qualified person under reg 6(1)(a) as a  jobseeker,  he
should still have been seen to qualify as a "worker" under  reg  6(1)(b)  on
the strength of European Community law. As put in ground 13 of  the  grounds
for reconsideration:

    "The  IJ  failed,  refused  or  neglected  to  consider  the   relevant
    provisions of Article 48 of EC Treaty and the ECJ case  C-292/89,  R  v
    IAT, ex parte Antonissen (1991) ECR I - 745, (1991) 2 CMLR 373 at  para
    10 to the effect that the term worker covers job seekers".

41. We think that in general terms Mr Idowu is right to argue  that  if  the
first appellant can show at the date of hearing  he  was  a  "worker"  under
European Community law, he was entitled to succeed  in  his  appeal  on  the
basis that he was a "worker" under reg 6(1)(b). The  only  definition  given
of the term "worker" in the 2006 Regulations is given  at  reg  4(1)(a).  It
states that the term means "a worker within the meaning  of  Article  39  of
the Treaty establishing the European Community". The  meaning  of  the  term
worker within Article 39 has been the subject of extensive jurisprudence  by
the European Court of Justice (hereafter "ECJ" or "Court").

42. Let us turn to that. In Antonissen  the  Court  was  concerned  with  an
applicant who was a Belgian national who had entered the United  Kingdom  in
October 1984. He sought work but was unable to find it.  In  March  1987  he
was sentenced to a term of two years' imprisonment concurrent  with  a  term
of six months' imprisonment on charges of possessing a controlled  drug  and
having a controlled drug in his possession with intent  to  supply."  On  27
November 1987 a deportation order was made against him on  the  ground  that
his  deportation  was  conducive  to  the  public  good.  On   appeal,   the
Immigration Appeal Tribunal decided that he could not invoke the  protection
of Community law from deportation, never having become a worker  because  he
had  not  met  the  requirements  of  paragraphs  140(a)  and  143  of   the
Immigration Rules  (which  applied  a  6  months  test).  In  September  the
applicant had sworn an affidavit stating that:

    "On arriving in England I tried to find employment. I have continued to
    look for employment seriously and repeatedly throughout the  period  of
    my arrival in October 1984 until the present".

43. The first question referred to the Court by Nolan J was:

    "1.For the purpose of determining whether a national of a Member  State
    is to be treated as a "worker" within the meaning of article 48 of  the
    EEC Treaty when seeking employment in the territory of  another  Member
    State so as to be immune  from  deportation  save  in  accordance  with
    Council Directive 64/221 of 25 February 1964, may  the  legislature  of
    the second Member State provide that such a national may be required to
    leave the territory of that State (subject  to  appeal)  if  after  six
    months from  admission  to  that  territory  he  has  failed  to  enter
    employment".

44. The Court made this ruling:

    "It is not contrary to the provisions of Community  law  governing  the
    free movement of workers for the  legislation  of  a  Member  State  to
    provide that a national of another Member State who entered  the  first
    State in order  to  seek  employment  may  be  required  to  leave  the
    territory of that State  (subject  to  appeal)  if  he  has  not  found
    employment there after six months, unless the person concerned provides
    evidence that he is continuing to  seek  employment  and  that  he  has
    genuine chances of being engaged".

45. When the case came back to the High Court, Popplewell  J  said  that  on
the basis of the applicant's history, while he had  had  continued  to  seek
work, he had no genuine chance of securing it and he could  not,  therefore,
at the relevant date, claim the protection of the  Directives  on  the  free
movement of workers (R v Immigration Appeal  Tribunal  ex  parte  Antonissen
[1992] Imm AR 196.

46. In Antonissen and  a  number  of  other  ECJ  judgments,  the  point  is
emphasised that  the concept of "worker" within the meaning  of  Article  48
of the Treaty and  of  Regulation  No  1612/68,  has  a  specific  Community
meaning and must not be interpreted narrowly (e.g. Case  39/86  Lair  [1988]
ECR 3161 [31], [33]; Case No C-171/91 Tsiortras [1993] ECR I 2925 [8],  Case
No C-138/02 Collins [30]). The Court's case-law draws a distinction  between
Member  State  nationals  who  have  not  yet  entered  into  an  employment
relationship in the host Member State where they are looking  for  work  and
those who are already working in the State or who, having worked there,  are
no longer in an employment relationship. Only the latter can claim the  same
social and tax advantages as national workers. However, both  sub-categories
are considered to be workers. The  Court  has  seen  the  extension  of  the
meaning of worker to embrace jobseekers as being implicit in,  for  example,
Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) 1612/68, which  refers  to  a  national  of  a
member state "who seeks  employment  in  the  territory  of  another  member
state". In Collins, the Court said:

    "While Member State nationals who move in search of work  benefit  from
    the principle of equal treatment only as regards access to  employment,
    those who have already entered the employment market may, on the  basis
    of Article 7(2) of Regulation No 1612/68, claim the same social and tax
    advantages as national workers (see in particular, Lebon  [Case  No  C-
    318/85 [1987] ECR 2811] [26] and Commission v Belgium [Case No C-278/94
    [1996] ECR I-4307, [39]-[40].)


    The concept of "worker" is thus not used in Regulation No 1612/68 in  a
    uniform manner. While in Title II of Part I of the regulation this term
    covers only persons who have already entered the employment market,  in
    other parts of the same regulation the  concept  of  "worker"  must  be
    understood in a broader sense."

47. In Case c-85/96 Martinez Sala [1998] ECR I-2691, the  Court  ruled  that
persons seeking work are to be considered to be "workers" for  the  purposes
of Regulation No 1612/68 if the national court is satisfied that the  person
concerned was genuinely seeking work at the appropriate time.  In   RP  (EEA
Regs - worker - cessation) Italy [2006] UKAIT 00025 the Tribunal  emphasised
the importance placed by the Court  when  assessing  whether  someone  is  a
worker on there being on his part no abandonment of the labour  market:  see
Raulin v Minister van Onderwijs en Wetenschappen (Case C-357/89  [1992]  ECR
1027)

48.  Several  propositions  regarding  the  concept  of  worker-as-jobseeker
within European Community  law  can  be  elicited  from  the  cases  already
mentioned. As highlighted in its judgment in Antonissen the Court  considers
that the secondary legislation of the  Community  recognises  that  for  the
purposes of Article 39 the concept of worker includes both  those  who  have
found employment and those  who  are  seeking  work.  Secondly,  as  already
noted, a Union citizen (or EEA national) is  only  a  jobseeker  if  he  has
entered the territory of the host Member State in order to seek  employment.
Thirdly, he can only continue to be a jobseeker for a reasonable period.

49. Here we pause to say something more about the  notion  of  a  reasonable
period. We  are  aware  that  some  commentators  have  seen  the  Court  in
Antonissen as having settled definitively that there  is  a  6  months  time
limit after which a jobseeker ceases to be a worker (indeed  Mr  Idowu  said
that he was prepared to accept that the first appellant was subject to  a  6
months time limit). We think that goes too far: there is no  specific  time-
frame. The Court in Antonissen only settled that a Member State is  entitled
to treat such a time limit as a being generally a reasonable one. The  Court
ruled that a period of 6 months set by the  UK  immigration  rules  then  in
force (HC 251 (paragraph 150)) within which employment must be found is  not
inconsistent with the freedom of movement provisions. (We can  presume  that
even though there is no longer a  6  months  time  limit  contained  in  the
Immigration Rules, the Court would continue to see no  difficulty  with  the
ongoing Home Office practice - as  set  out  in  the  IDIs  -  of  generally
expecting a person to find employment within 6 months.) Furthermore,  it  is
clear that the Court considers that  what  is  a  "reasonable  period"  will
depend  ultimately  on  the  particular   circumstances   of   the   "person
concerned". It follows that a reasonable period could be more or  less  than
a period of 6 months depending on what the  evidence  is  as  to  the  steps
taken by the person concerned  to  seek  employment.  Each  case  should  be
decided on its individual merits looking at the individual's  intentions  in
entering the host Member State, his jobseeking history vis-�-vis the  labour
market and his chances of getting employment.

50. That brings us to a fourth  proposition.  In  the  context  of  deciding
whether a national law requiring a person  to  leave  after  the  end  of  a
reasonable period is consistent with Community law, it  is  still  necessary
to examine whether, at the end of  or  after  that  period,  the  individual
concerned has produced evidence that he is  continuing  to  seek  employment
and has genuine chances of being employed.

51. What is immediately apparent from the above summary of ECJ case  law  on
workers-as-jobseekers is that this case law  imposes  essentially  the  same
requirements as do the 2006 Regulations in respect of jobseekers:  that  the
applicant be someone  who  enters  the  United  Kingdom  in  order  to  seek
employment; that the applicant can  provide  evidence  that  he  is  seeking
employment; and that the applicant has a genuine chance  of  being  engaged.
Thus whether considered under reg  6(1)(a)  as  a  jobseeker  or  under  reg
6(1)(b) as a worker,  an EEA national  who  is  seeking  work  has  to  meet
essentially the same requirements.

52. Going back to what the Court has  said   in  Antonissen  and  other  ECJ
judgments relating to the right of Member States to impose a time  limit  of
a "reasonable period", it has not to  our  knowledge  addressed  in  express
terms the specific issue of whether that time period must run from the  date
of arrival. But in our view it has said enough to make clear  that  whatever
time period  is  considered  to  be  "reasonable",  it  must  be  one  which
commences from the Union citizen's date of arrival in the Member  State:  it
cannot be commenced by such a person choosing to begin  to  seek  employment
at some period after arrival.

53. We acknowledge that the Home Office IDIs might  be  thought  to  suggest
differently in para 3.1.1 where they state that  the  expectation  generally
is that a  jobseeker  obtains  employment  "within  6  months  of  beginning
his/her search" - without specifying anything  about  "beginning"  from  the
date of arrival. However, if the clock for these purposes was only  seen  to
run from when the Union citizen chooses to seek a job, then that could  mean
that a reasonable period of time could in general extend to a  period  of  9
months, comprising  3  months  initial  residence  (to  which  there  is  an
entitlement under reg 13) plus (at least in the UK context, bearing in  mind
the Court's ruling in Antonissen) an additional 6 months. That would  offend
the basic principle enunciated by the Court in Antonissen that the right  to
be considered as a worker even though only a jobseeker  is  based  upon  the
right of a national of another Member State "to move in order  to  look  for
employment,and hence to stay, in another Member State"  ([14])  and  on  the
need to afford to such persons a reasonable time in the host  Member  State,
to  avail  themselves  of  offers  of  employment  corresponding  to   their
occupational qualifications and to take, where  appropriate,  the  necessary
steps in order to be engaged ([21] and [16]  respectively).  It  would  also
fly in the face of the specific wording of that judgment. Para 22 states:

    "It must therefore be stated in reply to the questions submitted by the
    national court that it  is  not  contrary  to  the  provisions  of  the
    Community  law  governing  the  free  movement  of  workers   for   the
    legislation of a Member State to provide that  a  national  of  another
    Member State who entered the first State in order  to  seek  employment
    there may be required to leave the territory of that State (subject  to
    appeal), if he has not found employment there after six months,  unless
    the person concerned provides evidence that he is  continuing  to  seek
    employment and that he has genuine chances of being engaged."

54. We recognise that it might be argued that Article 6,  by  conferring  an
initial right of residence of 3  months  expressed  as  being  "without  any
conditions or any formalities other than the requirement  to  hold  a  valid
identity card or passport", envisages the possibility  of  a  Union  citizen
changing his mind during those 3 months  from  merely  wishing  to  exercise
this right (e.g. as a  holidaymaker)  to  wishing  to  become  a  jobseeker.
However, even if we were somehow able to reconcile this with  the  case  law
requirement going to the intention of the Union citizen  (EEA  national)  at
the time of moving to the Member State, it  does  not  follow  that  such  a
person can be assessed as a jobseeker without regard to whatever  period  of
initial residence he has accumulated up to that point (which could be up  to
a maximum of 3 months). The notion that that  3 months  (or  lesser)  period
cannot be counted in when looking at whether there is  an  (extended)  right
of residence would conflict with subsequent  provisions  of  the  Directive,
Article 7 in particular which clearly treats the period in respect of  which
there exists a " right of residence for more than 3 months" as covering  the
first 3 months ("for a period of longer  than  three  months...";  see  also
recital 10: "...Therefore, the right of residence  for  Union  citizens  and
their family members for  periods  in  excess  of  three  months  should  be
subject to conditions"). At the end of the initial period  of  residence  it
is not therefore as if the Union citizen is necessarily at "Day 1"  for  the
purposes of  assessing  whether  he  is  exercising  Treaty  rights  and  so
entitled to an extended right of residence. That would make a nonsense,  for
example, of the provisions of Article 7(3) which  concern  circumstances  in
which a Union citizen who is "no longer" a worker  or  self-employed  person
shall retain the status of worker or self-employed person.

55. It is also necessary to  have  regard  to  specific  references  in  the
Directive's  preamble  to  jobseekers.  Recital  21,  we  remind  ourselves,
states:

    "However, it should be left to the host Member State to decide  whether
    it will grant social  assistance  during  the  first  three  months  of
    residence, or for a longer period in the case of jobseekers,  to  Union
    citizens other than those who are workers or self-employed  persons  or
    who  retain  that  status  or  their  family  members,  or  maintenance
    assistance  for  studies,  including  vocational  training,  prior   to
    acquisition  of  the  right  of  permanent  residence,  to  these  same
    persons."

56. The reference to a "longer period in the case of  jobseekers"  can  only
mean a period which includes, but is more than, the first 3  months.  If  it
could refer to a Union citizen who waits for  3  months  before  becoming  a
jobseeker the period would not be "longer" because it would only  just  have
started.

57. We also consider that the suggested reading of Article  6  would  render
otiose the reference made in recital 9 to jobseekers. Recital 9,  we  remind
ourselves states that:

    "Union citizens should have the right of residence in the  host  Member
    State for a period, not exceeding three months without being subject to
    any conditions or any formalities other than the requirement to hold  a
    valid identity card or passport, without prejudice to a more favourable
    treatment applicable to jobseekers as recognised by the case-law of the
    Court of Justice.

58. If a person who sought to  base  his  claim  to  an  extended  right  of
residence on his status as a jobseeker could expect not to have  his  period
of  jobseeking counted until the initial 3 months period  of  residence  was
up, then there would be no need to preserve the "more favourable  treatment"
applicable to jobseekers recognised by the Court  of  Justice  -  case  law,
which, we have seen, allows for the possibility, at least in  general,  that
a period  of  6  months  can   be  consistent  with  the  requirement  of  a
"reasonable period" in which to find
employment.

59. There is no justification either for any suggestion that  the  inclusion
in the Citizens' Directive of an initial right of  residence  for  3  months
represents a radical  departure.  In  large  part  it  merely  codifies  the
previous position, as established by Council Directive of 28  June  1990  on
the right of residence (90/364/EEC)  which  at  Article  1  stipulated  that
Member States shall grant the right of  residence  to  nationals  of  Member
States who do not enjoy this right under other provisions of  Community  law
and to members of their families, provided  that  they  themselves  and  the
members of their families are covered by sickness insurance  in  respect  of
all risks in the host Member State and have sufficient  resources  to  avoid
becoming a burden on the social assistance system of the host  Member  State
during their period of residence. When the ECJ decided the  Antonissen  case
in 1991, it cannot have been unaware of this legislation and the  fact  that
it envisaged that  a national of a Member  State  could  move  to  a  Member
State and reside there, even if not a worker,  so long as self-sufficient.

The appellant's circumstances

60.  owever,  HowHApplying  the  case  law  of  the  Court  in  relation  to
jobseekers to the appellant's particular circumstances (on the basis of  the
evidence as it was before the immigration judge),  it is clear  to  us  that
as at the date of decision on 20 January 2007 the first  appellant  was  not
-and had never been - since last arrival,  a  worker.  There  are  two  main
reasons for so concluding.

61. First, on his own account he did not enter the United Kingdom  with  the
intention of seeking employment and he  remained  here  for  some  3  months
before deciding to seek work.

62. Second, he had failed  to  substantiate,  when  requested  by  the  host
Member  State,  that  in  the  period  since  his  arrival  he  was  seeking
employment or that he had a genuine chance of being engaged  in  employment.
Despite a specific request from the Home Office that he provide evidence  in
support of his application to show  he  was  exercising  Treaty  rights,  he
submitted nothing. At the date of  decision,  therefore,  the  Secretary  of
State had no evidence that he was either a jobseeker  or  a  worker  or  any
other sub-category of "qualified person".

63. What  about  the  situation  as  at  the  date  of  hearing  before  the
immigration judge? Section 85(4) of the Nationality, Asylum and  Immigration
Act  2002  governs  this  appeal,  by  virtue  of  reg  26(7)  of  the  2006
Regulations. The  immigration  judge  was  therefore  entitled  to  consider
evidence about any matter which he thought relevant to the substance of  the
decision, including evidence which concerned  a  matter  arising  after  the
date of decision. He heard and received evidence that  the  first  appellant
had  sought  employment  as  a  trainee  bus  driver  from  two  London  bus
companies, one of whom had  informed  him  that  they  had  no  openings  at
present. Were these inquiries enough?  There  was  no  evidence  before  the
immigration judge  of  any  other  efforts  to  find  employment  and  these
inquiries amounted to only two completed job applications. Bearing  in  mind
that by the date of decision in January 2007 his  job-seeking  efforts  over
the period of approximately six months since he entered the  United  Kingdom
in July 2006 amounted to applications to only two  employers,  we  think  he
had not shown he was genuinely seeking employment.  Arguably,  such  limited
efforts did not even demonstrate that he had  been  genuinely  seeking  work
since he began to seek work (some 3 months after arrival).

64. We recognise that it is possible (in the  absence  of  knowing  anything
more precise than that the first appellant last arrived  in  July  2006  and
was refused  on 22 January 2007) that at the date of decision  he  had  been
in the UK slightly less than 6 months. However, for reasons  given  earlier,
what matters from the point of view of Community law is whether or  not  the
period in question is a reasonable one in the  particular  circumstances  of
the case. In finding that the evidence as  it  was  before  the  immigration
judge clearly indicated that the  first  appellant   had  had  more  than  a
reasonable period in which to secure employment by  the  date  of  decision,
there is no conflict either with Home Office  policy,  since  the  reference
therein ( in the IDIs at  3.1.1) to 6  months  is  expressly  stated  to  be
simply a general expectation; it is not stated as a  minimum  period  to  be
applied  irrespective  of  the  individual  circumstances  of   the   person
concerned's case.

65. We are aware, of course, from documentation Mr Idowu  showed  to  us  at
the hearing, that the first appellant appears now to  have  become  employed
with Arriva bus company. He asked us to  treat  this  as  post-determination
evidence casting light back on facts as they stood at the date of  decision,
since it strongly tended to show that he had always had a genuine chance  of
being employed in the field of employment he had chosen. Assuming  that  the
documentation relating to this new job is correct (and having perused it  we
have no reason to doubt it) and that the first  appellant  can  comply  with
the requirements of reg 16(2) by furnishing confirmation of this  engagement
from his employer, then he will  be  entitled  to  obtain  the  registration
certificate he seeks as a 'worker' and his family will  be  able  to  obtain
the residence card documentation they seek as family members  of  a  worker.
However, they cannot obtain such documentation by way of this  appeal  since
it is a state of affairs that has come to pass since the  immigration  judge
heard the appeals and in the absence of there being a material error of  law
in the immigration judge's determination, we cannot have regard to  it  (see
CA [2004] EWCA Civ 1165).




The first appellant as a self-sufficient person: the issue of  comprehensive
sickness insurance cover in the United Kingdom

66. What about the requirement of reg  4(1)(c)(ii)  that  the  EEA  national
have "comprehensive sickness insurance cover in the United Kingdom" and  the
parallel requirement of reg 4(2)(b)  that  "he  and  his  family  have  such
cover"? Mr Idowu  accepted  that  there  was  no  evidence  put  before  the
immigration judge or before us that the appellants met  these  requirements.
Nonetheless, he said, he understood  from  the  second  appellant  (when  he
spoke to her at the hearing before us) that the first  appellant  had  taken
out comprehensive sickness insurance in Germany which covered  him  and  his
family in the UK. We know  from  the  ECJ  judgment  in  Baumbast  and  R  v
Secretary of State for the Home Department (Case  C-413/99)  [2002]  ECR  I-
7091 that it was accepted that comprehensive sickness  insurance  taken  out
in a person's own Member State can fulfil this type of requirement, so  long
as it gives cover in the host Member State. So if the  appellants  had  been
able to substantiate this claim, they could have  expected  to  be  seen  as
having fulfilled the requirements of regulation 4.

67. Can they be said to have substantiated this claim? We  do  not  consider
that the appellants have shown they have  comprehensive  sickness  insurance
cover in the United Kingdom. As the Court of Appeal made clear  in  W(China)
and X(China) v SSHD [2006] EWCA Civ 1494 the possession  of  such  insurance
is something which applicants  have  to  demonstrate:  see  [8].  For  self-
sufficient persons  the  Citizens'  Directive  at  Article  8(3)  imposes  a
specific requirement that they  "...provide  proof  that  they  satisfy  the
conditions laid down therein". In these appeals no documentary  evidence  of
self-sufficiency was produced before  the  immigration  judge  nor  did  the
first appellant's oral evidence make any reference  to  it.  The  burden  of
proof is on the appellants to show that  they  have  such  cover.  They  did
nothing to discharge that burden. Mr Idowu urged us to have regard  to  what
he had been told on instructions by the second appellant during the  hearing
before us, namely that the appellants had such cover  obtained  in  Germany.
However, the hearing before us was an error of law hearing and  in  deciding
whether there is a material error of law we cannot have regard  to  evidence
which was not before the immigration judge. In any event we  do  not  accept
that satisfactory evidence can be created simply by a  representative,  when
quizzed as to why there has been no evidence of such cover  conferring  with
an appellant and then informing the Tribunal that such cover was taken  out.
In  our  view  even  had  we  jurisdiction  to  take  into   account   post-
determination matters, the claim remains unsubstantiated.

68. Thus one of the two necessary requirements of reg  4(c)  cannot  be  met
and for that reason alone the first appellant was not, either  at  the  date
of decision or the date of hearing before the  immigration  judge,  a  self-
sufficient person within the meaning of reg 4(1)(c),  nor  were  his  family
members able to meet the parallel requirement of  reg 4(2).

The first appellant as a self-sufficient person: the  issue  of  sufficiency
of resources

69.  So far as reg 4(1)(c)(i) was concerned, Mr Idowu   contended  that  reg
4(4) clearly envisaged that when it came  to  assessing  whether  the  Union
citizen was 'self-sufficient' his situation had to be considered  so  as  to
take into account the combined resources of the appellant and those  of  his
family members. He pointed out that this  sub-paragraph  made  reference  to
"the resources of the person concerned and,  where  applicable,  any  family
members..."and that reg 4(2)(a) made similar  reference  to  "his  resources
and those of the family members" (emphases added).   He  also  drew  support
also from the provisions of the Home Office IDI  at  para  5,  which  states
that:

    "Furthermore, an EEA national  will  qualify  on  the  basis  of  self-
    sufficiency if his/her spouse, civil partner, or  partner  is  able  to
    support him/her  financially  through  his/her  legal  employment/self-
    employment. Similarly an EEA national will qualify on the basis of self-
    sufficiency if the spouse, civil partner,  or  partner  has  sufficient
    financial resources to support them both, without the need to undertake
    employment or self-employment."

70. In our view these submissions cannot avail the appellants. Even  had  we
been prepared to accept that the appellants  met  the  requirement  to  have
comprehensive sickness insurance cover, we would still not have  found  that
they met requirements of reg 4(4)  or  reg  4(2)(a).   We  are  prepared  to
accept  for  the  purposes  of  this  reconsideration  that  if  the   first
appellant's resources can be treated as  including  the  income  the  second
appellant received from employment, the couple would be able  to  show  that
their joint resources exceeded  the  minimum  level  of  resources  which  a
United Kingdom national and his family members  may  possess  if  he  is  to
become eligible for social  assistance  under  the  United  Kingdom  benefit
system. We did not  have  evidence  about  this,  but  we  consider  we  are
entitled to take judicial notice of the fact that �225 a  week  is  well  in
excess of the applicable benefit rates for the three appellants in force  as
at the date of decision in January 2007.

71. Before proceeding further it is necessary to take stock of the  evidence
relating to the second appellant.  Albeit  incomplete,  the  only  basis  on
which it was said she had an EEA right was that she was a family  member  of
an EEA national. It was not submitted, and there was no  evidence  to  show,
that she had any other basis of entry or stay in the UK. It is a  reasonable
inference, therefore, that she had no lawful permission  to  work.  Even  if
she was entitled to an initial right of residence for  3  months  under  reg
13, that right did not include a right to take  employment.  Moreover,  once
the three months had expired, she could have no lawful basis of stay  unless
able to show she was the family member of a Union citizen who  qualified  as
a self-sufficient person. Subject to her being able to establish a right  of
residence as a family member, therefore, her resources from employment  were
not lawfully acquired.

72. Turning to what guidance is given by ECJ case  law,  we  recognise  that
the Court has frequently emphasised that there are limitations contained  in
the Community law requirement that beneficiaries of the right  of  residence
must not become an "unreasonable" burden on the public finances of the  host
Member State. Mr Idowu is quite right to emphasise that it  is  the  Court's
view  that:  "...those  limitations  and  conditions  must  be  applied   in
compliance with the limits imposed by Community law and in  accordance  with
the principle of proportionality"  (Chen [32], Baumbast [90] and[91]).  Even
so, Mr Idowu's submissions must be rejected. If he were  correct  the  right
to  reside  of  family  members,  despite  being  described  in   both   the
Regulations and the Citizens' Directive as "dependent  upon"  those  of  the
Union citizen (see for example: reg 4(2)), could be  created  by  the  Union
citizen being dependent upon them. Both the Regulations  are  the  Citizens'
Directive make very clear that the right to  reside  of  family  members  is
dependent upon their being  family  members  of  a  Union  citizen  who  can
establish a right to reside in his or her own right. Thus  Article  7(2)  of
the Directive states that:


    The right of residence provided for in  paragraph  1  shall  extend  to
    family members who are not nationals of a Member State, accompanying or
    joining the Union citizen in the host Member State provided  that  such
    Union citizen satisfies the conditions referred to in  paragraph  1(a),
    (b) or (c).(Emphasis added)


73. Put another way,  the  right  of  residence  of  the  family  member  is
premised upon the Union citizen  being  able,  separately,  to  satisfy  the
requirement of self-sufficiency.

74. In similar fashion the right of the family  member  to  take  employment
presupposes that the Union citizen has established a right of  residence  in
his own right. So much is clear from the wording of Article 23:

    "Irrespective of nationality, the family members of a Union citizen who
    have the right of residence or the right of permanent  residence  in  a
    Member State shall be entitled to take up employment or self-employment
    there. (Emphasis added) "

75. As Buxton LJ identified in W(China) and  X(China)  in  relation  to  the
previous directive dealing with self-sufficient persons  (Directive  90/364)
(at [16]):

    "As interpreted by the ECJ in Chen, the article 18 right of Q  and  the
    associated right of her custodians can only be lawfully asserted  under
    the strictly limited conditions imposed by Directive 90/364. The  right
    accordingly does not exist if Q does not have access  to  the  relevant
    resources."

76. It is true that the fact of reverse dependency did not prevent  the  ECJ
in Chen from finding that a young minor who  was  a  national  of  a  Member
State  can  have  his  resources  assessed  by  reference  to  his  parents'
resources [see [44] and [45]-[47]). What motivated  the  Court  to  find  in
favour of  Chen  was  the  Treaty's  general  principle  of  free  movement.
However, in the first place the Court in Chen  confirmed  that  parents  who
were  carers  could  not  qualify  as  "family  members"   under   Community
legislation. In the second  place,  as  the  Tribunal  has  pointed  out  on
several occasions, the resources  of  the  parents  in  Chen  were  acquired
separately from their economic activity in the host State (the  UK).  In  GM
and AM [2006] UKAIT 00059 the Tribunal concluded that an EU  national  child
and its parents could not establish EU rights of residence where the  "self-
sufficiency" could only arise through  reliance  upon  the  parents'  income
derived from employment in the UK.  Its reasoning was as follows:


    "62. The solution may be found in  an  examination  of  the  underlying
    purpose that leads Community law to recognise the derivative  right  of
    free movement for family members  of  EU  nationals  exercising  Treaty
    rights.  Those rights, of course, apply to family members even if  they
    are not themselves EU nationals.  The real  purpose  of  the  right  to
    accompany (or join) and reside with the EU  national  is  that  without
    such a right the EU national could be inhibited from exercising his  EU
    right of free movement and residence.  The starting point is  that  the
    EU national has a right and therefore all principles of  Community  law
    work to avoid difficulties in its exercise.  It follows from that  that
    in a typical case the EU national's right exists independently  of  the
    presence of family members in the host  country.   That  was  also  the
    situation in Chen.  Although the parent/carer had to be in  the  UK  in
    order for the EU national child to exercise  her  right  of  residence,
    that right existed independently of the presence of the family  member.
    The child's self-sufficiency was derived from her parents but it  would
    have existed even if they had not been in the UK - it was derived  from
    their business in China.  The rationale of Chen is that the presence of
    the parent/carer enabled the child to exercise the right it undoubtedly
    - and independently - had.


    63. What is being said in this case is quite different.   Here,  it  is
    said that the parent/carer is entitled to be in the UK and work because
    only then will the child be self-sufficient and hence establish her  EU
    right of residence.  Thus, the family member's presence in the UK  (and
    right to work) is relied upon not in order to avoid a 'clog' or 'chill'
    on the exercise of the right of the EU national  child  but  rather  in
    order to create that very right itself  -  the  right  from  which  the
    family member then seeks to derive his  own  right  to  reside  as  her
    carer/parent.   Only if the parent/carer resides in the UK with the  EU
    national child can it be said that the child has an EU  right  at  all.
    The argument is then exposed for what it is - entirely circular.   Even
    more problematically, it is a circular  argument  that  begins  in  the
    wrong place because it begins with a person who has no right  to  begin
    with, unlike in Chen.  There is  nothing  in  the  Court  of  Justice's
    jurisprudence, in particular in Chen, or anything  in  principle  which
    should cause us to decide that a non-EU family member should be able to
    reside in the UK with an EU national child (not to allow it to exercise
    an existing right but rather) in order to establish the  right  in  the
    first place.  Any right of the family member must be  derived  from  an
    existing right of the EU national which he or she has individually  and
    separately.  That is simply not this case.


    64. Further, if the appellants' arguments are accepted, there would  be
    a number of consequences which we consider  have  no  justification  in
    Community law.


    65. First, it would mean that an EU  citizen  could  enter  and  reside
    within another Member State on the basis of self-sufficiency  providing
    his  accompanying  non-EU  family  member  could   realistically   gain
    employment in the UK.   The family member  would,  thereby,  acquire  a
    right to work equivalent to that of an EU national who wished  to  work
    in another Member State.   That would  elevate  what  has  always  been
    necessarily a derivative right for a non-EU national into  the  primary
    right previously only enjoyed  by  EU  nationals.   In  our  view,  the
    appellant cannot assert a right to work (which he  does  not  otherwise
    possess  as  a  non-EU  national)  in  order  to  establish  the  first
    appellant's right of residence based upon her 'self-sufficiency'.   The
    attempt to supplant the Member State's right to  decide  upon  its  own
    immigration controls in this way has no foundation in Community law.


    66. Second, EC rights of free movement and  residence  were  originally
    conceived as rights conferred upon the economically active, for example
    workers and the self-employed (Roux v Belgium  (Case  C-363/89)  [1991]
    ECR I-273).  Neither appellant does, nor could, rely upon  a  right  of
    this nature.  Rather, they rely upon Article 18, EC  Treaty  introduced
    by the Maastricht Treaty and its progeny in  the  shape  of  Directives
    90/364 and 2004/38 which extend EU  free  movement  rights  in  certain
    circumstances to non-economically active EU citizens and  their  family
    members.  The effect of [counsel  for  the  appellants']  argument,  if
    correct, would confer upon an EU national's  carer/parent  a  right  to
    work (the economically active right) in order that the non-economically
    active right of the EU  national  could  be  established.   We  do  not
    consider that Article 18 and the relevant Directives can be interpreted
    and applied so as to create a right to work  for  the  non-EU  national
    carer/parent in these circumstances.   It is not, in our view, required
    by any of the Court of Justice jurisprudence or any  of  the  arguments
    presented to us."

77. The reasoning in GM and AM was also applied  in  MA  and  others  [2006]
UKAIT 00090 when the Tribunal considered the argument that  income  lawfully
earned in the UK could be relied upon. The Tribunal stated:

    "42.  ....In our view, the EU  national's  right  must  be  established
    independently of the presence of the family members in  the  UK  before
    they may derive any rights from EU law themselves.   This,  it  may  be
    said, is because the right is the right of the EU national.  It  is  an
    individual right, not a family right (although it has consequences  for
    the family); and it must be established on an individual, not a  family
    basis.


    43. Second, we do not see any basis for deciding  that  income  derived
    from the first and second appellants' current employment can  establish
    their daughter's right to reside.  The circularity in establishing  the
    child's rights and then the parents' rights  is  no  less  apparent  in
    these appeals.  Here, the child's self-sufficiency  is  dependent  upon
    her parents working.  They only have a temporary basis for doing so for
    so long as they have limited leave and are  permitted  to  work.   Once
    that leave runs out, there  would  be  no  lawful  basis  for  working.
    Indeed, it seems to us that it is only because  of  these  applications
    and subsequent appeals that the leave did  not  terminate  in  December
    2005 but was continued under s.3C of the Immigration  Act  1971.    The
    only basis for their right to work would then have to be  derived  from
    EU law.  The moment that occurred and they derived a  right  to  reside
    and - it would have to be said -  to  continue  working,  the  position
    would be indistinguishable from that in GM  and  AM.   The  circularity
    would be complete - their right to work would now sustain  the  child's
    right and through her their own derived right would continue.


    44. Third, our conclusion accords with a proper  understanding  of  the
    notion of 'self-sufficiency' and the distinction between free  movement
    in reliance upon economic and, alternatively, non-economic rights.


    45. An EU national who claims to be self-sufficient is not asserting  a
    right to enter and reside in another EU state on the basis of  economic
    activity in that country.  If he were, he would be  seeking  to  enter,
    for example, as a worker or self-employed person.   Rather,  he  relies
    upon his resources which exist independently of any  economic  activity
    in the host Member state.  Once that is established, his family members
    have a derivative right to accompany or join him.  If they did not, the
    EU national's right of free movement might be inhibited or  effectively
    denied to him.  In addition, the  central  EU  legislative  instruments
    give family members a right to work in  that  the  host  Member  state.
    But, their right to work is not a recognition of the right to engage in
    economic activity per se.  Rather, it is simply  a  reflection  of  the
    underlying principle of EU law because otherwise they (and hence the EU
    national) might be inhibited  from  moving  within  the  EU  if  family
    members were not allowed to carry on, what for them,  is  an  important
    aspect of their everyday lives.   The economic activity of  the  family
    members does not establish - nor could it  in  the  context  of  an  EU
    national worker or self-employed person  -  the  EU  national's  right.
    That arises a priori and independently of any economic activity by  the
    EU national or his family in the host EU country.


    46. By contrast, in  the  Chen-type  case  the  EU  national  can  only
    establish his right by reliance upon  economic  activity  in  the  host
    Member state, not, of course, economic activity by himself  but  rather
    by his family members.  We see no reason to distort the usual situation
    simply because the EU national is a child and is dependent upon  others
    for support and, unusually, is already present in the host  EU  country
    with his family members rather  than  seeking  to  enter  it  with  his
    family.  Here  too,  the  right  of  free  movement  based  upon  self-
    sufficiency  cannot  depend  upon  resources  derived  from  employment
    engaged in by the EU national or his family members in the UK.
    ...
    48. In the result, therefore, the reasoning of the Tribunal in  GM  and
    AM is applicable where an EU national child places reliance upon income
    derived from a parent lawfully working in the UK  during  a  period  of
    limited leave restricted for a specific purpose or, which is  not  this
    case, who is on temporary admission and not  prohibited  from  working.
    In such circumstances, a Member  State  is  entitled  to  restrict  the
    rights of employment of non-EU nationals, in particular  to  limit  the
    duration of their permission to work just as it is entitled effectively
    to prohibit their ability to work (see, W(China) and X(China)).    When
    it does so, that individual cannot  derive  a  right  to  reside  as  a
    "family member" of an EU national because that income cannot  be  taken
    into account in order to establish the EU national's right of residence
    on a self-sufficient basis."

78. Before moving away from relevant  case  law,  we  need  to  address  one
further ECJ case. It is Case C-408/03, Commission v Belgium 23  March  2006.
It was not cited to us by either of the parties but since  it  is  the  only
ECJ judgment to deal post-Chen with the issue  of  sufficiency  of  personal
resources it is imperative that we analyse it, to see whether our  reasoning
is compatible with it. It concerned an action brought by the  Commission  in
respect of the requirement imposed by the  Kingdom  of  Belgium  making  the
right of residence of family  members  of  Union  citizens  subject  to  the
requirement that they have sufficient personal resources. According  to  the
case  file  the  Court  noted  that  the  Commission  had  received  various
complaints about Belgian legislation and administrative practice  concerning
both the conditions for granting residence permits  under  Directive  90/364
and orders to leave Belgian territory issued to citizens of the  Union.  The
Commission was said to have been particularly struck by the situation  of  a
Portuguese national, a Mrs De Figueiredo, who had entered Belgium  with  her
three daughters in August 1999 to live with  her  long-standing  partner,  a
Belgian national. There was seemingly no dispute that the  Belgian  national
had sufficient means to support  her  and  her  children,  but  the  Belgian
authorities ordered her to leave on the ground that she did not  fulfil  the
requirement of sufficient resources laid down in Article 1 of the  Directive
90/364, stating that the undertaking to support her given  by  him  did  not
constitute evidence that she had sufficient  resources.   The  Court  ruled,
inter alia, that:

    "by excluding the income of a partner residing in the host Member State
    in the absence of an agreement concluded before a notary and containing
    an assistance clause, the Kingdom of Belgium has failed to  fulfil  its
    obligations under Article 18 and Council Directive 90/364  of  28  June
    1990 on  the  right  of  residence  when  applying  that  directive  to
    nationals of a Member State who wish to rely on their rights under  the
    directive and on Article 18 EC".

79. We do not think this ruling assists the instant cases. The resources  of
the family member in question consisted  in  income  lawfully  earned  by  a
national of the host Member State (her Belgian partner), not  income  earned
unlawfully by a  third-country  national.  Neither  this  judgment  nor  the
judgment in Chen can be taken to support  the  quite  different  proposition
that self-sufficiency can be established by  income  earned  by  the  family
member of a Union citizen - irrespective of whether that income  was  earned
lawfully and on the basis of an independent right to work (see GM and AM  at
[52]).

80. Of course, none of the above decisions specifically addresses  reg  4(4)
of the 2006 Regulations.  This  fact  obliges  us  to  consider  Mr  Idowu's
separate contention  that the Directive permits Member States  to  introduce
or retain more favourable provisions (Article 37) and  that  -  irrespective
of what the Directive provides - the wording of reg 4(4)  denotes  that  the
EEA national can establish  self-sufficiency  by  reliance  on  the  non-EEA
national's earnings.

81. However, it does not seem to us that the meaning of  reg  4(4)  is  that
the self-sufficiency of an EEA national can be  established  by  aggregating
his resources and those of his family  member(s)  -irrespective  of  whether
the resources of the family  member(s)  have  been  lawfully  acquired.  Its
purpose is twofold. First it establishes that the family as a group must  be
self-sufficient: it is not enough for the EEA national's resources to  cover
only what is necessary for his personal support. Second, it is  intended  to
identify the level at which the family's resources are to  be  assessed,  by
reference to the eligibility  threshold  for  social  assistance  under  the
United Kingdom benefit system. Nor can  the  word  "resources"  be  read  as
having no limitations beyond allowing all or any resources to be taken  into
account. It cannot extend, for example, to ill-gotten gains of  a  fraud  or
other crime. If it did it would violate the  Community  law  principle  that
rights must not be abused: see Centros Ltd v Erhvervs-og  Selskabestyrelssen
(Case C-212/97) [1999] ECR I-1459, Citizens' Directive, Article 35.

82. We have also considered Mr Idowu's reliance on the IDI entry at para  5.
However, as he himself acknowledged, we have to apply  the  Regulations  and
the IDIs are at most an aid to construction  of  the  Regulations.  Secondly
what the relevant passage in para 5 contemplates is a spouse, civil  partner
or partner able to support the Union citizen through "legal employment/self-
employment" (emphasis added). That does not assist  a  family  member  whose
employment is only legal if the right to reside of  the  Union  citizen  has
been shown to exist on the basis of his/her  personal  self-sufficiency.  It
may be under these policy  instructions  that  the  position  is  considered
different if the spouse, civil partner or partner has  sufficient  financial
resources to support them both without the need to undertake  employment  or
self-employment (as in Case C-408/03,  Commission v Belgium),  but  that  is
not the case here and this provision seems consistent with the  approach  of
the European Court of Justice in Chen of permitting account to be  taken  of
resources which such persons have  before  they  come  to  the  host  Member
State.

83.  Accordingly  the  evidence  before  the  immigration  judge  failed  to
establish that the first appellant was either a jobseeker or worker or self-
sufficient person. The first appellant not being  a  qualified  person,  his
family members did not have a right to reside. All  three,  therefore,  were
properly refused the confirmatory documentation which  they  sought  in  the
form  of  a  registration  certificate  (for  the  first  appellant)  and  a
residence card for the first and second appellants.  Hence  the  immigration
judge, whilst he erred in law, did not err materially.

Proof and verification

84. We noted earlier that the first appellant's case  had  certain  features
all too commonly encountered  in  appeals  brought  by  persons  seeking  to
establish EU rights  of  free  movement  or  residence,  namely  a  lack  of
relevant evidence. It was the failure of the first appellant to  respond  to
the Home Office request for relevant evidence (of  his  exercise  of  Treaty
rights) which led the Home Office to refuse his  application  (and  that  of
his wife and child). Whilst by the date  of  hearing  he  had  adduced  some
relevant evidence, there were still significant omissions.

85. What are the consequences of such omissions?  It  was  not  uncommon  in
earlier times in the context of EEA appeals by persons  whom  the  Secretary
of   State   considered   had   entered   marriages   of   convenience   for
representatives to submit that it was for the Secretary of  State  to  prove
that their marriage  lacked  substance.  In  Chang  (EEA  Nationals-Spouses)
Malaysia* [2001] UKIAT 00012 the Immigration  Appeal  Tribunal  declined  to
decide the issue (because of a  concession  by  the  parties),  but  gave  a
strong indication that it  would  find  such  submissions  ill-founded.  The
Tribunal stated:

    "43. Before the Adjudicator it was common ground  that  the  Respondent
    had the burden of proving that the Appellant's marriage was  a  'sham'.
    The position before  us  was  the  same.   For  the  purposes  of  this
    determination we accept it, but it appears to us that that position (as
    to both burden and standard) might properly  be  reconsidered  in  some
    other case.  So far as concerns burden, the burden of proof  is,  as  a
    matter of the general law,  usually  on  the  party  who  asserts.   We
    should, if we were required to make a decision on the matter, have been
    inclined rather to say that it is the Appellant who asserts that he  is
    a spouse who has a right of residence than that he merely asserts  that
    he is a spouse, leaving the Respondent to deny that he has a  right  of
    residence.  We are fortified in that view by the provisions of Rule  31
    of  the  1984  Rules  (which  applied  to  this   appeal   before   the
    Adjudicator).   So  far  as  concerns  standard,  a  high  standard  is
    appropriate in cases where misconduct is alleged: but,  as  at  present
    advised, we are not persuaded that there is anything  inherently  wrong
    in marrying for convenience and taking any advantages  that  flow  from
    the relationship - provided, of course, that no deception is involved."


86. Notwithstanding this indication it appears that efforts to cling  on  to
the approach that somehow the burden of proof  rests  on  the  Secretary  of
State in EEA appeals generally have not diminished.

87. We do not know the precise reasons for the  lack  of  evidence  in  this
case, they may indeed not have been motivated by this type of approach.  But
given that we still see lack of evidence  as  a  feature  in  a  significant
number of EEA appeals, it is important that we seek  to  dispel  a  possible
myth which has grown up around such appeals.

88. It is true that the  Directive  imposes  on  Member  States  a  duty  of
examination. Article 3 states in its final sentence that: "The  host  Member
State  shall  undertake   an   extensive   examination   of   the   personal
circumstances and shall justify any denial of entry or  residence  to  these
people". Equally, it is an important aspect of  Community  law  relating  to
the right to free movement of persons that since that right is  one  of  the
"founding freedoms" established by the Treaty, it is to  be  given  a  broad
meaning and conditions and limitations  placed  upon  it  must  be  narrowly
construed. As expressed  in  recital  14,  in  relation  to  the  supporting
documentation required by the competent authorities for  the  issuing  of  a
registration  certificate  or  of  a  residence  card,  these   "should   be
comprehensively  specified  in  order  to  avoid  divergent   administrative
practices or interpretations constituting an undue obstacle to the  exercise
of the right of residence by Union citizens and their  family  members".  So
there is a need for legal certainty. And administrative formalities are  not
to obstruct the exercise of that right: see e.g. Article 25(1).  In  certain
contexts Member States are restricted from  demanding  proof  beyond  a  set
minimum. Thus by Article 6 (see also recital 9)  the  conditions  placed  on
the initial right of residence for Union citizens are  strictly  limited  to
the requirement to hold a valid identity card or passport:  "...without  any
conditions or any formalities other than the requirements  to  ...").   Thus
for a registration certificate  to  be  issued  Article  8  prescribes  that
"Member States may only require..." a limited number of  documents:  in  the
case of workers, for example, this is confined to a valid identity  card  or
passport  and  a  confirmation  of  engagement  from  the  employer   or   a
certificate of employment or  proof  that  they  are  self-employed  persons
(Article  8(3)).   In  certain  contexts  the  requirements  of  proof   are
deliberately lessened. Thus in the case of students they are  only  required
to present a valid identity card or  passport,  proof  of  enrolment  at  an
accredited establishment  and  of  comprehensive  sickness  insurance  cover
together with "a declaration  or  by  such  equivalent  means  as  they  may
choose, that they have sufficient resources for themselves and their  family
members..." (Articles 7(1)(c) and (3).  In the context of retention  of  the
right of residence (not we note  initial  establishment  of  such  a  right)
Article 14(2) states that  whilst  Member  States  are  entitled  to  verify
whether the conditions set out in Articles 7, 12 and 13 are fulfilled  "[i]n
specific cases where there is a reasonable doubt",  this  verification  "may
not be carried out systematically".

89. However, none of these requirements shift the burden of proof  from  the
applicant or appellant and, where there is any lessening of the  requirement
to prove certain facts, this are the subject of specific provision.  In  the
absence of such specific provision, it is clear that  it  is  an  underlying
principle of Community law that  Member  States  are  entitled  under  their
national laws to require appellants to prove  they  possess  the  EU  rights
they claim. Furthermore, in relation  to  persons  seeking  to  establish  a
right to reside on the basis of self-sufficiency  the  Directive  identifies
this burden quite specifically, Article 8(3) stating that such persons  must
present a valid identity card or  passport  "and  provide  proof  that  they
satisfy  the  conditions  laid  down  therein".   This   provision   mirrors
established case law. Thus in Case No C-408/03  Commission  v  Belgium   the
Court states at [64]:

    "However,  as  the  right  of  residence  under  Article  18   is   not
    unconditional, it is for the  citizens  of  the  Union  to  adduce  the
    necessary evidence that they meet the  conditions  laid  down  in  that
    regard by the relevant Community provisions."

90. What the above means for applicants and appellants seeking  to  rely  on
EEA rights is  that  unless  able  to  point  to  a  specific  provision  of
Community  law  limiting  the  need  to  produce  evidence,  applicants  and
appellants must expect that a failure to produce relevant evidence may  well
mean that the decision in their case will be a negative one, based on  their
failure to substantiate that they have any EEA right.

91. So far as the standard  of  proof  is  concerned,   Keene  LJ  ruled  in
Zackaria Muhidin Ali [2006] EWCA Civ 486 that under  (the  then  applicable)
EEA Regulations, he could " see no basis on which it could be said that  the
judge was wrong to apply the normal civil standard of proof".

92. Nothing we say here should be taken as attempting to furnish any  answer
to the separate question of whether the (legal and/or evidential) burden  of
proof  shifts to the host member State when  it  is  seeking  to  deprive  a
person of an existing right of  residence,  most  clearly  in  the  case  of
revocation  of  residence  documentation.  Our  focus  in   this   case   is
exclusively on persons seeking to establish such a right.

93. To conclude, the immigration judge did err in law in two  respects  when
assessing whether the first appellant was a jobseeker or a  self  sufficient
person or both. His errors were not, however, material ones,  since  on  the
evidence before the immigration judge the first appellant did not  meet  the
requirements  of  being  a  jobseeker  within  the  meaning  of   the   2006
Regulations. Nor did that evidence establish that he was  a  self-sufficient
person.

94. For the above reasons, the immigration judge did not materially  err  in
law and so his decision to dismiss the appellants' appeals must stand.
