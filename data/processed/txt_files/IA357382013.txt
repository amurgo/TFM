Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr TDH Hodson, instructed by Elder Rahimi Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Caro Nwachukwu, date of birth 23.10.68, is a citizen  of
    Nigeria.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Telford promulgated on 4.8.14, who dismissed her  appeal  against
    the decision of the respondent, dated 6.8.13, to refuse her application
    for a residence card as confirmation of a retained right  of  residence
    as the former spouse of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights in the
    UK, pursuant to the Immigration (EEA)  Regulations  2006,  as  amended.
    The Judge heard the appeal on 9.7.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Brunnen  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    19.8.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 10.10.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Telford should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background is that the appellant first came to the  UK  in
    2001 as a family visitor but overstayed.  On  1.11.03  in  the  UK  the
    appellant married Jerome Rene Jean Drouart, a French  national.  It  is
    alleged that they lived together until 2006, when Mr Drouart  left  the
    appellant. Divorce proceedings were instituted in 2008 and finalised on
    25.2.10.

 7. A previous application for a permanent residence card was made  by  the
    appellant in 2008, based on her being a family member, was  refused  on
    21.3.10 and the appeal dismissed by Immigration  Judge  O'Connor  in  a
    determination promulgated on 10.8.2010. In that hearing  the  appellant
    stated she last knew of her former husband's whereabouts in 2006. Judge
    O'Connor found that she was not entitled to permanent residence  status
    as she had only lived with Mr Drouart as her spouse for a period  of  3
    years, and thus short of the  5  year  period  required.  It  was  also
    asserted on the appellant's behalf that she was entitled to a  retained
    right of residence under  regulation  10(5).  However,  Judge  O'Connor
    found that the appellant had failed to demonstrate that her  ex-husband
    was in the UK and exercising Treaty rights at the date  of  termination
    of marriage, 25.2.10.

 8. In the First-tier Tribunal appeal before Judge Telford  the  respondent
    did not dispute the issue of regulation 10(6). Nevertheless, the  judge
    concluded that the appellant had failed to  demonstrate  that  her  ex-
    husband was exercising Treaty rights at the  date  of  her  divorce  in
    2010. Reliance had been placed on a Home Office policy,  dated  4.8.11,
    entitled 'Pragmatic Approach (revised),' dealing, inter alia, with  the
    difficulties faced by former spouses in complying with regulation 10 of
    the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006. As I understand it, Mr Hodson's
    submissions to the First-tier Tribunal were  to  the  effect  that  the
    Secretary of State failed to consider and apply the policy and thus  it
    was argued that the refusal decision of 6.8.13 was  not  in  accordance
    with the law and the matter should be  returned  to  the  Secretary  of
    State for a decision to be made  in  accordance  with  the  law.  Judge
    Telford did not agree. He found that the application of the policy  had
    not been triggered because of a number of features of the case.  First,
    the policy, or its predecessor, was not raised as an issue in the  2010
    appeal and the  appellant  had  taken  no  steps  since  that  date  to
    establish  the  whereabouts  and  circumstances  of  Mr   Drouart.   No
    application had been made by the appellant or her representative  prior
    to or subsequent to the 2010 hearing for any order of discovery of  any
    document which may have  been  relevant  to  assist  her  to  meet  the
    requirements of the regulations and in particular  whether  Mr  Drouart
    was in the UK and exercising Treaty rights at the date of  finalisation
    of the divorce. The judge also found that the appellant  did  not  meet
    the requirements of the policy by  showing  that  she  had  made  every
    effort to provide the required documents, which is  the  second  bullet
    point example under paragraph 2 of the policy.  Hence  the  appeal  was
    dismissed.

 9. In essence, the rather lengthy grounds of appeal submit that the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge erred  in  law  in  making  unsustainable  findings
    concerning the appellant's contention that the respondent had failed to
    consider and apply the published policy.

10. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Brunnen  stated  only  that  he
    found the grounds were arguable.

11. Mr Hodson argues that the Secretary of State should have considered the
    policy and/or given reasons for not applying the policy.  It  is  clear
    from the determination of the First-tier Tribunal  that  Judge  Telford
    gave very anxious scrutiny to the policy. Mr Hodson said that  was  the
    wrong approach, and that the judge  should  have  decided  whether  the
    Secretary of State should have applied the policy. The refusal decision
    is silent as to the policy.

12. The respondent's position is that the policy is not applicable and  the
    decision was in accordance with the law, and thus that no error of  law
    is disclosed in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

13. I can see from ï¿½25 that the judge was alive to the issue as to  whether
    the Secretary of State had complied with her published policy. However,
    for the reasons given, Judge Telford was not satisfied that the  policy
    was not considered, or that in any event it applied in the  appellant's
    circumstances.

14. Before I can accept that there was an error of law in the making of the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal I must be satisfied that the policy
    is applicable, should have been considered by the Secretary  of  State,
    and if applied would or could have resulted in a different  outcome  to
    the application and appeal.

15. The policy is expressed in paragraph  1  as  applying  where  a  family
    member is unable to meet the requirements of the  regulations  "due  to
    the exceptional circumstances of the application."

16. Paragraph 2 indicates that  applications  on  the  basis  of  having  a
    retained right of residence should be treated pragmatically where there
    is a breakdown in the relationship between the appellant and their  EEA
    national sponsor. "This is because it  may  not  be  possible  for  the
    applicant  to  provide  the  required  documents   to   support   their
    application." Two bullet point examples are cited, the first where  the
    applicant is the victim of domestic violence, and the second where  the
    relationship has ended acrimoniously but they have provided evidence to
    show  that  they  have  made  every  effort  to  provide  the  required
    documents, for example attempts to make contact with the  EEA  national
    sponsor during divorce proceedings.

17. Paragraph states that each case must be  looked  at  according  to  its
    individual merits, "and where they are satisfied that there is a  valid
    reason why the applicant  is  unable  to  get  the  required  evidence,
    enquiries must be made on behalf of the applicant where possible."

18. Elsewhere in the policy document it makes it clear that  the  applicant
    is expected to provide as  much  detail  as  they  can  about  the  EEA
    national sponsor and that enquiries with HMRC must only be  done  where
    the caseworker is sure that  the  applicant  cannot  get  the  required
    evidence.

19. Mr Hodson points to the covering letter  with  the  application,  which
    referenced the policy, and the  appellant's  divorce  affidavit,  dated
    19.3.09. It is  submitted  that  the  ex-husband  was  frustrating  the
    divorce proceedings by giving  the  appellant's  address  as  his  own,
    although he left there on 17.10.06  and  never  returned.  He  made  no
    effort to participate in the  divorce  proceedings  and  the  appellant
    states she has not spoken to him since  2006  and  does  not  know  his
    whereabouts. She provided a copy of his passport with her  application.
    A handwritten statement of a friend states that in  2008  she  assisted
    the appellant to look for Mr Drouart and drove her to an address  given
    for him at that time, 9 Lansbury Way, but the local residents  did  not
    know him.

20. In assessing the facts, Judge Telford reached the conclusion  that  the
    appellant  had  not  made  'every  effort'  to  provide  the  necessary
    documents to establish her case. It was not clear that Mr  Drouart  was
    even in the UK at the date of termination of marriage,  he  having  not
    participated  in  the  divorce  proceedings.  Judge  Telford  found  no
    evidence that the appellant was unable to obtain evidence  of  her  ex-
    spouse. The judge also considered after the delay of some 4 years since
    the divorce such  enquiries  might  be  pointless  when  there  was  no
    evidence of any contact with the appellant or the  court  system  since
    that date. The only contact since he left her in 2006 was to return the
    acknowledgement of service of the divorce petition in 2008. She  failed
    to follow up with her present or previous solicitors,  even  after  the
    dismissal of the previous appeal. No enquiries other than those  listed
    herein were made to locate Mr Drouart. As Judge Telford put it at  ï¿½27,
    "She has made simply no effort since the divorce to provide evidence of
    any efforts she made. She has provided no  evidence  that  having  made
    those enquiries she contacted the respondent to say what enquiries  she
    had made and that they  had  proved  fruitless  ...  She  has  made  no
    application to the court for any  direction."  The  judge  reached  the
    conclusion that on the circumstances of this case the policy would  not
    have been engaged and that in any event after a delay of 4  years  such
    enquiries would be pointless as evidence that Mr Drouart  was  even  in
    the UK at the date of divorce. At ï¿½21 the judge  did  not  accept  that
    there  were  exceptional  circumstances  in  this  case,  or  that  the
    appellant's circumstances were akin to  those  examples  cited  in  the
    policy.

21. The burden remains on the appellant to demonstrate that her  ex-partner
    was exercising Treaty rights at the date of termination of marriage.  I
    do not accept that the burden shifts  to  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    assist the appellant where she has made little if any effort to provide
    the necessary evidence and simply says, 'I don't know where he is,' and
    has done nothing about it since 2010.  Judge  Telford  made  a  careful
    assessment at the appeal hearing as to what efforts had  been  made  by
    the appellant.

22. In  all  the  circumstances,  I  find  that  the  appellant  failed  to
    demonstrate that either she had made sufficient effort so as to  engage
    the policy, or that her circumstances were such  that  the  policy  was
    engaged at all on the facts of this case. I am not satisfied that there
    were or are exceptional circumstances in this case. Or that the refusal
    decision was not in accordance with the  law  by  failing  to  consider
    and/or apply the policy, or that Judge Telford was in error by  failing
    to allow the appeal to the limited extent that he should have found the
    decision of the Secretary of State not in accordance with the law.

23. I further note that it is open to  the  appellant  to  make  a  further
    application, demonstrating that she  has  made  reasonable  efforts  to
    trace her ex-husband. On the present evidence she has done  practically
    nothing since 2008.

Conclusion & Decision:

24. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.






Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.
