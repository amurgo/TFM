                                                                  Respondent


Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr Brown, Counsel instructed by Jiva Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

This has been a remote hearing to which both parties have consented. The
form of remote hearing was video by Microsoft Teams (V). A face to face
hearing was not held because it was not practicable and all issues could be
determined in a remote hearing. I did not experience any difficulties, and
neither party expressed any concern, with the process.


                                CONSENT ORDER



Background

      1. Following submissions from Mr Brown, Mr Deller (a) conceded that
         the adverse credibility findings of the First-tier Tribunal were
         inadequately reasoned and could not stand; (b) agreed with Mr Brown
         that the decision should be re-made by a different judge in the
         First-tier Tribunal; and (c) agreed with Mr Brown to dispose of the
         proceedings by way of a consent order.



Decision

      2. Pursuant to Rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
         Rules 2008 and by the consent of the parties I make the following
         order:

      3. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside and the appeal
         is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be made afresh by a
         different judge with no findings preserved.
