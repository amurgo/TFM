                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction and Background

 1. The Entry Clearance Officer (ECO)  appealed  against  the  decision  of
    Judge Crawford of the First-tier Tribunal (the FtT) promulgated on  7th
    April 2015.

 2. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and I will refer to her as the Claimant.

 3. The Claimant is a female citizen of Bangladesh born 20th July 1992  who
    applied for entry clearance to the United Kingdom  as  the  partner  of
    Abdul Hashim (the  Sponsor),  a  British  citizen.   The  Claimant  and
    Sponsor have a British child born 18th June 2013 who resides with  the
    Claimant in Bangladesh.

 4. The application was refused on 27th May 2014.  The issue that  concerns
    the Upper Tribunal is the refusal  on  the  basis  that  the  financial
    requirements of the Immigration Rules were not satisfied.

 5. The ECO did  not  accept  that  the  requirements  of  E-ECP.3.3(b)  of
    Appendix FM were satisfied which for ease of reference I set out below;



         E-ECP.3.3.    (b) the applicant must provide  evidence  that  their
                      partner  is  able   to   maintain   and   accommodate
                      themselves,  the   applicant   and   any   dependants
                      adequately in  the  UK  without  recourse  to  public
                      funds.

    The ECO calculated that a couple with one dependent child  required  at
    least �195.77 per  week  after  accommodation  costs  in  order  to  be
    adequately maintained without recourse to public funds.  This is what a
    couple with one dependent child would receive by way of  benefits.   It
    was contended that the Sponsor's income amounted to �173.15  per  week,
    and therefore adequate maintenance would not be available.

 6. The Claimant's appeal was heard by the FtT on 26th March 2015.  The FtT
    found that because the child of the Sponsor and Claimant is  a  British
    citizen, he need not be taken into account when calculating the minimum
    income required in order to satisfy adequacy of maintenance.   The  FtT
    relied upon the definition of a "child" in  E-ECP.3.1  of  Appendix  FM
    which states that a dependent child is;

         (a)  under the age of 18 years, or who was  under  the  age  of  18
             years when they were first granted entry under this route;
         (b)  applying for entry clearance as a dependant of the  applicant,
             or has limited leave to enter or remain in the UK;
         (c)  not a British citizen or settled in the UK; and
         (d)  not an EEA national with a right  to  be  admitted  under  the
             Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

 7. The FtT found that because the child in this case is a British citizen,
    he could be disregarded when considering adequacy of  maintenance,  and
    the FtT found that the Claimant satisfied the financial requirements of
    Appendix FM and therefore allowed  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 8. The ECO was granted permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.   The
    ECO contended that the FtT had erred in considering the definition of a
    dependent child as set out in E-ECP.3.1, as the application  needed  to
    be considered under E-ECP.3.3 which meant that any dependants had to be
    taken into account when assessing  adequacy  of  maintenance.   It  was
    further noted that the FtT had recorded an amount  of  savings  at  the
    time of application, but had not followed  the  guidance  in  Jahangara
    Begum Bangladesh [2011] UKUT 00246 (IAC) and carried out an  assessment
    as to whether those savings could make up the shortfall in  income  for
    the period of the initial visa.

Error of Law

 9. The appeal came before me on 24th November 2015 and  I  concluded  that
    the FtT had materially erred in law and therefore the decision  of  the
    FtT was set aside.  I prepared an error of law decision and directions
    which was promulgated on 11th December 2015, and for ease of reference
    set out below  the  conclusions  and  reasons  for  setting  aside  the
    decision of the FtT, which were contained in paragraphs 14-19  of  that
    decision;

         14. "    I announced at the hearing that I found that the  FtT  had
             materially  erred  in  law  as  contended  by  the  ECO.   The
             definition  contained  in  E-ECP3.1   means   that   when   an
             application is being  assessed  under  that  paragraph,  which
             requires a specified gross annual income of at least  �18,600,
             and an additional  �3,800  for  the  first  child,  a  British
             citizen child could be disregarded.
         15.  However, this application was not  assessed  under  E-ECP.3.1,
             but  was  assessed  under  E-ECP.3.3  which  is   a   separate
             paragraph.  There is  no  requirement  of  a  specified  gross
             annual  income  of  at  least  �18,600,  nor  is   there   any
             requirement that there should be an additional �3,800 for  the
             first child.  The assessment under E-ECP.3.3  is  whether  the
             parties would  be  able  to  accommodate  themselves  and  any
             dependants adequately in the UK  without  recourse  to  public
             funds.
         16.  In my view it is clear that E-ECP.3.3 is a separate  paragraph
             from E-ECP.3.1, and there is reference in E-ECP.3.3(b) to  any
             dependants.
         17.  The FtT was therefore wrong in law to  disregard  the  British
             citizen child from the financial calculations.  Had the  child
             been  included  in  the  calculations,  both   representatives
             indicated that it was accepted that there would be a shortfall
             in income of �22.62 per week.
         18.  I find that the FtT did not consider the Claimant's savings in
             accordance with the principles in Jahangara Begum.
         19.  Therefore the decision of the FtT had to be set aside. "

10. Having announced at the error of law hearing, that the decision of  the
    FtT  was  set  aside,  I  granted  Mr  Hussain's  application  for   an
    adjournment, which was made without  objection.   The  purpose  of  the
    adjournment was to enable Mr Hussain to provide evidence in relation to
    benefits to which the British child may be entitled, and to  produce  a
    calculation in relation to savings, if there was a shortfall in income.



Re-Making the Decision

Preliminary Issues

11. I ascertained that I had received  all  documentation  upon  which  the
    parties intended to rely, and that each party had served the other with
    any documentation upon which reliance was to  be  placed.   I  had  the
    documents that were before the FtT, those being  the  ECO  bundle,  the
    Claimant's initial bundle comprising  25  pages,  and  a  supplementary
    bundle comprising 9 pages.  Subsequent to the error of law hearing, the
    Claimant had submitted a  second  supplementary  bundle  comprising  14
    pages.  Mr Hussain handed in at the hearing Ahmed (benefits:  proof  of
    receipt; evidence) [2013] UKUT 00084 (IAC) and Mr Hussain advised  that
    no further evidence would be called.





The ECO's Submissions

12. Mr McVeety referred to the calculation contained within the  Claimant's
    latest bundle, and  pointed  out  that  the  savings  at  the  date  of
    decision, did not make up the shortfall in income.

13. The main issue in Mr McVeety's view was whether the child  benefit  and
    child tax credit which the British child would be entitled  to  receive
    upon entry to the UK, could be taken  into  account  in  the  financial
    calculation, because the child was not receiving  this  income  at  the
    date of refusal, and because this was  an  appeal  against  refusal  of
    entry clearance, the Tribunal  needed  to  consider  the  circumstances
    appertaining at the date of refusal.  It was therefore  submitted  that
    the child benefit and child tax credit could not be taken into  account
    which would mean that  there  was  a  shortfall  in  income,  when  the
    Sponsor's income was compared with that  of  an  equivalent  family  in
    receipt of benefit, and therefore adequate  maintenance  would  not  be
    available and the appeal should  be  dismissed  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

14. With reference to Article 8 outside the  rules,  Mr  McVeety  submitted
    that the Claimant had not demonstrated any compelling circumstances  to
    justify allowing the appeal under Article 8 outside the rules,  if  the
    financial requirements of the rules could not be met.

The Claimant's Submissions

15. Mr Hussain relied upon the financial calculations contained at pages  1
    and  2  of  the  Claimant's  latest  bundle.   He  submitted  that  the
    Claimant's British child  would  be  entitled  to  receive  both  child
    benefit and child tax credit when he came to the UK, and therefore that
    would give additional income of �84.64 per week, which  when  added  to
    the �173.15 the Sponsor already receives exceeded the  sum  of  �195.77
    which would be payable to a family of  two  adults  and  one  dependent
    child by way of benefit, and therefore adequate  maintenance  would  be
    available.

16. Mr Hussain referred to Ahmed, and pointed out that what should be taken
    into account is the projected income of the family, when  the  Claimant
    arrives in the UK.  I was asked to accept that the provision contained
    within the Immigration Rules, that  there  should  be  no  recourse  to
    public funds meant no additional recourse to public funds, and in  this
    case there would be no recourse to additional public funds by reason of
    the Claimant's presence in the UK.

17. In relation to savings it was  accepted  these  did  not  make  up  the
    shortfall in its entirety, but I was asked to take  into  account  that
    the Claimant had a genuine offer of employment that would be  available
    when she arrived in this country.

18. I was therefore asked to allow the appeal under the Immigration  Rules,
    primarily because the child benefit and child tax credit that would  be
    payable because the couple have a British child, makes up  and  exceeds
    the shortfall in weekly income.

19. As an alternative, if the appeal was not allowed under the  Immigration
    Rules, I was asked to find that compelling circumstances existed  which
    justified allowing the appeal under Article 8 outside the rules, and  I
    was referred to a letter from CH Medical dated 23rd  March  2015  which
    confirmed that the Sponsor has a diagnosis of depression,  fibromyaigia
    and type 1 diabetes, and that he suffers with neuropathic pain  in  his
    legs, low self-confidence and motivation.  The letter states  that  the
    Sponsor's medical condition "will be better addressed with the presence
    of his wife and child present", which would have a positive  impact  on
    his physical and mental health.

20. Mr Hussain confirmed that there would be no need to consider Article 8,
    if the Claimant's appeal was allowed under the Immigration Rules.

21. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

22. Because this is an appeal against refusal of entry clearance, by virtue
    of sections 85 and 85A of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
    2002, I may consider only the circumstances appertaining at the time of
    the decision to refuse entry clearance, which was 27th May 2014.

23. In relation to the Immigration Rules, the burden of  proof  is  on  the
    Claimant, and the standard of proof is a balance of probabilities.

24. The issue to be  decided  is  whether  the  Claimant  has  proved  that
    adequate maintenance is available in the UK, without recourse to public
    funds.  In considering  adequacy  of  maintenance  I  have  taken  into
    account KA and Others (Adequacy of maintenance) Pakistan  [2006]  UKAIT
    00065, in which it was  found  that  the  requirement  of  adequacy  is
    objective, and the level of income and other  benefits  that  would  be
    available if  the  family  were  drawing  income  support  remains  the
    yardstick.

25. I have also considered the principles set out  in  Ahmed  and  set  out
    below paragraph 10 of that decision;

         10.  The authorities concerning adequacy of resources were recently
             reviewed by the Upper Tribunal in Yarce (adequate maintenance:
             benefits) [2012] UKUT 00425 (IAC).  The  correct  approach  is
             that set out  in  KA  and  Others  (Adequacy  of  maintenance)
             Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065, referring to the earlier decision
             in Uvovo (00TH01450), namely:
                  "The appropriate method  of  calculation  for  comparative
                  purposes  is,  as  explained   in   Uvovo,   to   separate
                  maintenance from accommodation, and to look first  to  see
                  whether the accommodation would be adequate, and  then  to
                  see whether the income available  to  the  Appellants  for
                  maintenance is equivalent to  the  amount  that  would  be
                  available to a similar family on income support once  they
                  have dealt with the costs of their accommodation."
             What the Tribunal in Uvovo - and the Tribunal in KA -  seeks
             here to require focus on (and what paras  6A-C  require  focus
             on) is the actual financial position on arrival,  i.e.  income
             that is or will be available to the applicant and his  Sponsor
             upon his arrival in the UK (in the language of para 6,  "as  a
             result of [the applicant's] presence in the UK").  Because the
             calculation is therefore a  projection  forward  to  what  the
             income of the applicant and his  Sponsor  is  or  will  be  on
             arrival, we shall employ the expression "projected income".

26. It is common ground between the parties that the Sponsor's income, when
    compared with what an equivalent family of two  adults  and  one  child
    would receive by way of benefits, discloses a shortfall of  �22.62  per
    week.  I do not find that the Claimant's position is  assisted  by  the
    savings referred to in the calculations contained at pages 1 and  2  of
    the Claimant's latest bundle.  This shows that at the date of  refusal,
    27th  May  2014,  the  savings  available  amounted  to  �497.38.   The
    principle in Jahangara Begum is set out  in  the  head  note  which  is
    reproduced below;

         Where the likely income of  a  family  falls  below  the  level  of
         adequacy as established in the case of KA and Others  (Adequacy  of
         maintenance) Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065 the shortfall can  be  met
         where  there  are  sufficient  savings.   The  assessment  of   the
         appropriate level of savings is not an  arbitrary  calculation  and
         the proper reference is to the length of the initial visa.   If  an
         Appellant is able to meet the  requirements  of  adequacy  for  the
         period of the initial visa, and there is no reason to believe  that
         he will not be able to meet the  maintenance  requirements  in  the
         longer term, then he is entitled to entry clearance.

27. In this case  the  initial  visa  would  be  for  30  months,  and  the
    calculations prepared by Mr Hussain show that  the  Claimant's  savings
    would therefore provide �16.57 per month, which would not make  up  the
    shortfall of �22.62 per week.

28. I therefore turn to consideration of the child benefit  and  the  child
    tax credit that would be payable if the Claimant's British  child  came
    to this country.  The figures contained in the Claimant's  calculations
    have not been disputed by the ECO, although I find that the rates  used
    are the current rates, rather than the rates applicable at the date  of
    refusal and have therefore been very slightly inflated.   This  however
    is not material as even if the benefit rates in force at  the  date  of
    refusal had been used, it is evident that the  Sponsor's  income  would
    exceed the �195.77 per week received by a family in receipt of benefit.
     At the current rates, the Sponsor would be entitled to receive  �84.64
    per week by way of child benefit and child tax credit  in  relation  to
    the British child.  If this could be taken into account, the  Sponsor's
    income would be �257.79 per week.

29. The position of the ECO is that child  benefit  and  child  tax  credit
    cannot be taken into account because it was not received at the date of
    refusal.   I  do  not  accept  that  submission.    The   circumstances
    appertaining at the date of refusal were that the Claimant and  Sponsor
    had a British child.  In my view Ahmed makes it clear that  focus  must
    be on the  actual  financial  position  on  arrival,  as  explained  in
    paragraph 10 of that decision.  As explained in the first paragraph  to
    the head note of Ahmed, what should be taken into account  is  combined
    projected income of an applicant and Sponsor, and there is reference in
    the third paragraph to the head note  to  the  need  to  establish  the
    benefits which a Sponsor and applicant will actually  be  receiving  on
    the applicant's arrival.  The reason for this is explained in paragraph
    10 of Ahmed which has been set out above.

30. I therefore conclude that in assessing adequacy of maintenance under E-
    ECP.3.3(b) the child benefit and child tax credit that would be paid to
    the Sponsor if the British child is  in  the  UK,  can  be  taken  into
    account when assessing adequacy of maintenance.  That  means  that  the
    Sponsor's income exceeds the �195.77 that  would  be  received  by  two
    adults and a child by way of benefits, and it means  that  adequacy  of
    maintenance is available for the Claimant.

31. I have also taken into account  paragraphs  6A-6C  of  the  Immigration
    Rules and conclude that there would be no recourse to additional public
    funds because of the Claimant's presence in the UK.  Public funds  that
    would be payable by way of child benefit and child tax credit, would be
    paid to the Sponsor because of  the  presence  of  his  British  child.
    Those funds would not be paid by reason of the Claimant's  presence  in
    the UK.  The British child would be entitled to enter  the  UK  without
    restriction because of his British citizenship, and could if  necessary
    enter the UK without the Claimant.

32. I therefore reach the conclusion, that the Claimant has discharged  the
    burden of proof, and adequate maintenance is available,  and  therefore
    the Claimant's appeal is  allowed  under  the  Immigration  Rules.   As
    conceded by Mr Hussain, it is therefore not  necessary  to  go  on  and
    consider Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and  was
set aside.  I substitute a fresh decision.

The Claimant's appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction.  There  was  no
request made to the Upper Tribunal for anonymity, and I see no need to  make
an anonymity order.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As the Claimant's appeal has been allowed I have considered whether to  make
a fee award.  In my view the appeal has been  allowed  because  of  evidence
placed before the  Tribunal  which  was  not  placed  before  the  ECO,  and
therefore it is not appropriate to make a fee award.
