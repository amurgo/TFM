                    DETERMINATION AND REASONS FOR FINDING
                           A MATERIAL ERROR OF LAW

Introduction

1.   The appellant is a citizen of India.  She appeals against the  decision
    of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (FTT)  to  uphold  the  decision  of  the
    respondent to refuse her application for leave to remain as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Migrant.

2.   The background to this application  is  that  the  appellant  made  her
    application for leave to remain on 28 August 2013.  Her application was
    considered by the respondent on 10 December 2013  and  was  refused  by
    reason of the fact that  the  respondent  did  not  consider  that  the
    appellant met the requirements of the points-based scheme  in  relation
    to the requirement to show living costs of �1,600 for a consecutive  28
    day period.  The application was specifically refused on the  basis  of
    paragraph 322(1A) of the Immigration Rules in that  the  appellant  had
    produced proof of her finances in the form of a bank statement with the
    reference  number  ...2888  with  ICICI   Bank.    As   a   result   of
    investigations carried out by the respondent it  was  ascertained  that
    this document was false.  Accordingly, the appellant had used deception
    in her application which fell to be refused under that paragraph.   Any
    future applications would be refused under paragraph 320(7B).

The Appeal Proceedings

3.   The  appellant  appealed  that  decision  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    because she said the decision was against the weight of  the  evidence,
    the respondent had not raised any query with  the  appellant  over  the
    authenticity of the documents supplied and clearly, therefore, she  had
    not  investigated  the  matter  thoroughly  "on  fair  and   reasonably
    standards".   Furthermore,  the  appellant  ought  to   have   had   an
    opportunity  to  respond  to  the  respondent's  concerns.    Had   the
    respondent made enquiries of the appellant she would  have  provided  a
    "valid explanation to issue raised by  the  respondent".   Furthermore,
    the respondent had not acted  in  compliance  with  the  principles  of
    fairness and the reader is referred to the case  of  Thakur.   Finally,
    the appellant claimed to have established rights under Article 8 of the
    European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in the UK.  In her notice of
    appeal, dated 30 December 2013, the appellant ticked the box indicating
    that she wished to have an oral hearing of her appeal.  Accordingly,  a
    notice a hearing was sent out  to  the  appellant,  who  at  that  time
    appears to have been unrepresented, indicating that her appeal would be
    heard on 5 August 2014 at Hatton Cross.  That notice was  issued  on  5
    February 2014.  However, by 10 March 2014 the appellant had  instructed
    Hafiz and  Haque,  Solicitors,  to  act  on  her  behalf.   They  wrote
    requesting that the appeal be dealt with  on  the  papers  enclosing  a
    witness statement dated 5 February 2014.  The statement says  that  the
    allegation  that  the  appellant  had  produced  false   documents/used
    deception was a serious matter that required her to  raise  an  enquiry
    with the appellant.  He she done so the appellant would have been  able
    to address the matter.  It was "abundantly evident" from  the  evidence
    which existed at the date of the application  that  the  appellant  had
    "sufficient  funds  available"  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules and the relevant policy.  New  directions  were  sent
    out on 20 March 2014 requiring  the  appellant  to  serve  any  written
    evidence and submissions by 7 April 2014.  In fact  the  appellant  did
    not submit any new evidence.

4.   The appeal to the First-tier Tribunal  came  before  Immigration  Judge
    Boyd on 6 May  2014.   Judge  Boyd  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal
    because, although the required points were awarded for Confirmation  of
    Acceptance for Studies, no points fell to be  awarded  for  maintenance
    and funds on the basis that the bank statement used as proof of finance
    was found to be false.  The Immigration Judge referred  to  a  document
    verification report (DVR) which had been supplied indicating that on 18
    November 2013 ICICI Bank had confirmed the bank statement supplied  was
    false.  The appellant was therefore unable to establish  that  she  had
    the required �1,600 for the consecutive 28 day period required and  the
    respondent had correctly refused the application under the points-based
    scheme.  The Immigration Judge also considered Article 8 but  found  it
    not to be engaged on the facts.  Accordingly, he dismissed the  appeals
    on both bases.

Proceedings before the Upper Tribunal

5.   On 14 May 2014 the appellant appealed the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal because, she claimed, she had been informed  by  the  relevant
    bank that no such  enquiry  had  been  made  by  the  respondent.   The
    appellant had not been aware of the  DVR  except  for  the  allegations
    raised in the refusal letter.  The  appellant  had  not  been  given  a
    proper opportunity to respond to the allegations.  The requirements  of
    procedural  unfairness  had  not  been  satisfied.   Furthermore,   the
    appellant claimed that it was  for  the  respondent  decision-maker  to
    establish any  contested  facts  and  the  documents  produced  by  the
    appellant should  be  assumed  to  be  genuine  unless  and  until  the
    respondent proved to the contrary.

6.   On 6 June 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth  considered  that
    the grounds raised an arguable issue on the basis that  the  conclusion
    at paragraph 10 of the determination that the appellant had  failed  to
    answer the document verification report appeared to be unsustainable in
    the light of a failure to apply the proper burden and standard of proof
    which rested on the respondent.

7.   Standard directions were sent out indicating  that  the  parties  would
    not be able to rely on new evidence not before the First-tier  Tribunal
    unless they made the appropriate application.

8.   On 26 June 2014 the respondent responded under Rule 24 to say that  she
    was unable to verify that the DVR had been served  in  advance  of  the
    hearing  and  therefore  was  unable  to  refute  the  suggestion   the
    procedural unfairness allegation.

9.   An oral hearing was fixed for 1 August 2014 at 10.00am.   Both  parties
    were represented at the hearing.

The Hearing before the Upper Tribunal

10.  The respondent explained that the only issue in the appeal  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal was the issue of maintenance and in particular  the
    questionable bank statement from the ICICI Bank.  It  was  accepted  by
    the respondent that the Immigration Judge had not mentioned the  burden
    and standard of proof, although his decision could be  read  as  having
    incorporated an analysis (in paragraphs  8  and  9)  which  effectively
    considered the burden and standard or proof correctly.

11.  Mr Khan on behalf of the appellant submitted that his client had  never
    been served with the DVR so that the Tribunal could  not  be  satisfied
    that the requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  had  been  properly
    considered. In particular  the  burden  rested  on  the  respondent  to
    produce evidence to sustain the allegation, relying  on  paragraph  322
    (1A)  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  that  a  false  document  had  been
    submitted.

12.  The respondent emphasised that the substance of  the  refusal  included
    reference to the questioned bank statement and the DVR.

13.  The appellant then said that there was an issue as to when  the  bundle
    had been  served.   It  was  unsafe  to  place  reliance  on  telephone
    conversations between unknown individuals.  The Tribunal was invited to
    allow the appeal especially since no  issue  had  been  raised  in  the
    refusal letter with regard to the DVR.  That report was, in any  event,
    said to be unreliable.

14.  At  approximately  this  point  in  the  proceedings  Mr  Whitwell  was
    informed that he was needed on the telephone.   I  therefore  adjourned
    proceedings  for  approximately  half  an  hour   for   him   to   take
    instructions.  When I returned I was presented with a fax containing  a
    letter written by an S Gayle, a senior caseworker on behalf of the Home
    Office.  By her letter dated 12 May 2014  directed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, which was faxed to the Upper Tribunal on  1  August  2014  at
    10.56am, she notified the Tribunal of the  existence  of  the  DVR  and
    explained that she had not been notified of the  change  from  an  oral
    hearing (originally listed for 5 August 2014) to a paper  determination
    on 6 May 2014.   That  explained  the  absence  of  the  DVR  from  the
    documents produced to the appellant before the First-tier Tribunal.

15.  Earlier in the proceedings I had asked  Mr  Khan  to  set  out  to  the
    Tribunal what course of action he invited me to take in the event  that
    I found a material error of law  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Mr Khan invited me to remake the decision.  I called on  him
    to address me about the facts referred to in  the  previous  paragraph.
    He said that I should not allow the new evidence to be  adduced  having
    regard to its late service.  Furthermore, the DVR could not be shown to
    be reliable even if it is admitted.  Finally, Mr  Khan  said  that  the
    document produced did not contain a statement of truth.

16.  At the end of the hearing I decided that there was a material error  of
    law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal in the manner  in  which
    the allegedly false document had been dealt with.  In  particular,  the
    burden rested on the respondent to show that the  document  was  false,
    albeit to the civil standard of proof.  There was a lack of analysis in
    the Immigration Judge's  determination.  A  clear  explanation  of  the
    burden and standard of proof in relation to this important document was
    required.  There was also a potential procedural irregularity  in  that
    at the point the Immigration Judge decided to place reliance on the DVR
    it could not be shown to have been served on the appellant.  For  those
    reasons, but principally because of the  lack  of  clear  reasoning  in
    relation to the burden and standard of proof, I  decided  to  set-aside
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal. I will now proceed to  re-make
    the decision.

Discussion

17.  The burden rests on  the  claimant  to  show  that  she  satisfies  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and specifically paragraph 245 ZX
    of those rules.  It is accepted on behalf of the respondent  that,  but
    for the questioned document, she would satisfy those requirements.

18.  The burden of showing that the requirements of paragraph 322  (1A)  are
    met rests on the respondent. The  burden  may  only  be  discharged  by
    producing cogent evidence that the document the appellant seeks to rely
    upon in support of her claim that she meets  the  requirements  of  the
    points-based scheme is a forgery.  This  question  is  decided  to  the
    ordinary civil standard of  proof  but  because  the  allegation  is  a
    serious one the evidence must be at least cogent and clear.

19.  The substance  of  the  refusal  by  the  ECO  was  that  the  "issuing
    authority" had confirmed to him that the bank statement produced was  a
    forgery.  The DVR considered by the First-tier Tribunal Judge  may  not
    have been served  on  the  appellant  but  the  substance  of  what  is
    contained therein has been with the appellant since at least  the  date
    of the refusal.  The appellant has now been served with the DVR and has
    had an opportunity to consider it but has  chosen  to  put  forward  no
    evidence in response.  I allowed Mr Khan an opportunity  to  request  a
    fresh hearing at which such evidence could be adduced but  he  declined
    that opportunity, requesting that I remake the decision  based  on  the
    evidence already produced.

20.  The evidence produced at the hearing before the Upper Tribunal, in  the
    form of the letter from S Gayle dated 12 May 2014 directed to the First-
    tier Tribunal referred to in paragraph 14 above, is not "new evidence".
     I infer that the letter dated  12  May  2014  was  placed  before  the
    Immigration Judge as he expressly refers to the DVR in paragraph  8  of
    his determination.  Furthermore, S Gayle gives a full  explanation  for
    the failure to obtain the DVR prior to the papers being placed with the
    Immigration Judge.   She  explains  that  she  intended  to  serve  the
    evidence on 9 May 2014 with a view to the hearing  taking  place  on  5
    August 2014 but was informed that the hearing was due to be aborted  in
    favour of a paper determination.  She was unaware of that fact until  9
    May 2014, i.e. after the papers had been placed before the  Immigration
    Judge.  Even if the email dated 2 April 2014 at 08.31, which refers  to
    the  "certificate"  relied  on  by  the  appellant   as   having   been
    "falsified", was not before the First-tier Tribunal  the  substance  of
    the allegation contained in that e mail was.  I do not consider  the  e
    mail to take matters much further than the DVR.  Accordingly,  even  if
    the email did constitute fresh evidence it would not have  led  to  any
    different outcome.

21.  Knowing of the  importance  of  this  issue  and  seeing  the  Rule  24
    response it was open to the appellant to prepare on the  basis  that  a
    fresh hearing would be needed at which she  could  adduce  evidence  in
    rebuttal.  However, she chose not to do  this.   I  find  that  in  the
    absence of any evidence to rebut the apparently  cogent  DVR  the  only
    inference that I can draw is that the appellant did  indeed  provide  a
    false document  to  the  respondent  in  support  of  her  claim.   The
    Immigration Judge commented on the lack of evidence in rebuttal  as  at
    the date of the hearing as at the date of  his  determination  (13  May
    2014).  There is still no such evidence.

22.  In the absence of any such evidence I am satisfied that the  burden  of
    proving that the bank statement submitted in support of the appellant's
    claim is false has been discharged  by  the  respondent.   Accordingly,
    there is no other basis upon which  the  appellant  could  be  said  to
    satisfy the requirements of the  points-based  scheme  and  her  appeal
    against  the  respondent's  refusal  was  correctly  dismissed  by  the
    Immigration Judge albeit after a failure to  consider  the  burden  and
    standard of proof.

My Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material  error  of  law.
Accordingly, that decision is set aside.

I have decided to re-make the decision.

Having  fully  considered  the  evidence  produced  before  the   First-tier
Tribunal including, insofar as necessary,  the  evidence  contained  in  the
letter dated 12 May 2014 by  S Gayle, I have decided to dismiss  the  appeal
against the Secretary of State's decision to refuse  the  appellant  further
leave to remain.
