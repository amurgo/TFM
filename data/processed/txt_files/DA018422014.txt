                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appeal of the Secretary of State but I will  refer  to  the
    original appellant, a citizen of Eritrea born on 11 August 1972, as the
    appellant herein.  He appeals the Secretary of State's decision  on  23
    September 2014 to refuse to revoke a deportation order made on 17 April
    2008.  His appeal was allowed by the First-tier  Tribunal  following  a
    hearing on 23  March  2015  on  Article  8  grounds.   The  appeal  was
    dismissed on asylum, humanitarian protection and Article 3 grounds  and
    there has been no challenge to that aspect of the decision.

2.   The appellant had arrived in this country on  22  September  1990.   An
    application for asylum was refused.  He was granted leave to remain for
    a limited period and was granted  indefinite  leave  to  remain  on  12
    February 2000.  He has a very extensive criminal history.   The  First-
    tier Judge dealt with the appellant's Article 8 case in  the  following
    extract from her determination:

         "27. The  appellant  is  liable  to  deportation  as  a  persistent
             offender who shows a particular disregard for the law (398(c))
             of the Rules.  As has been stated in R (on the application  of
             Akpinar)  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  937  -"Frequent  and   continuing
             repetition of offences  that  were  not  individually  serious
             might  amount  to  serious  offending  which  could    justify
             expulsions".  This is the case here.

         28.  This is aggravated by the fact that since  the  2008  decision
             the appellant has continued to offend as shown in the PNC.  He
             has the following  convictions  -  12/11/08  -  travelling  on
             railway  without  a  train  ticket  (�20  fine),   25/5/09   -
             shoplifting (detention),  16/7/09  -  breach  ASBO  (Community
             Order and 12 months supervision  and  6  months  DRO),  14/8/9
             possession of crack cocaine (�100 or 1 day), 8/6/10 possession
             of article for use in fraud (3 months imprisonment),  11/10/10
             assault on a  constable  (suspended  4  months  imprisonment),
             offer to supply cannabis (4 month  prison  consecutively)  and
             supply Class B drug (3 months suspended imprisonment and  DRO)
             13/8/13  supply  of  crack  cocaine   (16   months   suspended
             imprisonment and DRO and ASBO 5 years),  11/12/14  shoplifting
             (�80 fine), 15/1/05 travelling on  a  railway  without  paying
             (�400 fine).  He has a further  conviction  for  stealing  two
             sandwiches from Pret  a  Manger  on  21  November  2014.   His
             evidence was that he was hungry and had run out for money.  He
             has trouble managing his finances. He regularly collects  food
             from Pret, which is given away at the  end  of  the  day.   He
             sometimes does so in bulk to share with  fellow  residents  at
             his hostel.

         29.  The appellant does not meet the requirements in the Rules  for
             family life  (A362  and  399  -  relationship  with  child  or
             partner) or for private life (399A) for reasons stated by  the
             respondent such that the public interest  in  his  deportation
             is outweighed by reason of his family and  private  life.   He
             has not been lawfully (emphasis added)  resident in the UK for
             most  of  his  life,   his   lawful   residence   amounts   to
             approximately 17 of his 43 years and in the respondent's  view
             he is not socially and culturally integrated  in  the  UK  and
             there would be very significant obstacles to  his  integration
             into Eritrea.

         30.  The Rules provides that in  those  circumstances  'the  public
             interest in deportation will only be outweighed  in  by  other
             factors where there are very compelling circumstances over and
             above  those  described  in  paragraphs  399  and  399A'.   In
             assessing this issue I have taken  into  account  AJ  (Angola)
             [2014] EWCA Civ 1636 and MA (Somalia) [2015] EWCA Civ 48, that
             the  Rules  are  a  complete  code  in  deportation  and   any
             assessment of proportionality (including under Article 8 ECHR)
             and the public interest must  be  seen  through  the  lens  of
             Parliament's determination of where the public  interest  lies
             and that considerable weight is to  be  given  to  the  public
             interest in deporting foreign criminals who do not satisfy the
             Rules.  It is only exceptionally that such  foreign  criminals
             would succeed in showing that their Article 8  rights  trumped
             the public interest in deportation - SS (Nigeria) [2013]  EWCA
             Civ 550 and Richards [2013] EWCA Civ 244. I  have  also  taken
             into account that the appellant is a  settled  migrant  as  in
             Maslov-MA (Somalia) and 'very serious reasons' are required to
             justify expulsion again in the framework of  the  new  Rules'.
             In  addition,  I  bore  in  mind  that  the  public   interest
             requirements in the 2012  Act  are  not  'exhaustive'  -  Dube
             (ss117A-117D) [2015] UKUT 00090 (IAC).

         31.  The appellant has been found to be liable for deportation as a
             persistent offender. Mr Alagh noted that the appellant has  19
             convictions for 30 offences, began offending when  he  was  29
             years old and is now 43 years old. Parliament has deemed it in
             the public interest to deport him because he has shown  little
             regard for the laws. Mr Bazani  noted  with  some  force  that
             those sentencing  him  did  not  believe  that  prison  was  a
             suitable tool for dealing with the  offending  because  he  is
             suffering from addiction. He referred not the need  to  assess
             the  criminality   in   issue   -   McLarty   (Deportation   -
             proportionality balance) [2014] UKUT 315 (IAC).

         32.  The appellant has been sentenced in total to  3  years  and  5
             months in prison of which he has spent approximately only  one
             and half years there. This is not to minimise the  extent  and
             proliferation of his criminality but it is at the lower end of
             the scale. The appellant has not been in prison for  the  past
             10 years. The PNC appeared to incorrectly state  he  was  last
             there in 2005.  There was not a judge's sentencing remarks  or
             a probation report before me.  In my view there is a very  low
             risk of reoffending if the appellant's underlying problems are
             treated. The evidence was that the depression is being tackled
             for the first time and he is making 'remarkable progress'.  He
             has not relapsed into illicit drugs since 2013.

         33.  The appellant presented as a gentle and  sensitive  person  as
             described in his brother's witness statement. This is  not  to
             detract from the fact that he has committed  offences  against
             the person in the past due to his addiction.  The  appellant's
             addiction is an illness. The appellant has  a  strong  private
             life in the UK that would be seriously interfered with  if  he
             is returned to Eritrea. He is, though 43 years old,  close  to
             his family.  They are  very  supportive  of  him.   They  have
             attended all his hearings and put up surety for his bail. They
             see him every weekend. I have no doubt that  there  is  family
             life (as indeed found by the previous Tribunals) between  them
             for the purposes of Article 8 because he  is  financially  and
             emotionally dependent on them beyond one would expect  to  see
             between adult siblings.  Family life between adult siblings as
             such is not recognised in the  Rules  though  it  is  arguably
             falls under private life.  His private life appears to consist
             mainly of his family in the UK.

         34.  The issue of whether the appellant is socially and  culturally
             integrated into life in the UK is difficult. The appellant has
             spent more than half his life in the UK. He speaks his  native
             language, Tigrinian and  English.  He  gave  his  evidence  in
             English. He presented as a solitary and introspective  person.
             He lacks the ability to function socially.  He  has  not  been
             able to form strong personal friendships.  He does not have  a
             girlfriend and has never married. He spent only  10  years  of
             his  life  in  Eritrea  and  8  years  in  Ethiopia.  He   has
             difficulties integrating. He has his close family  here.  They
             have been able to integrate because  they  were  young  enough
             when they arrived to have the benefit of education in the  UK.
             He and his older brother appear to  have  fallen  outside  the
             safety  net.   His  siblings  have  made  good  use  of  their
             opportunities and have responsible jobs and contribute to  the
             economic wellbeing of the country while he has not  been  able
             to maintain a job. He  is  dependent  on  public  funds  -  he
             receives ESA and lives rent free in a  hostel  (s117B  of  the
             2002 Act), but it must not be overlooked  that  he  has  lived
             lawfully here for 17 out of 25 years in the UK.

         35.  It is notable that S117C provides  that  a  foreign  (emphasis
             added) criminal who has been sentenced to a period of at least
             four years imprisonment requires deportation unless there  are
             very  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above   those   in
             Exceptions 1 and 2.  This appellant is not a foreign  criminal
             or been sentenced to four years or more.

         36.  The appellant is able to live independently  in  the  UK  only
             because of the support of his siblings and the  treatment  for
             his illness and for accommodation provided by the  State  (NHS
             etc).  In my view looked at in the round and on balance  there
             would be very significant  obstacles  to  his  integrating  in
             Eritrea even if he has family there (whom he has not seen  for
             25 years).  The way of life would be almost alien to him.  The
             combination of the length of his  residence  in  the  UK,  the
             dependency on  his  family  and  his  mental  health  and  his
             addiction show in my view that his right to physical and moral
             integrity would be breached if he is returned to Eritrea -  MM
             (Zimbabwe) [2012] EWCA Civ 279 approved in GS  (India)  [2015]
             above.  In  my  view  it  is  not  necessary  to  deport  this
             appellant where with the support of  his  family  and  medical
             treatment there is little risk that he will reoffend.   I find
             that the strong public interest in deportation  is  outweighed
             by the exceptional circumstances in his case.

         37.   I  would  come  to  the  same  conclusion  in  assessing  the
             proportionality of the decision under Article 8 ECHR  which  I
             would have looked at through  the  lens  of  the  Rules  -  MA
             (Somalia) [2015] above.  I would find  that  the  respondent's
             decision is 'a more  drastic  interference  with  the  primary
             Convention right than is necessary for public safety  and  the
             prevention of  crime  and  disorder'  -  Huang  when  balanced
             against this appellant's circumstances and rights and those of
             his family."

3.   The judge, as I have said, allowed the appeal under Article 8 only.

4.   The Secretary of State appealed.  Permission to appeal was  refused  by
    the First-tier Tribunal but was granted in a decision dated 3 June 2015
    by Upper Tribunal Judge Coker.

5.   Miss Brocklesby-Weller relied on the two sets of grounds that had  been
    filed.  The appellant had not met the requirements  of  the  Rules  and
    very compelling reasons were required to  outweigh  the  strong  public
    interest in deportation - I was referred to paragraph 46 of AJ (Angola)
    [2014] EWCA Civ 1636.  I was also  referred  to  the  case  of  McLarty
    [2014] UKUT  00315  (IAC)  and  in  particular  the  third  and  fourth
    paragraphs of the head note which read as follows:

         "(3) Where the facts surrounding an individual who has committed  a
         crime are said to  be  'exceptional'  or  'compelling',  these  are
         factors to be placed in the weighing scale, in order to be  weighed
         against the public interest.

         (4)   In  some  other  instances,  the  phrase   'exceptional'   or
         'compelling' has been used to describe the end result: namely, that
         the position of the individual  is  'exceptional'  or  'compelling'
         because, having weighed the unusual facts  against  the  (powerful)
         public interest, the former outweighs the latter.   In  this  sense
         'exceptional'  or  'compelling'  is   the   end   result   of   the
         proportionality weighing process."

6.   The judge had failed properly to address the  public  interest  in  the
    light of this guidance.  I was also referred to Chege [2015] UKUT 00165
    (IAC) and the need to identify very compelling  circumstances  informed
    by the seriousness of the  criminality  and  taking  into  account  the
    factors set out in Section 117B.  However, the judge had concluded that
    the appellant was not a foreign criminal in paragraph  35  and  it  was
    clear that she had erred in so concluding. She did not appear  to  have
    accepted that the appellant was  socially  and  culturally  integrated.
    The judge had referred to Maslov but the appellant's circumstances were
    distinguishable as  he  had  arrived  aged  18  and  was  a  persistent
    offender.

7.   I was referred by Ms Igbal to paragraph 46 of AJ (Angola) where  Maslov
    was a matter to be brought into the overall assessment and there was  a
    need to demonstrate very compelling  circumstances.   She  referred  in
    particular to the last sentence of paragraph 46 and  distinguished  the
    applicant's circumstances as found by the judge.  The judge  had  taken
    into account the length of residence and the fact  that  the  appellant
    although imprisoned in the past had been  making  remarkable  progress.
    The findings in paragraph 33 had not been challenged.  What was said in
    paragraph 35 was possibly a slip. Although the appellant  had  not  met
    the Article 3 threshold, his mental health and addiction were  still  a
    relevant factor in the balancing act.

8.   At the conclusion of the hearing I  reserved  my  decision.   I  remind
    myself that I can only interfere with the decision if it was materially
    flawed in law.

9.   The  appellant,  as  is  clear  from  paragraph  28  of  the  decision,
    continued with his offending behaviour after the decision to deport him
    in 2008.  Although as the judge said in paragraph 32, he had  not  been
    in prison for the past ten years, he had been sentenced to imprisonment
    on some five occasions, albeit the sentences were suspended.  The judge
    noted that the appellant had not been lawfully resident in the  UK  and
    in paragraph 34 does not appear to conclude that he  was  socially  and
    culturally integrated.

10.  In  paragraph  35  of  the  determination  the  judge  finds  that  the
    appellant is not a foreign criminal and the respondent takes the  point
    that in that respect the judge erred because  under  Section  117D  the
    appellant had been accepted (in paragraph 27 of the  determination)  to
    be a persistent offender and was therefore a foreign criminal.  In such
    circumstances the appellant would need  to  bring  himself  within  the
    exceptions set out at 117C(4):

         (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most of
         C's life,

         (b)  C is socially and culturally integrated in the United Kingdom,
         and

         (c)  there would be very significant obstacles to  C's  integration
         into the country to which C is proposed to be deported.

    The three requirements referred to in the statute and at paragraph 399A
    were not all met on the judge's findings.  She appears to have found in
    the  appellant's  favour  in  relation  to  significant  obstacles   to
    integration  but  made  no  clear  findings  on  social  and   cultural
    integration and appears to have accepted  the  respondent's  contention
    that the appellant had not been lawfully resident in the UK for most of
    his life.

11.  In addition, the circumstances of the appellant's case are not  similar
    to the circumstances in Maslov as argued by the respondent and what  is
    said in Maslov needs to be read in the  light  of  what  the  Court  of
    Appeal said in Akpinar to which the judge  refers  in  another  context
    paragraph 27 of her determination.

12.  I find that  the  respondent's  arguments  sufficiently  demonstrate  a
    material error of law on the part of the  First-tier  Judge.  Ms  Iqbal
    argues that what the judge said in paragraph 35 might have been a  slip
    but on the face of it is a serious misdirection. It  is  one  thing  to
    fail to refer to s 117 considerations if it is  clear  they  have  been
    applied (see Dube) but it is quite another to say  they  do  not  apply
    when they do: see the third paragraph of the  headnote  in  Forman  (ss
    117A-C considerations) [2015] UKUT 00412 (IAC):  "In  cases  where  the
    provisions of sections 117B-117C of the 2002 Act arise, the decision of
    the Tribunal must demonstrate that they have been given  full  effect."
    In defence of the judge I would acknowledge that at the  start  of  the
    proceedings she refers to  Counsel  (not  Ms  Iqbal)  not  providing  a
    skeleton argument and handing a bundle of cases with little attempt  to
    explain their significance or relevance. This  would  render  her  task
    more difficult than it already was.  Having said that, I am  unable  to
    find that this determination  is  salvageable.   I  have  come  to  the
    conclusion, bearing in mind the Senior President's Practice Statements,
    that the appeal must be reheard before the First-tier Tribunal so  that
    the factual issues relevant to Article  8  can  be  determined  in  the
    correct context.  There has been no challenge to the  judge's  decision
    in respect of the asylum, humanitarian protection or Article 3 grounds.

    The determination is flawed by a material error of law.  Accordingly  I
    set aside the decision and remit the  appeal  to  be  heard  afresh  on
    Article 8 grounds before a different First-tier Judge.

    Anonymity Direction
