For the Respondent:    M K Suri & Co, Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State.  Nonetheless, hereinafter, I shall refer to the parties as  they
    were described before the First-tier Tribunal that is Mr Feroze as  the
    appellant and the Secretary of State as the Respondent.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan  born  on  1  January  1972  and
    applied on 3 January 2014 for further leave to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom as the spouse of Amreen Akhtar.  That application  was  refused
    by the Secretary of State on 14 August 2014  further  to  paragraph  R-
    LTRP.1.1 on the basis that the appellant either had to meet all of  the
    requirements of Section E-LTRP or alternatively meet  the  requirements
    of paragraph  E-LTRP1.2  to  1.12  and  E-LTRP2.1  and  paragraph  EX.1
    applied.

 3. Further to E-LTRP3.1 the applicant must provide specified evidence from
    the sources listed in paragraph E-LTRP3.2 of:-

          a) a specified gross annual income of at least:

             (i)  �18,600 ...

 4. The appellant's application was refused because he  did  not  meet  the
    income threshold requirements with reference to Appendix FM-SE.

 5. In particular he had failed to provide the specified  documentation  to
    evidence his spouse had an annual income at �18,600 prior to  the  date
    of application which was 3rd January 2014.  He had  failed  to  provide
    wage slips and bank statements stating the six months prior to the date
    of  his  application  as  his  spouse  commenced  her  employment  with
    Croscontinent Ltd on  1  October  2013.   He  also  failed  to  provide
    documentation to demonstrate the spouse had an annual income of �18,600
    in the twelve months prior to the date of application.

 6. Consideration was given to EX.1 that he had not  submitted  that  there
    were  very  significant  difficulties  which  would  be  faced  by  the
    applicant or his partner in continuing family life together outside the
    UK as determined by EX.2.  His application was therefore refused  under
    Appendix FM.

 7. Further consideration was given to  paragraph  276ADE  but  once  again
    further to paragraph 276ADE(6) it had not been demonstrated that  there
    would be very significant obstacles to his integration into the country
    to which he would have to go if he had to leave the UK.

 8.  His  application  was  not  considered  to   raise   any   exceptional
    circumstances.  The appellant appealed.

 9. First-tier Tribunal Judge Blum heard the appeal on 24  April  2015  and
    allowed the appeal on 12 May 2015.

10. An application for permission to appeal set out that as the sponsor had
    been employed for less than six months at the date of  the  application
    the sponsor must (i) have been earning at least �18,600 and  (ii)  have
    earned the threshold income in the past twelve months.   In  this  case
    there is no evidence of the sponsor's earnings prior to  October  2013.
    The application was made in January 2013  and  the  sponsor  must  show
    their earnings for the previous twelve months and there was no evidence
    of earnings prior to October 2013. The judge failed to have  regard  to
    Appendix FM-SE Section 13(b).

11.  Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge
    Hollingsworth.

Conclusions

12. Judge Blum found there was a narrow issue for him to consider and noted
    at paragraph 15 of his decision that the appellant's  partner  had  not
    been employed  by  the  current  employer  for  at  least  six  months.
    According to paragraph 2(a) of Appendix FM-SE  the  paragraph  required
    "either six months' worth of payslips 'if the person has been  employed
    by their current employer for six months'."  He noted that the  sponsor
    had earlier been employed by GB Properties.   She  commenced  full-time
    employment on 1 October 2013 with Croscontinent.  The partner's  annual
    salary based on her full-time employment which commenced on  1  October
    2013 was �24,960.

13. The judge stated at paragraph 16:-

         "16. As the partner had not been employed in the same  capacity  by
             Croscontinental Ltd before 01/10/2013  the  respondent  should
             then have proceeded to consider paragraph 2(ii) of Appendix FM-
             SE, which indicated that account  was  to  be  taken  of  'any
             period of salaried employment in the period of 12 months prior
             to the date of application if the person has been employed  by
             their current employer for less than 6 months ...'.   A  clear
             reading  of  this  paragraph  does  not  require  evidence  of
             employment stretching over 12 months, but merely  evidence  of
             the salaried employment that was  undertaken  by  the  partner
             within the 12 month period prior to the date  of  application.
             As the partner in the present appeal has  been  employed  from
             01/10/2013 regard should have been given  to  that  period  of
             employment up to the date of the application,  in  conjunction
             with the wage slips produced covering that period and the bank
             account statements covering the same period showing the salary
             paid into the  bank  account.   The  appellant's  partner  had
             produced a letter from her employer providing all the  details
             required by Appendix FM-SE (no issue was raised in  regard  to
             the letter by the  respondent),  wage  slips  in  the  correct
             format covering her employment from 01/10/2013 to the date  of
             the application, which was consistent with her  claimed  gross
             income, and the corresponding bank account statements covering
             the same period which clearly showed  the  salary  being  paid
             into the bank  account  belonging  to  the  partner.   In  the
             circumstances I am entirely satisfied that the  appellant  met
             the requirements of Appendix FM  and  Appendix  FM-SE  on  the
             basis of the circumstances as they existed at the date of  the
             application.  The more recent bank  account  statements,  wage
             slips and employers letter  strongly  reinforces  my  view  in
             respect of the evidence adduced by the partner in  respect  of
             her employment prior to the date of the application."

14. The Rule in question reads as follows:-

         "2.  In respect of salaried employment  in  the  UK  (except  where
             paragraph 9 applies), all of the following  evidence  must  be
             provided:

             (a)  Payslips covering:

                  (i)   a  period  of  six  months  prior  to  the  date  of
                      application if a person has been  employed  by  their
                      current employer for at least six months  (and  where
                      paragraph 13(b) of this Appendix does not apply; or

                  (ii)     any period of salaried employment in  the  period
                      of twelve months prior to the date of application  if
                      the  person  has  been  employed  by  their   current
                      employer for less than six months (or  at  least  six
                      months but the person  does  not  rely  on  paragraph
                      13(a) of this Appendix) or  in  the  financial  years
                      relied on by a self-employed person."

15. The judge did not appear to regard Appendix FM-SE Section  13(b)  which
    sets out this requirement:

         "...

         13(b)    Where the person is in salaried employment in  the  UK  at
                the date of application  and  has  been  employed  by  their
                current employer for less than six months (or at  least  six
                months but the person does not  rely  on  paragraph  13(a)),
                their gross annual income will be the total of:

                (i)    the gross annual salary from employment as it was  at
                    the date of application;

                (ii)   the gross amount  of  any  specified  not  employment
                    income (other than a pension income) received by them or
                    their partner in the twelve months prior to the date  of
                    application); and

                (iii)  the gross annual income from a UK  or  foreign  state
                    pension or private pension received  by  them  or  their
                    partner."

16. Although the sponsor's annual salary from her employment was �24,960 at
    the date of application she had not demonstrated that  she  had  earned
    �18,600 in the twelve months prior to the application.  The  judge  had
    failed to consider the second part of the requirement and erred in law.

17. At the hearing Miss Sreeraman referred to the Immigration Rules as  set
    out in Appendix FM-SE and made particular reference to paragraph  13(b)
    and 15 which the judge had appeared to have overlooked.

18. Miss Suri conceded  that  the  appellant  could  not  comply  with  the
    Immigration  Rules  and  indeed  she  submitted  that  she  made   that
    submission at the hearing but indicated that  her  submissions  at  the
    hearing before Judge Blum rested on the fact that the Home  Office  had
    invited the appellant following the decision  in  MM  (Lebanon)  [2014]
    EWCA 985 to make a further application or submit further  evidence  and
    the appellant chose to submit further evidence because he  feared  that
    any further application would mean  that  he  would  be  refused  under
    Appendix  FM  because  he  could  not  comply  with   the   suitability
    requirements as he would be out of time.  Miss  Sreeraman  pointed  out
    that that would not have been the case because he still had  leeway  of
    28 days under the suitability requirements of Appendix FM.

19. The judge, when he applied Appendix FM-SE, correctly acknowledged  that
    an appellant could submit less than six months' worth of  payslips  but
    failed to acknowledge paragraph 13(b) and paragraph 15 of Appendix  FM.
    In particular at paragraph 15 it states as follows:-

         "15.     In respect of paragraph 13(b)  and  paragraph  13(d),  the
             provisions in this paragraph also apply:

             (a)  In order to evidence the level  of  gross  annual  income
                  required  by  Appendix  FM,  the  person  must  meet   the
                  requirements in paragraph 13(b) or paragraph 13(d)(i);and

             (b)  The person must also  meet  the  level  of  gross  annual
                  income required by Appendix FM on  the  basis  that  their
                  income is the total of:

                  (i)  The gross income from salaried employment  earned  by
                      the person in the 12 months  prior  to  the  date  of
                      application;

                  (ii)     The gross amount of any specified  non-employment
                      income (other than pension income)  received  by  the
                      person or their partner in the 12 months prior to the
                      date of application;

                  (iii)    The gross amount received from a  UK  or  foreign
                      State pension or a private pension by the  person  or
                      their partner in the 12 months prior to the  date  of
                      application; and

                  (iv) The person cannot combine the gross annual income  at
                      paragraph 15(b)(i)-(iii) with  specified  savings  in
                      order to meet the level of income required."

20. I therefore find that the judge made an error of law in his  assessment
    of the evidence.  The judge, however, did not proceed when  he  allowed
    the appeal to consider paragraph EX.1 and EX.2 or  Article  8  both  of
    which were raised in effect by Miss Suri and it  was  agreed  that  the
    matter should be remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  relevant
    finding.

21. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified. I set aside  the
    decision pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007).  Bearing in mind the nature and extent
    of the findings to be made, the matter should be remitted to the First-
    tier Tribunal under section 12(2) (b) (i) of the TCE 2007  and  further
    to 7.2 (b) of the Presidential Practice Statement.
