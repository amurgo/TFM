For the Respondent:    Mr N. Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by OF, a citizen of Portugal born on 19 August  1992,
    against a decision of the Secretary of State dated 28 February 2019  to
    deport him to Portugal pursuant to regulation  27  of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations  2016  ("the  2016  Regulations").
    The Secretary of State's decision, and the reasons for it, are set  out
    in a reasons for refusal letter of the same  date  ("the  RFRL").   The
    essential  issue  for  my  consideration  is  whether  the  appellant's
    deportation to Portugal would be consistent with the  United  Kingdom's
    obligations under the EU Treaties, as set out in the 2016  Regulations.
    He claims to enjoy the highest level  of  protection  from  deportation
    under the 2016 Regulations, namely that  he  may  only  be  removed  on
    "imperative grounds of public security", that he does not  represent  a
    "genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of  the
    fundamental interests of society", and that his  deportation  would  be
    disproportionate, in light of his claimed reformation, and  the  family
    life he enjoys in this country with his  fianc�e,  children  and  step-
    children.

Procedural background

 2. In a decision and reasons promulgated on 8 January 2020, a panel of the
    Upper Tribunal (Mr Justice Goss,  sitting  as  a  Judge  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Stephen Smith) found that a decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge P Hollingworth) allowing the appellant's
    appeal against the Secretary of State's deportation  decision  involved
    the making of an error of law, and set it aside to be  remade  in  this
    tribunal,  with  no  findings  of  fact  preserved.  It  was  in  those
    circumstances that the matter came before me, sitting alone.

 3. The  decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  setting  Judge  Hollingworth's
    decision aside may be found in the Annex to this decision.

Factual background

 4. The appellant claims to have entered the United Kingdom in  July  2004,
    when he was around 11 years old. The  Secretary  of  State  decided  to
    pursue  the  appellant's  deportation  in  light  of  his   conviction,
    following a trial, for robbery  and  the  possession  of  an  offensive
    weapon in a public place, on 15 September 2017 before the  Crown  Court
    at Snaresbrook. For that offence, the appellant was sentenced  to  four
    years' imprisonment. He is still serving that sentence, albeit the non-
    custodial element of it. I will return to the details of the offence in
    more detail shortly, but in summary  the  appellant  was  convicted  of
    having robbed a taxi driver at knifepoint for a small amount of  money.
    I refer to this offence as "the index offence".

 5. The appellant denied responsibility for the offence at  the  time,  and
    maintains  his  denial  before  me,  contending  that  he  was  wrongly
    convicted.  He applied for leave to appeal against  his  conviction  to
    the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division), but leave was refused  by  the
    single judge. He did not seek to renew his  application  for  leave  to
    appeal before the full court.

 6. Given the nature of the findings I will have  to  make  concerning  the
    appellant's integration in the United Kingdom, it is necessary  to  set
    out his offending history at some length.

      a. In March 2009, aged 16, the appellant was convicted  in  the  Youth
         Court of theft, and sentenced to a three month referral order.

      b. In July 2010, the appellant was convicted before the Youth Court of
         battery, and sentenced to  a  youth  rehabilitation  order,  active
         until January 2011, with a supervision  requirement  and  a  curfew
         requirement for four months. The appellant was also made subject to
         a restraining order prohibiting him from engaging in harassment.

      c. In July 2013, at the North  East  London  Magistrates'  Court,  the
         appellant was convicted of possession of a class B controlled  drug
         (cannabis/cannabis resin). The drugs were forfeited and  destroyed,
         and the appellant was fined �73.

      d. In December 2013, before the North East London Magistrates'  Court,
         the appellant was convicted of a single charge of the possession of
         a prohibited weapon (a weapon for the discharge of a noxious liquid
         or gas  etc.)  and  a  single  charge  of  using  a  vehicle  while
         uninsured. He was subject to a 12 month  community  order  with  an
         unpaid work requirement and disqualified from driving.

      e. In July 2014, at the North  East  London  Magistrates'  Court,  the
         appellant was convicted of  failing  to  comply  with  a  community
         order; the original order was  continued,  and  the  appellant  was
         subject to an additional unpaid  work  requirement  consecutive  to
         those previously imposed.

      f. In April 2015, the appellant was convicted before  the  North  East
         London Magistrates' Court of the possession of an offensive  weapon
         in a public place and sentenced to 12 weeks'  imprisonment,  wholly
         suspended for 12 months, and an unpaid work requirement.

      g. In October 2015, before North East London Magistrates'  Court,  the
         appellant was convicted of the possession of a controlled  drug  of
         class B (cannabis/cannabis resin). He was fined �295.

      h. On 22 December 2015, before North East London  Magistrates'  Court,
         the appellant was convicted of the possession of a controlled  drug
         of class B (cannabis/cannabis resin). He was fined �80.

      i. On 27 July  2016,  before  the  Crown  Court  at  Snaresbrook,  the
         appellant pleaded guilty to the possession of a controlled drug  of
         class B (cannabis/cannabis resin). He  was  sentenced  to  7  days'
         imprisonment.

      j. On 15 August 2016, before  the  Crown  Court  at  Snaresbrook,  the
         appellant pleaded guilty to the possession of a controlled drug  of
         class A (cocaine). He was sentenced to seven days' imprisonment.

      k. On 26 August 2016, before the North East London Magistrates' Court,
         the appellant was convicted of a single charge of causing  the  use
         of an uninsured vehicle and a single charge of  using  threatening,
         abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to  cause  fear
         or provocation of violence. For this offence, he was ordered to pay
         total fines of �300, and had his driving licence endorsed.

 7. Although the RFRL rejected the representations made  by  the  appellant
    that he enjoyed  the  right  of  permanent  residence  under  the  2016
    Regulations, Mr Bramble indicated  that  the  Secretary  of  State  now
    accepts that the appellant enjoys the right of permanent residence. She
    respondent does not accept,  however,  the  appellant's  case  that  he
    enjoys protection from removal pursuant  to  the  "imperative  grounds"
    threshold.

Legal framework

 8.  Regulation  3  of  the  2016  Regulations  deals  with  continuity  of
    residence:

         "3.- Continuity of residence

         (1)  This regulation applies for the purpose of calculating periods
         of  continuous  residence  in  the  United  Kingdom   under   these
         Regulations.

         (2)  Continuity of residence is not affected by-

            (a)   periods of absence from the United Kingdom which  do  not
            exceed six months in total in any year;

            (b)   periods of absence from the United Kingdom on  compulsory
            military service; or

            (c)   one absence from the United Kingdom not exceeding  twelve
            months  for  an  important  reason  such   as   pregnancy   and
            childbirth, serious illness, study or vocational training or an
            overseas posting.

         (3)  Continuity of residence is broken when-

            (a)   a person serves a sentence of imprisonment;

            (b)   a deportation or exclusion order is made in relation to a
            person; or

            (c)   a person is removed from the United Kingdom  under  these
            Regulations.

         (4)  Paragraph (3)(a) applies, in principle, to an EEA national who
         has resided in the United Kingdom for at least ten  years,  but  it
         does not apply where the Secretary of State considers that-

            (a)   prior to serving a  sentence  of  imprisonment,  the  EEA
            national had forged integrating links with the United Kingdom;

            (b)   the effect of the sentence of imprisonment was  not  such
            as to break those integrating links; and

            (c)   taking into account an  overall  assessment  of  the  EEA
            national's situation, it would  not  be  appropriate  to  apply
            paragraph (3)(a) to  the  assessment  of  that  EEA  national's
            continuity of residence.

 9.  Central to this appeal is regulation 27 of the 2016 Regulations  which
    provides:

         "27.-     Decisions taken  on  grounds  of  public  policy,  public
         security and public health

         (1)  In  this  regulation,  a  "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
         decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public security  or
         public health.

         (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.

         (3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect  of  a  person
         with a right of permanent residence under regulation 15  except  on
         serious grounds of public policy and public security.

         (4)  A relevant decision may not  be  taken  except  on  imperative
         grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-

            (a)   has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period
            of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision; or

            (b)   is under the age of 18, unless the relevant  decision  is
            in the best interests of the person concerned, as provided  for
            in the Convention on the Rights of the  Child  adopted  by  the
            General Assembly of the United Nations on 20th November 1989.

         (5)  The public policy and  public  security  requirements  of  the
         United Kingdom include restricting rights  otherwise  conferred  by
         these Regulations in order to protect the fundamental interests  of
         society, and where a relevant  decision  is  taken  on  grounds  of
         public  policy  or  public  security  it  must  also  be  taken  in
         accordance with the following principles-

            (a)    the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
            proportionality;

            (b)   the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
            conduct of the person concerned;

            (c)   the personal conduct  of  the  person  must  represent  a
            genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting  one
            of the fundamental interests of society,  taking  into  account
            past conduct of the person and that the threat does not need to
            be imminent;

            (d)   matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
            which relate to considerations of  general  prevention  do  not
            justify the decision;

            (e)   a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
            themselves justify the decision;

            (f)   the decision may be taken on preventative  grounds,  even
            in the absence of a previous criminal conviction, provided  the
            grounds are specific to the person.

         (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on  the  grounds  of  public
         policy and public security in relation to a  person  ("P")  who  is
         resident in the  United  Kingdom,  the  decision  maker  must  take
         account of considerations such as the age, state of health,  family
         and economic situation of P, P's length of residence in the  United
         Kingdom, P's  social  and  cultural  integration  into  the  United
         Kingdom and the extent of P's links with P's country of origin.

         [...]

         (8)  A court or tribunal considering whether  the  requirements  of
         this regulation are met must (in particular)  have  regard  to  the
         considerations contained in Schedule 1  (considerations  of  public
         policy, public security and the fundamental  interests  of  society
         etc.)."

10. The relevant considerations listed in schedule  1  to  the  Regulations
    include paragraph 1 (the EU Treaties do not impose a uniform  scale  of
    values on Member States, who enjoy  "considerable  discretion"  to  set
    their own standards of public policy and security), and the following:

         "(3) Where an EEA national or the family member of an EEA  national
         has received a custodial sentence, or is a persistent offender, the
         longer the sentence, or the  more  numerous  the  convictions,  the
         greater the likelihood that the individual's continued presence  in
         the United Kingdom represents a genuine, present  and  sufficiently
         serious threat affecting of the fundamental interests of society.

         (4)  Little weight is to be attached to the integration of  an  EEA
         national or the family member of an EEA national within the  United
         Kingdom if the alleged integrating links were formed at  or  around
         the same time as-

            (a)   the commission of a criminal offence;

            (b)   an act otherwise affecting the fundamental  interests  of
            society;

            (c)   the EEA national or family member of an EEA national  was
            in custody.

         (5)  The removal from the United Kingdom of an EEA national or  the
         family member of an EEA national who is able to provide substantive
         evidence of  not  demonstrating  a  threat  (for  example,  through
         demonstrating that the EEA national or the family member of an  EEA
         national has successfully reformed or rehabilitated) is less likely
         to be proportionate.

         (6)   For  the  purposes  of  these  Regulations,  the  fundamental
         interests of society in the United Kingdom include-

            (a)    preventing  unlawful  immigration  and  abuse   of   the
            immigration   laws,   and   maintaining   the   integrity   and
            effectiveness of  the  immigration  control  system  (including
            under these Regulations) and of the Common Travel Area;

            (b)   maintaining public order;

            (c)   preventing social harm;

            (d)   preventing the evasion of taxes and duties;

            (e)   protecting public services;

            (f)   excluding or removing an EEA national or family member of
            an EEA national with a conviction (including where the  conduct
            of that person is likely to  cause,  or  has  in  fact  caused,
            public  offence)  and  maintaining  public  confidence  in  the
            ability of the relevant authorities to take such action;

            (g)   tackling offences likely to cause harm to  society  where
            an immediate or direct victim may be difficult to identify  but
            where there is wider societal harm (such as offences related to
            the misuse of drugs or crime with a cross-border  dimension  as
            mentioned in Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning  of
            the European Union);

            (h)     combating   the   effects   of   persistent   offending
            (particularly in  relation  to  offences,  which  if  taken  in
            isolation, may otherwise be unlikely to meet  the  requirements
            of regulation 27) ...

            (j)   protecting the public;

            (k)   acting in the best interests of a child (including  where
            doing so entails refusing  a  child  admission  to  the  United
            Kingdom, or otherwise taking an EEA decision against  a  child)
            ..."

11. In relation to Article 8 of the ECHR, the relevant  provisions  of  the
    Immigration Rules are contained in Part 13. In addition, Part 5A of the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  features  a  number  of
    public  interest  considerations  to  which  I  must  have  regard,  in
    particular section 117C.

12. It is settled law that the best interests of the child  are  a  primary
    consideration when considering whether removal of  an  appellant  under
    Article 8 would be proportionate, see ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC  4  and
    Zoumbas v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] UKSC 74  at
    [10] per Lord Hodge.   The  same  considerations  will  apply  for  the
    purposes of determining

Burden and standard of proof

13. It is common ground that the appellant enjoys the  right  of  permanent
    residence.  It is, therefore, for the respondent  to  demonstrate  that
    there are serious grounds of public policy or security  to  remove  the
    appellant from the United Kingdom: Straszewski v Secretary of State for
    the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 1245 at [12].

The hearing

14. The appellant relied on the  bundle  he  prepared  for  the  first-tier
    tribunal hearing before Judge Hollingworth. In addition, Ms Wass handed
    up a letter from his probation officer,  Ms  Diplock,  dated  10  March
    2020, and correspondence from a cleaning company  local  to  where  the
    appellant now lives dated 6 March  2020,  concerning  a  new  role  the
    appellant has recently obtained as a cleaning operative.

15. For the respondent, Mr Bramble relied upon the respondent's bundle from
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

16. At the hearing, the appellant, his mother, CM,  and  his  partner,  DS,
    gave evidence and adopted their statements. I permitted Ms Wass to  ask
    a number of additional questions during evidence in chief, primarily to
    ensure that I had the most up-to-date and accurate  evidence  from  all
    three witnesses. A full record of the witnesses' evidence may be  found
    in my Record of Proceedings and,  of  course,  the  hearing  was  audio
    recorded. I do not propose to recite their evidence in  full  but  will
    outline the salient elements of it to  the  extent  necessary  to  give
    reasons for my findings.

17. The day after the hearing, Ms Wass sent the following  message  to  the
    tribunal for my attention, which I took into account  when  considering
    my findings:

         "It came to my attention after the hearing that a submission  which
         I made in respect of the above case (Mr Filipe) was unintentionally
         incorrect. Unfortunately as Mr Bramble had left the building I  was
         unable to ask for  the  Tribunal  to  resume  so  I  could  correct
         matters. I have therefore copied the Presenting Officers Unit in on
         this email so that all parties are made aware.

         During the course of the  hearing  [I]  was  asked  a  question  by
         yourself in respect of 2 7 day prison  sentences  received  by  the
         Appellant in 2016 and [I] made brief submissions in response as  to
         their ability to break continuity. I was reminded by the  Appellant
         after the hearing that he had  not  in  fact  served  two  separate
         custodial sentences for this matter. During the period of these two
         sentences he  was  on  remand  for  an  unrelated  matter.  He  was
         therefore not at liberty at any stage during this period. Therefore
         my submission made in court may have  been  misleading  and  should
         corrected. I apologise for this error."

18. I reached the following findings in light of my  consideration  of  the
    evidence in the case in the round, in  light  of  all  the  submissions
    made.

Findings

Best interests of the children

19. The first issue for my  consideration  is  to  make  findings  of  fact
    concerning the best interests of the children involved.  The  appellant
    has been in a relationship with DS since before he was  imprisoned  for
    the index offence. They are engaged to be married and have  a  daughter
    together, AF, born on 5 August 2017.  They now live together in  Essex,
    away from east London where the appellant lived with  his  mother,  and
    where most of his offending took  place.   DS  has  two  children  from
    another relationship who live with them,  born  in  November  2006  and
    December 2008. The appellant and DS describe the appellant as the step-
    father of these children. In addition, the appellant has a son  from  a
    previous relationship, DM, born in November 2010.

20. In the RFRL, the respondent contended  that  the  appellant  could  not
    enjoy a genuine and subsisting relationship with any of the children in
    his life, as he was in prison at the time. In relation to AF,  she  was
    born only  very  shortly  before  he  began  serving  his  sentence  of
    imprisonment, considered the respondent, and, as such,  a  relationship
    with her was not possible.

21. Having had the benefit  of  the  updated  oral  evidence  of  both  the
    appellant and  DS,  and  the  appellant's  mother,  I  have  reached  a
    different view. In his evidence in chief, the appellant  described  the
    sense of purpose he has achieved following  his  release  from  custody
    while living with and looking after his  daughter.  The  appellant  was
    present at the birth and spent approximately six weeks with  her  prior
    to being imprisoned, and she was taken to visit him in  prison  by  DS,
    initially fortnightly, and latterly weekly.   The  appellant  spoke  in
    detail in his evidence about the  role  he  has  assumed  in  her  life
    following his release.  He described  how  rewarding  he  finds  simple
    matters such as returning to the family home after being out and  being
    greeted by his young daughter. He described the joy she brings him  and
    the positive outlook on life she helps him  to  achieve.  Under  cross-
    examination, he maintained a consistent approach. The  evidence  of  DS
    supported the account that he gave; she described the hands-on approach
    that he takes to bringing up their daughter, for example taking her  to
    the play centre and to school, whereas he would have been  unlikely  to
    have done so previously.

22. In relation to DM, the appellant described how his mother  brought  his
    son to visit him while he was in prison, and  that  he  maintained  his
    relationship that way. The appellant is not named as a father  on  DM's
    birth certificate, but the appellant contended that he has taken a  DNA
    test and is in the process of having the birth certificate amended. The
    appellant's mother's evidence was that she took DM to see the appellant
    in prison and spoke in her oral evidence about how the  appellant  sees
    DM weekends and during the holidays. The evidence of DS was  consistent
    with this evidence. While I was  not  presented  with  any  documentary
    evidence to demonstrate that the appellant is the biological father  of
    DM, I am prepared, for the purposes of this assessment, to accept  that
    the appellant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with him.

23. The evidence of DS was that, while the appellant  was  in  prison,  she
    struggled to cope as a single mother to three children. Childcare costs
    were exorbitant, she said, and she had to rely on family for  help.  It
    was a very difficult time. She spoke in warm terms of the change in the
    appellant's attitude to life following his release from custody and his
    determination to reform his life. She provided a written  statement  in
    support of the appeal which is commendable for the detail  and  clarity
    with which she writes, first,  about  the  impact  of  custody  on  the
    family, and subsequently (amongst other matters) of the  likely  impact
    of the appellant's deportation on the family unit and on the children.

24. I have no hesitation in finding that the appellant is in a genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with AF, with whom he  lives,  along  with  her
    mother, his fianc�e, DS, and with  DM,  with  whom  he  enjoys  regular
    contact. It is in the best interests of AF and DM for the appellant  to
    remain in the United Kingdom. AF will be a British citizen, on  account
    of her mother's nationality, details of  which  were  included  in  the
    papers.  I was not taken to any documentary  evidence  concerning  DM's
    nationality, but there is nothing to suggest that he  has  not  resided
    here all his life. As such, a particular importance  attaches  to  both
    children's continued residence in this country. The  children  that  DS
    has from her previous relationship are in contact  with  their  father,
    who lives here. It would not be possible, and nor does  the  respondent
    contend that it should be contemplated, for  any  of  the  children  to
    accompany the appellant to Portugal. Their best interests are for  them
    to remain in the United Kingdom.

25. Given the ongoing parental relationship enjoyed by the  appellant  with
    AF and DM, it is plainly in their best interests  that  he  remains  in
    this  country,  in  order  to  continue  and   develop   the   parental
    relationship that he has begun with them.

26. That is the background against which my proportionality assessment must
    be conducted.

Continuity of residence

27. The appellant contends that he enjoys the benefit  of  the  "imperative
    grounds" threshold for removal. I disagree, the following reasons.

28. Regulation 3 of the 2016 Regulations makes  provision  for  determining
    continuity of residence.  The general principle, reflected by paragraph
    (3)(a), is that continuity of  residence  is  broken  by  a  period  of
    imprisonment, but in the case of someone who has "resided in the United
    Kingdom for at least ten years", where the criteria in regulation  3(4)
    are met, continuity of residence  will  not  be  deemed  to  have  been
    broken. This reflects the approach of  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the
    European Union ("CJEU") in the line of authorities  established  by  MG
    Case C-400/12 and Onuekwere Case C-378/12.  As the CJEU noted in B  and
    Vomero Joined Cases C-316/16 and C-424/16, periods of imprisonment  "do
    not automatically entail a discontinuity of that 10-year  period"  (see
    [80]);  the  individual  concerned  must  be  "subject  to  an  overall
    assessment in order to determine whether or not he can avail  [himself]
    of that enhanced protection" ([81])

    "...prior to serving a sentence of imprisonment, the EEA  national  had
    forged integrating links with the United Kingdom..."

29. The first criterion in regulation 3(4) is that, prior to the period  of
    imprisonment, the EEA national had forged integrating  links  with  the
    United Kingdom.  Integration "is based  not  only  on  territorial  and
    temporal factors but also on  qualitative  elements,  relating  to  the
    level of integration in the host Member State" (B and Vomero  at  [58],
    quoting Onuekwere at [25], and the caselaw cited).

30. The appellant is able to point to some integrating factors prior to his
    imprisonment for the index offence. He had spent time at school (and at
    times could boast an impressive attendance record) and had  obtained  a
    number of GCSE qualifications. He is the father  to  two  children,  at
    least one of whom  is  British,  and  nothing  has  been  drawn  to  my
    attention to any evidence that the other, if not British, has not lived
    here all his life.  The appellant assumed step-father  responsibilities
    in relation to two other children.  In her statement,  the  appellant's
    mother writes that they would attend church weekly together;  a  weekly
    prayer meeting and the main Sunday  service.  The  appellant  would  be
    active in helping to lead the prayers, she wrote.  He started  training
    with the Princes Trust in 2016 and had a prospective job  lined  up  in
    2017 which he could not start due to being imprisoned.

31.  Set  against  that  is  the  considerable  offending  history  of  the
    appellant.  I  accept  that  the  mere  fact  that  an  individual  has
    convictions which led him or her  to  being  subject  to  a  period  of
    imprisonment cannot, in and of itself, be determinative of the  absence
    of integrating links. That would deprive  the  approach  of  the  CJEU,
    outlined above, of any useful effect; it would be to  pose  a  question
    which would admit of only one answer, for the only reason the  question
    of integrating links would arise would be because an offence  had  been
    committed.  Nevertheless, the appellant's offending  history  prior  to
    his 2017 sentence of four years' imprisonment is a relevant factor when
    considering the question of integration.  He does not face  deportation
    for those offences, but they illuminate his offending.

32. The appellant's offending history demonstrates a worrying crescendo  of
    offending, commencing with  lower  level  offences,  at  a  young  age,
    increasing in seriousness.  Reading the appellant's antecedent history,
    one has a sense of the appellant being given chance after chance  after
    chance by the criminal courts, as demonstrated by  the  relatively  low
    penalties he received for frequent, serious offences.  He was, however,
    sentenced to a period of suspended imprisonment in April 2015  for  the
    possession of an offensive weapon in public, one of the  same  offences
    for which he would later be convicted before the Crown Court.  Although
    that was a suspended sentence of imprisonment, it nevertheless  related
    to conduct which must have passed the  custody  threshold;  it  was  so
    serious that only a custodial sentence would suffice.  As the  evidence
    of DS made clear, the appellant's commitment to his family was  minimal
    if at all existent before his imprisonment.  It  was  his  imprisonment
    that has led to him manifesting signs  of  integration  and  commitment
    that he did not demonstrate previously.

33. I find that the length  and  frequency  of  the  appellant's  offending
    history for his pre-index offence offences was such that the  appellant
    cannot claim to have been integrated in the  United  Kingdom.   He  had
    never worked and spent a good deal of  his  youth  committing  criminal
    offences.  According to DS, before the appellant  was  imprisoned,  his
    interest in his  parental  responsibilities  was  minimal  (although  I
    accept he was present  at  the  birth  of  his  youngest  child).   The
    appellant's offending history includes offences  of  violence,  weapons
    offences, drugs offences and failing to comply with a community  order.
    This is conduct which flies in the face of the fundamental interests of
    society, as set out in  schedule  1  to  the  2016  Regulations.  Under
    schedule 1(4), little weight is to be attached to the integration of an
    EEA national if the alleged integrating links were formed at or  around
    the same time as the commission of a criminal offence.    I  find  that
    the appellant was not integrated prior to his imprisonment.

    "...the effect of the sentence of imprisonment was not such as to break
    those integrating links...

34. The criteria in regulation 3(4) are cumulative. Only if  the  appellant
    met the criterion  in  sub-paragraph  (a)  would  it  be  necessary  to
    consider the remaining criteria. There is a degree of artificiality  in
    any attempt to consider whether the appellant's  imprisonment  for  the
    index offence "was not such as to break  those  integrating  links"  as
    required by regulation 3(4)(b), because I have found that the appellant
    did not have any integrating links in  the  first  place.   Out  of  an
    abundance of caution, I have considered the impact of  the  appellant's
    imprisonment on this consideration in any event.

35. The appellant was imprisoned for the index offence  having  denied  his
    guilt, refusing to admit responsibility to the probation  officer,  and
    maintaining  his  denial  before  me.  I  accept  that  the   appellant
    maintained  contact  with  his  mother,  DS,  and  his  children  while
    imprisoned.  I also accept that  the  experience  of  imprisonment  has
    resulted in him realising the how much he loves his  family,  resulting
    in a new-found commitment to his  fianc�e,  children  and  stepchildren
    (which, according to the evidence of DS, he did not  have  previously).
    However, he still denies responsibility for the offences for  which  he
    was  imprisoned.   The  sentence  of  imprisonment  has   not   had   a
    rehabilitative effect on  his  underlying  attitude  to  his  offending
    conduct,  which  persists  to  this  day,  nor  on   his   remorse   or
    rehabilitation.

    "...taking into account an overall assessment  of  the  EEA  national's
    situation, it would not be appropriate to apply paragraph (3)(a) to the
    assessment of that EEA national's continuity of residence..."

36. My  overall  assessment  falls  to  be  conducted  in  relation  to  an
    individual  who  denies  his  guilt,  and   who   refuses   to   accept
    responsibility for the serious offences for which he was convicted.   I
    accept that there are positive factors which mitigate against  removal,
    such as the appellant's length of residence here, his family situation,
    and the fact he has - just - found work. However, bearing in  mind  the
    hierarchy of residence rights conferred by the  2016  Regulations,  and
    the corresponding expectation of integration which the authors  of  the
    EU regime sought to reflect by each of the tiered levels of protection,
    I do not consider that it is consistent with that expectation  for  the
    appellant to benefit from the highest level of protection.  Integration
    is inconsistent with the appellant's continued denial of  the  offences
    of which he has been convicted.

37. I find, therefore, that the appellant enjoys  the  right  of  permanent
    residence  (pursuant  to  Mr  Bramble's  concession),  and   that   the
    appellant's prospective  removal  must  be  assessed  by  reference  to
    whether there are "serious grounds of public policy or security".

Serious grounds of public policy or security

38. The appellant was sentenced to four years' imprisonment  for  a  single
    count of robbery, and to one  year's  imprisonment  for  the  offensive
    weapon charge, to run concurrently. According to  the  remarks  of  the
    sentencing judge, the knife used by the appellant in the attack  was  a
    hunting knife. He targeted a vulnerable taxi driver,  and  made  untrue
    allegations concerning the victim's alleged racism towards him  at  his
    trial in the Crown Court. The jury must have rejected  that  aspect  of
    his case by their verdict. The judge  described  the  fear  the  victim
    relayed to the court about the experience of being of  being  attacked,
    and the threats the appellant had made towards him during the process.

39. I have no hesitation in finding that the index offences provide serious
    grounds of public security for the deportation of the appellant.

Genuine, present and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the
fundamental interests of society

40. The mere fact that the  conduct  of  the  appellant  provides  "serious
    grounds" of public security  for  his  removal  is,  in  isolation,  an
    insufficient basis for the appellant to be deported.  It  is  necessary
    for there to be an ongoing and current threat.

41. Ms Wass submits  that  the  reforming  experience  of  the  appellant's
    imprisonment is such that he is now much less likely to reoffend, if at
    all. He has moved away from London, and the influence of the peers with
    whom he was involved in his past offending, and  now  lives  in  Essex.
    There is a degree  of  merit  to  these  submissions;  I  have  already
    outlined the positive in fact the appellant's family have  had  on  him
    following his release. He has begun to take an interest in his children
    which he did not demonstrate previously, according to the  evidence  of
    DS.  He has not offended since his release from prison in October 2019.
     These are significant features in the appellant's favour.

42. Set against those considerations, however,  is  the  reality  that  the
    appellant's family responsibilities pre-date his time in prison for the
    index offences by a considerable margin.  Although AF was born after he
    committed the offences, the appellant's son, DM, was born in  2010.  He
    was also in a relationship  with  DS  at  the  time  he  committed  the
    offences. There is considerable force in the submission of  Mr  Bramble
    that the family  circumstances  of  the  appellant  exerted  a  minimal
    restraining influence on him during his escalation into  the  territory
    of the serious offences with which I am now  concerned.   He  may  well
    have a genuine desire to reform at the present time; given the  factors
    I outline below, I do  not  accept  that  it  is  a  resolve  which  is
    resilient or which engages with the underlying causes of his offending.



43. Ms Wass submits that the risk of further offending  identified  by  the
    two OASyS reports before the tribunal, dated 29 September 2017  and  29
    November 2018, demonstrates a downward trajectory of risk. At  page  34
    of the 2017 report, the appellant was assessed as presenting a "medium"
    risk  of  reoffending  overall,  with  a  "high"  risk  of   nonviolent
    reoffending and a "medium" risk  of  violent  offending.  In  the  2018
    report, the risk assessment for both categories was "medium".  In  that
    respect, there is some force to the submission of Ms Wass. From 2017 to
    2018, the risk of the appellant committing  a  nonviolent  offence  was
    downgraded from "high" to "medium".  I bear in mind that the assessment
    I must perform is an assessment of the position  at  the  date  of  the
    hearing before me, and I do not hold against  the  appellant  the  fact
    that there is not an updated OASyS report, which is a matter likely  to
    be out of his hands.

44. The appellant handed up to letters claiming to be from officers at  HMP
    The Mount attesting to his good behaviour in prison and during classes.

45. In his evidence, the appellant explained that, as part of  his  licence
    conditions,  he  will  be  required  to  attend  a   "Thinking   Skills
    Programme".  He was unable to obtain a place on the course  in  custody
    but will do so before the end of his licence period.  The main priority
    for his probation officer at the moment, he said, was for him to obtain
    employment. To that end,  the  appellant  ended  up  a  letter  from  a
    cleaning company local to where he lives, dated 6 March 2020,  with  an
    offer of employment. In his oral evidence, the appellant explained that
    he had experienced difficulties in securing offers of employment  given
    his  offending  record.  As  such,  he  was  pleased  to  have  secured
    employment with this local company. He also  claimed  to  have  had  an
    offer of employment shortly before being imprisoned  in  2017  but  was
    unable to take up that role due to his imprisonment.

46. In Ms Diplock's letter, the appellant is  described  as  having  "fully
    engaged" with the  probation  service.   The  letter  records  that  he
    demonstrated enthusiasm and a proactive attitude towards resettling  in
    the community. He applied for a variety  of  jobs  and  demonstrated  a
    willingness to work in any sector (the letter predated the  appellant's
    most recent offer of employment). Ms Diplock wrote that  the  appellant
    appeared to continue to build a strong relationship with DM, as well as
    with DS and their children. Ms Diplock said that she did not doubt  the
    appellant's desire to be a positive role model towards his  family.  He
    had recently passed his driving test, which demonstrates  that  he  was
    able to set himself goals and that he had a "good understanding" of the
    issues identified as being linked to his offending behaviour.

47. The difficulty with the above analysis is that the appellant  continues
    to deny responsibility for the main offences  for  which  he  has  been
    convicted. That is identified as a  concerning  factor  in  both  OASyS
    reports, as it demonstrates  that  the  appellant  does  not  have  any
    understanding of the underlying conduct of which he  stands  convicted.
    It shows no empathy or insight into the harm he has caused. It prevents
    the appellant from engaging in any meaningful  rehabilitation,  on  the
    basis that, on his view, there is no  need  to  rehabilitate.  Ms  Wass
    realistically did not invite me to purport to be able to go behind  the
    appellant's conviction. He was convicted by a jury  following  a  trial
    and did not seek to renew his application for leave to  appeal  against
    his conviction, as he would have been entitled to, following refusal on
    the papers by the single judge.

48. The appellant's  refusal  to  take  responsibility  for  his  offending
    conduct means that I am unable to accept the submission of Ms Wass that
    the trajectory of the appellant's risk of reoffending will have reduced
    by a significant margin. It is difficult to see how  it  could  do  so,
    given he refuses to accept guilt for the offences of which he has  been
    convicted.

49. Although Ms Diplock writes that she  does  not  doubt  the  appellant's
    resolve to be a positive role  model  for  his  family,  she  does  not
    address his risk of reoffending in any detail. In her  final  paragraph
    she writes:

         "[The appellant] has recently passed his  driving  test,  which  he
         worked hard towards achieving. He is  able  to  set  himself  goals
         demonstrates a good understanding of the issues identified as being
         linked to his offending behaviour. [The appellant] understands what
         is required of him to successfully complete  his  sentence  and  is
         aware of the opportunities available for him to utilise during this
         time also."

50. It is not clear on what basis Ms Diplock is  able  to  state  that  the
    appellant "demonstrates a good understanding of the  issues  identified
    as being linked to his offending  behaviour"  given  he  maintains  his
    denial for the offending behaviour in  question.  It  may  be  that  Ms
    Diplock is referring to certain other matters identified in the earlier
    OASyS reports, for  example  the  absence  of  an  identifiable  income
    stream. However, it is difficult to ascribe much weight to  the  letter
    from  Ms  Diplock  when  assessing  the   appellant's   likelihood   of
    reoffending, given he maintained before me, as he always has done, that
    he bears no responsibility for the serious  offences  of  violence  for
    which he was sentenced to 4 years' imprisonment.   In  any  event,  her
    letter is silent as to the issue of the risk of future  harm  posed  by
    the appellant.

51. I also note that paragraph (3) of schedule 1 to  the  2016  Regulations
    states that where an EEA national has received  a  custodial  sentence,
    the  longer  the  sentence,  the  greater  the  likelihood   that   the
    individual's continued  presence  represents  a  genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests
    of  society.  This  appellant  received  a  sentence  of  four   years'
    imprisonment. In isolation, this is not  a  factor  which  would  count
    significantly against the appellant; the underlying  regime  which  the
    2016 Regulations seek to implement is based on individual  assessments,
    rather than general principles applied in a non-case  specific  manner.
    Nevertheless, when addressing the risk that the appellant is likely  to
    pose, the seriousness of the offence, as indicated by the length of the
    sentence, is a  factor  which  must  be  considered,  and  which  I  do
    consider.   A  sentence  of  four  years'  imprisonment  is  a  weighty
    sentence, for a serious offence.

52. Ms Wass submits that it is to the appellant's credit that  he  has  not
    sought to feign accepting responsibility.  I  disagree.   He  has  been
    convicted of the offence and so can enjoy no "credit" for continuing to
    deny the offences of which he stands convicted.  There is no reward  in
    this tribunal for such attitudes.

53. I find that, given the refusal of the appellant to take  responsibility
    for his serious offending, the  continued  presence  of  the  appellant
    represents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting
    one of the fundamental interests of society.  I reach  this  conclusion
    taking into consideration the fact that the appellant no  longer  lives
    in the area of London where his previous offending took place, the fact
    that he has not committed any offences since 18 October 2019,  when  he
    was released from prison, and that  he  currently  has  a  genuine  and
    heartfelt desire to be a good role model for his family.  Those factors
    are of some merit, but not determinative merit.  The appellant presents
    a risk, partly because he is unable to accept that he  has  engaged  in
    any conduct which would give rise to the possibility that he presents a
    risk.

Considerations such as  the  age,  state  of  health,  family  and  economic
situation...

54. The appellant has resided in  the  United  Kingdom  for  a  significant
    portion of his life; he arrived aged 11 and is now 27.   He  has  spent
    the entirety of his formative years here.  He claims a history of minor
    kidney problems, but nothing that could not be treated in Portugal.

55. There was no challenge from Mr Bramble to the appellant's evidence that
    he has no real links with Portugal and that all his  Portuguese  family
    live here (although  I  note  that  the  RFRL  highlights  the  serious
    criminal record of his cousin).  That said, no part of the  appellant's
    case was that he can no longer speak Portuguese, where he completed his
    primary education until moving here aged 11, and so I find that, if  he
    were able to return, he would be able to at least speak the language.

56. The appellant has not known his father since he was a young age and has
    been brought up by his mother. His mother would be impacted  deeply  by
    his deportation.

57. I have found that the appellant currently has a genuine  and  heartfelt
    desire to be a positive role model for his son and  daughter,  and  for
    his stepchildren. He now plays an integral role in the family  life  he
    enjoys  with  DS,  and  now   helps   with   childcare   and   fatherly
    responsibilities in a way that  he  did  not  previously.  His  current
    desire is to maintain this level of support, and  to  find  work.   His
    deportation is contrary to the best interests of  his  children;  as  I
    have set out above, their best interests are overwhelmingly  in  favour
    of him remaining in this country.  If the appellant is removed, his son
    and daughter will be deprived of their father.

58. The appellant's pre-imprisonment social and  cultural  integration  was
    minimal, but the steps  he  is  taking  at  the  moment  demonstrate  a
    trajectory of integration, with his responsibilities as a father and  a
    prospective employee.  He no longer  lives  in  London,  where  he  was
    surrounded by offending influences (although I  recall  he  refuses  to
    accept his guilt for the index offence).  In  response  to  a  question
    from me, he said that he has not smoked  cannabis  since  before  being
    imprisoned.  The appellant is now more  integrated  than  he  has  ever
    been.  While, on one view, that is not saying a great deal, given  this
    appellant's history, it is nevertheless progress of a sort which I  can
    take into account.

59. The appellant's economic situation is poor, in that he appears never to
    have worked previously, although I accept that he does enjoy  an  offer
    of employment at the moment, and there is no suggestion  that  DS  does
    not work.

60.  Drawing  the  above  analysis  together,  I  find  that  it  would  be
    proportionate for the appellant to be deported.  He has committed  very
    serious offences for which  he  refuses  to  take  responsibility,  and
    therefore continues to represent a risk of reoffending.  The length  of
    his residence here and his wider family circumstances are factors which
    are outweighed by the serious grounds of public  policy  his  continued
    presence represents.  Although DS  found  life  without  the  appellant
    while he was in prison difficult, she was able to cope.   She  will  be
    able to remain in contact with him, and Portugal is a relatively  short
    flight away for the purposes of visiting, should she  wish  to  do  so.
    The genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting  one  of
    the fundamental interests of  society  is  a  weighty  reason  for  the
    appellant's deportation to proceed.   The  cumulative  force  of  these
    factors is capable of outweighing the best interests of the appellant's
    children in this country.  Depriving children of their father  in  this
    way is not a decision I take lightly.  However, it is the  sad  reality
    of criminal conduct  that  it  wrecks  families.   The  impact  on  the
    children, and on DS, has not been demonstrated  to  exceed  that  which
    would normally flow from the consequences of deportation.

61. Although the appellant claims not to have  any  remaining  contacts  in
    Portugal, he has not sought to contend  that  he  does  not  speak  the
    language.  No reasons have been provided as to why he would not be able
    to  re-familiarise  himself  with  the  culture  and  customs  of   his
    childhood.  His desire to work will be able to find expression  in  the
    Portuguese labour market; there is nothing to stop the  appellant  from
    being able to search for work in Portugal upon his  return.   He  is  a
    relatively young adult of  working  age.   The  fact  he  has  recently
    received an offer  of  employment  in  this  country  demonstrates  his
    ability and resolve to engage with the labour market.  No part  of  his
    case demonstrated that he would not be able to search for work upon his
    return.  I have been taken to no evidence which demonstrates  that  the
    appellant would not receive adequate healthcare in Portugal.

62. The appellant's deportation would be a proportionate  response  to  the
    risk that he poses, taking into account his family  situation  and  the
    matters  outlined  above.   His  deportation  would  not   breach   the
    appellant's rights under the EU Treaties.

Article 8

63. Ms Wass did not pursue any standalone Article 8  submissions.   Turning
    to paragraph 398 of the Immigration  Rules  and  section  117C  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,  as  applied  to  the
    appellant's situation, the appellant could only succeed under Article 8
    if he could demonstrate there are very  compelling  circumstances  over
    and above the exceptions contained in paragraph 399 or 399A.

64. To satisfy one of the exceptions in paragraph 399, the appellant  would
    have to demonstrate that the effect of his deportation would be  unduly
    harsh on either his children or DS.  For the reasons set out  above  in
    my analysis of the appellant's wider circumstances, this  exception  is
    not met.

65. The  exception  in  paragraph  399A  would  require  the  appellant  to
    demonstrate that there would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  his
    integration in Portugal.  Again, for the reasons set out above, I  find
    that there would be no such obstacles.

66. There are no features in  the  case  which  go  beyond  the  above  two
    criteria.  The overall proportionality assessment under EU law leads to
    the same conclusion if applied to the appellant when assessing  Article
    8(2).  The cumulative force of these factors is capable of  outweighing
    the best interests of the  children  involved.   The  appellant  cannot
    succeed under Article 8.

Anonymity

67. I do not consider it appropriate to maintain the anonymity  order  made
    by Judge Hollingworth (and nor did Mr Justice Goss in his error of  law
    decision).  I have anonymised the details of the appellant's family  in
    this decision.  There is no public interest sufficient to override  the
    principle of open justice which otherwise demands  publication  of  the
    details of the appellant and this appeal.

Notice of Decision

This appeal is dismissed on EU law grounds.

This appeal is dismissed on Article 8 grounds.

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms K Wass, Counsel instructed by McCormacks law


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by permission granted on 28 October 2019 against  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth  promulgated  on  26
    July 2019 allowing the respondent's appeal  against  the  Secretary  of
    State's decision  of  28  February  2019  making  a  deportation  order
    pursuant to the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2016
    ("the Regulations")  on  the  grounds  that  his  deportation  was  not
    justified on imperative grounds of public security.

2.   For the avoidance of confusion, we shall refer  to  the  respondent  in
    this appeal as the claimant.

3.   The appellant is a Portuguese national born  on  19  August  1992.   He
    claims to have entered the United Kingdom in  July  2004.   Between  18
    March 2009, when he was aged 16 years, and 15 September 2017,  when  he
    was 25 years  of  age,  he  acquired  twelve  convictions  for  fifteen
    offences including offences against the  person,  property  and  public
    order as well as five controlled drugs offences and three  firearms  or
    offensive weapon offences.  His last conviction, on 15 September  2017,
    was for offences of robbery and the possession of an  offensive  weapon
    for which he was sentenced to a  total  of  four  years'  imprisonment.
    That resulted in his imprisonment until 15 September 2019  followed  by
    immigration detention until 21 October 2019.  He  had  previously  been
    imprisoned for a period of days, it is not clear  precisely  how  many,
    but anywhere between four and eleven,  in  July  2016  for  an  earlier
    offence.

4.   There is a single main ground of appeal, namely that the judge  made  a
    material error of law in his determination by finding that  deportation
    had to be justified on imperative grounds of public safety and  thereby
    applied the wrong test.

5.   The Secretary of State accepts  that  the  claimant  had  acquired  the
    right of permanent residence and so benefited from the medium level  of
    protection from deportation pursuant to Regulation 27(3),  namely  that
    the decision could only be taken on serious grounds  of  public  policy
    and public security.

6.   By Regulation 27(4) a relevant decision, being  defined  in  Regulation
    27(1) as an EEA decision taken on the grounds of public policy,  public
    security or public health, may not be taken on  imperative  grounds  of
    public security in respect of an EEA national who:

         "(a) has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous  period  of
         at least ten years prior to the relevant decision".

    However, it is clear that imprisonment is capable of breaking  the  ten
    year period as is provided for by Regulation 3, the provisions relating
    to continuity of residence.

7.   Regulation 3 provides:

         "Continuity of residence


         3. - (1) This regulation applies for  the  purpose  of  calculating
             periods of continuous residence in the  United  Kingdom  under
             these Regulations.


             ...


             (3)  Continuity of residence is broken when-


                 (a)   a person serves a sentence of imprisonment;


                  ...


             (4)   Paragraph  (3)(a)  applies,  in  principle,  to  an  EEA
             national who has resided in the United Kingdom for at least 10
             years but it does not  apply  where  the  Secretary  of  State
             considers that -


                 (a)   prior to serving a sentence of imprisonment, the  EEA
                 national has  forged  integrating  links  with  the  United
                 Kingdom;


                 (b)   the effect of the sentence of  imprisonment  was  not
                 such as to break those integrating links; and


                 (c)   taking into account an overall assessment of the  EEA
                 national's situation, it would not be appropriate to  apply
                 paragraph (3)(a) to the assessment of that  EEA  national's
                 continuity of residence."

8.   The judge determined that  the  claimant's  continuity  of  ten  years'
    residence prior to the making of the deportation decision had not  been
    broken by his periods of imprisonment.  He did not  specifically  refer
    to Regulation 3 though he may have intended, in  paragraph  10  of  his
    judgment, to have been referring to it.   In  any  event,  he  did  not
    engage with the requirements of Regulation  3.   He  made  no  specific
    reference to the period of imprisonment for the  index  offences.   The
    judge considered that his integration was not broken by reason  of  the
    short period of imprisonment in 2016 and then took the  wrong  date  in
    relation to determination of the ten years preceding  which  there  had
    been continuous residence when he should have taken  the  date  of  the
    deportation decision.

9.   Further to that finding, and critically, in our view, in  paragraph  14
    of his judgment the judge said:

         "I find that the  approach  which  has  been  taken  by  [DS]  (the
         claimant's  fianc�e)  is  fundamental  to  the  prospects  of   the
         [claimant] in achieving successful rehabilitation ... I  find  that
         the [claimant] has plainly damaged his level of integration through
         his behaviour.  I find that [the claimant] is able to  secure  full
         reintegration into the United Kingdom through the family life which
         will be led with [DS] and the children."

9.   Flaux LJ, in paragraph 4 of the lead judgment of the  Court  of  Appeal
    in the case of Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  v  Viscu
    [2019] EWCA Civ 1052, with which  Lewison  and  Underhill  LJJ  agreed,
    after reviewing the relevant recent  cases  of  the  CJEU  relating  to
    protection against expulsion, stated:

         "44. The CJEU jurisprudence to which I  have  referred  establishes
             (i) that the degree of protection against expulsion to which a
             Union national resident in another member  state  is  entitled
             under  the  Directive  is  dependent  upon   the   degree   of
             integration of that individual in the member state; (ii)  that
             in general a custodial sentence is indicative of  a  rejection
             of societal values and thus of a severing of integrative links
             with the member state but (iii) that the extent to which there
             is such a severing of integrative links will  depend  upon  an
             overall assessment of the individual's situation at  the  time
             of the expulsion decision."

10.  The passage of the judgment to which we  have  referred,  at  the  very
    least,  implies  that  the  judge  found  that  the  claimant  was  not
    integrated in the United Kingdom at the time of the material  decision,
    but that he had  the  potential  to  reintegrate  in  the  future.   We
    consider that to be an error of law.  Under Regulation 3(4), it was for
    the judge to determine whether the integrating links previously  forged
    by  the  appellant  had  been  broken  by  his  imprisonment.   In  his
    discussion at paragraph 10, the judge appeared  to  conclude  that  the
    appellant's  imprisonment  had  not  broken   his   previously   forged
    integrating links.  That finding  was  inconsistent  with  the  judge's
    later findings, quoted above, that the appellant's fianc�e  would  help
    him to reintegrate in the future.  Either the appellant was integrated,
    or he was not.  If  reintegration  was  required,  by  definition,  the
    appellant must have lost his previous integrating links, and could  not
    enjoy the  protection  of  the  "imperative  grounds"  protection  from
    removal.  In these circumstances, we need go no further in relation  to
    an analysis of the judge's decision or the  basis  for  his  conclusion
    that integrating links had previously been  forged  by  the  appellant,
    given his  background  of  persistent  offending;  this  passage  alone
    reveals that the basis for the claimant being entitled to the  enhanced
    level  of  protection  from  deportation  under  Regulation  27(4)  was
    materially flawed.

11.  Accordingly, we find that there was an error of law in this  case  such
    that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal must be set aside.


Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed.

The decision of Judge Hollingworth involved the making of an  error  of  law
and is set aside.

We order that the appeal be reheard by this Tribunal.

No findings of Judge Hollingworth are preserved  for  the  purpose  of  that
hearing.


No anonymity direction is made.
