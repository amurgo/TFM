Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr M Symes, counsel, instructed by Irvine Thanvi
                    Natas Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Z Kiss, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision  of  First-
      tier  Tribunal  Judge  Swaniker,  promulgated  on  7  September  2018,
      dismissing his claim against the respondent's decision dated 14 August
      2017 to refuse leave to remain in the UK.

   2. In refusing his claim the respondent  noted  that  the  appellant  had
      applied for leave to remain outside the Immigration Rules, in order to
      pursue legal  proceedings  against  his  former  employer  through  an
      Employment Tribunal. That was not a purpose covered by the Rules.

   3. The respondent also concluded that the  particular  circumstances  set
      out in his application did not constitute compassionate or exceptional
      factors warranting a grant of leave to remain outside the  Immigration
      Rules.

   4. Judge Swaniker noted at [10] that it was clear  that  his  application
      was for leave to remain outside the Rules,  as  was  conceded  by  his
      counsel, and the cover letter had stated that he wished to  pursue  an
      application  outside  the  Immigration  Rules   for   the   grant   of
      discretionary leave "due to his exceptional/compelling circumstances."



   5. She noted that the letter raised a discrete  Article  8  private  life
      issue outside the Rules on the basis  of  what  was  said  to  be  the
      appellant's  exceptional/compelling  circumstances.  Accordingly,  she
      rejected a preliminary issue raised by the presenting  officer  as  to
      whether  there  was  an  effective  human  rights  appeal  before  the
      Tribunal. She found that the appellant had made a valid  human  rights
      appeal.

   6. She considered the oral evidence from the appellant which she has  set
      out. He confirmed that he had relatives in India, his parents. He  has
      a sister there who is a dentist [12]. When  asked  if  there  was  any
      reason why he could not pursue his case from India, he said he did not
      have any funds and up to now it had been just  himself  and  the  Free
      Representation Unit pursuing his employment case before  the  Tribunal
      [12].

   7. When asked whether he had considered asking the FRU to  represent  him
      from abroad he said that his understanding was that '... you still had
      to do  all  the  paperwork  and  they  would  only  represent  you  at
      hearings'. He said that he did research and went  to  the  library  to
      carry this out. He did not have any evidence from FRU as to what  they
      could do or not, to assist him [12].

   8. First-tier Tribunal Judge Swaniker found on the  evidence  before  her
      that the appellant had not established family life in the UK. Nor  had
      he met the requirements under paragraph 276ADE(1) of  the  Immigration
      Rules. There were no very significant  obstacles  to  his  integration
      into India upon return. He arrived in the UK in June 2010 at  the  age
      of 21. He is a well educated man with a degree in Chemical Engineering
      and a Masters in Business Administration from a UK  university.  There
      was no evidence that he suffered any serious  health  issues.  He  had
      made an overall recovery from the depression and anxiety he  was  said
      to have suffered consequent to his problems with his employer [17].

   9. There were no exceptional circumstances consistent  with  a  right  to
      private enjoyment of his private life under  Article  8  warranting  a
      grant of leave to remain on Article 8 grounds [19].

  10. She found he also had access to a remedy against  his  employer  which
      lay before the Employment Tribunal. He  had  succeeded  in  his  claim
      against his ex-employer and judgment had been  given  in  his  favour.
      There was  no  justification  for  any  claim  of  unfairness  in  the
      circumstances [20].

  11. She noted that the appellant's counsel also raised Article  6  in  his
      human rights argument. She found that there was no  substance  to  the
      argument that a fair hearing demanded that he  should  be  allowed  to
      remain in the UK until  the  Employment  Tribunal  case  came  to  its
      finality [21].

  12. Although the appellant's  ex-employer  had  sought  to  challenge  the
      Employment Tribunal judgment by injunction proceedings,  so  that  the
      appellant's case has not been finally resolved, there is  no  credible
      reason why the appellant should or would be  unable  to  instruct  FRU
      from overseas to represent him in the UK [21].

  13. She found that the appellant would be able to continue  to  carry  out
      any necessary research including research conducted via  the  Internet
      to advance his Employment Tribunal claim as required, and to  instruct
      the FRU who  would  already  be  familiar  with  his  case  and  would
      therefore likely readily be able to continue to represent him  in  the
      same capacity. He  could  instruct  them  from  India.  There  was  no
      "reliable evidence" to demonstrate that the appellant was required  to
      be in the UK in order to be able to adequately  advance  or  otherwise
      pursue his Employment Tribunal case. He is an  intelligent,  informed,
      tenacious and capable individual [21].

  14. Nor was there any credible reason why he should be allowed  to  remain
      in the UK to secure a new Tier 2 sponsor and apply for  further  leave
      on that basis. Since the curtailment of his leave,  he  has  had  more
      than ample opportunity to follow through with such an  application  or
      at least to seek to follow through with such an  application.  He  had
      not done  so.  He  is  free  to  make  such  an  application  for  the
      appropriate visa from India should he secure the required  sponsorship
      [22].

  15. First-tier Tribunal Judge Swaniker accordingly did not accept that  he
      had shown any compelling circumstances in his case.  Although  he  has
      likely established some element of a private life  here  she  did  not
      accept that there would be a disproportionate interference  with  this
      if he were now to leave the UK.

  16. She had regard to the public interest considerations set out in s.117B
      of the 2002 Act and concluded that the respondent's  decision  pursues
      the legitimate aim of maintaining effective immigration control in the
      wider interests of society. Any interference with his private life  is
      proportionate [24].

  17. She accordingly dismissed his appeal on human rights grounds, Articles
      6 and 8.

  18. In granting permission to appeal, First-tier Tribunal Judge I D  Boyes
      stated that it was not possible for her to determine whether the Judge
      was  right  or  wrong  "as  simply  not  enough  is  known  about  the
      proceedings." She stated that "one would have thought that if  it  was
      the case that the appellant was involved and entangled in  litigation,
      then there would have been  a  consideration  of  discretionary  leave
      and/or some evidence from his counsel/FRU about the need for him to be
      in the UK. Those circumstances should be examined on appeal."

  19. Mr Symes, who did not represent the appellant  before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal, and did not settle the grounds of appeal, noted  that  there
      three grounds of appeal have been advanced.

  20. The first ground contended that the Judge adopted the wrong test as to
      whether the appellant's human rights would be breached. Reference  was
      made to the House of Lords  decision  in  Huang  [2007]  Ac  167.  The
      Tribunal need not ask whether the case meets a test of exceptionality.



  21. Mr Symes submitted with regard to [19] of the determination  that  the
      Judge in looking outside the Rules has "wrongly  set  the  prism".  He
      acknowledged that this was "not the best ground".

  22.  He  submitted  with  regard  to  Ground  2,  paragraph  2,  that  the
      appellant's primary case was the need to remain in the  UK  to  pursue
      litigation in the Employment Tribunal. His removal would  deprive  him
      of his human rights protected by Articles 6 and 8 by depriving him  of
      the chance of a fair trial and therefore compensation  for  the  wrong
      done to him.

  23. Mr Symes referred to [20] of the Tribunal's decision where  the  Judge
      noted that he had succeeded in his claim against his ex-employers.  He
      referred to page 34 of the  appellant's  bundle,  which  contains  the
      reasons of the Employment Tribunal allowing his appeal.  The  Tribunal
      stated that as far as they could  determine,  all  the  employers  and
      employees worked under visa arrangements that were entirely  dependent
      on their employer. They were satisfied  with  the  claimant's  account
      that the employer enforced this culture of  dependency  upon  him  and
      then proceeded to extort money from him.

  24. It is evident that the employer sought to appeal that decision and was
      30 days out of time. The respondent's - Mr Dogra's-  comments  on  the
      employer's application to extend time are produced at pages 74-75.  It
      was contended that he had put his life on hold for two  years  to  see
      the proceedings through. He was awarded his due after serious findings
      were made against the employer that amounted to fraud  and  extortion.
      He contended that he should not be required to wait  any  longer  just
      because the employer cannot file papers on time.

  25. I have also had regard to the order of Master Gidden  sitting  in  the
      Queen's Bench Division, dated 19 July 2018, produced at page 76 of the
      bundle.  He considered an application by the employer for  a  stay  of
      enforcement. He ordered that there be a stay pending the determination
      of the defendant employer's  appeals  from  the  Employment  Tribunal.
      Should the appeal be  unsuccessful  the  stay  will  automatically  be
      lifted.

  26. On 25 August 2018, a consent order was approved by Cheema Grubb  J  in
      the Queen's Bench Division [78-79]. The application made by  Mr  Dogra
      for an order discharging the order of Ouseley J dated 9 July 2018  and
      the  order  of  Master  Gidden  dated  19  July  2018,  was  adjourned
      generally. It was ordered that there be a stay of execution in respect
      of  the  employer's  liability  pending  the  final  disposal  of  the
      employer's appeal in the proceedings.

  27. In consideration for the parties' agreeing to enter into  that  Order,
      it was agreed by the employer, Mr Dogra and the Managing  Director  of
      the employer, that the employer would pay �50,000 into court to  abide
      the outcome of the employer's appeals in the ET claim and will pay out
      to Mr Dogra, in the event of the failure or to the appropriate extent,
      partial failure, of the said appeals, in the amount of �50,000  to  be
      paid into the Court's Fund Office by 8 August 2018, and a further  sum
      of �50,000 to be  paid  into  Court  by  29  August  2018  or  in  the
      alternative, the employer was to provide reasonable security.

  28. Mr Symes submitted that in the event of any re-hearing, the  appellant
      would be in India and will accordingly be disadvantaged.  He  asserted
      that the appellant does not have the  money  to  proceed.  During  the
      course of his submissions the appellant informed the Tribunal that  he
      had received �10,000 on account in September 2018.

  29. The  amount  awarded  by  the  Employment  Tribunal  was  �124,658.82,
      including loss of earnings to "Remedies Hearing" (gross), future  loss
      of earnings (gross) and ACAS uplift (on compensatory award) at 20%.

  30. Mr Symes submitted that the only help he has thus far received is from
      the FRU.

  31. It was also contended that the  Judge  erred  in  the  proportionality
      assessment by making a mistake as to the true immigration  history  of
      the appellant, and in that basis making adverse finding  that  he  had
      overstayed or failed to apply for further leave.

  32. However,  despite  the  fact  that  the  Home  Office  record  of  the
      appellant's immigration history set  out  in  the  refusal  letter  is
      provably incorrect, it was on that incorrect basis that the  Judge  at
      [22] suggested that the appellant's 'last leave' expired on 10  August
      2015 and that he had not sought leave to extend that leave.  In  fact,
      it is contended that he applied to extend the leave on 10 August  2015
      in time. That application was granted. It was  then  curtailed  to  18
      July 2018. He then made an in time application but with a  fee  waiver
      application which was later rejected, meaning that the application was
      deemed invalid. A further application was then made on 25 October 2016
      leading to the current appeal.

  33. Mr Symes submitted with regard to [22] where the Judge stated that the
      appellant had not sought to make an application to secure a new Tier 2
      sponsor and apply for further leave on that basis, that the  appellant
      cannot get one until he sorts out his immigration history. It  is  not
      possible for him to get a reference following  his  "victory"  against
      his former employer. Until proceedings are completed, he cannot get  a
      job.

  34. On behalf of the respondent, Ms Kiss submitted with regard to Ground 1
      that there was  nothing  wrong  with  the  Judge's  test  relating  to
      exceptional circumstances. She referred to the decision of the Supreme
      Court in Agyarko and Ikuga, R (on the applications of) v  SSHD  [2017]
      UKSC 11 at [19].  There  the  Court  considered  para  3.2.7d  of  the
      Instructions in force, which state that although an  application  will
      normally  be  appropriate  where  the  applicant  does  not  meet  the
      requirements of the Rules, leave can  be  granted  outside  the  Rules
      where exceptional circumstances apply. The  Instructions  referred  to
      "exceptional"  as  not  meaning  "unusual"  or  "unique".  They   mean
      circumstances in which refusal would  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
      consequences for the individual such that refusal of  the  application
      would not be proportionate. That is likely to be the  case  only  very
      rarely.

  35. Lord Reed stated  at  [19]  that  in  considering  whether  there  are
      exceptional  circumstances,  the  decision  maker  is  instructed   to
      consider all relevant factors, examples of which are set out.

  36. Lord Reed stated at [19] that it is also pointed out  that  cumulative
      factors should be considered. In particular, although under the  Rules
      family  life  and  private  life  are  considered   separately,   when
      considering whether there are exceptional circumstances, both  private
      and family life can be taken into account.

  37. With regard to Ground 2, Ms Kiss submitted that the  Judge  looked  at
      Article 6 in detail.  That  Article  is  not  within  the  immigration
      system. The Judge was aware  that  the  appellant's  appeal  with  his
      erstwhile employer has not been resolved. She submitted  that  in  any
      event he could still instruct the FRU. No  credible  reason  has  been
      advanced as to why he would be unable to conduct any relevant research
      from India. On that basis he would be able to continue to instruct the
      FRU from abroad.

  38. Ms Kiss referred to paragraph 26 of the judgement  of  the  Employment
      Tribunal, where the Tribunal set  out  his  immigration  history.  His
      application for further leave to remain was refused in August 2017  as
      the Home Office contended that there were no exceptional circumstances
      warranting the grant of such immigration status.

  39. The Tribunal accepted that it was a condition of his further leave  to
      remain that he has not been permitted to work in the UK since 17  July
      2016. The  Employment  Tribunal  at  [26]  noted  that  the  appellant
      accepted that he could apply for a further Tier 2 visa but, as  he  is
      in the UK under a different immigration status, he would need to leave
      the UK and apply out of country.

  40. At [35] of the judgment, the Employment Tribunal held that but for his
      dismissal, he would have continued to work  in  the  UK  until  August
      2020. They considered whether it would be proportionate to  award  him
      his loss of earnings for a period of over two and  a  half  years  and
      they determined that rather than impose an arbitrary cut  off  period,
      without any factual basis whatsoever, it would be appropriate to award
      the claimant his losses in full for the entirety of his original  visa
      placement with the employer.

  41. Ms Kiss submitted that the First-tier Tribunal Judge accepted that the
      appellant would be able to continue to pursue his claim from abroad.

  42. She submitted that Ground 3 relates to a "minor matter." She submitted
      that "this is a strange assertion." The Judge  accepted  that  he  was
      here legally.

      Assessment

  43. The First-tier Tribunal Judge rejected the assertion of the presenting
      officer that the appellant had not raised a human  rights  element  in
      his application. She noted that  his  application  was  for  leave  to
      remain outside the Immigration Rules, as conceded by his counsel.  His
      cover letter had asserted that he  wished  to  submit  an  application
      outside the Rules with a grant  of  discretionary  leave  due  to  his
      exceptional/ compelling circumstances [10].

  44. She proceeded to consider  his  application  outside  the  Rules.  She
      accepted that his "situation" vis a vis his Tier 2 leave was  not  his
      fault and that his ex-employer failed to comply with the terms of  his
      employment contract, and  that  his  wrongful  dismissal  led  to  the
      mandatory curtailment of his  leave  under  the  general  grounds  for
      refusal as he did not have a Tier 2 sponsor [19]. However,  she  found
      that whether or not he was at fault,  he  ceased  to  have  a  Tier  2
      sponsor and did not meet the requirements for leave  to  remain  as  a
      Tier 2 migrant.

  45. She had regard to his pursuance of  a  remedy  before  the  Employment
      Tribunal. In that respect she had regard to the assertion that he  had
      a right to a fair hearing which demanded that he be allowed to  remain
      in the UK until the Employment Tribunal case came to its finality.

  46. She had regard to the  attempts  being  made  by  his  ex-employer  to
      challenge the judgment in the appellant's favour. She referred to  the
      injunction proceedings which I have set out.

  47. Having assessed the evidence as a whole however, she found that  there
      was no credible reason why the appellant should or would be unable  to
      instruct FRU from overseas to represent him in the  UK.   No  credible
      reason was given why he would be unable to continue carrying  out  the
      required  research  from  India  and  follow  up  with  any  paperwork
      required.

  48. She gave reasons  for  that  conclusion:  The  FRU  would  already  be
      familiar  with  his  case.  There  was  no  "reliable   evidence"   to
      demonstrate that he is required  to  be  in  the  UK  to  be  able  to
      adequately advance or pursue his case with  the  Employment  Tribunal.
      She had regard  to  his  past  qualifications,  his  response  to  his
      employment situation and the Employment Tribunal claim.  That  pointed
      to his being an intelligent, informed, tenacious and capable person.

  49. Nor was there any credible reason why he should be allowed  to  remain
      in the UK to secure a new Tier 2 sponsor and apply for  further  leave
      on  that  basis.  She  accepted  that  he  had  suffered  anxiety  and
      depression following  his  experiences  with  his  previous  employer.
      Having received  therapy,  "he  is  better  now  and  is  not  on  any
      medication or therapy" [22].

  50. She did not accept the argument  that  he  should  be  placed  in  the
      position he would have been in if his last employer had not wrongfully
      dismissed him and the Home Office curtailed his leave.

  51. In  the  circumstances  she  concluded  that  he  had  not  shown  any
      compelling or exceptional circumstances in his case. There would  thus
      not be a disproportionate interference with his  private  life  if  he
      were now to leave the UK.  She  had  regard  to  the  public  interest
      considerations in s.117B of the 2002  Act.  There  was  a  paucity  of
      evidence  as  to  the  nature  and  extent  of  such  a  private  life
      established in the UK whilst he was here.

  52. Having regard to the circumstances a whole, I find that the First-tier
      Tribunal Judge has undertaken a  detailed  assessment  and  has  given
      sustainable reasons for her findings.

  53. I accordingly find that the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  did
      not involve the making of any material errors on a point of law.
