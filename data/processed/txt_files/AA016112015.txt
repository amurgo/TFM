Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Mills, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Azmi, Counsel instructed by Coventry Law Centre


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. For ease of reference I refer to the  Appellant  as  the  Secretary  of
    State and to the Respondent as the Claimant. The Claimant is a national
    of Afghanistan and claimed asylum on 16 September 2014. He  claimed  to
    be 13 � years old and the Secretary of State concluded on the basis  an
    age assessment conducted by Warwickshire County Council that  his  date
    of birth was 1 August 1998. The Secretary of State refused to recognise
    him as a refugee but granted him discretionary leave until  he  reached
    the age of 17 �.

 2. The Claimant appealed the decision to refuse  to  recognise  him  as  a
    refugee. His appeal was allowed by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Row  who
    found that he would be at a real risk of persecution as  an  unattached
    child.  The Secretary of State was granted permission  to  appeal  that
    decision by Designated Judge  Shaerf  on  1  May  2015.  The  grant  of
    permission stated that all grounds were arguable.

 3. The appeal came before me on 2 February 2016 and I found that there was
    an error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and set  the
    decision aside. I determined that the appeal should be reheard  in  the
    Upper Tribunal as limited fact-finding was required.  My  key  findings
    were recorded at paragraphs 13 to 15:

         "13.     However, the First-tier Tribunal had found the  Claimant's
         account to be entirely lacking in credibility at  paragraph  31  of
         the decision. In relation to the question  of  whether  there  were
         family members who could receive the Appellant, the Judge found the
         Respondent was no doubt hampered in her tracing duty  by  the  fact
         that the Appellant claimed not to know where  his  family  was  and
         gave no contact address (paragraph 34). At paragraph 35  the  Judge
         found  that  neither  the  Appellant  nor  those  representing  him
         appeared to have done anything to seek to contact his  family.  The
         Judge further found that his family would have paid a large  amount
         of money to send him to the United Kingdom and neither he nor  they
         were likely to facilitate the loss of that  investment.  The  Judge
         stated at paragraph 38 that it may  be  that  the  Appellant  would
         telephone his parents and ask them to come and pick him up but that
         this was speculation.

         14.      I find that there is a  clear  inconsistency  between  the
         finding that the  Claimant's  claim  in  his  entirety  was  to  be
         disbelieved and the liberal application of the benefit of the doubt
         in  paragraph  39.  Further  the  burden  of  proving  risk  as  an
         unattached child was on  the  Claimant.  At  paragraph  38  of  the
         decision, having found the Claimant's account incredible, the First-
         tier Tribunal concludes that there was no evidence either way as to
         whether his parents could come and pick him  up  in  Kabul.  Having
         found that there was no evidence either way and  having  found  the
         Claimant incredible the First-tier Tribunal  failed  adequately  to
         explain why the Claimant was afforded the benefit of the  doubt  or
         why, in the absence of evidence, he had shown that he would  be  at
         risk. I therefore find that the  First-tier  Tribunal's  conclusion
         that the Claimant was at real risk on the basis of  affected  by  a
         material error of law.

         15.       I  consider  that  there  are  insufficiently  clear  and
         reasoned findings  in  relation  to  whether  the  Claimant  is  an
         unattached child and in the  light  of  the  limited  fact  finding
         required the matter should be retained in the Upper  Tribunal.  The
         findings of fact from paragraph  24  to  31  of  the  decision  are
         preserved."

The Rehearing

 4. The matter came before me for rehearing on 25 July 2016.  In the  light
    of the preserved findings I  concluded  that  oral  evidence  was  only
    required in relation to whether the Claimant was  an  unattached  child
    and the steps he had taken to find his family. The  Claimant  confirmed
    his name and address and adopted his witness statement.

 5. In answer to questions from Mr Azmi he said that he  had  not  had  any
    contact with his family since he came to the UK. He  had  no  telephone
    number and did not have any numbers or contacts.   He  had  no  contact
    from anyone from his local area. He had  received  correspondence  from
    the Red Cross stating that they could not find his family.

 6. Mr Mills put it to him that the last Red Cross letter was from  January
    2016 but they said they would write to him every  two  months  so  they
    should have written to him once or twice since then. He asked if he had
    any more letters. He said that a letter  may  have  been  sent  to  the
    foster carers not to him.

 7. There was no re-examination.

 8. Mr Mills submitted that the Claimant's claim that he had suffered  past
    persecution had been expressly rejected by the  First-tier  Judge.  The
    Judge commented on contact. There was little for the Secretary of State
    to do to trace the family when the claim was not credible. The  tracing
    issue had  died  a  death  after  the  Supreme  Court  decision  in  TN
    (Afghanistan)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department;  AA
    (Afghanistan)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department;  MA
    (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015]  UKSC
    40. With regard to the Court of Appeal decisions, the Claimant  was  at
    the negative end of the spectrum. The only thing that had been done was
    the continuation of  the  Red  Cross  tracing.  There  should  be  more
    letters. The letters simply said that they had not found his relatives.
    We did not know what he told them. The Red Cross said  at  paragraph  5
    that  they  very  much  tried  to  remain  neutral  and  did  not  want
    information given to them as positive evidence in an asylum  claim.  We
    knew he was not a credible witness. The burden  of  proof  was  on  him
    despite him being a minor for a few more days. He could not be believed
    when he said that he had no contact with his family.  I  could  make  a
    positive finding that his family would be able to meet in him Kabul. We
    knew it was safe for an average  citizen.  R  (on  the  application  of
    Nasire) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010]  EWHC  3359
    (Admin) confirmed that Kabul was  sufficiently  safe  and  AK  (Article
    15(c)) Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 00163 (IAC) was  country  guidance.
    There was also room for arguing that he was almost an adult. There  was
    no bright line where risk disappeared at 18 but it worked the other way
    too. There was nothing particularly to show that he  was  a  vulnerable
    individual who would not be able to live safely in Kabul. He  asked  me
    to dismiss the appeal.

 9. Mr Azmi said that there was an age assessment which had  been  provided
    which concluded that he would be 18 next week. His account was that  he
    was much younger and he gave his date of birth as 1  January  2002.  No
    specific finding was made by First-tier  Judge  who  proceeded  on  the
    basis that he was an unaccompanied minor. As of today's date he  was  a
    minor and next week he would be a young  adult  and  the  risk  factors
    still remained the same this week or next week. Those risk  factors  as
    highlighted in AA at page 11 of A's bundle were relevant.  He  referred
    me to pages 42,52, 56 and 82 to 92 of the Claimant's bundle. Kabul  was
    facing a deteriorating security situation  and  the  position  had  got
    worse and this was highlighted in the objective evidence  and  the  key
    passages were set out in both bundles. A key feature  was  whether  the
    Claimant had any support in Afghanistan. It was correct that there  was
    no evidence from the Red Cross but the Claimant's statement showed that
    he was trying to contact individuals to try and get  in  touch  with  a
    commander from the family. The Claimant from his statement at paragraph
    17 had not been able to find anyone from his  province  let  alone  his
    family and would therefore be returning unattached as a young adult and
    there were security risks to him. He  would  be  subjected  to  various
    forms of harm. The conclusion at paragraphs 89 to  92  was  that  there
    would be a real risk of  being  persecuted  and  ill-treated.  He  also
    raised paragraph 276ADE and asked me to find that he left in  2014  and
    had no contact and could not return.

10. Mr Mills submitted that paragraph 276 ADE stood on  fell  on  the  same
    issue. Having found the Claimant to be incredible there was  no  reason
    not to accept the assessment of age.  However, there was a need to make
    a finding.

11. I reserved my decision.

Discussion and Findings

12. I have had regard to all of the evidence submitted by both  parties  in
    coming to my conclusions in this appeal. The preserved findings are  at
    paragraphs 24 to 31 of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The
    Tribunal found that the Claimant's uncle was not subjected to an attack
    by the Taliban. It was not accepted  that  the  Claimant's  father  was
    arrested and that the incident described by the  Claimant  involving  a
    car, the police and a Commander took place.  The  Tribunal  found  that
    threats had not been made by anyone and found that the Claimant did not
    flee the country for fear of his life  or  fear  of  ill-treatment  and
    persecution.

13. It is clear that the Claimant's account of ill-treatment in Afghanistan
    was rejected in  its  entirety.  I  have  considered  firstly  whether,
    despite the First-tier's adverse credibility findings, the Claimant  is
    a refugee as a member of a social group, namely an unattached child who
    could be at risk on return and  secondly  whether  he  is  entitled  to
    humanitarian protection. The First-tier Tribunal made no finding as  to
    the Claimant's age but accepted that  he  was  an  unaccompanied  minor
    within the definition of  the  Asylum  Seekers  (Reception  Conditions)
    Regulations 2005.  There is a dispute as to the Claimant's  age  and  I
    have considered the evidence in respect of the  Claimant's  age  before
    me. The Secretary of State relies on an age assessment conducted  on  2
    October 2014 by Warwickshire County Council. The Claimant was  assessed
    to be 16 years old and his estimated date  of  birth  was  given  as  1
    August 1998.

14. In assessing the Claimant's credibility I have taken account of Article
    4 (3) of the Qualification Directive which requires me in assessing his
    application for international protection to take into account his  age.
    I have also taken into account paragraphs 350-352X of  the  Immigration
    Rules concerning unaccompanied children.

15. The Claimant claimed in his witness statement  dated  17  October  2014
    that he was 13 � years old. At the date of the hearing on his  evidence
    therefore he would be 15 years old.  The age  assessment  conducted  by
    the Secretary of State is "Merton compliant  (R  (B)  v  Merton  London
    Borough Council 2003 EWHC 1689 Admin). The children's asylum team  from
    Warwickshire County Council concluded that the Claimant  was  16  years
    old on the basis of his  physical  demeanor,  his  interaction  at  the
    assessment, his social history and  family  composition,  developmental
    considerations, education, independent/self-care skills and information
    from documentation and  other  sources.  The  age  assessment  is  well
    reasoned and the conclusion based on the fact that  the  Claimant  gave
    inconsistent and contradictory information and  was  considered  to  be
    untruthful on a number of points. He was also considered to  be  trying
    to make himself appear younger than he  was  by  way  of  surreptitious
    removal of facial hair.

16. There is a substantial body of case law on age assessments. It is clear
    from the case law that the determination of age is far  from  an  exact
    science and there are no medical or other scientific  tests  which  can
    determine age with precision.  In  R  (on  the  application  of  GB  by
    litigation friend, Francesco Jeff) v Oxfordshire  County  Council  (age
    dispute- relevance of documents) IJR [2015] UKUT 429 (IAC) it was  held
    that in disputed age  assessments  the  duty  on  the  Tribunal  is  to
    consider the evidence as a whole, including documentary evidence relied
    upon, even where there are a number of documents produced purporting to
    verify the claimed age. The Claimant  in  this  case  has  produced  no
    documents in support to verify his age. He has been  found  not  to  be
    credible in respect of the factual basis of his claim to be in need  of
    international protection. He was inconsistent  in  the  information  he
    provided to Warwickshire County Council having initially said that  his
    mother was 80 and his father 70 and then changing his  account  to  say
    that they were both 40. He then said he gave his grandparents  ages  as
    he thought it would be dangerous and he would be  handed  over  to  the
    police or Taliban and alternatively because he was confused.

17. In Rawofi (age assessment - standard of proof) [2012]  UKUT  00197(IAC)
    it was held that where age is disputed in  the  context  of  an  asylum
    appeal, the burden is on the appellant and the standard of proof is  as
    laid down in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department  Ex  parte
    Sivakumaran [1988] AC 958 and R (Karanakaran) v Secretary of State for
    the Home Department [2000] EWCA Civ 11.

18. I find that the Claimant has not  been  truthful  in  his  evidence  in
    relation to his age. I accept the Secretary of State's  age  assessment
    and his notional date of birth as  1  August  1998.  I  find  that  the
    Claimant has not demonstrated on the evidence before me that he was  as
    he claimed, 13 � on arrival due to  the  lack  of  credibility  of  his
    account and the absence of any positive probative evidence  in  respect
    of his age from him. However, in assessing  risk,  I  take  account  of
    Maurice Kay LJ's observations in KA (Afghanistan) v Secretary of  State
    for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 1014, [2013] 1  WLR  615,  para
    18, namely, that when it comes  to  the  kinds  of  risk  such  as  the
    forcible  recruitment  or  the  sexual  exploitation  of  young  males,
    "persecution is not respectful of birthdays". Sir Stanley Burton in  EU
    (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013]  EWCA
    Civ 32, [2013]  Imm  AR  496  added  to  the  court's  comments  in  KA
    (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012]  EWCA
    Civ 1014, [2013] 1 WLR 615, about the boundary  line  between  minority
    and adulthood that since the date of birth given is often notional, the
    fact that the true date of birth is unknown is an additional reason for
    not regarding the supposed date of majority as necessarily changing the
    assessment of risk.

19. I turn firstly to the Secretary of State's duty to trace the Claimant's
    family. Mr Azmi alleges that the Secretary of State has failed  in  her
    duty to trace  the  Claimant's  family.  He  asserts  in  his  skeleton
    argument that the Claimant has provided as much information as he could
    in respect of his family members and has completed a family tracing pro-
    forma and sought the services of the Red Cross.

20. In respect of the duty to trace, the following passages of the  Supreme
    Court Judgement in TN (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department;  AA  (Afghanistan)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department;  MA  (Afghanistan)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2015] UKSC 40 per Lord Toulson are relevant to this appeal:



         "70.     I turn next to Ravichandran and Rashid. The  principle  in
         Ravichandran is sound. As Simon Brown, LJ said in that case, on  an
         asylum appeal the subject matter is whether the appellant  requires
         refugee protection. The function of the court is quite  unlike  its
         function when adjudicating, for example, on a private law claim for
         breach of contract or tort. A claimant who establishes  that  there
         has been a breach of contract or tort is entitled to be put, so far
         as the court is able to do so, in the same position as if the wrong
         had not been committed. In Ravichandran the court rightly held that
         on an asylum appeal the question is one of present status: does the
         appellant meet the criteria of the Refugee Convention or is  he  in
         need of humanitarian protection?

         71.      I agree with the criticisms made of Rashid by Carnwath  LJ
         in R(S) v Secretary of State for Home Department and by Sir Stanley
         Burnton in EU (Afghanistan) v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department. In Rashid the sloppiness  of  procedures  in  the  Home
         Office resulted in the  appellant  being  unfairly  denied  refugee
         status when he applied for it; but refugee status is not  bound  to
         endure for ever. By the time that his case  reached  the  Court  of
         Appeal the source of persecution in Iraq had been  overthrown,  and
         the effect of the court's decision was to give him a right which he
         did not need  for  his  personal  protection.  Because  the  Rashid
         exception to Ravichandran lacks a  satisfactory  principle,  it  is
         also impossible to state its scope with any degree of  clarity.  In
         KA (Afghanistan) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
         Maurice Kay LJ (para 17) described it as a  "complicated  question"
         whether the facts of the cases under consideration gave rise to the
         Rashid principle,  and  the  court  struggled  in  its  attempt  to
         articulate what needed to be shown for the principle to apply.

         72.      I would hold that the Ravichandran  principle  applies  on
         the hearing of asylum appeals without exception, and Rashid  should
         no longer be followed. The question whether the appellant qualifies
         for asylum status is not a question of discretion. It is one  which
         must be decided on the evidence before the tribunal or  court,  and
         there is no legal justification for approaching that question  with
         a presumption that the appellant is credible arising from a failure
         of the respondent properly to discharge her obligation in  relation
         to family tracing. Discretionary leave  by  definition  involves  a
         discretion, but it is a discretion which belongs to the  respondent
         and not to the court. The respondent must of  course  exercise  her
         discretion lawfully, with proper regard to any policy which she has
         established, but I agree with Sir Stanley Burnton that  it  is  not
         proper for a court to require the respondent to grant unconditional
         leave to an appellant who would not  be  entitled  to  such  relief
         under current policy (or have a current right to remain in  the  UK
         on other grounds, such as article 8), as a form of  relief  for  an
         earlier error or breach of obligation.

         73.       There  remains  the  question  how  the  tribunal  should
         approach an asylum appeal where the respondent has  failed  in  her
         tracing obligation. If the appellant believes that he may have been
         prejudiced, it would be open  to  him  to  ask  the  respondent  to
         attempt to carry out a tracing process and to ask the  tribunal  to
         adjourn the appeal for that to be done. There would be force in the
         argument that it should not make a difference whether the appellant
         has by then turned 18, since that would not  remove  an  obligation
         which had arisen under the Reception Directive and the  effects  of
         which were intended to last beyond their minority (as the  OCC  has
         submitted). However, in deciding whether it accepts the appellant's
         account, the tribunal must act on the evidence  which  it  has.  In
         that respect I  agree  with  what  was  said  by  Lloyd  LJ  in  DS
         (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (set out
         at para 43 above). If the appellant has identified people who might
         be able to confirm his account, but the respondent has not  pursued
         that  lead,  the  tribunal  might  fairly  regard  the  appellant's
         willingness to identify possible sources of corroboration as a mark
         of credibility, but this would be an evidential assessment for  the
         tribunal. There is no presumption of credibility."

21. The Respondent set out at paragraph 56 of the refusal letter what steps
    were taken to trace the Claimant's family. The Respondent comments that
    the British Embassy in Kabul does not currently have  the  facility  to
    carry out tracing  of  the  families  of  unaccompanied  children  from
    Afghanistan. No results were found on Home Office  databases  from  the
    information the Claimant provided. The Secretary of  State  noted  that
    the Claimant was last in contact with his  mother  in  Afghanistan  and
    with his uncle during his visit to the UK. No results were  found  from
    search engines and the Claimant had no family in the UK.

22. I do not consider that it can be  said  that  the  Secretary  of  State
    failed in her duty to trace the Claimant's family. She  acted  on  what
    evidence was provided. It does not appear on  the  evidence  before  me
    that the Claimant provided an exact  address  in  Afghanistan  for  his
    family home and in any event it was his claim, which was  not  accepted
    as credible, that his family home was set on fire and  his  mother  and
    siblings had gone to live in Kunduz City with his uncle.

23. In AA (unattended children) Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 00016 (IAC)  the
    Tribunal held that (i) The evidence before the Tribunal does not  alter
    the position as described in HK and  Others  (minors  -  indiscriminate
    violence - forced recruitment by Taliban - contact with family members)
    Afghanistan CG [2010] UKUT 378 (IAC), namely that when considering  the
    question of whether children are  disproportionately  affected  by  the
    consequences of the armed conflict in Afghanistan, a distinction has to
    be drawn between children who were living with a family and  those  who
    are not.  That  distinction  has  been  reinforced  by  the  additional
    material before this Tribunal.  Whilst it is recognised that there  are
    some risks to which children who will have the protection of the family
    are nevertheless subject, in particular the risk of landmines  and  the
    risks of being trafficked, they are not of such a level as to  lead  to
    the conclusion  that  all  children  would  qualify  for  international
    protection.  In arriving at this conclusion, account has been taken  of
    the necessity to  have  regard  to  the  best  interests  of  children.
    However, the background evidence demonstrates that unattached  children
    returned to Afghanistan, depending upon their individual  circumstances
    and the location to which they are returned, may be exposed to risk  of
    serious  harm,  inter  alia  from   indiscriminate   violence,   forced
    recruitment, sexual  violence,  trafficking  and  a  lack  of  adequate
    arrangements for child protection.  Such risks will have  to  be  taken
    into account when addressing the question of whether a return is in the
    child's best interests, a  primary  consideration  when  determining  a
    claim to humanitarian protection.

24. The Claimant maintains that he is an unattached child and that  he  has
    been unable to contact his family in Afghanistan. He has  produced  two
    letters from the British Red Cross dated 11 January 2016 and  6  August
    2015. The first letter confirms an appointment and the second says that
    the efforts to locate the Claimant's relative is continuing but at  the
    present time there is no information. No details are  provided  of  the
    information given to them by the Claimant  nor  has  he  produced  that
    evidence elsewhere. He has not produced any evidence to  show  that  he
    has tried to contact his uncle with whom said he had stayed  in  Kunduz
    or people in his home village who could know where his family is.   The
    letter confirming his appointment with the Red Cross is  postdates  the
    Secretary of State's grant of permission to appeal the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

25. In EU Sir Stanley Burton made the following comment:

         "10.     I should mention a point made by the  Secretary  of  State
         which I consider to  have  substance.  Unaccompanied  children  who
         arrive in this country from Afghanistan have done so as a result of
         someone, presumably their families, paying for  their  fare  and/or
         for a so-called agent to arrange their journey to this country. The
         costs incurred by the family will have been considerable,  relative
         to the wealth of the average  Afghan  family.  The  motivation  for
         their incurring that cost may be that their child faces risk if  he
         or she remains with them in Afghanistan, or it may simply  be  that
         they believe that their child will  have  a  better  life  in  this
         country. Either way, they are unlikely to  be  happy  to  cooperate
         with an agent of the Secretary of State for  the  return  of  their
         child  to  Afghanistan,  which  would  mean  the  waste  of   their
         investment in his or her journey here."

26. The Claimant has been found to give in incredible account. I find  that
    the Claimant's family is likely to have spent  a  considerable  sum  in
    order to get him here. I have taken account of the  evidence  submitted
    by the Claimant in his bundle and supplementary bundle in  relation  to
    the brief take-over of Kunduz by the Taliban in September 2015  and  in
    relation to the Chardara District where the Claimant stated  he  lived.
    According  to  a  document  from  3  January  2016   entitled   "Afghan
    biographies" at page 53  of  the  bundle  the  Taliban  insurgency  has
    regained strength and  now  controls  much  of  the  area  outside  the
    district centre. According to the background information in relation to
    Kunduz city the government forces recaptured the city  in  mid-October.
    Throughout the Taliban occupation of Kunduz city, an estimated  150,000
    residents  remained  in  their  homes  and  the  violence  led  to  the
    displacement of over 13,000 families to different parts of the country.
    From the start of the Taliban attack on 28 September until  13  October
    when they withdrew there were 848 civilian casualties.

27. It is not the Claimant's case that he  lost  contact  with  his  family
    during the conflict. According to his account his uncle  spoke  to  him
    through the agent during his journey to the UK but he  stated  that  he
    did not have his number to contact him and there has  been  no  contact
    since. I do not accept his evidence that he is not in contact with  his
    family. He did not flee Afghanistan in fear for his life and  in  light
    of his family's financial investment in his journey to the  UK  I  find
    that that he remains in contact with his family who are  likely  to  be
    able to meet him in  Kabul  on  return.  I  find  that  he  is  not  an
    unattached child but a young adult who  has  not  shown  to  the  lower
    standard that he does not have contact with his  family  and  therefore
    does not have a well-founded fear of persecution in Afghanistan.

28. In AK (Article 15(c))  Afghanistan  CG  [2012]  UKUT  00163  (IAC)  the
    Tribunal held  that  the  country  guidance  given  in  AA  (unattended
    children) Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 00016 (IAC), insofar as it relates
    to unattended children, remains unaffected by its decision.  The  Upper
    Tribunal found that despite a rise in the number of civilian deaths and
    casualties and (particularly in the 2010-2011 period) an  expansion  of
    the geographical scope of the armed conflict in Afghanistan, the  level
    of indiscriminate violence in that country taken as a whole was not  at
    such a high level as to mean that, within the meaning of Article  15(c)
    of the Qualification Directive, a civilian, solely by being present  in
    the country, faces a real risk which threatens his life or person.  Nor
    was the level of indiscriminate violence, even in the  provinces  worst
    affected by the violence (which may now be taken to include Ghazni  but
    not to include Kabul), at such a level. Whilst when assessing  a  claim
    in the context of Article 15(c) in which the  respondent  asserts  that
    Kabul city would be a viable internal  relocation  alternative,  it  is
    necessary  to  take  into  account  (both  in  assessing  "safety"  and
    reasonableness") not only the level of violence in that city  but  also
    the difficulties experienced by that city's  poor  and  also  the  many
    Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) living there, these  considerations
    will not in general  make  return  to  Kabul  unsafe  or  unreasonable.
    Nevertheless, this position is qualified (both in relation to Kabul and
    other potential places of internal relocation) for  certain  categories
    of women. The purport of the current Home Office OGN on Afghanistan  is
    that whilst women with a male support network may be able  to  relocate
    internally, "...it would be  unreasonable  to  expect  lone  women  and
    female heads of household to relocate internally" (February  2012  OGN,
    3.10.8) and the Tribunal sees no basis for taking a different view.

29. In R (on the application of Nasire) v Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department [2010] EWHC 3359 (Admin) Laing QC held  that  the  level  of
    indiscriminate violence was not so high that any civilian would  be  at
    risk in Afghanistan.

30. I have had careful regard to the evidence submitted by the Claimant  in
    relation to  the  question  of  whether  the  generalised  violence  in
    Afghanistan as a whole crosses the Article 15  (c)  threshold.  I  find
    that it does not. Nor  do  I  consider  that  there  are  any  personal
    circumstances in relation to the Claimant which enhance his  risk  such
    that he has an individual relevant characteristic and can show  a  real
    risk under Article 15 (c). I accept that there has been a  recent  high
    level of violence in Kunduz city but find  that  it  would  neither  be
    unsafe or unreasonable for the Claimant to return to Kabul as  a  young
    adult in good health with no vulnerabilities who  has,  I  have  found,
    retained contact with  his  family.   The  evidence  submitted  by  the
    Claimant does not persuade me  that  the  country  guidance  should  be
    departed from according to the principles  set  out  in  DSG  &  Others
    (Afghan Sikhs: departure from CG) Afghanistan [2013] UKUT (IAC).

31. Given my findings above I further find that  he  has  not  demonstrated
    that there would be very significant obstacles to his integration  into
    Afghanistan as required by paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.

Conclusions:

I remake the decision in this appeal by dismissing it on all grounds.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made an order and I continue  that  order  (pursuant
to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008).  Unless
and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise,  the  Claimant  is  granted
anonymity.  No report of these  proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly
identify him or any member of his family.  This direction  applies  both  to
the Claimant and to the Secretary of State.  Failure  to  comply  with  this
direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
