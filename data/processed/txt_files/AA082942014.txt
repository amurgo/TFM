Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr G Hodgetts instructed by McGarvey Immigration &
                    Asylum Practitioners Limited
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            REMITTAL AND REASONS

 1. This appeal is subject to an anonymity order by the First-tier Tribunal
    pursuant to Rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal
    (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230).   Neither  party  invited  me  to
    rescind the order and I continue it pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698).

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Iran who was born on 22 March  1973.   He
    arrived in the UK on  17  October  2013  and  claimed  asylum.   On  23
    September 2014, the appellant's asylum claim  was  refused  and  on  26
    September 2014 a decision was made to refuse him leave  to  enter  with
    removal directions proposed to Iran.

 3. The appellant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The  appeal  was
    heard by Judge Andrew on 26 November 2014 and on 16 February 2015.   In
    a decision promulgated on 24 February 2015, Judge Andrew dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal on asylum and humanitarian  protection  grounds  and
    under Arts 2, 3 and 8 of  the  ECHR.   Judge  Andrew  made  an  adverse
    credibility finding and  rejected  the  appellant's  claim  based  upon
    political opinion.

 4. The appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  challenging  the  judge's
    adverse credibility finding.

 5. On 23 March 2015, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Cruthers) granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal.

 6. Thus, the appeal came before me.

 7. At the outset of the hearing, Mr Mills, who represented the respondent,
    accepted that the judge's decision could not stand.  He  accepted  that
    the  judge  had  materially  erred  in  law  in  reaching  her  adverse
    credibility finding.  First, he accepted that the judge had  failed  to
    take into account a number of documents relied upon by the appellant to
    establish his political activity in Iran.  At para 20,  the  judge  had
    said that "no such documents have  been  provided  to  me".   Mr  Mills
    accepted that those documents  were,  in  fact,  contained  within  the
    appellant's bundle.

 8. Secondly, Mr Mills accepted that the judge had been wrong in para 32 of
    her determination, in assessing the appellant's political  activity  in
    Iran, that his political comments in favour  of  the  "Green  Movement"
    were irrelevant as the "Green  Movement"  had  succeeded  in  the  2013
    elections.  Mr Mills accepted that that the Judge  had  been  wrong  to
    believe that was the case.

Decision and Disposal

 9. On that basis, and in the light of the respondent's concession that the
    judge's decision contained material errors of law and cannot  stand,  I
    set aside that determination  and  remit  the  appeal  for  a  de  novo
    rehearing before the First-tier Tribunal to be heard by a  judge  other
    than Judge Andrew.



                                                                      Signed

                                                                     A Grubb
                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal
