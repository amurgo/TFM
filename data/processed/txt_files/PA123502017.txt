Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Parkin, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms S Cunha, HOPO


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant has been granted permission to  appeal  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Feeney  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    respondent's refusal on 13 November 2017 to grant  him  asylum  in  the
    United Kingdom.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 2 March 1983.

3.   He arrived in the UK in October 2009  having  been  granted  a  student
    visa which was due to expire on 25 February 2013.  On 20 February  2013
    he applied for an EEA residence card as he claimed to be  dependent  on
    his cousin who had  EEA  residency.   His  claim  was  rejected  on  10
    December 2013 and he did not attend the appeal hearing scheduled  on  9
    June 2014.  On 1 August 2014 he applied under the  family  and  private
    life Rules but this claim was rejected on 29 October 2014 as he  failed
    to enrol his biometrics.  A further application  was  submitted  on  28
    November 2014 but this was rejected on 29 January 2015 with no right of
    appeal.  On 2 November 2015 he made a  further  application  for  leave
    under the family and private life Rules but this  was  rejected  on  25
    November 2015.  He claimed asylum on 15 May 2017.

4.   The appellant  claimed  that  he  is  gay  and  if  he  is  removed  to
    Bangladesh he will suffer inhuman and degrading treatment.  He fears he
    will be prosecuted in Bangladesh because he  is  gay.   The  respondent
    rejected his claim that he was gay for  the  reasons  set  out  in  the
    respondent's Reasons for Refusal Letter.

5.   The judge rejected the appellant's  claim  that  he  was  gay  for  the
    reasons set out at paragraphs 30 to 42.  The judge  also  rejected  his
    claim under Article 8 of the ECHR for reasons set out at paragraphs  43
    to 47.  At paragraph  48  the  judge  concluded  that  the  appellant's
    removal would not cause the UK to be in breach of its obligations under
    the Qualification Regulations.

6.   Mr Parkin submitted that there were two  errors  of  law  made  by  the
    judge; the first was the undue weight the judge attached to  the  delay
    in claiming asylum; and the second was the failure by the judge to give
    adequate reasons as to credibility.

7.   Taking the second ground first, Mr Parkin submitted that  at  paragraph
    36 the judge merely said that she had  taken  into  account  copies  of
    extracts from social media and Grindr,  but  also  bore  in  mind  that
    anyone can become a member and post photographs, as well as participate
    in chats.  Mr Parkin argued that it is not the existence of the  social
    media account but the purpose for which it is used.  In the appellant's
    bundle from page 105 to page 157, there were months of contact  between
    the appellant and other social media users making arrangements to meet.
     At page 155 he has a dating profile.  This evidence and  the  evidence
    at page 156 does not leave much room for doubt.  Mr  Parkin  said  that
    this evidence was directed to  the  judge's  attention.   He  said  the
    contents of communication should have led to the significant  inference
    that the appellant is gay.  It is fairly  compelling  evidence  of  his
    sexual orientation.  He submitted  that  in  reducing  the  credibility
    attached to that evidence,  the  judge  papered  over  the  appellant's
    social media account and gave it no consideration and no  weight.   The
    judge failed to  give  reason  why  no  weight  was  attached  to  this
    evidence.

8.   On this issue, I accept Ms Cunha's submission that although  the  judge
    did not go into too much detail  about  the  appellant's  social  media
    account, that account does not prove that the appellant  is  gay.   The
    fact that the judge attached little weight to it  does  not  materially
    undermine her decision in respect of the other matters  the  judge  had
    considered.

9.   At paragraph 30 the judge took into account the  appellant's  responses
    about how he first became aware of his sexuality.  The judge found that
    there was limited explanation as to how his relationship with  J  began
    given that both were aware that being gay was  a  criminal  offence  in
    Bangladesh.  The appellant explained that other friends were  aware  of
    the  couple's  sexuality  and  he  explained  that   they   were   also
    participants in their sex games.  Whenever asked about why he  did  not
    have any other relationships after J left, the appellant explained that
    he was afraid of being found out.  The judge said this was inconsistent
    with the fact that he  was  able  to  have  sexual  relationships  with
    others, in his own home, albeit while his parents were  away  and  that
    his friends were aware of his sexuality.

10.  The judge said the appellant  provided  a  witness  statement  from  MK
    dated 19 September 2017 and a witness statement from a Mr  H  dated  14
    May 2017.  The statements both said the appellant was gay.   The  judge
    said MK provided limited explanation as to how he  knew  the  appellant
    was gay.  Mr H explained that he met the appellant in a gay  bar.   The
    judge said that both witnesses did not attend to give evidence  at  the
    hearing.  In any event she noted that when the appellant was  asked  at
    the interview he was unable to name these witnesses.   He  referred  to
    one of the  witnesses  as  Sajjad  and  explained  that  this  was  his
    nickname.  He referred to the other witness as Murad.

11.  At paragraph 33 the judge took into account  the  letters  provided  by
    the appellant in support of his claim.   He  provided  an  e-mail  from
    ELOP.  It said the appellant was a member of ELOP and first attended on
    18 April 2015.  He is recorded as having attended  two  sessions.   The
    judge noted that the author of  the  e-mail  did  not  attend  to  give
    evidence.  The e-mail itself simply confirmed membership  of  a  group.
    It did not describe the appellant's involvement in that group.  The  e-
    mail did not comment on the appellant's sexuality.

12.  The judge also had a letter before her  from  NAZ  dated  19  September
    2017.  It confirmed that the appellant is a NAZ service user;  that  he
    first accessed their services in May 2015, that he has  been  attending
    one-to-one support sessions and support groups for south Asian gay  and
    bisexual men.  The letter stated that the appellant identifies as a gay
    man and the author believed this to be true.  The judge said the author
    of the letter did not attend the hearing to give evidence.  The  author
    did not explain on what  basis  he  reached  his  conclusion  that  the
    appellant is gay.  He  has  not  identified  how  often  the  appellant
    attended any support sessions or outreach stalls.  The judge  said  the
    provenance of this information was unclear.  He did not say whether the
    author was reporting information in his personal knowledge, whether the
    information was given to him by the appellant or whether he has  spoken
    to other members or organisers  at  the  support  groups  and  outreach
    stalls.  The judge reduced the weight she attached to this letter as  a
    consequence.

13.  At paragraph 35 the judge said she had taken into  account  the  letter
    dated 9 October 2018 from Reverend K.  The judge acknowledged  that  he
    has worked within the Bangladesh community in London and  that  he  has
    been to Bangladesh as a guest of the Bangladesh Government  and  he  is
    aware of the strong opposition towards  being  gay.   He  provided  the
    appellant with  a  character  reference.   He  also  said  that  having
    monitored, counselled and some personal activities with him over  three
    years, he was assured that the appellant is a gay man.   The  appellant
    claimed that Reverend K is  openly  gay  and  that  the  appellant  has
    attended his home for "sexual activities".  The judge said that if this
    was the case then it is unclear why  Reverend  Kiddle  would  not  have
    explained  the  true  nature  of  their  relationship  in  his  witness
    statement or in his letter.  The judge said the  witness  statement  of
    Reverend K appears to have based his conclusions on  questions  he  has
    asked the appellant.  Again, Reverend K did not attend the  hearing  to
    clarify the position.  The judge said she  was  told  that  he  is  now
    disabled and could not attend.  Although  she  took  into  account  the
    letter in support, she again reduced the weight she attached to it  for
    the reasons given by her.

14.  Mr Parkin acknowledged that at paragraph 37 where the judge  refers  to
    the provisions of Section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of
    Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, the judge did  say  that  Section  8  was  a
    factor  to  take  into  account  in  her  overall  assessment  of   the
    appellant's credibility.  Mr Parkin relied on JT  (Cameroon)  to  argue
    that Section 8 matters were given a status and a compartment  of  their
    own, rather than taken into account as part of a global  assessment  of
    credibility.

15.  Mr Parkin referred to the judge's findings at paragraph 38 to 40.   The
    judge held as follows:

         "38. I take into account that the appellant did  not  claim  asylum
             until 2017. He told me  that  he  did  not  submit  an  asylum
             application at an earlier stage as he was  not  aware  he  was
             able to make an asylum application on the basis of gay  sexual
             orientation. I do not accept this as  a  credible  explanation
             for the following reasons.

             a)   The appellant is not na�ve and uneducated. He is somebody
                  who has come to the United Kingdom as a student and  as  a
                  result of the  various  immigration  applications  he  has
                  made, he is familiar with immigration procedures.

             b)   Further, he claims to have engaged in organisations where
                  he  would  have  had  contact  with  others   in   similar
                  situations. It is likely that he would not have  discussed
                  his situation with them and it is unlikely he  would  have
                  been ignorant of the help he could receive.

             c)   He had the benefit of legal advice in the course  of  his
                  previous applications.

             d)    The  appellant  was  well   aware   of   the   potential
                  consequences attached to being gay in Bangladesh.  It  was
                  clear to him that returning would not have  been  possible
                  in the circumstances and I note  that  during  his  asylum
                  interview he said that when he arrived in the UK  he  knew
                  he could not return to Bangladesh.

             e)   In submitting his human rights, application it would have
                  been obvious that this was a factor that  could  influence
                  the  respondent's  decision  and  that  could  affect  his
                  return. However, he does not refer to it.

         39.  I have considered the guidance provided by the Home Office  on
             dealing with  claims  based  on  sexual  orientation.  In  his
             witness statement the appellant claims  that  he  was  feeling
             ashamed and degraded in claiming asylum. However, when he  was
             asked why he didn't claim asylum during his interview, he said
             that he had status as a student. The rest of his  response  is
             incomprehensible. He told me during the hearing that he didn't
             know he was allowed to claim asylum. I find this is not a case
             where the appellant has found it  difficult  to  come  forward
             about his sexuality. His reasons for failing to  claim  asylum
             have differed over time. Further,  since  2015  at  least,  he
             claims he had actively engaged in the gay club scene, NAZ  and
             other gay support networks. Even if, when the  appellant  came
             to the UK, he was  reluctant  to  disclose  his  sexuality  no
             reasonable explanation has been provided as to why he did  not
             discuss his fears with the respondent in 2015.

         40.  The appellant did not have just one opportunity to  alert  the
             respondent to his fears.  He had contact with  the  respondent
             over many years and he made multiple  applications.  One  such
             application was on the basis of  his  relationship  with  Jone
             Saveikyte, a Lithuanian  national.  On  16  October  2015  the
             respondent wrote to the appellant solicitors, ACM  Immigration
             Experts Limited (during the hearing he  confirmed  that  those
             solicitors were acting on his behalf at  the  relevant  time).
             The letter invites the solicitors to submit  evidence  of  the
             appellant's family and private life. The appellant replied  to
             that letter on 18 April 2016 to assert he had family life with
             his  partner  Ms  Saveikyte.  However,  he  says  he  had   no
             involvement in the application. I bear in mind  that  although
             the letter is in his name he has not signed it  and  I  factor
             this into my analysis."

16.  Mr Parkin accepted that the judge looked  at  other  evidence  but  his
    main submission was that the judge attached less weight  to  the  other
    evidence, namely at paragraph 30 where she found that the appellant was
    vague about how his relationship with  J  developed,  at  paragraph  34
    there was no oral evidence by the author from NAZ and no oral  evidence
    by Reverend K.  Mr Parkin submitted  that  what  was  lacking  was  any
    reasoning as to why these pieces of evidence though  not  corroborative
    to a significant  degree  amounted  to  reasons  for  disbelieving  the
    appellant's account.  He submitted that delay was the  judge's  primary
    reason for refusing the appellant's account.

17.  Ms Cunha submitted that  the  judge's  assessment  of  the  appellant's
    credibility was adequate, balanced and an overarching assessment.   The
    judge did not attach undue weight to the  delay  by  the  appellant  in
    claiming asylum.  The judge addressed  the  reasons  why  delay  was  a
    factor in her assessment of the appellant's credibility.

18.  I do not find that the judge gave undue weight  to  the  delay  by  the
    appellant in claiming asylum.   One  has  to  bear  in  mind  that  the
    appellant had made various other applications since the expiry  of  his
    student visa on 25 February 2013.  He did not claim asylum until  2017.
    It appears to me as did the judge that the  asylum  claim  was  a  last
    resort, following rejection of the various applications he had made.

19.  Indeed,  at  paragraph  41  the  judge  noted  that  Ms  Saveikyte  had
    submitted the application to help him.  No reasonable  explanation  had
    been provided as to why she would falsely claim to be in a relationship
    with him.  Ms  Saveikyte  did  not  attend  the  hearing  to  offer  an
    explanation.  In the light of the evidence the judge  concluded  in  my
    view a conclusion that was open to  her  that  the  application  was  a
    further attempt by the appellant to stay in the  UK  and  this  further
    undermined his credibility.

20.  Looking at all the evidence that the judge  had  to  consider,  I  find
    that her treatment of Section 8 as a factor and the  reasons  given  by
    the judge at paragraphs 38 to 40 did not amount to undue  weight  given
    by the judge to Section 8.  I find  that  at  paragraph  42  the  judge
    neatly summed up her findings.

         "42. I  take  into  account  the  findings  I  made  regarding  the
             appellant's evidence about his gay experiences in  Bangladesh.
             I take into account, in his favour the letter from NAZ and the
             Rev Kiddle, although I reduce  the  weight  I  attach  to  the
             letters for reasons set out above. I bear in mind the extracts
             from social media, although I note it is  open  to  anyone  to
             create  a  Grindr  account.  I  take  into  account  that  the
             appellant did not claim asylum on arrival in the  UK  and  did
             not tell the respondent that he  was  gay  when  he  submitted
             leave  to  remain  applications.  I conclude  no  reasonable
             explanation has been provided for these omissions and  I find
             them as damaging to the appellant's credibility  in  terms  of
             the 2004 Act. Looking at the evidence  overall,  I  find  this
             appellant is not a witness of truth. I find his claim  to  be
             gay is contrived  to  enable  him  to  remain  in  the  United
             Kingdom."

21.  I find that the judge's assessment of the appellant's  credibility  was
    adequate and balanced. I  find  that  the  judge's  decision  does  not
    disclose an error of law.

22.  The judge's decision dismissing the appellant's appeal shall stand.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
