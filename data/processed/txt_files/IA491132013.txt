Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr M Aslam, instructed by Whitefield Solicitors Ltd
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Azhar Mahmood, date of birth 4.4.70,  is  a  citizen  of
    Pakistan.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Bruce promulgated  2.4.14,  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    decisions of the respondent, on 22.10.13 to refuse his application  for
    indefinite leave to remain pursuant to paragraph 134 of the Immigration
    Rules, and on 4.11.13 to remove him from the UK pursuant to section  10
    of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. The Judge heard the  appeal  on
    1.4.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Zucker  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    28.4.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 18.11.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Bruce should be set aside.

 6. The lengthy history is summarised between �2 and �7 of the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal. It is the third decision of the  Secretary  of
    State to refuse ILR on 22.10.13 and on 4.11.13 to remove him  from  the
    UK.

 7. The grounds of appeal run to some 35 paragraphs and include submissions
    that the judge misunderstood the facts and applied guidance  which  did
    not apply.

 8. In  granting  permission  to  appeal,  Judge  Zucker  stated  that  the
    "cumulative effect of of the errors identified, if made out, mean  that
    it is arguable that the judge had materially erred. All grounds may  be
    argued."

 9. The issue  in  the  appeal  was  whether  the  appellant  met  all  the
    requirements of paragraph 134 of the Immigration Rules at the  date  of
    decision.  This paragraph sets out the requirements for ILR as  a  work
    permit holder, on the basis of having accumulated  5  years  continuous
    lawful residence, of which the latter part must be with leave as a work
    permit holder.

10. Judge Bruce found that whilst the appellant had completed 5 years,  his
    leave had expired at the date of his application by more than 28  days.
    The judge went on  to  consider  the  submissions  about  policy  which
    enabled a period in excess of 28 days  to  be  disregarded  in  certain
    circumstances, but found that the reasons for delay were not consistent
    with the policy. However, the requirement that the applicant  must  not
    be in breach of UK immigration laws was only inserted on 1.10.12,  with
    savings for applications made but not decided before  9.7.12.  Thus  at
    the date of application, there was no such requirement. However, at �12
    the judge noted that  the  parties  had  agreed  by  consent  that  the
    relevant version of Rule 134 to be applied was that  in  force  at  the
    date of decision. Having made such a concession, the judge  can  hardly
    be criticised for applying the version of  the  Rules  the  appellant's
    representative had agreed should be applied. However,  the  version  of
    Rule 134 applicable at date of decision includes the  saving  provision
    for  applications  made  but  not  decided  before   9.7.12.   In   the
    circumstances, it must follow that there is an error  of  law  on  this
    issue. The breach of immigration rules by overstaying should have  been
    disregarded. However, in the light of the other findings, this error is
    not material, as it would not have changed the outcome of the appeal.

11. The respondent's case is that the appellant's employment as a take-away
    chef does not fall within the definition of chef under  code  5434  and
    that it was not credible that the appellant was being paid at the  code
    of practice rate at the date of decision, 22.10.13. At  �16  the  judge
    agreed with this submission and did not accept that the  appellant  was
    genuinely paid at the rate  suggested;  finding  the  salary  had  been
    arranged to make it appear that the appellant is  earning  the  claimed
    salary when in fact he is giving most of it back to his employer.

12. In his submissions Mr Azlam referred me to  the  Statement  of  Intent:
    Codes of Practice for skilled workers, which sets out  that  code  5434
    applies to chefs, and  the  Tier  2  shortage  occupation  list,  dated
    16.3.11. His argument was  that  if  the  occupation  was  not  in  the
    shortage list, the appellant does not need a certificate of sponsorship
    (COS).

13. �10 of the grounds of application for permission  to  appeal  submitted
    that code 5434 is the only  code  applicable  to  chefs  and  that  the
    highest salary is required only if the employer is getting the  benefit
    of the shortage occupation list, or issuing a COS. It is submitted that
    the employer was not relying on the shortage occupation  list  and  did
    not issue a COS. Mr Azlam relied on the case of Philipson  (ILR  -  not
    PBS: evidence) India [2012] UKUT 00039 (IAC), which at  headnote  (iii)
    doubted  that  rule  134(iv)  applies  to  those  who  never  needed  a
    certificate of sponsorship with a salary level identified  in  guidance
    relating to such certificates. The appellant in that case  entered  the
    UK under the old system and not the new PBS one and  accordingly  never
    held a certificate of sponsorship.

14. In reply, Mr McVeety pointed  out  that  the  letter  accompanying  the
    application claimed that the appellant was employed in a shortage skill
    occupation.

15. Rule 134(iv) was inserted from 6.4.11, before the  appellant  made  his
    application on 16.6.11. The general rule on decisions on variations  of
    leave are that they are decided under the terms of the Rules  in  force
    at the date of decision, unless there is  any  transitional  or  saving
    provision. There were none such in relation to 134(iv), although  there
    are in relation to other parts of rule 134. Philipson is not  authority
    on the issue, as it is  clear  from  �14  that  the  Tribunal  was  not
    deciding that issue; hence why it was only "doubted" and no  ruling  on
    the issue was made. The Tribunal in fact proceeded  on  the  assumption
    that there was an appropriate salary rate for the claimant's job.

16. As noted above, the appellant's representative had agreed that Rule 134
    at  formulated  at  the  date  of  decision  contained   the   relevant
    requirements. Rule 134 does not specifically require a COS,  only  that
    the sponsoring employer certifies that the appellant is still  required
    for the employment in question and that he is  paid  at  or  above  the
    appropriate rate for the job  as  stated  in  the  codes  of  practice.
    However, 134(iv) does require the job to be paid at or above  the  rate
    for the job in the codes of practice.

17. The appropriate rate for the job is as set out in code 5434, depends on
    the kind of chef, of which there are 3: A skilled chef  as  defined  in
    the shortage occupation list;  a  new  entrant  chef;  and  other  chef
    (experienced). The shortage occupation list as of 16.3.11, which is the
    SOC, states that only the defined job will meet the code,  which  is  a
    skilled chef where, inter alia, the job is not in a fast food outlet or
    an establishment that provides a take-away service. The  appellant  was
    employed in a take-away establishment, as found by the judge, which  is
    outside the shortage occupation code. The SOC states that no other type
    of chef or cook comes within code 5434. In other words, a  new  entrant
    chef or other experienced chef does not meet the requirements  of  Rule
    134(iv). Even a skilled chef, where he is earning less than �28,260  or
    working in a take-away or fast food establishment, does  not  meet  the
    requirements of rule  134(iv).   On  the  findings  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal the appellant failed on both limbs of this requirement. I find
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal on this issue  at  �17,  to  be
    correct, and inevitably, the appeal could not succeed for  the  reasons
    stated. Any error as to  the  actual  salary  level  required  was  not
    material, as the judge found, for good reasons  that  his  true  salary
    fell far short.

18. The grounds also submit that the appeal should have been allowed  under
    article 8 ECHR. It is clear that the appellant did not  claim  to  have
    any family life in the UK. In respect of private life between  �20  and
    �22 the judge considered the  appellant's  private  life  claim,  first
    under  paragraph  276ADE  of   the   Immigration   Rules,   which   his
    representative conceded he could not meet,  and then outside the Rules.
    The judge proceeded in �20 to consider the question of proportionality,
    accepting for that purpose that the appellant had a  private  life  and
    that the decision to remove him would  be  an  interference  with  that
    private life sufficient to engage article 8(2) ECHR.

19. It is clear that the judge carefully considered  the  factors  for  and
    against  the  appellant  in  the  proportionality  balancing  exercise,
    including that he would have come to the UK with the intention and hope
    that his work permit would lead to settlement. However, it was doubtful
    that he ever worked in accordance with the terms of  his  leave  as  to
    salary level and thus could not have had any legitimate expectation  of
    being able to remain. In my view,  the  judge  reached  the  inevitable
    conclusion that the decision to remove him was not disproportionate  to
    the appellant's private life in the UK.

Conclusion & Decision:

20. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: the appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
