                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the  decision  of  Judge  Metzer
    made following a hearing at Taylor House on 22nd March 2013.



Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Turkey born on 15th March 1990.  He  came
    to the UK having been issued with a visitor/student  visa  valid  until
    6th June 2012.  A week before his visa expired he made an  application,
    on 31st May 2012 for leave to remain in the UK in  order  to  establish
    himself in business under  the  Turkey-European  Community  Association
    Agreement.  This contains a standstill clause which means that  the  UK
    may not impose conditions for business applicants less favourable  than
    were enforced  when  the  agreement  came  into  being  in  1973.   The
    application was therefore considered under paragraph 21 of HC 510.

 3. The Secretary of State refused the application  on  23rd  October  2012
    because she  was  not  satisfied  that  the  Appellant  had  a  genuine
    intention to establish in business as a Pedicab driver as claimed.  The
    Respondent did not believe that the Appellant had  carried  out  proper
    research, failing to provide details of other Pedicab drivers to obtain
    information as  to  individual  pricing  structures  and  the  services
    offered and how the Appellant intended to compete for  business,  which
    cast  doubt  on  the  Appellant's  preparations   for   the   proposal.
    Furthermore he had  not  shown  evidence  of  research  in  respect  of
    potential advertising methods and could  not  explain  figures  in  his
    business plan.

 4. The Respondent was not satisfied that the doctor's  letter  written  in
    support of the application was genuine  because  it  was  in  identical
    terms with another unconnected  applicant  who  lived  in  an  entirely
    different area.  Neither of the letters was  on  proper  letter  headed
    paper.  The timing of the application indicated  to  the  Secretary  of
    State that the Appellant was attempting to secure further leave in  the
    UK rather than through a genuine desire to establish in business  under
    the EC Turkey Association Agreement.

 5. Finally, the Respondent  was  not  satisfied  that  the  Appellant  had
    adequately demonstrated the origin of the funds in his account or  that
    he had complete control of them.

The Judge's Determination

 6. The judge, in a brief determination referred to the  reported  decision
    of Akinci [2012] UKUT 00266.  Whilst he accepted that  the  Appellant's
    father had provided him with sufficient funds to meet the cost  of  the
    purchase of a Pedicab safety helmet and  satellite  navigation  he  was
    also not satisfied that the business plan was  properly  researched  or
    how the projected earnings figure was arrived at.  He  noted  that  the
    Appellant had little or no command of English despite attending  a  six
    month course and there was no evidence to  suggest  that  he  knew  the
    streets of London well. He had no relevant previous experience  and  he
    did not accept that he would be able to meet the bills arising and  his
    living expenses. He concluded that the Appellant had not demonstrated a
    genuine intention to establish in the  business  as  proposed  or  that
    there was a genuine need for the Appellant's services and investment.



The Grounds of Application

 7. The Appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had ignored relevant evidence in reaching his decision.  The  Appellant
    had  produced  a  bundle  of  evidence  in  relation  to  pricing   and
    advertising options and had spoken to friends who were Pedicab  drivers
    and the prices were based on these conversations.

 8. Moreover the judge had failed to ask himself the right questions as set
    out in the case of Akinci.  He had provided the relevant  evidence  but
    in any event had only applied for an initial period of twelve months in
    order to set himself up in business and was not to  be  judged  in  the
    same light as a person who joined an existing business or,  having  had
    an initial period  of  time,  wished  to  stay  to  pursue  established
    business purposes.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Renton on 16th
    May 2013 for the reasons stated in the grounds.

10. On  11th  June  2013  the  Respondent  served  a  reply  defending  the
    determination and stating that the  judge  was  entitled  to  find  the
    Appellant's research to be extremely limited.  Alternatively  his  lack
    of English, given the nature of the business was itself  sufficient  to
    dismiss the appeal.

Submissions

11. Miss Daykin relied on her grounds.  She submitted  that  there  was  an
    extensive bundle of evidence provided by  the  Appellant  which  showed
    evidence  of  his  research  into  the  business,  not  been   properly
    considered by the judge, who  had  ignored  the  oral  and  documentary
    evidence. For example, at paragraph 8 of the  determination  the  judge
    had said that the Appellant's  plan  was  to  charge  �5.00  per  hour,
    eventually upping it to �8.00 per hour but, according to  the  business
    plan the intention was to charge at �5.00-�8.00 per mile. The Appellant
    had provided evidence to show that he had knowledge  of  the  business.
    In particular she directed me to details of sightseeing tours and their
    prices which the Appellant had provided in the bundle.   The  Appellant
    had spoken to a number of individuals in the  industry  and  had  given
    evidence before the judge which it was incumbent on him  to  take  into
    account.  There was no requirement of any particular form  of  evidence
    or for corroboration of what the Appellant said.

12. With respect to the Appellant's command of  English,  he  had  provided
    evidence to show that he had done a course but in any event  his  level
    of English was sufficient for the purpose  of  the  business  since  he
    would be depending on  a  satellite  navigation  system.   He  was  not
    holding himself out as a tour guide.

13. Mr Bramble acknowledged that the determination was short but  submitted
    that the judge had considered all of the key components of the Rule and
    had reached a decision open to him on the evidence.

14. He had noted the evidence in the Appellant's bundle and in the  witness
    statement.  The evidence of the Appellant's  research  was  thin.   The
    judge was correct to state that the plan emanated  from  the  Appellant
    alone and printout pages from the internet  did  not  assist  him.  The
    documents relied upon by Miss Daykin  simply  showed  that  there  were
    Pedicabs in London  doing  tourist  routes  but  there  was  no  actual
    research as to what they were charging. It was not  being  argued  that
    there were glaring omissions within this determination. With respect to
    his English the judge was entitled to find that it was inadequate.

Findings and Conclusions

15. Under Rule 21 of HC 510

         "People admitted as visitors may  apply  for  the  consent  of  the
         Secretary of State to their establishing themselves for the purpose
         of setting up in business, whether  on  their  own  account  or  as
         partners in a new or existing business.  Any such application is to
         be considered on merits.  Permission will depend  on  a  number  of
         factors, including evidence that the  applicant  will  be  devoting
         assets of his own to the business, proportional to his interest  in
         it, that he will be able to bear his share of any  liabilities  the
         business may incur, and that his  share  of  its  profits  will  be
         sufficient to support him and any dependants.  The applicant's part
         in the business must not amount to disguised employment and it must
         be  clear  that  he  will  not  have  to  supplement  his  business
         activities by employment for  which  a  work  permit  is  required.
         Where the applicant intends to join an existing  business  accounts
         should be produced to establish  its  financial  position  together
         with a written statement of the terms on which he is to enter  into
         it; evidence should be sought that he will  be  actively  concerned
         with its running and that there is a genuine need for his  services
         and investment.  Where the application is granted  the  applicant's
         stay may be extended for a period of up  to  twelve  months,  on  a
         condition restricting his freedom to  take  employment.   A  person
         admitted as a businessman in the first instance may be  granted  an
         appropriate extension of stay if the conditions set out  above  are
         still satisfied at the end of the period for which he was  admitted
         initially."

16. In this case the Appellant is intending to set up a  new  business  and
    therefore the requirements in relation to joining an existing  business
    do not apply to him.

17. In Akinci the Tribunal held, inter alia, that a business plan  must  be
    realistic having regard to the nature of the enterprise.

18. The judge was entitled to make criticisms of the  Appellant's  business
    plan.  Miss Daykin submitted  that  the  judge  had  misunderstood  the
    evidence as to the charging mechanism.  It is right  to  say  that  the
    business plan refers to the Appellant charging between �5.00 and  �8.00
    per mile.  However, in his witness statement the Appellant clearly said
    that, as indicated on his business plan,  he  had  calculated  that  he
    needed to be working every day for eight hours for �5.00 per hour.  His
    plan was to charge �5.00 and then to increase it to �8.00.   The  judge
    cannot be criticised for relying on the Appellant's own evidence in his
    witness statement.  Indeed  the  discrepancy  between  the  Appellant's
    evidence and that in his business plan in itself undermines  confidence
    in the Appellant's grasp of how it is intended that he should work.

19. Miss Daykin made reference to the Appellant's research but  in  reality
    he has simply provided copies of documents from  the  internet  showing
    sightseeing tour prices and a code of conduct for Pedicab drivers.  The
    judge was entitled to say that the Appellant's level  of  research  was
    limited.

20. As the Respondent stated in her reply, the fact that  the  judge  found
    that the Appellant did not speak English is in itself a real difficulty
    for the Appellant.  The judge found that he had little or  not  command
    of English despite attending a six month course.  He  did  not  take  a
    test at the end of the course and when asked a question in  English  to
    see if he could understand during the hearing, the Appellant was unable
    to respond.  Miss Daykin said that the Appellant was not  intending  to
    set himself up as a tour guide.  He would also have the  benefit  of  a
    satellite navigation system.  However without basic  English  he  would
    not be able to take instructions from potential customers as  to  where
    they wanted to go and what they wanted to see.

21. The question of the Appellant's credibility was raised in  the  refusal
    letter, namely the question of the doctor's letter, but  this  was  not
    addressed by the judge.  The omission is immaterial however since  this
    appeal fails on the issues of whether the business plan  is  realistic,
    having regard to the nature of the enterprise.  The judge was  entitled
    to find that the plan was ill-researched and in any event the Appellant
    has little or no command of English which would make his  work  in  the
    tourist industry virtually impossible.

22. There does not appear to be an issue as to the monies in the account in
    that the judge accepted that the Appellant's father  had  provided  him
    with funds.  However the presence of those funds in the account is  not
    sufficient to meet the requirement of the Rule.

23. The grounds amount to a disagreement with the decision.

Decision

24. The judge did not err in law and his decision stands.  The  Appellant's
    appeal is dismissed.
