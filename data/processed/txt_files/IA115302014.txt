Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr A Hussain, counsel acting on direct access
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Waqas Khan, date  of  birth  3.3.88,  is  a  citizen  of
    Pakistan.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Chohan promulgated 6.6.14,  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent to refuse his application  made  on  23.1.14
    for leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the basis of  family  life
    with a partner present and settled in the  UK.   The  Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 22.5.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth granted permission to appeal  on
    28.7.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 31.10.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Chohan should be set aside.

 6. In a single line granting  permission  to  appeal,  Judge  Hollingworth
    stated, "It is arguable that the proportionality exercise has not  been
    carried out on a sufficient basis."

 7. At the outset of the  hearing  before  me,  Mr  Hussain,  who  did  not
    represent the appellant at the First-tier  Tribunal,  sought  leave  to
    amend grounds of appeal to rely  on  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration
    Rules. For the reasons set out below I refused permission.

 8. The refusal decision of the Secretary of State considered Appendix FM R-
    LTRP, but found that the appellant had failed to  demonstrate  that  he
    had been living with Ms Green for at least 2 years prior to the date of
    application and that he had failed to provide  sufficient  evidence  to
    show that he was in  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  a
    partner. In the circumstances, EX1 did not  apply.  The  decision  also
    considered paragraph 276ADE, but concluded that the appellant  had  not
    shown that he had lost all ties to his home country, including  social,
    cultural and family.

 9. The grounds of appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  specifically  state
    that, "this application was based upon the Article 8 ECHR  Family  Life
    Rights of  the  appellant,  his  partner  and  her  son."  The  grounds
    contained  no  reference  whatsoever  to  the  Immigration  Rules.  The
    covering letter, dated 22.1.14, accompanying  the  application  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal makes no reference to  Appendix  FM  or  any  other
    aspect of the Immigration Rules.  Instead,  it  asserts  an  article  8
    family life.

10. At the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing the appellant was represented
    by Mr D Chalk of One Stop Immigration Service, who stated at the outset
    of the hearing that the appeal was in respect of article 8 family  life
    only. That is recorded at �9 of the determination and I have  seen  the
    judge's handwritten record of proceedings to the exact same effect.  Mr
    McVeety advised that the  Presenting  Officer's  note  of  the  hearing
    stated the same. I granted a brief adjournment to enable Mr Hussain  to
    speak with Mr Chalk by telephone, but the latter was reportedly  unable
    to recollect the hearing at all.

11. The skeleton argument drafted by Mr Chalk and presented to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge stated that the issue in the  appeal  was  "whether
    the decision of the Secretary of  State  constituted  an  unlawful  and
    disproportionate interference with  the  article  8  ECHR  family  life
    rights of all those affected by the decision."  The  skeleton  argument
    contains no reference to the Immigration Rules. In the circumstances, I
    am satisfied that the appellant did not  pursue  any  claim  under  the
    Immigration Rules at all, either in the grounds of  appeal  or  at  the
    hearing.

12. Furthermore, the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal, also  drafted
    by Mr Chalk, make no reference to  or  suggestion  that  the  appellant
    could meet any of the Immigration Rules. The grounds takes  issue  only
    with article 8 and the proportionality assessment.

13. I am satisfied that throughout the appeal  process  this  was  and  was
    intended to be an application made on the basis of family life  outside
    the Immigration Rules, relying the right to  respect  for  private  and
    family life under article 8 ECHR.  Prior  to  Mr  Hussain's  appearance
    before me, there was no application to amend the grounds of  appeal  or
    any suggestion that  the  appellant  might  meet  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

14. Mr Hussain asserts that the First-tier Tribunal Judge should  have,  of
    the judge's own volition, considered Appendix FM, and that, had he done
    so, the appeal should and would have been allowed under the Immigration
    Rules. Reliance is based on R-LTRP and the assertion that the appellant
    and his partner had lived together for two years prior to the  date  of
    application. The witness statement evidence does state that they met in
    June 2011 and a few months later began to live  together.  The  witness
    statements dated  15.5.14  and  22.5.14  state  that  they  have  lived
    together  as  partners  for  two  and  a  half  years.  At  �2  of  the
    determination it is also stated that the they have  been  together  for
    two and a  half  years.  The  application  was  made  on  23.1.14.  The
    complaint of the Secretary of State in the refusal  decision  was  that
    there was insufficient evidence that they had lived  together  for  two
    years, as claimed, the requirement being to show that as at the date of
    application. However, the issue begs  the  question  of  what  evidence
    there was other than the appellant's claim and that of his partner. The
    evidence in the appellant's bundle does not appear to address or assist
    with respect to this issue.

15. Mr Hussain next argued that had the judge realised that  the  appellant
    met the eligibility requirements he would have had to consider EX1  and
    whether there were insurmountable obstacles to family  life  continuing
    outside the UK, at which stage the appellant relies  on  his  partner's
    relationship and contact with her  child,  who  is  resident  with  the
    child's father.

16. However, we do not in fact know for what reason neither  the  appellant
    nor his representative did not pursue the claim under  the  Immigration
    Rules. It is not necessarily the case that the  two  year  cohabitation
    point was missed, it could, for example, have been a  recognition  that
    it  was  not  possible  to  demonstrate  insurmountable  obstacles   to
    continuing family life outside the UK.

17. What is clear is that none of these issues were raised before the First-
    tier  Tribunal.  The  hearing,  at  the  express  invitation   of   the
    appellant's representative considered only the article  8  family  life
    claim. In the circumstances of this case and as outlined  above,  I  do
    not accept that this was a Robinson obvious point that should have been
    identified and addressed by the First-tier Tribunal, despite  the  fact
    that nothing in the papers or the evidence or the  submissions  of  the
    appellant's representative raised Appendix FM at all.

18. There is case authority for this approach. In Sarkar  [2014]  EWCA  Civ
    195, the Court of Appeal held that  even  when  Article  8  is  in  the
    grounds of appeal, if no evidence is adduced and  no  submissions  made
    the Appellant can be taken to have abandoned it as a ground  of  appeal
    and the Judge does not err in  failing  to  deal  with  it.  I  see  no
    particular reason why the same principle should not apply  to  Appendix
    FM.


19. In the circumstances, I consider any claim under  Appendix  FM  can  be
    taken to have been abandoned, if ever made, and conclude  that  it  was
    far too late to raise Appendix FM  at  this  late  stage.  I  therefore
    refused permission to amend the grounds of appeal.

20. It remains open to the appellant to make a  fresh  application  relying
    specifically on Appendix FM, if he now believes that he qualifies. This
    is, of course, highly relevant to any argument as to error  of  law  in
    respect of article 8 proportionality. It can hardly be disproportionate
    to refuse to grant leave to remain on  the  basis  of  article  8  ECHR
    family life when the appellant is adamant that he  can  demonstrate  he
    meets the requirements of Appendix FM for leave to remain.

21. In relation to the issue raised in the grounds of appeal to  the  Upper
    Tribunal and in respect of which permission to appeal  was  granted,  I
    find as follows.

22. It  is  clear  from  the  determination  that  Judge  Chohan  found  no
    compelling circumstances in this case. It is debatable whether  in  the
    light of section 86 of the 2002 Act that was  sufficient  not  to  deal
    with article 8. However, the judge did go on to consider article 8 ECHR
    and applied the Razgar steps.

23. At �10 the judge found that the appellant had established  family  life
    with his partner in the UK. At �14 and �15 the judge found the decision
    potentially interfered with that family life so as to engage article 8,
    but that such interference was in accordance with  the  law,  i.e.  the
    legitimate and necessary aim of the state to protect the economic well-
    being of the UK by the application of immigration control.

24. Whilst the decision on proportionality is briefly set out in �15, it is
    clear that in conducting the proportionality balancing exercise between
    on the one hand the family life rights of the appellant  and  Ms  Green
    and on the other the public interest in removal, the  judge  took  into
    account that at the time of entering into a relationship with Ms  Green
    he had no lawful basis for being in the UK. He came as  a  student  and
    could have had no legitimate expectation of being able to  stay  except
    in accordance with the Immigration Rules. His leave expired on 25.11.11
    but rather than go home he embarked on a relationship  with  Ms  Green.
    They must be taken to have realised  that  any  such  relationship  was
    precarious and that the appellant  was  in  due  course  likely  to  be
    removed.

25. The judge took into account that the appellant has family  in  Pakistan
    and that following contact with  them,  they  did  not  object  to  his
    relationship with a Christian woman and thus the judge  concluded  that
    there would not be difficulties from his family on return to  Pakistan.
    The judge took into account that  Ms  Green  was  reluctant  to  go  to
    Pakistan, because of her son in the UK. The judge  also  bore  in  mind
    that there was no reason why the appellant could not return to Pakistan
    and make  an  application  for  settlement  from  there.  There  is  no
    particular reason why the appellant should be excused  compliance  with
    the financial requirements of the Immigration Rules for an  application
    for settlement in the UK.

26. Mr Hussain submits that the  decision  took  no  account  of  the  best
    interests of Ms Green's child pursuant to section 55. However, there is
    no evidence that this appellant has any relevant relationship with that
    child, who lives with his natural father, even though Ms Green may have
    regular contact with the child. There is no evidence in the appellant's
    bundle that addresses the best interests of the child or sets  out  any
    difficulty for that child if the appellant is removed. Ms Green has ILR
    and cannot be compelled to leave, thus whether she does so  or  not  is
    entirely a matter for her. The judge had to  assess  the  case  on  the
    rather slender evidence  presented  to  him  and  Mr  Hussain  has  not
    identified any part of the evidence that he  can  demonstrate  was  not
    taken into account.

27. In the circumstances, I find no error of  law  in  the  proportionality
    assessment made by Judge Chohan and on the circumstances  presented  to
    the judge can see little scope for any other conclusion.

28. I also mention in passing that even if the determination were set aside
    and remade, in respect of the assessment of the public interest in  any
    article 8 consideration, I would have  to  take  into  account  section
    117B(4) that little weight should be attached to a private  life  or  a
    relationship formed with a qualifying partner that is established by  a
    person at a time when the person is in the UK unlawfully.

Conclusions:

29. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
