For the Appellant:     Mr Mannam, instructed by J Stifford Law Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Avery, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Joyce Akosua Asantewaa, was born on 13 March 1966 and is
    a female citizen of Ghana.  She first entered  the  United  Kingdom  in
    2006 on a visit visa.  She returned with her then husband in  2007  but
    divorced him in November 2011.  On 20 July 2013, she married  Mr  James
    Finlay, a British citizen.  She applied for  leave  to  remain  on  the
    basis of family life with Mr Finlay.  Her application was refused  with
    no right of appeal.  She made further representations to the respondent
    but her application was refused again on 27 February 2014 but  on  this
    occasion with a right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.  Her appeal
    was dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Obi) in a determination
    which is dated  15  August  2014.   The  appellant  now  appeals,  with
    permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. Granting permission, Judge Rintoul wrote:

         "It is arguable that the judge erred in  her  conclusion  that  the
         appellant's husband was not so dependent on the appellant  that  he
         could not cope without her for a 'short period', given the evidence
         that the husband required the appellant to get him out of  bed  and
         to get dressed, amongst other matters."

 3. The appeal turned on the question as to whether it was  reasonable  for
    the appellant to return to Ghana in order to make  an  out  of  country
    application for entry clearance.  Judge Obi described this as a "Sabir"
    case, referring to Sabir (Appendix FM - EX.1 not free standing)  [2014]
    UKUT 63 (IAC).  In that case, Judge Coker concluded at [33]:

         "The public policy  of  requiring  a  person  to  apply  under  the
         Immigration Rules from abroad is not the only  matter  weighing  in
         the SSHD's side of  the  balance.  There  are  cogent  reasons  for
         requiring the claimant to return to Pakistan to make an application
         for entry clearance and I conclude it would  be  proportionate  for
         her to dos so. The claimant arrived in the UK  as  a  visitor.  She
         does not meet the requirements of the Rules and it was clear at the
         time of the marriage that  she  could  not  do  so;  she  would  be
         expected to leave  the  UK  and  return  to  Pakistan  to  make  an
         application for entry clearance absent circumstances such that such
         a course of action would be unreasonable or harsh, contrary to  her
         right to respect for her family and private life. The likelihood or
         otherwise of her being able to meet the requirements of  the  Rules
         for entry clearance is  not  a  relevant  consideration  -  see  SB
         (Bangladesh) v SSHD [2007] EWCA Civ 28. There has been no  evidence
         before me that  could  lead  to  a  conclusion  that  the  proposed
         interference (namely her  hypothetical  removal  to  Pakistan  from
         where she would make an application for entry clearance  to  return
         as a spouse) in the claimant's right to respect for her family  and
         private life as a woman married to a  British  citizen  living  and
         working in the UK is  anything  other  than  proportionate  to  the
         competing public interest issues."

 4. For the Upper Tribunal, Mr Mannam, for the appellant, did not  seek  to
    challenge the basis of the judge's assessment of proportionality  under
    Article 8, that is, if it is reasonable for the appellant to return  to
    Ghana to make her application, then her Article  8  appeal  should  not
    succeed.  However, it is the reasonableness of that  course  of  action
    with which his client takes issue.  The appellant's argument  rests  on
    the assertion that she needs to care on a daily basis for her  husband,
    Mr Finlay.  She asserts that it would not  be  reasonable  for  her  to
    leave her husband without her assistance even for the relatively  brief
    time it would take for her to make an application for  entry  clearance
    from Ghana.

 5. The evidence regarding Mr Finlay's medical condition arose entirely out
    of examination-in-chief and  cross-examination  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal; the statements of the appellant  and  Mr  Finlay  which  were
    submitted to that Tribunal contained no reference at all  to  the  care
    needs of Mr Finlay.  The judge summarised the appellant's oral evidence
    as follows;

         "[Mr Finlay] cannot get up easily as he has difficulties  with  his
         legs and [the appellant] has to help him on  a  daily  basis.   She
         said she helps him with his dressing after he has had  a  bath  and
         that she creams him and dresses  him  and  that  she  collects  his
         mediation (sic)."

    Mr Finlay told the judge that he  "suffers  from  osteoarthritis  which
    affects his knees.  He is unable to walk long distances or  go  up  and
    down the stairs."  However, he had recently "fallen off a  ladder"  and
    the appellant had had to "help him up" [14].   Mr  Finlay  subsequently
    explained that he had been cutting a hedge when he had fallen  off  the
    ladder.  He also said that he was "aware  that  he  could  call  Social
    Services to help him but did not think he could do it at awkward  times
    of the day."

 6. In her findings of fact, the judge observed that "despite [Mr Finlay's]
    health problems he is in full-time work  as  a  sales  floor  manager."
    That evidence appears in Mr Finlay's witness statement at [3]:

         "I am a sales floor manager with Vaclansa PLC and have  worked  for
         this company for about five years.  I earn ï¿½25,000 a year and  also
         in receipt of a private and state pension."

 7. The judge was satisfied that the couple are in a genuine and subsisting
    relationship but was not satisfied that Mr Finlay would

         "... not be able to cope for a short period of time if  he  had  to
         live on his own whilst the appellant returned to Ghana and made the
         appropriate application for entry clearance.  He  told  me  in  his
         evidence that his wife sometimes helps him to get into his bath but
         it did not appear to me that  he  was  dependent  on  her  for  his
         personal needs at such a high level that he would not  be  able  to
         cope without her for a short period of time."

 8. The grounds assert that the  judge  had  not  considered  the  evidence
    before  coming  to  those  findings.   There  had  been   no   discrete
    credibility assessment of the evidence of the appellant or Mr Finlay.

 9. I do not find that the judge has erred in law.  The judge noted at [22]
    that letters written in support of the appellant "all stated that  they
    do not believe that Mr Finlay could leave the UK because of his ties to
    this country".   As  I  have  noted,  the  witness  statements  of  the
    appellant and Mr Finlay themselves make absolutely no reference to care
    needs or disability.  That omission is extraordinary; the  very  strong
    impression given by the appellant's evidence is that the idea  that  it
    would be unreasonable for her to return  to  Ghana  on  account  of  Mr
    Finlay's care needs had not  occurred  to  her  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing. Further, as the judge  quite  properly  observed,  Mr
    Finlay is, despite his claimed disabilities, able to  continue  working
    as a sales floor manager; his statement makes no reference  at  all  to
    any allowances being made by his employers in respect  of  his  claimed
    disability.  It is also clear that the judge had in  mind  the  obvious
    disconnect between Mr Finlay's evidence that he cannot "go up and  down
    the stairs" and the fact that he had "fallen off a ladder".   Moreover,
    there was absolutely no medical evidence put  before  the  judge  which
    might have provided an objective assessment of  any  disabilities  from
    which Mr Finlay may suffer.  There was also  nothing  in  the  evidence
    before the First-tier Tribunal to indicate that Mr Finlay is in receipt
    of any disability benefits; had he required  assistance  with  cooking,
    dressing or other personal needs it is reasonable  to  assume  that  he
    would have applied for the appropriate state benefits.

10. The judge did not find that Mr Finlay is not disabled or even  that  he
    has exaggerated his disabilities;  in  the  light  of  my  observations
    above, that assessment might be considered generous.  However,  I  have
    no doubt that the judge did consider all the evidence that  was  before
    her and that her finding that Mr Finlay would be able to  cope  on  his
    own without the appellant's assistance for a "short period of time" was
    manifestly available to her on the evidence.

11. The second grounds of appeal  is  wholly  without  merit.   The  ground
    asserts that the judge "did not consider the evidence relating  to  the
    appellant's husband at  all  in  her  consideration  of  the  balancing
    exercise [required by Article 8 ECHR]."  While  it  is  true  that  the
    judge did not make any specific findings as to the nature and extent of
    Mr Finlay's disabilities she was,  as  I  have  noted  above,  able  to
    conclude that he would be able to cope  with  living  on  his  own  and
    without the appellant's assistance.  Given  that  she  was  faced  with
    contradictory evidence regarding Mr Finlay's claimed  disabilities  and
    had no medical evidence, I consider that she was required to do no more
    than that.

12. I find that the judge did not err in law for the  reasons  asserted  in
    the grounds of appeal or at all.  The appeal is dismissed.

DECISION

13. This appeal is dismissed.
