Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Andr�, instructed by White Ryland

For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer

There was a failure on the part of the appellant's representatives  in  this
case to follow both Tribunal Practice Directions and Supreme Court  Practice
Directions  relating  to  citation  of  unreported  decisions.    Unreported
decisions are not to be  cited  except  in  accordance  with  such  Practice
Directions.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The  appellant,  a  national  of  Sudan,  seeks  reconsideration  of  a
      determination of the Immigration Judge, Mrs M.M  Shanahan, notified on
      5 April 2005, dismissing his appeal against a decision  to  refuse  to
      grant asylum and to remove  him  as  an  illegal  entrant  by  way  of
      directions under paragraphs 8-10 of Schedule 2 to the Immigration  Act
      1971. The initial question we must address is whether the  Immigration
      Judge materially erred in law.

2.   The basis of the appellant's claim was that he  was  a  member  of  the
      Zaghawa tribe and lived in a village called  Wadi  Karou.  He  made  a
      living there as a trader. His problems began on 11 July 2004 when  his
      village was attacked and pillaged by  the Janjaweed. He was one of the
      survivors. He managed to escape,  but  on  the  way  to  Manyachi  was
      kidnapped by government security forces who accused  him  of  being  a
      black  African and supporter of the Sudanese People's Liberation  Army
      (SPLA). He was transferred to Al Niyala where he was kept in  solitary
      confinement until 12 September 2004.   When  he  became  ill  security
      forces took him to Niyala Hospital. One of his friends helped  him  to
      escape. Going first to Labadou he was then taken to Port Sudan where a
      ship took him to the UK.  He claimed that his brother was a member  of
      the opposition party (SPLP) and that he was accused of being a  member
      of the  Movement of Justice (JEM) in Sudan.

3.   The Immigration Judge did  not  find  any  aspect  of  the  appellant's
      account credible except that he was a member of the Zaghawa tribe.  On
      this basis she was prepared to accept that at this time he  could  not
      safely be returned to Darfur.  As regards internal relocation, she did
      not  think  he  could  live  safely  in  the   south  of  Sudan.   She
      considered, however, that he could relocate to Khartoum.

             '66. The other option available to the appellant is to  remain
                 in Khartoum to where he would be  returned.  The  objective
                 evidence sets out the situation with the IDP camps  in  the
                 areas around Khartoum and it is clear that  conditions  are
                 difficult and harsh. Mr Andre referred  to  the  report  at
                 page 21 of the appellant's  bundle  which  deals  with  the
                 situation at the  El Salaam camp  in  Omdurman.  He  argued
                 that the humanitarian situation is such that the  appellant
                 cannot be expected to relocate to any of these camps or  to
                 Khartoum. I have also had  regard  to  the  evidence  about
                 arrests of  Darfurians  outside  Darfur  and  in  Khartoum.
                 However these arrests appear to have been due to actual  or
                 perceived support of one of the armed opposition groups  in
                 Darfur, students, lawyers or human rights defenders.


             67.  I consider that is possible for the appellant  to  remain
                 in Khartoum. Given my above findings he  has  no  political
                 standing or  indeed  any  other  factors,  apart  from  his
                 ethnicity, which would bring him to the  adverse  attention
                 of the authorities. It is likely that he will be questioned
                 at the airport on return but there is no evidence  that  he
                 will  be  detained  or  ill-treated  such   as   to   cause
                 persecution  or treatment contrary to  Articles 2 or 3.


             68.  In conclusion I am  not satisfied  that  the  appellant's
                 account is credible but he  is  a  member  of  the  Zaghawa
                 tribe. He cannot be returned to Darfur  at  this  time  but
                 there is no risk of persecution or breach of Articles 2  or
                 3 by return to Khartoum. I do not consider that it would be
                 unduly harsh to expect the appellant to relocate there,  he
                 is a young man who has given no evidence of any  continuing
                 health problems and while I accept the difficult conditions
                 in these camps it does not found a claim under  Articles  2
                 or 3.'

4.   In the grounds of appeal it was submitted firstly that the  Immigration
      Judge had erred by  not  placing  enough  emphasis  on  the  objective
      material indicating that Khartoum was unsafe, in particular  paragraph
      2.2 of the December 2004 Amnesty International  report, 'Sudan: No one
      to  complain  to:  No  respect  for  the  victims,  impunity  for  the
      perpetrators',  which  highlighted   arrest   and   ill-treatment   of
      Darufrians in IDP camps around the capital. This evidence  showed,  it
      was argued, that Darfurians are targeted  in  Khartoum  by  virtue  of
      ethnicity alone, and that  the  risk  is  even  higher  for  males  of
      fighting age.  The second main submission  was  that  the  Immigration
      Judge failed to place enough emphasis on the  inhumane  conditions  in
      the Khartoum  IDP  camps:  no  detailed  reasoning  was  provided  for
      rejecting  the appellant's evidence demonstrating that the authorities
      have bulldozed IDP camps around Khartoum. It was  submitted  that  the
      Immigration Judge erred in particular by failing to give  reasons  for
      distinguishing the appellant's case from the Tribunal case  of  Otnam,
      HX/08803/2003 notified on 27 July 2004 in  which  it  was  found  that
      Khartoum  was  not  appropriate  or   reasonable   as   a   relocation
      alternative, it being unduly harsh, given suspicions about  Darfurians
      and  the  fact  that  at  least  one  camp  had  been  bulldozed   and
      circumstances are to say the least  difficult.   Conjoined  with  this
      ground, it was submitted that the appellant wished to rely on an order
      made by Mr Justice Collins in an application for statutory  review  by
      an appellant Suliman (CO/0953) [2005]  in  which  the  judge  mentions
      Otnam.

5.   Miss D.K. Gill,  the  Senior  Immigration  Judge  who  dealt  with  the
      application for reconsideration, rejected the appellant's first ground
      of appeal. She said it amounted to no more than  a  disagreement  with
      the Immigration Judge's findings and an attempt to reargue issues that
      were before the Immigration Judge. Ms Gill found that the  Immigration
      Judge had 'carefully considered' the objective evidence and had  given
      her reasons for concluding that it would be safe for the appellant  to
      relocate.  Ms Gill added that  the  Immigration  Judge's   finding  on
      safety was one which was fully open to her on the evidence  which  was
      before her, for the reasons she gave.

6.   However, Miss Gill stated that it was arguable  the  Immigration  Judge
      had erred in law with regard to her  finding  that  it  would  not  be
      unduly harsh for the appellant to relocate to Khartoum, in that:

             '(a) she failed to give adequate reasons in law  for  reaching
                 that finding;  and


             (b)  she failed to refer to the  Otnam case ... I am satisfied
                 that the  [Immigration Judge]  was  given  a  copy  of  the
                 determination in that case. It appears  that  the  previous
                 Practice Direction 10 (which was still in force at the date
                 of hearing) was not complied with. This may all be relevant
                 in determining the error of law point. I have had regard to
                 the reasons given in the decision of Sir Andrew  Collins on
                 23 February  2005  (reversing  the  Tribunal's  refusal  of
                 permission on that case).  The parties  may  also  wish  to
                 address the Tribunal on the recent reported decision [2005]
                 UKIAT 00069)).

7.   The latter was a reference to the Tribunal case of  MM  (Sudan)  [2005]
      UKIAT 00069 notified on 9 March 2005.

8.   The bundle of documents prepared  by  the  appellant's  representatives
      included  several  items  which  post-dated  the  Immigration  Judge's
      determination. Mr Andr� highlighted the reference to a 21 October 2005
       Amnesty International  report of certain  IDP camps  being  summarily
      destroyed and their inhabitants being cast out into the desert. We had
      to remind Mr Andre that he could  not rely on these items of  evidence
      in order to demonstrate a material error of law.   We  also  expressed
      our concern that, insofar as he sought to rely  on  post-determination
      items, he - or at least those instructing him - had not  seen  fit  to
      include the Country  Guidance  case  of  AE  (Relocation  -  Darfur  -
      Khartoum an option) Sudan CG [2005] UKAIT 00101 .   There is a general
      duty on representatives to ensure that the materials they adduce cover
      the latest Tribunal guidance.

9.   We asked Mr Andr� to explain  the  legal  basis  for  his  citation  of
      Otnam.  Practice  Direction 10 which  was  still  in  force  when  the
      Immigration Judge (then Adjudicator) heard  this  appeal  on  7  March
      states :

                        'Immigration Appeal Tribunal
                            Practice Direction 10
                       Office of the Chief Adjudicator
                       Practice Direction CA3 of 2003


                         Citation of Determinations


         1.   From 19th May the Immigration Appeal Tribunal will  cease  the
            practice of reporting and publishing  all  its  determinations.
            From that time, determinations will be  either   'reported'  or
            'unreported'.  The decision  whether to report a case  is  that
            of the Tribunal and is not perceived to be an  issue  in  which
            the parties to the appeal have an interest.


         2.   Reported determinations will receive a natural citation number
            of the form [2003] UKIAT 00001 and will  be  widely  available.
            They will be an anonymised and will be  cited  by  the  neutral
            citation number.  Determinations without a number in this  form
            are unreported.


         3.   Unreported determinations will  receive  no  neutral  citation
            number.  They will be sent to  the  parties  but  will  not  be
            published. Anonymised version will be deposited in the  Supreme
            Court Library.  (Negotiations for an electronic depository  are
            in   progress).


         4.   From the  date  of  this  Practice  Direction,  no  unreported
            determination of the  Tribunal,  and  no  determination  of  an
            Adjudicator, may be cited in proceedings before any Adjudicator
            or the Tribunal unless either:


            (i)   the claimant in the  present proceedings, or a member  of
               his family, was a party to  the  proceedings  in  which  the
               previous determination was issued, or


            (ii)  the Adjudicator, or the Tribunal, (as the case  may  be),
               gives permission.


         5.   Permission will be given only in exceptional cases,  and  even
            more rarely in  relation  to  Adjudicator  determinations.   An
            application for permission to cite an unreported determination:


            (i)   must include a full transcript of the determination,
            (ii)    must   identify   the   proposition   for   which   the
               determination is to be cited,
            (iii) must certify that that proposition is not  found  in  any
               reported determination of the Tribunal,  and  has  not  been
               superseded by a decision of higher authority, and
            (iv)  must be accompanied by a summary analysis  of  all  other
               decisions of the Tribunal, and all  available  decisions  of
               higher authority, relating to the same issue, promulgated in
               the period  beginning six months before   the  date  of  the
               decision proposed to be cited and ending  two  weeks  before
               the date of the hearing.   This analysis is intended to show
               the trend of AIT decisions on this issue.


         6.   Determinations of the Tribunal published in 2002 and  previous
            years will continue to be citable.  From 1st May 2004,  however
            a party citing  a  determination  bearing  a  natural  citation
            number prior  to  [2003]  (including  all  series  of  'bracket
            numbers') must be in a position to certify that the  matter  or
            proposition for which the determination is cited has  not  been
            the subject of a more recent, reported, Tribunal determination.


         7.   'Starred' determinations of the Tribunal continue  to  have  a
            special status.  They  are  to  be  treated  as  being  on  the
            Appellate Authorities.   Other determinations are not  binding.
            The Tribunal will  nevertheless attempt to  secure  consistency
            in its decision-making and to provide appropriate  guidance  to
            Adjudicators.'


                                                          Mr Justice Ouseley
                                                                   President
                                                         H H Judge Hodge OBE
                                                          Chief Adjudicator'

10.  This Practice  Direction was accompanied by Explanatory Notes which  at
      paragraph 2 stated:

             'Large number of decisions, coupled with the increased numbers
             of  judiciary  at  both  levels  of  the  Immigration   Appeal
             Tribunal, has exacerbated problems  of  'selective  citation'.
             Adjudicators and panels of the  Tribunal  are  shown  Tribunal
             determinations in an attempt to persuade them that the instant
             case   should  be  decided   in   a   similar   way.   Whether
             intentionally or not, this process  if  often  misleading,  as
             there is no proper effort to survey the whole of the  Tribunal
             output on a particular topic, or to discover whether there  is
             any good reason for following one decision  which  immigration
             control cited rather than others, not cited, which may  be  to
             the opposite effect.'

11.  It is plain that Mr  Andr�'s citation of Otnam  was  contrary  to  this
      Practice Direction.  Its  production  was  not  accompanied  by  other
      authorities covering the previous six months' period.

12.   Nor,  for  similar  reasons,  can  Mr  Andr�'s   citation   meet   the
      requirements of the  April 2005 AIT  Practice Directions, paragraph 17
      of which states:

        '17. Citation of determinations


        17.1 A determination of the Tribunal  to  which  this  subparagraph
             applies will be either "reported" or "unreported". The decision
             whether to report a case is that of the  Tribunal  and  is  not
             perceived to be an issue in which the parties to an appeal have
             an interest.


        17.2  Paragraph  17.1  applies  to  any   determination   that   is
             promulgated following a hearing at which the   jurisdiction  of
             the Tribunal was excised by a Senior Immigration Judge (whether
             sitting alone or with another member or members).


        17.3 No determination will be reportable which  follows  a  hearing
             before  a  single  member  of  the  Tribunal  other  than   the
             President or a Deputy President of the Tribunal.


        17.4 Reported determinations will receive a neural citation  number
             of the form  [2005] UKIAT 00000 and will  be  widely  available
             (including being available on the  Tribunal's  website).   They
             will be anonymised and will be  cited by the  neutral  citation
             number.  Determinations without such a number  are  unreported.
             Anonymised  versions  of  unreported  determinations  will   be
             deposited  in  the   Supreme  Court  Library  and  treated   as
             unreported determinations for the purposes  of  the  Tribunal's
             website.


        17.5 Other determinations will receive no neutral citation  number.
             They will be sent to the parties (in accordance with the Rules)
             but will not be published.


        17.6 A determination of the Tribunal which has  not  been  reported
             may not be cited in  proceedings  before  the  Tribunal  unless
             either:


             (a)   the appellant   in the present proceedings, or  a  member
                  of his family, was  a party to the proceedings  in  which
                  the previous determination was issued; or


             (b)   the Tribunal gives permission.


        17.7 Permission  under  paragraph  17.6  will  be   given  only  in
             exceptional  cases,  and  even  more  rarely  in  the  case  of
             determinations promulgated following a hearing before a  single
             member of the Tribunal.


        17.8 An application for permission to cite  a  determination  which
             has not been reported must:


             (a)   include a full transcript of the determination;
             (b)   identify the proposition for which the  determination  is
                 to be cited;
             (c)   certify that the proposition is not found in any reported
                 determination of the Tribunal  or of the IAT  and  has  not
                 been superseded by a decision of a higher authority;  and
             (d)   be  accompanied  by  a  summary  analyses  of  all  there
                 decisions of the Tribunal and all  available  decisions  of
                 higher authority, relating to the same  issue,  promulgated
                 in the period beginning six months before the date  of  the
                 decision proposed to be cited and ending two  weeks  before
                 the date of the hearing.  (This  analysis  is  intended  to
                 show the trend of Tribunal decisions on the issue).


       17.9   The provisions of paragraph 17.6 to 17.8 apply to  unreported
             determinations of the IAT and to determinations of Adjudicators
             as those provisions apply to unreported determinations  of  the
             Tribunal and to determinations promulgated following a  hearing
             by a single member of the Tribunal.


       17.10  Until 4 October 2005, the references in paragraph 127.8(d) to
             decisions of the  Tribunal  shall  be  construed  as  including
             references to decisions of the IAT.


       17.11  A party citing a determination of the IAT bearing  a  neutral
             citation number prior  to   [2003]  (including  all  series  of
             "bracket numbers"] must be in a position to  certify  that  the
             matter or proposition for which the determination is cited  has
             not been the subject of more recent,  reported,  determinations
             of the IAT or of the Tribunal.'


13.  Mr Andr� admitted that he could not seek to  justify  his  citation  of
      Otnam by reference  to IAT or IAT Practice Directions.   Nevertheless,
      he submitted, we should still permit it to be cited as an authority in
      the interests of justice. At stake, he  said,  were  important  issues
      affecting evaluation of country conditions in a country which was  the
      focus of world wide concern as regards the treatment of Darfurians  by
      its government and by those associated with it.   Otnam  was  directly
      relevant to the issues at the heart of this appeal.

14.  Citation of Otnam could be justified in any event, argued Mr Andr�,  by
      reference to the mention made of it by Mr Justice Collins in the order
      he made on the  Suliman application, which he  said,  approved  Otnam.
      The order to which he referred stated:

                        'In the High Court of Justice
                            Queens Bench Division
                        Administrative Court Service

           In the matter of an application for Statutory Review -
            s.101(2) Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002

                    SULIMAN v Immigration Appeal Tribunal


             NOTIFICATION of the Judge's decision (CPR Part 54.25)


             Following  consideration  of  the  documents  lodged  by   the
             Applicant


             Order by the Honourable Mr Justice Collins


              Decision of the Tribunal reversed
             Reasons:


             Despite  the  very  full  and  careful  determination  of  the
             relevant issues by the Adjudicator, the Tribunal  decision  in
             Otnam,   which   deals   specifically   with   relocation   by
             Darfurians, persuades me that there has been a failure by  the
             Adjudicator to have regard to a material consideration. I note
             that the decision in question is of a full legal Tribunal.'

15.  We do not accept that Mr Andr� can found his citation of Otnam  on  the
      reference made to it in  Suliman.  Orders  made  on  statutory  review
      applications and the reasons given  for  them  cannot  be  equated  to
      reasoned judgments. They are made on the  papers  without  submissions
      from both parties and must never be cited. We are not persuaded in any
      event  that  it  was  made  clear  to   Collins,  J   that  Otnam  was
      unreported. So far as unreported  cases  before  the  High  Court  are
      concerned, we understand their position to  be  governed  by  Practice
      Direction  (Citation of Authorities) (Sup Ct) [2001] 1 WLR 1001  which
      at para 8 states in its relevant parts:

             'Practice Directions (Citation of Authorities)


             Practice -  Civil  proceedings  -  Citation  of  authorities  -
             Categories of judgments to be cited only if clearly  purporting
             to develop law - Requirement to justify citation  of  judgments
             purporting  not  to  develop  law  -  Method  of   citation   -
             Authorities from other jurisdictions.
             ...


             Categories of judgments that may only be cited if  they  fulfil
             specified requirements.


             6.1 A judgment falling into one of the  categories referred  to
             in paragraph 6.2 below may not in future be  cited  before  any
             court unless it clearly indicates that it purports to establish
             a new principle or to extend the present law.   In  respect  of
             judgments delivered after the  date  of  this  direction,  that
             indication must take the form of an express statement  to  that
             effect. In respect of judgments delivered before  the  date  of
             this direction that indication must be present  in  or  clearly
             deducible from the language used in the judgment.


             6.2 Paragraph  6.1  applies  to  the  following  categories  of
             judgment
             Applications attended by one party only
             Applications for permission to appeal
             Decisions on applications that only decide that the application
             is arguable
             County court cases, unless (a) cited in order to illustrate the
             conventional measure of damages in personal  injury  case;   or
             (b) cited in a county court in  order  to  demonstrate  current
             authority at that level on an issue  in  respect  of  which  no
             decision at a higher level of authority is available.


             Methods of citation
             8.1 Advocates will in future be required to state,  in  respect
             of each authority that they wish to cite,  the  proposition  of
             law that the authority  demonstrates,  and  the  parts  of  the
             judgment that support that proposition. If it is sought to cite
             more than one authority in  support  of  a  given  proposition,
             advocates must state the reason for taking that course.




16.  From the above it is clear that it was not appropriate to  cite  either
      Otnam or Suliman.

17.  Even if Otnam had been properly cited, it was plainly not, as Mr  Andr�
      asserted, 'approved'.  All  Mr  Justice  Collins  did  was  reverse  a
      decision refusing to grant permission to appeal; he did not decide  on
      its merits: see above paragraph  15.

18.  Just why it would be wrong to permit citation of an unreported case  in
      this case is amply demonstrated more generally by  the  state  of  the
      Tribunal's reported and Country Guideline decisions on  the  issue  of
      internal relocation in Khartoum at  the  time  the  Immigration  Judge
      (then Adjudicator) heard this appeal in March 2005.   In existence  at
      that time (and in the Home Office bundle submitted  for  this  appeal)
      was AB (Return of southern  Sudanese)  [2004]  UKIAT  notified  on  20
      September 2004.   There was also the reported case of MM,  which  Miss
      Gill mentioned in her order for reconsideration. Thus the citation  of
      Otnam was an attempt to rely on one unreported case without  reference
      to the existence of other relevant reported cases.  This is  precisely
      the type of abuse which  the Tribunal  Practice  Directions  exist  to
      prevent. It may be that AB did not specifically address the  issue  of
      the return of  Darfurians,  but  it  was  relevant  to  the  issue  of
      conditions prevailing in Khartoum for displaced persons.

19.  It must not be forgotten either that the panel in  Otnam  did  not  see
      fit to make that case a reported case.  In  our  view  the  reason  is
      obvious: as was stated at paragraph 7, the evidence  relating  to  the
      circumstances of Darfurians in Khartoum 'has derived entirely,  it  is
      right to say, from the appellant'.

20.  Hence we do not accept that Otnam can be cited before us  and  we  take
      no account of it.

21.  So far as the interests of justice are concerned these in our view  are
      met by this Tribunal placing focus on the  issue  of  whether  on  the
      background materials that were before the Immigration  Judge  she  was
      entitled to conclude that relocation to Khartoum would not  be  unduly
      harsh.

22.  Mr Andr� sought to argue that the Immigration Judge's treatment of  the
      internal relocation issue was flawed on both  Refugee  Convention  and
      Article 3 grounds. However, he was unable to point to any reference to
      Article 3 in the grounds of appeal. His argument has therefore, to  be
      confined to the appellant's position under the Refugee Convention.

23.  Mr Andr� sought  to  argue  that  the  text  of  paragraph  66  of  the
      Immigration Judge's determination  disclosed  that  she  had  confined
      herself to just one page (page 21) of the  IRIN  report  dealing  with
      the situation in  IDP camps in and around Khartoum (contained at p.179
      of the bundle).  She  had,  argued  Mr  Andr�,  effectively  seen  the
      situation in the  El Salaam camp in Omduram as  determinative  of  the
      issue generally. We cannot agree. The opening sentence of paragraph 66
      makes clear that the Immigration Judge had in mind  evidence  relating
      to the 'situation with IDP camps in the areas around Khartoum', a fact
      further demonstrated by the reference in the  third  sentence  to  the
      humanitarian situation in 'any of these camps or to Khartoum'.

24.  Mr Andr�'s point was really only concerned with the  amount  of  weight
      the Immigration Judge should have given  to  the  evidence  about  the
      humanitarian situation facing Darfurians  in  Khartoum.   As  we  have
      already noted, reconsideration was specifically not made  in  relation
      to his argument about the issue of the safety of Khartoum for  members
      of the Zaghawa. It was the Immigration  Judge's  assessment  that  the
      conditions in  IDP camps  in and around Khartoum  were  difficult  and
      harsh, but not unduly harsh. In our view that was an assessment  which
      was reasonably open to her on the  available  evidence.  Although  the
      Amnesty International  report did pinpoint  the existence of  inhumane
      conditions at one or two of  the  IDP  camps,  the  evidence  did  not
      indicate that  such conditions were widespread.   We  would  note  too
      that in reaching  her  conclusion  the  Immigration  Judge  also  took
      careful account of the appellant's  particular  circumstances,  noting
      his lack of political activity and his lack of any  continuing  health
      problems.

25.  Given that we have not identified  a  material  error  of  law  in  the
      Immigration Judge's determination, it is not open to us to  take  into
      account recent materials presented to us by Mr Andr�.

26.  However, had we been able to take account of these,  we  would  observe
      that the situation  since  March  2005  has  been  considered  by  the
      Tribunal in  AE  [2005] UKIAT  and LM [2005] UKIAT 00014  notified  on
      30 June 2005.  In Hamid  and Others [2005] EWCA Civ 1219,  a  judgment
      of 25 October 2005, the Court of Appeal rejected a challenge to AE.


27.  For completeness, we would add that even had  we  accepted  Mr  Andr�'s
      grounds of appeal as meaning to raise Article 3 issues, we would  have
      reached similar conclusions. The Immigration  Judge's   assessment  as
      set out in paragraphs 67 and 68 that conditions in Khartoum  does  not
      breach Articles 2 and 3, was entirely justified.

  28. Although Mr Andr� has failed in his submissions in this  case,  he  is
      quite right that the  situation  for   Darfurians  in   Sudan  and  in
      Khartoum in particular requires assessment on a  periodic  basis.  The
      Tribunal is well aware of the need to keep the country guidance  cases
      under review and will continue to do so.


  29. To conclude:


      The Adjudicator did not err  in  law.   Accordingly  her  decision  to
      dismiss the appeal on both   asylum  and  human  rights  grounds  must
      stand.
