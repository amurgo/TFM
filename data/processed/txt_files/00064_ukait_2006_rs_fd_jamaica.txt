Where a notice of appeal is submitted without grounds, it will not  normally
be appropriate for extra time to be allowed for the submission  of  grounds.
The failure to include grounds of appeal is a breach  of  Rule  8(1)(c)  and
can properly lead to determination without a hearing under Rule 15(2)(c).

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The first appellant is a citizen  of  Jamaica.   She  has  submitted  a
    notice of appeal against the decision of the respondent on 27  February
    2006 refusing her entry clearance to the United Kingdom  as  a  visitor
    for six months.  The Notice of Refusal gives the following reasons  for
    the refusal:

        "I have taken the compassionate aspects  of  this  application  and
        into consideration but consider that the following points  outweigh
        them:
         . You have  not  shown  that  you  are  able  on  the  balance  of
           probabilities  to  maintain  and  accommodate  yourself  without
           recourse to public funds.
         . On the balance of probabilities, I am  not  satisfied  that  you
           have sufficiently strong family or economic ties to  Jamaica  to
           satisfy me that you  intend  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom  on
           completion of your proposed visit.
         . I have taken account of your circumstances  but  am  aware  that
           they are modest by local standards.  I therefore do not find  it
           credible that you have sufficient incentive to leave the  UK  at
           the end of your visit.
         . I note that your sponsor has produced no evidence that they  can
           pay for your trip.  Given this I cannot be satisfied  that  they
           are able to finance your visit, as claimed."


 2. The notice of appeal is signed by the appellant but not dated.  It  was
    received, in time, by the respondent on 9 March 2006 and duly forwarded
    to the Tribunal.  At section 3K of  the  form  the  appellant  has  not
    indicated whether or not she wishes to have her appeal  decided  at  an
    oral hearing, but at 3L, in answer to the question "If you want an oral
    hearing, who will be present?", she has  ticked  in  the  box  next  to
    "Sponsor(s)", and written the name and address of  her  sponsors.   She
    has also named the female sponsor as her representative.  At the end of
    the form, in section 7, where there is  a  space  marked  "If  you  are
    sending any other documents with this  form  to  support  your  appeal,
    please list them here:", she has written "Bank  Statement/Job  Letter".
    No such documents in fact accompanied  the  appeal  form.   Section  4,
    "Grounds of your appeal", is completely blank.

 3. The second appellant is a citizen  of  Turkey.   She  has  submitted  a
    notice of appeal against the decision of the respondent on 13  February
    2006 refusing her entry clearance to the United  Kingdom  as  a  family
    visitor for three months.  The reasons given by the respondent  are  as
    follows:

        "You wish to visit your Uncle in the  UK.   You  have  presented  a
        sponsorship declaration from him along with copies of his  payslips
        and copy of his passport.  You state on  your  form  that  he  will
        cover the cost of your trip.  However you  have  not  produced  any
        evidence of his financial status such as bank  statements  to  show
        that he has adequate discretionary funds available to him to  cover
        the costs relating to your trip.


        I note that you are currently unemployed.  You used to  work  until
        recently but gave up to look  after  your  mother  who  is  unwell.
        Your family supports you financially.   YOU  have  present  2  bank
        statements in your name.  However, I note that both statements  are
        very recent with deposits being made on 27 January 2006 for one and
        the other was opened on 21 December 2005.  There is  no  indication
        as to the origin of the funds.  I cannot be satisfied that this  is
        indeed a true reflection of your  current  personal  and  financial
        status.


        Taking into account the above factors, I am not satisfied,  on  the
        balance of probabilities that the financial outlay on your proposed
        visit, or the reasons you have given, is commensurate with  you  or
        your  sponsor's  current  social  and  economic  circumstances  and
        therefore that you will indeed be able to meet the  costs  of  your
        return journey as required by paragraph 41(viii).


        I  am  not  satisfied  that  you  will  be  able  to  maintain  and
        accommodate yourself adequately out of resources available  to  you
        without recourse to public funds or taking employment; or  will  be
        maintained and accommodated adequately by relatives and friends  as
        required by paragraph 41(vi).


        Taking all the above factors into consideration, I am not satisfied
        on the balance of probabilities  that  you  are  genuinely  seeking
        entry as a visitor for a limited  period  as  stated  by  you,  not
        exceeding six months and  that  you  intend  to  leave  the  United
        Kingdom at the end of the period of the  visit  stated  by  you  as
        required under paragraph 41(i) and (ii)."


 4. The appellant's  notice  of  appeal  was  received,  in  time,  by  the
    respondent on 2 March 2006.  It is signed by the appellant and dated on
    that day.  No  representative  is  nominated,  and  the  appellant  has
    indicated at 3K that she does not wish to have her appeal determined at
    an oral hearing.  There is no indication on  the  form  that  documents
    accompany it, but in fact the following documents are enclosed:

     i) A document in Turkish, of which no translation has  been  provided,
        apparently a cadastral or land registry  certificate,  not  in  the
        name of the appellant.
    ii) Bank statements for two accounts, corresponding exactly with  those
        which are the subject of comment in the reasons for refusal.
   iii) A letter from a supermarket in Waltham Cross, on headed  notepaper,
        indicating that an individual works there.
    iv) A similar letter,  signed  by  the  same  person,  constituting  an
        invitation to the appellant to come to the United Kingdom  for  six
        weeks.
     v) A tenancy agreement, apparently relating to the sponsors.
    vi) Various  pages  of  bank  statements  for  the  supermarket's  bank
        account, covering about a month in December 2005 and January  2006,
        and  showing  a  balance  beginning  at  nearly   �3,000,   varying
        thereafter, but rising to a peak of �3,630, before going  overdrawn
        several times and ending the period overdrawn by over �1,000.
   vii) Several pages of statements for another account, with no indication
        of the account holder.  The balance varies between about �2,400  in
        credit and �2.80 overdrawn.


    Returning to the form itself, section 4, "Grounds of your  appeal"  has
    been left completely blank.

 5. The relevant provisions in the Procedure Rules are as follows:

      "Form and contents of notice of appeal

      8.-   (1)  The notice of appeal must be in the appropriate  prescribed
form and must -
            ...
            c) set out the grounds of the appeal;
            ... .


          Method of determining appeal


      15.- (1)   Every appeal must  be  considered  by  the  Tribunal  at  a
               hearing, except where -
            ...
            b) paragraph (2) of this rule applies;
           ...
        2) The Tribunal may determine an appeal without a hearing if -
               a) all the parties to the appeal consent;
            b) the appellant  is  outside  the  United  Kingdom  or  it  is
               impracticable to give him notice of a hearing and, in either
               case, he is unrepresented;
            c) a party has failed to comply with a provision of these Rules
               or  a  direction  of  the  Tribunal,  and  the  Tribunal  is
               satisfied that  in  all  the  circumstances,  including  the
               extent of  the  failure  and  any  reasons  for  it,  it  is
               appropriate to determine the appeal without a hearing; or
            d) subject to paragraph (3), the Tribunal is satisfied,  having
               regard to the material before  it  and  the  nature  of  the
               issues raised, that the  appeal  can  be  justly  determined
               without a hearing.
      (3)   Where paragraph (2)(d) applies, the Tribunal must not  determine
           the appeal without a hearing without first  giving  the  parties
           notice of its intention to do so, and  an  opportunity  to  make
           them make written representations as to whether there should  be
           a hearing."

 6. The failure to set out the grounds  of  appeal  is  a  breach  of  Rule
    8(1)(c).  As the Tribunal has decided in HH (Sponsor as representative)
    Serbia [2006] UKAIT 00063, a breach of the requirements of Rule 8  will
    in many cases not prevent an appeal being valid; but that does not mean
    that the breach has no effect at all.  On  the  contrary,  it  has  the
    effect set out in Rule 15(2)(c): the appeal may be determined without a
    hearing.

 7. When notices of appeal have been  received  without  any  grounds,  the
    Tribunal's registry has in the past adopted the practice of writing  to
    the appellant (and, if  appropriate,  any  representative  or  sponsor)
    giving a period of  about  a  month  for  the  submission  of  grounds.
    Letters to that effect were sent out in both these cases,  without  any
    result.  We do not think that such letters should be routinely sent  to
    those who submit notices of appeal without  grounds.   It  is  for  the
    appellant to mount the appeal, and to indicate the reasons why he  says
    that the decision was wrong.  He does that by submitting  a  notice  of
    appeal.  We do not read the Procedure Rules as permitting an  appellant
    to delay sending the grounds of appeal until  a  time  well  after  the
    notice of appeal itself has been submitted:  they require  the  grounds
    of appeal to accompany the notice.  A notice without grounds of  appeal
    must, in the usual case,  be  read  as  indicating  that  although  the
    appellant does not like the decision, he has nothing particular to  say
    about why it is wrong.

 8. Of course there will be  exceptions:  sometimes  a  properly  completed
    notice of appeal will give some good reason why the grounds, or some of
    the  grounds,  cannot  accompany  it.   In  those   circumstances,   an
    Immigration Judge,  probably  the  Duty  Judge  at  the  registry,  may
    authorise time to be extended for submitting the grounds, and a  letter
    can be sent out accordingly.  But the routine of giving extra  time  in
    order to submit grounds should cease.   Appeal  forms  without  grounds
    will be passed to the Duty Judge in Loughborough for  consideration  of
    the way forward.

 9. The first question for the Immigration Judge in such  circumstances  is
    likely to be whether the appeal should be determined without a  hearing
    under sub-paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of Rule 15(2).  It is a matter for
    the Immigration Judge (the word in the Rule is "may"), but we think  it
    is likely that in the vast majority of cases, appeals to which  any  of
    these provisions apply  will  be  determined  without  a  hearing.   In
    particular, we would observe that  the  fact  that  the  appellant  has
    sought (or apparently sought) a hearing of the appeal  is  unlikely  to
    have any impact on the issue in these circumstances.

10. Dealing with the appeal without a hearing does not  mean  ignoring  the
    material on file.  It does not mean necessarily dismissing the  appeal.
    Even though there are no grounds of appeal, the  Immigration  Judge  is
    bound to consider all the material before him.  It  may  be  that  some
    documents sent in with the notice of appeal imply a submission  by  the
    appellant supported by evidence.  If the respondent's  bundle  has  not
    yet arrived, it may be necessary to await it or seek it,  in  order  to
    assess the effect of the implication, if it is material to the  outcome
    of the appeal.  But such cases, we anticipate,  will  be  unusual.   In
    appeals without grounds, the Tribunal's decision is likely to be  made,
    without further delay, in a form approximating to that which follows.

Decisions

11. The first appellant has submitted no grounds of appeal.  Rule  15(2)(c)
    applies, and in all the circumstances of the case, including  those  we
    set out  below,  we  consider  that  this  appeal  is  appropriate  for
    determination without a hearing, and we so determine it.

12. The burden of proof is on the appellant.  She has submitted no  grounds
    of appeal, and no  additional  documents.   There  is  nothing  in  the
    material  before  us  that  gives  any  reason  to  suppose  that   the
    respondent's decision was not made in accordance with  the  Immigration
    Rules.  Her appeal is dismissed.

13. The second appellant has submitted no grounds of appeal.  She does  not
    seek a hearing and has nominated no representative.  Rule 15(2)(a), (b)
    and (c) apply.  In all the circumstances of the case,  including  those
    we set out below, we consider  that  this  appeal  is  appropriate  for
    determination without a hearing and we so determine it.

14. The burden of proof is on the appellant.  She has submitted no  grounds
    of appeal, but with her appeal form are a number of  documents.   These
    appear to be in part mere confirmation of the matters mentioned in  the
    notice of refusal.  The financial documents apparently relating to  the
    sponsoring members of the appellant's family certainly fall well  short
    of establishing the family's financial standing.  The notice of refusal
    is fully reasoned and the materials now before us give no proper  basis
    for supposing that the respondent's decision was not made in accordance
    with the Immigration Rules.  We find that the appellant has  failed  to
    discharge the burden of proof.  Her appeal is dismissed.
