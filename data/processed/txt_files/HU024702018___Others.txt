Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr Z Raza, of Counsel instructed by Messrs Marks &
                    Marks Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms K Pal, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants appeal with permission against a decision  of  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Grimmett who in a determination promulgated  on
    11 July 2018 dismissed their appeals against a decision  to  refuse  to
    grant them leave to remain on human rights grounds.

2.   The first applicant had asserted that he had been in Britain  for  over
    twenty years, a claim which was later abandoned. In any  event  he  had
    been in Britain for a very considerable time.  It was not accepted that
    he was entitled to leave  to  remain.  The  claims  were  also  refused
    because the second appellant did  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    partner route and the claims of the children.  The third appellant  was
    born in May 2011 and the fourth appellant was born on  6  January  2010
    were  refused  as  the  refusal  would  not  lead  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences for them or other family members.

3.   It is of note that of relevance in this case is the  terms  of  Section
    117B(6) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  which
    states that:-

         "(6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
             public interest does not require the person's removal where -


             (a)  a person has a genuine subsisting  parental  relationship
                  with a qualifying child; and


             (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
                  the United Kingdom."

4.   Under the terms of Section 117D a qualifying child is a child  who  has
    lived in the United Kingdom for a continuous period of seven  years  or
    more.

5.   The judge carefully considered all  relevant  factors  setting  out  in
    some detail the terms of paragraph 276ADE which referred to  the  terms
    at Section E-LTRPT.2.2 which referred to a  qualifying  child  being  a
    child who had lived continuously in Britain for  seven  years  and  the
    issue of whether or not it would not be reasonable to expect the  child
    to leave the UK.

6.   In  paragraphs  11  onwards  the  judge  set  out  her  decision.   She
    emphasised that the best interests of the two children were  to  remain
    living with their parents. She pointed out  that  they  are  both  very
    young and not able to live independent lives.  The judge accepted  that
    there was  no  indication  that  they  were  not  well  cared  for  and
    emphasised that they had always lived with their parents and were still
    significantly dependent upon them.   Both  children  were  healthy  and
    doing well at school.  The judge accepted  that  they  had  never  been
    India and that it was likely to be in their best interests to remain in
    contact with their close relatives in the United Kingdom and  in  India
    in order to provide stability in their family lives.

7.   The judge did not accept the evidence of the appellant  that  they  had
    never had any contact with the second appellant's family  in  India  as
    the second appellant has been in contact with her family since leaving.
     Moreover there was evidence that the children spoke both in Hindi  and
    Punjabi.  The judge gave reasons why it was not accepted that the first
    appellant had shown that he  had  been  in  Britain  for  twenty  years
    stating there was no evidence to show that he had  entered  Britain  in
    1998, nor that he had lived in the United  Kingdom  continuously  since
    that time.  It was accepted that he had produced evidence of employment
    between 2003 and 2015.  There  was  some  incomplete  medical  evidence
    showing that he had an appointment with the GP in 2004.

8.   In paragraph 14 the judge said that she was not  satisfied  that  there
    were any very significant obstacles to the appellant's integration into
    India or that his wife or children.  The first appellant had  lived  in
    India until he was nearly 30. Although he had  said  that   he  had  no
    family there to support him and no home or  guaranteed  employment  and
    that his wife would not be able to work as she needed to take  care  of
    the children and he would have no family support and  that  his  family
    was settled in Britain or Canada, the judge emphasised  that  both  the
    first appellant and his wife had used  a  Punjabi  interpreter  despite
    living in Britain for fifteen and nearly ten years respectively and she
    did not accept that where the children who had been  brought  up  in  a
    household where Punjabi was the main language that they could not speak
    that language.  There was nothing to show that the first two appellants
    met the minimum English requirements.

9.   The judge did not accept that  the  appellant  would  not  be  able  to
    support himself and his family in India stating that he had  shown  the
    ability to maintain the family when he and they have had no right to be
    in Britain. She pointed out that his wife still had family and a family
    home in India.  There  were  no  obstacles  to  the  first  and  second
    appellants' return.  While it was argued that the children's  education
    in India would not be as good as they received in Britain there was  no
    evidence to support that claim.  The  children  would  be  entitled  to
    education in India and were young enough to adapt to a different way of
    life.  The most important fact was that the children would be to remain
    with their parents with whom they had always lived.  She  concluded  by
    saying:

         "Whilst I fully accept the children are happy, well cared  for  and
         in education in the United Kingdom at the current  time  I  am  not
         satisfied that it would not be reasonable to expect them  to  leave
         the  United  Kingdom.   They  will  continue  to  live  with  their
         immediate family and will get  to  know  other  family  members  in
         India."

10.  The judge referred to the terms of Section 117B pointing out that  both
    parents had worked in Britain when they had no right to do so and  they
    had received the benefit of significant public funds  from  the  health
    service as they had had two children  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  in
    relation to the education of the children.  While it was said that they
    had worked in Britain and paid tax the evidence provided showed  a  P60
    for 2015 showing a total tax paid of �682 in 2014, �816 in 2013, �1,175
    in 2012 and �1,268 in 2011.  The judge pointed out those sums only went
    very little way towards the costs incurred by the family  in  educating
    the two children and receiving care from the National Health Service.

11.  The judge pointed out the first appellant had not  shown  that  he  had
    the ability to earn sufficient to  meet  the  requirements  of  Section
    117B(2) or the financial requirements in  Appendix  FM  which  provides
    that an income of �24,800 would be required  for  two  adults  and  two
    children.  Moreover she pointed out that Section  117B(4)  gave  little
    weight to private life established when the appellant is in the  United
    Kingdom unlawfully.  She did take into account the  fact  the  children
    had both now been in the United Kingdom for over seven years and  their
    parents have a genuine and subsisting relationship with them  and  that
    Section 117B(6) provided that the public interest  did  not  require  a
    person's removal where the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
    relationship with a qualifying child and it would not be reasonable  to
    expect the child to leave the United Kingdom.

12.  Turning to the issue of the children she stated that:-

         "I can  find  no  reason  for  concluding  that  it  would  not  be
         reasonable for the children to leave the United Kingdom with  their
         parents.  Their lives are inextricably intertwined in view  of  the
         ages of the children.  I am satisfied that they have  contact  with
         extended family members in India and are able  to  speak  at  least
         three languages of India, Punjabi as their parents speak, Hindi  as
         the appellant said they spoke it and English.   They  are  used  to
         interacting with persons of Indian descent as  they  have  many  UK
         based relatives of Indian  origin.   According  to  their  father's
         evidence they will be able to continue their education in India and
         will have access to healthcare there."

13.  She went on to state that no doubt they would miss family  and  friends
    in Britain but it was pointed out that many children  moved  away  from
    their family homes to live elsewhere when their parents  move  jobs  or
    simply decided to change lifestyle and she said there was  no  evidence
    to suggest any harm would come to the children moving to  India.   They
    were of an age when they were adaptable and would  have  to  do  so  if
    their parents are required to leave the United Kingdom.  Their children
    must accompany them.  She could  find  nothing  unreasonable  requiring
    these children to move to India their country of nationality  of  their
    Indian parents will be returning to extended family there who, she  was
    satisfied, would be able to support the family while it  re-established
    itself in India.  She therefore found that the appellant had not  shown
    that he met the requirements of Section 117B(6)(b).

14.  The judge then went on to consider the issue of  the  human  rights  of
    these appellants outside the Rules.

15.  The grounds of appeal on which Mr Raza relied  argued  that  the  judge
    had inadequately reasoned the assessment of the best interests  of  the
    children.  They  referred  to  paragraph  88  of  MA  (Pakistan)  which
    emphasised that when a child  had  been  in  Britain  for  seven  years
    significant weight  will  need  to  be  given  in  the  proportionality
    exercise to that because of its relevance to determining the nature and
    strength of the child's best interests and also because it  established
    a starting point that leave should be granted unless there are powerful
    reasons to the contrary.

16.      It was stated that the judge  had  not  given  any  weight  to  the
    children's length of residence and how that impacted  upon  their  best
    interests.  The fact that she had said that she  had  found  no  reason
    that it would not be reasonable for the children to leave Britain  with
    their parents ignored case law  which  establishes  the  importance  of
    seven years residence for a child.  Moreover the grounds argue that the
    judge had been wrong to place weight on the fact that under Section  E-
    LTRP-1 �24,800 required for a family to meet the financial requirements
    of the Rules.  It was argued that that was irrelevant.   The  fact  was
    that the family were financially independent because of the earnings of
    the parents.

17.  Having referred to ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKHL and to the  Convention  on
    the Rights of the Child it was argued that the judge  had  not  made  a
    proper best interests assessment.

18.  At the hearing before  me  Mr  Raza  argued  that  the  judge  had  not
    properly assessed the best interests of the children and had erred when
    he has inferred that harm must  come  to  the  children  if  they  were
    removed for them to succeed under the Rules  or  Section  117B(6).   He
    argued that the judge had not referred to the children's ties and their
    best interests and although  he  accepted  that  the  judgment  of  the
    Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria) made it appropriate that the judge should
    have taken into account the  immigration  status  of  the  parents  and
    whether or not they would be returning as a family - he  argued that KO
    had not overturned the provisions in paragraph 88  of  the  Rules  that
    significant weight should be given to the length of time  the  children
    had been in Britain.  Moreover he argued that the judge  was  wrong  to
    place weight on the fact that the financial requirements of  the  Rules
    could not be met.

19.  Ms Pal merely argued that the judge had made relevant findings of  fact
    and made proper reasons for the decision.

Discussion

20.  I consider that there is no material error of law in the  determination
    of the judge in the First-tier Tribunal.  The reality is the judge very
    carefully set out and indeed focused on the best interests of  the  two
    children.  She set out the detailed findings to the children.   Mr Raza
    was not able to point to any factors which the judge had not taken into
    account.  The judge was correct to point out the children's lives  were
    focused on their parents.  She took into account  that  they  would  be
    returning as a family unit to India, that their mother had family and a
    family home there and there was nothing to indicate that the children's
    parents - the first and second appellants - would not be able  to  work
    in India.  She weighed up all relevant factors and was entitled to find
    that it was not unreasonable to accept difficult for the children to be
    expected to return to India with their parents.  She  was  entitled  to
    take into account the fact that the first  appellant  had  it  appeared
    entered Britain without authority, had lived in Britain  without  leave
    for the period which he had lived here and indeed was entitled to  find
    as was eventually conceded that the first appellant had  not  lived  in
    Britain for twenty years.  She was also entitled to point out that  the
    Rules made it clear that an income of �24,800 will be required for  two
    adults and two children.  That requirement is an indication of what the
    State considers is the necessary income for a family.   The  fact  that
    this is a human rights claim does not mean that the possible income  of
    a family should be taken into account.

21.  It is clear that the parents have simply no basis of  stay  in  Britain
    as they  have  lived  here  illegally  and  do  not  meet  any  of  the
    requirements of the Rules.  I consider  that  the  judge  did  properly
    consider all  relevant  factors  and  reached  a  conclusion  that  was
    entirely open to her.  Although Mr Raza stated the judge had  indicated
    that there must be evidence the children will come  to  harm  in  India
    that is simply a misreading of the determination.  The  fact  that  the
    judge stated that the children would not come to harm in India did  not
    indicate that for them to succeed there  must  be  evidence  that  they
    would come to harm.

22.  In all the judge weighed  up  at  some  considerable  length  and  very
    carefully all relevant factors and reached a conclusion -  that  it  is
    entirely reasonable  the  children  should  leave  Britain  with  their
    parents - which was fully open to her on the evidence  before  her.   I
    therefore find  that  there  is  no  material  error  of  law  and  the
    determination of the judge in the First-tier Tribunal and find that her
    decision dismissing this appeal must stand.
