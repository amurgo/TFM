For the Appellant:     Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr S Karim, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Khawar promulgated on 4th December 2018 in which he
    allowed Mr Ali's appeal against the decision of the Secretary of  State
    on 18th March 2018 to refuse Mr Ali's application for leave  to  remain
    on the grounds  of  ten  years'  lawful  residence.   As  this  is  the
    Secretary of State's appeal for the purposes of clarity throughout this
    decision I will refer to Mr Ali  as  being  the  Claimant  and  to  the
    Secretary of State as being the Secretary of State, given that  Mr  Ali
    was the Appellant within the First-tier Tribunal whereas the  Secretary
    of State is the Appellant in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. In this appeal the Secretary of State is represented  by  Ms  Isherwood
    the  Senior  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer  and  the  Claimant   is
    represented by Mr Karim of Counsel.  I am grateful to both of them  for
    their helpful submissions this morning. In considering  this  appeal  I
    have considered all of the documents in the file including the original
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge, the Grounds  of  Appeal  and
    the Rule 24 reply that has been submitted on behalf  of  the  Claimant,
    together with the grant of  permission  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Grimmett on 4th January 2019 and all of the documents have been  relied
    upon before the First-tier including, particularly in  this  case,  the
    original refusal letter by the Secretary  of  State  dated  18th  March
    2017. I have considered all  the  financial  documentation  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The Claimant is a citizen of Bangladesh who was born on 21st July 1986.
     Judge Khawar noted that in the Secretary of State's refusal letter the
    Secretary of State had concluded that the Appellant's application  fell
    for refusal under  paragraph  276B(iii)  general  grounds  for  refusal
    because his  character  and/or  conduct  was  such  that  it  would  be
    undesirable to allow him to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom.   Having
    considered his conduct under paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration  Rules
    under the general grounds for refusal, Judge Khawar noted at  paragraph
    4 of his decision that the Secretary of State had  noted  that  in  his
    Tier 1 application made on 24th March 2011,  the  Claimant  claimed  to
    have generated a net profit of �27,900 through  self-employment,  which
    was said to be evidenced by accounts and an accountant's  letter.   The
    Claimant had said he received such earnings for the tax period  between
    19th August 2010 until February 2011 falling  into  the  2010/2011  tax
    year.  Judge Khawar stated that,

         "However, evidence from HMRC provided on 8th February 2018  reveals
         that in the 2010/2011 tax year the Appellant declared a turnover of
         �29,757 with a net profit of �14,403 - these were figures submitted
         in his return of 15th January 2012.   Evidence  from  HMRC  on  8th
         February 2018 reveals that the Appellant made an amendment  to  his
         company tax return on 27th October 2016 and in his  amended  return
         he claimed a turnover of �29,757 with a net profit of �26,757."

    Judge Khawar went on to state that,

         "The Respondent records 'this is a difference of  �12,354  and  had
         the amount  of  �14,403  been  declared  to  the  Home  Office  the
         application would have been refused as  you  would  not  have  been
         awarded the required 80 points under Appendix A of the  Immigration
         Rules'."

 4. Judge Khawar stated that the Secretary of State's  case  was  that  the
    Claimant had proffered an incorrect income figure  in  support  of  his
    application for a Tier 1 (General) Migrant visa on 24th March 2011  and
    that  therefore  the  Secretary  of  State  concluded  the   Claimant's
    character/conduct was such that it would be undesirable to allow him to
    remain in the United Kingdom and his application was refused under  the
    general grounds of paragraph 332(5) of the Immigration  Rules  and  his
    ILR application was therefore refused under paragraph  276B(iii).   The
    Judge noted that the Claimant was said to have  family  life  with  his
    wife, Mrs Chowdhury, who was not a  British  citizen  but  was  also  a
    Bangladeshi national and that the Claimant was also  the  parent  of  a
    minor child.

 5. In making his findings Judge Khawar at paragraph 24 found that,

         "Having carefully considered all the evidence and the law  and  the
         reasons set out below I find in favour of  the  Appellant.   In  my
         judgment at best the conduct complained of  by  the  Respondent  is
         that the Appellant is guilty of an accounting error which  resulted
         in a misdeclaration of the profits of SFA Limited, the  company  of
         which he was sole director."

 6. Judge Khawar noted that the Secretary of State did not seek  to  assert
    deception or dishonesty on the part of Mr Ali at paragraph  26  of  his
    judgment the Judge set out the material paragraph in the refusal letter
    in which it  was  stated  that  the  Claimant's  actions  in  declaring
    different amounts of income to HMRC and UKVI had led  to  a  conclusion
    that in light of his character and conduct it would be  undesirable  to
    allow him to remain in the United Kingdom.




 7. However Judge Khawar went on at paragraphs 30 and 31 of the decision to
    state,

         "30. As can be seen above, no explanation is proffered as to why an
             accounting error on the part of the  Apellant/applicant  leads
             to the inference that the Appellant's character/conduct is  so
             badly tarnished that it would be  appropriate  to  refuse  his
             application under paragraph 322(5) of the Rules.

         31.  The HOPO was unable  to  explain  how  making  such  aforesaid
             accounting  error  reflects  so  badly  on   an   individual's
             character/behaviour to warrant refusal of leave."

    At paragraph 34 Judge Khawar went on to find,

         "At the risk of repeating  myself,  if  SFA  Limited  profits  were
         inadvertently under-declared (which appears to have been  the  case
         because the Appellant's  expenditure  was  inadvertently  taken  as
         being expenses of the company), this would  have  resulted  in  the
         Appellant's dividend entitlement being lower.   Therefore,  if  the
         accounting error had not occurred the Appellant's aggregate  income
         would have been higher than that which was actually declared in his
         application dated 24th March 2011."

 8. Judge Khawar found that the Secretary of State's  conclusion  that  the
    Claimant's application would have been refused as  he  would  not  been
    awarded the 80 points under Appendix A of  the  Immigration  Rules  was
    wholly  misconceived.   The  Secretary  of  State  had  not  sought  to
    distinguish between the income/profit figure of the limited company and
    those relating to the Claimant's personal financial affairs  and  found
    that there was confusion in the Secretary of  State's  analysis  within
    the refusal letter.  Judge Khawar was not satisfied that  the  decision
    to refuse under paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules was made  out
    and went on to allow the appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR.

    The Grounds of Appeal

 9. The Secretary of State now seeks to appeal that  decision.  Within  the
    Grounds of Appeal, which Ms Isherwood simply seeks to rely upon  today,
    it is argued  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  made  a  material
    misdirection in law.  It was said  that  the  Secretary  of  State  had
    originally refused the application due to discrepancies in  the  amount
    of self-declared income to UKVI and to HMRC for tax purposes  and  that
    the Judge materially erred by absolving the Claimant of any  blame  for
    his failure to correctly declare his self-employed income to  HMRC  and
    that therefore the assessment of the  Claimant's  actions  and  whether
    they amounted just to dishonesty was flawed.  The  Secretary  of  State
    relies upon the recent Upper Tribunal case of R (on the application  of
    Khan) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  (dishonest,  tax
    return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 00384 and the finding there  that
    a Claimant is personally responsible for their own tax affairs and  the
    headnotes paragraphs(i) and (v) of Khan that,

         "(i) That where there has been a significant difference between the
             income claimed in a previous application for leave  to  remain
             and the income declared to HMRC, the  Secretary  of  State  is
             entitled to draw an inference  that  the  Appellant  has  been
             deceitful or dishonest and therefore he should be refused  ILR
             within paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules.   Such  an
             inference could  be  expected  where  there  is  no  plausible
             explanation for discrepancy."

         "(v) When considering whether or not the applicant is dishonest  or
             merely careless the Secretary of  State  should  consider  the
             following matters, inter alia, as well as the extent to  which
             they are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):

             i.   Whether the explanation for the error by  the  accountant
                  is plausible;

             ii.  Whether the documentation which can be assumed  to  exist
                  (for example, correspondence between the applicant and his
                  accountant at  the  time  of  the  tax  return)  has  been
                  disclosed or whether there is a plausible  explanation  as
                  to why it is missing;

             iii. Why the applicant did not realise an error had been  made
                  because his liability to pay tax was less than  he  should
                  have expected;

             iv.  Whether at any stage the applicant  has  taken  steps  to
                  remedy the situation and, if so,  when  those  steps  were
                  taken and the explanation for any significant delay."

10. It is argued by the Secretary of State that the Judge has not  followed
    the recommended steps in Khan when assessing the Claimant's actions and
    that there was no documentation to demonstrate why  the  error  of  the
    accountant had occurred and no explanation was argued  as  to  why  the
    Claimant did not realise the error sooner.  It is argued that the Judge
    erred in finding that paragraph 322(5) did not apply in this case.




    My findings on error of law and materiality

11. The difficulty with the Secretary of State's appeal is  that  when  one
    reads the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Khawar in its entirety,
    he makes it clear at paragraph 26 of the decision that the Secretary of
    State did not seek  to  assert  deception/dishonesty  on  the  part  of
    Claimant and at paragraphs 28 through to 31 inclusive when setting  out
    the material part of the refusal letter and the fact that the  Claimant
    had been refused on the basis that his character and  conduct  made  it
    undesirable for him to be allowed to remain in the United Kingdom under
    paragraph 322(5), Judge Khawar specifically found that  no  explanation
    had been proffered as to why an accounting error on  the  part  of  the
    Claimant led to the inference that his character/conduct was  so  badly
    tarnished that it would be appropriate to refuse his application  under
    paragraph 322(5) of the Rules.  Judge Khawar specifically noted that he
    had asked the Home Office Presenting Officer why it was that accounting
    errors reflected so badly on Mr Ali's character/behaviour as to warrant
    refusal, but the Judge found at paragraph 31 of the decision  that  the
    Home Office Presenting Officer was able to explain why such  accounting
    errors would mean that this Claimant's character or behaviour warranted
    refusal under 322(5).

12. The point under consideration in the case of Khan was whether or not in
    a judicial review case, the Secretary of State was actually entitled to
    draw an inference that a  Claimant  had  been  deceitful/dishonest  and
    should  be  refused  ILR  within  paragraph  322(5)  on  the  basis  of
    differences between income claimed in a previous application for  leave
    to remain and income declared to the HMRC.  The  whole  point  of  that
    case was that  the  Secretary  of  State  was  entitled  to  draw  that
    distinction and take those differences and discrepancies  into  account
    in considering  whether  or  not  a  Claimant  had  been  deceitful  or
    dishonest.  The Court gave guidance as to how the  Secretary  of  State
    should carry out the consideration as to whether or not a Claimant  was
    dishonest, or merely careless.

13. However, in this case the Secretary of State was not seeking  to  argue
    that Mr Ali had been dishonest or exercised deception.  That  was  made
    clear by Judge Khawar at paragraph 26.  He also clearly  asked  why  it
    was that the accounting error reflected so badly on Mr Ali's  character
    or behaviour as to warrant refusal. The Home Office Presenting  Officer
    at the First-tier Tribunal did not seek to argue that the errors should
    be treated as evidence of deception or dishonesty on the part of Mr Ali
    that should be held against him for the purposes of paragraph 322(5).

14. Although within the refusal letter it was stated that had the amount of
    �14,403 been declared to the Home Office, the  application  would  have
    been refused, as he would not have been awarded the required 80  points
    under Appendix A of the Immigration Rules, Judge Khawar dealt with that
    as I have stated in finding that the  limited  company's  profits  were
    inadvertently under-declared and that if the accounting error  had  not
    occurred the Appellant's aggregate income would have been  higher  than
    was actually declared in the application dated 24th March 2011.

15. Clearly, in this case, had the Secretary of State sought to argue  that
    the accounting errors were evidence of dishonesty or deception, then in
    that case Judge Khawar would have been duty bound  to  have  considered
    the case of Khan.   But  in  this  case  the  Secretary  of  State  was
    specifically saying he did not seek to assert deception and  dishonesty
    and Judge Khawar specifically asked the basis upon which  it  was  said
    that paragraph 322(5) applied and the Home  Office  Presenting  Officer
    could not give an explanation for that at the First-tier Tribunal.  The
    case of Khan is a case which considers whether or not  conduct  amounts
    to deception or dishonesty as opposed to simple carelessness.  In  this
    case dishonesty and deception were not being argued,  as  was  told  to
    Judge Khawar and no explanation could be given as to why it  was  being
    said that 322(5) applied other than the fact  that  there  had  been  a
    discrepancy in the sums declared.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  in
    those circumstances was not wrong in failing to consider  the  case  of
    Khan. The Judge was not being asked to consider  if  the  Claimant  was
    dishonest or merely careless.  In this case dishonesty  was  not  being
    put forward at the appeal hearing  as  the  reason  as  to  why  322(5)
    applied. It was simply being put forward that the  discrepancy  in  the
    sums declared in itself was  sufficient.   That  in  itself  would  not
    justify refusal under 322(5).

16. Where the Home  Office  Presenting  Officer  could  not  say  why  such
    accounting errors should mean refusal under 322(5), then  Judge  Khawar
    quite properly found that 322(5) did not apply in the circumstances  of
    this case, based on the way the  case  was  presented  to  him  by  the
    Secretary of State and on the basis of what he was asked  to  consider.
    He did not fail to consider Khan. Although  he  did  not  consider  the
    case, it was not a failure or legal error in this case as Khan did  not
    apply, as the Secretary of State was not seeking to rely upon deception
    or dishonesty and was simply seeking to rely upon a discrepancy in  the
    accounts.  One cannot simply read into the refusal letter that there is
    an allegation of deception or dishonesty.  That is a serious matter and
    should actually be stated within the refusal letter if  that  is  being
    relied upon.  It was not in this case and the  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer at first instance was not seeking to say that the Claimant  had
    utilised deception or dishonesty.

17. For those reasons, the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Khawar
    does not reveal any material error  of  law  and  is  maintained.   The
    appeal of the Secretary of State is dismissed.

Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Khawar  does  not  contain  any
material error of law and the decision  is  maintained.   The  Secretary  of
State's appeal is dismissed.

I do not make any order for anonymity in this case, no such order  was  made
by the First-tier Tribunal and no such  order  has  been  sought  before  me
today.
