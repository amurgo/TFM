For the Appellant:      Mr A Mullen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:     Mr T Maleque, of Bruce Short, Solicitors

No anonymity order requested or made.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) This determination refers to parties  as  they  were  in  the  First-tier
   Tribunal.

2) On 12 July 2011 the appellant applied to enter the UK as a  fiancï¿½  (i.e.
   with a view to marriage and permanent settlement in the UK) in  terms  of
   paragraph 290 of the Immigration Rules.

3) The respondent refused that application  by  notice  dated  13  September
   2012, not being satisfied in terms of paragraph 290 (iv)  and  (vi)  that
   adequate maintenance and accommodation without recourse to  public  funds
   would be available to the appellant until the date of the  marriage,  nor
   that  the  parties  would  be  able,  after  the  marriage,  to  maintain
   themselves and dependants adequately without recourse to public funds.

4) First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Reid  allowed  the  appeal  by  determination
   promulgated on 23 January 2014, under paragraph 290  of  the  Immigration
   Rules 290 and under Article 8 of ECHR.

5) These are the SSHD's grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal:

    Failing to give reasons or adequate reasons for findings on a  material
    matter


           a) The judge concludes that  the  appellant  has  satisfied  the
              Immigration Rules on the basis of the  evidence  provided  at
              appeal ... the evidence at the date of the  [Entry  Clearance
              Officer's] decision was inadequate and the judge should  have
              considered the appeal on that basis.


           b) Furthermore the findings in  respect  of  Article  8  do  not
              establish exceptional circumstances and do not establish that
              it would be unreasonable to expect the  appellant  to  comply
              with  the  conditions  of  a  firm  and  coherent  system  of
              immigration  control  by  making  a  fresh  application  with
              sufficient evidence of his ability to satisfy the Rules.

6) In a response dated 25 February  2014  under  Rule  24  of  the  Tribunal
   Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  the  appellant  said  that  the
   documents on which Judge Reid based her decision had all been before  the
   ECO.

7) Mr Mullen accepted that the point  made  in  the  Rule  24  response  was
   correct, and that appeal ground (a) arose out of a misconception.   There
   was thus nothing to show any error in  the  appeal  having  been  allowed
   under the Rules.  The finding under Article 8 was in the alternative, and
   beside the point.

8) The determination of the First-tier Tribunal,  allowing  the  appellant's
   appeal, shall stand.
