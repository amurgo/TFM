                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State I  will  refer  to
    the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 13th March 1986. In 2011
    he was working in Cyprus and met his future wife, Mrs  Lisa  Munir  nee
    Warren. He married his wife on 12th March 2012 in  Cyprus.  He  applied
    for a visit visa to come to the UK to see his wife and her  family  but
    this was refused. On 18th May 2012 she moved  to  Cyprus  to  join  him
    there leaving her job with the Department of Work and Pensions  in  the
    UK. They were both issued  with  EU  residence  cards  by  the  Cypriot
    authorities, but then the economy of Cyprus crashed and  the  appellant
    was made redundant.

 3. On 13th February 2013 the appellant and Mrs  Munir  moved  to  Ireland.
    Between June and November 2013 the appellant's wife worked in  a  take-
    away (the Village Takeaway) and for a foreign exchange company  (Aftab)
    and the appellant also had employment. They were both  issued  with  EU
    residence cards by the Irish authorities.

 4. On 5th December 2013 the couple moved to the UK as the appellant's wife
    was pregnant and unwell.  He applied for an EU residence card in the UK
    on 7th January 2014. This application was refused on  7th  March  2014,
    and he appealed on 20th March 2014. On  26th  June  2014  the  couple's
    baby, Ayshah Jenna Munir was born. His appeal  was  allowed  under  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 (henceforth the EEA Regulations) and
    on human rights ground in a determination of Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Majid promulgated on 31st October 2014.

 5. On 15th December 2014 Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Pooler  found
    that there was an arguable error of law because  the  determination  of
    Judge Majid failed to identify the issues  under  appeal  and  to  give
    adequate reasoning for his findings. It was also arguable that he  took
    into account immaterial information and failed to make clear whether he
    was allowing the appeal on asylum or EEA grounds or both.

 6. The matter came before me to determine whether the First-tier  Tribunal
    had erred in law.

Submissions - Error of Law

 7. Mr Shilliday submitted that the determination was fundamentally flawed,
    and that he had seen the same determination issued by  Judge  Majid  in
    six other cases. As set out in the grounds of appeal Judge  Majid  does
    not set out what the issues in  the  appeal  are  or  the  reasons  for
    allowing the appeal.

 8. More specifically the determination errs in law as it is inadequate  to
    say the appellant had not lost her  qualified  status  on  moving  from
    Ireland for the reasons set out in the appellant's skeleton argument as
    is done at paragraphs 10(b) and 12. No  reason  is  given  why  medical
    treatment prevents suspension of qualified worker status.

 9. At paragraph 15, 16(c) and (d) Judge Majid sets out irrelevant material
    of an overtly political nature; paragraphs 18 and 16(b) are unclear  in
    their meaning; and paragraphs 10(a) & (c), 12 and 18 all indicate  that
    Judge Majid did not  understand  paragraph  117B  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and the public interest in  maintaining
    immigration control.

10. Mr Shilliday said that the irregularities in the determination were  so
    grotesque that in fact neither party had been given a fair  hearing  in
    the First-tier Tribunal and so the matter should be remitted for  a  de
    novo hearing.

11. I indicated to Ms Smith I was inclined to find that  the  determination
    was too confused and failed to set out and determine the  issues  under
    appeal with adequate reasons subject to any submissions she  wished  to
    make. I asked if she would like to take instructions from the appellant
    as to whether he would like to go with the suggestion of Mr  Shilliday,
    or whether she wished to continue and defend the determination of Judge
    Majid. Ms Smith took instructions.

12. Ms Smith then said she recognised that there were difficulties with the
    determination.  After taking further instructions  from  the  appellant
    and his wife she said that the appellant conceded the Judge  Majid  had
    erred  in  law  in  the  determination  of  the  appeal  and  that  the
    determination would have to be set  aside,  but  that  she  wished  the
    matter to be re-made in the Upper Tribunal as the appellant's wife  was
    unwell and the couple wanted the matter resolved as soon as possible.

13. I told the parties that the determination of Judge Majid would  be  set
    aside in its entirety as it disclosed multiple errors of  law,  as  set
    out below, and that I would remake the appeal in the Upper Tribunal.  I
    had regard to the Senior President's Practice Statement on Remittals at
    paragraph 7.2. Whilst the determination did contain a large  number  of
    legal errors both parties had had the opportunity to put their case  in
    the First-tier; the extent of the judicial fact-finding to re-make  was
    not great; and in all the circumstances it  was  right  to  follow  the
    normal course of remaking in the Upper Tribunal.

Conclusions - Error of Law

14. The primary issue under appeal was the entitlement of the appellant  to
    an EU residence card under Regulation 17 of the EEA  Regulations,  with
    reference to Regulation 9 of the EEA Regulations and  "Surinder  Singh"
    principles.  Also  of  relevance  is  Regulation  6(2)(a)  of  the  EEA
    Regulations (as the appellant's wife is unwell), the case  of  Minister
    voor  Vereemdelingenzaken  en  Integratie  v   Eind   C-291/05  as  the
    appellant's wife is not working and the case  of  Jessy  Saint  Prix  v
    Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  C-507/12 as  the  appellant's
    wife was pregnant and is  now  on  maternity  leave.  These  cases  and
    Regulations were all set out in the appellant's skeleton  argument  but
    there is no reference to any of them in the determination. It  was  not
    possible to determine this appeal without reference to  this  framework
    and making findings of fact in relation to these issues:  as  a  result
    Judge Majid erred in law by failing to do so.

15. The conclusion of Judge Majid at paragraph 19 that  the  appellant  can
    benefit from the EEA Regulations errs in law for want of  any  relevant
    reasoning relating to the framework in EU law and its enactment in  the
    EEA Regulations.

16. Mr Shilliday has rightly pointed out that there is a  large  amount  of
    irrelevant material apparently considered in relation to human  rights.
    One example is as follows. The appellant has made  no  claim  that  his
    removal from the UK would breach Article 3 ECHR and yet paragraph 15 of
    the determination concerns the case of Chahal v UK [1996] ECHR 54.

17. The analysis under Article 8 ECHR is confused with  references  to  the
    EEA Regulations and consists largely  of  an  attempt  to  discuss  the
    introduction of Immigration Rules relating to Article 8 ECHR and s.117B
    of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.  There  is  no
    analysis of the appellant's facts applying the new Rules or following a
    Razgar analysis. I therefore find that  Judge  Majid  errs  in  law  in
    relation to his finding that the appellant  succeeds  under  Article  8
    ECHR due to lack of reference to the legal framework and the failure to
    make relevant findings of fact supporting this conclusion.

18. The determination of Judge Majid is set aside in its entirety.

Evidence & Submissions - Remaking

19. The appellant attended the Tribunal and gave evidence. He confirmed his
    two statements are true and correct and his evidence to  the  Tribunal.
    In summary in addition to the material set out in the  introduction  he
    says that he and Mrs Munir live with  their  daughter  at  his  in-laws
    place. His wife is still recovering from her  caesarean  section.  They
    are able to live from the rental income from Mrs Munir's flat. They are
    intending to release some equity from this flat and set up a restaurant
    in the UK as he has studied hotel and restaurant management, and worked
    in restaurants in Cyprus and Ireland. He is very keen  to  be  able  to
    work and support his family. They are all settled here with friends and
    close relationships with Mrs Munir's parents.

20. In answer to questions the appellant explained that he and his wife had
    EU residence cards in Cyprus because his wife had shown she was a  job-
    seeker by getting a job offer from his boss (although she actually  did
    not take up the work as she decided to take a holiday) and because  she
    showed evidence that she had an income from  the  flat  she  owned  and
    rented out in the UK. She rented the flat in the UK for �625  a  month,
    which gave her about 800 Euros, which was a reasonable amount  to  live
    on in Cyprus.

21. The appellant also explained that his wife was currently unable to work
    as she had a hip problem and needed a hip operation. She was  in  agony
    and unable to work until she received this treatment.

22. Both parties agreed that there was no need for  any  further  evidence,
    but both Mrs Munir and  her  father  Mr  Warren  confirmed  that  their
    statements were true and correct, and their evidence to the Tribunal.

23. Mr Shilliday submitted that he accepted that Mrs  Munir  had  exercised
    Treaty rights in Ireland. He said he was satisfied that she was  an  EU
    worker there particularly as she had also exercised Treaty rights prior
    to this in Cyprus. The only  issue,  which  he  did  not  conceded  was
    whether she was still exercising Treaty rights in  the  UK.  He  relied
    upon the reasons for refusal letter in  relation  to  this  issue,  and
    noted the possible relevance of the case of St Prix. The refusal letter
    states that the appellant had not supplied sufficient evidence to  show
    that his wife is exercising Treaty rights in the UK,  and  particularly
    had not shown she  was  an  incapacitated  worker  in  accordance  with
    Regulation 5(3) of the EEA Regulations as there was no medical evidence
    that Mrs Munir was permanently incapacitated and no  evidence  she  had
    resided in the  UK  for  a  period  of  two  years  prior  to  becoming
    incapacitated.

24. Mr Shilliday submitted that it was not appropriate for me  to  continue
    and determine the appeal under Article 8 ECHR.

25. Ms Smith relied upon her skeleton argument. Ms Smith  argued  that  the
    appellant's wife was exercising Treaty rights in the UK  in  accordance
    with St Prix and Eind. The appellant's wife was still  within  the  one
    year maternity leave period permitted in the UK and it  was  clear  she
    had given up work due to her pregnancy. It was clear that the appellant
    and Mrs Munir had had the centre of their lives firstly in  Cyprus  and
    then in Ireland. Under Regulation 13 there is  no  further  requirement
    that the appellant's wife be exercising Treaty rights in the UK  to  be
    admitted with her family member. The appellant has never claimed to  be
    permanently  incapacitated  so  this  is  irrelevant.  If  it  were   a
    requirement that the appellant's wife be currently a worker, she  could
    qualify as she is temporarily unable to work due to her  ill-health  in
    accordance with Regulation 6(2)(a) of the EEA Regulations.

26. Ms Smith submitted that it was appropriate for me to  continue  on  and
    determine the matter under Article 8 ECHR even if I allowed the  appeal
    under the  EEA  Regulations  as  otherwise  an  appeal  under  the  EEA
    Regulations might leave the appellant with no leave  rather  than  with
    discretionary  leave  (if  the  Article  8  ECHR   determination   were
    unchallenged) and thus prolong the period the appellant was  unable  to
    work. She submitted that the appellant could meet the  requirements  of
    the ten year route under Appendix FM of the  Immigration  Rules.  There
    would be insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  taking  place  in
    Pakistan given  societal  attitudes  to  women  and  it  would  not  be
    reasonable to expect her to relocate there with her baby. The appellant
    was entitled to succeed in accordance with s.117B of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

Conclusions - Remaking

27. It is accepted by Mr Shilliday that Mrs Munir resided in two EU  states
    prior to returning to the UK, and that she was a worker in the Republic
    of Ireland. I am satisfied that she was granted a residence certificate
    in Cyprus on the basis of  being  a  jobseeker  and  a  self-sufficient
    person: I have seen documentation regarding  the  income  she  received
    from the rented flat she owns in the UK. She was  granted  a  residence
    certificate and the appellant was  granted  a  residence  card  as  her
    spouse, and copies of the Cypriot EEA residence  documentation  are  in
    the bundle. Mrs Munir was also granted a residence certificate  in  the
    Republic of Ireland and worked there for two different employers.   She
    has provided evidence both of her  work  in  the  Republic  of  Ireland
    (certificate of pay, tax etc for year ending 31st December 2013, letter
    of employment, P45,  employment  contract,  payslips),  and  her  Irish
    residence certificate, and the appellant's Irish residence card.

28. I therefore find that Mrs Munir can satisfy Regulation 9(2)(a)  of  the
    EEA Regulations as she was residing in an EEA state as a worker  before
    returning to the UK.

29. I also find that the appellant can satisfy Regulation  9(2)(b)  of  the
    EEA Regulations as it is not contested that he is  the  spouse  of  Mrs
    Munir. I am satisfied that they lived together in  Cyprus  and  Ireland
    before travelling to the UK and that they had the centre of their  life
    in these countries before returning to the UK given the evidence of the
    appellant and Mrs Munir,  and  the  supporting  documentation  set  out
    below.

30. The appellant has  supplied  evidence  of  his  regular  work  in  both
    countries in the form of payslips;  joint  bank  statements  show  many
    transactions for matters such as shopping and eating out  and  payments
    of salary; there is evidence of their having  rented  accommodation  in
    both countries in the form of rental agreements; there are also utility
    bills and identity numbers enabling them  to  access  Irish  government
    services. It is the evidence of the appellant and Mrs Munir  that  they
    went to live permanently in Cyprus and only moved to Ireland due to the
    economic crash there; and then only left Ireland  due  to  the  medical
    complications of Mrs Munir's  pregnancy  which  meant  she  needed  the
    assistance of her parents as a result of  her  pre-existing  scoliosis.
    There are medical letters from Mrs Munir's GP  from  the  time  of  her
    return to the UK which confirm she was temporarily incapacitated  as  a
    result of her scoliosis which has been aggravated by her pregnancy  and
    for which she was receiving  physiotherapy  and  that  she  needed  the
    support of her family.

31. As such it is therefore clear that the appellant  and  Mrs  Munir  were
    entitled to be treated as an EEA national and spouse  under  Regulation
    13 (initial right of residence) on their return to the UK as set out at
    Regulation 9(4) of the EEA Regulations.

32. The  question  then  arises  as  to  whether  Mrs  Munir  is  currently
    exercising  Treaty  rights  so  as  to  be  a  qualified  person  under
    Regulation 6 of the EEA Regulations. I find that Mrs Munir only gave up
    her work in Ireland due to her pregnancy related  ill-health.  This  is
    her credible evidence which  is  supported  by  GP  letters.  As  these
    letters and she state she became temporarily incapacitated as a  result
    of her underlying scoliosis  and  her  pregnancy.  Later  letters  from
    Benenden Hospital Trust refer to Mrs Munir needing  a  hip  replacement
    following the  birth  of  her  daughter  and  in  the  context  of  her
    scoliosis, and state that until this is done she is unable to  take  up
    employment due to her painful arthritis. In her  latest  statement  Mrs
    Munir says she is still recovering from her caesarean section and  that
    she will look for work once she is well and her  baby  a  little  older
    (Ayshah is currently 7 months old). Her parents  have  agreed  to  look
    after Ayshah whilst she works when she is  ready  to  return  to  work.
    There is documentary evidence before me that Mrs Munir  had  previously
    worked for the Department of Work and Pensions in the UK in the form of
    payslips, P45 and P60 and certificate commending her on her ten  years'
    service ending in April 2012 together with a glowing reference.

33. I am satisfied on the evidence before me that Mrs  Munir  is  currently
    temporarily unable to work due to ill-health, and thus qualifies to  be
    seen as a worker under Regulation 6(1)(b) of  the  EEA  Regulations  by
    virtue of Regulation 6(2)(a).

34. My opinion that Mrs Munir continues  to  be  treated  as  a  worker  is
    further supported by the fact that in the  European  Court  of  Justice
    ruled in St Prix that: "a woman who gives up  work,  or  seeking  work,
    because of the physical constraints of the late stages of pregnancy and
    the aftermath of childbirth retains the status of  worker,  within  the
    mean of that Article, provided she returns to work or finds another job
    within a reasonable period after the birth of her child."

35. I find that Mrs Munir is within the reasonable period after  the  birth
    of her child as maternity leave in the UK allows  for  a  break  of  52
    weeks with 4 weeks prior to the expected date of  birth  of  the  child
    counting towards this 52 week break if the  mother  is  off  sick  with
    pregnancy related illnesses  (information  from  Gov.UK  website).  Mrs
    Munir's maternity leave would therefore  continue  until  approximately
    the 26th May 2015, and I find that she continues  to  be  a  worker  up
    until this time in all the circumstances of her case particularly given
    her intention to  return  to  work  when  well,  her  arrangements  for
    childcare and her history of employment.

36. Ms Smith has also drawn my attention to  the  fact  that  the  European
    Court of Justice in Eind has  also  held  that  where  an  EU  national
    exercises Treaty rights as a worker in another community state and then
    returns to her home member state that she is entitled to install  third
    country national family members whether  or  not  she  is  economically
    active on her return.  This  is  particularly  clear  from  the  second
    conclusion and from paragraph 38 of the judgement which  states:  "Miss
    Eind (a national of Surinam) has the right to install herself with  her
    father, Mr Eind,  in  the  Netherlands,  even  if  the  latter  is  not
    economically active."

37. I thus conclude that the appellant is  entitled  to  a  residence  card
    under Regulation 17(1) of  the  EEA  Regulations  as  Mrs  Munir  is  a
    qualified person under Regulation 6(1)(b) of the EEA Regulations and he
    is her spouse under Regulation 7(1)(a) of the EEA Regulations.

38. I make it clear I am more than satisfied that  the  appellant  and  Mrs
    Munir have family life together; and that any removal  would  interfere
    with that family life; and if I am right in my  above  analysis  of  EU
    law, and the appellant is  entitled  to  a  residence  card,  that  any
    removal would not be in accordance with the law and thus  a  breach  of
    Article 8 ECHR.

39. However in considering Article 8 ECHR as a separate ground of appeal  I
    must first consider this matter under the Immigration Rules relating to
    family life under Article 8 ECHR at Appendix FM and with s.117B of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002.   I  find  that  I  have
    insufficient material before me to conclude that the appellant can meet
    the requirements at EX 1 of Appendix FM that it would not be reasonable
    for the appellant's child to relocate to Pakistan or that  there  would
    be insurmountable obstacles to family life with Mrs Munir continuing in
    Pakistan. This is because I have no information about  the  appellant's
    family circumstances in Pakistan. Whilst I appreciate that Mrs Munir is
    significantly unwell and has never been to Pakistan I have no  detailed
    information setting out what the family  situation  would  be  in  that
    country or setting out details  of  her  access  to  medical  treatment
    there.

40. I appreciate that it can be appropriate to  look  at  the  general  law
    relating to Article 8 ECHR outside of the Immigration Rules however the
    outcome would not be different as in assessing the  proportionality  of
    any interference with the appellant's family life I  would  once  again
    need to understand the situation  to  which  they  would  be  going  in
    Pakistan in order to find it was not reasonable to expect  family  life
    to take place in that country.
