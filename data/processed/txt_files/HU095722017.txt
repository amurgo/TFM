               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Walsh, Counsel
For the Respondent:    M E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW

1.   The appellant has been granted permission to  appeal  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge  Kaler  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    respondent's refusal to grant him leave to remain in the  UK  on  human
    rights grounds.

2.   Mr Tufan agreed with Mr Walsh's submission that  the  judge  failed  to
    consider the best interests of the appellant's  child,  [CD],  who  was
    born in the UK on 25 July 2011.

3.   I find  that  this  error  was  material  and  undermined  the  judge's
    assessment of the appellant's human rights claim.

4.   Accordingly, the judge's decision cannot stand.  It  is  set  aside  in
    order to be remade.

5.   The appellant's appeal is remitted to Taylor House for rehearing  by  a
    judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Kaler.

No anonymity direction is made.


Signed                                  Date:  20 December 2018
