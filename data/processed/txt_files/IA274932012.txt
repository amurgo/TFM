For the Appellant:     Not present or represented
For the Respondent:    Ms M Tanner, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who  was  born  on  28  December
    1986.  The current appeal arises from a refusal  by  the  Secretary  of
    State to grant the appellant leave to remain following his  application
    made on 23 April 2012 to remain as a Tier 4 (General)  Student  Migrant
    under the points-based system.  That decision was  appealed  and  there
    was an oral hearing before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Chana.   In  a
    determination dated 10 April 2013 the appeal was dismissed.   The  date
    of decision was 19 November 2012.

 2. The appellant sought permission to appeal the decision of the judge and
    permission was granted.  In  essence  the  grounds  seeking  permission
    stated  that  the  appellant  submitted  his  application  on  an   old
    application  form  which  the  respondent  said  was  not  valid.   The
    appellant was not aware of changes that had taken place.  The judge did
    not accept the appellant's factual account that he had made an  in-time
    application.  The appellant's leave to remain expired on 14 April  2012
    and the judge decided that the appellant therefore  no  longer  had  an
    established presence enabling him to benefit from the lower maintenance
    requirement granted to those with an established  presence  who  submit
    their application before leave expires.

 3. The appellant  submitted  accounts  which  contended  that  he  was  in
    possession of more than �9,000 for the  requisite  period.   The  judge
    decided the appellant did not meet the requirements of the  Immigration
    Rules in that he needed to show �9,000 and any outstanding fees at date
    of application.  It was found arguable by the judge granting permission
    that common law issues of fairness required the Tribunal to look  again
    at the situation because the appellant had the  appropriate  amount  at
    the time and there were difficulties that he experienced in putting his
    application forward on the correct form.

 4. The respondent filed a Rule  24  response  submitting  that  the  judge
    directed herself appropriately and made findings open  to  her  on  the
    evidence before her.  The bank statements were not put before the judge
    and this does not show that the judge made a material error of law.

The Hearing before me

 5. On the day of hearing there was no appearance by or on  behalf  of  the
    appellant but there is in the file a letter  from  him  dated  20  June
    2013, which was received on 25 June 2013 asking for a  decision  to  be
    made on "written papers".  In the circumstances I decided  to  proceed.
    Ms Tanner represented the respondent.

 6. The contents of the letter from the appellant dated 20 June 2013 are to
    the effect that he applied for an extension to remain in the UK  on  11
    April 2012 and this was before the expiry date of his visa which was 14
    April 2012.  There was an acknowledgement letter  from  the  respondent
    that was issued on 17 April  2012.   The  appellant  thought  that  his
    application was valid because he had applied before his  visa  expired,
    so he only needed to show funds for two months  in  his  bank  account.
    However, the application was returned to him so that he  could  provide
    the correct fees but by that time his visa had expired.

 7. The application was returned to the respondent on 23 April  2012.   The
    appellant was not aware that he had to show maintenance funds for  nine
    months because he has an established presence in the UK.  According  to
    the Secretary of State the  bank  statement  provided  shows  that  the
    appellant only had �8,768.07 at the time and therefore he had not shown
    that he was in  possession  of  the  required  funds  of  �9,000.   The
    appellant needed just �232 more to meet the required standard.  He  was
    not aware that he had to show �9,000 and in fact he had �384.89 in  his
    bank account from 24 March 2012 onwards  and  that  together  with  the
    other amount shown comes to more than �9,000.  The  appellant  provided
    evidence in support of the contentions set out in the letter.

 8. If the appellant had appeared before me I would have explained  to  him
    that this is not a rehearing of his appeal  but  a  hearing  to  decide
    whether the First-tier Tribunal Judge made such errors in her  decision
    that the Upper Tribunal ought to set it aside and remake it.

 9. An important feature of the points-based system is  that  it  specifies
    the evidence that must be produced with the  application  in  order  to
    demonstrate that the criteria are met.  This system can and does  bring
    about what appear to be harsh decisions but it is an  inherent  feature
    of the  points-based  system  that  all  appropriate  documentation  is
    supplied at date of application because the system puts  a  premium  on
    predictability and certainty at the expense of discretion.

10. Although the appellant refers to the fact that he made his  application
    prior to the expiry of his leave this was not accepted by the judge and
    she gave  reasons  for  making  that  finding.   Whether  he  made  the
    application  during  the  existence  of  his  current  leave   or   not
    unfortunately he did so on  an  outdated  form  and  did  not  pay  the
    increased fee that had very recently been imposed (from 6 April  2013).



11. Notice of the invalid immigration application was sent to the appellant
    by letter dated 17 April 2012.  According to the letter the application
    form and all supporting documents were returned to the  appellant.   He
    then made a valid application but by that time it was out of date.   It
    took the respondent some seven months to finally  make  a  decision  to
    refuse the application.

12. The appellant claimed 10 points for maintenance (funds) but was awarded
    none.  This was on the basis  that  he  did  not  have  an  established
    presence studying in the UK because at the date of his  application  he
    did not have current entry clearance, leave to enter or leave to remain
    as a Tier 4 Migrant.  This is by reason of the fact that when  he  made
    his valid application, and this appears to have been on 23 April  2012,
    his current leave had already expired.  Therefore  the  requirement  to
    show fewer funds that applies to those  who  can  show  an  established
    presence did not apply to this appellant.  Although he may have had  in
    his possession sufficient funds at the date of his  (late)  application
    he did not provide that evidence  at  the  time  and  the  Tribunal  is
    prevented from taking that evidence into account by section 85A of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

13. In the circumstances therefore I am unable to find that the judge erred
    in the manner in which she dealt with the  appeal.   That  finding  is,
    however, subject to one matter and that  is  that  in  the  grounds  in
    support of the original appeal the appellant at  paragraph  5  asserted
    that because the appellant applied before his visa expired he should be
    given a right of appeal "as this removal will infringe his rights under
    Article 8 of ECHR".  The judge did not deal with Article 8 but  on  the
    other hand there has been no expansion upon the Article  8  claim  such
    that the failure to consider it might have brought  about  a  different
    result.  There was simply no information before the  judge  that  might
    have led to a finding in favour of the appellant under Article 8 ECHR.

Decision

14. The First-tier Tribunal Judge did not  err  in  such  a  way  that  the
    decision should be remade by  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  therefore  the
    decision to dismiss the appeal stands.

15. No anonymity direction is made. None was sought and in  the  particular
    circumstances none appears to be warranted.
