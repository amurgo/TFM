For the Respondent:    Ms Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is  a  national  of  Namibia  born  in  1996.   He  seeks
    international protection on the grounds that as a gay man he has a well-
    founded fear of persecution there for reasons of his membership of that
    particular group. His appeal was dismissed by the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Mark Davies) on the 18th March 2020.  Permission  to  appeal  to
    this Tribunal was granted on the 30th July 2020.




    Background and Matters in Issue

 2. By her decision of  the  6th  November  2019  the  Secretary  of  State
    accepted the following factual claims as made out:

           a) That the Appellant is gay;
           b) That he left Namibia in order to escape an arranged  marriage
              to a female cousin and/or the problems he would  face  if  he
              refused the union.


    The background to (b), set out by the Secretary of State and implicitly
    accepted, was that the Appellant's  father  had  already  in  the  past
    subjected him to beatings and threats because he  believed  him  to  be
    gay.  The only matter placed in issue by the refusal letter was whether
    gay men per se face a real, that is to say objective, risk  of  serious
    harm in Namibia.

 3. By its decision of the 18th March 2020 the First-tier Tribunal was  not
    satisfied that there was before it evidence capable of demonstrating  a
    real risk of harm to gay men in Namibia. The Tribunal commented that in
    particular there was no evidence to show  that  those  who  refused  to
    enter into arranged marriages were subject to what is  known  in  other
    contexts as 'honour' based violence. If  the  Appellant's  family  were
    looking for him it had not been shown that this was in order to do  him
    harm.  If he wished to avoid marriage to his cousin it was open to  him
    to move elsewhere in Namibia, where  attitudes  to  homosexuality  were
    becoming ever more liberal: in this regard the Judge concluded that the
    Appellant could live "without difficulty" in  Windhoek.  He  would  not
    face prosecution for "sodomy"[1]. In fact, if he wished to live in  the
    capital he would receive support from the LGBT community living  there.
    On these grounds the appeal was dismissed.


 4. This appeal is firstly  brought  on  the  ground  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal failed to apply the Demirkaya principle set out  at  paragraph
    339K of the Immigration Rules. The Respondent had already accepted that
    the Appellant had been mistreated by his family in  Namibia,  including
    being beaten and threatened with further harm. Although on one  reading
    the Tribunal had assumed that this would place him at risk in his  home
    area of Ojtinene - why else would it proceed  to  considering  internal
    flight to Windhoek? - the Tribunal's findings on this past  persecution
    were not in fact clear.

 5. The second ground is that in concurring with the Respondent's  analysis
    that gay men do not face a real risk of harm in  Namibia  the  Tribunal
    has failed to have regard  to  relevant  background  information.  This
    including research cited in the CPIN that 14% of MSM Namibians had been
    raped, 21% blackmailed and 22% beaten by the police or other government
    representatives.



    Error of Law: Discussion and Findings

      Demirkaya

 6. Paragraph 339K of the Immigration Rules gives effect to the judgment of
    the Court of Appeal in Demirkaya v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [1999] EWCA Civ 1654:


         339K. The fact that a person has already been subject to
         persecution or serious harm, or to direct threats of such
         persecution or such harm, will be regarded as a serious indication
         of the person's well-founded fear of persecution or real risk of
         suffering serious harm, unless there are good reasons to consider
         that such persecution or serious harm will not be repeated.


 7. It was the Appellant's case that when his family discovered him  to  be
    gay his father "almost killed" him [AIR 47]: he beat  him  and  whipped
    him with electric wires  [AIR  81].   The  Appellant  was  subsequently
    threatened with more violence, should  he  fail  to  marry  his  female
    cousin as his family had arranged. On appeal  the  Appellant  submitted
    that this violence, and the threats of further  violence,  amounted  to
    persecution  for  a  Convention  reason.  This  should  have  been  the
    Tribunal's starting point.


 8. The  grounds  as  advanced  before  me  are  that  these  matters  were
    implicitly accepted in the Respondent's  refusal  letter,  wherein  the
    writer has conducted a careful Karanakaran analysis of what matters are
    accepted, what is left in the balance, and what is rejected.    Nowhere
    are the beatings or threats rejected as non credible,  and  forming  as
    they do the backdrop to the acceptance that the Appellant  is  gay,  it
    appears that the Respondent takes no issue with  them.   Before  me  Ms
    Pettersen accepted that proposition, but  in  reality  it  matters  not
    whether the Respondent  accepted  this  history  or  not.  It  was  the
    evidence of the Appellant, and it was incumbent on the Tribunal to make
    findings on it.  No such findings are made.   That  was  of  course  an
    error. There can be no doubt that being beaten  with  electrical  wires
    because you are gay  amounts  to  persecution.  Whether  the  error  is
    material, however, depends largely on whether the  conclusions  on  the
    objective risk to gay men were sustainable.






    HJ (Iran): Objective Risk

 9. In HJ (Iran) and HT (Cameroon)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2010] UKSC 31 the Supreme Court gave guidance on how claims
    based on sexual orientation should be assessed.  At paragraph  82  Lord
    Rodger offers this structure for enquiry:

         82. When an applicant applies for asylum on the ground of  a  well-
         founded fear of persecution because he is gay,  the  tribunal  must
         first ask itself whether it is satisfied on the evidence that he is
         gay, or that he would be treated as gay by potential persecutors in
         his country of nationality.


         If so, the tribunal must then ask itself whether it is satisfied on
         the available evidence that gay people who lived  openly  would  be
         liable to persecution in the applicant's country of nationality.


         If so, the tribunal must go on  to  consider  what  the  individual
         applicant would do if he were returned  to  that  country.  If  the
         applicant would in fact live openly and thereby  be  exposed  to  a
         real risk of persecution,  then  he  has  a  well-founded  fear  of
         persecution  -  even  if  he  could  avoid  the  risk   by   living
         "discreetly".


         If, on the other hand, the tribunal concludes  that  the  applicant
         would in fact live discreetly and so avoid persecution, it must  go
         on to ask itself why he would do so. If the tribunal concludes that
         the applicant would choose to live discreetly simply  because  that
         was how he himself  would  wish  to  live,  or  because  of  social
         pressures,    eg, not wanting to distress his parents or  embarrass
         his friends,  then  his  application  should  be  rejected.  Social
         pressures of that  kind  do  not  amount  to  persecution  and  the
         Convention does not offer protection against them.  Such  a  person
         has no well-founded fear of persecution because, for  reasons  that
         have nothing to do with any fear of persecution, he himself chooses
         to adopt a way of life which means that he is not in fact liable to
         be persecuted because he  is  gay.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  the
         tribunal concludes that a material reason for the applicant  living
         discreetly on his return would be a fear of the  persecution  which
         would follow if he were to live openly as a gay  man,  then,  other
         things being equal, his application  should  be  accepted.  Such  a
         person has a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution.  To  reject  his
         application on the ground that he could avoid  the  persecution  by
         living discreetly would be to  defeat  the  very  right  which  the
         Convention exists to protect - his right to live freely and  openly
         as a gay man without fear  of  persecution.  By  admitting  him  to
         asylum and allowing him to live freely and  openly  as  a  gay  man
         without fear of persecution, the receiving state  gives  effect  to
         that  right  by  affording  the  applicant  a  surrogate  for   the
         protection from persecution which his country of nationality should
         have afforded him.


10. The first question was answered in the affirmative. It is accepted that
    the Appellant is gay.


11. The second question, answered negatively by both Respondent and  First-
    tier Tribunal, was whether a gay man who live openly in  Namibia  would
    be liable to persecution.

12. The First-tier Tribunal addresses this  question  at  its  �35-37.  The
    Tribunal finds that those engaging in gay sex are  not  prosecuted.  It
    finds that gay men do face discrimination generally. Neither  of  those
    findings are challenged. The Appellant's complaint is that the Tribunal
    goes from there to a conclusion that gay men do not  face  persecution,
    without any consideration of the extensive country background evidence,
    found primarily in the Respondent's CPIN, which indicates that gay  men
    do encounter high levels of violence  and  hostility  from  society  in
    general.

13. Before me Ms Pettersen accepted that none of this evidence is addressed
    in the decision. She further suggested that the real error lies in  the
    Tribunal's answer to the Lord Rodger's third and fourth questions in HJ
    (Iran). At its �38 the Tribunal states  that  the  Appellant  "has  not
    indicated in his evidence that he would behave in manner if returned to
    Namibia that would make it abundantly clear that he was a gay man", and
    at �39  the  risk  assessment  is  concluded  with  this:  "I  fail  to
    understand on the basis of the Appellant's evidence  how  he  would  or
    could be identified  as  a  homosexual  man".    Ms  Pettersen  rightly
    conceded that the first statement is wholly contrary to the Appellant's
    evidence, which states that he wishes to live openly as a gay  man;  he
    does so in this country, and it is accepted that to the extent that  he
    felt able, did so when he lived in Namibia.  I agree that the  Tribunal
    here misapprehended, or overlooked, the Appellant's  evidence  on  this
    key point. I am further troubled by the use of the term "abundantly"  -
    I am unsure what this gloss on the term "openly" might  mean.  All  the
    Tribunal had to ask itself was whether gay men  suffer  persecution  in
    Namibia, whether the Appellant would seek, to one extent or another, to
    hide his identity in that environment, and if so why.   The decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal is  flawed  for  its  failure  to  address  the
    country  background  evidence  to  which  it  was  referred,   in   its
    misapprehension of the Appellant's evidence and in its failure to adopt
    the structured approach endorsed by the Court of Appeal in HJ.


14. It follows that both grounds are made  out  and  the  decision  is  set
    aside.



    The Re-Made Decision

15. The parties before me agreed that since the central facts are accepted,
    there is no point in any further evidence being called. It  was  agreed
    that I would proceed to remake  the  decision  in  the  appeal  on  the
    evidence before me.


16. I begin by setting out  the  accepted  facts.  The  Appellant  is  from
    Okakarara, a small town in north  central  Namibia,  about  300km  from
    Windhoek.  The Appellant himself describes realising that he was gay in
    early puberty, but states that in retrospect his  peers  recognised  it
    before he did. He used to prefer to play with girls rather than do "boy
    things" and his brothers used  to  taunt  him  and  tell  him  to  play
    football instead. They would call him "moffy", a slang  term  for  gay.
    The Appellant's first homosexual  experience  was  when  he  was  about
    13/14.  His family found out that he had been with this other  boy  and
    his father beat him, almost killed him.  He hung him  upside  down  and
    beat him with electrical wires. He shouted that he was  going  to  make
    the Appellant "like girls". The Appellant's mother stopped the assault.
    Afterwards the Appellant assured his mother that he was not  gay  -  he
    said that him and the boy  had  just  been  playing.  His  family  were
    observant Christians who believed in the "holy fire".  As he grew older
    the Appellant began to understand what his feelings meant. When  people
    called him names he realised that there was nothing he could  do  about
    it because having homosexual relationships is not legal in Namibia.  He
    began to feel scared. He did not feel safe around his  family.  By  his
    late teens he was "trying to act like a  man"  in  order  to  hide  his
    sexuality.   He  started  playing  football  and  other   more   'male'
    activities.  He describes trying to "walk like a straight man".


17. The Appellant accepts that he did have male  partners  in  Namibia.  He
    describes having short flings or one night stands  -  "they  just  want
    intercourse and then they don't want to know. Some elderly men just  do
    that".   He describes being in bars and making eye contact - you  could
    follow each other into the toilet and exchange numbers and then arrange
    to meet somewhere. It would be somewhere dark, somewhere no  one  would
    find out. The Appellant would lie to his family when he  was  going  to
    such a rendezvous - he would say that he had a  job  interview,  or  an
    extra class. One time he met a man in a bar in Windhoek called the  Car
    Wash - it was known for being a gay bar.

18. The Appellant states that he only had one real relationship in Namibia.
    It was when he went to vocational school away from home,  when  he  was
    about 20.  He was staying with his  aunty  in  Kakaraya  and  attending
    college during the day.  He met a man, Dave, there.  They  met  in  the
    library and hit it off. They didn't need to discuss sexuality - it  was
    understood.  The Appellant really liked him and just took a risk:  "you
    just close your eyes and step into the fire".  They were  together  for
    about 2 years.   No one knew, except for the  Appellant's  sister,  who
    saw a picture of Dave on the Appellant's phone and questioned him about
    it. She kept it secret. They would not  go  anywhere  together  in  the
    'open', except they would study together in the  library.   They  would
    meet together at Dave's place, and on occasion the Appellant would rent
    a room where they could secretly meet.

19. The problems that caused the Appellant to leave Namibia started in late
    2018. Once you get past 21, and have done everything you  are  supposed
    to do, the tribe, your family, expect you to marry.   Sometime  in  the
    autumn one of the Appellant's uncles died. There is a tradition in  his
    tribe then when an elder dies, some younger people must marry. All  the
    elders had gathered for the funeral, and were in the 'big  house'  with
    the body of the dead man. They called the Appellant in - they were  all
    sitting there. They told him "tonight, you will marry".  His bride  was
    to be a cousin, who was one  year  younger  than  the  Appellant.   The
    Appellant left the big house, and "vanished". He knew that he could not
    marry his cousin: he walked out of the compound,  got  a  lift  to  the
    nearest  town,  and  then  took  another.  The  Appellant  returned  to
    Kakaraya, where he had been studying. He had one more test to  take  so
    he stayed there for a month or two to complete his  course.    Kakaraya
    is about 70km from the village.  The Appellant  was  contacted  by  his
    brother and sister they told him that everyone is angry and the  girl's
    family are asking "where is the boy". The Appellant  told  his  brother
    that he just wanted to finish his course and then he would marry.


20. He did not however return to the village  as  promised.  After  he  had
    finished his course  the  Appellant  went  to  Windhoek  to  stay  with
    friends.  He would not stay long in one place. His sister would message
    him to warn him that he had been located - that the family had heard he
    was staying with so-and-so and so he would move on.  He survived  doing
    odd electrical jobs and staying with friends.   After some  months  his
    sister told him that he should try and leave the  country  -  she  said
    that the family would "hound him like an  animal".  He  applied  for  a
    Schengen visa and left in approximately May 2019.

21. At his interview the Appellant said that he did not want to  remain  in
    hiding in Namibia: "I wouldn't want to live a life or  travelling  from
    town to town new life, sleep fearing, wake up fearing....Namibia is not
    such a big country, if someone is looking for you, they will find you".
      Asked directly whether he would hide his  sexuality  if  returned  to
    Namibia the Appellant said that he would. He is  still  afraid  of  his
    family, of people his age: "I am just fearing the whole country".

22. In this country the Appellant is entirely open about his sexuality.  He
    experiments with wearing make up, or high heels,  in public.  There  is
    no pressure here - no one cares. At  the  date  of  the  interview  the
    Appellant had made contact with a LGBT group in Liverpool - Many  Hands
    One Heart. He wanted to find a partner, to live a normal life. To marry
    another man.  Asked if it was important to him to be  able  to  express
    his sexuality the Appellant replied

         "Yes it is. It means like when I am around guys or ladies I  should
         be able to tell them I should be able to do that and not be  afraid
         of anything. People should know what I am"

23. I now apply these facts to the framework set out in HJ (Iran) [at my �9
    above].

24. The Appellant is a gay man.

25. As to whether gay men who live openly in Namibia face a  real  risk  of
    persecution, I have been referred to  the  Respondent's  CPIN  entitled
    Namibia: Sexual orientation and gender identity and expression (Version
    1.0:  November 2018) and  other  country  background  material  in  the
    Appellant's bundle, the relevant passages of which have been  helpfully
    highlighted.  Insofar as that additional material  is  consistent  with
    the CPIN, I have not summarised it in any detail here.

26. The Respondent points to positive features in the evidence  about  life
    for gay men in Namibia.  Although gay sex  is  illegal,  there  are  no
    reported prosecutions and the gay community, particularly in  Windhoek,
    appear to be  tolerated  by  the  state,  which  in  recent  years  has
    permitted 'Pride' parades  to  take  place  and  permitted  LGBT  civil
    society organisations to operate.    The US State  Department  reported
    that apart from isolated shouting of  insults  and  "head  shaking"  by
    passing drivers, the parades have passed off without incident. Although
    homosexuality has traditionally been considered taboo, a recent  survey
    found that 55% of Namibians would "accept a gay neighbour" and there is
    a growing tolerance for sexual minorities. Young people  in  particular
    believe old attitudes to be waning. The government of Namibia does  not
    generally  commit  "egregious  human  rights  violations"  against  the
    population and there is in general a good level  of  control  over  the
    police and security  forces.  Unlike  in  some  other  African  states,
    politicians do not universally incite hatred against the gay community:
    "vocal disapproval from  prominent  politicians,  parliamentarians  and
    some community members sits alongside attitudes ranging from  tolerance
    to acceptance in some communities" [CPIN 5.2.2].  It was  this  picture
    of relative tolerance which led the Respondent to refuse the claim.

27. Against this, are the following matters.

28. LGBTI people continue to report being subjected to  discrimination  and
    harassment when trying to access services,  in  interactions  with  the
    authorities, and by society in general.  Gay youth are more  likely  to
    be unemployed, to abuse drugs and alcohol,  and  to  be  vulnerable  to
    discrimination. There are  reports of LGBTI people being  subjected  to
    verbal, physical and sexual abuse. The CPIN cites [at  2.4.12]  a  2016
    academic study[2] which found that 52% of men who  have  sex  with  men
    (MSM) have experienced a human rights abuse, defined  as  rape,  police
    beatings, blackmail, or the  discriminatory  denial  of  healthcare  or
    housing. I note that a 2009 study conducted  by  the  UN  Human  Rights
    Committee made similar findings, as did a University of  Namibia  study
    in 2008. Mr Wood understandably placed considerable emphasis  on  these
    figures.   It is therefore necessary to look at this evidence  in  more
    detail.

29. It  is  clear  that  some  harassment  and  violence  stems  from  that
    proportion of the Namibian population who are not tolerant towards  the
    LGBTI community. This much is confirmed in the CPIN  [2.4.12].  At  one
    end of the scale examples are given of  the  discriminatory  denial  of
    medical care and housing, at the other  extreme  violence.  The  global
    figure of 52% in the 2016 study is broken down as follows:  "14% of the
    MSM Namibians surveyed had been raped, 21% had  been  blackmailed,  and
    22% had been  beaten  by  the  police  or  government  official"  [CPIN
    5.3.10]. These findings accord with the research conducted by The Other
    Foundation in 2017 which found:

         5.3.11 The Other Foundation report 2017 noted:


         'Violence against LGBTI people is pervasive  and  there  are  "high
         levels of sexual and other violence  targeting  people  because  of
         their sexual orientation and gender identity [which] are endemic in
         some areas of our country."  (ORN  Human  Rights  Report  on  LGBTI
         People in Namibia, 2013).


         'Upwards of 40% of MSM [men who have sex with men] experience human
         rights abuses including rape and violence,  and  this  violence  is
         reported as one of their main health  challenges.  Hatred,  extreme
         violence and rejection from family and communities, including  lack
         of financial support, is a significant challenge'

30. What is clear from the material in  the  CPIN  is  that  much  of  this
    violence is perpetrated by the police themselves. In 2016 the UN  ICCPR
    Human Rights Committee expressed concern about the  reported  cases  of
    violence and harassment against lesbian, gay, bisexual and  transgender
    persons by  the  police  [CPIN  4.2.3].   The  following  year  the  UN
    Committee Against Torture expressed concerns about the abuse  and  ill-
    treatment of LGBTI persons in detention and found that "police officers
    routinely violate the human rights of LGBT individuals  by  arbitrarily
    arresting them or subjecting them to  physical  violence"  [4.2.6]  (my
    emphasis).  The  Other  Foundation  made  similar  findings  in   2017,
    referencing a number of sources who conclude [at 4.2.4]:

         "The significant experiences and needs of LGBTI  people  relate  to
         the prevalence of physical and sexual violence,  including  general
         violence, police violence, rape and rape by the police.


         Harassment and brutality at the hands of the police  is  a  reality
         and police create methods  to  humiliate  trans  people,  including
         forcing them to strip in public"

31. Crucially, where hostility does occur, the Respondent recognises that a
    distinction must be drawn between  the  population  at  large,  who  in
    general terms enjoy a sufficiency of protection from the state, and the
    LGBTI community: "in general, the state appears able but  unwilling  to
    offer effective protection and the person will not  be  able  to  avail
    themselves of the protection of the authorities"  [CPIN  2.5.5].   This
    conclusion was, in light of the material  from  various  UN  committees
    cited in the CPIN, perhaps inescapable. UNCAT concluded that the  state
    had failed to  take  sufficient  action  to  prevent,  investigate  and
    protect LGBTI individuals from torture,  cruel,  inhuman  or  degrading
    punishment [see for instance 4.2.6] and found that this was,  at  least
    in part, because homosexuality continues to be forbidden by law. The US
    State Department has  in  recent  years  consistently  cited  the  same
    complaint made by human rights organisations. An example  is  given  in
    the CPIN [5.1.1] of what that means in practice, even in the context of
    relatively tolerant Windhoek:

         "That civilised and passive attitude doesn't always prevail, as one
         of my friends found out a few weeks ago when he was beaten up in  a
         gay friendly  local  establishment  in  a  homophobic  attack.  The
         establishment did nothing to try to protect him, which earned it an
         online petition, but little else.


         The police wont help, either. In fact, they reportedly  refused  to
         pursue the above case and are often the cause of  violence  against
         the LGBTI community. The biggest problem is the silence that breeds
         the ignorance that breeds the violence".

32. That failure of state protection must be seen in  the  context  of  the
    continued existence of laws prohibiting homosexual intercourse. A  2013
    report Baseline Study Report on Human Rights in Namibia to this  effect
    is cited in the CPIN:

         5.3.2 The same report noted: 'Even though the laws  on  sodomy  and
         unnatural sexual offences are seldom enforced, their existence  has
         a negative impact on the  LGBT  community.  These  laws  perpetuate
         stigma and discrimination, create an environment of fear, encourage
         secrecy which undermines public health initiatives and  damage  the
         dignity of LGBT individuals'.


33. The conclusion I draw from this material is as follows. The  Respondent
    is correct to find that Namibia is a significantly better place  to  be
    gay than some other countries in  Africa.  That  the  authorities,  and
    society in general, has given space to, and tolerated 'Pride'  marches,
    is a very positive sign.  Although  homosexual  intercourse  remains  a
    crime, there appears to be  no  appetite  for  prosecutions.  Gay  bars
    exist, particularly in Windhoek. The situation  is  improving  all  the
    time, as the views of the younger population become ever more tolerant,
    and LGBTI representation in civil society increases in  strength.   The
    author of the refusal letter has however fallen into the  trap  -  much
    like the First-tier Tribunal - of concluding that a  LBGT  presence  in
    civil society, and a lack of prosecutions, must mean that there is  not
    in general terms a real risk of serious harm for those  who  choose  to
    live 'openly'.  I am not satisfied that the enquiry can properly  begin
    and end there.  The fact that a particular social group  exists  cannot
    logically negate its claim to face persecution; the fact  that  such  a
    group is permitted to  organise  or  campaign  collectively  may  be  a
    relevant factor in determining whether its members are at risk, but  it
    cannot be the only consideration.


34. Here, unfortunately, the  evidence  on  the  other  side  is  currently
    outweighing those positive advances in human  rights  in  Namibia.  The
    bald statistics which appear in the CPIN have not been  challenged  and
    are not contradicted by  any  other  material  before  me.    They  are
    broadly consistent with studies over the preceding decade conducted  by
    the UN CRC and other academics. The 2016  research found  that  14%  of
    gay men in Namibia have been raped, and 22% have  experienced  violence
    at the hands of the police. 21%  report  being  subject  to  blackmail.
    Those are not insignificant figures, nor insignificant harms  that  can
    be dismissed as 'discrimination'. They must be read  in  light  of  the
    conclusions that violence towards  the  LGBTI  community  generally  is
    "pervasive" and at "high levels" (The Other Foundation  2017).  Violent
    assault by the police is  "routine"  (UN  CAT).   I  do  not  think  it
    impermissible speculation to find that those who are subject  to  these
    most serious of human rights violations are likely  to  those  who  are
    identified by the perpetrators as being LGBTI.  It  follows  that  they
    are likely to be, to one extent or another, 'open' in their  sexuality.
    That being the case, I must find that for  those  brave  enough  to  be
    'out' in Namibia, life in this relatively tolerant, "laid back" country
    nevertheless carries with it the constant risk of serious harm.     The
    fact that there are gay  bars  is  little  consolation  if  daily  life
    carries a 1 in 5 chance of being assaulted  by  the  police,  raped  or
    blackmailed.

35. It is clear from the  Appellant's  own  evidence  that  he  -  and  the
    community at large - apprehended that to be the case.  His  description
    of his own illicit encounters with men in toilets, and how he  and  his
    partner Dave managed to maintain a relationship over two years entirely
    in secret is consistent with this country background  material.  Whilst
    the direct threat to the Appellant came from his family,  he  indicates
    in his evidence that he "feared the whole country". That the  Appellant
    himself did not experience at direct assault by for instance the police
    is, on a statistical analysis, his good fortune. I note in this  regard
    that he was only in Windhoek a matter of  months  before  he  left  the
    country.

36. I am satisfied that whilst is clearly a  mixed  picture  for  the  LGBT
    community in Namibia, it remains the case that such individuals face  a
    real risk of persecution if they choose to live openly.

37. I return to the HJ analysis.   Given the unchallenged evidence  of  the
    Appellant, on this I can be brief. It is his clear evidence that whilst
    in Namibia he hid his sexuality not just  from  his  family,  but  from
    society at large. To the extent that he was able to have sex with other
    men he did so in secret, and at significant personal  risk.  He  "slept
    fearing, woke fearing".    In this country, absent the risk of  serious
    physical harm the  Appellant  is  able  to  openly  express  his  LGBTI
    identity.  He has experimented by wearing make-up  and  high  heels  in
    public; he speaks of his hope of finding a partner, and maybe  one  day
    getting married.  He is able to live this life not just because  he  is
    free of the constraints of societal expectation, but because he is free
    of a risk of actual harm. I accept his evidence  that  if  returned  to
    Namibia he would feel compelled to go back into hiding, and he would do
    so out of fear of persecution.

38. It follows that the Appellant is a refugee.


    Anonymity Order

39. This appeal concerns a claim for protection.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decision and Directions


40. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is flawed for material error of
    law and it is set aside.


41. The decision in the appeal is remade as follows: the appeal is  allowed
    on protection grounds.

42. There is an order for anonymity.
