                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge I Malcolm, promulgated on 2nd June 2017, following a  hearing  at
    Hatton Cross  on  8th  May  2017.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the   Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Bangladesh, and was born  on  4th
    January 1980.  He appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated
    13th August 2015, refusing his application for further leave to  remain
    in the UK as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant.  The reason given was that the
    Appellant had  submitted  a  false  statement.   This  is  because  the
    certificate of sponsorship issued  by  Hawm  Consultants,  when  cross-
    checked on their systems, did not appear, as  stated.   Since  a  false
    statement had been submitted it stood to  be  refused  under  paragraph
    322(1A) of the Immigration Rules.  Any future  applications  for  entry
    clearance or leave  to  enter  the  UK  would  also  be  refused  under
    paragraph 320(7B) of the Immigration Rules.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim was that, having arrived in the UK in  July  2009
    as a Tier 4 Student, he subsequently engaged I Core Agency to get him a
    sponsorship letter, which materialised after his  interview  with  Hawm
    Consultants, arranged  by  the  recruitment  agency  of  I  Core.   The
    Appellant's claim now is that  he  was  defrauded  by  the  recruitment
    agency in whom he had placed his trust and had no knowledge  whatsoever
    that there was anything wrong with the document with which he had  been
    issued.  He also places reliance upon his private life in the UK  since
    he had been in this country genuinely  pursuing  his  studies  and  had
    lived here for over seven years.  Furthermore, he confirmed that he had
    paid I Core Agency ï¿½500 at a meeting  which  he  had  with  them.   The
    letter from Hawm Consultants Limited dated 14th August 2014 was  given
    to him at the recruitment agency's office by I Core.  The crux  of  the
    Appellant's claim is that, having discovered that  the  certificate  of
    sponsorship that he had been handed by I Core was fraudulent, he sought
    to amend his application before the Home Office, before the Home Office
    could make its decision.  Accordingly, he could not be said  guilty  of
    fraudulent activity and could not be said to have benefited from it.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge held that "false representations have been made.  I find that
    these were made without  the  Appellant's  knowledge"  (paragraph  81).
    With respect to the Appellant's claim that he had amended his  original
    application, which was not tainted by any fraud, the  judge  held  that
    "the decision which has  been  made  is  a  decision  on  the  original
    application as subsequently varied  by  application  of  the  Appellant
    (initially to  a  Tier  4  application  and  thereafter  to  a  Tier  2
    application)" (paragraph 91).  Significantly, the  judge  stated  that,



         "I do not accept the argument that in seeking to vary the  original
         application (from Tier 2 to Tier 4 that documentation submitted  in
         the original application should simply be disregarded (in a similar
         manner as if the application had been withdrawn).   The  facts  are
         that the application was not withdrawn  and  therefore  I  consider
         that any documentation provided in the initial application is still
         able to be considered (albeit I accept that the COS  would  not  be
         relevant to a Tier 4 application)" (paragraph 92).

 5. Finally, the judge went on to give  consideration  to  the  Appellant's
    Article 8 claims and held that, "in considering  the  Appellant's  case
    outside the Rules I accept that the Appellant has private life ties  in
    the UK having lived  here  since  2009  and  that  removing  him  would
    interfere with private life" (paragraph 108).  Nevertheless,  this  did
    not amount to an unjustified interference  with  the  exercise  of  the
    Appellant's right to respect for private life (paragraph 109).

 6. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 7. The grounds of application state that the judge's approach to Article 8
    was flawed because the central issue was whether or not  the  Appellant
    was the victim of a deception, or had sought to practise deception upon
    the  Respondent.   Since  the  judge  appears  to  have  accepted   (at
    paragraphs 78 and 81) that the Appellant  was  an  innocent  victim  of
    fraud, it could not be in the public interest to reject his claim.

 8. On 30th June 2017, permission to appeal was granted by the Tribunal.

 9. On 13th July 2017, a Rule 24 response was entered by the  Secretary  of
    State placing reliance upon Patel  [2013]  UKSC  72  which  states  (at
    paragraph 57) that "Article 8 is not a general  dispensing  power"  and
    that "the opportunity for a promising student to complete his course in
    this country, however desirable in general terms, is not  in  itself  a
    right protected under Article 8".

Submissions

10. At the hearing before me on 18th August 2017, Mr  Walsh,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Appellant made the  following  submissions.   First,  the
    judge had directed himself to the "relevant law" (see paragraph 71) and
    then determined the matter under paragraph 322(1A) of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  He had not made a decision under paragraph 320(7)(b), which  he
    was required to.

11. Second, the judge did make a decision under Article  8,  ECHR  but  has
    erred in the manner of his doing  so.   Relevant  to  both  issues,  he
    submitted, was the background to the case.  This was an  Appellant  who
    came to the UK in 2009 and had moved from the status of  a  student  to
    that of a post-study work.  In August 2014 he applied to  remain  as  a
    Tier 2 (General) Migrant.  It is  agreed  by  all  concerned  that  the
    application contained a representation that was incorrect  because  the
    COS was false.  The point is, however, that the  Appellant  found  this
    out himself before the Secretary of State could make a decision on  his
    application, and within a week changed his application  to  that  of  a
    Tier 4 Migrant.  In December 2014 the Appellant varied the  application
    again to a Tier 2 application, but it is a different COS that  he  then
    relied  upon.   The  two  later  ones   did   not   contain   a   false
    representation.

12. This means that the refusal letter (at  page  20  of  the  Respondent's
    bundle) ends with the sentence that, "as a  false  statement  has  been
    made ... ..." (see page 2 of 5 of the refusal letter) that  any  future
    applications  will  be  "refused  under  paragraph  322(1A),   of   the
    Immigration Rules".

13. Mr Walsh submitted that it is well-known that an  existing  application
    can be varied so long as the Secretary of State has not made a decision
    on it.  The Appellant found out because he went  to  his  employer  who
    told him that they had not issued  him  with  a  COS.   He  then  acted
    promptly on that information.

14. The judge's conclusions (at paragraph 81) were  that,  "I  accept  that
    false representations had been made.   I  find  that  these  were  made
    without the Appellant's knowledge".  However,  the  error  lay  in  the
    judge's statement at paragraph  91  where  he  went  on  to  say  that,



         "Accordingly having given consideration to the terms of Section  3C
         of the Immigration Act 1971 I find that the decision which has been
         made is a decision on  the  original  application  as  subsequently
         varied by application of the  Appellant  (initially  to  a  Tier  4
         application and thereafter to a Tier 2 application)".

15. Mr Walsh submitted that, the fact was that this was such a  substantial
    variation of the application that,  notwithstanding  it  had  not  been
    withdrawn  as  such,  it  could  not  be  treated  as   "the   original
    application".  The decision now being made was on a Tier 2 application,
    whereas the original application was a Tier 4 application, and it was a
    substantial change of application.

16. If the Appellant had  formally  withdrawn  the  application,  and  then
    submitted a new one, there was no way that the Secretary of State would
    have said that this was a false application.  Given that the  Appellant
    was entitled to vary his application before a decision, it was wrong to
    reject this on the basis that it was a false application.

17. With respect to Article 8, the judge states that  the  Appellant  could
    not qualify under paragraph 276ADE,  even  though  "the  Appellant  has
    private life ties  in  the  UK  having  lived  here  since  2009"  (see
    paragraph 108).  The judge's conclusions (at paragraph 110), that there
    were no good arguable grounds or exceptional circumstances to allow the
    appeal under Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules, was unsustainable
    in itself because it is  too  brief  a  conclusion,  with  no  adequate
    reasons being given for why  the  judge  came  to  this  conclusion  on
    Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.

18. For his part, Mr Tufan, appearing on behalf of the Respondent Secretary
    of State, submitted that he would rely on his Rule 24 response  as  far
    as the decision of the judge on Article 8 grounds was  concerned.   The
    Rule 24 response refers to paragraph 57 of Patel [2013] UKSC 72,  which
    is to the effect that, "Article 8 is not a  general  dispensing  power"
    and "the opportunity for a promising student to complete his course  in
    this country is  not  in  itself  a  right  protected  by  Article  8".
    Furthermore, we now had the decision of the Supreme  Court  in  Agyarko
    [2017] UKSC 11, which confirmed that "unjustifiably harsh consequences"
    has a high threshold and is a requirement to be met in such cases.

19. With respect to the application of Section 322(1A) the  judge  referred
    to this (at paragraph 71) and referred  to  the  stipulation  there  of
    "whether  or  not  to  the  applicant's   knowledge"   when   a   false
    representation application was being  considered.   In  general  terms,
    submitted Mr Tufan, the judge had found in favour of the Appellant.  He
    had said (at paragraph 81) that the Appellant had no knowledge  of  the
    misrepresentation.  Nevertheless, the fact remains that  the  provision
    is to the effect "whether or not to the applicant's knowledge" and this
    must be given its full effect.

20. Having said that, submitted Mr Tufan, he would have to accept that  the
    judge had not referred to Section 320(7B), but that is to do  with  the
    position in the future, whereby application will  be  rejected  on  the
    basis of past misrepresentation.

21. With respect to Section 3C of the 1971 Act, reliance was placed  by  Mr
    Tufan on JH (Zimbabwe) [2009] EWCA Civ 78,  which  established  that  a
    person cannot  make  a  new  application  "by  implication"  which  the
    Appellant had purported to do here.  He could only  vary  the  original
    application.  The Appellant did not ever inform the Secretary of  State
    that he had got his COS wrong and wished to rectify that.

22. Finally, the  suggestion  that  if  the  Appellant  had  withdrawn  the
    application he would have been spared the application of the provisions
    was misconceived because paragraph 322(2) was  in  terms  that,  "where
    false representations have been made or false documents or  information
    have been submitted (whether or not material to  the  application,  and
    whether or not to the applicant's knowledge), ..." (paragraph  322(1A).
    Paragraph 322(2) referred to the making of a false  application.   That
    was enough, submitted Mr Tufan, to disqualify the Appellant.

23. In reply, Mr Walsh submitted that, firstly, in relation to  Article  8,
    ECHR, the reliance upon Patel [2013] UKSC 72, was misconceived  because
    that was a very different case.  Unlike in that case,  the  judge  here
    had found the Appellant to have private life ties in the UK  (paragraph
    108) and had found Article 8 to have been engaged (paragraph 109), only
    then to go on to conclude (at paragraph 110) that there were  no  "good
    arguable grounds or exceptional circumstances", but without  explaining
    why.  Second, the  reliance  on  paragraph  35  of  JH  (Zimbabwe)  was
    misleading,  with  respect  to  the  Appellant's   variation   of   his
    application, because three lines from the  bottom  of  that  paragraph,
    Lord Justice Richards makes it clear that,

         "It is possible to vary the one permitted application.   If  it  is
         varied, any decision (and any further appeal) will  relate  to  the
         application as varied.  But once  a  decision  has  been  made,  no
         variation to the application is possible  since  there  is  nothing
         left to vary" (paragraph 35).





Decision

24. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that  I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

25. First, this was a case where the Appellant  had  Section  3C  leave  to
    remain under the Immigration Act 1971.  In JH (Zimbabwe) the  Court  of
    Appeal considered "how Section 3C operates"  (at  paragraph  35).   The
    court went on  to  say  that,  "during  the  period  of  the  statutory
    extension of the original leave, no further application  for  variation
    of that leave can be made".  It went on to say that "there can be  only
    one application for variation of the original leave, and there  can  be
    only one decision (and, where applicable, one appeal).".  It ended with
    the observation that,  "it  is  possible  to  vary  the  one  permitted
    application" and once it is varied,  "any  decision  (and  any  further
    appeal) will relate to the application as varied" (paragraph  35).   In
    the instant case, the  Appellant  did  vary  the  application  and  the
    decision should have related to the application as varied.

26. As Mr Walsh submitted, the  last  two  variations  did  not  contain  a
    misrepresentation.  It was open to the  Appellant,  who  had  not  been
    guilty of any false misrepresentation himself, to set  out  to  correct
    this, provided he did so timeously, and  before  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State was made.  This was the case here.  Accordingly, his
    Section 3C leave survived and he was not culpable on account of  making
    false representations.

27. Second, insofar as Article 8 is concerned, this is  a  case  where  the
    judge does accept that the Appellant had a private life in the UK since
    2009  "and  that  removing  him  would  interfere  with  private  life"
    (paragraph 108).  He did go on to consider whether  the  removal  would
    "be an unjustified  interference"  with  that  right  (paragraph  109).
    Thereafter,  however,  the  judge's  determination  of  this  issue  is
    formulaic.  There is a reference to there being an absence of "any good
    arguable grounds or exceptional  circumstances  to  allow  the  appeal"
    (paragraph 110).  But there is no reasoning to uphold that  conclusion.
    In  circumstances,  where  the  judge  had  already  found   that   the
    Appellant's private life was engaged, it  was  incumbent  upon  him  to
    explain through reasons why there were no exceptional circumstances and
    no arguable  grounds  such  that  it  would  indeed  be  a  justifiable
    interference with his rights when it came to the Secretary  of  State's
    removal decision.

28. In the circumstances, I am remaking this decision by remitting it  back
    to the First-tier Tribunal, to be determined  by  a  judge  other  than
    Judge Sweet under practice statement 7.2 so that proper findings can be
    made with respect to the Appellant's Article 8 claim, together with the
    decision as to the Appellant's application under Tier 2.

Notice of Decision

29. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error of law such that it falls to be  set  aside.   I
    set aside the decision of the original judge.  I remake  this  decision
    by  remitting  it  back  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  under  practice
    statement 7.2 to be heard by a judge other than Judge Sweet.

30. No anonymity direction is made.

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Juss                 19th September 2017
