                                   Between

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

                      MISS SHEILA MARIE ANTONIO VALDEZ
                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss K Mustapha, Kemi Law Chambers


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The respondent is a citizen of the Philippines and her  date  of  birth
    is 6 April 1973.  I will refer to the respondent as  the  appellant  as
    she was before the First-tier Tribunal.

2.   The appellant made an application for a residence card as an  unmarried
    partner  pursuant  to  the   Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
    Regulations 2006 on the basis that she is an  extended  family  member.
    The application was refused by the Secretary of State in a decision  of
    2 January 2014.because  it  was  not  accepted  that  the  relationship
    between the appellant and  the  EEA  national,  Ciaron  Phelan,  was  a
    durable relationship.

3.   The appellant appealed against the decision and the appeal was  allowed
    by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Fletcher Hill in  a  decision  that
    was promulgated on 7 October 2014 following a hearing on  10  September
    2014.  The First-tier Tribunal heard evidence from  the  appellant  and
    the sponsor.  The judge found both credible and that  the  relationship
    was durable. She went onto allow the appeal under the 2006 Regulations.



4.   The grounds seeking permission argue that the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal is not in accordance with Regulation 17(4)  of  the  2006
    Regulations. Whether a residence card is granted is at  the  discretion
    of the Secretary of State and the judge should have found the  decision
    as otherwise not in accordance with the law because discretion had  not
    been exercised. It was not open to the judge to allow it under the 2006
    Regulations.

5.   Permission to appeal was granted by Judge McDade on 27  November  2014.
    Thus the matter came before me.

6.   The appellant submitted a response pursuant to  Rule  24  of  the  2008
    Procedure Rules wherein it is conceded that the judge made  a  material
    error of law for the reasons identified in the  grounds  and  that  the
    decision should be set aside and allowed on the basis that it is not in
    accordance with the law only.

7.   The judge  made  an  error  of  law  and  the  decision  misunderstands
    regulation 17(4)  (see  Moneke  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2011] UKUT 00341 (IAC)).  I set aside the decision pursuant
    to Section 12(2) (a) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act  2007
    and I remake the decision under Section 12(2) (b)(ii) of the 2007 Act.

8.   The  judge  made  a  lawful  and  sustainable  finding  (which  is  not
    challenged in the grounds) that the appellant qualifies as an  extended
    family member. I allow the appeal to the extent that  the  decision  is
    not in accordance with the  law  pursuant  to  Section  86(3A)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.  The  application  is
    outstanding pending a lawful decision.

No anonymity direction is made.
