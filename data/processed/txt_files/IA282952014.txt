Representation:
For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr Tarlow (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISIONS AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of India. The appellant entered  the  United
    Kingdom on April 11, 2009 as a work permit holder  until  February  24,
    2014. On February 22, 2014 he applied for indefinite leave to remain as
    a work permit holder. The respondent refused the  application  on  June
    18, 2014 and gave directions for his removal pursuant to section 47  of
    the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. This application  was
    refused because he failed to satisfy the requirements of paragraph  134
    HC 395 and in particular because he failed  to  provide  the  specified
    documents  required  in  paragraph  134-SD  HC  395  to  evidence   the
    employer's certification in sub-section (iv) and  the  reason  for  the
    absences set out in paragraph 128A HC 395.

 2.  The  appellant  appealed  under  section  82(1)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on July 7, 2014  and  the  matter  came
    before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Dickson  (hereinafter  referred
    to as the "FtTJ") on October 1, 2014 and in a decision  promulgated  on
    October 14, 2014 he allowed the  appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules
    finding:

          a. Although the appellant had not received the wages the employer
             had agreed to pay him �21,000 from December 1, 2013 and it was
             unfortunate that between December 2013 and June 2014 he was at
             the old rate thus creating an underpayment.

          b. The appellant  received  benefits  in  kind  totalling  �7,000
             relating to accommodation and other expenses such as heating.

          c. The appellant had an income of �28,000 since December 1, 2013.



          d. The appellant produced a letter from his  employer  explaining
             his absences as required by paragraph 134-SD HC 395.

 3. The respondent lodged grounds  of  appeal  on  October  23,  2014.  She
    submitted the FtTJ erred  by  simply  accepting  the  appellant's  oral
    evidence that salary increase was agreed as  evidence  that  the  Rules
    were met. Whilst the FtTJ relied on the Tribunal decision of  Philipson
    (ILR-not PBS; evidence) India [2012] UKUT 00039 the appellant  had  not
    demonstrated any salary increase as no additional wages had been paid.

 4. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal McDade granted permission to appeal on
    December 2, 2014 stating there was an arguable error in  law  based  on
    the grounds and the matter came before me on January 23, 2015.

 5. I found there was an error in law because the FtTJ allowed  the  appeal
    on case law that pre-dated the introduction of the paragraph 134-SD  HC
    395 and the FtTJ should have considered the application in light of the
    Rules as they applied to what documents had to be submitted.  The  FtTJ
    had stated at paragraph [24] of his determination  that  the  appellant
    had provided the specified documents but it was common  ground  at  the
    hearing before me that the documents required by paragraph 134-SD  were
    still  outstanding  in  so  far  as  they  related  to  the   financial
    requirements. That Rule specifies what must be  provided  to  meet  the
    Rules. The appellant did not  provide  the  necessary  requirement  and
    consequently by allowing the appeal based solely on oral  evidence  the
    FtTJ erred in law.

 6. Mr Yeo, who represented the appellant at  that  hearing,  asked  me  to
    adjourn the case to enable further submissions and  in  particular  for
    consideration as to whether the appellant had an  expectation  that  he
    would have been granted indefinite leave to remain  as  a  work  permit
    holder and should be allowed to stay under article 8 ECHR.

 7. Having found the error of law I adjourned the matter to  the  date  set
    out above and gave my reasons for the error of law and  the  future  of
    conduct of these proceedings in a written determination.

 8. At today's hearing neither the appellant nor his  representatives  were
    in attendance. Calls were made on  two  occasions  to  the  appellant's
    representatives  and  messages   left   on   an   answer   phone.   The
    representatives did not return the call prior to calling the case on at
    11am-the hearing was listed for 10am. I should also add  that  no  call
    had been returned by the lunch break at 1pm.

 9. A notice of hearing had been correctly sent to both the  appellant  and
    his representatives on February 10,  2015  by  first  class  post.  The
    notices have not been returned and I am satisfied  both  the  appellant
    and his representatives have knowledge of the hearing.

10. Mr Tarlow  invited  me  to  deal  with  the  case  and  I  invited  his
    submissions.

11. Mr Tarlow submitted the appellant had still not demonstrated compliance
    with the Rules and had adduced no evidence to  support  his  article  8
    claim. He came here as a work  permit  holder  and  whilst  he  had  an
    expectation of being allowed to remain at the  end  of  five  years  he
    would only have had that expectation if he met the  Immigration  Rules.
    His private life was work based only and even if article 8 was  engaged
    it was not disproportionate to require him to leave the country.

    FINDINGS

12. Since the matter last came before me nothing has happened save the case
    was listed for a hearing on today's date. I had  issued  directions  on
    January 29, 2015 that were sent to the parties, including the appellant
    and his representatives, the same day. This provided for any additional
    evidence to be served by February 20, 2015.  No  further  evidence  was
    served.

13. With regard to the application under the Immigration Rules I  find,  in
    the absence of any further evidence or explanation, that the  appellant
    has not complied with the requirements of paragraph 134-SD HC 395.  The
    reasons I gave in my decision of January 23, 2015 still apply  and  the
    failure to provide financial evidence to demonstrate the Rules are  met
    means I must dismiss the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

14. The appellant has failed to  demonstrate  he  would  satisfy  paragraph
    276ADE HC 395. There  is  also  no  claim  under  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

15. As regards any article 8 claim I acknowledge the appellant came to  the
    United Kingdom in April 2009. Since that date he has worked as  a  work
    permit holder in a private school. His statement dated October 1,  2014
    makes no reference to any other private life.  There  is  no  claim  of
    family life.

16. Lord Bingham laid down the test to be applied  in  Razgar  [2004]  UKHL
    00027. The fact the appellant has worked for over  five  years  in  the
    United Kingdom  suggests  that  he  may  have  some  private  life  but
    following the decision of Nasim and  others  (Article  8)  [2014]  UKUT
    00025 (IAC) the Tribunal made clear in paragraphs [20] to [21]  of  the
    need to re-focus attention on the nature and purpose of Article 8.

17. I accept a period of work  can  amount  to  private  life  and  if  the
    appellant were removed then his ability to undertake this work would be
    interfered with. However, that interference is in accordance  with  the
    law because the appellant has failed to satisfy the requirements of the
    Immigration Rules (Paragraph 134 HC 395) and removal  would  be  for  a
    reason set out in article 8(2) ECHR.

18. The appellant has lived the majority of  his  life  in  India.  He  has
    family living there and when his mother was ill he  returned  to  India
    for short periods. Section 117B of the 2002 Act applies and sub-section
    (1) makes clear that the maintenance of effective  immigration  control
    is in the public interest. Concerns  were  raised  in  the  substantive
    application over his level of salary on the basis that he had failed to
    produce evidence that demonstrated  he  met  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules. The fact he was unable to produce suitable  evidence
    of this raises  questions  about  his  ability  to  show  he  would  be
    financially independent. Non-compliance  with  the  Rules  is  a  major
    factor to be considered when assessing a claim under article  8.  I  am
    satisfied that removing the appellant would not be disproportionate.

    DECISION

19. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did disclose an error in law. I
    set aside the  decision  and  I  dismiss  the  appeal  under  both  the
    Immigration Rules and article 8 ECHR.

20. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction pursuant to
    Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and I see
    no reason to alter that order.
