                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan whose  application  for  further
    leave to remain as a Tier  4  (General)  Student  was  refused  by  the
    Respondent on  the  30th  September  2013.   His  appeal  against  that
    decision was allowed on human rights grounds by Judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal Hague on the 15th May 2014.

 2. The Respondent's representative applied for permission to appeal on the
    grounds that the First-tier Judge erred  in  law  in  his  approach  to
    Article 8.  Permission to appeal was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Nicholson on the 25th June 2014.  Thus the matter came before  me
    in the Upper Tribunal on the 3rd September 2014.  Neither the Appellant
    nor his representative attended the hearing.  There  was  before  me  a
    letter from the Appellant's representatives, Rana & Co Solicitors dated
    the 2nd September 2014.  The letter states as follows:

         "We have made attempts to contact our client  in  respect  of  this
         hearing  but  to  no  avail.   Given  this  we  are   without   any
         instructions and cease to act for the Appellant in this matter".

 3. There was no explanation for the  Appellant's  failure  to  attend  the
    hearing in person and there was no application for an  adjournment.   I
    was satisfied from the Tribunal file that notice of  hearing  had  been
    sent to the Appellant at the correct address on the 15th July  2014  by
    First Class Post.  In the circumstances, I concluded, in my discretion,
    that it was appropriate to determine  the  appeal  in  the  Appellant's
    absence.

 4. The Appellant's application was made under the Points Based System.  He
    claimed ten points for maintenance but  was  awarded  no  points.   The
    Appellant was required to show that  he  had  ï¿½3,550  available  for  a
    consecutive period of twenty-eight days.  He  submitted  his  own  bank
    statements which showed a balance falling substantially short  of  what
    was required.  He also submitted a bank statement from his  father  but
    that was not taken into account by the Respondent because the Appellant
    had failed to provide his birth certificate  showing  his  relationship
    with his father as required by Appendix C.

 5. The First-tier Judge records that, in his oral evidence, the  Appellant
    said that he had produced an affidavit from his father  confirming  his
    sponsorship and the relationship between them.  He  claimed  that  this
    had been sufficient when he made his earlier applications.  By the time
    of the appeal hearing he had submitted his birth certificate confirming
    the relationship but his representative  acknowledged  that  the  birth
    certificate was inadmissible.  It was argued on behalf of the Appellant
    that he had established a private life in the course of his  study  and
    reliance was placed on the decision in CDS (Brazil).

 6. The First-tier Judge accepted from the evidence  before  him  that  the
    Appellant was studying on a course that was "amply funded" and that  in
    consequence he has a  private  life  in  the  United  Kingdom.   As  he
    satisfied the substance of the requirements of the Rules and  had  only
    fallen down on what the Judge refers to as "the  technical  rules"  the
    Judge was satisfied that the public interest in enforcing the  decision
    against  the  decision  was  small.   The  decision   was,   therefore,
    disproportionate.

 7. In submissions, Miss Johnstone relied upon the grounds  in  support  of
    the application for permission to appeal.  The grounds referred  to  MF
    (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 where the Court of Appeal confirmed that
    the Immigration Rules are a complete code that form the starting  point
    for the decision maker.  Any Article 8 assessment should only  be  made
    after consideration under the Rules.  That was not done in the  instant
    case.  It is submitted that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law by not
    having regard to the Rules  and  that  the  subsequent  proportionality
    assessment was thereby unsustainable.

 8. Reference is further made to the guidance given by the  Upper  Tribunal
    in Gulshan  [2013]  UKUT  00640  to  the  effect  that  the  Article  8
    assessment shall  only  be  carried  out  where  there  are  compelling
    circumstances not recognised by the Rules.  In this case the First-tier
    Tribunal  did  not  identify  such  compelling  circumstances  and  its
    findings are therefore unsustainable.

 9. The grounds further argue that it was made clear  in  Gulshan  that  at
    this stage an appeal should only be allowed where there are exceptional
    circumstances.  The decision in Nagre [2013] EWHC  720  Admin  endorsed
    the Respondent's guidance on the meaning of exceptional  circumstances,
    namely ones where refusal would lead to an unjustifiably harsh outcome.



10. In conclusion, the grounds argue that the First-tier Tribunal failed to
    provide adequate reasons why the Appellant's circumstances were  either
    compelling or exceptional.  There was no reason why the Appellant could
    not continue his private life in Pakistan.

11. In her oral submission, Miss Johnstone also referred to Paragraph 7  of
    the  determination  where  the  Judge  had,  in  effect,  treated   the
    Appellant's situation as a "near miss".  Miss Johnstone submitted  that
    such an approach was inappropriate and wrong in law.

12. I note that in his grant  of  permission  to  appeal,  Judge  Nicholson
    pointed out that there was no dispute that the Appellant could not meet
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  He had  insufficient  funds
    in his own account to meet the maintenance requirements and although he
    relied on funds in his father's account he had not submitted his  birth
    certificate as required by the Immigration Rules.  By the date  of  the
    hearing,  the  Appellant  had  submitted  the  birth  certificate   (as
    mentioned above) but that did not help him so far  as  the  Immigration
    Rules were concerned because it was a requirement that the  certificate
    be submitted with the application.  Nevertheless, the First-tier  Judge
    had allowed the appeal under Article 8, relying on the decision in  CDS
    (Brazil).


13. Judge Nicholson considered it arguable that the First-tier Judge should
    have followed the approach in Gulshan and that he erred in  considering
    that CDS (Brazil) applied without identifying compelling or exceptional
    circumstances.  In CDS (Brazil) the Upper Tribunal acknowledged that:

         "People who had been admitted on a course of study ...  are  likely
         to build up a relevant connection with the course, the institution,
         an educational sequence for the ultimate professional qualification
         sought, as  well  as  social  ties  during  the  period  of  study.
         Cumulatively  this  may  amount  to  private  life  that   deserves
         respect".


    In this case,  however,  the  Appellant  only  started  attending  City
    College a few days before his application was refused.  He built up his
    connection to the course at a time  when  his  rights  to  do  so  were
    precarious.  Nor did the Judge refer to social ties which were a factor
    identified in CDS (Brazil).  Secondly,  in  Patel  and  Others  v  SSHD
    [2013] UKSC 72 the Supreme Court rejected an argument that, if it could
    be shown that an applicant could have met the substantive  requirements
    of the Rules, the failure to do so should be regarded as purely formal.
     Reference is made to the opinion of Lord Carnworth who said:

         "Such considerations do not by themselves provide grounds of appeal
         under Article 8, which is concerned with private  or  family  life,
         not education as such.  The opportunity for a promising student  to
         complete his course in this country, however desirable  in  general
         terms, is not in itself a right protected under Article 8".

    I would add that His Lordship also made  reference  to  the  fact  that
    Article 8 should not be regarded as a general dispensing provision.

14. For the reasons given above,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  approach  to
    Article 8 adopted by the First-tier Judge was fundamentally flawed  and
    amounts to a material error of law.  The determination falls to be  set
    aside.

15. As already mentioned,  the  Appellant  failed  without  explanation  to
    attend the hearing before the Upper Tribunal.  It is apparent  that  he
    has failed to respond to attempts on the part of his representatives to
    contact him.  His unexplained absence suggests a lack  of  interest  in
    pursuing his appeal.  No further evidence has been submitted.

DECISION

The making of the decision by the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law.  I set aside that decision and make  a  fresh
decision to dismiss the appeal under the  Immigration  Rules  and  on  human
rights grounds.

I make no order for anonymity.
