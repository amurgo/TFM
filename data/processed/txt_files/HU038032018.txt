Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Bazini, of Counsel, instructed by Ata & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction

      1. The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan born in 2011. He  applied
         for entry clearance to come to the UK with his adopted  mother  and
         two siblings to join his adoptive father, who is a British citizen,
         in April 2017. The application, along with those of his mother  and
         siblings, were refused on 15th November 2017.  His  appeal  against
         that decision was dismissed on all grounds by  First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge Chana in a determination  promulgated  on  the  1st  February
         2019. The same determination allowed the  appeals  of  his  adopted
         siblings and adopted mother as it was found that the only issue  in
         their  appeals,  that  there  was  insufficient  accommodation  and
         support, should be determined in their favour. It was accepted also
         that these children were in fact British citizens by  descent  from
         their father who was a British citizen at the time of their births.



      2. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Coker  on
         26th February 2020, and I found that the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
         erred in law for the reasons set out in my  decision  of  2nd  July
         2020 in a decision made on the papers. In that decision,  which  is
         appended to this decision as Annex  A,  I  set  aside  all  of  the
         findings in relation to this appellant as well as the decision,  so
         this appeal is to be remade de novo.

      3. Directions were then sent out for  the  remaking  hearing  to  take
         place by way of a Skype for Business remote hearing in light of the
         need to reduce the transmission of the Covid-19 virus, and in light
         of this being found to be acceptable by both parties, and  being  a
         means by which the appeal could be fairly and justly determined. It
         was not possible for me to join the Skype hearing from the  judges'
         screen so I had to conduct  the  hearing  from  the  court  clerk's
         computer, but there were no other significant technical  issues  of
         connectivity or audibility in the hearing.

      4. Mr Clarke explained at the start of the hearing that he was not  in
         a position to advance a case on behalf of the Secretary of State as
         the decision of 15th November 2017 had been  withdrawn  before  the
         First-tier Tribunal  so  he  would  not  be  cross-  examining  the
         witness, Mr [V], or relying upon the skeleton argument  drafted  by
         his fellow senior presenting officer, Mr Avery, or making any  oral
         submissions. He did however indicate that,  without  advancing  any
         case for the respondent, he thought the correct legal framework was
         paragraphs 309A and 314 of the Immigration Rules, and thus that set
         out in Mr Avery's skeleton argument. He also made it clear that  he
         accepted that it was entirely proper for the appeal to proceed.

      5. The appellant's sponsor and contended adopted father, Mr [ASV] gave
         evidence and there were  submissions  from  Mr  Bazini.  Mr  Bazini
         explained, and Mr [V] confirmed in answer to questions from myself,
         that his wife was not giving  evidence  as  planned  because  their
         youngest child ([YV], born in 2018 after the date of  the  original
         application) had inadvertently swallowed a coin and was in hospital
         having some investigations as he had become unwell and his wife was
         with him. Mr [V] left the hearing having given his evidence so that
         he could join his wife and youngest son in the hospital.

    Submissions - Remaking

      6. In short summary the  evidence  of  Mr  [V],  as  set  out  in  his
         statements and oral evidence, who says that he is  the  appellant's
         de facto adopted father, is as follows.

      7. The appellant's biological parents were killed in a bomb blast away
         from home in Kabul in November 2014 in which the appellant was also
         seriously injured, at a time when the appellant and his  biological
         parents were all living in the [V]s' home as his parents worked for
         the [V] family. When his parents were killed his  adoptive  parents
         sought permission from the appellant's paternal aunt to  adopt  him
         as they had grown close to him and she lived in poverty  and  could
         not care for him due to being disabled, and thus since the  age  of
         three years, now a period of almost 6 years, Mr [V] says that  they
         have brought the appellant up as their child with the same love and
         attention as their own biological children.  The  appellant's  name
         prior to the death of his parents was  [MA],  with  [A]  being  the
         first name, after he became part of the [V] family they added their
         surname to his original name.

      8. There is no possibility under  Afghan  law  to  adopt  a  child  so
         instead Mr [V] obtained guardianship of the appellant, as  set  out
         in the declarations of the appellant's  biological  paternal  aunt,
         Mrs [R], and the headman of  the  Paghman  District  of  Kabul,  Mr
         Mohammad Aman, where they  were  residing.  The  appellant  had  no
         original birth certificate as he and  his  parents  were  displaced
         people who had escaped conflict with  the  Taliban  in  the  Afghan
         district of Midan Shahr, and in any case this is  quite  common  in
         Afghanistan.  With  the  documents  from  the  headman  of  Paghman
         district and Mrs [R], the appellant's paternal  aunt,  Mr  [V]  was
         able to obtain a Tazkira and a passport for the appellant  as  from
         these documents he was then seen as his legal  responsibility.  The
         Tazkira and passport both reflect that the fact that the  appellant
         is now seen as Mr [V]'s son.

      9. The appellant's adoptive family consists of the following  members:
         Mr [ASV], his wife Mrs [SV] and their children, Ms [BAV]  (born  in
         February 2013), Ms [BV] (born in  July  2015)  and  [YV]  (born  in
         2018). Mr [V] entered the UK in 2002 and became a British  citizen.
         In 2012 he returned to Afghanistan and  married  his  wife  in  the
         Paghman district of Kabul. Mr [V] wished  to  bring  his  wife  and
         first child to the  UK  but  an  entry  clearance  application  was
         refused on the basis of his income in 2014. He continued his family
         life with his wife and children by visits to Afghanistan until they
         were able to enter the UK, and tried again to reunite the family in
         the UK by making this entry clearance application for his family in
         2017.

     10. On 24th October  2019  after  Mrs  [V]  and  the  three  biological
         children of the family were granted entry clearance  due  to  their
         appeal having been conceded, so they travelled to the UK to join Mr
         [V]. Mr [V] felt that he had to move these family members to the UK
         at that point due to the difficulties he had had in obtaining entry
         clearance, but he was greatly  saddened  by  having  to  leave  his
         adopted child, the appellant,  behind.  As  the  appellant  had  no
         original biological family he has been left with Mr  [V]'s  sister,
         her husband and their 8 children,  with  this  family  being  given
         ï¿½1000 to care for him until he can be brought to this country.  The
         [V]s have kept in contact with the appellant  using  mobile  phones
         and WhatsApp and had intended to visit  him  too,  but  the  global
         coronavirus pandemic has made visits impossible. The  appellant  is
         greatly missed by his parents and siblings, particularly [BAV].  Mr
         [V] is worried that his sister and her family in Afghanistan cannot
         look after the appellant well due to their struggle to provide  for
         their own children. He is also concerned that he is  being  taunted
         by other children in Afghanistan as a reject due to his history  of
         losing two families, and that he is vulnerable due to his past  and
         facial scars. There  has  been  no  contact  with  the  appellant's
         biological paternal aunt due to  Mr  [V]  being  uncertain  of  her
         whereabouts and the conflict in Maidan  Shahr  making  it  hard  to
         travel there, and enquiries in the Baharestan  district  of  Kabul,
         where she had mentioned once that she stayed, bringing no result.

     11. Mr [V]'s evidence is that in spite of the coronavirus  pandemic  he
         has continued to earn well as a taxi driver working  for  Uber  and
         his other minicab firm Bolt, and that that he currently earns up to
         ï¿½800 per week from this work. He continues  to  live  in  the  same
         three bedroomed house with an additional living room,  kitchen  and
         bathroom as he did when his case was heard  before  the  First-tier
         Tribunal, and so there  is  more  than  sufficient  space  for  the
         appellant to  join  them.  Currently  his  two  daughters  share  a
         bedroom, his two year old son sleeps in the same bedroom  with  him
         and his wife and thus there is a spare bedroom for  the  appellant.
         He believes he can properly accommodate and support  the  appellant
         without recourse to public funds.

     12. It is argued by Mr Bazini argues that the evidence of  Mr  [V]  and
         the documents shows that the appellant has been the subject of a de
         facto adoption which meets  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
         Rules at paragraph 309A as the appellant had lived with his adopted
         mother, Mrs [V], with Mr [V] making frequent visits to  the  family
         home in Afghanistan, for a continuous period of two years and seven
         months (and thus longer than the 18 month required  period  in  the
         Immigration Rules) prior to the making the  application  for  entry
         clearance in July 2017 and for this entire period Mr  and  Mrs  [V]
         had assumed the role of parents,  and  there  had  been  a  genuine
         transfer of parental responsibility.

     13. It is  argued  by  Mr  Bazini  that  there  is  evidence  that  the
         appellant's parents had both died in a bomb blast in  the  Darlaman
         district of Kabul on 16th November 2014 as this is set out  in  the
         petition and agreement of Mrs [R] (paternal aunt of the  appellant)
         and in the statement of the Paghman district headman,  Mr  Mohammad
         Aman, granting Mr [V] guardianship of  the  appellant.  Further  in
         both documents it is stated that his only  relative,  his  paternal
         aunt, Mrs [R], was unable to care for him due to her being disabled
         and impoverished. The history of the bomb blast  is  also  strongly
         supported by  pictures  of  the  appellant  as  a  young  boy  with
         injuries, bandages and facial scarring, some of which show  him  to
         be in hospital. There are also pictures of the  appellant  together
         with the [V]'s biological children and  with  his  adopted  parents
         which show that they have been treating  him  as  a  child  of  the
         family. The appellant's passport and Tazkira  were  issued  by  the
         Afghan authorities in 2015: the Tazkira states that Mr [V]  is  the
         appellant's son and includes his surname, the  passport  gives  the
         appellant the [V] surname, and thus these  documents  are  evidence
         that Mr [V] has  been  officially  recognised  as  having  parental
         responsibility based on the declarations of the aunt and headman.

     14. It is argued by Mr Bazini that the Immigration Rules  at  paragraph
         314 which permit entry clearance to be issued for limited leave  to
         enter with a view to settlement of an adopted  child  of  a  parent
         settled in the UK or given limited leave to enter with  a  view  to
         settlement are also met. It cannot be contested that  314(i)(a)  is
         met as Mr [V] is settled in the UK  and  Mrs  [V]  has  been  given
         limited leave to enter with a view to settlement. It is also  clear
         that paragraphs 314(ii) and (iii) are met as the appellant is under
         the age of 18 years and is not leading an independent life.

     15. Mr [V], it is argued,  is  able  to  accommodate  and  support  the
         appellant without recourse to public funds as he  is  earning  very
         well as a minicab driver and has sufficient space in his home,  and
         his Lloyds Bank statements in the bundle corroborate  his  earnings
         and his tenancy agreement and landlords letter that  his  house  is
         sufficiently spacious, and in addition it  is  noted  that  Mr  [V]
         currently has more than ï¿½18,000  worth  of  savings,  so  paragraph
         314(iv) is met.

     16. The provisions with respect to the de facto adoption  at  paragraph
         314(v) are also argued to be meet. This is because the appellant is
         treated equally with other children of the family; there has been a
         genuine transfer of parental responsibility to Mr and Mr [V] due to
         his original parents inability to care for him as  they  had  died;
         the adoption broke all ties with his original family; and  was  not
         one based on convenience to arranged for the appellant's  admission
         to the UK. It is argued that the adoption was clearly  not  one  of
         convenience as it happened three years prior to the application  to
         admit the appellant to the UK and the evidence  as  set  out  above
         shows conclusively that it was due to his  parents  death  and  his
         biological family's inability to care for him, and that  he  is  an
         equal member of the [V] family. Further it is clear that Mr [V] has
         been very honest in revealing the  background  to  the  appellant's
         inclusion in the family as the Tazkira and passport documents could
         simply indicate he is their biological son, and so Mr [V] would not
         have needed to provide this history if he were not being honest and
         straightforward about the circumstances and there was an  issue  of
         convenience or trafficking.

     17. I indicated to Mr Bazini that he did not need  to  make  submission
         with respect to allowing the  appeal  outside  of  the  Immigration
         Rules on Article 8 ECHR grounds because I was  satisfied  that  the
         appellant had shown  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that  the
         requirements of the Immigration Rules were met, and as  such  there
         was no public interest in  denying  the  appellant  entry  as  such
         denial clearly interfered with his family  life  with  his  adopted
         family and was disproportionate when he could meet the requirements
         of the relevant Immigration Rules.

    Conclusions - Remaking

     18. The Immigration Rules at paragraph 309A and  314  provide  for  the
         admission to the UK with entry clearance of  a  child  who  is  the
         subject of a de facto adoption where the provisions of those  Rules
         are met.

     19. I accept that the evidence of Mr [V] and the documentation  he  has
         produced (the statement and petition of  the  appellant's  paternal
         aunt, the guardianship statement of  the  headman  of  the  Paghman
         district of Kabul, the Tazkira for the appellant, the passport  for
         the appellant and the photographs)  shows that on  the  balance  of
         probabilities the appellant is able to meet the requirements of the
         Immigration Rules for the reasons set out by Mr Bazini. I find that
         Mr [V] is an honest witness, and the  documentation  submitted  for
         this appeal is consistent and reliable.

     20.  I  am  satisfied,  on  the  balance  of  probabilities,  that  the
         appellant's parents died in a bomb explosion  in  Kabul  away  from
         home in November 2014, and that he was injured in  that  explosion,
         was treated in hospital and since that time has been cared  for  by
         Mr and Mrs [V] in their home in Kabul and treated as their  son.  I
         accepted that at the end of 2014 Mr [V] obtained a  statement  from
         the appellant's paternal aunt about her inability to care  for  the
         appellant, and that he was granted guardianship by the  headman  of
         his district, which in turn enabled him to obtain a Tazkira  and  a
         passport for the appellant as his own son in 2015. I find that  the
         appellant's de facto adoption therefore took place on the basis  of
         his original parents  inability  to  care  for  him  as  they  were
         deceased and in the context of no other  biological  family  member
         being able to step in to provide a family and ties with that family
         having come completely to an end, as is  further  evidence  by  the
         current short-term care arrangement for the appellant with Mr [V]'s
         sister and her family.

     21. I find that Mr and Mrs [V] have full  parental  responsibility  for
         the appellant, taking care of him in every way from the time of his
         biological parents' death and that Mr [V] has  been  recognised  by
         the Afghan authorities as his father, and that both of his  parents
         treat him as an equal with their  three  biological  children.  The
         photographs, Tazkira, passport and the evidence of Mr [V] satisfies
         me of these facts. I am satisfied that this was not an adoption  of
         convenience for immigration purposes as it took place  due  to  the
         tragic  death  of  the  appellant's  biological  parents   and   in
         circumstances where  the  appellant  already  lived  with  the  [V]
         family, and where for reasons of love and human kindness Mr and Mrs
         [V] took over the role as his parents. I also  find  that  this  de
         facto adoption took place more than two and a half years  prior  to
         the application for entry clearance.

     22. I am also more than  satisfied  that  there  is  accommodation  and
         maintenance which will  mean  that  the  appellant  will  not  have
         recourse to public funds and will live in the rented house with his
         adoptive family and no others. This was found to be the case by the
         First-tier Tribunal in relation to the  appeal  for  this  adoptive
         mother and two siblings. The Lloyds bank  statement  for  September
         2020 shows Mr [V] bringing in ï¿½2600 from minicab work for Bolt  and
         Uber for this month, and the closing balance on the account on 23rd
         September 2020 is over ï¿½20,000. The tenancy agreement and landlords
         letter reflect that Mr [V] rents  the  accommodation,  for  ï¿½900  a
         month, and it has the various rooms  as  he  has  claimed.  I  find
         therefore that he has shown he  can  accommodate  and  support  the
         appellant without recourse to public funds.

     23. In these circumstances I find that the appellant and the [V] family
         have family life relationships protected under Article  8  ECHR  as
         outlined above with him as an equal adopted son of the family, that
         the refusal of entry clearance interferes with  that  family  life,
         and that the interference is not proportionate as the appellant  is
         able to fulfil the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  and  so
         there  is  no  public  interest  in  his  exclusion  from  the  UK.






    Decision:

      1. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved  the
         making of an error on a point of law.

      2. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing  the
         appeal of this appellant  and  all  of  the  findings  of  fact  in
         relation to him.

      3. I remake the appeal allowing it on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

Annex A: Error of Law Decision and Directions

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction

      1. The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan born in 2011. He  applied
         for entry clearance to come to the UK with his adopted  mother  and
         two siblings to  join  his  adoptive  father  in  April  2017.  The
         application, along with those of  his  mother  and  siblings,  were
         refused on 15th November 2017. His appeal against that decision was
         dismissed on all grounds by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Chana  in  a
         determination promulgated  on  the  1st  February  2019,  the  same
         determination allowed the  appeals  of  his  adopted  siblings  and
         adopted mother.

      2. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Coker  on
         26th February 2020 on all grounds on the basis that it is  arguable
         that the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in  law  in  failing  to  make
         findings as to whether the appellant had lived and been brought  up
         by the sponsoring family unit, and finding  it  arguable  that  not
         being formally  adopted  did  not  preclude  family  life  existing
         between the appellant and the sponsoring family.

      3. In light of the need to take  precautions  against  the  spread  of
         Covid-19 and with regard to the overriding object set  out  in  the
         Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules to decide matters fairly and  justly
         directions were sent out to the parties  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
         Mandalia by email on 30th April 2020 seeking written submissions on
         the assertion of an error of law with a view  to  determining  that
         issue on the papers, and giving an opportunity for  any  party  who
         felt that a hearing was necessary in the interests  of  justice  to
         make submissions on that issue too. Submissions were  not  received
         from the appellant's solicitors, Times PBS Ltd, but  were  received
         from the Secretary of State in response to these directions.

      4. The matter came before  me  to  determine  whether  it  is  in  the
         interests of justice to decide this matter without a hearing and if
         so to determine whether the First-tier Tribunal has erred in law. I
         find that it is appropriate to determine whether there is an  error
         of law on the papers despite the fact that nothing further has been
         received by those instructed by the  appellant  as  the  appeal  is
         conceded by Ms A Fijiwala of the Specialist Appeals Team,  for  the
         Secretary of State.

    Submissions - Error of Law

      5. In the grounds of appeal it is argued, in short summary as follows.
         It is contended that the First-tier Tribunal erred in  law  in  not
         making clear findings as to whether  the appellant had  lived  with
         his adoptive family (sponsor  and  other  appellants)  since  2014,
         which  is  supported  by  a  lot   of   photographs   although   no
         consideration is given to them, whilst disbelieving  other  matters
         (such as the history of the deaths of the appellant's  parents  and
         adoption) but not making a finding as to whether it would be in his
         best interests to  remain  with  this  family  given  that  he  had
         potentially  lived  with  them  from  the  age  of  3   years,   or
         consideration as to what the alternatives would be for  him  if  he
         were left in Afghanistan without them.

      6. There is also no proper consideration as to whether  the  appellant
         had been adopted by the  sponsor,  because  even  if  it  were  not
         believed that the appellant's parents were dead he still could have
         been adopted. The First-tier  Tribunal  wrongly  asserts  that  the
         document  from  the  headman  of  Pagman  district  concerning  the
         guardianship of the child contains inconsistent information when it
         does not, and further it was not considered in the round  with  the
         other evidence, such as the appellant's passport with  his  surname
         name changed to that of the sponsor and other appellants which  was
         apparently accepted as genuine and would indicate that  the  Afghan
         authorities were satisfied he had been adopted by them.

      7. There was also  a  failure  to  consider  the  photographs  of  the
         appellant in hospital  injured  and  scarred,  which  supports  the
         contention that he and his parents were in a bomb blast,  and  that
         the parents were killed  as  recorded  in  the  document  from  the
         headman. There is also a failure to consider the  petition  by  the
         paternal aunt of the appellant, and an irrational finding that this
         person would not be the appellant's only relative as  all  families
         are large in Afghanistan. Other conclusions  with  respect  to  the
         aunt and the appellant  are  also  argued  to  be  speculative  and
         unsupported.

      8. Ms Fijiwala for the Secretary of State in her letter  of  18th  May
         2020 in response to the  directions  of  Judge  Mandalia  does  not
         oppose the appeal, and accepts that the  First-tier  Tribunal  made
         speculative findings which are not supported by evidence in respect
         of the consideration by reference  to  the  Immigration  Rules  and
         accepts that there was no substantive  consideration  generally  in
         relation to  Article  8  ECHR.  She  therefore  invites  the  Upper
         Tribunal to set aside the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  and
         list the matter for a remote remaking hearing.

    Conclusions - Error of Law

      9. I find that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  failed  to  accurately
         consider  the  evidence  before  her,  and  made  speculative   and
         irrational findings on that evidence when considering  the  history
         put forward by the sponsor on the appellant's  behalf.  The  First-
         tier Tribunal failed thereby properly to  consider  the  appeal  by
         reference to the Immigration Rules, and also failed to  reason  the
         Article 8 ECHR appeal by reference to the full facts  of  the  case
         and the appellant's best interests as a  child.  I  set  aside  the
         decision in relation to this appellant and also all of the findings
         of fact which relate to the appellant at paragraphs  24  to  37  of
         this decision.




    Decision:

      1. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved  the
         making of an error on a point of law.

      2. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing  the
         appeal of this appellant  and  all  of  the  findings  of  fact  in
         relation to him.

      3. I adjourn the remaking of the appeal.
