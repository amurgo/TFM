                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal to the Upper Tribunal brought on behalf of the  Entry
    Clearance Officer by the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department.
    The appeal  is  from  a  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Cox
    (hereinafter "the tribunal") which  it  made  after  a  hearing  of  11
    January 2018 and which it sent to  the  parties  on  25  January  2018;
    whereupon it allowed the claimant's appeal from a decision of the Entry
    Clearance Officer of 20  April  2016  to  refuse  to  grant  him  entry
    clearance to  come  to  the  United  Kingdom  ("UK")  with  a  view  to
    settlement. The appeal is brought with the permission of a Judge of the
    Upper Tribunal.

 2. The claimant, who was born on 28 March 1988, is a national of Pakistan.
    He is married to his UK based sponsor who is a British citizen. The two
    are related outside of the marriage in that they are first cousins. The
    claimant entered the UK lawfully as a student. His  leave  was  due  to
    expire on 18 February 2013. However, he made an application for further
    leave as a student which was granted up to 25 November 2014. As part of
    the process of applying for that latter period of leave he had to sit a
    TOEIC English language test. It is said that he did so in  February  of
    2013. No issue was taken at the time regarding his contention  that  he
    took the test himself in accordance with normal rules and  formalities.
    During the period of the claimant's further  leave  as  a  student  the
    educational institution he was attending closed down. That prompted him
    to leave the UK and return to Pakistan which he did on 16 July 2014. On
    20 August 2014 the claimant and the sponsor married in Pakistan. On  24
    August 2014 the sponsor returned to the UK although  the  couple  spent
    some further time together in Pakistan between 8 December 2015  and  15
    December 2015. The claimant sought entry clearance in order to join his
    UK based sponsor with a view to settlement  but,  as  noted,  such  was
    refused on 20 April 2016.

 3. One of the bases for refusal was that the Entry Clearance  Officer  was
    satisfied that the claimant had  contrived  in  a  significant  way  to
    undermine the intentions of the Immigration Rules  (see  paragraph  320
    (11) of the Immigration Rules. The Entry Clearance  Officer  took  that
    view because of evidence he thought to be persuasive to the effect that
    in taking his TOEIC English language test in the UK, the  claimant  had
    used a proxy test-taker. Additionally, and because of what was  thought
    to be the claimant's dishonesty in that respect,  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer also decided that he should be excluded under  the  suitability
    requirements of the Immigration Rules contained within section S-EC  of
    Appendix FM; that his relationship with his sponsor was not  a  genuine
    and subsisting one; and they did not  intend  to  live  together  as  a
    couple. The Entry Clearance Officer also  decided  that  the  financial
    eligibility requirements within the  Immigration  Rules  were  not  met
    either.

 4. As indicated, the appeal was heard by the tribunal on 11 January  2018.
    Both parties were represented. The claimant, being out of the  country,
    could not attend but his sponsor did do and she gave oral evidence.

 5. It is clear  from  the  tribunal's  careful  written  reasons  that  it
    recognised a need to consider the situation under the Immigration Rules
    even though the appeal before it  had  been  brought  on  human  rights
    grounds under Article 8 of the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights
    (ECHR). As to that, an integral consideration was whether  or  not  the
    claimant had used  a  proxy  test-taker  and,  hence,  contrived  in  a
    significant way to undermine the intentions of the  Immigration  Rules.
    As to that discrete but important issue, the tribunal said this:

         "39.     The ECO noted that the Appellant had submitted  I  support
         of his application for leave to remain in the UK TOEIC  certificate
         from educational testing service (ETS).

         The ECO stated:

             "ETS has a record of [the Appellant's]  speaking  test.  Using
             voice verification software, ETS is  able  to  detect  when  a
             single person is undertaking multiple tests. ETS  undertook  a
             check of [the Appellant's] test and confirmed to the SSHD that
             there  was  significant  evidence  to   conclude   that   [the
             Appellants] certificate was fraudulently obtained by use of  a
             proxy test taker.  [The  Appellant's]  scores  have  now  been
             cancelled by ETS"

         40.      Accordingly, the ECO  was  satisfied  that  the  Appellant
         obtained his English language  test  certificate  fraudulently  and
         that he used deception in his application.

         41.      As to the aggravating factors, the ECO stated

             "In fraudulently obtaining a TOEIC certificate in  the  manner
             outlined above, the Appellant willingly participated  in  what
             was clearly  an  organised  and  serious  attempt,  given  the
             complicity of the test centre itself, to defraud the SSHD  and
             others."

         42.       This  appeal  is  one  of  many   that   challenges   the
         Respondent's reliance on ETS evidence that test  certificates  were
         fraudulently  obtained.  The  background  to  the   litigation   is
         summarised in SM and Qadir  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department (ETS - Evidence - Burden of Proof [2016] UKUT 229 (IAC).
         I have also considered SSHD v Shehzad and Chowdhury [2016] EWCA Civ
         615. These cases establish the following principles:

             (i) The Secretary of State must show that  there  is,  on  the
             face  of  it,  evidence  of  deception  (otherwise  known   as
             discharging the evidential burden);

             (ii)      If the Secretary of State clears  this  hurdle,  the
             burden  shifts  to  the  individual  to  provide  a  plausible
             innocent explanation (again, on the face of it);

             (iii)     If the individual provides such an explanation, then
             the burden shifts back to the Secretary of State  to  disprove
             (aka the legal burden of proving fraud);

             (iv)      The standard of proof is on balance of probabilities
             (ie. It must be more likely than  not  that  fraud  has  taken
             place); and

             (v) Stronger and better quality evidence is required to  prove
             a more serious allegation (see �� 57 to 60 in Qadir).

         43.      In support of this appeal, the Respondent provided witness
         statements from Rebecca Collings and Peter Millington (known as the
         Respondent's 'generic data evidence' in respect of ETS cases),  and
         extract from the ETS Selt Source data and from the ETS  TOEIC  test
         centre Look Up Tool.

         44.      The Respondent's generic evidence was summarised in  SM  &
         Qadir  at  paragraphs  11  and  20  of  the  upper  tribunal  [sic]
         determination. I do not intend to  rehearse  those  passages  here,
         suffice to say that following  a  panorama  programme  in  February
         2014, ETS analysed test results from  numerous  test  centres.  ETS
         devised two categories for those results that  they  identified  as
         being flawed. Firstly, ETS described that any test  categorised  as
         cancelled (which is now known as invalid) had the  same  voice  for
         multiple test takers. ETS were certain there was evidence of  proxy
         test taking of impersonation in those cases. Secondly,  there  were
         tests categorised as 'questionable'. In either case, ETS  cancelled
         the test result.

         45.      I note that in SM & Qadir, Dr Harrison identified numerous
         shortcomings in the voice analysis procedure adopted  by  ETS  (see
         paragraph 36 of the upper tribunal determination).

         46.      In Shehzad, the Court  of  Appeal  were  critical  of  the
         Respondent's evidence (paragraph 30 of LJ Beatson's  judgment).  In
         particular, LJ Beatson stated that there did  not  appear  to  have
         been any material before the tribunal to  show  that  Mr  Shehzad's
         TOEIC speaking English test had been adjudged to  be  "invalid"  as
         opposed to "questionable".

         47.      In my view, the Respondent's evidence in the present  case
         is different. The Respondent has provided the ETS SELT Source  Data
         extract, which states that the Appellant's speaking test  taken  at
         Cauldon College on 20 February 2013 is  invalid  (annex  B  of  the
         Respondent's ETS bundle). I  also  note  that  in  judicial  review
         proceedings,  the  upper  tribunal  held  that  such  evidence  was
         sufficient to discharge the respondent's initial  burden:  R  (app.
         Nawaz v SSHD (ETS: review standard  evidential  basis)  [2017  UKUT
         288.

         48.      I am satisfied on the basis of the above evidence that the
         necessary evidential threshold to require the Appellant to  explain
         the circumstances surrounding the test has been met.

         49.      The Appellant asserted that he had properly  obtained  the
         TOEIC test certificate. He  said  that  he  had  sat  the  test  in
         February 2013 and received the certificate a few  weeks  later.  He
         also  stated  that  he  had  no  reason  to  obtain  a  certificate
         fraudulently as his level of English was sufficient  (paragraph  12
         of his witness statement). He noted that the degree he had obtained
         in Pakistan had been taught in both Urdu and English and that  when
         he arrived in the UK,  he  had  no  difficulty  in  conversing  and
         reading and writing in English.

         50.      However, the presenting officer has not been able to cross
         examine the Appellant and the Appellant's account lacks detail. For
         example, he has not explained  why  he  sat  the  test  at  Cauldon
         College. The presenting officer noted that it would have been  open
         to the Appellant to give evidence via Skype or another social media
         site.

         51.      On the other hand,  the  Appellant  had  been  living  and
         studying in the UK for two years before sitting the TOEIC test.  He
         had also obtained a level 5 HND Diploma.

         52.      In any event, the respondent has not provided  me  with  a
         statement  of  report  specifically  relating  to   the   Appellant
         explaining in detail why the person listening to the interview  and
         those against which it has been compared believes the recordings to
         be of the same person rather than different people. I have not been
         provided with the recordings of the  interview  or  the  interviews
         against which it was recorded. The  respondent's  generic  evidence
         states that the test is kept for 999 days. As the Appellant's  test
         was taken in February 2013, it would have been destroyed  prior  to
         20 April 2016. The Appellant has therefore never had the chance  to
         have the test assessed.

         53.      In addition, the statements of Rebecca Collings and  Peter
         Millington do not relate specifically to the  Appellant.  Professor
         French does not rule out that the  listening  assessment  could  be
         flawed.

         54.       Further,  the  Project  Fa�ade  report  does  not  relate
         specifically to the Appellant. Significantly the repost stated that
         there is an ongoing criminal investigation, but the report is  over
         two years old and there is nothing to suggest that anyone from  the
         college has been charged, let alone convicted of an offence.

         55.      In my view, the final factor that tips the balance in  the
         Appellant's favour is his good immigration history.  The  Appellant
         returned to Pakistan after his college closed, and this was  before
         the Home Office decided to revoke his leave to remain in the UK. In
         my view, this goes to the Appellant credit [sic] and is  indicative
         of a good character.

         56.      On the totality of the evidence and, on  balance,  I  find
         that the Respondent failed to discharge the burden  of  proof.  The
         Respondent has not satisfied me that the Appellant did  not  attend
         the test centre of that  he  fraudulently  obtained  a  TOEIC  test
         certificate. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that  the  Appellant's
         general credibility has been undermined."

6.    The tribunal then went on to explain why  it  thought  all  the  other
    relevant requirements of the Immigration Rules had been  met.  It  then
    conducted an assessment of the Article 8 position, applying the  5-fold
    test set out in the well-known case of Razgar v SSHD  (2004)  UKHL  27.
    That assessment was informed by its view  that  the  Immigration  Rules
    were met. The tribunal said this:

         "69.     On the totality of the evidence, I am satisfied that there
         is a potential family life between the Appellant  and  the  Sponsor
         that ought to be respected.

         70.      Moreover, given the  low  threshold,  I  am  satisfied  in
         response to question (2) that the  interference  arising  from  the
         decision to refuse  the  Appellant  leave  to  enter  the  UK  will
         potentially have consequences of such  gravity  as  to  engage  the
         operation of Article 8. In my view, the decision may interfere with
         the development of their family life.

         71.      The refusals are in  accordance  with  the  law  (question
         (3)). In relation to questions 4 & 5, I believe that they ought  to
         be  considered  together  and  I  have  to  consider   whether   an
         interference with the person's right to  respect  for  private  and
         family life is justified under Article 8(2)  (the  public  interest
         question, s117A(3) of the 2002  Act).  In  considering  the  public
         interest it is for me to  balance  the  Respondent's  interests  in
         maintaining the economic  wellbeing  of  the  country  against  the
         Appellant and the Sponsor's right to respect of their family life.

         72.      Ultimately, the question for me to determine is how a fair
         balance  should  be  struck  between  the  competing   public   and
         individual interests involved,  applying  a  proportionality  test:
         paragraph 60 of R (Agyarko v SSHD; R (Ikuga) v SSHD [2017] UKSC 11.

         73.      When  assessing  proportionality,  my  starting  point  is
         whether the Appellant meets  the  immigration  rules:  Lord  Reed's
         paragraphs 39 to 43 of Hesham Ali v SSHD [2016] UKSC 60 [2016 1 WLR
         4799.

         74.      Accordingly, I now consider whether  the  Appellant  meets
         the requirements of the rules. For the reasons  set  out  above,  I
         have concluded that the Respondent has not satisfied  me  that  the
         Appellant falls to  be  refused  under  paragraph  320(11)  of  the
         immigration rules of the suitability requirements of Appendix FM.

         75.      I have also found that there is a family life between  the
         Appellant and the Sponsor.  Accordingly,  I  also  find  that  thee
         couple are in a genuine and subsisting relationship and  that  they
         intend to live together as husband and wife. I  am  satisfied  that
         the Appellant meets the relationship requirements of Appendix FM.

         76.      Therefore, the outstanding issue is whether the  Appellant
         meets the financial eligibility requirements of the rules. The  ECO
         accepted that the Sponsor is exempt from meeting the requirement of
         paragraph E-ECP.3.1. Instead  the  Appellant  must  show  that  the
         couple  can  be  maintained  and  accommodated  adequately  without
         recourse to public funds: E-ECP.3.3(b).

         77.      The ECO noted that the  level  of  income  support  for  a
         couple over the age of 18 is �114.85 per week. The ECO  also  noted
         that the Sponsor was receiving �62.10 per week in Carers  Allowance
         and that the Appellant stated that the Sponsor  earned  �80.40  per
         week working part time for Salaam Foods.

         78.      The ECO  stated  that  a  search  on  Google  Street  View
         highlighted  that  the  business  at  the  stated  address   is   a
         convenience  store  named  Nisa  Local.  Further,  an  officer  had
         attempted to contact the Sponsor's employer  by  telephone  several
         times on the number provided in the employer's letter,  but  nobody
         answered the telephone.

         79.      The ECO acknowledged that  the  Sponsor's  Santander  bank
         statement  shows  payments  consistent  with  the  standard  format
         payslips provided under reference 'SALAAM FOODS'. However, the  ECO
         asserted that it is  not  difficult  with  an  online  banking  for
         someone to allocate a reference when making a  payment,  especially
         as the payments are  "faster  payments"  which  are  simply  online
         transfers, rather than BACS.

         80.      The ECO also acknowledged that  Home  Office  checks  with
         HMRC confirmed that income tax is being paid at  the  rate  of  pay
         stated in the  visa  application,  but  also  stated  this  is  not
         difficult to arrange. The  ECO  concluded  that  in  light  of  the
         Appellant's general credibility and the  issues  identified  above,
         the Appellant had  failed  to  demonstrate  that  the  Sponsor  was
         employed as claimed by Salaam Foods and was not satisfied that  the
         couple were able to maintain and accommodate themselves  adequately
         in the UK without recourse to public funds.

         81.      The Appellant provided a letter from the owner  of  Salaam
         Foods, dated 16 December 2015 (page 271 of the Appellant's bundle).
         The business address recoded on  the  letter  is  660  Huddersfield
         Road, whereas the ECO searched for 7 Fir Road.  The  Sponsor  noted
         that here is a Nisa Local convenience  store  at  708  Huddersfield
         Road, which is 200 metres away  from  Salaam  Foods.  She  provided
         extracts from Google maps which show the respective addresses.  The
         presenting officer did not challenge this aspect of  the  Sponsor's
         evidence.

         82.      The Sponsor also noted that it was  not  unusual  for  the
         shop to ignore phone calls. She explained that when they were  busy
         dealing with customers, they would simply not have time to pick  up
         the telephone.

         83.      As noted by the ECO, the Appellant provided  payslips  and
         bank statements that were  consistent  with  each  other  and  that
         checks with HMRC confirmed that the Sponsor was paying tax  on  the
         income. Overall, I have no reason to doubt the Sponsor's account of
         her employment at the date of the application.

         84.      However, the Sponsor's circumstances have changed. Since 1
         March 2016 the Sponsor has been employed as a cleaner for A1  Osset
         and Amber Cars. The Sponsor told me that she works for the  company
         Monday to Saturday from 6 to 8 am. The Sponsor told me that  whilst
         she is working, her grandmother is  usually  asleep.  If  she  does
         wake, the Sponsor's mother will help until the Sponsor returns from
         work.

         85.      The Sponsor provided wage slips for the company (pages 285
         to 300 of the Appellant's original bundle and pages 7 to 12 of  the
         Appellant supplementary bundle). The Sponsor also provided her  P60
         for the tax year ending March 2017 (page  301  of  the  Appellant's
         original bundle).

         86.      In addition, the Sponsor's bank statements show credits of
         "A1 OSSETT HORBU" of �390 at the end of every month (for example on
         30/11/2017 at page 22 of the Appellant's supplementary bundle).

         87.      On the totality of the evidence I am satisfied that  since
         May 2015 the Sponsor has been in receipt of a total  weekly  income
         of between �140 and �150. Her income is more than  a  couple  would
         receive on benefit. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the couple can
         be maintained and accommodate adequately without recourse to public
         funds. I find that the Appellant met the financial requirements  of
         Appendix FM and that  he  met  all  the  requirement  s  for  entry
         clearance as a partner.

         88.      However, this is  not  determinative  of  the  appeal.  In
         Secretary of State for the Home Department v SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA
         Civ 387 the Court of Appeal drew a distinction between in  -country
         cases and overseas cases. The Court  stated  that  the  immigration
         rules are more than a mere starting point (paragraph  32),  but  in
         overseas cases there is a greater margin of  appreciation  afforded
         to the Respondent.

         89.      In accordance with section 117A of the 2002 Act, I confirm
         that, when considering the public interest question,  I  have  also
         had regard to the factors listed in section 117B (2) - (5)  of  the
         Act. I  am  satisfied  that  none  of  the  factors  apply  to  the
         Appellant.

         90.       I  am  also  satisfied  that  as  the  Sponsor   is   her
         grandmother's primary carer, she cannot reasonably be  expected  to
         live in Pakistan.

         91.      Further, section 117B (1)  of  the  2002  Act  as  amended
         states that the maintenance of effective immigration control is  in
         the public interest. In my  view  'effective  immigration  control'
         includes  recognising  that  those   individuals   who   meet   the
         requirements of the rules ought to be  allowed  to  enter  the  UK.
         Especially as "the rules are  statements  of  the  practice  to  be
         followed, which are approved by Parliament, and are  based  on  the
         Secretary of State's policy  as  to  how  individual  rights  under
         article  8  should  be  balanced  against  the   competing   public
         interests" (paragraph 46 of R (Agyarko)).

         92.      On balance, I am satisfied that the proposed  interference
         with the Appellant and the Sponsor's family life is unnecessary and
         disproportionate. Their rights outweigh the Respondent's legitimate
         interests in ensuring economic and social order, whilst maintaining
         a  coherent  system  of  immigration  control.  I   have   attached
         significant weight to my  finding  that  the  Appellant  meets  the
         requirements for entry clearance as a partner".

7.    That is why the appeal succeeded. However, that was  not  the  end  of
    the matter because the Secretary  of  State  on  behalf  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer applied for and obtained permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal. The primary contention made in the  grounds  of  appeal
    was that the tribunal had failed to adequately explain  its  view  that
    the claimant had not used a proxy test-taker and  in  particular,  with
    respect to that assessment, had failed to remind  itself  that  even  a
    person who has no need to rely upon fraud because his level of  English
    is sufficient, might still have other reasons for using a proxy. As  to
    the Article 8 assessment, it  was  contended  that  it  was  an  unsafe
    assessment because the fraud finding which had  informed  it  had  been
    unsafe; that the tribunal had wrongly directed itself  that  Article  8
    was concerned with the "development" of family life  rather  than  with
    protecting existing family life; and that the tribunal  had  failed  to
    identify "adequately compelling circumstances" such as to  justify  its
    conclusion that the decision  under  appeal  before  it  constituted  a
    disproportionate interference with Article 8 rights.

8.    The Judge who granted permission to appeal said this:

         "Arguably, following MA (ETS-TOEIC testing) [2016] UKUT 450  (IAC),
         the judge needed to consider other reasons why someone might choose
         to take a test by proxy, before accepting that his English language
         skills made this unnecessary".

9.    Permission having been granted, the matter was listed  for  a  hearing
    before the Upper Tribunal (before me) so that  consideration  could  be
    given as to whether or not the tribunal had erred in law  and,  if  so,
    what should flow from that.  Representation  at  that  hearing  was  as
    stated above and I am grateful to each representative.

10.   Mr Diwnycz relied upon  the  written  grounds  and  did  not  seek  to
    materially add to them. Having heard from him I was able to indicate to
    Miss Hashmi that I need not  trouble  her.  I  have  decided  that  the
    tribunal did not err in law. That has the consequence that its decision
    shall stand. I shall now explain why I have decided that there  was  no
    error of law.

11.   As to the tribunal's assessment with respect to  the  fraud  issue,  I
    have  set  it  out  above.  It  is,  in  my  judgment,  a  careful  and
    comprehensive assessment encompassing, as it does, an evaluation of the
    evidence relied upon by the Secretary of State and a  view,  which  was
    relevant, as to the claimant's general credibility (see paragraph 55 of
    the written reasons). It is true that the tribunal did not specifically
    remind itself, as was indeed noted in  MA  cited  above,  that  even  a
    person who is competent in English might have  a  motive  unrelated  to
    that competence for using a proxy. But the view that the  claimant  had
    sufficient competence in English not to use a proxy was  not  a  matter
    which the tribunal relied upon or, at least, one which it  relied  upon
    to a significant extent. It is true that is said, at  paragraph  49  of
    its written reasons, that it was part of the claimant's case that,  for
    that reason, he would not have to use a proxy but it did not then go on
    to indicate that that had been a factor in its actual  conclusion  that
    one had not been used. Once that is realised then it seems to  me  that
    the point loses all force. Additionally and in any event, it is  really
    a matter of common sense that even a competent claimant might  wish  to
    use a proxy, and there  is  nothing  in  the  tribunal's  reasoning  to
    suggest that it lost sight of that or overlooked it. But the key  point
    is that this whole issue was not a significant one with respect to  its
    reasoning.

12.   Turning then to the various other  contentions  in  the  grounds  with
    regard to the Article 8 assessment, since I have decided  the  tribunal
    did not err with respect  to  its  paragraph  320(11)  conclusions,  it
    cannot be said that its Article 8 assessment was tainted in the  manner
    suggested in the grounds. As to the question of Article 8 being engaged
    at all, I did find  it  odd  that  the  tribunal  talked  in  terms  of
    "potential family life" (see paragraph 69 of the written reasons) but I
    think it must have been deciding, in context, that given  the  fact  of
    the marriage and subsequent visit  to  Pakistan  on  the  part  of  the
    Sponsor, there was actual family life. That  finding  and  its  related
    conclusion that Article 8 was engaged was, on  the  facts  and  in  the
    circumstances  of  the  case,  open  to  it.  As  to   the   tribunal's
    proportionality assessment, it was a significant consideration that  it
    had concluded that the requirements of the Immigration Rules were  met.
    Its ultimate conclusion as to proportionality was, again, open to it. I
    did wonder whether I should be concerned about the  tribunal's  comment
    at paragraph 70 of its written reasons to the effect that the threshold
    for the engagement of Article 8 is "low". In AG Eritrea v  SSHD  (2007)
    EWCA Civ 801 it was said that the threshold was not a  "specially  high
    one". That does not necessarily mean that it is low. So, it is possible
    that the tribunal was setting the bar too low but it is,  nevertheless,
    apparent that it would have reached the same view as to engagement  had
    it not done so given all of its other findings.

13.   For the above reasons this appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

Decision

14.   The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making  of
    an error of law. It follows that that decision shall stand.

    I may make no anonymity direction. None was sought.
