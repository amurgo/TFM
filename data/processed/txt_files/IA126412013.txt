Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Seddon, instructed by JCWI (Joint Council for
                    the Welfare
     of Immigrants)
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a  28  year  old  citizen  of  the  Philippines.   She
    entered the United Kingdom on 7 July 2011 on a Tier 4 (General) Student
    visa valid until 12 December 2012.  She had  enrolled  to  study  on  a
    course in Healthcare Management at level 7 at the Practice  Development
    Unit in Derby and paid for it.  She was shabbily treated by them.   The
    course ended after two months.  She then was given a choice, which  was
    not really a choice, of enrolling on a general leadership course of  no
    use to her.  Having no viable alternative she went on that course.  The
    Practice Development Unit then closed and went into  liquidation.   She
    ended up having paid by her own standards a substantial  sum  of  money
    for a course or courses that were useless to her and were  not  in  any
    event completed.  Put very bluntly, she had paid a  lot  of  money  for
    nothing.

2.   She had a happier time doing the twenty  hours'  work  which  her  visa
    permitted as a Senior Care Worker at a care home for  elderly  patients
    with dementia rated excellent by  the  Care  Quality  Commission.   Her
    employer gave evidence at the First-tier  Tribunal  hearing  which  was
    accepted without reservation by Judge Dearden.  She  was  an  excellent
    care worker who had formed a close and  caring  relationship  with  the
    inmates of the care home.

3.   On 10 December 2012 she applied during the currency  of  her  visa  for
    leave to remain as a Tier 2  (General)  Migrant.   She  filled  in  the
    requisite form.  Her form was however accompanied by a four page letter
    from the Joint  Council  for  the  Welfare  of  Immigrants  drafted  by
    somebody  who  clearly  had  a  good  understanding  of  the   relevant
    Immigration Rules.  Having referred to the various documents that  were
    enclosed to accompany the form as required by  the  Rules,  the  author
    wrote as follows:-

         "We are of course aware that students are not normally permitted to
         switch in-country into the  work  category  and  have  advised  our
         client of this.  However we  believe  that  there  are  exceptional
         circumstances in this case which justify the grant of a Tier 2 visa
         to Ms Brillantes."


4.   There is  then  set  out  at  somewhat  greater  length  than  we  have
    summarised the unhappy experience that the  appellant  had  during  her
    time after her  arrival  in  the  United  Kingdom.   It  also  referred
    expressly to the highly favourable view which her employer  had  formed
    of her.  Under the heading "Tier 2 (General)" the author of the  letter
    wrote:

         "Our client meets the requirements for the  position  as  a  senior
         carer at Chamber Mount and her employer has offered her a full-time
         position in this capacity subject of course to her being  permitted
         to switch into Tier 2.  The Certificate of  Sponsorship  number  is
         C2G5S14366A.   The  advertising  requirements  have  been  met   as
         confirmed in the COS.  Ms Brillantes'  salary  is  �7.80  per  hour
         which is the correct rate as stipulated in  the  relevant  Code  of
         Practice (6115) for senior carers  making  new  applications.   Her
         Diploma in Nursing has been assessed by NARIC in their letter dated
         12 November 2012 as being equivalent to an HND qualification in the
         same subject.  We understand that this is the correct  skill  level
         for those working as senior carers.  However our  client  also  has
         several years' relevant experience, as she  has  explained  in  her
         statement, including 17 months in the  UK.   Ms  Brillantes  should
         therefore be granted the necessary 50 points for the COS."


    The paragraph went on  to  state  correctly,  that  she  satisfied  the
    remaining requirements of the relevant part of Appendix A.


5.   Under an extended passage headed "Secretary of State's  Policy  towards
    Senior Carers" the author of the letter referred to a policy introduced
    by the Secretary of State on 13  August  2007  towards  senior  carers,
    which had arisen because of the difficulties experienced by  those  who
    run care homes of recruiting suitably qualified and enthusiastic staff.
     The letter concluded, "for the  above  reasons  we  believe  that  our
    client, Karoma Brillantes, should be granted a Tier 2 visa".

6.   On 2 April 2013 the Secretary of State refused  the  application.   She
    appealed in time to the First-tier Tribunal.  The reasons stated in the
    decision letter for refusal were that the appellant did not qualify for
    50 points for sponsorship for salary and that the work in which she was
    occupied part-time did not correspond  to  the  list  of  NQF  level  6
    occupations and salary  adjusted  to  the  full-time  equivalent.   Her
    salary was in other words  �4,900  a  year  below  the  minimum  salary
    threshold of �20,000.  Mr Seddon who appears for her  below  and  today
    conceded that she did not qualify under  the  Immigration  Rules.   His
    claim was put in two alternative ways.

7.   First, that the Secretary of State had not considered  her  application
    outside the Immigration Rules and secondly that the  decision  did  not
    give full weight to her right to respect for private life under Article
    8 ECHR.  The decision letter makes no  reference  to  the  exercise  of
    discretion  outside  the  Rules  and  so  does  not  suggest  that  any
    consideration was given to the grant of leave to remain as a result  of
    the exercise of such a discretion.   Mr  Seddon  submitted  accordingly
    that the decision was not in accordance with  the  law.   This  is  his
    principal though not only ground of challenge in this appeal.

8.   Mr Melvin, the Home Office Presenting Officer submits simply that  this
    was an application made under Tier 2 on a Tier  2  form.   Accordingly,
    the decision-maker  was  not  required  to  consider  the  exercise  of
    discretion outside the Rules.

9.   The two  propositions  stated  are  attractively  simple  but  in  fact
    conceal a number of policy considerations which it is necessary for  us
    to consider.

10.  The points-based system was  established  to  permit  applications  for
    certain categories of visa to be dealt with in large volume and with  a
    high degree of certainty of outcome.  In  principle,  applicants  would
    know what requirements they had to satisfy.   If  they  satisfied  them
    their application would succeed.  If not, it  would  fail.   There  are
    accordingly benefits for  applicants  for  these  categories  of  visa.
    There are also benefits  for  public  administration:  decisions  which
    simply require facts and information to be checked to  see  whether  or
    not they comply with a detailed list  of  requirements  are  easier  to
    administer and  execute  than  those  which  require  the  exercise  of
    discretion.  Accordingly, there is an advantage in the saving  of  cost
    and in the speed with which applications can be determined  and  so  in
    the volume which can be determined on a given cost and  staffing  base.
    We readily  acknowledge  that  the  introduction  of  the  exercise  of
    discretion into that exercise would frustrate its basic purpose.

11.  Mr Melvin submits that when a form comes in applying for a Tier 2  visa
    it goes to a particular division of UKBA which is used to dealing  with
    such  applications.   It  is  possible  that  in   the   future   human
    intervention in the process may  be  reduced  simply  to  checking  the
    output of a computer  system  which  has  generated  automatically  the
    answer.  If and when that occurs, the problems which it  may  throw  up
    will have to be dealt with, initially at least on a case by case basis.
     But what happens now when an application is made for  a  Tier  2  visa
    which on its face makes it clear that the Secretary of State  is  being
    invited to exercise a discretion outside the terms governing the  grant
    of a Tier 2 visa and so outside the Rules?

12.  One of our member,  Judge  Craig  and  Mr  Seddon  both  have  previous
    experience of such applications and of how they are  dealt  with.   Our
    understanding based on that previous experience is that they are either
    routinely, or at least frequently dealt with by a decision letter which
    refers to and so evidences the exercise of a discretion.  To  take  the
    simplest example, in the case of a hard luck  case  such  as  this  one
    which does not fit within the Rules, the application for a Tier 2  visa
    might be rejected and a decision made often expressed only in a  single
    paragraph that despite the merits of the application the  Secretary  of
    State will not exercise a discretion outside the Rules to grant it.  As
    Mr Seddon concedes, that suffices  subject  always  eventually  to  the
    rationality and lawfulness of the ultimate decision.

13.  Returning to the terms of the letter, the significant  parts  of  which
    we have set out verbatim earlier in this judgment, it is obvious to  us
    and in our judgment should have been obvious to a human reader in  UKBA
    that it was seeking the exercise of discretion outside the Rules.  Both
    the writer and the reader would have understood from the terms  of  the
    passage headed "Tier 2 (General)" that the appellant  did  not  satisfy
    the requirements of paragraph 245HD(d) or (f) or Appendix A77E(a)(i) of
    the Rules.  What the letter writer was seeking to do  was  to  persuade
    the reader that if the appellant had had a Tier 2 visa or  work  permit
    she would have satisfied the requirements of Appendix  A77E(e)(ii)  and
    (iii)  and  by  so  doing  persuade  the  decision-maker  to   exercise
    discretion.

14.  We conclude therefore that on the understanding of  practice  hitherto,
    the appellant had the legitimate and reasonable  expectation  that  her
    application would be treated as  one  which  invited  the  exercise  of
    discretion  outside  the  Rules  and  that  the  decision-maker   would
    understand that he or she was being invited to do so.  The  absence  of
    any reference to the exercise of  such  a  discretion  and  so  to  the
    inevitable inference that the question was not addressed means that the
    decision was not in accordance with the law.   We  have  explained  our
    reasons for arriving at that conclusion before we have set out how  the
    issue was dealt with in the First-tier Tribunal for the  simple  reason
    that it was not dealt with at all.  We  have  been  shown  Mr  Seddon's
    skeleton  argument  presented  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  which  in
    paragraph 34 makes it clear that the submissions he was  making  to  us
    were also being made to the First-tier Tribunal.  This was  a  case  in
    which there were many issues, some of which were decided in  favour  of
    the appellant and it is no criticism of Judge Dearden to  say  that  he
    may not have fully appreciated with the clarity with which it is  being
    presented to us what the point  that  is  now  determinative  was.   He
    appears to have treated it as if it were an appeal founded on Article 8
    ECHR.  That is the second round of challenge to his decision.   We  can
    deal  with  this  rapidly  and  in  a  manner  that  we  anticipate  is
    uncontroversial.

15.  Mr Seddon submits that the appellant's private life  was  "engaged"  in
    the portmanteau word.  So indeed it was, but on the facts of this  case
    viewed from the point of view of her own private life,  it  go  nowhere
    near a viable Article 8 claim, that is to say a viable claim  that  the
    decision should be set aside as unlawful  because  it  failed  to  show
    proper respect for her right to family life.  The Secretary of State in
    a policy set out in the Immigration Rules approved by  Parliament  has,
    as Judge Dearden observed set the parameters for most  cases  in  which
    Article 8 is in issue.  It is quite unnecessary for us  to  enter  into
    the currently active debate about whether or not that  has  been  fully
    achieved.  All it is necessary for us to observe is that which we  have
    done  that  as  a  freestanding  Article  8  claim  based  on  her  own
    circumstances this gets nowhere near to providing her with a ground  of
    appeal which could not properly have been rejected.

16.  Mr Seddon puts it on a yet further and alternative basis  that  because
    the inmates of the care home in which she  works  have  formed  such  a
    close relationship with her that their private life would be engaged by
    a decision to take her away from them,  their  Article  8  rights  come
    into play.  This in our judgment is  an  exorbitant  expansion  of  the
    principle established in relation to close family  members  Beoku-Betts
    [2008] UKHL 39 and we decline to make that extension.

17.  This is one of the rare cases in which we  consider  it  necessary  not
    merely to allow the appeal but to issue a direction to the Secretary of
    State.  We do so not to make her task more difficult but to  focus  the
    mind of her officials on exactly what is required on the facts of  this
    case.  We direct that UKBA considers within  such  reasonable  time  as
    will be proposed to us the application of the appellant  for  leave  to
    remain outside  the  Rules.   That  is  the  only  decision  which  the
    Secretary of State is required to re-take.




Signed                                  Date

Mr Justice Mitting
