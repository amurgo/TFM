                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Boyd  promulgated  8.1.15,  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State, dated
    16.9.14, to refuse his application made on 17.7.14 for an EEA Residence
    Card as confirmation of a right to reside in the UK,  pursuant  to  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.  The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    18.12.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Brunnen  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    26.2.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 11.5.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out below I find that there was such error  of  law
    in the making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
    determination of Judge Boyd should be set aside and remade.

 5. Judge Boyd, deciding the appeal on the papers, was in error at  �12  to
    consider  that  evidence  postdating  the  date  of  decision  was  not
    admissible. The additional evidence adduced by the  claimant,  payslips
    suggesting that his EEA sponsor had new employment were admissible. The
    judge had to decide at the date of the hearing whether the claimant met
    the requirements of the Regulations.

 6. After sequentially eliminating other ways in which the EEA sponsor  may
    have  met  the  requirements  of  a  qualified  person  as  defined  in
    regulation 6, Judge Boyd concluded at �17, for the reasons set  out  at
    �16, that the sponsor met the requirements of regulation 6(1)(e)  as  a
    student. However, the judge neglected to  consider  the  definition  of
    student in regulation 4(1)(d), which  requires  that  the  student  has
    comprehensive sickness insurance cover  in  the  UK,  and  assures  the
    Secretary of State, by means of a declaration, or  by  such  equivalent
    means as the person may choose, that he has sufficient resources not to
    become a burden on the social assistance system of the  UK  during  his
    period of residence.

 7. At the time of the hearing before Judge Boyd, the claimant did not have
    comprehensive sickness insurance. Neither  had  he  made  the  required
    declaration. At �14 of the decision the judge found that there  was  no
    comprehensive sickness insurance cover. Further, at  the  time  of  the
    hearing there appears, from the information  set  out  at  �12  of  the
    decision, to have been insufficient information to demonstrate that the
    claimant and sponsor's income at least matched the then current  income
    support level.  It  follows  that  the  application  could  never  have
    succeeded. Regardless of the declaration and issues as to  income,  the
    complete absence of health insurance was fatal to the application.  The
    appeal was doomed from the outset and it should have been dismissed  in
    the First-tier Tribunal.

 8. Having set the decision of the First-tier Tribunal aside,  I  proceeded
    immediately to remake the decision in the appeal. I heard evidence  and
    submissions from both the claimant and his EEA sponsor, as well as  the
    submission of Ms Sage. The claimant first relied on a  EHIC  Card,  but
    Ahmad v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 988 makes it clear that an entitlement  to
    free NHS treatment does not satisfy the requirement.

 9. The claimant then produced a new insurance policy: WPA Flexible  Health
    Premier, cover commencing just a few days ago on  1.5.15.  However,  on
    examination it  is  clear  that  this  is  not  comprehensive  sickness
    insurance in that it contained an excess clause and meets only  75%  of
    any claim,  described  as  "shared  responsibility."  Neither  has  the
    claimant made any declaration. He relied on  the  same  pay  slips  put
    before the First-tier Tribunal as post-decision evidence, but there has
    been no appeal against the First-tier Tribunal finding that  they  were
    entirely inadequate to demonstrate that the EEA sponsor is a worker.

10. It follows that the appeal must be dismissed. The sponsor does not meet
    the requirements of the regulations  as  a  worker  or  self-sufficient
    person, for the reasons set out in the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision.
    Neither can she meet the requirements for a student,  for  the  reasons
    set out above. It may be that with a fresh application the claimant and
    the sponsor can marshal sufficiently  cogent  evidence  to  demonstrate
    that it can be demonstrated that she is a qualified  person  under  the
    regulations. As matters stand at the  present  time,  the  evidence  is
    woefully inadequate.

11. No Article 8 private and family life issue was  raised  in  submissions
    before me. In any event, there is no removal decision. The claimant was
    advised in the refusal decision that if he wanted to claim a  right  to
    reside on that basis he must make a separate chargeable application. As
    there is no removal decision, a discussion as to whether  such  removal
    would be disproportionate is premature. As and when a removal  decision
    is  considered,  the  claimant  will  have  the  opportunity  to   make
    representations.

Conclusions:

12. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
