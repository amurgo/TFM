               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Vassiliou
For the Respondent:    Mr Young, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The issue in this case is whether the judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
    erred in concluding that there were no insurmountable  obstacles  to  a
    British citizen partner of an Iranian national living with him in  Iran
    where the parties could not otherwise  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules in force after 9 July 2012.

 2. The appellant was born in Iran on 19 October 1987 and on  17  September
    2009 entered the United Kingdom illegally claiming asylum the same day.
     His appeal was dismissed by an Immigration Judge  of  the  Asylum  and
    Immigration Tribunal for reasons given in her  determination  dated  14
    December 2009.  In essence she did not believe  the  appellant's  claim
    which was based on a fear of harm from  adverse  interest  in  him  for
    political activities.

 3. On 3 July 2012 the appellant lodged an application for leave to  remain
    on Article 8 grounds based on his family life with Samantha McNolty,  a
    British citizen.  The respondent refused the  application  for  reasons
    given in her decision dated 12 June 2013.  That refusal was in  respect
    of the new Immigration Rules and Article 8.  In essence  the  Secretary
    of State considered that there were no insurmountable obstacles to  the
    relationship continuing in Iran.

 4. The appellant and his partner gave evidence before First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Farrelly.  He heard  evidence  that  the  appellant  had  met  Ms
    McNolty in early 2011 and they began cohabiting in  her  house  at  the
    Bridge  of  Don,  Aberdeen  that  summer.   Ms  McNolty's  family   are
    supportive of the relationship.  The appellant was baptised a Christian
    in March 2012 at the  Church  of  Scotland  in  Aberdeen.   Ms  McNolty
    explained that she could speak a little Farsi which she had learnt from
    Iranians in her home area.  She could not move to Iran because  she  is
    close to her own family who live nearby.  She is a Christian and is not
    experienced in the social mores in Iran.

 5. The judge also heard evidence from Ms McNolty's mother and her  partner
    who spoke about their support for the relationship.  He also had before
    him numerous other testimonials from  friends  including  an  offer  of
    employment of Mr Heydari.  The grounds  of  challenge  to  the  judge's
    decision which was that the Secretary of  State's  decision  would  not
    breach Article 8 can be summarised as follows:

    (i)  In considering the practical difficulties of relocation the  judge
         had made a number of errors based on insurmountable obstacles being
         clearly stated to concern the practical difficulties of  relocation
         with reference to the decision of the Tribunal in Gulshan  (Article
         8 - new rules - correct approach) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC).

    (ii) The finding that Ms McNolty should adopt Islamic customs in  order
         to enjoy her family life in Iran was unreasonable and the judge had
         failed to give sufficient weight to the practical difficulties  for
         a white Christian British female in conforming to the standards  of
         behaviour required in an Islamic state.

    (iii)    The judge failed to give sufficient weight  to  evidence  from
         the Foreign and Commonwealth  Office  regarding  travel  advice  to
         British citizens in respect of Iran dated 17 February 2014.

    (iv) The judge had expressly  acknowledged  that  there  are  practical
         difficulties for family life continuing in Iran and  had  erred  by
         failing to apply the law to his findings of fact.

    (v)  The judge had failed to  consider  the  Article  8  rights  of  Ms
         McNolty in his assessment that she should conform to  standards  of
         behaviour expected in Iran as unreasonable and an interference with
         her private life.

 6. Mr Vassiliou helpfully took me through Appendix FM in its form in force
    at the time the Secretary of State reached her decision.  In particular
    he explained how section EX operated in the particular circumstances of
    this case which aside from suitability requirements which  are  not  in
    issue, refers to eligibility requirements at E-LTRP.1.2 to  E-LTRP.1.12
    if -

         "The applicant has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with  a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British citizen, settled  in  the
         UK or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection,  and
         there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner
         continuing outside the UK".

    Mr Young accepted that this was a correct approach under the  Rules  in
    the light of the absence of any assertions of unsuitability.

 7. Dealing with the first ground of challenge, at paragraph 24 of  Gulshan
    ( Article 8-new Rules-correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640,  Cranston  J
    expressed his conclusion on the current state of the authorities and in
    particular as to what is to be understood by insurmountable obstacles:

         "(c) The term 'insurmountable  obstacles'  in  provisions  such  as
             Section  EX.1  are  not  obstacles  which  are  impossible  to
             surmount:   MF   (Nigeria);   they   concern   the   practical
             possibilities  of  relocation.   In  the   absence   of   such
             insurmountable obstacles, if removal is to be disproportionate
             it is necessary to  show  other  non-standard  and  particular
             features demonstrating  that  removal  will  be  unjustifiably
             harsh: Nagre. "

 8. Mr Vassiliou also referred me to  the  Secretary  of  State's  guidance
    which is set out in paragraph 13 of Gulshan.  It is prï¿½cised and quoted
    as follows:

         "'Insurmountable obstacles' are dealt with in paragraph 3.2.7(c) of
         the Guidance.  This states that the decision-maker should  consider
         the seriousness of the difficulties which the applicant  and  their
         partner would face in continuing  their  family  life  outside  the
         United Kingdom, and whether they entail something  that  could  not
         (or could not be expected to) be overcome, even with  a  degree  of
         hardship for one or more of the individuals concerned.  It is  said
         to be a different and more stringent  assessment  than  whether  it
         would be 'reasonable to expect' the  applicant's  partner  to  join
         them overseas.  For example, a  British  citizen  partner  who  has
         lived in the UK all their life and speaks only English may not wish
         to  uproot  and  relocate  halfway  across  the  world,  '  but   a
         significant degree of hardship or inconvenience does not amount  to
         an insurmountable obstacle'.  The decision maker is advised to look
         at whether there is an inability to live in the country  concerned.
         The focus should also be on the family life which would be  enjoyed
         in the country to which the applicant  would  be  returned,  not  a
         comparison to the life they would enjoy were they to  remain  here.
         As to cultural barriers, the guidance explains that these might  be
         relevant in situations where the partner would be so  disadvantaged
         that they could not be expected to live in that country.  'It  must
         be a barrier which either cannot be overcome  or  would  present  a
         very high degree of hardship to the partner such that it amounts to
         an insurmountable obstacle'."

 9. Thus the question is not the practical difficulties of  relocation  but
    the practical possibilities of relocation as observed by Cranston J  in
    the context of the guidance.  The judge directed himself in  connection
    with Gulshan which was relied on by Mr  Vassiliou  and  quoted  in  his
    determination at paragraph 41 of Nagre as well  as  the  above  extract
    from paragraph 24 of Gulshan.  I am satisfied that the judge  correctly
    understood the test which he was required to apply to the facts of  the
    case on which he reached the following findings:

    (i)  The appellant had entered  the  United  Kingdom  unlawfully.   His
         asylum claim had been rejected on credibility  grounds  and  he  is
         appeals rights exhausted.

    (ii) He and Ms McNolty had entered into the relationship  in  the  full
         knowledge of his precarious status.

    (iii)    Ms McNolty is a British citizen and it was accepted  that  she
         had close family ties in Scotland but was  leading  an  independent
         life.

    (iv) There was a genuine bond between the  appellant  and  Ms  McNolty.
         They have no children.  They have indicated the wish to  marry  and
         to start family when circumstances permit then.

    (v)  Ms  McNolty  appeared  not  to  have  seriously  contemplated  the
         possibility of joining her partner in Iran.

10. The judge went on to consider that possibility of  Ms  McNolty  joining
    appellant in Iran and observed that life there would be very  different
    from what she is used to.  He noted the most apparent feature  was  the
    influence of Islam and the application of religious rules  and  custom.
    He also noted significant differences in  relation  to  the  status  of
    women in Iran from  women  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  reached  this
    conclusion at [25]:

         "She could conform to the standards of behaviour expected in  Iran.
         Although Islam dominates, Christianity is tolerated.  I do not  see
         particular features indicating religion is  a  particularly  strong
         issue for her or that she has any wish to proselytise.  She has the
         advantage of knowing some Farsi which would help transition to life
         in Iran."

11. This leads to the second ground which argues that these conclusions are
    unreasonable and that there was a practical difficulty associated  with
    relocation of family to Iran.  That is not the correct test as  I  have
    observed  above.   The  judge  appears  to  have  been  aware  of   the
    differences and thus  potential  difficulties  that  Ms  McNolty  would
    encounter but I do not accept that his conclusion  on  that  she  could
    adapt to life there were not properly open to him.

12. The next ground  of  challenge  relates  to  the  dangers  for  British
    citizens associated with travel to Iran.  The only country  information
    before the judge was the report I  have  referred  to  above  from  the
    Foreign and Commonwealth Office.  That states that  British  travellers
    to Iran face greater risks than nationals of many other  countries  due
    to high levels of suspicion  about  the  UK  and  the  UK  government's
    limited ability to assist in any difficulty.  The  risk  identified  is
    that British nationals could be arbitrarily detained  in  Iran  despite
    their complete innocence and there is reference to incidents  in  2010,
    2011 and of a risk of this re-occurring.  There is also reference to  a
    group of eight Slovak paragliders having been arrested in May 2013  and
    three US hitchhikers arrested near the Iraqi border in 2009.

13. I am satisfied that the judge gave adequate  reason  for  finding  that
    notwithstanding this advice it was nevertheless open to Ms  McNolty  to
    live in Iran.  His reasons it  has  to  be  said  are  brief  but  were
    properly open to him.   She would not be a tourist but the  partner  of
    an Iranian national and living with him.

14. The next ground I consider to be misconceived as it  raises  again  the
    issue of practical difficulties.  Mr Vassiliou has  not  addressed  the
    relatively  demanding  requirement  of  the   rule   with   regard   to
    insurmountable obstacles, having regard  to  the  authorities  on  this
    aspect.  A feature of this case is that the judge observed at [9]  that
    Mr Vassiliou had confirmed the appeal solely related to Article 8.  His
    contention before me is that he addressed the judge on the Rules, hence
    the judge's approach.  I do not think anything material turns on  this.
    The judge quite correctly approached  the  circumstances  of  the  case
    through the Rules and reached a conclusion on insurmountable  obstacles
    which, had it been favourable to the appellant would have  resulted  in
    the appeal being allowed under the Rules.

15. The final ground of challenge relates to Article  8.  It  is  submitted
    again that the expectation Ms McNolty should conform to  the  standards
    of behaviour expected  in  Iran  is  unreasonable  and  constitutes  an
    interference with her private life.  I do not consider this ground  has
    any merit.  The judge addressed the  possibilities  of  relocation  and
    concluded that it was reasonable for Ms McNolty to  adapt  to  life  in
    Iran; he did so without error.

16. For these reasons the appeal is dismissed.
