Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms C Mackenzie of Counsel instructed by Dillex
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against  a  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Cassel promulgated on 5 October 2016 in which he allowed the appeal  of
    Ms Makka Mohammed Ahmed against a decision of the  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department to remove her from the United Kingdom.

2.   Although before us the Secretary of  State  is  the  appellant  and  Ms
    Ahmed  is  the  respondent,  for  the  sake  of  consistency  with  the
    proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal we shall hereafter refer  to
    the Secretary of State as the Respondent and Ms Ahmed as the Appellant.



3.   The case comes before us pursuant to permission to  appeal  granted  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Andrew  on  3  November  2016.   In  granting
    permission to appeal Judge Andrew identified that it was arguable  that
    the decision of Judge Cassel was in error:

         (i) because of  an  inadequacy  of  reasoning  in  respect  of  the
         Appellant's partner's medical condition  and  the  availability  or
         otherwise of treatment in Somalia; and


         (ii) in that it was arguable that the Judge had not  identified  on
         what basis the case could be characterised as an exceptional one to
         justify it being considered outside the Immigration Rules.

4.   The Appellant is a citizen of Somalia, born on 8 September  1965.   She
    left Somalia in or about 1995 and lived  in  Kenya  with  her  daughter
    (born on 25 August 1994) until 2007.  In the meantime her  husband,  Mr
    Fauz Mohammed Abdalla, born in 1960, and their two  sons  came  to  the
    United Kingdom and Mr Abdalla claimed asylum.   He  was  successful  in
    this regard, and Mr Abdalla and the two (now adult) sons are  presently
    British citizens who have been living in the United Kingdom for some 21
    years.

5.   In 2007 the Appellant and her daughter were granted entry clearance  to
    join her husband in the United  Kingdom,  with  leave  for  two  years.
    Unfortunately, upon the expiry of that leave in 2009,  no  applications
    were made for further leave to remain.  It was not until 2013 that  the
    Appellant and  her  daughter  sought  to  regularise  their  respective
    immigration  positions.   Each  made  application  for   asylum.    The
    applications  were  considered  separately  and  in  due   course   the
    Appellant's  daughter  was  granted  asylum  on  15  April  2014.   The
    Appellant, however, was refused: in a decision dated 6 March  2015  the
    Respondent not only refused the asylum  claim  but,  having  considered
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules, also  found  that  there  was  no
    basis to stay  provided  by  her  family  and  private  life.   Removal
    directions were issued accordingly.

6.    In  respect  of  the  Appellant's  relationship  to  her  husband  the
    Respondent's 'reasons for refusal' letter ('RFRL'), having set out  the
    relevant passages from Appendix FM in respect of leave to remain  as  a
    partner under Section E-LTRP, went on to  consider  paragraph  EX.1  of
    Appendix FM.  It is not explicit on  the  face  of  the  RFRL  why  the
    Respondent went directly to a consideration of EX.1, but during helpful
    discussion today it appears to be  common  ground  that  it  was  as  a
    consequence of the Appellant failing  to  satisfy  the  requirement  of
    paragraph E-LTRP2.2  -  that  is  to  say  that  at  the  time  of  her
    application she was present in the UK in breach of immigration laws.

7.   As regards paragraph EX.1, the Respondent determined  that  there  were
    not obstacles to the Appellant returning  that  could  be  said  to  be
    insurmountable, and that she would be able to continue her family  life
    with her partner in Somalia.

8.   The Appellant appealed to the IAC.

9.   The case was first considered by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Dean,  who
    dismissed the appeal on asylum and human rights grounds in  a  decision
    promulgated on 23 September 2015.  In respect of the asylum claim Judge
    Dean found that the Appellant was not entitled  to  protection  on  the
    basis of her clan membership, essentially following  and  applying  the
    decision of MOJ and others (Return to Mogadishu)  (Somalia)  CG  [2014]
    UKUT 00443.  As regards the possibility that the Appellant would be  at
    risk as a single vulnerable female, at paragraph  22  of  his  decision
    Judge Dean concluded that she would not be returned as a lone woman and
    in that regard reference was made at paragraph 21  to  the  Appellant's
    husband - although he was a  British  citizen  it  was  said  that  "no
    evidence has been submitted to demonstrate  to  the  required  standard
    that he cannot travel to  Somalia  to  assist  his  wife  to  establish
    herself in Mogadishu".

10.  The decision of Judge Dean was the subject of  challenge  and  pursuant
    to permission to appeal granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Deans  on  26
    October 2015 came before Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge  Mandalia.   Judge
    Mandalia upheld First-tier Tribunal Judge Dean's decision in respect of
    the asylum issue but determined that there had been a material error of
    law in respect of consideration of Article  8.   In  consequence  Judge
    Mandalia decided that the appeal should be remitted to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  The 'Notice of Decision' at paragraph 31 of Judge Mandalia's
    remittal is in these terms:

         "The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of  an
         error of law such that it is set aside.  The appeal is  allowed  to
         the extent that  the  appeal  on  Article  8  grounds  outwith  the
         Immigration Rules is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal."

11.  It was in such circumstances that the matter came before Judge  Cassel.



12.  Before going on to look further at  the  details  of  the  decision  of
    Judge Cassel we emphasise the basis upon which the appeal was remitted.
     We do so because it seems to us that it provides a substantial if  not
    complete answer to the second ground raised by the  Respondent  in  her
    challenge before us.  The Respondent's second ground complains that the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge had materially erred in law in  that  he  had
    failed to show that this case was exceptional to justify  consideration
    of Article 8 outwith the Immigration Rules.  However, as  may  be  seen
    from the passage quoted above from the decision of Judge Mandalia,  the
    appeal had been remitted  precisely  for  the  purpose  of  considering
    Article 8 outwith the Rules.  The premise of the remittal was that this
    was indeed an exceptional case that  required  to  be  considered  with
    reference to Article 8 outside the Rules.  That is emphasised,  in  our
    judgment, by the undisturbed finding of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Dean
    at paragraph 30 of his decision which is in the following terms:

         "I recognise that the facts of this case insofar as they relate  to
         family life are somewhat unusual in that this is a situation  where
         there is, in effect, a family reunion and this is not  specifically
         addressed by Appendix FM of the  Immigration  Rules.   I  therefore
         find that the Appellant's case is one where it  is  appropriate  to
         consider the Appellant's family life under Article  8  outside  the
         Rules."


13.  Nonetheless in this context Mr Bramble has today  drawn  our  attention
    to the case of The Queen (on the application of) Sunassee  [2015]  EWHC
    1604 (Admin), and in particular at  paragraph  36  in  respect  of  the
    guidance given in the case  of  SS  (Congo)  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387  on
    consideration of Article 8 issues outside the  Immigration  Rules.   It
    seems to us that the assistance to be  gained  from  that  case  whilst
    broadly uncontroversial does not really progress the matter any further
    than the parameters set in the terms of the remittal of Judge Mandalia.



14.  Mr Bramble has emphasised in the course of submissions that there  does
    not appear to be any reference to the Immigration Rules in the decision
    of Judge Cassel, but it seems  to  us  that  given  the  terms  of  the
    remittal that is not in itself surprising.  In any event it seems to us
    that on the substance of the consideration given by Judge Cassel to the
    facts of the Appellant's case - and  in  particular  comments  made  at
    paragraphs 23 and 24  -  the  Judge  clearly  considered  this  was  an
    exceptional case.

15.  In this regard the Judge cited the case of Huang v Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2007] UKHL 11 and  noted  that  the  House  of
    Lords have "expressed the view that it was still the  expectation  that
    the number of claimants not covered  by  the  Rules  and  supplementary
    directions entitled to succeed under Article 8 would be  a  very  small
    minority" (see Judge Cassel at paragraph 23). Then,  at  paragraph  24,
    Judge Cassel went on to state that in his opinion this was a case  that
    was "one of the rare cases envisaged in Huang".  It seems  to  us  that
    that makes it absolutely plain that Judge Cassel considered  that  this
    was an exceptional case worthy of consideration by reference to Article
    8 outside the Immigration Rules.

16.  Moreover it is also to be noted,  further  to  the  references  to  the
    Respondent's RFRL above, that the basis upon which the Appellant failed
    to satisfy the Rules was in the  first  instance  in  relation  to  her
    status - which is clearly a matter to which Judge Cassel had  regard  -
    and secondly in relation to  obstacles  to  family  life.   The  second
    matter, obstacles to family life, was the express subject and focus  of
    the consideration of Judge Cassel in his decision.

17.  Accordingly, with reference both to the premise  of  the  remittal  and
    the substance of Judge Cassel's decision,  we  find  no  merit  in  the
    Respondent's second ground of challenge.

18.  The focus is therefore on the Respondent's ground that the  Judge  gave
    inadequate reasons in respect  of  the  Appellant's  partner's  medical
    circumstances and the availability of treatment for him in Somalia.

19.  We note in  the  premises  that  Judge  Cassel  appropriately  directed
    himself to both Article 8(1) and 8(2) of the ECHR at  paragraph  15  of
    his decision, and also had  regard  to  the  public  interest  concerns
    pursuant to section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002, which he recited at paragraph 16.  It also seems to us that  this
    was no mere simple recital but that the Judge went on to consider those
    public interest requirements in the body of the decision - for  example
    section 117B(1)  and  (5)  are  both  given  express  consideration  at
    paragraph 17, and the substance of section 117B(3) was given particular
    consideration at paragraph 19.

20.  The Judge set out findings of  fact  at  paragraph  14.   These  are  a
    matter of record and we do not propose to repeat them all here  but  we
    emphasise the following matters:

         (i) At paragraph 14(v) the Judge found that

         "The five members of the family lived together  and  the  remaining
         four have lived together since 2007.  The Appellant,  her  husband,
         one of their sons and their  daughter  continue  to  live  together
         until the date of today's hearing.  Their oldest son  has  married,
         has a child of 3 months and lives close to  the  remaining  family.
         They remain in regular contact."


         (ii) At 14(vi) the Judge refers to the grant of refugee  status  to
         the Appellant's daughter.


         (iii) At 14(vii) the Judge states this:


         "The Appellant speaks Swahili, the language of  her  home  city  in
         Somalia and  in  Kenya.   She  does  not  speak,  and  has  limited
         understanding of  Somali  which  is  the  predominant  language  in
         Mogadishu.   Mr  Abdalla  also  speaks  Swahili  and   has   little
         comprehension of Somali."


         (iv) At paragraph 14(viii) the Judge stated:


         "The only work the Appellant has undertaken is  cooking,  when  she
         was in the Libor refugee camp.  She was able to cook quantities  of
         food in either 5 or 10 Kg batches, some of which she sold to  other
         residents in the refugee camp.  The residents had limited means and
         she made little money from this enterprise.   She  has  taught  the
         Koran as a volunteer in both Kenya and in England.  She receives no
         money for this.  She has looked after the members of her family and
         in the recent past, with the health of  her  husband  failing,  has
         spent increasing time looking after him."


         (v) The circumstances of the Appellant's husband were considered at
         paragraph 14(ix) (typed as 14(viiii)):

         "Mr Abdalla has no wish to return to Somalia from where he fled  20
         years ago as a refugee.  He has worked as a  storeman  for  Harrods
         for  15  years.   He  has  diabetes,  high  blood   pressure,   and
         hypertension and suffers from chest pains.  At the request  of  his
         GP he goes every week for a check-up and is prescribed a  range  of
         prescription only medicines.   At  work,  because  of  his  medical
         conditions, adjustments have been made for him to be able to  work.
         He is allowed to take regular rest breaks and is allowed to go home
         when he feels unwell.  He has long-term and serious health problems
         which his employer recognises as in need of adjustments and  it  is
         likely they consider him to be a disabled person.   The  healthcare
         that he needs is unlikely to be made available to  him  in  Somalia
         and in any event if he returned to Somalia he could not resume work
         as a tailor because of his health problems and it is unlikely  that
         he would find gainful employment.  He earns �1,300 net  per  month,
         the family live in rented accommodation for which he pays �500  per
         month rent and in addition approximately �100 in Council  tax.   He
         has little spare money and would have no financial  flexibility  to
         send money to the Appellant, should she live in Mogadishu."


21.  The Judge took these findings of fact forward to his  consideration  of
    the five Razgar questions at paragraphs 18-22.  In  respect  of  family
    life, the Judge having identified that this was  indeed  a  case  about
    family life rather than the private life of the Appellant, stated  this
    at paragraph 18:

         "I have no doubt that this is a very stable  family  and  that  the
         four members living together lead a close family life.   They  have
         lived together in the UK for 9 years.  The Appellant's  husband  is
         dependent on the Appellant to a considerable degree.   He  is  very
         likely a disabled person under the provisions of the  Equality  Act
         2010.  His employers have made adjustments to his work place duties
         and he has to visit his GP on a weekly basis to  monitor  his  long
         term and substantial ailments.  In the  American  State  Department
         Report, submitted by the Appellant, at section 7(d) it is  apparent
         that people with disabilities receive little  protection  from  the
         state in Somalia.  It is wholly unrealistic for the  Respondent  to
         maintain that if he returned to Somalia with the Appellant that  he
         could continue his trade as a tailor."


22.   At  paragraph  19  the  Judge  refers  to  the  circumstances  of  the
    Appellant's sons, and then at paragraph 20 says this in respect of  the
    daughter:

         "Their daughter has been granted leave to remain in  the  UK  as  a
         refugee.  She has submitted a letter of support at page 82  of  the
         Appellant's bundle.  Although she is  an  adult  all  the  evidence
         points to her having spent her entire life with her mother,  either
         in Somalia, the refugee camp in Kenya and in the UK."


23.  At paragraph 21 the Judge considers and finds that he accepts that  the
    Appellant has no family left in Somalia and has been dependent  on  her
    husband throughout, and  then  says  that  "if  she  were  returned  to
    Somalia, she would return on her  own.   Her  family  are  entitled  to
    remain in the UK and have no apparent desire to return to Somalia".  We
    note that the premise of the asylum claim being refused was at least on
    one basis on the assumption that the Appellant would have  the  company
    of her husband in returning to Somalia.  It seems to us  that  this  is
    indeed why the case focused  upon  the  ability  of  the  Appellant  to
    establish a family life with her husband in Somalia, and whether or not
    there are obstacles to that.

24.  Judge Cassel concludes in these terms at paragraph 22:

         "For all these reasons, I find it is not reasonable to  expect  the
         Appellant to return to Somalia and accept that  her  removal  would
         interfere with her right to respect for her  family  life  of  such
         gravity as to  potentially  engage  Article  8.   Of  course,  such
         interference would be in accordance with  the  law  in  maintaining
         immigration control."


    This is essentially to answer the first four Razgar  questions  in  the
    Appellant's favour, and it is apparent that the Judge then goes  on  at
    paragraphs 23 and 24 with reference to Huang as cited above to conclude
    that the proportionality balance favoured the Appellant.

25.  The Respondent's challenge has focused on one element in particular  of
    that overall evaluation, and that is in  relation  to  the  Appellant's
    husband's health.   Mr  Bramble  has  directed  our  attention  to  the
    passages  in  each  of  the  Appellant's  and  her  husband's   witness
    statements in which reference is made to his health and has  then  gone
    on to emphasise that in terms of supporting medical evidence  the  only
    document before the First-tier Tribunal Judge was a prescription script
    to be found at pages 27 and 28 of the Appellant's bundle.

26.  Mr Bramble has also directed  attention  to  the  US  State  Department
    Report cited by the Judge at paragraph 18.  This is to be found at page
    67 of the Appellant's First-tier Tribunal bundle.  The relevant passage
    identified  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  is  in  relation   to
    discrimination in the context of employment or occupation.   Whilst  it
    seems to us that the Judge has accurately reflected  the  substance  of
    the  US  State  Department  Report  at  paragraph  18,  it  is  to   be
    acknowledged that  nothing  in  that  report  expressly  addresses  the
    question of the availability of medical treatment.  Indeed  it  is  the
    absence of any such evidence in this regard that gives us any cause for
    concern at all in what is otherwise  a  carefully-worded  and  thorough
    consideration of the facts and issues in this appeal.

27.  In our judgment it was open to the Judge on the basis  of  the  witness
    statements, the oral evidence heard at the appeal, and the prescription
    script to come to the  conclusion  that  the  Appellant's  husband  did
    indeed have the ailments claimed.  It seems to us it was also  open  to
    the Judge to infer from the evidence given as to the  adjustments  made
    at the place of employment that the  Appellant  was  somebody  who  was
    considered  by  his  employer  to  be   under   a   disability.    This
    'classification' by the employer of itself is not necessarily material,
    but it does seem to us fittingly to inform an overall assessment of the
    medical circumstances of the Appellant's husband.

28.  However, as regards the Judge's observation at  paragraph  14(ix)  that
    the healthcare that he needs is "unlikely to be made available  to  him
    in Somalia", Ms Mackenzie very properly acknowledged that there was  no
    supporting evidence directly on this point.

29.  We have reached the conclusion that ultimately this makes  no  material
    difference to the outcome in this appeal.  We note in  particular  that
    the Appellant and her husband would be returning to an area of  Somalia
    in which they  do  not  speak  the  local  language.   The  Judge  made
    sustainable findings that the Appellant's husband would be unlikely  to
    find employment and had no savings to speak of.  Whilst again there  is
    no direct evidence on  point  in  this  regard,  there  is  no  serious
    contention between  the  parties  before  us  that  there  is  anything
    approaching a free medical service available to persons  in  Somalia  -
    and therefore it follows that even if  suitable  medical  treatment  is
    available it is more likely than not that if the Appellant's husband is
    to access medical treatment it would have  to  be  done  on  a  private
    basis.  Given that the findings of the Judge were to  the  effect  that
    this would be a couple without means and without the ability to  access
    employment, over and above the fact that they would be in an area where
    they do not speak the local language, it seems to us  that  on  balance
    they would indeed find themselves in a situation where the  Appellant's
    husband could not easily  maintain  the  treatment  that  he  has  been
    receiving as a British citizen in the United Kingdom.

30.  To that  extent  it  seems  to  us  that  the  absence  of  any  direct
    supporting  evidence  on  medical  facilities  in  Somalia   does   not
    constitute a matter such that the reasoning of the Judge can be said to
    be unsustainable or a material error of law.  In those circumstances we
    reject both aspects of the Secretary  of  State's  challenge  and  find
    there to be no error of law.
