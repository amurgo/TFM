Representation:
Appellant   Ms Hussain (Legal Representative)
Respondent  Mr Mills (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I do not make  an  anonymity  order  under  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended).

 2. The appellant is a national of Kenya. On October 8, 2014 the  appellant
    claimed asylum and the respondent refused his application in a decision
    dated January 30, 2015.

 3. The appellant appealed that decision on February 11, 2015 under Section
    82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  and  the
    appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Cooper (hereinafter
    referred to as "the Judge" on July 16, 2015. In a decision  promulgated
    on August 3, 2015 the Judge found she had no jurisdiction to  hear  the
    appeal because there was a certification under  section  94(3)  of  the
    2002 Act.

 4. The appellant appealed the Judge's decision  on  August  17,  2015  and
    permission to appeal was refused by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Simpson on September 18, 2015. Permission to  appeal  was  renewed  and
    permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Pitt on October 20, 2015
    who found there was an arguable error in law on the basis the Judge had
    not dealt with the correct decision and appeal there being  an  earlier
    decision dated  January  15,  2015  which  was  certified  whereas  the
    decision dated January 30, 2015 was not certified.

 5. The matter came before me on the above date. I had before me a Rule  24
    response from the respondent dated  November  10,  2015  in  which  the
    respondent accepted there had been an error in law.

    DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

 6. In granting permission to appeal Upper Tribunal Judge  Pitt  identified
    an arguable error of law. The  respondent  conceded  that  error  in  a
    letter dated November 10, 2015.

 7. There has been no hearing of the evidence in this case.

 8. I raised with both representatives where this appeal  should  be  heard
    and both parties agreed with me that in light of Part 3, Section 7.1 to
    7.3 of the Practice Statement the matter  should  be  remitted  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 9. I direct that any additional evidence should  be  served  on  both  the
    Tribunal and other party in  accordance  with  the  current  Procedural
    Rules.

    DECISION

10. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law. I set aside the decision.

11. The appeal is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for these issues
    to be addressed hearing under Section 12 of the Tribunals,  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007.

12. I direct that the matter be listed before any Judge of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal other than Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Cooper.


Signed:                                 Dated:
