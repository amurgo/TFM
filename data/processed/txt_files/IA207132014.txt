                                PARVIZ NABIEV
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and


                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Uzebekistan who appealed to the First-tier
    Tribunal against the decision of the Secretary  of  State  of  30  April
    2014. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeal  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 18 December 2014. Judge  Simpson  granted  the  appellant
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. By way of a letter from his solicitors to the Upper  Tribunal  dated  26
    February 2015 the appellant states that  he  wishes  his  appeal  to  be
    treated as withdrawn by the Upper Tribunal.

 3. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party  to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as  a  whole,
    and observing that the Secretary  of  State  was  the  successful  party
    before the First-tier Tribunal, I give such consent to the appellant  to
    withdraw his case.

 4. Accordingly with my consent, and pursuant to rule 17(5) of the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  this  appeal  is  recorded  as
    "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal".  This  is  a  Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform the parties that the  appellant's  case
    is withdrawn.

 5. The effect of the  appellant's  case  being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper  Tribunal  are  at  an
    end. There is no appeal before the Upper  Tribunal  and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision shall stand.


Signed                              Date:  11 March 2015
