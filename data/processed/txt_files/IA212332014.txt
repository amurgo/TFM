Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Ojo (Graceland Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr A Melvin (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  with  permission,  by  the
    Secretary of State in relation to a Decision and Reasons of the  First-
    tier Tribunal (Judge Tiffen) promulgated on 15th January 2015 by  which
    she allowed the Appellant's appeal on Article 8 grounds.

 2. For the sake of clarity and continuity I will  continue  to  refer,  in
    this determination, to Mr Dawodu as the Appellant and to the  Secretary
    of State as the Respondent.

 3. The Appellant is a national of Nigeria born  on  20th  April  1987.  He
    entered the United Kingdom in August 2012 as a Tier 4 (General) Student
    Migrant with leave until 30th January 2014. Before the expiry  of  that
    leave he made an application  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  as  a
    dependent relative of his parents who are in the UK and are naturalised
    British  citizens.  Also  in  January  2014,  the  Appellant  commenced
    studying for a Ph.D. at  the  University  of  Nottingham  funded  by  a
    scholarship provided jointly by the UK and Chinese governments.

 4. On 17th April 2014 the Secretary of State refused  the  application  to
    vary his leave and also made a decision to remove him to  Nigeria.  The
    Appellant appealed and his appeal came  before  Judge  Tiffen  on  12th
    January 2015. On  that  occasion,  as  before  me,  the  Appellant  was
    represented by Mr Ojo.  Judge  Tiffen  heard  oral  evidence  from  the
    Appellant  and  from  his  father  and  also  took  into  account   the
    Appellant's and Respondent's bundles. She heard that the Appellant  had
    started studying for his Ph.D. and  that  his  mother  had  paid  ï¿½1500
    towards accommodation. He said that he regarded his parents' address in
    Harlow as his home and that he has no home or address in Nigeria.  Both
    of his parents and his two younger siblings are  British  citizens.  On
    completion of his Ph.D. he  proposed  to  continue  working  in  energy
    technology and is particularly interested in  buildings  and  improving
    efficiency and the sustainability of buildings in the United Kingdom.

 5. The Appellant's father is a GP and his  mother  a  nurse.  One  of  his
    brothers is also studying for an MA at Nottingham  University  and  his
    younger brother has just completed his GCSEs.

 6. Judge Tiffen heard evidence that the Appellant's parents supported  him
    financially. The family are all highly educated and anticipate a bright
    future in the United Kingdom.

 7. Judge Tiffen heard that the Appellant previously lived  in  the  United
    Kingdom and attended school here between the ages of 7 and 10. In  1999
    the family returned  to  Nigeria  where  the  Appellant  completed  his
    secondary education and then studied for a degree at the University  of
    Lagos. In 2007 the Appellant's father was granted the right to work and
    live in the United Kingdom under the highly skilled  migrant  programme
    and in 2008 the Appellant's mother and younger siblings joined  him  in
    the UK. As the Appellant was at University he remained in  Nigeria.  He
    continued to be financially supported by  his  parents  and  spent  his
    vacations with them in the UK. Whilst in the  Nigeria  his  father  had
    arranged a guardian for him, a Dr Fashola. He is not a relative but  is
    a friend of his father's. He is still in Lagos.

 8. The Judge noted that the application was on  Article  8  grounds  only,
    acknowledging that the Appellant did not meet the requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules. The Judge found that the Appellant had a family life
    in the United Kingdom with his  parents  and  brother  and  sister  and
    considered that Article 8 was engaged.  She  also  found  that  he  had
    acquired a private life during his studies in the UK.  The  Judge  then
    set out various pieces of case  law  including  Ghising  (family  life-
    adults-Gurkha policy) [2012] UKUT  00160  (IAC)  which  indicated  that
    family life could  continue  between  a  parent   and  an  adult  child
    particularly when the child has not established an independent life  of
    his own. She also referred herself to the case  of  Beoku-Betts  [2008]
    UKHL 38  and Huang [2007] UKHL 11  and the recent guidance in AAO v ECO
    [2011] EWCA Civ 40 but found that  the  in  this  particular  case  the
    family had a bond which went beyond normal emotional ties. The  Judge's
    reasons for allowing the appeal are  contained  in  only  half  of  one
    paragraph [21] where the judge said:-

         "The Appellant's parents have chosen  to  come  to  United  Kingdom
         under the  highly  skilled  migrant  programme  and  as  such  have
         contributed enormously to the United Kingdom. To  deprive  them  of
         the  ability  to  provide  emotional  and  family  support  to  the
         Appellant during  his  studies  is  to  my  mind  ungracious.  This
         particular family have clearly adopted the United Kingdom as  their
         home. The Appellant's siblings are studying and will no doubt  also
         contribute to the economic wealth of this country and  have  become
         British citizens. The Appellant himself has passed the life in  the
         UK test and  has  a  strong  desire  to  live  his  life  here  and
         contribute  to  the  economic  future   of   the   United   Kingdom
         particularly in his chosen field of study".

 9. She thus allowed the appeal.

10. The Secretary  of  State  in  her  grounds  challenging  that  decision
    asserted that the Judge allow the application outside the rules without
    any  reference  whatsoever  to  section  117A   of   the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  and thus failed to consider the public
    interest when assessing proportionality. It is  further  asserted  that
    the Judge  failed to  have  regard  to  the  current  jurisprudence  in
    relation to Article 8 including Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin),  Gulshan
    (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC)  and
    MF(Nigeria)[2013] EWCA Civ 1192. The Judge failed also to consider that
    the Appellant has the opportunity to study in the UK if he wishes to by
    satisfying the requirements to achieve a student visa.

11. Before me Mr Ojo sought to defend the decision and  he  relied  on  the
    case of Dube (section 117A - 117D)  [2015]  UKUT  00090  (IAC)  and  in
    particular to paragraph 2 of the head note in which it is  stated  that
    "it is not an error of law to fail to refer  to  section  117A  -  117D
    considerations if the Judge has applied the test he or she was supposed
    to apply according to its terms; what matters is substance, not  form".
    I referred Mr Ojo to the case of AM (S117B)  Malawi  [2015]  UKUT  0260
    (IAC) which he indicated he had read.  He  nevertheless  conflated  the
    issues of "lawfulness" and "precariousness" relying on  the  fact  that
    the  Appellant  had  always  had  leave.  I  found  that  the   Judge's
    consideration of Article 8 and her reasons  for  allowing  this  appeal
    woefully inadequate and do not address any of the relevant  issues.  An
    "ungracious decision is not disproportionate. In particular  the  judge
    completely ignored section 117 A and s.117B and it cannot be said  that
    she took the principles into account albeit without mentioning it.  She
    clearly did not. At no time did the Judge consider the  fact  that  the
    private and family life that the Appellant had built up in the  UK  was
    at a time when he was here on a temporary two-year visa and thus  at  a
    time when his status was therefore precarious. I found that the Judge's
    decision was unsustainable and I set it aside in its entirety

12. Mr Ojo urged me to remit the  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I
    declined to do so because there was  no  good  reason  to  do  so.  The
    evidence was unchanged and the matter  could  proceed  on  submissions.
    Furthermore, the London hearing centre where the case was heard in  the
    First-tier Tribunal has extremely long  waiting  times  such  that  any
    appeal in the First-tier would be unlikely to be heard this year.

13. Having given Mr Ojo time to explain the  position  to  his  clients  we
    proceeded.

14. There was no necessity for the Appellant to give oral evidence  and  Mr
    Melvin had no wish to cross-examine either him or his father. The facts
    were as they were before the First-tier Tribunal and as set out in  the
    Record of Proceedings, the witness statements and the oral evidence.  I
    did clarify that the Appellant's parents' home is in Harlow in Essex.

15. In his submissions Mr Ojo said that while he was in Nigeria  completing
    his studies the Appellant spent every holiday with his  family  in  the
    United Kingdom. His family life is deeply rooted in the United  Kingdom
    and he has not embarked upon a separate independent life away from  his
    parents. In the UK every holiday  from  university  he  spends  in  the
    family home and his family ties remain firmly with his parents. He also
    submitted that if he were removed to Nigeria where he has no family  or
    property, his only home being with his parents in the UK  he  would  be
    destitute.

16. With  regard  to  exceptional  circumstances  he  said  that  case  law
    indicated that exceptional circumstances do not have to be  one  single
    event but can be a collection of circumstances and  in  this  case  the
    Appellant is in receipt of a scholarship jointly funded by the  UK  and
    Chinese governments and that money will be wasted if he is required  to
    leave the UK. Additionally he will be separated from his family,  which
    would have a very damaging effect on  him,  being  unable  to  see  his
    siblings and  his  parents.  He  argued  that  on  the  facts  of  this
    particular case, the public interest required the Appellant  to  remain
    rather than be removed.

17. In response the Home Office Presenting  Officer  indicated  that  there
    would be no possible prospect  of  the  Appellant  being  destitute  on
    return to Nigeria. He was supported by his family  previously  when  he
    was there on his own and that could continue. Additionally his guardian
    remains there to assist him. Furthermore, there is,  if  he  wishes  to
    study for a PhD in the United Kingdom, no reason why he could not  make
    such an application now.  He  is  28  years  of  age.  His  status  was
    precarious at the time he started to study  for  a  PhD  and  there  is
    nothing compelling or exceptional about the circumstances of this  case
    to render his removal disproportionate. The family  chose  to  make  an
    application for something they knew or ought to have known  they  could
    not have.

18. This is a case where the Appellant has applied for leave to  remain  in
    the  United  Kingdom  as  an  adult  dependent  relative.  That  is  an
    application which cannot succeed from within the United Kingdom even if
    he could establish dependency. He had been in the United Kingdom for  a
    period of two years only when he made his application, some 3  ï¿½  years
    now. He is now aged 28.

19. In terms of Article 8 outside the Rules, I can see nothing  unusual  or
    exceptional that justifies consideration outside the Immigration Rules.
     However, even if there were, the Appellant could not succeed  for  the
    following reasons.

20. This case is about proportionality. The Appellant has accrued a private
    life in the United Kingdom which includes  his  studies  and  also  his
    various relationships. In considering proportionality I am required  by
    section 117A of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  to
    take into account the factors contained in section 117B.

21. Section 117B provides:-

    117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all cases

    (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public
         interest.

    (2)  It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests
         of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who
         seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able to speak
         English, because persons who can speak English -

         (a)  are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

         (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

    (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of
         the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who
         seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are financially
         independent, because such persons -

         (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and

         (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

    (4) Little weight should be given to -

         (a)  a private life, or

         (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

         that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
         United Kingdom unlawfully.

    (5)  Little weight should be given to a private life established by a
         person at a time when the person's immigration status is
         precarious.

    (6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where -

         (a)  the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship
             with a qualifying child, and

         (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the
             United Kingdom.

22. The Appellant can speak English and he has been maintained in  full  by
    his parents thus far  both  of  whom  are  professionals  there  is  no
    question of him being a burden on the UK.

23. There is no doubt that this family are highly educated, intelligent and
    hard-working and no doubt an asset to the  UK  economy.  However,  that
    does not obviate the need to comply  with  UK  Immigration  Rules.  The
    Appellant's parents made a choice to leave him in Nigeria in  2008.  At
    that time he was 21 years of age and already  an  adult.  They  had  no
    qualms about leaving him to study  there  at  university.  They  had  a
    friend to whom he could turn if  needed  and  they  provided  financial
    support for him. Notwithstanding the  fact  that  he  spent  university
    holidays in the United Kingdom, the Appellant  was  essentially  living
    away from his family for a period of four years before he came  to  the
    UK. Furthermore, once he came to the United  Kingdom  he  came  on  the
    temporary student Visa and could have  had  no  legitimate  expectation
    that would allow him to remain  on  a  permanent  basis.  He  lived  in
    university  accommodation  rather  than  with  his  parents  and  again
    notwithstanding the fact that he spent holidays with them, he could not
    be said to be living with them. He  has  therefore  not  lived  in  the
    family home since 2008, a period now of seven years. He is 28 years  of
    age, highly educated, highly  intelligent  and  more  than  capable  of
    living independently. Whilst I appreciate the case law  which  suggests
    that Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ 31 should not be that followed  in  every
    case and that it is certainly  not  the  case  that  a  child  suddenly
    becomes independent of his family and can no longer be said to  have  a
    family life with them on his 18th birthday.  Cases need to be looked at
    in the round. However, looking at this case in the round the  Appellant
    has lived effectively away from his parents for some  seven  years  now
    and is indeed rapidly approaching his 30th birthday. It cannot be  said
    in this case therefore that there is any dependency over and above  the
    normal emotional ties between an adult child and his parents. The  fact
    that they are financially supporting him does not alter that.  A  great
    many parents continue to  provide  financial  support  to  their  adult
    children even though they are living away  from  home.  Accordingly,  I
    find that the  Appellant  cannot  be  said  to  enjoy  family  life  as
    protected by Article 8 with his parents and siblings. That is a  direct
    result of the family's own choices and in particular to  leave  him  in
    Nigeria in 2008 when they came to the UK.

24. So far as the Appellant's Ph.D. studies are concerned, I  do  not  find
    this to  be  a  relevant  factor  influencing  the  proportionality  of
    removal. There is no human right to study in the UK. He has  chosen  to
    embark on a  course  of  study  funded  by  our  own  and  the  Chinese
    governments at a time when his status in the UK was precarious. Indeed,
    it is rather surprising that the university permitted this. However, be
    that as it may,  it  did.  However,  the  Appellant  did  not  make  an
    application to remain in the United  Kingdom  to  pursue  his  studies,
    rather he made an application which, given that he  is  represented  he
    knew or ought to have known could not succeed. He still has the  option
    open to him to make an application to study in the UK.  That  may  well
    involve his returning to Nigeria to make the application but that  will
    amount to inconvenience rather than any hardship for the Appellant. The
    family has contacts there including his guardian who  can  assist  him.
    The suggestion by Mr Ojo that he  will  be  destitute  if  returned  is
    wholly without merit on the evidence. The family have  been  supporting
    him throughout and will continue to do so now as they have in the past.

25. The private life that the Appellant has acquired in the United  Kingdom
    has been built at a time when his status was precarious.  He  has  only
    ever had a period of limited leave of two years duration and  therefore
    little weight should be attached to that  private  life  in  accordance
    with section 117B (5).

26. While this is a family who will clearly be of benefit to the UK economy
    and the family, including the Appellant may well prove to be  an  asset
    to  this  country,  they  can  only  do  so  provided  they  meet   the
    requirements of  the  Rules.  In  this  case  they  chose  to  make  an
    application that could not succeed rather  than  an  application  as  a
    student which  could  have  done.  That  avenue  remains  open  to  the
    Appellant from Nigeria.

27. For the above reasons refusing to vary the Appellant's leave to  remain
    and removing him to  Nigeria  will  not  represent  a  disproportionate
    breach of his private and family life as protected by articulate ECHR.

28. Accordingly, the Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
    allowed with the result that the  Appellant's  appeal  original  appeal
    against the Secretary of State's decision is dismissed.
No anonymity direction is made.
