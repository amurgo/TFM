For the Appellant:     Mr A. McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms S. Chaudhri, Sponsor


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of Pakistan born 1st February 1988. On the
    21st April 2015 the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Nicol)  allowed  his
    appeal against  the  decision  to  refuse  him  entry  clearance  as  a
    'partner' under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  The  appeal  was
    allowed on human rights grounds.  The Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) now
    has permission to appeal that decision[1].

 2. The Respondent's application for entry clearance was made on  the  23rd
    November 2013. It was based on his marriage to  British  national  Saba
    Chaudhri.  Together they submitted evidence of the Sponsor's employment
    including a letter from Highfield Taxis and wage slips.

 3. There was some delay in the application being  dealt  with,  apparently
    because the ECO was awaiting the outcome of the appeal in MM  (Lebanon)
    [2014] EWCA Civ 985.  An preliminary decision was notified in June 2014
    but the final notice of decision is dated the 16th December  2014.  The
    ECO was not satisfied that the  documents  relating  to  the  Sponsor's
    employment were genuine. In  addition  the  application  had  not  been
    supported by the evidence specified in Appendix  FM-SE,  in  particular
    bank statements showing the claimed salary being deposited.  As to  the
    relationship, the ECO was not satisfied that this  was  a  genuine  and
    subsisting marriage and that the  parties  intended  to  live  together
    permanently.

 4. When the matter came before the First-tier  Tribunal  the  Judge  heard
    oral evidence from the Sponsor and had regard to the  bundles  produced
    by both parties.   Having done so he made  the  following  findings  of
    fact:

      i) The marriage is genuine;

     ii) The Sponsor is employed by AA Law Solicitors;

    iii) The Sponsor has a second job with Highfield Taxis;

     iv) Her combined income from  those  employments  is  higher  than  the
         required threshold of �18,600

    Paragraph 22 notes that in closing submissions  the  HOPO  on  the  day
    conceded that there was a subsisting relationship, and that the Sponsor
    was employed as claimed.

 5. In respect of Appendix FM-SE the determination says the following:

         "There is a technical argument that the  Sponsor's  wages  paid  in
         case by one of her employers was not paid  into  her  bank  account
         before being used on her living expenses but this does not seem  to
         be a significant element in the refusal. The Sponsor now  pays  her
         wages into her  bank  account  before  using  them.  Based  on  the
         evidence presented, there  is  nothing  to  suggest  that  a  fresh
         application would be rejected"

    It would appear that the Tribunal accepted this  "technical  argument",
    made in respect of her employment with Highfield Taxis, to be fatal  to
    the case under Appendix FM since the  appeal  is  dismissed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

 6. The determination goes on to address Article 8 as follows:

         "26.      ...  The  Sponsor  and  Appellant  are  in  a  subsisting
         relationship and, to the extent that they are able, have  a  family
         and private life together. The decision of the respondent  in  this
         case prevents them developing this. With regard to delay, this  was
         because the Respondent was waiting for the outcome of another  case
         concerning the financial requirements. It was  reasonable  for  the
         Respondent to wait for this as it might,  if  decided  differently,
         have resulted in the application being allowed. However, the  delay
         has been aggravated by the failure of the Respondent to have proper
         regard to  the  information  supplied  by  the  Appellant  and  the
         allegations  made  concerning  the  quality  of   the   information
         supplied.

         27.      Taking all of the factors into account I find  that  there
         are exceptional circumstances warranting the consideration of  this
         matter under Article 8 outside the Rules.

         28.      I have found that there is a genuine family  life  between
         the  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  and  that  the   decision   does
         significantly interfere with this. I also find that the decision is
         in accordance with the law and  for  the  purposes  of  maintaining
         immigration control. As a final  matter  consideration  has  to  be
         given to whether or not the decision to refuse entry clearance  was
         proportionately  justified.  Considering  all  the  matters  placed
         before me, I find in the circumstances that  the  decision  is  not
         proportionality justified. At most the decision taken  only  delays
         the  inevitable  and  has  wrongly  resulted  in   accusations   of
         falsehood. The benefit of enforcing immigration control is in  this
         case outweighed by the  harm  that  it  does  to  the  relationship
         between the Appellant and the Sponsor.

         29.      Accordingly, even  if  the  Appellant  did  not  meet  the
         requirements of Appendix FM, the Appellant and the Sponsor's rights
         under Article 8 outside of the  Rules  would  be  breached  by  the
         decision to refuse him entry to the United Kingdom.

         30.      For the  reasons  set  out  above  the  appeal  is  to  be
         allowed."

    Error of Law - Submissions

 7. The ECO submits that this reasoning is flawed in law on  the  following
    grounds:

      i) The Tribunal failed to identify what compelling circumstances there
         were to justify consideration of Article 8 outside  of  the  Rules:
         Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC)

     ii) An appeal can only be allowed under Article 8  where  there  is  an
         "unjustifiably harsh outcome": Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin)

    iii) It is open to the applicant to make a new application now  that  he
         meets all of the requirements of the Rules.

 8. In his submissions Mr McVeety adopted the grounds  and  amplified  them
    with reference to SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387: Article 8 is  not  to
    be treated as a general dispensing power.

 9. Ms Chaudhry explained that she has had to wait a very long time for her
    husband  to  join  her.  She  did  not  have  the  benefit   of   legal
    representation but she understood that she and her husband  had  always
    met the requirements of the Rules - she had earned  over  the  required
    �18,600 before they made the application, and continues to do so today.
    She had always had savings - in  fact  at  the  time  of  the  original
    application she had over �30,000 saved up but had used this  to  buy  a
    house for herself and her husband shortly before the decision. She  had
    paid her cash wages into the bank but not all of it every week  because
    she had not understood that this was a requirement.  She really did not
    want to have to make another application because it would mean  another
    delay and they had waited such a long time already.

10. Ms Chaudhry's reference to savings held prompted me to consider whether
    the Respondent could in fact show that he met the requirements  of  the
    Rules at the date of  decision,  rendering  any  error  in  respect  of
    Article 8 immaterial.  Mr McVeety very helpfully made  the  calculation
    that in order to do so Ms Chaudhry would need to have  had  �25,500  in
    the bank at the relevant time.  This figure derived from  paragraph  E-
    ECP.3.1 (b) wherein it states that  applicants  should  have  specified
    savings of �16,000 plus "additional savings of an amount equivalent  to
    2.5 times the amount which is the difference between the  gross  annual
    income" and the total amount normally  required.  The  salary  normally
    required is �18,600. It being accepted that Ms  Chaudhry  had  properly
    evidenced approximately �14,400 of her  earnings  (that  from  AA  Law)
    there was a shortfall of  �4,200  per  annum  when  the  earnings  from
    Highfield  were  excluded.    That  figure  multiplied  by  2.5  equals
    �10,500.  Ms Chaudhry would therefore need to show that at the date  of
    her husband's application she had savings of  �10,500  plus  �16,000  =
    �26,500.

11. I agreed to a short adjournment to permit Ms Chaudhry  to  provide  any
    evidence  she  had  pertaining  to  the  situation  at  the   date   of
    application. Ms Chaudhry submitted a letter dated 1st December 2015  in
    which she explained that she had been saving since she started work  at
    18 and that she  had  a  number  of  savings  accounts.   She  provided
    statements from  two  different  RBS  accounts  bearing  her  name  and
    covering the period immediately before the application  was  made.  One
    relates to a 'Bonus 30 annual' savings account and this shows  that  on
    the 21st October 2013 she had �19,159.56 in savings. The second relates
    to a 'student current' account which on the same date  held  �8,175.54.
    Transfers out of the accounts indicate that there is at least one other
    account; in her letter Ms Chaudhry explains  that  this  is  a  Halifax
    account connected to her mortgage.

    My Findings

12. Insofar as the grounds of appeal suggest, with  reference  to  Gulshan,
    that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  failing  to   impose   some
    intermediary test before going on to consider Article 8, this ground is
    without merit. There is no utility in imposing  such  a  test:  see  MM
    (Lebanon) at paragraph 129.

13. The crux of the ECO's case is that this applicant could  not  meet  the
    requirement of the Rules because his  wife  had  not  been  paying  her
    salary from her second  job  straight  into  the  bank  each  week.  He
    therefore failed to meet the requirements set out  in  Appendix  FM-SE.
    It is now accepted that the Tribunal was obliged to consider Article 8:
    see paragraph 47 SS (Congo).  In doing  so,  the  Tribunal  could  only
    allow the appeal on human rights grounds if the  applicant  could  show
    some compelling circumstances that outweighed the public interest.

14.  The  matters  identified  by  the  Tribunal   in   its   analysis   of
    proportionality were as follows. There  had  been  some  delay  in  the
    application being dealt with  because  the  ECO  was  waiting  for  the
    decision in MM. That was a reasonable course of action to take but  the
    effect of the delay upon the parties was exacerbated by the  fact  that
    when the application was finally assessed, false accusations were  made
    in respect of the veracity of the documents and the  information  given
    was not properly assessed.  This being a genuine couple waiting  to  be
    together the decision was only delaying the inevitable and there was no
    public interest in refusing leave to enter.

15. I share the sympathy that the First-tier Tribunal evidently had for  Ms
    Chaudhry and her husband.  No-one now disputes that Ms Chaudhry has had
    at all relevant times two jobs, and that she did earn, and continues to
    earn, over the required threshold of �18,600.  In  those  circumstances
    it was understandable that the First-tier Tribunal did not find  it  to
    be in the public interest that the Respondent continued  to  be  denied
    leave to enter.  The Tribunal made its decision on the 21st April  2015
    and did not therefore  have  the  benefit  of  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    reasoning in SS (Congo), a judgement handed down two days later on  the
    23rd April 2015.   The  Court  dealt  directly  with  the  question  of
    appeals which fail under Appendix FM-SE.  Two reasons are identified as
    to why "compelling circumstances" would have to be found before such  a
    case could succeed under Article 8. The  first  is  that  the  evidence
    rules have the same general objective as the substantive rules,  namely
    to limit the risk that someone is admitted into the United Kingdom  and
    then becomes a burden on public resources; it is for the  Secretary  of
    State to determine how best to do that [at 52]. The second is that  the
    same Rules apply to all applicants. As noted in Huang it  is  generally
    desirable that the Rules apply in a workable,  predictable,  consistent
    and fair manner.  If the Respondent was to be  in  effect  excused  his
    failure to comply with FM-SE he would have to show some good reason why
    he was entitled to preferential treatment with respect to the Rules  of
    evidence over other applicants applying in the same category [SS at 51-
    53].

16. I am not satisfied that the matters here identified by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal amount to either compelling circumstances or a good reason why
    the Respondent should have preferential treatment over others. The fact
    that there was a delay was unfortunate, but as the First-tier  Tribunal
    finds, there was good reason for it, since the appeal in MM was plainly
    material to the outcome of many applications under Appendix  FM.   That
    the application was turned down on a number of grounds, and  that  some
    of them were subsequently found to  be  without  foundation,  does  not
    change the fact that the application was doomed to fail from the moment
    it was lodged, because there were no statements which could  show  that
    the wages from Highfield Taxis were being deposited in a bank.   Having
    heard from Ms Chaudhry I am quite satisfied, as the First-tier Tribunal
    was, that this is a genuine relationship and  that  the  parties  would
    very much like to be living together. It has now been some three  years
    since they were married and they are no doubt frustrated by  the  delay
    and bureaucracy that they face.  That does not constitute a "compelling
    circumstance".  The central ground  of  appeal  is  made  out  and  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal must be set aside.

17. In respect of the re-made decision I have no reason to  doubt  that  at
    the time the application was made Ms Chaudhry held savings of �27, 334.
     I accept that this is so  because  I  have  been  provided  with  bank
    statements to that effect, and I have heard her credible oral evidence.
    That figure would, as Mr McVeety accepts, be enough for the  Respondent
    to succeed under  the  alternative  'savings'  route  in  Appendix  FM.
    Unfortunately I do not have the evidence before me to allow the  appeal
    on that ground. Appendix FM-SE specifies that  this  evidence  must  be
    provided in original form, and I have only been provided  with  scanned
    and emailed copies. Furthermore the money must  be  held  for  the  six
    months prior to the  application,  and  I  only  have  bank  statements
    showing the funds in place between September  and  October  2013.   The
    appeal therefore fails, again, because of a 'near miss' of  the  Rules.
    The Sponsor may wish to forward her original bank statements  (of  both
    RBS accounts as well as the missing Halifax statements),  covering  the
    period six months prior to the  application,  to  the  ECO.  Given  the
    already lengthy delay the ECO may wish to review these  and  avoid  the
    necessity of a fresh application.

    Decisions

18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law and it
    is set aside.

19. The decision in the appeal is re-made as follows:

    "The appeal is dismissed on all grounds".

20. I make no direction for anonymity because neither party  has  requested
    one and on the facts I do not consider such an order to be necessary.
