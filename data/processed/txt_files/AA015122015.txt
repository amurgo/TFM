                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This appeal raises a discrete question of law relating to the  validity
    of a decision to set aside an earlier determination.  Although this  is
    a pure point of law, it is necessary to first set out  the  history  of
    this matter so the question can be seen in context.

The Appellant's Immigration History

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Mauritius. He was born on  [~]  1980  and
    first came to the United Kingdom as a visitor on 27 November  2004.  In
    2005 he made applications for leave to remain as a  student  nurse  but
    was unsuccessful.  On 8 March 2010, the  Appellant  again  applied  for
    leave to remain, this time under para 395C Immigration  Rules,  section
    55 Borders Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 and art  3  of  the  UN
    Convention on the Rights  of  the  Child.  On  12  January  2011,  that
    application was also refused with no right of appeal (and an attempt to
    appeal was later struck out on 31  January  2011).   Subsequently,  the
    Appellant was arrested and, after twice absconding, on 9 October  2014,
    he was detained and directions were set for his removal on 14  November
    2014.

 3. Those  directions  were  cancelled  when,  on  14  November  2014,  the
    Appellant claimed asylum, based on what he said was his  fear  for  his
    life if returned to Mauritius - it being the Appellant's case  that  he
    had been threatened by both his wife's family and his own family due to
    disapproval of their marriage.  On  23  January  2015,  the  Respondent
    refused the Appellant's protection and human rights claims and  it  was
    decided that he should be removed from the United Kingdom ("the refusal
    decision").

 4.  On  28  January  2015,  the  Appellant  lodged   an   appeal   (Appeal
    AA/01512/2015) against that decision which was duly listed for  hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal (FtT Judge Wilson) on  4  February  2014
    under the Fast Track Rules 2014 ("the FTR 2014") then in place.   By  a
    reasoned decision promulgated on 12 February  2015,  FtT  Judge  Wilson
    allowed the appeal on the basis that the refusal decision had not  been
    made in accordance with the law and it was directed that the Respondent
    should now determine the Appellant's application for leave to remain on
    the basis of continuing relationship with his  children  in  accordance
    with section 55 Borders Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.  At  para
    24 of FtT Judge Wilson's ruling, however, it was noted that "The  claim
    for international protection, namely the  request  for  asylum  and  or
    Article 3 and or humanitarian protection is dismissed".

 5. On 11 March 2015, the Respondent issued a further  decision  to  remove
    the Appellant from the United Kingdom,  having  refused  him  leave  to
    remain on the basis of his Article 8 rights. Consideration was given to
    whether  there  were   significant   obstacles   to   the   Appellant's
    reintegration in Mauritius but it was concluded that there were not.

 6. On 16 March 2015, the Appellant  then  lodged  an  appeal  against  the
    further refusal decision  of  11  March  2015  (Appeal  AA/04471/2015),
    claiming that his life would be in danger in Mauritius. That appeal was
    also listed for hearing under the FTR 2014 and came before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal on 23 March  2015,  at  which  point  the  Appellant  was
    representing himself. By its decision promulgated on 26 March 2015, the
    First-tier Tribunal allowed the appeal in AA/04471/2015 on human rights
    grounds.

 7. On 13 April 2015, the Appellant was granted leave to  remain  until  25
    September 2017.

 8. On 25 September 2017, the Appellant's leave to remain expired.

The Decision to Set-Aside

 9. By its Judgment handed down on 29 July 2015, the Court of Appeal upheld
    a challenge to the FTR 2014 (see The Lord Chancellor v Detention Action
    [2015] EWCA Civ 840).  Subsequently, in appeals under the FTR 2014, the
    First-tier Tribunal has exercised its jurisdiction to set aside earlier
    appeal decisions by means of its power of  review  and  set  aside,  as
    provided by section 9 Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007  ("the
    TCEA")  and  rule  32  The  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier  Tribunal)
    (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014 ("the Procedure Rules").

10. On 10 January 2018, the Appellant's solicitors applied to the President
    of the First-tier Tribunal for the previous determination of his appeal
    in AA/01512/2015 to be set aside and listed for  re-hearing.   At  that
    stage, no mention was made of  the  appeal  in  AA/04471/2015  and  the
    subsequent grant of leave to remain.

11. On 20 February 2018, the President of the First-tier Tribunal duly gave
    Notice of his Decision, of his own motion, to  set  aside  the  earlier
    determination of FtT Judge Wilson in AA/01512/2015  and  directed  that
    the appeal would be re-determined by another Judge.

The Re-Hearing in AA/01512/2015 and the Decision Appealed

12. Thus, the Appellant's appeal in AA/01512/2015  came  before  FtT  Judge
    Sullivan at a hearing on 17 August 2018.  It was during the  course  of
    that hearing that mention was first  made  of  the  Appellant's  second
    appeal in AA/04471/2015 and the subsequent grant of leave to remain and
    its expiry on 25 September 2017.

13. In dismissing the appeal, FtT Judge Sullivan noted that the parties had
    been under an obligation to notify the First-tier Tribunal of the grant
    of leave to remain made  subsequent  to  the  determination  in  appeal
    AA/04471/2015 but had failed to do so. The Judge took the view that the
    determination of the Appellant's appeal in  AA/04471/2015,  promulgated
    on 26 March 2015, still stood as there had been no appeal within the 28-
    day time limit provided by rule 16(3)  of  the  Procedure  Rules;  that
    decision did not depart from the earlier dismissal of the asylum claim.
     Given that the Appellant had failed to comply the requirements of  the
    Procedure Rules, his appeal was dismissed for want of jurisdiction.

The Appeal

14. Pursuant to permission granted by UT Judge Rintoul, the  Appellant  now
    appeals against FtT Judge Sullivan's decision.  The grounds  of  appeal
    can be summarised as follows:

      1) The First-tier Tribunal had exceeded its statutory power; it  could
         not go behind the decision to set-aside under rule 32.

      2) The First-tier Tribunal had further erred in law  in  finding  that
         the Appellant's appeal was out of time.  Only upon being set  aside
         on 20 February 2018 was the appeal in AA/01512/2015 to  be  treated
         as "pending". At that point, he did not fall to be  treated  as  an
         appellant who "is" granted leave to  remain  for  the  purposes  of
         section 104(4A) Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

      3) Further or in the alternative, the First-tier Tribunal had erred in
         refusing to extend time under rule 16(3) of the Procedure Rules.

The Law

15. Section 104 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  ("the
    2002 Act") provides (relevantly) as follows:

         'Section 104 Pending appeal

      1) An appeal under section 82(1) [an appeal to the First-Tier Tribunal
         against specified decisions of the Respondent]  is  pending  during
         the period-

          a) beginning when it is instituted, and

          b) ending when it is finally determined, withdrawn  or  abandoned
             ...

      2) An appeal under section 82(1) is not finally determined ... while-

          a) An application for permission to appeal under section 11 or 13
             of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement  Act  2007  could  be
             made or is awaiting determination,

          b) Permission to appeal under either of those sections  has  been
             granted and the appeal is awaiting determination, or

          c) An appeal has been remitted under section 12 or 14 of that Act
             and is awaiting determination.

      3) ...

      4) ...

         (4A) An appeal under section 82(1) brought by a person while he  is
         in the  United  Kingdom  shall  be  treated  as  abandoned  if  the
         appellant is granted  leave  to  enter  or  remain  in  the  United
         Kingdom.

         (4B) Subsection (4A) shall not apply to an appeal in so far  as  it
         is brought on [a ground specified in section  84(1)(a)  or  (b)  or
         84(3) (asylum or humanitarian protection) where the appellant -

          a) ...

          b) gives notice, in accordance with the Tribunal Procedure Rules,
             that he wishes to pursue the appeal in so far as it is brought
             on that ground.

             ...'




16. By the TCEA, powers are given to the First-tier Tribunal, as follows:

         '9.      Review of decision of the First-tier Tribunal

         (1)      The First-tier Tribunal may review a decision made  by  it
         on a matter in as case, other than a decision that is  an  excluded
         decision for the purposes of  section  11(1)  (but  see  subsection
         (9)),

         (2)      The First-tier Tribunal's power under  subsection  (1)  in
         relation to a decision is exercisable-

             (a) of its own initiative,

             (b) on application by a person who for the purposes of section
             11(2) has a right of appeal in respect of the decision.

         ...

      4) Where the First-tier Tribunal has under subsection (1)  reviewed  a
         decision, the First-tier Tribunal may in the light of the review do
         any of the following-

          a) correct accidental errors in the decision or in  a  record  of
             the decision.

             ...

             (c) set the decision aside.

         ...

         (9)      This section has effect as if a decision under  subsection
         4(c) to set aside an earlier decision were not an excluded decision
         for the purposes of section 11(1), but  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
         only power in the light of a  review  under  subsection  (1)  of  a
         decision under subsection (4)(c)  is  the  power  under  subsection
         4(a).

         (10)     A decision of the First-tier Tribunal may not be  reviewed
         under subsection (1) more than once ...'

17. By section 11, the TCEA provides for a right of  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, as follows:

         '11.     Right of appeal to Upper Tribunal

      1) For the purposes of subsection (2), the reference  to  a  right  of
         appeal to the Upper Tribunal is to a right of appeal on  any  point
         of law arising from a decision  made  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         other than an excluded decision.

         ...

      5) For the purposes of subsection (1), an "excluded decision" is-

             ...

             (d) a decision of the First-tier Tribunal under section 9-

             ...

                  (iii)       to  set  aside  an  earlier  decision  of  the
                  tribunal,

                  ...

             (e) a decision of the First-tier Tribunal that  is  set  aside
             under  section  9  (including  a  decision  set  aside   after
             proceedings on an appeal under this section have begun).'

18. The relevant parts of the Procedure Rules then provide:

         'Appeal treated as abandoned or finally determined

         16.-     (1)  A party must notify the Tribunal if  they  are  aware
             that-

                  ...

                  (b)  the appellant has been  granted  leave  to  enter  or
                  remain in the United Kingdom;

             (2) Where an  appeal  is  treated  as  abandoned  pursuant  to
             section 104(4A) of the 2002 Act or paragraph 4(2) of  Schedule
             2 to 2006 Regulations, the Tribunal must send  the  parties  a
             notice informing them that the  appeal  is  being  treated  as
             abandoned or finally determined, as the case may be.

             (3) Where an appeal would otherwise  fall  to  be  treated  as
             abandoned pursuant to section 104(4A) of the 2002 Act, but the
             appellant wishes to pursue their appeal,  the  appellant  must
             provide a notice, which must comply with any relevant practice
             direction, to the Tribunal and each other party so that it  is
             received within 28 days of the date on which the appellant was
             sent notice of the grant of leave to enter or  remain  in  the
             United Kingdom or was sent the document  listed  in  paragraph
             4(2) of Schedule 2 to the 2006 Regulations, as  the  case  may
             be.

             ...




         Setting aside a decision which disposes of proceedings

         32.-     (1)  The Tribunal may set aside a decision which  disposes
             of proceedings, or part of such a decision,  and  re-make  the
             decision, or the relevant part of it, if-

                  (a)  the Tribunal considers that it is in the interests of
                  justice to do so; and

                  (b)  one or more of the conditions in  paragraph  (2)  are
                  satisfied.

             (2) The conditions are-

             ...

                  (d)  there has been some other procedural irregularity  in
                  the proceedings.

                  ...'

19. We further remind ourselves that  an  order  of  a  court  or  tribunal
    remains effective unless and until challenged and set  aside,  even  if
    the court or tribunal concerned had no jurisdiction to make  the  order
    in question, see Patel v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 1175 at paras 54 and  71;
    specifically, see the observation of Sir Richard  Aikens  at  para  54,
    where he noted: "Like all orders of a court or tribunal, it must remain
    effective until challenged and set aside, even if it was  made  without
    the court or tribunal having jurisdiction to do so.".

Discussion and Conclusions

20.  We note that the position of both parties before us is that the appeal
    should be allowed. Notwithstanding that agreement, if we took the  view
    that the First-tier Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to determine the
    appeal, we would be bound to  reject  this  challenge  and  uphold  the
    decision below.

21. Before engaging with the detail of the arguments, we further note  that
    the fact of the second appeal (AA/04471/2015) and the subsequent  grant
    of leave to remain were matters only drawn  to  the  attention  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge during the course of the hearing on 17 August
    2018; it does not appear that the Judge was greatly  assisted  at  that
    stage as to  the  relevance  of  those  matters  given  the  subsequent
    decision to set-aside in appeal AA/01512/2015.  It was in that  context
    that the FtT Judge apparently considered  that  the  earlier  grant  of
    leave to remain had been fatal as, under section 104(4A)  of  the  2002
    Act, any appeal against the determination of  12  February  2015  would
    then fall to be treated as abandoned unless the Appellant  gave  notice
    that  he  wished  to  pursue  the  appeal  on  asylum  or  humanitarian
    protection grounds, a notice that would have had to be  given  pursuant
    to rule 16 Procedure Rules. On that view, by the time of  the  decision
    to set aside (20 February 2018), there was no longer  any  live  appeal
    and the First-tier Tribunal  had  no  jurisdiction  to  set  aside  the
    earlier determination.

22. The problem with that approach, however, is  that  it  meant  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal was effectively seeking to set aside  the  decision
    of 20 February 2018 when it had no power to do so.  Whether or not  the
    First-tier Tribunal had jurisdiction to make the decision to set-aside,
    the order that it thus made remained effective (see  Patel).   Although
    it might have been open to either party  to  apply  for  permission  to
    judicially review the set-aside  decision,  neither  did  so.   As  the
    decision to set-aside was an "excluded decision", as defined by section
    11(5) TCEA, it was not open to the First-tier Tribunal to then  purport
    to review it, still less set it aside (see section 9  TCEA).   For  the
    same reasons, it is equally not open to the Upper Tribunal to  seek  to
    set aside that earlier decision.  The set-aside decision remained - and
    remains - effective.

23. Having reached that view, it is strictly unnecessary for us  to  engage
    with the Appellant's further argument that section 104(4A) of the  2002
    Act did not, in any event, apply so as to cast doubt on the  First-tier
    Tribunal's  jurisdiction  to  make   the   set-aside   decision.    For
    completeness, however, we make clear that we also take the  view  that,
    at the time the set-aside decision was made, the Appellant's  leave  to
    remain had expired (it had expired on 25 September  2017,  nearly  five
    months earlier) and, as such, the  Appellant  was  not  at  that  stage
    someone who "is granted leave  ...  to  remain"  for  the  purposes  of
    section 104(4A) of the 2002 Act (emphasis  added).   Moreover,  at  the
    time of the grant of leave to remain, the appeal in  AA/01512/2015  had
    been "finally determined" for section 104(4A) purposes  and,  as  such,
    there was nothing to be treated as "abandoned" when leave to remain was
    granted on 13 April 2015.  It was only at the point  when  the  earlier
    determination in AA/01512/2015 was set aside, on 20 February 2018, that
    the appeal was again to be treated  as  "pending".   And,  as  we  have
    already observed, at that stage, there was nothing  that  would  engage
    section 104(4A) so  as  to  mean  the  appeal  was  to  be  treated  as
    "abandoned".

24. For those reasons, we  agree  with  the  parties  that  the  appeal  in
    AA/01512/2015 was revived by the set-aside decision (and thus became  a
    "pending appeal") and that section 104(4A) of  the  2002  Act  did  not
    operate such that it was then to be treated as abandoned.

25. Given its view on jurisdiction, the First-tier Tribunal did not  engage
    with the merits of the Appellant's appeal and the appropriate course is
    for this matter to be remitted for re-hearing before a different  Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and we set it aside

We remit the decision to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing.
