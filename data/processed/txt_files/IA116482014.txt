For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R O Ojukotola, Legal Representative, SLA
Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to the appellant as the secretary of  state  and  to  the
    respondent as "the claimant."


 2. The claimant is a national of Nigeria born on 18 June 1976. His  appeal
    against the respondent's decision  to  refuse  his  application  for  a
    residence card under Regulation 17 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations
    2006 ("the 2006 Regulations") as the husband of the sponsor, a  citizen
    of Estonia, and an EEA National, was  allowed  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Boardman in a determination promulgated on 10 April 2015.


 3. He  found  that  the  claimant  and  his  sponsor  were  in  a  durable
    relationship  for  the  purpose  of  Regulation  8(5)   of   the   2006
    Regulations.


 4. That finding has not been challenged.


 5. However, permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  was  granted  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Brunnen on 3 June 2015 on  the  grounds  that
    the Judge erred in allowing the appeal outright and that he should have
    remitted the matter to the secretary  of  state  for  her  to  exercise
    discretion under Regulation 17(4) of the 2006 Regulations.


 6. Mr Tufan relied on the Upper Tribunal  decisions  in  Ihemedu  (OFMs  -
    Meaning) Nigeria [2011] UKUT  340  (IAC)  and  TA  and  Others  (Kareem
    explained) Ghana [2014] UKUT 00316 (IAC).


 7. Mr Ojukotola accepted that there had been an error of law to the extent
    referred to. Regulation  17(4)  of  the  2006  Regulations  provides  a
    discretion to the secretary of state to issue a residence  card  to  an
    "extended family member". It is evident that in this case the secretary
    of state has not yet considered the exercise of such discretion. It  is
    not open to the Tribunal to consider the exercise of discretion in  the
    absence of the secretary of state first doing so.


    Notice of Decision


    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and is set aside.  The decision I substitute  is  to  allow  the
    claimant's appeal to  the  extent  that  his  application  for  an  EEA
    residence card remains outstanding before the Secretary of State.


    No anonymity direction is made.
