                                   Between

                                SAMUEL APPIAH
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms J Isherwood, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R Griffiths-Anderson, a legal representative with
                    Frederick Rine Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of  State  challenged  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to allow the appellant's appeal against her decision to refuse
    him an EEA residence card as the  extended  family  member  of  an  EEA
    national with whom he was in a durable relationship.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Graham found as a fact that  such  a  durable
    relationship existed and allowed the appeal outright, which  was  wrong
    in law: the correct outcome should have been to allow the appeal to the
    extent that it was not in  accordance  with  the  law,  to  enable  the
    respondent to consider the exercise of her discretion under  regulation
    17(4) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006  (as
    amended).

 3. By consent, it was  agreed  that  an  appropriate  decision  should  be
    substituted. The finding of the First-tier Tribunal as to the existence
    of a durable relationship at the date of hearing  (13  April  2015)  is
    expressly preserved.

Conclusions:

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law. I set aside the  decision  and  remake
it by allowing the claimant's appeal to the extent  that  the  Secretary  of
State's decision is not in accordance  with  law  and  that  the  claimant's
application remains before her for the making of  a  lawful  decision  under
Regulation 17(4) of the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
2006 (as amended).
