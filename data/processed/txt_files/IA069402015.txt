For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant is a male citizen of Pakistan born on  20th  March  1980.
    He first arrived in the United Kingdom on 13th May  2011  when  he  was
    given leave to enter as a student until 13th April 2014.  On 6th  March
    2014 he applied for  leave  to  remain  in  the  same  capacity.   That
    application was refused on 29th January 2015 for the reasons  given  in
    the Respondent's letter of that date.  That appeal was decided by Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal  Farrelly  (the  Judge)  on  the  papers  at
    Belfast on 21st July 2015.  He decided to dismiss the  appeal  for  the
    reasons given in his Decision promulgated on 26th  October  2015.   The
    Appellant sought leave to appeal that decision, and  on  2nd  May  2016
    such permission was granted.

Error of Law

 2. I must first decide if the decision of the Judge contained an error  on
    a point of law so that it should be set aside.

 3. The Appellant's application was refused  as  the  Appellant  failed  to
    score sufficient points for a Confirmation of  Acceptance  for  Studies
    (CAS) under Appendix A of  HC  395.   This  is  because  the  Appellant
    intended to study for a qualification  from  the  Chartered  Management
    Institute and that body  did  not  list  the  Centre  for  Teaching  in
    Management, where the Appellant  intended  to  study,  as  an  approved
    centre.

 4. The Judge dismissed the appeal because he found  that  decision  to  be
    correct,  notwithstanding  evidence  from  the   Appellant   that   the
    Respondent had searched under the name of "Center" whereas the  correct
    name of the educational establishment was "Centre".

 5. At the hearing, Mr Ali argued that the Judge had erred in law in coming
    to this conclusion as there had been evidence before him of  a  mistake
    by the Respondent as to  the  correct  spelling  of  the  name  of  the
    educational establishment at which the  Appellant  proposed  to  study.
    The Judge had not dealt with this evidence.

 6. In response, Mr Mills said that the Judge had come to a reasonable  and
    sustainable finding, and that the Appellant had failed to discharge the
    burden of proof upon him to show that there had been a  mistake  as  to
    the spelling of the educational establishment at  which  the  Appellant
    proposed to study.

 7. I find a material error of law in the decision of  the  Judge  which  I
    therefore set aside.  There was evidence  before  the  Judge  that  the
    Respondent  had  searched  the  records  of  the  Chartered  Management
    Institute under a wrong spelling of the name of the Centre for Teaching
    in Management.  This was a complete explanation of why  the  Respondent
    had found the CAS not to be valid.  Even though the appeal was  decided
    on the papers, the Judge should have dealt with this evidence  and  his
    failure to do so amounts to an error of law.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside that decision and the appeal to the Upper Tribunal  is  allowed.


Re-made Decision

The validity of the CAS was the only issue in the original appeal.   I  have
now  seen  evidence  that  the  CAS  produced  by  the  Appellant  with  his
application was valid and I therefore find that he scores sufficient  points
under Appendix F of HC 395 to qualify for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
(General) Student by meeting the requirements of paragraph 245ZX of HC  395.
 I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order  for  anonymity.   I  was  not
asked to do so, and indeed find no reason to do so.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

In the light of my decision  to  re-make  the  decision  in  the  appeal  by
allowing it, I have  considered  whether  to  make  a  fee  award.   As  the
original  application  of  the  Appellant  was  refused  in  error  by   the
Respondent, I make a whole fee award in the sum of ï¿½80.
