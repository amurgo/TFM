                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Anonymity order

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) I continue an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal or  a
Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  original
Appellant. This direction applies  to,  amongst  others,  all  parties.  Any
failure to comply with this direction could give rise to contempt  of  court
proceedings.

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing her appeal against the  respondent's  decision
    to deport her as a foreign criminal pursuant to section 32(5) of the UK
    Borders Act 2007, subject to section 33 of that Act.

 2. The appellant is a Brazilian citizen and the mother  of  a  3-year  old
    British citizen daughter.  She entered the United Kingdom in June 2011,
    with her British partner.  She travelled on her own  passport  and  was
    granted 6 months leave to enter.  She has had  no  leave  to  enter  or
    remain in the United Kingdom since December 2011.

 3. The appellant does not dispute that she is a foreign  criminal.   On  6
    September 2013 at Preston Crown Court, along with her  British  citizen
    partner, and two other defendants, the appellant pleaded guilty  to  an
    offence of conspiring to produce a controlled Class B drug  (cannabis).



 4. The appellant's partner went to prison for 4ï¿½ years for his part in the
    offences.  The appellant, whose role in the conspiracy  was  relatively
    minor, was sentenced  to  18  months'  imprisonment.  She  was  heavily
    pregnant and her British citizen daughter was born on 4  October  2013,
    during her imprisonment.  The appellant was released from prison on  25
    October 2013.

Decision letter

 5. On 13 October 2014, the  respondent  made  a  decision  to  remove  the
    appellant to Brazil as a foreign criminal.  The respondent  noted  that
    the appellant's English remained very limited.  There was  no  evidence
    that she was socially or culturally integrated in the  United  Kingdom.
    She had an older son living in Brazil, where the  appellant  had  lived
    for most of her  life:  she  kept  in  touch  with  him  by  skype  and
    telephone.  She had brothers in  Brazil,  and  also  her  father.   The
    appellant would be able to reintegrate in Brazil without difficulty.

 6. Her British  citizen  child  was  then  barely  a  year  old,  and  the
    appellant, on her evidence, was still breastfeeding her.  The  name  of
    the child's father did not appear on her birth  certificate  and  there
    were no custody proceedings or contact orders giving him any rights  in
    relation to the child. The respondent considered that it was not unduly
    harsh for the appellant  to  be  deported  without  her  partner.   The
    parties could live together in Brazil, as they had in  Spain,  if  they
    chose to do so.

 7.  The  Secretary  of  State  considered  whether  any  very   compelling
    circumstances had been shown, over and above the circumstances set  out
    in the exceptions to deportation.  She did not consider that the family
    links  which  the  appellant  had  with  her  partner's   family   were
    sufficient, and no other circumstances had been advanced.

 8. The Secretary of State considered whether the appellant should be given
    a  Zambrano  derivative  residence  right  but  in  the  light  of  her
    criminality and liability for deportation, she did not consider that to
    be appropriate. It would not be unduly harsh for the child to remain in
    the United Kingdom  with other family members, adapting to life without
    her mother.

Appeal proceedings

 9. The First-tier Tribunal noted that the appellant had gone to Spain as a
    tourist in 2000 and remained there, being allowed to  work.   In  2004,
    she married a Spanish citizen.  In 2005 she returned to  Brazil,  where
    she spent 2 years before rejoining her Spanish husband in 2008.   There
    were no children of that marriage.

10. In 2009, the appellant  met  her  current  partner  and  they  began  a
    relationship, although she was still married.  She thought she was  now
    divorced, but the evidence was with her sister in northern  Spain.  The
    appellant's residence document for Spain expired without being  renewed
    in March 2013. The appellant's partner's evidence was that he  did  not
    know about the Spanish marriage until he came out of prison, in 2014.

11. In my decision of 7 January 2016, I set aside  that  decision,  on  the
    basis that:

         "13. At the hearing, it became clear that not only was the child of
         an age where in practice she could not be  expected  to  leave  her
         mother (whose evidence was that she  was  still  breastfeeding  her
         daughter), but that as a matter of law, her mother was the  child's
         only parent because the father's name does not appear on the  birth
         certificate.  There is no court order  for  contact,  residence  or
         maintenance, and the parties are not married.  On that basis, it is
         difficult to see how she could be cared for in the  United  Kingdom
         after her mother's departure by  her  putative  father,  without  a
         court order or Social Services involvement.  As a  matter  of  law,
         the child would have no parent  in  the  United  Kingdom  once  her
         mother left.

         14.  It is by no  means  certain  that  Social  Services  would  be
         content to leave the child, young as she is, in  the  care  of  her
         putative father and his extended family.  He is guilty of the  same
         criminal offence for which  the  respondent  seeks  to  remove  the
         appellant, and has no legal right for the child to live  with  him,
         or to make the necessary medical or schooling decisions  about  the
         child if  required.   That  is  a  matter  which  requires  further
         consideration and we are concerned that neither the respondent  nor
         the First-tier Tribunal appears to have given it any weight. ..."

12. The timing of the resumed hearing was delayed with  a  view  to  having
    available the decision of  the  Court  of  Appeal  on  what  became  MM
    (Uganda) & Anor v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2016]
    EWCA Civ 450, which was handed down on 20 April 2016.

13. It is now appropriate to seek to remake the decision  in  this  appeal.
    The appellant and her partner both gave evidence against their  witness
    statements of 29 April 2015, and I also have the  written  evidence  of
    the appellant's partner's parents, and of his grandmother who lives  in
    Spain, in statements all dated 14 April 2015.

Background

14. The underlying facts and  matters  are  not  disputed.   The  following
    information emerges from the documents before me, including the witness
    statements of the appellant, her partner, and his parents.

15. The appellant left Brazil in 2000 to live in  Spain,  but  returned  to
    Brazil for a year in 2005.   According  to  the  decision  letter,  the
    appellant has a son from an earlier relationship in Brazil,  with  whom
    she keeps in touch by Skype and telephone. She has brothers there,  and
    her father also.  The appellant married a Spanish man but there are  no
    children from that  relationship.   She  has  not  shown  that  she  is
    divorced from her Spanish husband: she says she thinks she is, but that
    the papers would be with her sister, in Spain.

16. The appellant's relationship with her father in Brazil is described  as
    very distant.  She has not lived with him since returning to Europe  in
    2006. The appellant returned to live in Spain: one of her sisters lived
    in Northern Spain, and she had friends  in  the  South,  so  she  moved
    around the country.  The appellant's mother died in 2007.

17.  In  2009,  she  met  her  partner  in  Malaga,  through  friends.  The
    appellant's partner had moved to live in Spain in June 2006,  returning
    to the United Kingdom from time to time.  He worked in bars, and  lived
    sometimes with his maternal grandmother in Alicante.   He  had  friends
    there, too.  In January 2009, he had a job with a  removal  company  in
    Alicante. He has no connections with Brazil.

18.  After  meeting  in  Malaga,  the  couple  moved  into   his   maternal
    grandmother's property, and stayed in Alicante until March  2011,  when
    they moved, first to Malaga, and  then  to  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    parties have lived together (except when in prison) for  7  years  now.
    The appellant is not married to her partner, but the Secretary of State
    has accepted  that  he  is  the  child's  father.   Their  relationship
    continues.

19. The appellant and her partner came to the United Kingdom in June  2011,
    as the partner's employer in Spain had an opportunity for  him  in  the
    United Kingdom.  On entry, the appellant was given a visit visa,  which
    she overstayed. Her partner was required to work as a live-in  security
    guard in a disused garden centre, which had 5 flats,  an  office  block
    and a warehouse as well.  There had been thefts of lead and copper from
    the unused greenhouses. The parties were allocated one  of  the  flats.
    Another was occupied for a time, but the couple living there moved out.



20. For about a year, they were the only people living there, but then  the
    office block came back into use and there  were  building  works.   The
    people renting the office block were growing cannabis  in  the  disused
    greenhouses.  At her partner's request, the appellant  agreed  to  help
    him keep the rooms clean and tidy where the cannabis  was  grown.   The
    appellant thought she was just doing her partner a favour.  She is  not
    herself a cannabis smoker and never  has  been,  but  her  partner  had
    formerly smoked it. It did not occur to the appellant that what she was
    doing was 'seriously wrong', according to her statement.

21. Both parties regret what they did. They want to put the offence  behind
    them and bring up their daughter together: she is British  born  and  a
    citizen of the United Kingdom.  The  child  has  many  extended  family
    members on her father's side, here  in  the  United  Kingdom,  and  the
    family hope that they will be able to visit  the  appellant's  extended
    family in Brazil so that the child knows them too.

22. The appellant's partner has  explored  the  possibility  of  living  in
    Brazil, but the Brazilian Consulate told him that as the  parties  were
    not married, he could not have a settlement visa as  her  partner.   He
    considers that it will be difficult for him to find work in Brazil,  as
    he has no qualifications, and that, since he does not speak Portuguese,
    he would struggle to provide for his wife and daughter or to find  them
    anywhere to live.

23. The appellant's partner's parents are supportive of them as  a  family.
    His father says that the appellant's partner went to live in Spain from
    about 2006,  returning  for  a  short  break  from  time  to  time.  He
    understood that his son worked in the removals  business  for  most  of
    that time.  They kept in contact over the telephone.  He refers to  the
    appellant as 'my daughter-in-law' and says in his  statement  that  the
    couple lived with him and his wife for a week, before going to  Preston
    to take up the job, which came with a flat. The work was for  the  same
    employer for whom the appellant's partner had worked in Spain.

24. The appellant's partner's father  and  his  wife  have  never  been  in
    trouble with the police and had made their disapproval of the  offences
    very clear to the couple.  They love  their  granddaughter  dearly  and
    will ensure that the couple have the support they  need  so  that  they
    never  offend  again.   Although  shocked  and  disappointed   by   the
    activities which  resulted  in  the  arrest  and  imprisonment  of  the
    appellant and his son, he says that he has every confidence  that  what
    they did 'is now firmly in the past' and that they  have  both  learned
    their lesson.

25. The couple were living with him and his wife again, after coming out of
    prison (when this statement was made, the  child  was  only  18  months
    old).  There is a large extended family and 'we all muck  in  together'
    so there was plenty of family support.  The young  couple  were  saving
    for a home of their own.  In Brazil, the support available  here  would
    not be there for them,  and  without  any  help  with  the  child,  the
    appellant would be unable to work and help to keep  the  family.   They
    would have no jobs and nowhere to live.  He asked for them to be  given
    another chance.

26. The mother of the appellant's partner added that they  learned  of  the
    offence when their son asked his parents to  look  after  the  couple's
    dogs after they were arrested.   Deportation  of  the  appellant  would
    split up the family: her son would have to go to Brazil, if  he  could,
    but it was very unclear whether he would be allowed to do  so,  and  he
    would be on licence until 2016.  The wider family would suffer the loss
    of their relationships with the child, with whom they all spent  a  lot
    of time, as they were a close extended family, all  living  quite  near
    each other.

27. The statement concludes:

         "11. If [the appellant] is deported then no matter what way this is
         looked at, the only true victim is [the child].   Either  she  will
         grow up without her mother, or without her father, or  without  her
         extended family.  That is something I do not want to see happen and
         I will do all that I can to ensure that it does not. ...

         12.  I am also aware that if [the appellant] is deported, she would
         not be able to return to the United Kingdom for 10 years, and  that
         even then there is no guarantee that she  would  be  able  to  come
         back.  That would seriously impact upon [the child's] life, because
         my husband and I would not be able to afford to  go  to  Brazil  to
         visit that often.  At the moment [the  child]  lives  with  us  and
         therefore sees us every day.  That would be too much of a change to
         go from see us every day to not at all.

         13.  For all of the reasons above, I  would  ask  the  Court  as  a
         mother and grandmother to give this family a second chance."

28. A statement from the partner's maternal grandmother says that she is  a
    British citizen who spends the winter in Spain and the  summer  in  the
    United Kingdom, when she lives with her daughter (the partner's mother)
    and her son-in-law. She explains in her statement  that  the  appellant
    and her partner both lived at the grandmother's apartment in  Alicante,
    from March 2010 until March 2011.  The appellant's partner  was  living
    there with from November 2009 and March 2011 (she thinks he was  living
    in Spain from approximately Summer 2008-June 2011).

29. I turn now to the oral evidence of the appellant and her partner, given
    at the hearing.

Appellant's evidence

30. The appellant confirmed her name  and  address  and  adopted  her  2015
    statement.  She said that she could speak and read  a  little  English,
    and that she had the statement translated to  her  before  signing  it.
    She asked me to treat her statement as her primary evidence  in  chief.
    Their child was now 3 years old.

31. If she were deported, it would be difficult for the appellant  and  her
    child to come back and visit her partner in  the  United  Kingdom,  for
    financial reasons.  Air tickets were very expensive. It was not a  good
    idea for the child to be left behind with her father, but nor could  he
    travel with them to Brazil. Her partner spoke no Portuguese,  which  is
    the language of Brazil.  He would not be allowed to move there, because
    he had a criminal history now, and also even if he did,  she  was  sure
    her partner would be unable to find a job.  He had committed no further
    criminal offences since leaving prison.

32. In cross-examination, the appellant confirmed that her partner  is  now
    named as the child's father on the birth certificate. However,  if  the
    appellant were returned to Brazil without her  daughter,  she  did  not
    think that her partner would be prepared to look after the child.   She
    preferred not even to contemplate the very  difficult  situation  which
    would ensue; the child would have to travel to Brazil  and  live  there
    with the appellant.  The situation  affected  the  parents,  the  child
    herself, and the whole extended family.

33. There was no re-examination.

Appellant's partner's evidence

34. The appellant's partner adopted his December 2015 witness statement and
    confirmed that he wished it to stand as  his  evidence  in  chief.   He
    confirmed his employment history in Spain, and  that  the  parties  are
    unmarried partners.

35. In answer to supplementary questions from Mr  Sharma,  the  appellant's
    partner said that he considered  it  best  for  a  child  to  have  two
    parents.  If the appellant had to return to Brazil, he considered  that
    he would have to bring the child up alone in  the  United  Kingdom;  it
    would be harder, as she would not see her mother very much, if at  all.
    At 3 years old, the child was a little person who talked and  knew  all
    of her extended family fully.  If he had to  bring  her  up  alone,  he
    would sort something out, but he would have to keep working, and all of
    his family members also worked.  They would have to  find  somebody  to
    look after the child. He might have no option but to give up  work  and
    care for his daughter himself.

36. The couple had no savings: if the appellant took the  child  to  Brazil
    with her they would have to start from scratch.  The child's  life  was
    in the United Kingdom.  He had not  given  much  thought  to  going  to
    Brazil because he did not speak the language,  had  no  qualifications,
    and was not sure he would be accepted, as he had a criminal conviction.
     Even if he was allowed to go, it would not be easy.

37. In reality, the appellant's partner expected that he would  manage,  at
    best, telephone contact, as he simply did  not  earn  enough  to  visit
    regularly, half way around the world.  There would be no possibility of
    a close father-daughter  relationship.  He  had  not  indulged  in  any
    criminal behaviour since coming out of prison.   He  had  got  straight
    into full-time employment, and while in prison, he had  given  up  both
    cannabis and nicotine.  Both of them had pleaded guilty: he knew he had
    been silly and greedy.

38. There was no cross-examination.

Submissions

39. For the respondent, Mr Lindsay relied  on  the  refusal  letter  of  16
    October 2014 and on his skeleton argument, which had been served  late.
    The respondent had been entitled to consider that the  appellant  could
    not bring herself within the human rights exception in  section  33  of
    the 2007 Act.  She had applied properly paragraphs  A362  and  A398  to
    399D of the Rules, which should be regarded  as  a  complete  code  for
    considering Article 8 ECHR claims, reflecting Parliament's view of what
    the public interest requires under Article 8(2), as further set out  in
    Part VA of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  (as
    amended).

40. The exception to deportation was set out at  paragraph  399(a)  of  the
    Rules.  There was no issue  as  to  the  genuineness  of  the  parental
    relationship nor the citizenship of the child: the issue was whether it
    would be unduly harsh for the child to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom
    without her mother, or to go to Brazil without her father.  It was  the
    Secretary of State's case that  applying  Sanade  and  others  (British
    children - Zambrano -  Dereci)  [2012]  UKUT  00048  (IAC)  and  Izuazu
    (Article 8 - new Rules) [2013] UKUT 45 (IAC), and Regulation 21A of the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (as amended), the
    appellant's derivative residence rights could be  abrogated  where  her
    removal is 'conducive to the public good'.  The Secretary of State  was
    not minded to grant Zambrano derivative residence on these facts as she
    was not satisfied that for the child to live with her mother in  Brazil
    would be unduly harsh, nor for her to remain with  her  father  in  the
    United Kingdom, if  that  was  what  the  parties  chose.   There  were
    extended family members in the United Kingdom  who  could  assist  him.
    The appellant had not shown  that  she  met  the  requirements  of  the
    exception to deportation in paragraph 399(a).

41. Nor had she met the 'partner'  exception  at  paragraph  399(b).    The
    respondent did not consider that it  would  be  unduly  harsh  for  the
    appellant's partner to live in Brazil,  or  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom  without  her,  on  the  evidence.   The  choice  was  for  the
    appellant's partner, not the respondent to make.

42. In his skeleton argument, Mr Avery argued that this was a  particularly
    serious offence and that the respondent had accepted the  parentage  of
    the child.  The skeleton argument at paragraph 6 says  this  about  the
    legal difficulty of the parties not being  married  and  the  partner's
    name not being on the birth certificate:

         "6.  With reference to the issue of the child's father's  name  not
         being on the birth certificate, the Secretary of State has accepted
         (paragraph 20 of the decision letter) that the  appellant's  father
         is the father and therefore the child is British.  If the appellant
         and her partner are now maintaining that there is doubt about  this
         then the Secretary of State will be only too happy to re-visit this
         concession.  Otherwise the Secretary  of  State  would  expect  any
         responsible parent to have the father's details added, particularly
         if a failure to do so will cause  complications  of  any  sort  for
         their child.  It would therefore be difficult to view  the  failure
         to have the father's  details  added  as  anything  other  than  an
         attempt to complicate the issue of the appellant's removal  and  as
         such it should not be something that should be  allowed  to  assist
         the appellant.  In those circumstances, any potential complications
         that the child would face would  then  be  counterbalanced  in  the
         'undue harshness' consideration by what, on its face, appears to be
         a cynical attempt to manipulate the Rules."

43. In oral argument, Mr Lindsay observed  that  the  appellant's  personal
    conduct had led to her criminal conviction and that, in  addition,  she
    had knowingly overstayed for all but 6 months of her time in the United
    Kingdom.  She  had  been  here  for  6  months  lawfully  and  4  years
    illegally.  He accepted that the  appellant's  criminal  offending  had
    been  at  a  relatively  low  level  in  a   relatively   sophisticated
    conspiracy, relying on the sentencing remarks.

44. Dealing with Regulation 9 of the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 (as amended), Mr Lindsay argued that the appellant was
    entitled only to the lowest level of protection from removal,  even  if
    she was the family member of a British citizen.  Her  personal  conduct
    was just enough to reach the threshold where a family  split  could  be
    justified.

45. Under Regulation 15A (the derivative residence provision),  Mr  Lindsay
    argued that it was not open to the Tribunal  to  find  that  the  child
    would have to leave the European Union if the appellant were deported.

46. In relation to the unduly harsh test, there was no evidence before  the
    Upper  Tribunal  concerning  Brazilian   nationality   laws   and   the
    appellant's partner's account of what the Consulate told him could  not
    be determinative of that issue.  The Upper Tribunal should be  slow  to
    find that a British child of a  Brazilian  mother  could  not  live  in
    Brazil, or, indeed, that the appellant's  partner  would  be  excluded.
    There was a public interest in deportation  of  foreign  criminals  and
    deterrence  must  be  taken   into   account.    He   relied   on   the
    proportionality guidance in MM's case.

47. For the appellant, Mr Sharma relied on his skeleton argument  (entitled
    Response to Directions).  He  addressed  the  central  findings  in  MM
    (Uganda) at [22]-[25]  and  contended  that  the  practical  effect  of
    deportation was that the citizen child might be compelled to leave  the
    United Kingdom, and the European Union.  The appellant  submitted  that
    it was not open to her to remove the  child,  and  that  there  was  no
    evidence that this child would be entitled to live with her  mother  in
    Brazil.  He reserved the right to make further oral submissions.

48. In his oral submissions, Mr Sharma said that the appellant had now been
    in the United Kingdom as an extended family member for 5 years and  had
    not been  present  unlawfully  in  the  United  Kingdom  because  as  a
    Brazilian citizen she did not require a visa.  It had always been  open
    to the respondent to grant leave to remain on  that  basis.  There  had
    been no previous visa applications and the appellant was not an  expert
    in immigration law.  The conditions in Regulation 9 were met, since the
    parties had lived together in Spain and the  centre  of  her  partner's
    life had transferred there.

49. The offence the appellant committed had been  undertaken  only  because
    she wished to assist her partner.  She had been  stupid,  but  she  had
    been influenced  and  she  had  no  previous  convictions  or  risk  of
    recidivism.  Her involvement had been very low level, as  reflected  in
    the sentence.  The appellant had not benefited at all from  her  crime;
    the scale of the overall  joint  enterprise  had  been  an  aggravating
    factor in the entencing consideration.

50. Taking Regulation 15A with Regulation 21A, it was for the respondent to
    show that the appellant's removal was conducive  to  the  public  good.
    This child would leave the  European  Union,  lose  its  links  to  its
    paternal relatives and father, and it was more likely than not that  he
    would be unable to join them in Brazil or even  visit.   The  appellant
    relied on Article 24 of the TFEU and the case  of  Abdul  at  [27]  and
    [30].  The circumstances of this case were insufficient to warrang  the
    extinction of the child's right  to  face  to  face  contact  with  its
    father, and it would be unduly harsh to separate her from one or  other
    of her parents.

Discussion

51. I reserved my decision, which I now give. The  appellant  is  a  person
    liable to deportation under section 32 and 33 of the 2007 Act. Pursuant
    to section 117C(1) of the 2002 Act, her removal  is  therefore  in  the
    public interest (section 117C(1)).  Her sentence is less than 4  years,
    so the public interest requires her deportation unless  she  can  bring
    herself within Exception 1 or Exception 2.  Exception 1 does not apply:
    the appellant has not lived lawfully in the United Kingdom for most  of
    her life. Exception 2 applies  where  the  person  has  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child (in this case,
    a child who is a British citizen,  applying  section  117D),  'and  the
    effect of deportation on the...child would be unduly harsh').

52. Article 9 of the Regulations does  not  apply  to  this  appeal  as  it
    concerns only family members  of  British  citizens  and  not  extended
    family members.   This appellant is neither married to, nor in a  civil
    partnership, with her partner.   Mr Sharma did not rely on Article 8 of
    the Regulations which deals with extended family members.  Had he  done
    so, there would now be the difficulty explained in Sala (  EFMs:  Right
    of Appeal ) [2016] UKUT 411 (IAC)   that  the  Upper  Tribunal  has  no
    jurisdiction to consider a statutory appeal  from  an  extended  family
    member.

53. Regulations 15A and  21A  are  engaged.   Regulation  15A,  so  far  as
    relevant, is as follows:

         "Derivative right of residence

         15A. (1) A person ("P") who is not an exempt person and who
         satisfies the criteria in paragraph ...(4A) ... of this regulation
         is entitled to a derivative right to reside in the United Kingdom
         for as long as P satisfies the relevant criteria. ...

         (4A) P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-

             (a)  P is the primary carer of a British citizen ("the
             relevant British citizen");

             (b)  the relevant British citizen is residing in the United
             Kingdom; and

             (c)  the relevant British citizen would be unable to reside in
             the UK or in another EEA State if P were required to leave.
             ...

         (7)  P is to be regarded as a "primary carer" of another person if

             (a)  P is a direct relative or a legal guardian of that
             person; and

             (b)  P - (i)  is the person who has primary responsibility for
                      that person's care; or

                      (ii) shares equally the responsibility for that
                      person's care with one other person who is not an
                      exempt person."

54. It is not suggested that the appellant's British partner is  an  exempt
    person.  The appellant is her daughter's mother.  She has support  from
    her unmarried partner and his family, but for such a young  child,  the
    primary responsibility is on the  mother.   I  am  satisfied  that  the
    appellant is her daughter's primary  carer.   However,  Regulation  21A
    gives the respondent the right to deny  Zambrano  derivative  residence
    where a person's removal is 'conducive to the public good'.

55. At paragraph 398, the Rules state that the  deportation  of  a  foreign
    criminal is conducive to the public good and  in  the  public  interest
    where they have been convicted of an offence for which they  have  been
    sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than  4  years  but  more
    than 12  months.   The  respondent  is  required  to  consider  whether
    paragraph 399  or  399A  applies.   If  not,  the  public  interest  in
    deportation will only be outweighed where  there  are  very  compelling
    circumstances over and above those described in paragraphs 399 or 399A.



56. In  this  appeal,  it  is  paragraph  399  which  is  applicable.   The
    appellant's daughter  is  a  British  citizen  and  is  a  minor.   The
    respondent must consider whether it would be unduly harsh  for  her  to
    remain in the United Kingdom without the appellant, or to live  in  the
    country to which the appellant is to be deported.

57. I remind myself that in Abdul (section 55 -  Article  24(3)  Charter  :
    Nigeria) [2016] UKUT 106 (IAC),  the  Upper  Tribunal  found,  applying
    Deticek v Sgueglia [2009]  EUECJ  C-403/09,  that  Article  24  of  the
    Charter of Fundamental Rights creates a free-standing fundamental,  but
    not absolute, right for a child to maintain on a regular basis personal
    relationships and direct contact with both of her parents, rather  than
    to be placed  in  a  situation  where  "family  life,  as  enjoyed  and
    experienced by the three persons involved,  would  be  decimated,  left
    hanging by the thread of occasional long distance  communications",  as
    is the case with the appellant and her son in Brazil.

58. Looking at the appeal through the  prism  of  the  Rules,  I  begin  by
    reminding myself that whether the removal of the appellant will have an
    'unduly harsh' effect on her child has to be considered in the  overall
    context, having regard also to her criminality. In MM (Uganda) & Anor v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA  Civ  617,  Lord
    Justice Laws (with whom Lord  Justice  Vos  and  Lord  Justice  Hamblen
    agreed), gave the following guidance, beginning at [22]:

         "22. I turn to the interpretation of  the  phrase  "unduly  harsh".
         Plainly it means the same  in  section  117C(5)  as  in  Rule  399.
         "Unduly harsh" is an ordinary English expression. ...

         23.  The context in these cases invites emphasis  on  two  factors,
         (1) the public interest in the removal of foreign criminals and (2)
         the need for a proportionate assessment of  any  interference  with
         Article 8 rights. ...Section 117C(2) then provides  (I  repeat  the
         provision for convenience):

             "The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal,
             the greater is the  public  interest  in  deportation  of  the
             criminal."

         24.   This  steers  the  tribunals  and   the   court   towards   a
         proportionate assessment of the criminal's deportation in any given
         case. Accordingly the more pressing  the  public  interest  in  his
         removal, the harder it will be to show that the effect on his child
         or partner will be unduly harsh. Any other approach in my  judgment
         dislocates the "unduly harsh" provisions  from  their  context.  It
         would mean that the question of undue  hardship  would  be  decided
         wholly without regard to  the  force  of  the  public  interest  in
         deportation in the particular case.  But  in  that  case  the  term
         "unduly" is mistaken for  "excessive"  which  imports  a  different
         idea. What is due or undue depends on all  the  circumstances,  not
         merely the impact on the child or partner in the given case. In the
         present  context  relevant  circumstances  certainly  include   the
         criminal's immigration and criminal history."

59. This appellant and her partner were involved in a very  serious  crime.
    The appellant's involvement may have been at a lower level than that of
    the two male perpetrators, but the sentence she received was  still  18
    months and her partner received a sentence of 4ï¿½ years.

60. The appellant has  not  produced  any  Brazilian  nationality  evidence
    before me to establish whether a Brazilian mother can return to  Brazil
    with her child, if that child is a British citizen, or indeed,  whether
    the child can derive Brazilian  citizenship  through  her  mother.   It
    would be surprising if she could not.

61.  There  is  no  documentary  corroboration  of  the  evidence  of   the
    appellant's partner that he had been told by  the  Brazilian  Consulate
    that, as a non-spouse with a criminal record, he would not be  able  to
    go to Brazil and live with her. He was not cross-examined on that.    I
    also have regard to his lack of qualifications and inability  to  speak
    Portuguese.  I approach this appeal on the basis that  the  appellant's
    partner will be unable to go to Brazil, and that she will be unable  to
    return to the United Kingdom for  at  least  10  years,  after  she  is
    deported.

62. I do not consider that it is realistic to  say  that  the  child  could
    remain with her father in the United Kingdom.  He has no  residence  or
    contact order and he has a serious criminal record.   The  evidence  to
    show that he would be permitted, or legally able to raise his  daughter
    without the appellant simply is not there. The  parties  have  not  put
    before me the amended birth certificate nor is there any evidence  that
    family Court proceedings are under way.  If the child does  not  go  to
    Brazil, Social Services may well wish to make alternative  arrangements
    for her upbringing.

63. The most likely outcome is that the appellant and the child would go to
    Brazil and the appellant's partner would remain in the United  Kingdom,
    with all of  his  extended  family.    The  support  and  affection  of
    grandparents, great-grandmother and other extended family would be lost
    to the child. If the outcome is that the appellant,  her  daughter  and
    her partner cannot continue as a family together, then as Lord  Justice
    Sedley observed in Lee v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2011] EWCA Civ 348:

         "The tragic consequence is that this family, short-lived as it  has
         been, will be broken up for ever because  of  the  appellant's  bad
         behaviour. That is what deportation does."

64. There is no satisfactory  evidence  before  me  about  the  appellant's
    extended family in Brazil:  where they live, what they do, who they are
    (except that she has her estranged father, some brothers,  and  another
    son there).  I am not satisfied that the  appellant  would  be  without
    family support to enable her to resettle in Brazil with her daughter.

65. The appellant's appeal is therefore dismissed.

Conclusions

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law. I set aside the  decision  and  remake
it by dismissing the appeal.
