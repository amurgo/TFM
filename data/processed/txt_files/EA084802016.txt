                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against the decision of Judge M  A  Khan  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (the FTT) promulgated on 5th October 2016.

 2. The Appellant is a female Sri Lankan citizen born 25th July  1975,  who
    on 4th January 2016 applied for  a  permanent  residence  card  as  the
    spouse of a German citizen, who had been exercising Treaty rights for a
    continuous period of five years in the United  Kingdom,  in  accordance
    with The Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  (the
    2006 Regulations).

 3. The Appellant explained in her application that she and her husband, to
    whom I shall refer as  the  Sponsor,  entered  the  United  Kingdom  in
    February 2009.  They have three children who are also German  citizens.
    The Sponsor had been in employment since arriving in the United Kingdom
    and therefore had been exercising Treaty rights as a worker.

 4. The Appellant had been  issued  with  residence  documentation  on  4th
    February 2011, valid until 4th February 2016, as the family  member  of
    an EEA national.

 5. The application was  refused  on  28th  June  2016  with  reference  to
    regulation 15(1)(b) and regulation 6 of the 2006 Regulations.

 6. In order to satisfy regulation 15(1)(b) the Appellant must  prove  that
    she is the family member of an EEA national  who  has  resided  in  the
    United Kingdom with the  EEA  national  in  accordance  with  the  2006
    Regulations for a continuous period  of  five  years.   The  Respondent
    noted that the Appellant claimed that the Sponsor had been a  qualified
    person as defined by regulation 6, and therefore  had  been  exercising
    Treaty rights as a worker and had  submitted  documentary  evidence  in
    support.  The Respondent noted that there was a letter from HMRC  dated
    20th January 2015 confirming the Sponsor's employment history  for  the
    tax years 2010 - 2011, 2011 - 2012, 2012 - 2013 and 2013  -  2014.   In
    addition the Appellant had submitted a P60 tax form for the Sponsor for
    the tax year ending April 2014, and payslips for months ending  October
    and November 2015.

 7. The Respondent referred to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) Primary Earnings
    Threshold (PET) which is the point at which employees must pay class  1
    national insurance contributions.   The  Respondent  followed  guidance
    known as the European Modernised Guidance which is guidance  issued  to
    caseworkers  dealing  with  the  EEA  Regulations  and  EEA   residence
    applications.  This indicated that if an EEA national was earning below
    the PET, further enquiries must be made as to  whether  the  employment
    relied upon is genuine and effective.

 8. In order to be classed as a worker, the employment must be genuine  and
    effective and not marginal or supplementary.

 9. The Respondent noted that the Sponsor's earnings were below the PET for
    the tax years 2011 - 2012 and 2012 - 2013.  The Sponsor's earnings were
    �5,824 and �7,171 respectively.

10. In the absence of any other evidence, the Respondent's  view  was  that
    the Sponsor's claimed employment for  these  years,  was  marginal  and
    auxiliary or supplementary, and therefore  the  Sponsor  could  not  be
    considered to be a worker for those years, which meant that he had  not
    accrued a continuous period of five years exercising Treaty rights.

11. The Respondent noted that the burden of proof was on the Appellant, and
    contended that the burden had not been discharged.

12. The Appellant appealed to  the  FTT,  requesting  that  the  appeal  be
    decided on the papers without an oral hearing.

13. The FTT considered the appeal on the papers as requested and  issued  a
    decision dated 25th  September  2016,  which  was  promulgated  on  5th
    October 2016, allowing the appeal.

14. The Appellant did not appreciate that the appeal had been  allowed  and
    applied for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

15. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Nightingale of the FTT and  I
    set out below in part, the grant of  permission  which  summarises  the
    Appellant's grounds;

         "2.  The 'grounds' are a letter from the Appellant  simply  stating
             that she leaves matters in the hands of the Tribunal and  that
             she is entitled to a permanent residence card.

         3.   The judge considered the Appellant's case and noted some  gaps
             in the evidence at paragraph 21.  At paragraph  19  the  judge
             states that the Appellant has not shown she has resided for  a
             continuous period of five years, yet at paragraph 23 says that
             she has met the  requirements  of  regulation  15(1)(b).   The
             judge does not appear to accept that the spouse's  periods  of
             study are to be taken into consideration, and also  notes  the
             evidence does not cover the required period (at paragraph 21).
              The findings of the judge are entirely unclear, and the basis
             upon which this appeal was allowed is equally unclear.  Whilst
             there are  no  arguable  errors  arising  on  the  Appellant's
             Grounds of Appeal, I find there to be obvious  errors  arising
             on the face of the judge's decision and permission is  granted
             on this basis."

16. Following the grant of permission the Respondent submitted  a  response
    pursuant to Rule 24 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008, agreeing with the grant of permission.  The Respondent  confessed
    to misunderstanding the FTT decision, believing the appeal to have been
    dismissed, commenting that this was indicative of  a  lack  of  clarity
    within the FTT decision.

17. Directions were issued making provision  for  there  to  be  a  hearing
    before the  Upper  Tribunal  to  ascertain  whether  the  FTT  decision
    contained an error of law such that it should be set aside.

Error of Law

18. The Appellant attended without  legal  representation.   I  established
    that there was no difficulty in communication between the Appellant and
    interpreter in Tamil.  The Appellant indicated that she was content  to
    proceed without legal representation.

19. I explained  the  procedure  that  would  be  adopted.   The  Appellant
    indicated that she had applied for permission to appeal, as she had not
    understood the FTT decision.

20. The Appellant had seen the grant of permission and understood that  the
    Respondent believed that the  FTT  had  made  an  error  of  law.   The
    Appellant did not wish to comment further upon the FTT decision.

21. Mrs Aboni relied upon the Rule 24 response, submitting that the FTT had
    materially erred in law.  The findings are unclear and contradictory.

22. I set aside the decision of the FTT.  The  decision  contains  material
    errors of law.  At paragraph 19 the FTT finds that  the  Appellant  has
    not shown that she has resided in the United Kingdom for  a  continuous
    period of five years in accordance with  the  2006  Regulations.   This
    conflicts with the conclusion at paragraph 21 that "the  Appellant  has
    provided more than sufficient evidence to show that  her  EEA  national
    family member is exercising Treaty rights in the UK."  At paragraph  22
    the FTT  finds  that  the  Appellant  "has  not  provided  evidence  of
    insurance and medical cover.  The Appellant also  falls  short  in  the
    time period required, from 2010 until 2015."  This finding is  unclear.
    The FTT makes reference to the Appellant having been studying with  the
    Open University.  The Appellant at the Upper Tribunal indicated that it
    was her daughter who had been studying with the Open University.

23. Paragraph 23 contains another conflicting finding,  in  this  paragraph
    the FTT makes a finding that the Appellant  has  established  that  she
    satisfies  the  requirement  of  regulation  15(1)(b)   of   the   2006
    Regulations.

24. I set aside the decision of the FTT with no findings preserved,  I  was
    asked by the Appellant and Mrs Aboni to re-make the decision.

Re-Making the Decision

25. Mrs Aboni submitted that the decision should be re-made and the  appeal
    dismissed for the reasons given in the Respondent's reasons for refusal
    letter dated 28th June 2016.

26. The Appellant explained that she and the Sponsor  came  to  the  United
    Kingdom on 11th February 2009.  The Sponsor is a German citizen.   They
    have three children who are also German citizens, a daughter age 21,  a
    daughter age 12, and a son age 10.

27. The Sponsor had employment in excess of five years  after  arriving  in
    the United Kingdom.  He is currently working for the Appellant who  has
    opened a restaurant.  This business started in February 2016.

28. The Appellant confirmed that the Sponsor had worked continuously  since
    coming to the United Kingdom, working for approximately  twelve  months
    in a shop, and the remainder of the time  in  a  petrol  station.   The
    Appellant requested that she be  granted  permanent  residence  on  the
    basis that she had a residence card valid between 4th February 2011 and
    4th February 2016, and the Sponsor had been  in  continuous  employment
    for over five years.

29. I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

30. In re-making the decision I have taken into account  the  documentation
    placed before the FTT.  This comprises  the  Respondent's  bundle  with
    Annexes A - G, together with the Appellant's Notice of Appeal.

31. The burden of proof is on the Appellant and the  standard  of  proof  a
    balance of probabilities.  I find as a fact that the Appellant and  her
    family have resided in the United Kingdom since February 2009.  I  have
    seen a copy of her residence documentation which was valid between  4th
    February 2011 and 4th February 2016.

32. It is common ground that the Sponsor is a German citizen.

33. The  evidence  produced  to  the  Respondent  to  prove  the  Sponsor's
    employment is a letter from HMRC dated 20 January 2015  which  confirms
    his employment for a period of four years, those being  the  tax  years
    2010 - 2011, 2011 - 2012, 2012 - 2013, and 2013 -  2014.   In  addition
    payslips for the months October 2015 and November 2015  were  produced,
    showing that the Sponsor's employment continued as  his  annual  income
    shown on the payslip dated 30th November 2015 was �4,846.60.

34. The Sponsor's annual income could fairly  be  described  as  low.   The
    application form submitted by the  Appellant  in  connection  with  her
    permanent residence application confirms the Sponsor  receives  housing
    benefit in the sum of �360 per month,  and  tax  credits  of  �710  per
    month.  This is has not been disputed by the Respondent.

35. The Respondent's reasons for refusal letter does not dispute  that  the
    Sponsor has been in employment, but contends that in two  years,  those
    being 2011 - 2012, and 2012 - 2013 his earnings were below the PET.  On
    that basis his employment was deemed to be marginal  and  auxiliary  or
    supplementary for those years, and it was  not  accepted  that  he  had
    employment which made him a qualified person.

36.  The  Respondent  in  the  refusal   letter   referred   to   Levin   v
    Staatssecretaris van Justitie [1982]  EUECJ  R-53/8  which  provides  a
    definition of employment.  In summary it was found that part-time  work
    counts as employment, provided the work  is  genuine  and  provides  an
    effective means for a person to earn a  living  even  if  needs  to  be
    supplemented from public funds.

37. In Lawrie-Blum v Land Baden-Wurttemberg Case 66/85 [1986] ECR  2121  it
    was  found  that  the  essential  characteristic  of   the   employment
    relationship is the fact that during a given time one  person  provides
    services  for  and  under  the  direction  of  another  in  return  for
    remuneration.

38. The case law indicates that remuneration appears to  be  the  key,  but
    payment need not be enough to live on, or it may be in kind rather than
    a formal wage.  In Kempf v Staatssecretaris van  Justitie  Case  139/85
    [1986] ECL 1741, it was found that a person may still be a worker  even
    if their pay is so low that he or  she  needs  to  supplement  it  with
    unemployment benefit or has to apply  for  sickness  benefit  during  a
    period of illness, provided that the effectiveness and  genuineness  of
    the activities of the person are established.

39. If the work is genuine and  effective,  and  not  purely  marginal  and
    incidental therefore, it can be considered an economic activity.

40. It is accepted that the Sponsor has been in employment.   It  is  clear
    that his income has been supplemented by tax credits.   I  accept  that
    the Sponsor's wage was used to support himself and his family.  In  the
    circumstances I do not find that his employment  can  be  described  as
    purely marginal and incidental, and I accept that it  has  been  proved
    that the employment is genuine and effective, even though lowly paid.

41. I therefore find that the Appellant has proved that  she  is  a  family
    member of an EEA national who has resided in the  United  Kingdom  with
    the EEA  national  in  accordance  with  the  2006  Regulations  for  a
    continuous period  of  five  years.   The  requirements  of  regulation
    15(1)(b) are satisfied and the appeal is  allowed.   The  Appellant  is
    entitled to permanent residence in the United Kingdom.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the FTT contained material errors of law and was set  aside.
 I substitute a fresh decision.  The appeal is allowed pursuant to the  2006
Regulations.

Anonymity

There has been no request for anonymity  and  I  see  no  need  to  make  an
anonymity order.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Because the appeal is allowed I  have  considered  whether  to  make  a  fee
award.  In my view sufficient information was  provided  to  the  Respondent
with the application.  I therefore make a fee award in the sum of �80.
