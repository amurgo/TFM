                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 15th August 1952.  He
       is the father of Mr Muhammad Farhan  Asghar  who  is  a  citizen  of
       Pakistan born on 27th December 1984. Mr Asghar  is  married  to  Mrs
       Hanna Josefin Goransson, who is  a  Swedish  citizen  born  on  20th
       December 1984. Mr Asghar and Mrs  Goransson  were  married  on  15th
       March 2011 and have a son together. The appellant,  Mr  Asghar,  Mrs
       Gorannson and their son all live at the same address.

    2. The appellant arrived in the UK on 21st May 2004. He applied  for  a
       residence card as the family member of Mr Asghar and  Mrs  Goransson
       in September 2012. This application was refused on 11th  April  2013
       on the basis that  he  had  not  provided  the  relevant  birth  and
       marriage certificates to show he  was  related  as  claimed  to  Mrs
       Goransson.

    3. His appeal against the decision was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal
       Judge CJE Nicholls in a determination promulgated on the  2nd  April
       2014. The respondent conceded that the appellant was related to  his
       son as claimed and that his son was married to  Mrs  Goransson,  and
       that this placed him with the definition at  Regulation  7(1)(c)  of
       the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.   Judge  Nicholls  dismissed
       the appeal because he found that the appellant was, on the facts  of
       the case, dependent on Mr Asghar but not on his EEA daughter-in-law,
       Mrs Goransson.

    4. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Simpson on 15th May 2014 on the basis that it was arguable that  the
       First-tier Tribunal had erred in law in finding it was necessary for
       there to be some dependency on the EEA national rather than  on  the
       non-EEA national son.

    5. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law.

Submissions

    6. At the start of the hearing I asked Mr Parkinson if he accepted that
       there was an error given the wording of Regulation  7(1)(c)  of  the
       Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 (as clearly  the  respondent  had
       become confused with Regulation 8 (2) in the Rule 24 notice) but  he
       said that he maintained that Judge Nicholls' approach was lawful  as
       there must be some degree of dependency on the EEA national  and  in
       the unusual facts of this case there was none. He believed that  Jia
       (Free movement of persons) [2007] EUECJ -  C-1/05  at  paragraph  40
       supported this view. Whilst Judge Nicholls had  found  a  connection
       between the appellant and the EEA national  in  that  the  appellant
       provided childcare for the EEA national's child  there  was  not  an
       interconnected family as was needed,  see  Lim  (EEA  -  dependency)
       Malaysia [2013] UKUT  437,  and  there  was  no  evidence  that  the
       childcare provided was important to the EEA national.

    7. Mr Plowright submitted that he did not believe Jia was authority for
       this proposition, particularly if taken with the two cases of  Reyes
       v Migrationsverket (Directive 2004/38/EC)  Case C-423/12  and  Reyes
       (EEA Regs: dependency) [2013] UKUT 00314. Once  Judge  Nicholls  had
       found the appellant to be a dependent of Mrs Goransson's spouse,  as
       he does at paragraph 17 of his determination, that was  the  end  of
       the matter under  Regulation  7(1)(c  )  of  the  Immigration  (EEA)
       Regulations 2006. All the other findings were irrelevant. If the EEA
       national moves to another  EEA  state,  as  is  speculated  upon  at
       paragraph 23 of the  determination,  then  clearly  her  husband  Mr
       Asghar and son would go too, and so therefore would  the  appellant.
       Thus it was also wrong to suggest that the appellant was not part of
       the exercise of Treaty rights by Mrs Goransson.

Conclusions: Error of Law

    8. The  wording  of  Regulation  7(1)  (c)  of  the  Immigration  (EEA)
       Regulations 2006 is clear. The appellant is a family member if he is
       the dependent relative in the ascending line of the EEA or  the  EEA
       national's spouse. At paragraph 35 of Jia it is states  as  follows:
       "According to the case-law of the Court, the status  of  "dependent"
       family member is the result of a factual situation characterised  by
       the fact that material support for the family member is provided  by
       the Community national who has exercised his right of free  movement
       or by his spouse (see, in relation to Article 10  of  Regulation  No
       1612/68 and Article 1 of Council Directive 90/364/ EEC  of  28  June
       1990 on the  fight  or  residence  (OJ  1990  L  180,  p26),  Lebon,
       paragraph 22  and  Case  C-200/02  Zhu  and  Chen  [2004]  ECR1-9925
       paragraph 43, respectively)." The case then considers in detail what
       dependency might mean, but starts clearly  from  the  position  that
       this "material support" can be provided by the EEA national  or  the
       spouse. This position is also confirmed at paragraph 43 of Jia where
       it is stated that the: "material support of that Community  national
       or his or her spouse in order to  meet  their  essential  needs"  is
       required.  Paragraph 35 of Jia is cited again  at  paragraph  17  of
       Reyes (EEA Regs: dependency); again  at  paragraph  21  of  Reyes  v
       Migrationsverket; and again at paragraph 16 of Lim (EEA- dependency)
       Malaysia [2013] UKUT 437.

    9.  I find it is clear therefore that dependency on the EEA  national's
       spouse suffices to meet the requirements of  Regulation  7(1)(c)  of
       the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006. I therefore find that  Judge
       Nicholls erred in law in requiring dependency of  the  appellant  on
       Mrs Gorannson when he had satisfied himself that the  appellant  met
       the definition of a  dependent  in  relationship  to  Mr  Ashgar  at
       paragraphs 20 and 24 of the determination.

Conclusions: Re-making

   10. Judge Nicholls found that the appellant was financially dependent on
       his son Mr Ashgar; and also had social and emotional ties with  him;
       and that he cares for his grandson as both his son, Mr  Ashgar,  and
       his son's wife, Mrs Goransson, work. He found that  this  dependency
       was genuine in accordance with the case law  providing  guidance  on
       this issue, namely Reyes (EEA Regs: dependency) and Jia.  There  was
       no allegation or evidence that this was a situation characterised as
       an abuse of rights. Judge Nicholls was satisfied that Mr Ashgar  and
       Mrs Goransson were married (and indeed were not estranged, lived  in
       the same household and had a young child).  He  was  also  satisfied
       that Mrs Goransson was a qualified  person  as  a  Swedish  national
       exercising Treaty rights  as  a  worker  as  a  branch  manager  for
       bookmakers William Hill, thereby  satisfying  Regulation  6  of  the
       Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006. The respondent had conceded that
       the appellant was Mr Ashgar's father and  that  Mr  Ashgar  and  Mrs
       Goransson are lawfully married.

   11. In such circumstances  I  find  that  appellant  is  entitled  to  a
       residence card under  Regulation  17(1)  of  the  Immigration  (EEA)
       Regulations 2006 as he is the family member of a  qualified  person,
       under Regulations 7(1)(c) of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.



Decision

   12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  an
       error on a point of law.

   13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

   14. The decision is re-made allowing the appeal.

Fee Award

    In the light of my decision to re-make the decision in  the  appeal  by
    allowing it, I have considered whether to make a fee  award  (rule  23A
    (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005
    and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
    2007). I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee
    Awards in Immigration Appeals (December  2011).  The  evidence  showing
    dependency would appear, in large part at least, to have been submitted
    at the appeal  stage  in  this  case,  and  no  submissions  were  made
    requesting  a  fee  award  on  behalf  of  the  appellant.   In   these
    circumstances I do not find it appropriate to make a fee award.
