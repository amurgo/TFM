                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. This is an appeal brought by the  appellant  against  the  decision  of
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Walters,  promulgated  on  5  March   2014
    following a hearing at Taylor House on  10  February  2014  whereby  he
    dismissed the appellant's appeal against the respondent's  decision  to
    remove him to Romania pursuant to Section 10  of  the  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 1999 as a person who does not have or has ceased to  have  a
    right to reside in the UK.  The basis of this  decision  was  that  the
    appellant had failed to show that he was a qualified person entitled to
    reside  in  this  country  in  accordance  with  Regulation  6  of  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

 2.  Within  that  Regulation  a  "qualified  person"  is  defined   within
    Regulation 6(1) as including "(b)  a  worker".   In  his  determination
    Judge Walters acknowledged that the  appellant  had  produced  sets  of
    photographs which showed him doing roofing, brickwork  and  tiling  and
    making driveways  amongst  other  tasks  and  as  the  judge  found  at
    paragraph 13, "he produced two sets  of  photographs  which,  I  found,
    clearly showed him undertaking these tasks".  He also accepted that  he
    had been paying his national insurance contributions.  As the judge put
    it at paragraph 18 of  his  determination,  "I  found  that  there  was
    adequate  evidence  that  the  appellant  had  been   paying   his   NI
    contributions".

 3. However, the judge was not prepared to accept that he  was  a  "worker"
    for the purpose of these Regulations for reasons which he  set  out  at
    paragraph 18 of his determination as follows:

         "I found that in order to prove that one  is  a  worker,  one  must
         prove that one is in legitimate employment,  paying  the  requisite
         income tax and national insurance (NI).  [Although]  I  found  that
         there was adequate evidence that the appellant had been paying  his
         NI contributions, [there was] no evidence whatsoever  that  he  had
         been paying income tax.  I therefore did not find  that  he  was  a
         worker".

 4. Before me, on behalf of the respondent, Mr  Jarvis  accepted  that  the
    definition of worker that the  judge  was  adopting  here  was  not  in
    accordance with the Regulations and nor was it in accordance  with  the
    decision of this Tribunal in Begum (EEA - worker - jobseeker)  Pakistan
    [2011] UKUT 00275.

 5. There was a  further  difficulty  in  this  case  in  that  it  is  the
    appellant's case as set out in  his  grounds  of  appeal  that  he  had
    submitted evidence to the Tribunal which either was not  considered  by
    the judge or which had not been put before him.  As the judge does  not
    state within his determination (and it would have been preferable if he
    had) just what evidence was before him  it  cannot  be  said  with  any
    certainty precisely what evidence he had.  It  is  certainly  the  case
    that the appellant did say that he had been  working  and  he  produced
    evidence such as the photographs of the  work  he  was  doing  and  the
    evidence relating to his national insurance which supported this.

 6. Before me the appellant also produced evidence in the form  of  a  Post
    Office receipt dated 29 January 2014 which was some  two  weeks  or  so
    prior to the hearing before Judge Walters from  which  it  is  apparent
    that he posted a substantial body of documents  to  the  respondent  at
    Angel Square.  It is accordingly in my judgment more  likely  than  not
    that he did submit documents to the Tribunal as he says  and  it  would
    appear that not only did the judge make a  material  error  of  law  in
    considering what was a "worker" in the way that he did but there was  a
    procedural irregularity in the proceedings such  as  to  amount  to  an
    error of law.  After considering the documents which were  provided  by
    the appellant for this hearing Mr Jarvis on behalf  of  the  respondent
    very fairly accepted that there was sufficient evidence to suggest that
    there probably had been a procedural irregularity and  he  also,  as  I
    have noted above, accepted that Judge Walters' definition  of  "worker"
    for the purposes of these Regulations was simply wrong.  Accordingly  I
    now have to remake the decision and I shall do so shortly.   Before  so
    doing, however,  it  is  right  that  I  make  some  reference  to  the
    underlying reason  why  in  this  case  the  respondent  considered  it
    appropriate to make a decision to remove this appellant  on  the  basis
    that he was not a qualifying person because this is an unusual decision
    to make.

 7. The unpleasant fact in this case is that since arriving in this country
    this appellant has been convicted of  what  this  Tribunal  regards  as
    serious criminal offences in that he has no less than three convictions
    for driving with excess alcohol while uninsured and associated offences
    such as failing to surrender to custody at that point in time and  also
    driving whilst disqualified.  The offences were considered  so  serious
    that in respect  of  two  of  them  he  was  sentenced  to  periods  of
    imprisonment.  That, however, as the judge acknowledged at the  hearing
    in front of the First-tier Tribunal, is  not  strictly  relevant  to  a
    consideration of whether or not the appellant is a qualified person for
    the purposes of the Regulations but it does explain why if he  was  not
    the respondent considered it appropriate to remove him.  I  should  add
    that the appellant has not been in the country for a sufficient  length
    of time to have acquired any permanent  right  of  residence  here  and
    unless his behaviour improves it may  well  be  that  subsequently  the
    respondent will have no alternative other than to decide to remove  him
    in compliance with Regulation 21 of the 2006 Regulations.  That said  I
    now turn to remake the decision.  Again, although this is not  strictly
    relevant to the decision it is perhaps appropriate to record that, even
    were this appellant now to be removed, unless he is removed for reasons
    and in a way which would bar his subsequent return the only  effect  of
    removal would be that he would suffer the inconvenience  of  having  to
    get on a train or bus or boat back  into  this  country  because  there
    would not appear to be any  restriction  on  his  so  doing.   However,
    again, this is not strictly relevant to the decision.

 8. Again, with commendable  fairness  Mr  Jarvis,  having  considered  the
    material produced by the appellant at this  hearing  which  included  a
    document showing that he has actually paid some national insurance  and
    also the Inland Revenue returns which were submitted which showed  that
    in a seven month period up until April 2013  he  had  earned  something
    over �8,000 but had not had to pay any tax because after  his  expenses
    had been taken into account his taxable income was only  around  �5,500
    or so for the year, accepted that the appellant was indeed  a  "worker"
    and thus a qualified person for the  purpose  of  the  Regulations.   I
    would merely add that Judge Walters in his determination without  being
    specific as to the figures he had in mind had attempted to dismiss  the
    appellant's account on the basis that if he had been working as long as
    he said he was he should have earned sufficient money to pay income tax
    and so the fact that he did not showed that his figures  could  not  be
    believed.  Judge Walters did not apparently take account  of  the  fact
    that he only worked for seven months or so in the year ending  5  April
    2013 and also that before his earnings were calculated he would have to
    deduct those expenses which legitimately could be  deducted.   Although
    not high I do not consider that receipts of �8,500  in  a  seven  month
    period, as is shown on his tax returns, are so low as to show that  his
    figures cannot be trusted.  As Mr Jarvis accepts that the appellant was
    a worker for the purposes of the Regulations and I agree  that  on  the
    evidence this is established  it  follows  that  this  appeal  must  be
    allowed and I so find.

Decision

I set aside the determination of the First-tier Tribunal and substitute  the
following decision:

The appellant's appeal is allowed under the 2006 EEA Regulations.
