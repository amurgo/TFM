                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction

 1. The appellants  are  all  citizens  of  India.  The  first  and  second
    appellants are husband and wife, and they are the parents of the  third
    appellant, who was born in July 2006.

 2. The appellants appeal with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Richardson ("the judge"), promulgated  on  14  June
    2019, in which  she  dismissed  the  appellants'  appeals  against  the
    respondent's decision of 29 January 2019, refusing their  human  rights
    claim.

 3. The first appellant arrived in the  United  Kingdom  in  possession  of
    entry clearance as a Tier 4 student on 15 April  2011,  accompanied  by
    the second appellant. The third appellant arrived on 5  November  2013,
    having  remained  in  India  with  grandparents  after   his   parents'
    departure. On 4 February 2015, the first appellant was served  with  an
    IS151A Notice, curtailing her leave to remain on the basis that she had
    allegedly used deception in obtaining a  TOEIC  English  language  test
    certificate, which she had used in application made to  the  respondent
    on 9 August 2012. From this point onwards, the appellants have remained
    in the United Kingdom without leave.

 4. Following the judgment of the Court  of  Appeal  in  Ahsan  and  Others
    [2017] EWCA Civ 2009; [2018] Imm AR 531, the appellants made a combined
    human rights claim, the refusal of which led to the appeals before  the
    First-tier Tribunal. The respondent's decision relied in large part  on
    the previous allegation of deception against the first appellant,  with
    reference to the  well-known  ETS  issues.  In  light  of  the  alleged
    deception and the circumstances as a whole,  the  respondent  concluded
    that the appellants could not satisfy  any  of  the  Article  8-related
    Immigration Rules ("the Rules") or on a wider basis.



The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 5. Having considered the evidence before her, the judge concluded at  [52]
    that the first  appellant  had  not  in  fact  practised  deception  in
    obtaining and then relying on the English language test certificate.

 6. The judge went on to consider Article  8  in  some  detail,  concluding
    that:

              i. there would be no "very significant obstacles" to the first
                 and second appellant's ability to reintegrate  into  Indian
                 society;

             ii. the first and second appellants  could  not  succeed  under
                 Article 8 on any other basis;

            iii. the third appellant was progressing  well  at  school,  was
                 well-settled socially, and spoke English and Punjabi;

             iv. the third appellant was not a "qualifying  child"  for  the
                 purposes of paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) of the Rules or section
                 117B(6) of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
                 2002, as amended ("the 2002 Act");

              v. whilst the third appellant's best interests may have rested
                 in  him  remaining  in  the  United  Kingdom,  the  overall
                 circumstances of the case indicated that it  would  not  be
                 disproportionate for him to  leave  this  country  together
                 with his parents.

 7. On this basis, the appeals were dismissed.



The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 8. Although two grounds of appeal were set  out  in  the  application  for
    permission, in truth they make a single assertion, namely  that  having
    found that the first appellant had not been dishonest, the  judge  then
    failed to take this highly relevant factor into account when  assessing
    the Article 8 claims. Under ground 2, it is said that the judge  failed
    to have regard to the respondent's concession made before the Court  of
    Appeal in Khan and Others [2018] EWCA Civ 1684; [2019] Imm  AR  54.  At
    para 37 of the judgment, it is recorded that:

           "Nonetheless, for the avoidance  of  doubt,  the  SSHD  confirms
           that:

           (i) For those individuals whose leave was curtailed,  and  where
           that leave would still have time to run as at the date of an FTT
           determination that  there  was  no  deception,  subject  to  any
           further appeal to the UT,  the  curtailment  decision  would  be
           withdrawn and the effect ... would be that leave would  continue
           and the individuals would not be  disadvantaged  in  any  future
           application they chose to make;

           (ii) For those whose leave has been  curtailed,  and  where  the
           leave would in  any  event  have  expired  without  any  further
           application being made, the Respondent will  provide  a  further
           opportunity  for  the  individuals  to  obtain  leave  with  the
           safeguards in paragraph (iii) below.

           For those whose leave had expired, and who had made an  in  time
           application for further leave to remain which was refused on ETS
           grounds, the effect of an FTT determination that  there  was  no
           deception would be that the  refusal  would  be  withdrawn.  The
           applicant  in  question  would   still   have   an   outstanding
           application for leave to remain and the Respondent will  provide
           them with a reasonable opportunity to make any  further  changes
           to their application which would be considered on the  basis  of
           them not having employed any deception in the obtaining of their
           TOEIC certificate, and they would in no way be disadvantaged  in
           any future application they chose to make.

           (iii) In all cases, the Respondent confirms that in  making  any
           future decision he will not  hold  any  previous  gap  in  leave
           caused by any erroneous decision in relation to ETS against  the
           relevant applicant, and will have to take into account  all  the
           circumstances of each case."

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Designated Judge of the  First-tier
    Tribunal Shaerf on 6 January 2020.




The respondent's Rule 24 response

10. In a Rule 24 response dated 30 January 2020, the  respondent  confirmed
    that she was not challenging the  judge's  conclusion  that  the  first
    appellant had not been dishonest in respect  of  the  English  language
    test certificate. The following paragraph reads as follows:

           "That being the case and taking  into  account  the  immigration
           history set out  at  [1]-[11]  [of  the  judge's  decision]  the
           Tribunal is invited to allow the appeal to  the  limited  extent
           that the Respondent will grant the Appellant a period  of  leave
           to remain for 60 days as indicated  in  Khan  &  Others  v  SSHD
           [2018] EWCA Civ 1684 in order to be put back into  the  position
           she was in, prior to the curtailment  of  leave  on  4  February
           2015."



The hearing

11. Ms Jaquiss confirmed that she was aware of the  respondent's  position,
    but submitted (both orally and through her skeleton argument) that  the
    "offer" of 60 days' leave to remain was not an adequate remedy for  the
    erroneous curtailment of the first  appellant's'  leave  to  remain  in
    2015. What she described as this "historic injustice" and  the  "delay"
    caused  by  the   respondent's   actions   required   something   more,
    specifically a grant of leave  in  line  with  the  normal  30  months'
    following a successful Article 8 appeal. She asked us to make  specific
    findings  relating  to  the  family  unit,  in  particular  the   third
    appellant.

12. Mr Kandola submitted that the allegation of deception had not  amounted
    to an abuse of process and was not a "historic injustice". He submitted
    that the erroneous allegation of deception had not caused prejudice  to
    the appellants. In light of the Rule 24 response, he  did  accept  that
    the erroneous allegation constituted a "compelling  circumstance"  such
    as to permit the appellants to succeed on Article 8 grounds outside the
    context of the relevant Rules.



Decision on error of law

13. We conclude that the judge materially erred in law by failing  to  take
    account of her finding that the first appellant had not been  dishonest
    when considering the Article 8 claims. This failure related both to the
    respondent's concession set  out  in  Khan  and  Others  (as  has  been
    acknowledged by the respondent in the Rule 24 response),  but  also  in
    respect of the wider Article 8 balancing exercise.

14. We therefore set the judge's decision aside.



Remaking decision

15. It was clearly appropriate for us to go on and remake the  decision  in
    these appeals for ourselves. In so doing, we have  had  regard  to  the
    evidence before us, although it is  right  to  say  that  there  is  no
    material dispute as to the essential facts. The immigration history  is
    as set out in paras 3-4, above. The appellants all speak perfectly good
    English and have been, as far as we are aware, financially  independent
    throughout their residence  in  this  country.  They  are  all  healthy
    individuals. It is likely that the first  and  second  appellants  have
    formed ties here over the course of time.

16. As regards the third appellant, we find that he is currently in Year  9
    at school and we have no reason to doubt that he continues to  do  well
    there. It is  perhaps  unsurprising,  and  we  so  find,  that  he  has
    established good social ties in this country since his arrival in 2013.
    In light of what is said in the  first  appellant's  witness  statement
    contained in the bundle prepared for the First-tier  Tribunal  hearing,
    we accept that the third appellant has  formed  solid  friendships  and
    participates in extra-curricular activities. All-told, we would  assess
    his best interests as  not  only  being  with  his  parents,  but  also
    remaining in the United Kingdom.

17. There has been no challenge to the judge's conclusion  that  the  first
    and second appellants would not face "very  significant  obstacles"  to
    their reintegration into Indian society. Nothing has  been  brought  to
    our attention which should disturb that conclusion, and  we  adopt  it.
    The first and second  appellants  are  unable  to  rely  on  any  other
    provision of the Article 8-related Rules.

18. The third appellant is not a "qualifying child"  for  the  purposes  of
    section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act  and  paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv)  of  the
    Rules, as he has only resided in the United Kingdom for 6 years  and  3
    months.

19. We take into account the third appellant's best interests as a  primary
    consideration.

20. We have specific regard to the mandatory considerations set  out  under
    section 117B of the  2002  Act.  The  English  language  and  financial
    independence factors are of neutral effect in this  case.  The  private
    lives of the appellants would in the ordinary course of events  attract
    "little weight", as they have been in this country without leave  since
    early 2015. However, a degree of flexibility is built into the  "little
    weight" criterion (see para 36 of Rhuppiah [2018] UKSC 58; [2018] 1 WLR
    5536).

21. In the present case, there exists a highly significant feature relevant
    to the  appellants'  private  lives,  accepted  by  the  respondent  as
    constituting  a  sufficiently  "compelling  circumstance"  to  tip  the
    balance in their favour. That feature  is  the  respondent's  erroneous
    allegation of deception against the first appellant and the  consequent
    curtailment of her previous leave to remain.

22. There is no reason for us to go behind the respondent's  concession  as
    set out in the Rule 24 response. It is entirely  in  keeping  with  the
    position adopted before the Court of Appeal in Khan and Others. On this
    basis, we conclude that the respondent's  refusal  of  the  appellants'
    human rights  claim  did  not  strike  a  fair  balance  between  their
    protected rights and the public interest, and that  it  is  accordingly
    unlawful under section 6 of the Human  Rights  Act  1998.  The  appeals
    therefore fall to be allowed.

23. We add the following observations. First, whilst the Rule  24  response
    requested that we allow the appeal to the  "limited  extent"  that  the
    respondent would grant the appellants 60 days'  leave  to  remain,  the
    Upper Tribunal has no power to allow any appeal to a "limited  extent":
    an appeal is either allowed or dismissed.

24. Second, we do not accept Ms Jaquiss' categorisation of the respondent's
    erroneous allegation of deception against  the  first  appellant  as  a
    "historic injustice". Unlike, for example, the situation facing  former
    Gurkha soldiers, cases such as  the  present  are  not  concerned  with
    rights to settlement. Nor can it properly be said that  the  allegation
    involved an abuse of power or any other illegality.

25. Third, we also take  issue  with  the  description  of  the  compelling
    feature in this case  as  one  of  "delay".  In  truth,  there  was  no
    particular delay on the respondent's part when making  the  (erroneous)
    decision in February 2015, nor has there been any tardiness thereafter.
    Further, the allegation of deception was clearly not  indicative  of  a
    dysfunctional or arbitrary system operated by  the  respondent  at  the
    material time. Thus, none of the species of delay  referred  to  in  EB
    (Kosovo) [2008] UKHL 41; [2008] 3 WLR 178 and relied on by Ms  Jaquiss,
    apply here.

26. Fourth, whilst we can appreciate the appellants' desire to  be  granted
    as long a period of leave to remain as possible, that decision is not a
    matter for us. We are not endorsing the respondent's current view  that
    60 days is appropriate, nor do we say that  a  full  30  months  should
    necessarily follow from our decision.




Anonymity

27. Although the First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction,
    we have concluded that one is nonetheless appropriate because of the
    presence of a minor child in these proceedings and the need to protect
    him from being identified.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

We set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

We remake the decision by allowing the appeals.
