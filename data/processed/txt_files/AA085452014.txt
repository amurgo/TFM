Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr B Akinbade, instructed by Moorhouse Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, BC, date of birth 24.9.75, is a citizen of Zimbabwe.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Handley promulgated 27.1.15, dismissing his appeal against the decision
    of the respondent, dated 30.9.14, to refuse  his  asylum,  humanitarian
    protection and human rights claims.  The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    27.11.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Denson  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    24.2.15, in respect of the article 8 claim only.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 28.5.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein, I find that there was no error  of  law
    in the making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  such  as  to
    required the decision of Judge Handley to be set aside.

 6. In granting permission  to  appeal,  Judge  Denson  stated,  in  rather
    strident terms, that there was an arguable error of law in the decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal, stating, "The  judge  in  his  decision  in
    dismissing the appellant's appeal under article 8 of  the  ECHR  wholly
    failed to consider the  appellant's  claim  under  article  8  and  the
    findings, reasons and decision by the  judge  is  totally  and  utterly
    inadequate  in  relation  to  the  appellant's  claim  and  under   the
    circumstances I find that there is most certainly an arguable error  of
    law in  relation  to  the  judge's  findings  in  connection  with  the
    appellant's article 8 claim  and  permission  to  appeal  is  therefore
    granted in relation to the appellant's article 8 claim only."

 7. In his submissions, supported by his  skeleton  argument,  Mr  Akinbade
    repeatedly asserted that Judge Handley had made  factual  errors  which
    were material to the article 8 assessment. However, when I asked him to
    specify these errors he was unable to point me to anything  other  than
    what amounted  to  a  disagreement  with  the  findings.  For  example,
    reliance was placed on �38 of the decision where the judge doubted  the
    nature of the appellant's claimed  relationship  with  a  partner.  The
    judge stated that it was clear from the  evidence  that  the  appellant
    meets her only occasionally and only  on  two  occasions  in  2014.  Mr
    Akinbade  submitted  that  this  was  inconsistent  with  �27  of   the
    appellant's witness statement, where he alleged  that  he  visited  his
    girlfriend frequently and was in regular contact with her, and provided
    an explanation for the reduced visiting in 2014. This does not disclose
    an error of law. Certainly, the oral  evidence  of  the  appellant  was
    inconsistent with his witness statement and he has given an explanation
    of sorts as to why he only visited her  twice  in  2014.  However,  the
    record of the appellant's evidence to the Tribunal  is  not  challenged
    and  it  was  open  to  the  judge  to  conclude  that  they  met  only
    occasionally.

 8. Similar considerations arise in respect of the  other  claimed  factual
    errors in the  decision  but  it  is  not  necessary  to  address  them
    individually. In essence, Mr Akinbade could not demonstrate one  single
    factual error in the statements of the judge in the decision made,  but
    rather pointed to other evidence, which was taken into account  by  the
    judge in reaching the findings made and conclusions drawn, but which Mr
    Akinbade suggested should be accepted in its entirety, to the exclusion
    of other evidence to the contrary. Differences in a  witness  statement
    or explanations for conduct do not render the judge's  findings  errors
    of fact. Mr Akinbade appeared to be  unable  to  understand  that  such
    matters are not factual errors but disagreements with the findings  and
    conclusions of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

 9. In reality, there  was  no  partner  relationship  in  this  case.  The
    appellant and his girlfriend are in no more than a boyfriend/girlfriend
    relationship. They do not live together. They may correspond frequently
    by telephone, but the fact remains that they barely saw each  other  in
    the whole of 2014. He had never visited her at  university.  The  judge
    noted at �38 that the girlfriend did not even attend the appeal hearing
    to give evidence of the so-called relationship and all  the  judge  had
    was an unsigned statement purported to have been drafted  by  her,  but
    with no supporting evidence that  it  was  indeed  her  statement.  The
    explanation for her absence, which was entirely unsatisfactory and  not
    credible, is that her mother was in town and she decided to spend  time
    with her mother. As the judge stated at �41, if there is a relationship
    is it not a strong one, given the lack of contact  between  the  couple
    and her absence from the appeal hearing. Such relationship as there may
    be does not amount to a family life with a partner  in  a  relationship
    akin to marriage. The appellant does not meet any single aspect of  the
    requirements of Appendix FM for leave to remain on  grounds  of  family
    life. Not in any way is this girlfriend  the  appellant's  partner.  At
    Q181 of the interview the appellant was challenged on the fact that  in
    the statement of additional grounds submitted by  his  representatives,
    raising article 8, they completely failed to  mention  the  appellant's
    girlfriend. The only evidence  he  could  produce  at  the  time  of  a
    relationship with her was her contact number in his phone and some text
    messages about football. The judge, correctly  in  my  view,  concluded
    that article 8 is not engaged on these facts. At �41 the judge went  on
    to consider that even if there is a  relationship  such  as  to  engage
    article 8, there was nothing to suggest that she could  not  return  to
    Zimbabwe with him.

10. I find no error of law in the judge's assessment of article 8  and  the
    conclusion that article 8 was not engaged, in that there was no  family
    life within the meaning of the protection afforded by  article  8,  and
    the decision of the Secretary of State  did  not  occasion  such  grave
    interference with family or private life so as engage  article  8.  His
    relationship with his girlfriend might well be part of the private life
    developed in the UK. However, as the judge stated at �41, that  private
    life was developed at a time when his  immigration  statue  "was  of  a
    temporary nature, uncertain and precarious. I give  limited  weight  to
    that private life." Clearly the judge was alluding to section  117B  of
    the 2002 Act, in respect of which the recent  decision  of  AM  (s117B)
    Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC) held that a person's  immigration  status
    is precarious if their continued presence in the UK will  be  dependent
    upon their obtaining a further grant of leave. In fact, he had no legal
    basis to remain in the UK and thus little weight should be accorded  to
    such private life as he may have developed. An application for leave to
    remain submitted in January 2013 was refused but he was encountered  in
    July 2013 and found to be an overstayer. He  subsequently  applied  for
    leave to remain, but  this  application  was  also  rejected.  He  then
    applied for asylum on 5.2.14, which has been  refused  and  his  appeal
    dismissed. It is evident that the appellant is intent on  remaining  in
    the UK and the claimed relationship is such a weak claim to  remain  on
    grounds of family or  private  life  outside  the  Rules  that  it  was
    inevitable that it would fail.

11. In the circumstances, there is no material error of law in the decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal. The dismissal of the appeal under article 8
    ECHR was inevitable on the facts of this case and for which  the  judge
    has in any event provided cogent  reasons,  which  were  open  on  that
    evidence. The decision is neither irrational nor perverse.  It  follows
    that there was no basis  for  Judge  Denson  to  describe  the  judge's
    treatment of article 8 as "totally and utterly inadequate."

Conclusions:

12. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.
