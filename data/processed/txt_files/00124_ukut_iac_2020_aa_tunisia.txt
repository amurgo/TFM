   i. Under the 2000 and  2006  EEA  Regulations  there  was  provision  for
      appeals brought under section 82(1) of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
      and Asylum Act 2002 to be treated as abandoned where an appellant  was
      issued with documentation confirming a right to reside in  the  United
      Kingdom under EU law. Following the changes to the  2002  Act  brought
      about by the Immigration  Act  2014  that  abandonment  provision  was
      revoked and never replaced.



  ii. There has never been provision under any of the EEA Regulations for an
      appeal against an EEA decision brought under those Regulations  to  be
      treated as abandoned following a grant  of  leave  to  remain  or  the
      issuance of specified documentation confirming a right  to  reside  in
      the United Kingdom under EU law.


 iii. It follows that a grant of leave to remain  following  an  application
      under the EU Settlement Scheme does not result in an appeal against an
      EEA decision brought under the 2016 EEA Regulations being  treated  as
      abandoned.

                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction

 1. Must an appeal brought under the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2016 (SI 2016/1052 - "the 2016 Regulations") against an EEA
    decision be treated as abandoned following a grant of leave  to  remain
    to the appellant?

 2. The position originally adopted by the Respondent  in  answer  to  this
    question was "yes". However, she now concedes that this is not the case
    and that there has never been a legislative  mechanism  for  an  appeal
    brought under the 2016 Regulations or their predecessors to be  treated
    as abandoned following a grant of leave to remain or  the  issuance  of
    documentation confirming a right to reside under EU law.

 3. In addition, the Respondent accepts that the First-tier Tribunal  erred
    in law when dismissing the Appellant's appeal, and  that  the  decision
    should be remade and the appeal allowed. Consequently, the substance of
    this appeal can be dealt with  in  fairly  short  order.  However,  the
    jurisdictional  question  of  abandonment  requires   a   little   more
    exploration  to  determine  whether  the  Respondent's  concession   is
    correct.

 4. In undertaking this exercise, we shall refer to the  2016  Regulations,
    the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1003
    - "the 2006 Regulations"), and the Immigration (European Economic Area)
    Regulations 2000 (SI 2000/2326 - "the 2000 Regulations). The three sets
    of  Regulations  shall  be  referred  to  collectively  as   "the   EEA
    Regulations".

Relevant background

 5. The Appellant, a Tunisian national, appeals  against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Cassel ("the judge"), promulgated on 15  July
    2019,  by  which  he  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the
    Respondent's refusal to issue him with a permanent residence card under
    the 2016 Regulations.

 6. In 2013 the Appellant married a Spanish national and was issued with  a
    residence  card  under   the   2006   Regulations.   The   relationship
    subsequently broke down,  divorce  proceedings  were  initiated  on  an
    unknown date in November 2016, and a  decree  absolute  was  issued  in
    April 2017. A further residence card was issued to the Appellant,  this
    time based upon his retained right of residence. The application for  a
    permanent residence card was made in October 2018 and  refused  by  the
    Respondent  on  12  December  2018  on  the  ground  that   there   was
    insufficient evidence of the ex-spouse's employment during  the  period
    relied on by the Appellant. The Appellant appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 7. The Appellant then applied for settled status under the  EU  Settlement
    Scheme (as provided for by Appendix EU to the Immigration Rules). On 22
    May 2019 he was granted Indefinite Leave to Remain ("ILR").

 8. Apparently unaware of the grant of  ILR  and  no  jurisdictional  issue
    having been raised by either party, the judge proceeded to dismiss  the
    appeal on the basis that the Appellant had failed to  demonstrate  that
    he had been "exercising Treaty rights" as  a  "qualified  person",  and
    that there was insufficient evidence of the ex-spouse having worked for
    five years prior to the divorce.

 9. Following the grant of permission, the Respondent provided  a  rule  24
    response, in which it was asserted, for the first time, that the  grant
    of  ILR  meant  that  the  Appellant's  appeal  should  be  treated  as
    abandoned. The Appellant refuted this, but  in  further  correspondence
    the Respondent maintained her original position.

10. At the hearing on 13 January 2020, Mr Avery accepted that the judge had
    erred in law and that the decision should  be  remade  and  the  appeal
    allowed. However, these concessions would be immaterial if the grant of
    ILR to the Appellant resulted in his appeal being treated as  abandoned
    prior to the  hearing  before  the  judge.  On  this  issue,  Mr  Avery
    requested additional time in which to provide a considered response  on
    behalf of the Respondent. In all the circumstances, we acceded to this.

11. Mr Deller subsequently filed and served  concise  written  submissions,
    for which we are grateful. These set out the concession  summarised  in
    paragraph 2, above.

Abandonment: two key matters

12. In determining whether an appeal is to be treated as abandoned,  it  is
    first important to identify the legal basis upon  which  the  appellant
    brought that appeal in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  If  the  appeal  is
    against a decision listed  under  section  82(1)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("NIAA 2002" - whether in  its  current
    iteration or prior to the amendments made by the Immigration Act 2014),
    that appeal is brought "under section 82(1)" and  is  governed  by  the
    regime established by NIAA 2002.

13. However, if the appeal is against an  "EEA  decision",  as  defined  by
    Regulation 2(1) of the 2016 Regulations (or its predecessors under  the
    2006  and  2000  Regulations),  that  appeal  is  brought  under  those
    Regulations by virtue of Regulation 36(1), which provides:

            "36.- Appeal rights

           (1) The subject of an  EEA  decision  may  appeal  against  that
           decision under these Regulations.

    The same right of appeal was previously afforded under Regulation 26 of
    the 2006 Regulations and Regulation 29 of the 2000 Regulations.

14. An appeal brought under the  EEA  Regulations  is/was  subject  to  the
    regime established by the applicable Regulations.

15. The significance  of  the  distinction  between  the  regimes  for  the
    purposes of abandonment  becomes  apparent  when  we  examine  the  EEA
    Regulations in a little more detail, below.

16. The second matter of importance relates to the changes to the appellate
    regime in Part 5 of NIAA 2002 over the course of  time.  Prior  to  the
    significant amendments  brought  about  by  the  Immigration  Act  2014
    appellants were able to appeal under section 82(1) against an extensive
    range of immigration decisions on a wide variety  of  grounds.  Amongst
    those was the assertion that the  decision  in  question  breached  the
    appellant's rights under the EU Treaties (contained in what was section
    84(1)(d)). Thus, an appellant was able to rely  on  claimed  rights  of
    residence under EU law in an appeal brought "under section 82(1)"  NIAA
    2002.

17. Upon the coming into force of section 15 of the Immigration Act 2014 on
    20  October  2014  (subject  to  certain   savings   and   transitional
    provisions) the range of appealable decisions was dramatically  reduced
    and  the  corresponding  grounds  of  appeal   similarly   constrained.
    Appellants could no longer rely on EU law rights  as  a  ground  in  an
    appeal brought "under section 82(1)" NIAA 2002.

18. With these two points in mind, we turn to examine the circumstances  in
    which an appeal concerning the assertion of rights under EU law was  or
    is to be treated as abandoned.

Abandonment of appeals brought under section 82(1) NIAA 2002

19. In its original form, section 104(4) NIAA 2002 provided that:

           "104 Pending appeal

           ...

           (4) An appeal under section 82(1) shall be treated as  abandoned
           if the appellant-

           (a)  is  granted  leave  to  enter  or  remain  in  the   United
           Kingdom..." (Emphasis added)

20. Following changes brought about on 13 November 2006 by the Immigration,
    Asylum  and  Nationality  Act  2006,  section  104(4A)  NIAA  2002  has
    provided, in so far as is relevant for the purposes of this appeal,  as
    follows:

           "104 Pending appeal

           ...

           (4A) An appeal under section 82(1) brought by a person while  he
           is in the United Kingdom shall be treated as  abandoned  if  the
           appellant is granted leave to enter  or  remain  in  the  United
           Kingdom..." (Emphasis added)

21. As we have seen, prior to the amendments  to  NIAA  2002  made  by  the
    Immigration Act 2014, appellants were able to rely on an EU law  ground
    of appeal in an appeal brought "under section 82(1)" NIAA 2002  against
    "an immigration decision". It followed that such an appeal in which  EU
    law rights were relied on was to be treated as abandoned  if  leave  to
    remain was granted.

22. There was a second legislative  mechanism  by  which  an  appeal  under
    section 82(1) NIAA 2002 concerning the assertion of EU law  rights  was
    to be treated as abandoned.

23. Between 1 January 2004 and its revocation on 30 April 2006,  Regulation
    33(1A) of the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2000
    provided:

           "33.- Appeals under the 2002 Act

           ...

           (1A)  A person who has been issued with a  residence  permit,  a
           residence  document  or  a  registration  certificate  or  whose
           passport has been stamped with a family member  residence  stamp
           shall have no right of appeal under section 82(1)  of  the  2002
           Act.  Any  existing  appeal  shall  be  treated  as  abandoned."
           (Emphasis added)

24. From its commencement on 30 April 2006 until its revocation on 6  April
    2015, para 4(2) of Schedule 2 to the 2006 Regulations read as follows:

           "4.-Appeals under the 2002 Act and previous Immigration Acts

           ...

           (2)  A  person  who  has  been  issued   with   a   registration
           certificate,  residence  card,  derivative  residence  card,   a
           document certifying permanent residence or a permanent residence
           card  under  these   Regulations   (including   a   registration
           certificate under these Regulations as applied by  regulation  7
           of  the   Accession   of   Croatia   (Immigration   and   Worker
           Authorisation) Regulations 2013) or a  registration  certificate
           under  the  Accession  (Immigration  and  Worker   Registration)
           Regulations  2004,  or  an  accession  worker  card  under   the
           Accession (Immigration  and  Worker  Authorisation)  Regulations
           2006, or a worker authorisation registration  certificate  under
           the Accession of Croatia (Immigration and Worker  Authorisation)
           Regulations 2013, or a person whose passport  has  been  stamped
           with a family member residence stamp, shall  have  no  right  of
           appeal under  section  2  of  the  Special  Immigration  Appeals
           Commission Act 1997 or  section  82(1)  of  the  2002  Act.  Any
           existing appeal under those sections of those Acts or under  the
           Asylum  and  Immigration  Appeals  Act  1993,  the  Asylum   and
           Immigration Act 1996  or  the  1999  Act  shall  be  treated  as
           abandoned."      (Emphasis added)

25. The issuance of specified documentation therefore resulted in statutory
    abandonment, but only where the appeal had been brought "under  section
    82(1)" NIAA 2002. The rationale behind this  provision  was  presumably
    that the individual concerned would have been given all that he/she had
    sought in the appeal, namely a document confirming his/her right  under
    EU law to reside in the United Kingdom.

26. Once the ability of an appellant to rely on EU law rights in an  appeal
    brought under section 82(1) NIAA 2002 was removed  by  the  Immigration
    Act 2014, the only means by which such rights could be asserted  in  an
    appellate process was under the 2006 Regulations and,  in  due  course,
    the 2016 Regulations.



Appeals brought under the 2000 Regulations

27. Although of historical interest only, we should  briefly  describe  the
    position relating to appeals brought under the 2000 Regulations.

28. Those Regulations did not provide for statutory  abandonment  following
    either a grant  of  leave  to  remain  or  the  issuance  of  specified
    documentation. Further, as  an  appeal  against  an  EEA  decision  was
    brought under the 2000 Regulations and not  under  section  82(1)  NIAA
    2002, the abandonment mechanism  provided  by  what  was  then  section
    104(4) did not apply unless it was listed under para 1 of Schedule 2 to
    the 2000 Regulations as one of the "following provisions  of,  or  made
    under" the NIAA 2002 which applied to an  appeal  brought  under  those
    Regulations "as if it were"  an  appeal  "under  section  82(1)"  (this
    "reading  across"  legislative  device  is  discussed  in  Munday  (EEA
    decision: grounds of  appeal)  [2019]  UKUT  00091(IAC)  in  a  context
    different from that with which we are presently concerned). Section 104
    of the NIAA 2002 was not one of those provisions contained in para 1 of
    Schedule 2. Therefore, an appeal brought  under  the  2000  Regulations
    could not have been treated as abandoned  by  virtue  of  an  appellant
    being granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

Appeals brought under the 2006 Regulations

29. As with the 2000 Regulations, the 2006 Regulations did not provide  for
    statutory abandonment where an appellant  had  been  granted  leave  to
    remain or issued with specified documentation. Again,  the  abandonment
    mechanism contained in what had become section 104(4A)  NIAA  2002  did
    not apply unless it was listed under para 1 of Schedule 1 to  the  2006
    Regulations as one of the provisions  of  the  2002  Act  to  be  "read
    across" to an appeal brought under the 2006  Regulations.  Section  104
    was not so listed. As was the  position  under  their  predecessor,  an
    appeal brought under the 2006 Regulations could not have  been  treated
    as abandoned by virtue of an appellant being granted leave to remain in
    the United Kingdom.

30. Alternatively, would the issuance of specified documentation confirming
    a right to reside in the United Kingdom under EU law have  resulted  in
    the  statutory  abandonment  of  an  appeal  brought  under  the   2006
    Regulations, with reference to paragraph 4(2) of Schedule  2  to  those
    Regulations prior to its revocation? The  answer  to  this  is  clearly
    "no". As we have seen, this provision related only to  appeals  brought
    "under section 82(1)" NIAA 2002.

31. Following its revocation, paragraph 4(2) of  Schedule  2  to  the  2006
    Regulations was not replaced with an equivalent provision prior to  the
    revocation of those Regulations in their entirety on 1  February  2017.
    Presumably, the reason for this is that its utility had ceased once the
    amended NIAA 2002 precluded appellants from relying on rights under  EU
    law in appeals brought under section 82(1).

32. Para 4(2) of Schedule  2  to  the  2006  Regulations  continues  to  be
    mentioned in legislation, notwithstanding its revocation. The  relevant
    requirements of Rule 16 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal)
    Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014 (SI 2014/2604) state:

           "16.- Appeal treated as abandoned or finally determined

           (1) A party must notify the Tribunal if they are aware that-

           ...

           (d) a document listed in paragraph 4(2) of  Schedule  2  to  the
           2006 Regulations has been issued to the appellant.

           (2) Where an appeal is treated as abandoned pursuant to  section
           104(4A) of the 2002 Act or paragraph 4(2)of Schedule 2  to  2006
           Regulations,  the  Tribunal  must  send  the  parties  a  notice
           informing them that the appeal is being treated as abandoned  or
           finally determined, as the case may be."

33. As with the First-tier Tribunal's Procedure Rules, we find a  reference
    to para 4(2) of Schedule 2 in Rule 17A(1)(d) and (2)  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698):

           "17A.-(1) A party to an  asylum  case  or  an  immigration  case
           before the Upper Tribunal must notify the  [Upper]  Tribunal  if
           they are aware that-

           ...

           (d) a document listed in paragraph 4(2) of  Schedule  2  to  the
           Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006(c)  has
           been issued to the appellant.

           (2) Where an appeal is treated as abandoned pursuant to  section
           104(4) or (4A) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
           2002(d) or paragraph 4(2)  of  Schedule  2  to  the  Immigration
           (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006,  or  as   finally
           determined  pursuant  to  section  104(5)  of  the  Nationality,
           Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the Upper  Tribunal  must  send
           the parties a notice informing them that  the  appeal  is  being
           treated as abandoned or finally determined."

34. On our analysis, these provisions of the Procedure Rules can only  have
    application to appeals brought "under section 82(1)"  NIAA  2002  which
    were pending when  the  appellant  had  been  issued  with  a  document
    confirming a right of residence under EU law prior to the revocation of
    paragraph 4(2) of Schedule 2 to the 2006 Regulations on 16 April  2015.
    It must be the case that appeals have  in  the  past  been  treated  as
    abandoned in accordance with this provision and  the  Procedure  Rules.
    Whilst the possibility of  such  cases  existing  even  now  cannot  be
    excluded, they would form a very small and ever-diminishing cohort.

Appeals brought under the 2016 Regulations

35. Following on from its predecessors, the 2016 Regulations do not contain
    any provision which directly provides for statutory abandonment  of  an
    appeal where an appellant has been granted leave  to  remain.  As  with
    appeals under the 2006 Regulations, the statutory abandonment mechanism
    contained in section 104(4A)  NIAA  2002  can  only  apply  to  appeals
    brought under the 2016 Regulations if it is to be "read across" to such
    appeals. It is apparent that section 104 NIAA 2002 is not amongst those
    provisions listed in  para  1  of  Schedule  2  to  those  Regulations.
    Therefore, as was the position under both the 2000 Regulations and 2006
    Regulations, an appeal brought under the  2016  Regulations  cannot  be
    treated as abandoned by virtue of an appellant being granted  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom.

36. For reasons set out  previously,  it  is  unsurprising  that  the  2016
    Regulations have never contained an equivalent provision  to  paragraph
    4(2) of Schedule 2 to the 2006 Regulations: appellants who have brought
    appeals under section 82(1) NIAA 2002 cannot rely on a ground of appeal
    asserting a breach of rights under EU law and therefore the issuance of
    specified documentation would be immaterial to such appeals.

37. Regulation 35 (the successor to Regulation 25 of the 2006  Regulations)
    confirms that an appeal under the 2016 Regulations is to be treated  as
    pending until the appeal (or a further appeal) is  finally  determined,
    withdrawn  or  abandoned.  The  Regulation  makes  no   provision   for
    abandonment following a grant of leave to remain.

38. We have had regard to the Practice Directions of  the  Immigration  and
    Asylum Chambers of the First-tier  Tribunal  and  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    Whilst Direction 5 refers to pending appeals and abandonment,  it  adds
    nothing to our analysis.

Conclusions on the abandonment issue

39. Our conclusions on the abandonment issue are as follows:

         i. Under the 2000 Regulations and the 2006 Regulations  there  was
            provision for appeals brought under section 82(1) NIAA 2002  to
            be treated as abandoned where  an  appellant  was  issued  with
            documentation confirming  a  right  to  reside  in  the  United
            Kingdom under EU  law.  Following  the  changes  to  NIAA  2002
            brought about by the Immigration Act 2014, as of 6 April  2015,
            that abandonment provision was revoked and never replaced;




        ii. There has never been provision under any of the EEA Regulations
            for an appeal against  an  EEA  decision  brought  under  those
            Regulations to be treated as abandoned  following  a  grant  of
            leave to remain or  the  issuance  of  specified  documentation
            confirming a right to reside in the  United  Kingdom  under  EU
            law;




       iii. It follows that  a  grant  of  leave  to  remain  following  an
            application under the EU Settlement Scheme does not  result  in
            an appeal against  an  EEA  decision  brought  under  the  2016
            Regulations being treated as abandoned.

40. As a consequence of these conclusions, the Respondent's  concession  on
    the abandonment issue is correct.

41. At first blush, it might be thought that a grant of ILR to an appellant
    seeking to rely on rights under EU law would result in  them  achieving
    all that they could hope for, namely settled status in United  Kingdom.
    It should be appreciated, however, that ILR involves a grant  of  leave
    under domestic law, whereas an individual may well wish to assert,  and
    have confirmed, rights under  EU  law;  rights  which  may  in  certain
    respects offer additional protective features. In  respect  of  appeals
    against EEA decisions brought under the 2016 Regulations, an individual
    is entitled to pursue this course of action.

42. In light of the foregoing,  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the  EEA
    decision, brought under the  2016  Regulations,  did  not  fall  to  be
    treated as abandoned by virtue of the grant of ILR on 22 May  2019.  In
    consequence, the First-tier Tribunal had jurisdiction  to  decide  that
    appeal. The appeal is  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  we  too  have
    jurisdiction to deal with it.

Error of law and remaking the decision

43. As noted earlier in our decision, the Respondent has conceded that  the
    judge erred in law. In our judgment that concession was correctly made.
    The  judge  wrongly  sought  proof  from  the  Appellant  that  he  was
    "exercising Treaty rights" and that he was a  "qualified  person",  and
    failed to appreciate  that  time  accrued  with  a  retained  right  of
    residence counted towards the five years necessary for the  acquisition
    of a permanent right of residence.

44. We therefore set the judge's decision aside.

45. Based on the evidence  adduced  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the
    Respondent  has  also  conceded  that  the  Appellant  has  acquired  a
    permanent right of residence in this country. Again, we agree with this
    concession.

46. Accordingly, we go on to remake the  decision  and  conclude  that  the
    Respondent's decision of 12  December  2018  breaches  the  Appellant's
    rights under EU law.

Anonymity
47. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction and, in all
    the circumstances, nor do we.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

We set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

We remake the decision by allowing the appeal.
