For the appellant:     Ms C Record
For the respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Francis Attah, date of birth 19.1.77, is  a  citizen  of
    Ghana.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Bart-Stewart promulgated 26.10.15, dismissing his  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary  of  State,  dated  12.6.14,  to  refuse  his
    application made on  12.5.14  for  an  EEA  Permanent  Residence  Card,
    pursuant to the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.   The  Judge  heard
    the appeal on 4.9.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Shimmin  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    20.6.16.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 25.8.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons summarised below, I found no error of law in the making
    of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such as to the  decision  of
    Judge Bart-Stewart to be set aside.

 6. Following an application made  in  2008,  in  2010  the  appellant  was
    granted an EEA residence card, valid until 22.4.15, as confirmation  of
    a right to reside in the UK on the basis of his  relationship  with  an
    unmarried EEA national partner. In May 2014 he applied for a  permanent
    residence. His application was  refused  and  his  residence  card  was
    revoked. It transpires that he was no longer in the  relationship  with
    his unmarried partner, disentitling  him  to  the  EEA  residence  card
    previously issued, pursuant to regulation 20(2).

 7. The application for a permanent residence card was made on the basis of
    his residence in the UK  in  accordance  with  the  regulations  for  a
    continuous period of 5 years and had retained rights of residence under
    regulation 10. The  Secretary  of  State  concluded  that  he  had  not
    completed 5 years' residence in accordance with the regulations.

 8. The appellant contended that his relationship was not as  an  unmarried
    partner, but a customary marriage i.e.  by  proxy  with  neither  party
    present, entered into on his behalf in Ghana on 19.4.10. That  marriage
    was not registered.  He  claims  that  he  was  divorced  on  17.10.13,
    dissolved  by  custom,  and  that  the  dissolution  of  marriage   was
    registered on 17.4.14. The following  month,  the  appellant  made  his
    permanent residence application, which was refused by the Secretary  of
    State.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Shimmin on the basis that  it
    is arguable that the First-tier Tribunal did not properly consider  the
    case law relevant to the issues and apply that law correctly,  and  did
    not correctly apply the  facts  to  the  issue  of  retained  right  of
    residence. As Judge Bart-Stewart noted at  �14  of  the  decision,  the
    appellant failed to provide any evidence that  his  customary  marriage
    was recognised as valid by the EU Member State of his  former  partner.
    This was obviously a reference to Kareem (Proxy  marriages  -  EU  law)
    [2014]  UKUT  00024  (IAC).  According  to  Kareem,  there  has  to  be
    independent and reliable evidence about the recognition of the marriage
    under the law of the EEA national's country  of  citizenship,  and  the
    country where the marriage took place. Applied to the present  case  it
    has to be demonstrated that the proxy marriage  was  not  only  validly
    executed in Ghana, but that such a marriage is  legally  recognised  in
    the EU Member State of the customary spouse, the Netherlands.

10. Ms Record relied on documents that were placed  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, with translation. I note from �6 of the decision that at  the
    First-tier Tribunal the appellant also submitted a copy of the original
    marriage certificate and a receipt from the Netherlands Consulate of an
    application  for  legalisation  of  marriage,  together  with  original
    declarations in support of marriage.

11. I have carefully considered the documents put before me by  Ms  Record,
    which appear to  be  the  same  as  those  put  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. The first document which is purported to have been issued  by
    the Republic of Ghana Judicial Service on  5.3.15,  confirms  that  the
    person sealing the marriage certificate, one George B Kom, is a  notary
    public of Ghana. As the document makes clear, the attestation is as  to
    the stamp, signature and seal  of  the  notary  public,  "and  not  the
    contents of the attached document." This takes the appellant's case  no
    further.

12.  The  second  document,  purportedly  issued  by  Hilda  Hinidza-Elluh,
    Assistant Director, Legal and  Consular  Bureau,  Ministry  of  Foreign
    Affairs and Regional Integration, dated 6.5.15, certifies the signature
    of the person making the attestation  in  the  first  document,  Samuel
    Boakye-Yiadom, is the true signature of  that  person,  who  is  Second
    Deputy Judicial Secretary of the Judicial Service of Ghana.

13. To the left-hand corner of this second document is a  paper  attachment
    (I confirmed this with the original shown to me at  court),  apparently
    written in Dutch, and stamped with a rubber stamp  mark  covering  both
    the original document and the attachment. It is this  attachment  which
    has been translated  by  Absolute  Translations.  It's  purpose  is  to
    authenticate the signature of Ms Hinidza-Elluh. The  authentication  is
    made by KW Schemkes and took place in Accra, Ghana, but is  not  dated.
    The attachment adds, "This authentication relates only to the signature
    and does not confirm the accuracy of the contents of the document."

14. Judge Bart-Stewart also had a document  which  was  a  receipt  for  an
    application for legalisation of marriage/divorce certificate, submitted
    to the Netherlands Embassy in Ghana. There  is  no  evidence  that  the
    application  was  granted  or  that  either  marriage  or  divorce  was
    recognised as valid in the Netherlands. The documents certainly do  not
    provide independent and reliable evidence that the  customary  marriage
    entered into in Ghana  is  recognised  as  valid  by  the  law  of  the
    Netherlands.  All  these  documents  appear  to  do  is   confirm   the
    authenticity of the signatures of the marriage, and in turn  confirming
    the  authenticity  of  the   signature   of   the   person   confirming
    authenticity.

15. None of these documents resolve the issue in the appeal or provide  any
    material assistance to the appellant. It  remains  the  case  that  the
    appellant has failed to demonstrate that his customary marriage entered
    into by proxy in Ghana was recognised as valid by the EU  Member  State
    of his former spouse, i.e. the Netherlands. There  was  nothing  before
    the First-tier Tribunal or placed before me  to  demonstrate  that  the
    judge's conclusion that the Secretary of State was correct to  continue
    to consider his former relationship as that of  an  unmarried  partner,
    and thus not a person entitled to permanent residence under  regulation
    10.





Conclusions:

16. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.



Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.
