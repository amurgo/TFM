Representation:

For the Claimant: Mr Hussain, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent appeals with permission  against  the  determination  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge De Haney promulgated  on  20  February  2014,
    allowing the appeal  of  Irfan  Yousif  ("the  claimant")  against  the
    decision made on 17 April 2013 to refuse him  entry  clearance  to  the
    United Kingdom as the spouse of Tahrah Yasmin Ali.

 2. The claimant's case is that he was entitled to entry clearance  to  the
    United Kingdom as the spouse of Ms Tahrah Yasmin Ali ("the sponsor") on
    the basis that the requirements of the Immigration Rules are met and/or
    in the alternative that refusal to grant him entry clearance  would  be
    disproportionate and thus contrary to the United Kingdom's  obligations
    pursuant to Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention.

 3. The sponsor has two jobs, working for Tesco and  at  Watan  Superstore.
    The couple have a daughter born in the United  Kingdom  on  5  February
    2013 who is a British citizen.  The sponsor lives with  her  stepmother
    and brother.  The stepmother undergoes dialysis three times a week  and
    requires a considerable degree of care as a result; her father lives in
    the house next door which also belongs to him.   The  sponsor's  mother
    lives some distance away but  travels  to  Oldham  to  look  after  the
    daughter to allow the sponsor to work seven days a week.

 4. The application was refused on the basis  that  the  claimant  had  not
    provided the specified evidence to show  that  the  sponsor  earns  the
    income claimed from her  employment by Watan Superstore  and  thus  did
    not fulfil the requirements of Appendix FM-SE.

 5. The appeal came before Judge De Haney at Manchester on 7 February 2014.
     He heard evidence from the sponsor and found that:-

      a) there was no doubt that the sponsor was in genuine  employment  and
         that her combined salaries were in excess of ï¿½18,600 [16],  it  had
         not been challenged by the respondent [17];

      b) the gross annual salary  paid  by  Watan  could  be  calculated  by
         reference to the letter provided but did not meet  the  requirement
         of Appendix FM-SE as it did  not  give  the  date  upon  which  she
         started work [17];

      c) the sponsor's bank statements did not show wages being paid in from
         Watan because, as she worked seven days a week, she was  unable  to
         pay money into the bank in working hours [18];

      d) "in all the particular circumstances of this appeal it is such that
         it is a disproportionate interference with the right to family life
         of the appellant, his British  citizen  child  and  wife"  and  the
         interference by refusal of entry clearance was not proportionate.

 6. The respondent sought permission to appeal on the grounds that:-

      a) that the judge had erred in going on to consider Article 8  without
         first considering, as he  was  bound  to  do,  whether  there  were
         arguably good grounds for doing so as per Gulshan (Article 8 -  new
         Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640;

      b) that the findings do not amount to a compelling basis on  which  to
         allow the appeal as the judge did not provide adequate  reasons  as
         to why there were compelling  circumstances  or  why  it  would  be
         disproportionate  to  require  the  claimant  to   make   a   fresh
         application and maintain the status quo.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Saffer on
    13 May 2014.

    The Hearing

 8. Mr Harrison submitted that Judge De Haney had  failed  to  provide  any
    proper basis for allowing the appeal and did not appear to  have  taken
    into account the fact that the claimant had not met the requirements of
    the Rules.

 9. Mr Hussain submitted that the conclusion had been one open to the judge
    and that this was not a "near miss" argument.  He submitted that, given
    that Article 8 was not provided for in the Rules insofar as it  relates
    to entry clearance, as opposed to leave to remain, it  was  a  relevant
    factor to take into account and  that  the  judge  did  not  take  into
    account matters which were not open to him following Patel and others v
    SSHD [2013] UKSC 72.

10. It is not arguable that Judge De Haney erred in proceeding directly  to
    consider Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.  Whilst the  decision
    in Gulshan  may  indicate  those  circumstances  in  which  it  is  not
    necessary for a judge to consider Article 8 outside the Rules  it  must
    be borne in mind that, unlike cases  regarding  leave  to  remain,  the
    issue of Article 8 with respect to entry clearance is not provided  for
    in a similar way.  Further, the proposition that a judge need not go on
    to consider Article 8 unless there are compelling circumstances is  not
    authority for the proposition that he should not do so and  that  doing
    so is an error of law in itself.

11. That said, the decision with regards to Article  8  and  in  particular
    proportionality fails to set out in any adequate way the factors  which
    Judge De Haney took into account both in favour of the claimant and  in
    favour of the respondent bearing in mind the  public  interest  in  the
    maintenance of a system of immigration control which is  certain,  even
    if complex, and containing Rules which are applicable to all.

12. On that basis I was satisfied the determination of Judge De  Haney  did
    involve the making of an error of law with respect  to  Article  8  and
    that that part of the determination would need to be set aside.   There
    is no reason on which his findings of fact should be set aside.

13. Both representatives agreed that it would  be  sensible  to  hear  some
    additional brief evidence from the sponsor and her mother.

14. The sponsor explained that she has worked continuously,  seven  days  a
    week, in two jobs full-time in  order  to  make  it  possible  for  her
    husband to join her.  She said that she found it very draining  looking
    after a small child as well even with the support  of  her  mother  and
    that this has had the result of her being diagnosed with depression and
    prescribed antidepressants.  She said that she does not  wish  to  take
    these given that this makes it difficult for  her  to  look  after  her
    child properly and to work.  She said that she is partly reliant on her
    mother to help.

15. The sponsor's mother gave evidence explaining that in  order  to  allow
    the sponsor to do early shifts she gets a bus at 5.10am from Manchester
    to travel to Oldham, sometimes having  to  take  a  taxi  to  get  into
    Manchester first, and stays looking after the child.  This is not  that
    easy given that her former husband's new wife lives in the  house  (the
    sponsor's stepmother).  She  described  the  sponsor  as  an  excellent
    mother who is  doing  her  best  to  bring  up  a  child  in  difficult
    circumstances and that there are significant difficulties caused to the
    whole extended family by the refusal of entry clearance.

16. In closing submissions Mr Harrison said that he had nothing  materially
    to add to what was set out in the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  refusal
    other than to say that it was open for a fresh application to be made.

17. Mr Hussain submitted  that  there  were  on  the  facts  of  this  case
    compelling reasons given the impact on the extended  family;  the  fact
    that  the  sponsor  is  unwell  and  suffering  from  depression;   the
    difficulty arising from the stepmother's dialysis three days a week and
    that  when  taking  this  as  a   whole,   there   were   compassionate
    circumstances.

18. Both the sponsor and her mother  gave  evidence  in  clear,  forthright
    terms and  with  considerable  articulacy.  Both  were  impressive  and
    compelling witnesses.  Their  evidence  was  sincere,  and  given  with
    considerable candour.

19. I am satisfied from the evidence before me that the sponsor  is  deeply
    committed to her relationship to the claimant.  I am satisfied that she
    has suffered from depression as a result of  the  separation  from  her
    husband as confirmed in the  letters  from  the  doctor  and  also  the
    evidence from her mother.  None of this  has  been  challenged  by  the
    respondent.

20. I am satisfied also by the sponsor's mother that she  is  committed  to
    ensuring a good family life for her daughter and grandchild;  I  accept
    that she goes to considerable lengths to look after the child  so  that
    the sponsor can continue to work, as she said.

21. The sponsor's problems are compounded by the fact that her  stepmother,
    with whom she lives, and who is partially dependent on  her,  undergoes
    dialysis three days a week and that puts a significant  strain  on  the
    family although the sponsor did quite spontaneously say that her sister-
    in-law helps look after the mother and  the  father  lives  next  door.
    Again, that is not challenged.

22. I accept also that the presence of the claimant in the  United  Kingdom
    would make this situation considerably easier.  He  would  be  able  to
    look after the child and to assist round  the  house,  as  the  sponsor
    said.

23. Whilst I accept that the sponsor is providing care for her daughter,  I
    accept also that she is not able to spend much time with her  and  that
    this contributes to her  depression.  None  of  this  is  in  the  best
    interests of the child. This is a case in  which  there  is  clearly  a
    strong family life and where there is no suggestion  of  dishonesty  on
    the part of either the claimant or the sponsor in any way whatsoever.

24. In assessing article 8, I bear in mind  the  decision  of  the  Supreme
    Court in Patel & Ors v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72 per Lord Carnwath


      54. The difference between the two positions may not be  as  stark  as
      the submissions before  us  have  suggested.  The  most  authoritative
      guidance on the correct approach of the tribunal to article 8  remains
      that of Lord Bingham in Huang. In the passage cited by Burnton LJ Lord
      Bingham observed that the rules are designed to identify those to whom
      "on grounds such as kinship and family  relationship  and  dependence"
      leave to  enter  should  be  granted,  and  that  such  rules  "to  be
      administratively workable, require that a line  be  drawn  somewhere".
      But that was no more than the starting point for the consideration  of
      article 8. Thus in Mrs Huang's own case, the most relevant rule  (rule
      317) was not satisfied, since she was not, when the decision was made,
      aged 65 or over and she was not a widow. He commented at para 6:
           "Such a rule, which does not lack a rational basis, is not to be
           stigmatised as arbitrary or objectionable.  But  an  applicant's
           failure to qualify under the rules is for present  purposes  the
           point at which to begin, not end,  consideration  of  the  claim
           under article 8. The terms of the rules  are  relevant  to  that
           consideration, but they are not determinative."


      55. Thus the balance drawn  by  the  rules  may  be  relevant  to  the
      consideration of proportionality.  I  said  much  the  same  in  Rudi.
      Although I rejected the concept of a "near-miss principle", I did  not
      see this as inconsistent with the Collins J's words in Lekstaka:
           "Collins J's statement, on which the court relied [in SB], seems
           unexceptionable. It is saying no more, as I read it,  than  that
           the practical or compassionate considerations which underlie the
           policy are also likely to be relevant to the cases of those  who
           fall just outside it, and to that extent may add weight to their
           argument for exceptional treatment. He is not saying that  there
           arises any presumption or expectation that the  policy  will  be
           extended to embrace them." (para 31(ii))


      (My reference to "exceptional treatment" needs to be read now  in  the
      light of Huang para 20 in which Lord Bingham made clear that, contrary
      to previous Court of Appeal case-law, there was no separate  "test  of
      exceptionality".)


      56. Although  the  context  of  the  rules  may  be  relevant  to  the
      consideration of proportionality, I agree with Burnton  LJ  that  this
      cannot be equated with a formalised  "near-miss"  or  "sliding  scale"
      principle, as argued for by Mr Malik. That approach is unsupported  by
      Strasbourg authority, or by a proper reading of Lord Bingham's  words.
      Mrs Huang's case for favourable treatment outside the  rules  did  not
      turn on how close she had come to compliance with rule 317, but on the
      application of the family values which underlie that rule and  are  at
      the heart also of article 8. Conversely, a near-miss under  the  rules
      cannot provide substance to a human rights  case  which  is  otherwise
      lacking in merit.


      57. It is important to remember  that  article  8  is  not  a  general
      dispensing power. It is to be  distinguished  from  the  Secretary  of
      State's discretion to allow leave to remain outside the  rules,  which
      may be unrelated to  any  protected  human  right.  The  merits  of  a
      decision not to depart from the rules are not  reviewable  on  appeal:
      section 86(6). One may sympathise with Sedley LJ's call in Pankina for
      "common sense" in the application of the rules to graduates who have

25. In principle this is the type of case where  the  rules  allow  for  an
    applicant to enter  the  United  Kingdom;  there  is  no  objection  in
    principle to a spouse entering the United  Kingdom  particularly  where
    there is no doubt that the marriage is subsisting and where he  is  the
    father of a British born child.  That said, it is not in  dispute  that
    the requirements of the Rules have not been met insofar as they  relate
    to documentary evidence.  Even though it is accepted that there will in
    practice be no recourse to public funds, and it is not challenged  that
    the sponsor does in fact earn more than the income  required,  in  this
    case significant weight is to be attached to the fact that there should
    be a system of Rules applicable to all and it is open to the  Secretary
    of State to include within that system detailed requirements as to  the
    documents which must be produced in order to show that the requirements
    of the Rules are met.

26. In this case, however, there are a number  of  factors  which  must  be
    taken into account in the claimant's  favour  including  the  continued
    strain on the sponsor; the effect on other members of the  family;  the
    difficulties that the  sponsor  has  in  either  taking  medication  to
    alleviate her depression in which case she would not properly  be  able
    to work as she could not get up  early  enough  due  to  the  soporific
    effects of the medication and the impact on the extended family whereby
    the status quo can only be maintained by quite extraordinary commitment
    on behalf of the sponsor's mother.  As here, as with the  appellant  in
    Huang to which Lord Carnwath refers, a  case  of  favourable  treatment
    outside the Rules is not sought on the basis of how close the  claimant
    came to compliance but it is submitted that the application  of  family
    values which underlie the Rule and  are  at  the  heart  of  Article  8
    militates in favour of the claimant.  I bear in mind also that it would
    be possible for the claimant to make a fresh application but that would
    not inevitably succeed and may  result  in  significant  other  delays.
    Both the claimant and sponsor are aware  that  in  consequence  if  the
    appeal succeeds, the claimant will need  to  spend  ten  years  in  the
    United Kingdom before being granted settlement.  That is something they
    accept.

27. I am satisfied that although the Immigration Rules have not  been  met,
    it is nonetheless, on the facts of this case, appropriate  to  consider
    whether, nonetheless, it would be in breach  of  Article  8  to  refuse
    entry clearance to the claimant.  I am satisfied  that  a  family  life
    exists between the claimant and his wife and between the claimant,  his
    wife and their child.  The child  is  a  British  citizen  and  has  an
    extended family in the United  Kingdom  as  does  the  sponsor.   I  am
    satisfied therefore that refusal of entry clearance does constitute  an
    interference with the right to respect for family life.

28. Whilst I consider that significant weight is  to  be  attached  to  the
    public interest in the maintenance of immigration control and a system
    of Rules which is applicable to all, I consider that on the  particular
    facts  of  this  case  and  given  the  number  and  variety   of   the
    circumstances set out above that whilst no one of them might amount  to
    compelling circumstances, that viewed together, and weighed against the
    significant weight to be attached to the public interest in maintaining
    immigration control, that in this case it would not be proportionate to
    refuse entry clearance to the claimant, given the compelling nature  of
    the circumstances.

29.  Accordingly,  for  these  reasons,  the  determination  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge De Haney is  set  aside.   I  remake  the  decision  by
    allowing the appeal on article 8 grounds.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

    1. The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge De Haney is set aside.

    2. I remake the decision by allowing the appeal on article 8 grounds.
