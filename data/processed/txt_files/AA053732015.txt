Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr K Behbahani, Solicitor


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent to this appeal is a citizen of Iran.  The  appellant  is
    the Secretary of State for the Home Department, who has  appealed  with
    the permission of the First-tier Tribunal against a decision  of  Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal Graham,  allowing  the  respondent's  appeal
    against a decision of the Secretary of State refusing to vary his leave
    to remain on asylum grounds.

 2. It is more convenient to refer to the parties as they were  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal. I shall therefore refer to TM from now on as  "the
    appellant" and the Secretary of State as "the respondent".

 3. TM's claim was based on his fear of the authorities in the light of his
    political  opinions  and  activities.  The  respondent  rejected  these
    matters and found the appellant not credible. The  appellant  appealed,
    arguing his account was true and the respondent had not  considered  it
    properly. Additionally, the grounds argued  the  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the law because, whilst it stated the  appellant  would
    be removed, it did not state  under  which  power  removal  was  to  be
    effected.

 4. It appears that, on reflection, the  respondent  took  a  similar  view
    because the presenting officer indicated to  the  judge  he  wished  to
    withdraw the decision. The judge applied rule  17(2)  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber), which
    provides that permission should be sought from the Tribunal. The judge,
    noting that the issue had been raised at  an  earlier  case  management
    review hearing but not addressed further by the respondent, refused  to
    accept the withdrawal. In paragraph 17 of her decision  she  found  the
    decision was not  in  accordance  with  the  law  and  the  application
    remained outstanding for a lawful decision to be made. She continued as
    follows:

         "Notice of Decision

         I allow the Appeal on asylum grounds but  the  Appellant  does  not
         qualify for humanitarian protection as he is a refugee.

         I allow the Appeal on human rights grounds."

 5. The judge also made a fee award of the whole fee of ï¿½140.

 6. The respondent applied for permission to  appeal  because,  having  not
    made any findings on the claim, the judge should not have  allowed  the
    appeal on asylum and human rights grounds. Nor should she have  made  a
    fee award. The grounds requested  the  Tribunal  correct  the  decision
    under rule 31 and re-promulgate it.

 7. In granting permission to appeal,  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Parkes considered the errors identified were of too great  a  magnitude
    to be corrected under the "slip rule".

 8. I heard submissions on whether the judge made a material error of  law.
    Both representatives stated the error was material and the decision  of
    Judge Graham should be set aside. They also  agreed  that  the  correct
    course would be to re-make the decision in the terms evidently intended
    by Judge Graham.

Error of law

 9. The decision is plainly mistaken in allowing the appeal on  asylum  and
    human rights grounds given the very  limited  nature  of  the  decision
    intended by the judge. The  judge  made  no  findings  at  all  on  the
    appellant's claim. Whilst this was no doubt an oversight by the  judge,
    permission to appeal having been granted,  the  matter  is  before  the
    Upper Tribunal to decide whether the decision contains a material error
    of law such that it must be set aside. It plainly does and I  therefore
    set aside the decision and re-make  it  by  substituting  the  decision
    which the judge intended to make, that the appeal  is  allowed  to  the
    extent the decision is not in accordance with the law.

10. As for the fee award, this is not an appealable decision.  However,  it
    appears a fee was paid  in  this  case  and  the  judge  was  therefore
    entitled to make a fee award.

NOTICE OF DECISION

The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal made a material error of  law  and  her
decision allowing the  appeal  is  set  aside.  The  following  decision  is
substituted:

The appeal is allowed to the extent the decision is not in  accordance  with
the law.
