                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

1.   This is an appeal brought by the Appellant  against  the  determination
    of the First-tier Tribunal Judge, promulgated on 29 July 2014.  By that
    determination the Judge dismissed the Appellant's  appeal  against  the
    Secretary of State's decision of 3 December 2013 refusing to issue  the
    Appellant with residence documents as the spouse of a qualified person.



Background facts

2.   The background facts can be summarised  shortly  so  far  as  relevant.
    The Appellant is a national of Albania with a date of birth given as  8
    March 1980.  He says that  he  is  lawfully  married  to  a  Lithuanian
    national ("the spouse") having  been  married  on  13  August  2013  as
    evidenced by, amongst other things, a marriage certificate.  It is said
    that they live together in London.

3.   The Appellant has  a  minor  child  (born  in  2011)  from  a  previous
    relationship.  He apparently remains in contact with that child.

4.   The Appellant entered the United Kingdom clandestinely  in  1998.   His
    claim for asylum was refused. On 16 November 2001 he was  convicted  of
    assault occasioning actual bodily harm for which he was sentenced to  a
    community punishment order with  unpaid  work  and  compensation  order
    requirements attached.  The Appellant was then convicted  again,  on  7
    April 2009, for a serious offence  under  Section  18  of  the  Offence
    Against  the  Persons  Act  1861.  The  conviction  was   for   assault
    occasioning grievous bodily harm in relation to an attack committed  in
    2007.  For this he was  sentenced  to  four  years  custody.  This  was
    undoubtedly a serious offence.  It was a cold  and  vicious  attack  on
    someone who was in no position to defend himself at the time.

5.   Thus the Appellant's last offence was committed in  2007.   He  was  on
    bail without incident from 2007 to April  2009.   He  was  released  on
    licence in 2011.  A period of supervision thereafter expired on 8 March
    2013. We are told that he has not offended again since 2007.

6.   On 30 July 2012 the Secretary of State made a deportation  order  which
    came into effect on 21 February 2013 following  the  dismissal  of  the
    Appellant's appeal against that deportation order heard on 20  November
    2012.  Further representations of 11 March  2013  were  treated  as  an
    application to  revoke  the  deportation  order.  The  application  was
    refused and certified.

This application

7.   In 2013 the Appellant also applied for a residence card  on  the  basis
    of his marriage to an EEA national.  On 3 December 2013  the  Secretary
    of State refused that application on  the  grounds  that,  due  to  the
    Appellant's past criminal conduct, his removal would  be  justified  on
    the grounds of public policy or  public  security  in  accordance  with
    Regulations 20(1) and 21 of the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 ("the EEA Regulations").  The Secretary of  State  was
    also not satisfied that the spouse was a  qualified  person,  namely  a
    worker.

8.   We note that the Secretary of State accepted in terms  in  her  reasons
    for refusal  that  the  Appellant  was  married  to  the  spouse.   She
    maintained that acceptance in her  later  letter  of  4  February  2014
    albeit refusing to revoke the deportation order.

The hearing and determination below

9.   On 29 January 2014 the Appellant lodged notice of appeal.

10.  At the hearing below both, the Appellant, the spouse and  her  employer
    gave evidence.  At paragraphs 24 to 26 of the determination the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge said this:

         "24. I remind myself that the onus of proof in this case rests with
             the  Appellant  to  the  civil  standard  of  a   balance   of
             probabilities. It is also necessary to remind myself that  the
             instant appeal  is  not  against  either  the  making  of  the
             deportation order or the refusal to revoke it.  Those  matters
             have been dealt what already and I must regard  the  decisions
             of my colleagues as my starting point.


         25.  Having read the remarks of the learned recorder,  I  can  only
             agree with him that the offence of  which  the  Appellant  was
             convicted was a very serious one. That view has been  endorsed
             by my colleague at Taylor House and by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
             Reeds. On that basis alone,  the  refusal  is  correctly  made
             under Regulation 20(1).  However, in his evidence to  me,  the
             Appellant was noticeably vague about details  of  the  offence
             and sought to minimise what had happened. The letter from  the
             Probation Officer does  not  help  as  it  does  it  does  not
             indicate that she has ever met the Appellant. In my  judgement
             the respondent was correct to refuse the card under Regulation
             20(1).


         26.  The evidence of as  relationship  between  the  Appellant  and
             sponsor was not impressive. The  Appellant  is  married  to  a
             Lithuanian, but had no knowledge of that country. The evidence
             of the sponsor was of lamentable quality.  She  differed  from
             the Appellant as to the dates of their relationship  etc.  Her
             evidence as to her employment was incredible. She told me that
             she did have contracts of employment, but none  were  produced
             and Mr Dirsha told me that he did not bother with such."

11.  The conclusion of the First-tier Tribunal Judge against those  findings
    was that the Appellant had not placed before  him  sufficient  credible
    evidence to show to the standard of proof  required  of  appellants  in
    cases such as these that he was entitled  to  a  residence  card.   The
    appeal was accordingly dismissed.

12.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge went on  to  consider  the  human  rights
    aspect and dismissed the appeal under the Human Rights Act as well.

13.  We note in passing at this stage that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    appears to have proceeded throughout on  the  basis  that  no  marriage
    certificate  had  been  produced  to  him  (see  paragraph  20  of  the
    determination).  In fact there was a marriage certificate  before  him.
    We have seen a copy of that  in  the  original  bundle.   There  is  no
    obvious explanation for the error of fact in this regard.  Moreover, as
    we have already noted, the Secretary of State herself has  acknowledged
    throughout the fact of marriage between the Appellant and the spouse.

Grounds of Appeal

14.  On this appeal the Appellant raises three central grounds.   The  first
    ground is that the First-tier Tribunal Judge made what is described  as
    a "fatal" error of law in failing to place the burden of proof  on  the
    Secretary of  State  and  failing  to  apply  the  correct  test  under
    Regulations 20(1) and 21(5) of the EEA Regulations.  It is pointed  out
    that in no less than three paragraphs  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    stated in terms  that  the  burden  of  proof  throughout  lay  on  the
    Appellant.  It is said that this is simply wrong as a  matter  of  law.
    Under Regulation 21 the burden of proof lies on the Secretary of State.
      Moreover it is said  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  made  no
    findings by reference to the criterion  set  out  in  Regulation  21(5)
    including the requirement that  the  personal  conduct  of  the  person
    concerned must represent a genuine  present  and  sufficiently  serious
    threat affecting one of  the  fundamental  interests  in  the  society.
    Additionally it is  said  that  the  rejection  of  evidence  from  the
    probation service was unreasoned and irrational and that there  was  no
    proper consideration of proportionality.

15.  The second and third grounds relate to the question of whether  or  not
    the  spouse  was  a  qualified  person  for  the  purpose  of  the  EEA
    Regulations :  firstly whether or not there was a genuine marriage  and
    secondly, whether or not the spouse was a worker.  What is said for the
    Appellant is that the First-tier Tribunal Judge's reasoning as  to  the
    absence of genuine marriage was flawed and  unreasoned.   Additionally,
    in dealing with the question of working,  he  failed  to  heed  witness
    statements that were available and other material evidence.

16.  The Secretary of State formally opposes  the  appeal  having  lodged  a
    Rule 24 response. However, no particular points are  taken  other  than
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge was entitled to reach the  conclusion  on
    the facts that he did.



Decision

  17. We remind ourselves that an appeal to this Tribunal only lies  on  the
      basis of an error of law (see Section 11 of the Tribunals, Courts  and
      Enforcement Act 2007 and R (Iran) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
      Department [2005] EWCA Civ 982).


18. The EEA Regulations so far as material provide as follows:

         "Regulation 17(1)

         The Secretary of State must issue a residence card to a person  who
         is not an EEA national and is the  family  member  of  a  qualified
         person or of an EEA national with a permanent  right  of  residence
         under Regulation 15 on application and production of


         (a)  a valid passport, and
         (b)  proof that the applicant is such a family member"

19. By Regulation 7 a family member includes a spouse but (by Regulation 2)
    not a party to a marriage of convenience.  By Regulation 6 a  qualified
    person is someone who is an EEA national and a worker.


20. Regulation 20(1) provides :

         "The Secretary of State may refuse to issue, revoke  or  refuse  to
         renew a registration certificate,  a  residence  card,  a  document
         certifying permanent residence or a permanent residence card if the
         refusal or revocation is justified on  grounds  of  public  policy,
         public security or public health."

21.  Regulation 21(1) provides :

         "In this Regulation a relevant decision means an EEA decision taken
         on the grounds of public policy, public security or public health."


22.  Regulation 21(2) provides


         "A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends."

23.  Regulation 21(5) provides:


         "Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public policy  or
         public security  it  shall,  in  addition  to  complying  with  the
         preceding paragraphs of this Regulation be taken in accordance with
         the following principles:


         (a)  the decision must comply with the principle of proportionality
         (b)  the decision must be based exclusively on the personal conduct
             of the person concerned
         (c)  the personal conduct of the person concerned must represent  a
             genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one
             the fundamental interests of society
         (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of  the  case  or  which
             relate to considerations of general prevention do not  justify
             the decision
         (e)  a person's previous criminal convictions do not in  themselves
             justify the decision."

24.  Regulation 21(6) provides :

         "Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds of public  policy
         or public security in relation to a person who is resident  in  the
         United  Kingdom  the  decision   maker   must   take   account   of
         considerations such  as  the  age,  state  of  health,  family  and
         economic situation of the person, the person's length of  residence
         in the United Kingdom, the person's social and cultural integration
         into the United Kingdom and the extent of the person's  links  with
         his country of origin."

25.  We turn then to the first ground of appeal.  We are persuaded that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge made a material  error  of  law.  Whilst  the
    issue is not necessarily one to be framed in terms of burden of  proof,
    there can be no doubt that it is for the Secretary of State to  justify
    the correctness of her decision by reference to the factors  identified
    in Regulation 21(5) and (6) of the EEA Regulations.   The error in this
    regard cannot be said to be immaterial, not least since the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge referred to the burden of proof lying on  the  Appellant
    on all issues no less than three times.

26.  Additionally, and perhaps more fundamentally, the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge made no proper assessment of  the  appeal  by  reference  to  the
    factors identified in Regulation 21(5) and (6) of the EEA  Regulations.
    We note that he did conclude that the risk of re-offending was  not  as
    low as the probation officer thought, but that was  a  passing  comment
    made only in the context of the separate human rights consideration.

27.  In our judgment therefore the judge made a material  error  of  law  in
    his approach to the issues arising in the appeal.

28.  That of course without more will not avail  this  Appellant  given  the
    findings in relation to the spouse.  We turn therefore to grounds 2 and
    3.

29.  Grounds 2 and 3 challenging the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  findings
    of fact are potentially more difficult.  But we are persuaded that  the
    findings  are  inadequately  reasoned  and  unacceptably  vague.    The
    evidence is dealt with  in  a  single  paragraph  as  quoted  above  at
    paragraph 10.  As for the finding in relation to marriage, as  we  have
    noted the Secretary of State herself had  accepted  there  had  been  a
    marriage.  Material evidence on the issue  was  ignored,  fundamentally
    and most obviously perhaps the marriage certificate which, contrary  to
    the  First-tier   Tribunal   Judge's   findings,   was   in   evidence.
    Additionally, there was evidence  of  a  wedding  reservation,  witness
    statements confirming  the  existence  of  a  genuine  relationship,  a
    tenancy agreement and letters of support.

30.  Although the judge stated at paragraph 21 of his judgment that he  bore
    these documents in mind, we do not anywhere find any reasoned rejection
    for their genuineness or accuracy.

31.  That then leaves the question of the finding as to whether or  not  the
    spouse was a worker.  It is not  entirely  clear  what  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge's finding on this point  was.   But  we  are  persuaded,
    looking at the evidence available as a whole, and the  brevity  of  the
    reasoning available, that insofar as he found that the spouse was not a
    worker, such finding was the product of inadequate reasoning such as to
    amount to a material error of law.

32.  We share some of the Secretary of State's concerns in relation  to  the
    spouse's working status, as reflected in  her  refusal  letter  of  3rd
    December 2013.  There are inconsistencies in some of the  documentation
    available. On the other  hand,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  heard
    evidence from the spouse's employer and heard evidence from the  spouse
    about her job as a cleaner in a bar and a waitress in a caf�.  None  of
    that is  addressed  in  any  detail  in  terms  of  being  rejected  as
    unacceptable or inadequate.

33.  In all these circumstances, having found material  errors  of  law,  we
    set aside the decision below.

34.  We then move to consider the correct  way  forward.   In  our  judgment
    both sides, that is to say the Secretary of State  and  the  Appellant,
    are entitled to a fresh and full hearing.  Justice requires that such a
    hearing in our judgment should take place in front  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  We accordingly remit this matter for that exercise now to be
    carried out.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed.  The matter is remitted  for  re-hearing  before  the
First-tier Tribunal.

No anonymity direction is made.
