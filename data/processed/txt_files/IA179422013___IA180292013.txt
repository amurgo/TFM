Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants, Muhammad Farhan Akbar (date of birth 18 July 1984)  and
    Muhammad Ahmed Mujawid (date of birth 13 February 1978) are citizens of
    Pakistan.  The appellants claim that they carry on a joint business  in
    the United Kingdom (Analog Solutions Limited) of which they  are  equal
    shareholders and directors.  The  first  appellant  claims  to  possess
    �25,000, held in a Barclays Bank  account;  the  second  appellant  has
    �25,000  in  a  Santander  Bank   account.    They   applied,   as   an
    entrepreneurial team, for further leave to remain in the United Kingdom
    as Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrants but were refused by the respondent on
    2 May 2013. The appellants appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Britton) which, in a determination  promulgated  on  23  January  2014,
    dismissed the appeal.  The appellants now appeal, with  permission,  to
    the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The applications fell to be  considered  under  HC  395  (as  amended),
    Appendix A Table 4. Of particular relevance  here  are  the  Notes  for
    Entrepreneurial Teams:

Entrepreneurial teams: Notes
52. Two applicants, and no more than two applicants, may claim points for
the same investment and business activity in Tables 4, 5 or 6 providing the
following requirements are met.
Requirements:
(a) The applicants have equal level of control over the funds and/or the
business or businesses in question;
(b) The applicants are both shown by name in each other's applications and
in the specified evidence required in the relevant table; and
(c) Neither applicant has previously been granted leave as a Tier 1
(Entrepreneur) Migrant on the basis of investment and/or business activity
linked in this way with any applicant other than each other if the same
funds are being relied on as in a previous application.
 53. (a) No points will be awarded for funds that are made available to any
individual other than the applicant, except:
(i) under the terms of paragraph 52 above; or
(ii) where the money is held in a joint account with the applicant's
spouse, civil partner or partner (defined as a person who has been living
together with the applicant in a relationship akin to a marriage or civil
partnership for at least two years prior to the date of application), and
that spouse or partner is not (or is not applying to be) another Tier 1
(Entrepreneur) Migrant.
(b) No points will be awarded for investment and business activity shared
with another Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) applicant, except under the terms of
paragraph 52 above.
(c) If the applicant is not the sole partner or director in the business,
he must state:
(i) the names of the other partners or directors,
(ii) whether any of the other partners or directors are also Tier 1
(Entrepreneur) Migrants, and
(iii) if so:
(1) the dates they became partners or directors,
(2) whether they are applying under the provisions in paragraph 52 above,
and
(3) if they have made (or are making at the same time) an application in
which they claimed points for creating jobs, the names of the jobholders in
question.

 3. In addition, the applicants were required to satisfy the provisions  of
    paragraph 41-SD.

 4. The facts of the case are not in dispute.  As the grounds state,

         the appellants could not open a joint bank account when  they  made
         their applications as all the banks that they approached asked them
         for six months' valid visa.  In such a scenario,  it  is  submitted
         that the appellants' applications were covered by paragraphs 52 and
         53 of Appendix A having the heading 'Entrepreneurial Teams: Notes'.
          It is clearly laid down in paragraph 52(a) 'that  applicants  have
         equal level of control  over  the  funds  and/or  the  business  or
         businesses in question;'.

    The appellants had made declarations in writing to the effect that each
    had an equal level of control over the funds and the business.

 5.  The  judge  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  heard  evidence  from  both
    appellants.  The judge rejected [19] new evidence  submitted  following
    the submission of the application to the respondent to the effect  that
    the appellants had now opened a joint bank account with Santander.  The
    judge found [24] that,  because  the  appellants  had  been  unable  to
    produce evidence of a joint bank account which the Tribunal could  take
    into account, the appeals must fail.  The grounds of  appeal  challenge
    that conclusion and  refer  to  the  requirement  (quoted  above)  that
    applicants should have an equal level of control over funds and/or  the
    business or businesses in question; although they did not have a  joint
    bank account, the appellants had shown that they had joint control over
    their business as evidenced by the declarations which they had made.

 6.  I  refer  to  the  requirements  of  paragraph  41-SD.  Paragraph  41-
    SD(c)(ii)(4) requires, for money held in the UK only, that "the account
    [must be] in the applicant's own  name  only  (or  both  names  for  an
    entrepreneurial team) not in the name of a business  or  third  party".
    Both appellants assert they should be  treated  as  an  entrepreneurial
    team and confirm that the funds for their business are located  in  the
    United  Kingdom  only.    It   follows,   therefore,   that   "for   an
    entrepreneurial team" the bank account for which they  had  to  produce
    original statements must be in both names of the joint applicants.  The
    appellants acknowledge that the bank accounts containing the funds upon
    which they seek to rely were held  respectively  in  their  sole  names
    only.  There existed no bank mandates authorising the  control  jointly
    and severally of either account  by  the  other  applicant.   Paragraph
    245DD is of no assistance to  the  appellants  in  the  light  of  this
    fundamental deficiency in their applications.  Accordingly,  I  do  not
    find that Judge Britton erred in law by concluding that the  appellants
    could not satisfy the Rules.  These appeals are dismissed.

DECISION

 7. These appeals are dismissed.
