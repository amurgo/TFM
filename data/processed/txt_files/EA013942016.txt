For the Appellant:     Ms E Yaemir, Darshan Azad Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of India. Her date of  birth  is  7  January
    1988.

2.   The appellant made an  application  for  a  residence  card  under  the
    Immigration  (European   Economic   Area)   Regulations   2006   ("2006
    Regulations") on 11 August 2015. The application  was  refused  by  the
    respondent because it was not accepted that the appellant's husband, Mr
    Kulvir Multani, an EEA national, was exercising treaty  rights  because
    of insufficient evidence.

3.   The appellant appealed against the  decision  of  the  respondent.  Her
    appeal was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Raymond in a decision
    promulgated on 21 August 2017, following a hearing at Hatton  Cross  on
    10 August 2017.

4.    Permission to  appeal  against  the  decision  of  Judge  Raymond  was
    granted to the appellant by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Osborne  on  13
    February 2018.

The Findings of the FtT

 5.     The judge heard evidence from the appellant and her husband.   There
    was before the judge a quantity of documentary  evidence  corroborating
    the sponsor's evidence in respect of his employment.  The evidence  was
    that the sponsor was employed by Noon Ltd. He provided for  the  appeal
    original payslips from 16 January 2015 to  13  January  2017.  He  also
    provided bank statements which show his salary crediting  his  account.
    His evidence was that he had worked for the company  as  a  Naan  Piece
    maker since 13 October 2014. There was a letter  from  the  company  in
    support of this. In addition, the appellant relied on P60s relating  to
    her husband's salary. The latest relating  to  2017  (presumably  April
    2016-April 2017) showing a gross annual income of �38,158.32.

6.       Both the appellant and her husband's oral evidence was that he  was
    employed by Noon Ltd and had been since  2011.  The  judge  on  further
    scrutiny of the bank statements identified  credits  made  by  J  Bahad
    Param "in close proximity chronologically" to the  payments  from  Noon
    Ltd.  The judge set out the oral evidence focusing in the main on  what
    was said by the appellant and the sponsor  about  those  payments.  The
    judge drew their attention to the credits.  The EEA sponsor's evidence,
    in short was that he was allowing someone else to use his bank  account
    deposit funds to buy building products to build a house.  His  evidence
    was contradictory about who was using the account, it appeared from his
    evidence that it was being used by Mr Sethi who was living with him. He
    did not know whether Mr  Sethi  was  here  illegally.  The  appellant's
    evidence was equally as incoherent and inconsistent and this issue.

7.    The judge concluded at [30] that "it was not possible to  assess  from
    coherent and understandable evidence relied on by the sponsor,  whom  I
    did not consider to be a credible and honest  witness,  and  this  also
    applies to his wife the appellant,  whether  he  is  exercising  treaty
    rights".  The judge found at [31] that the Nat West bank statement  did
    not show that it is his bank account into which  his  salary  is  paid,
    given that used extensively by someone else.  The  evidence  about  the
    identity of the person using his account was found by the judge  to  be
    incoherent and obscured what his bank account was used for and by whom.
    This was reinforced, according to the judge, by the evidence about  who
    was living in the family home. The obscurity  was  further  reinforced,
    according the judge, by the amount of the EEA national's salary of  for
    2017 which according to the judge would indicate hat he was  exercising
    some managerial or supervisory capacity but  this  was  not  consistent
    with his evidence of that he worked on a conveyor belt.

8.      The judge dismissed the claim finding that the EEA sponsor  was  not
    exercising treaty rights, summarising his reasons at [36]:

         "Because the claimed employment is almost completely  obscured  by
         perplexing and incoherent  features  which  leave  in  considerable
         doubt what it is that the sponsor is actually doing and is  seeking
         to achieve through his claimed employment"

The Grounds of Appeal

9.       The grounds argue that it was unreasonable for the judge  to  doubt
    the authenticity of the payslips or  the  bank  statements.  There  are
    regular credits into the EEA national's account which  correspond  with
    the payslips. The judge was wrong to place considerable weight  on  the
    payments made by the third party and should have focussed  on  the  EEA
    national's employment. The sponsor maintains that he is  manual  worker
    and receives 7p per naan bread and it is  not  uncommon  to  receive  a
    gross income of �38,000 in a tax year.

The Error of Law

10.      Mr Bramble conceded that the judge had  materially  erred  for  the
    reasons raised in  the  grounds.   He  indicated  that  the  presenting
    officer at the hearing had taken the view that the  evidence  that  the
    EEA national was exercising treaty rights was adequate.

11.  I conclude that  whilst  the  judge  was  entitled  to  find  that  the
    appellant and her husband were "not credible and honest,"  his  reasons
    for thus concluding must be considered in the  context  of  the  narrow
    issue in this appeal and the corroborative evidence  produced  on  that
    issue. The sole issue was whether the  EEA  national  was  a  qualified
    person. His living arrangements and relationship with  a  third  person
    whom he allows to use his bank account to deposit funds are/were a side
    issue in this case.  It was his evidence that he was  employed  and  he
    produced evidence in support of  this.  The  focus  of  the  judge  was
    distracted by the issue which the judge  raised  of  his  own  volition
    concerning the credits from J Bahad Param. The evidence  on  the  issue
    was far from satisfactory, but the distraction, in my view  caused  the
    judge to lose focus on  the  narrow  issue  in  this  case.   The  bank
    statements were in the appellant's name. There  was  no  evidence  that
    others were controlling his bank account or had access  to  his  funds.
    The evidence was that he was allowing a third party  to  deposit  funds
    into  his  account.   There  was  no  evidence  that  anyone  else  was
    withdrawing funds. In any event, there  was  cogent  and  corroborative
    evidence that the EEA was exercising Treaty rights. The  appellant  and
    the EEA national's evidence was consistent  on  this  point  and  their
    evidence was supported.  There was no evidence or  suggestion  made  by
    the respondent that the bank statements were not genuine  or  that  the
    credits from Noon Ltd related to another individual  and  not  the  EEA
    national.   The  judge  considered  immaterial  matters   and   reached
    conclusions that were not open to him on  the  evidence.     For  these
    reasons, I set aside the decision  of  Judge  Raymond  to  dismiss  the
    appellant's appeal.

12.      Mr Bramble indicated that the respondent  did  not  take  issue  in
    respect of whether the marriage was one of convenience.  I  remake  the
    decision having found that the EEA national is exercising treaty rights
    and the marriage is not one of convenience. The appeal is allowed.


13.    The appeal is allowed under the 2006 Regulations.
