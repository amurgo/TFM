                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction

 1. This is the hearing of an appeal against the decision of Judge  of  the
    First Tier Tribunal AJ Blake ("the judge") promulgated  on  26  October
    2018 following a hearing on 5 October 2018.  The judge had  allowed  an
    appeal by Mr Mark [G] against a decision of the Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department to deport him and refuse his human  rights  claims.
    This was on the basis that it would be  "unduly  harsh"  for  Mr  [G]'s
    partner and children if he was deported.

 2. The Secretary of State contends that the judge erred in his approach to
    the unduly harsh test and in assessing the  social  worker's  evidence.
    Mr [G] accepts that  the  judge  erred  in  the  approach  to  findings
    relating to Mr [G]'s partner, but  contends  that  the  judge  came  to
    conclusions open on the evidence in relation to the  children  so  that
    the error was immaterial and that the judge properly  took  account  of
    the expert evidence.

    Factual background

 3. Mr [G] is a citizen of Jamaica and was born in December 1968.   Mr  [G]
    entered the UK on 20 January 2001 with leave to remain until 8 February
    2001.  He overstayed.  In 2001 Mr [G] formed a  relationship  with  and
    subsequently married in 2010 Ms [KG].

 4. On 3 January 2007 Mr [G] was cautioned for possession of cannabis.   It
    appears that, for reasons not explained on the evidence,  Mr  [G]  used
    the alias of [LW].

 5. In early 2007 Mr [G] and Ms [KG] had a daughter, who  is  now  aged  12
    years.  On 9 December 2011 Mr [G] applied for leave  to  remain.   This
    was refused on 30 March 2012 but he was granted discretionary leave  to
    remain until 30 March 2015.

 6. On 7 March 2013 Mr [G] was arrested for possession of a  class  A  drug
    with intent to supply.

 7. In late 2013 Mr [G] and Ms [KG] had a son who is now aged 5 years.

 8. On 2 June 2014 in the Crown Court at Aylesbury Mr [G], being prosecuted
    in his alias name of [LW], was sentenced to 3 years'  imprisonment  for
    the offence of possession of cocaine, a class A drug,  with  intent  to
    supply.  The weight of the drug was just under 2 kg and it had a purity
    of 68 per cent.   The value of the drug was over ï¿½400,000.   The  judge
    put the category as between 1 and 2 for the purposes of the  sentencing
    guidelines.  Mr [G]  had  a  lesser  role,  for  the  purposes  of  the
    sentencing guidelines.  Mr [G] had pleaded guilty  and  put  forward  a
    basis of plea suggesting that he thought that the  drug  was  cannabis.
    The sentencing judge expressed a provisional view that the  submissions
    were inherently incapable of belief but the judge did not shut the door
    to a Newton hearing to determine whether the basis  of  plea  might  be
    correct.  Time for reflection was given and Mr [G] accepted that he did
    not want to pursue a Newton hearing.  Mr [G], and a co-defendant,  were
    therefore sentenced.  The judge had  regard  to  character  references,
    some of which are in the papers before me, and sentenced Mr  [G]  to  3
    years imprisonment.

 9. It appears that Mr [G] was released 5 months early on a tag in December
    2014.  He remained tagged until May 2015.

10. On 26 March 2015 solicitors acting on behalf of Mr [G] made  a  further
    application for leave to remain.  The letter recorded that Mr  [G]  was
    residing with his wife and 2  children.   Reference  was  made  to  his
    conviction and it was recorded that Mr [G] had been visited by his wife
    and children at least once a week.  There were in  the  papers  various
    documents showing continuing contact between Mr [G] and Ms [KG].

11. It was recorded that Ms [KG] found it extremely difficult to cope  with
    the children without him and obtained help from a close relative who is
    not now around because he has returned to her country.  It was recorded
    that Ms [KG] was a teacher and had her own business, relying on Mr  [G]
    to cover the lion's share of  caring  while  she  maintained  a  steady
    income.

12. The Secretary  of  State  made  a  decision  dated  3  September  2015,
    delivered on 10 September 2015, to deport Mr [G] pursuant  to  sections
    32 and 33 of the UKBA 2007.

13. Various claims were made on behalf of Mr [G] and rejected.  Mr [G]  was
    held on occasions in immigration detention.  It  appears  that  he  was
    detained from May 2016 to October 2016.  Deportation was set for 3 June
    2016.  On 2 June 2016 Mr [G] applied  for  judicial  review  which  was
    refused and certified as totally without merit.  On 3 June 2016 a claim
    for asylum was made and removal directions were deferred.

14. On 9 August 2016 an asylum interview was undertaken and  on  25  August
    2016 removal directions were set.  Removal directions were  set  for  7
    September 2016.  Further applications for judicial review were made and
    certified as being totally without merit.  It appears that Mr  [G]  was
    not removed and challenges to his detention were made.

15. On 29 September 2016  a  Child  and  Mental  Health  Service  ("CAMHS")
    practitioner wrote to Ms [KG] stating that she had been  asked  by  the
    daughter's school to contact with regard to "providing some support for
    your daughter".

16. On 7 October 2016 Ms [KG] wrote to Home  Office  and  noted  that  "our
    first child was devastated when Mark was sent to prison.  She  suffered
    mentally at his absence.  When he returned they was  great  improvement
    on her health".  The letter noted that a reference had been made  to  a
    psychiatrist and  when  Mr  [G]  was  back  the  daughter  had  quickly
    recovered and was very much her old self.  Ms [KG] also  recorded  that
    she was greatly affected and  became  depressed  when  Mr  [G]  was  in
    prison.  The letter recorded that since Mr [G] had been detained things
    have fallen apart for their family.  The daughter had relapsed and  was
    currently referred to the mental health department as she had  invented
    an imaginary dad.  The other child was always asking about  his  father
    and sometime woke at night crying for his  father.   Ms  [KG]  recorded
    that she had been very affected and had  lost  her  job  as  a  teacher
    because she could  not  concentrate.   The  letter  recorded  that  her
    daughter's mental health situation "calls for  attention",  noted  that
    relocation to Jamaica was not realistic and that "it  would  be  unduly
    harsh to deprive my children who are British citizens of the  love  and
    affection of their father when other children in the neighbourhood have
    their fathers around them".

17. By letter dated 7 October 2016 a CAMHS practitioner  for  South  London
    and Maudsley NHS Trust recorded that the daughter "has been accepted by
    the CAMHS SeaDS team in order to provide her with extra support  around
    her current emotional difficulties.  She has been  assessed  as  having
    situational anxiety and low mood and is struggling to  function  within
    her normal remit".

18. By letter dated 10 October 2016 Ms [KG] wrote again  stating  that  the
    proposed deportation was having a damaging effect on the  whole  family
    "in particular my children who are being seriously mentally affected by
    it".

19. It appears that after his release in October 2016 Mr [G]  was  detained
    from January 2017 until 6 April 2017.  Further removal directions  were
    set.  Further submissions were made including by letter from solicitors
    dated 14 February 2017.  In  the  letter  reference  was  made  to  the
    limited provision of mental health services for children in Jamaica.  A
    report dated  8  February  2017  from  Mrs  Cynthia  Kelchure-Cole  was
    attached to the letter.  She was a qualified social worker,  with  over
    30 years' experience.  She was  currently  working  as  a  social  work
    creative therapist,  using  the  creative  arts  to  obtain  children's
    feeling in a safe and secure environment.  Ms  Kelchure-Cole  confirmed
    that she understood and took  seriously  her  overriding  duty  to  the
    Court.  The report stated that it provided a voice to the  children  of
    Mr [G], and particularly his daughter.  Ms Kelchure-Cole  used  drawing
    to engage the daughter, who was described as a "bright  and  articulate
    10 year old".  Ms Kelchure-Cole interpreted  the  drawings  as  showing
    that the daughter was feeling extremely sad, demonstrated  by  her  low
    and flat presentation and drawings.  The daughter referred  to  feeling
    sad when her father was in prison, but comforted by the  fact  that  he
    would return, but sad that he would leave and she would not be able  to
    get him back.  Ms Kelchure-Cole observed a warm and loving relationship
    with the father and noted that  her  professional  view  was  that  the
    daughter was experiencing high levels of  anxiety  and  stress  due  to
    worrying about what would happen to her  father,  putting  pressure  on
    herself.

20. Ms Kelchure-Cole  referred  to  research  showing  that  children  with
    fathers in their lives were able  to  make  better  life  choices.   Ms
    Kelchure-Cole also  referred  to  research  carried  out  by  Middlesex
    University on behalf of the Children's Commissioner on  the  separation
    of children due to immigration  rules.   It  was  noted  that  children
    losing a parent by death were provided with  support  and  counselling,
    but that children losing a parent by deportation did not have access to
    such services  "until  they  develop  behaviours,  often  during  their
    teenage years, that bring them to the attention of professionals".

21. Ms  Kelchure-Cole  reported  that  "from  my  own  assessment  and  the
    assessment from CAMHS it is clear that [the daughter's] anxiety  levels
    are  extremely  high  and  that  she  will  require   ongoing   support
    surrounding her mental well-being".  The report  then  dealt  with  the
    son, the unrealistic expectation of the family  relocating  to  Jamaica
    and the impact on relationships if Mr [G] was deported.

22.  In  the  conclusion  Ms  Kelchure-Cole   reported   "in   asking   for
    reconsideration to allow Mr [G] to remain in the UK I have  taken  into
    account his criminal offence and conviction, with the awareness that in
    some circumstances the  safeguarding  and  well-being  of  society  can
    outweigh the rights of the child.  However, Mr [G] does not have a long
    history of offending and ... and he said that he has  learnt  from  his
    experience".

23. Mr [G] was granted bail on 5  or  6  April  2017  and  was  then  later
    detained and again granted bail.  On 11 May 2017 a  CAMHS  practitioner
    wrote noting that on  Mr  [G]'s  release  the  daughter's  mood  lifted
    dramatically, although there remained  mild  anxiety  about  him  being
    taken away again.  Plans were made to end the sessions but Mr  [G]  was
    detained again and the effect  on  the  daughter  was  reported  to  be
    dramatic as she was very distressed and barely slept and  worried.  The
    daughter was unable to attend school on several days, and  her  anxiety
    lessened only when she was able to have daily  contact  on  the  phone.
    The daughter's mood lifted again on Mr [G]'s return home, with  anxiety
    on days that he had to sign on.  The letter concluded that "the  impact
    of having her father removed had a detrimental effect"  the  daughter's
    mental and physical wellbeing.

24. By letter dated  11  May  2017  to  Ms  [KG]  from  the  "psychological
    therapies and wellbeing service" it was noted that scores had indicated
    that she had moderate depression  and  severe  anxiety.   The  problems
    reported were low mood and stress.

25. Julie Meek, an independent social worker, produced a short report dated
    4 April 2017.  Ms  Meek  reported  that  she  had  been  instructed  to
    undertake an assessment into the effect on the daughter and son  should
    Mr [G] be deported to Jamaica.  Ms  Meek  had  worked  with  children's
    services for 10 years.  She had spoken with Mr [G] and interviewed  the
    others.   Mr [G] reported the children's disappointment when he had not
    been granted bail.  Ms  [KG]  reported  the  effect  of  absences  from
    nursery for the son, when she had been unable to take him, and the fact
    that the daughter's homework was suffering even though she remained  in
    the top set.  Mr [G] had assisted with that and there  were  days  when
    the daughter did not want to go to school  because  she  was  down  and
    upset about her dad.  The  daughter  expressed  concern  that  she  was
    worried about her dad and him being deported to Jamaica.  Ms Meek  said
    "although there needs to be a full assessment undertaken to assess  all
    of this in more detail, it is clear from the initial conversations that
    I have had" that Mr [G] had a close relationship with his children  and
    they were missing him and that his absence  was  having  an  effect  on
    their emotional well-being.  Mr [G]'s absence was also having an impact
    on the children's education.

26. Ms Meek produced a more detailed report dated 10 May 2017 dealing  with
    the effect on the children should be Mr [G] be  deported.   Information
    was obtained from phone calls and two home visits.   Mr  [G]  described
    how he dealt with the children while his  wife  worked.   He  had  also
    carried out the household work and had had to catch up with matters  on
    his release.  Mr [G] reported that the children  had  had  issues  with
    school when he was detained.  Ms [KG]  was  reported  to  ask  why  the
    children had to suffer, Mr [G] had served his time and  yet  they  were
    all being punished because of Mr [G]'s immigration situation.  Ms  Meek
    noted the previous reports on the daughter and the work from CAMHS  and
    noted a change in the daughter's behaviour with  Mr  [G]  around.   The
    daughter reported that everyone else had their father  around  even  if
    they did not live with them whereas her father has been far away.   The
    daughter's teacher reported a marked improvement in behaviour when  her
    father was back.  Ms Meek  noted  that  children  needed  routines  and
    stability to thrive and the fact that Mr  [G]  could  be  detained  was
    impacting them all emotionally.  The children could not live in Jamaica
    as they were settled in the UK.  Mr [G]'s  deportation  would  have  "a
    significant detrimental emotional and physical impact" on the children.

27. In the report at paragraph 2.7 Ms Meek set out Mr [G]'s statement about
    his arrest saying that he had been asked by a friend  to  pick  up  the
    friend's girlfriend from the airport who, unknown to him, was  carrying
    drugs.

28. Further submissions were made and rejected.  On 14  November  2017  the
    Secretary of State notified Mr [G] that his protection claim  had  been
    refused and that the decision to deport him was being maintained.

    Proceedings before the Judge and the decision

29. The appeal to the judge was on the basis that the  Secretary  of  State
    had failed adequately to assess Mr [G]'s family and private  life  with
    his partner and two children, had failed to have  regard  to  the  best
    interests of the children, and had failed to consider  whether  Mr  [G]
    would be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment  if  returned  to
    Jamaica.   At  the  beginning  of  the  appeal  the  asylum  claim  was
    withdrawn.  This meant that the appeal concerned the deportation  order
    and paragraphs 398 and 399A of the Immigration Rules and section 117A-D
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act").

30. The Judge set out the sentencing remarks and Mr [G]'s evidence.  Mr [G]
    said that he had left Jamaica after problems between Tivoli Gardens and
    Wilton Gardens.  Mr  [G]  claimed  that  the  problems  were  gang  and
    politically based.  Mr [G] claimed that there  was  a  radio  broadcast
    which he had associated himself with after refusing attempts to recruit
    him.  He had become a Rastafarian, and escaped from  Jamaica  in  2001.
    He had then lived in the Rastafarian community in London before meeting
    his wife in 2006.

31. Mr [G] said that he was a married man with  two  children,  a  daughter
    born in 2007 and a son born on 15 November 2013.  Mr [G] said  that  he
    told his wife that he was an overstayer in 2009 and she  had  suggested
    marriage and that this  might  regularise  his  stay  in  the  UK,  see
    paragraph 65 of the judgment.  Mr [G] admitted going to Jamaica in 2012
    and 2013, as well as going to Ghana or Ethiopia.  He said  he  had  got
    into problems over ï¿½100 and had been made to pick  up  drugs.   Mr  [G]
    said he did not know there were drugs in the bag.  Mr [G] said  he  had
    been railroaded.  Mr [G] said  that  both  of  his  children  had  been
    affected by his imprisonment.  He said his removal would  have  a  very
    bad effect on his wife and children.

32. Ms [KG] gave evidence that she had met Mr [G] in  2006.   She  did  not
    want to live in Jamaica because it was violent and she  had  no  family
    there.  The education was not good unless you could pay privately.  She
    worked on a market stall and with a shop and  Mr  [G]  helped  her  and
    looked after the children. The children and she had suffered because of
    his imprisonment.  Mr [G] had looked at a property in 2013 but she  had
    made it clear she would not go there.  Mr [G] saw  his  daughter  every
    day and she was worried about anxiety for her son.  Ms [KG]  said  that
    her mother was selfish and had not helped.

33. The Judge set out relevant provisions of  the  law  before  turning  to
    relevant findings of fact.  The Judge recorded  that  Mr  [G]  was  "44
    years at the time of his first and only recorded offence".   The  Judge
    found that Mr [G] was "truly contrite for his offending and the  effect
    it had had on his family".   The  Judge  also  recorded  Mr  [G]'s  co-
    operation with the police.

34. The details of the family were set out  in  the  judgment.   The  judge
    referred to the report from Ms Kelchure-Cole  and  the  statement  that
    relocation  was  not  a  realistic  option.   The  judge  recorded  the
    separation anxiety noted in the son  and  the  daughter's  feelings  of
    hopelessness and feeling so sad that she could  hardly  bear  it.   The
    judge noted  the  reference  to  the  research  showing  that  children
    separated by immigration rules suffered distress  and  high  levels  of
    anxiety over a period of time.

35. The Judge found exception 2 set out in section 117C(5) of the 2002  Act
    and paragraph 399 of the Immigration Rules applied.   The  Judge  found
    that both wife and children were qualified under section  117D  of  the
    2002 Act.  The Judge recorded that deportation had "to  be  established
    to be unduly harsh" and referred to MM (Uganda) v SSHD [2016] EWCA  Civ
    617.  The Judge recorded that seriousness "was often reflected  in  the
    severity of the sentence.  I took into account that in the  appellant's
    case his sentence had been one  of  3  years.   I  noted  that  in  his
    sentencing remarks the judge had attributed a lesser role to him in the
    nature of the overall offending".

36. The judge said that "what amounted to something being unduly harsh upon
    a qualifying individual had to be weighed against the public  interest,
    which  would  include  the  circumstances  of  the  offence   and   any
    aggravating features".

37. The judge accepted that his  family  life  with  his  partner  met  the
    requirements set out in paragraph 399(b) of the IR.   The  Judge  noted
    the genuine relationship with the wife and children, and noted that his
    imprisonment had had far reaching effects on both of his children,  and
    that a reference had been made to CAMHS.  The Judge found it  would  be
    unduly harsh to require the family to live in Jamaica and unduly  harsh
    for them to remain in the UK if the appellant were to be deported.   He
    noted the stress and anxiety and found that "removal  would  have  far-
    reaching consequences on the welfare of his wife  and  children".   The
    Judge concluded stating "I took into account section 117C of  the  2002
    Act.  I noted that the Appellant had only  committed  one  offence  and
    that the evidence established that he was contrite."




    Relevant provisions

38. Sections 32 and 33 of the UK Borders Act 2007 provide for the making of
    deportation orders against foreign criminals who have been sentenced to
    longer  than  12  months  imprisonment.    Sections   117A-D   of   the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 deal with article 8 of the
    ECHR and public interest considerations.  It might be noted that "in  a
    case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the public  interest
    does not require the person's  removal  where  (a)  the  person  has  a
    genuine or subsisting parental relationship with  a  qualifying  child,
    and (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave  the
    UK".

39. The Immigration rules provide in relation to deportation and Article 8

         398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary
         to the UK's  obligations  under  Article  8  of  the  Human  Rights
         Convention, and ...

             (b)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
             the public good and in the public interest because  they  have
             been  convicted  of  an  offence  for  which  they  have  been
             sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but
             at least 12 months; or

         399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c)  applies
         if -

             (a)   the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
             relationship with a child under the age of 18 years who is  in
             the UK, and

                  (i)  the child is a British Citizen; or

                  (ii) the child has lived in the  UK  continuously  for  at
                  least the 7 years immediately preceding the  date  of  the
                  immigration decision; and in either case

                      (a)  it would be unduly harsh for the child  to  live
                      in the country to which the person is to be deported;
                      and

                      (b)  it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain
                      in the UK without the person who is to  be  deported;
                      or

             (b)  the person has a genuine and subsisting relationship with
             a partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen or settled
             in the UK, and

                  (i)  the relationship was formed at a time when the person
                  (deportee) was in the UK lawfully  and  their  immigration
                  status was not precarious; and

                  (ii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live  in
                  the country to which the person is to be deported, because
                  of compelling circumstances over and above those described
                  in paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM; and

                  (iii)    it would be unduly  harsh  for  that  partner  to
                  remain in the UK without the person who is to be deported.




    Section 117A - C of the 2002 Act provides, so far as is relevant:

         (1)  This Part applies where a court or  tribunal  is  required  to
         determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-

             (a)  breaches a person's right  to  respect  for  private  and
             family life under Article 8, and

             (b)  as a result would be unlawful  under  section  6  of  the
             Human Rights Act 1998.

         (2)  In considering the public  interest  question,  the  court  or
         tribunal must (in particular) have regard-

             (a)  in all cases, to the  considerations  listed  in  section
             117B, and

             (b)  in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals,
             to the considerations listed in section 117C.

         (3)  In subsection (2), "the public interest  question"  means  the
         question of whether  an  interference  with  a  person's  right  to
         respect for private and family  life  is  justified  under  Article
         8(2).

         117B Article 8: public interest considerations  applicable  in  all
         cases

         (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in  the
         public interest.

         (2)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are  able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

             (a)  are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

         (3)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
         financially independent, because such persons-

             (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

         (4)  Little weight should be given to-

             (a)  a private life, or

             (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

             that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is
             in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5)  Little weight should be given to a private life established by
         a person  at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration  status  is
         precarious.

         (6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-

             (a)   the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
             the United Kingdom.

         117C  Article  8:  additional  considerations  in  cases  involving
         foreign criminals

         (1)   The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
         interest.

         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.

         (3)  In the case of a foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,  the
         public interest requires C's  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
         Exception 2 applies.

         (4)  Exception 1 applies where-

             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the  United  Kingdom  for
             most of C's life,

             (b)  C is socially and culturally  integrated  in  the  United
             Kingdom, and

             (c)   there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   C's
             integration into the country to which  C  is  proposed  to  be
             deported.

         (5)  Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

40. As is apparent from the provisions set out above paragraph 398  of  the
    Immigration Rules deals with deportation  and  article  8.   The  Rules
    apply whether a  foreign  criminal  claims  his  deportation  would  be
    contrary  to  UK's  obligations  under  article  8.   In  any  decision
    affecting children the best interests of the children must be a primary
    (but not the paramount) consideration but they can be outweighed by the
    cumulative  effect  of  other  considerations,  see  ZH  (Tanzania)   v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 4; [2011]  2  AC
    166 at paragraphs 27 to 28.  Paragraph 399(a) provides that, in certain
    circumstances if "it would be unduly harsh" for  the  child  either  to
    live in the country to which would be deported or to live  without  the
    person who is to be deported.  It is common ground that  there  were  2
    qualifying children in this case.

41. The meaning of "unduly harsh"  has  been  considered  in  a  number  of
    authorities.  In MK Sierra Leone [2015] UKUT 00223 (IAC) it  was  noted
    at paragraph 46 that "unduly harsh" does not equate with uncomfortable,
    inconvenient or merely difficult ... "harsh" in this  context,  denotes
    something severe, or bleak ... the  addition  of  the  adverb  "unduly"
    raises an already elevated standard  still  higher.   In  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department v AJ [2016] EWCA Civ 1012; [2017] Imm  AR
    442 it was noted at paragraph 17 that "it will be  rare  for  the  best
    interests of the children to outweigh the  strong  public  interest  in
    deporting foreign criminals".   This  was  approved  in  KO(Nigeria)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] UKSC 53; [2018] 1 WLR
    5273.  At paragraph 23 it was noted that the judge needed to look for a
    degree of  harshness  going  beyond  that  what  would  necessarily  be
    involved for any child faced with the deportation of a parent.  This is
    because the regime suggests that there is "a degree of harshness  going
    beyond what would necessarily be involved for any child faced with  the
    deportation of a parent".  It  is  not  necessary  to  establish  "very
    compelling reasons" which applies in certain other situations.

    Error of law in relation to the partner

42. It is common ground that the judge made an error in  paragraph  128  of
    the decision in finding that Mr [G]'s relationship with his partner was
    a qualifying relationship.  This is because Mr [G]'s immigration status
    was at all material times  precarious.   However  it  was  also  common
    ground that if there was no error made by the judge in relation to  the
    decision in relation to the children the error about Mr  [G]'s  partner
    would not affect the case.  This is because Mr [G]'s deportation  would
    still not be permissible under the relevant rules.

43. It is right to note  that  the  judge  appeared  to  balance  interests
    between the public interest in deportation  and  article  8  rights  in
    paragraph 130 of the judgment.  For the  reasons  explained  in  KO  at
    paragraph 12 the rules, as now amended, attempt  to  provide  for  that
    balance and for consistency.  There  are  differences  in  approach  to
    balancing the interests of society in deporting foreign  criminals  and
    the interests of qualifying family members, depending  on  whether  the
    relevant person has been sentenced to less than a year, 12 months to  4
    years, and over 4 years.  For those sentenced to  over  12  months  but
    less than 4 years, as was Mr [G], the bar is set at unduly harsh either
    on a qualifying partner or the children.  Following  the  approach  set
    out in the rules should avoid the need  to  enter  into  the  balancing
    exercise.

44. In undertaking  the  analysis  of  the  respective  balance  the  judge
    minimised the scale of Mr [G]'s offending.  This was  because  he  said
    that Mr [G] had committed only one offence  in  paragraph  120  of  the
    decision when he had a caution for possession of cannabis.  On its  own
    this would not have been a material error.  However the judge  went  on
    to find that Mr [G] was truly contrite for his offending  in  paragraph
    121 of the decision.  The difficulty with this  approach  is  that  the
    judge appeared to have accepted Mr [G]'s evidence that he did not  know
    that there were drugs in the bag and had  been  told  to  plead  guilty
    because he had the bag in his possession without confronting whether Mr
    [G] was given such advice, how this could be reconciled with  Mr  [G]'s
    initial basis of plea that he thought the drugs were cannabis  and  not
    cocaine, and Mr  [G]'s  subsequent  acceptance  that  that  was  not  a
    sustainable basis of plea by withdrawing it before a Newton hearing was
    ordered.

45. Further the judge appeared at paragraph 132 of the judgment to  suggest
    that because the offence had occurred late in Mr  [G]'s  life  and  had
    been committed because of financial pressure it was less serious.  This
    ignored the fact that this was a very  serious  offence  of  possession
    with intent to supply class A drugs.  The proper question for the judge
    to approach was whether removal would be unduly harsh for the children.

46. In that respect the judge asserted that removal would be  unduly  harsh
    but did not take any detailed analysis of why that would be.  There was
    no consideration of what made this case more than "harsh" which, as has
    been pointed out in previous decisions, is a  permissible  interference
    with Mr [G] and his family's article 8 rights.  It seemed  to  us  that
    the  judge's  approach  was  similar  to  the  impermissible   approach
    identified in AJ at paragraph 49 in concentrating on article  8  rights
    and not on the what would be "unduly harsh".

    Disposal

47. During part of the appeal we considered whether to allow the appeal and
    re-make the decision that deportation would not  be  unduly  harsh  and
    therefore permissible.  However we were persuaded that there is in this
    case some suggestion that there may be mental disorders suffered by the
    children which might, depending on the nature and extent of the  mental
    disorders, mean that it would be unduly harsh to  remove  Mr  [G].   We
    noted that the reports by the social workers were out of date, and that
    there was no expert medical evidence about the  mental  disorders.   We
    should state that it seemed to us proper expert  medical  evidence  was
    likely to be required if reliance were to be placed on any evidence  of
    a mental disorder.  Given this conclusion it  seemed  to  us  right  to
    allow the appeal and to remit the decision to the First  Tier  Tribunal
    so that the matter can  be  fairly  determined  on  the  evidence  then
    available.

48. We should say  that  the  parties  should  liaise  and  co-operate,  in
    accordance with their duties under the  Tribunal  Rules,  and  identify
    what expert evidence is required to be adduced on one  or  both  sides.
    It may be necessary for the parties to agree directions to provide  for
    such evidence.
