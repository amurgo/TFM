                                                                 Respondents


    Representation:


                           For the appellant: Ms J Isherwood a Senior
           Home Office Presenting Officer
                           For the respondents: Mr Z Khan a solicitor
           from Universal Solicitors

                           WITHDRAWAL AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is the Entry  Clearance  Officer.  The  respondents  are
      citizens of Bangladesh and respectively husband, wife  and  their  son
      ("the claimants"). Their applications for visitor visas  were  refused
      by the Entry Clearance Officer on 1 October 2012.


   2. The claimants appealed and the judge heard their appeals on  27  March
      2013, allowing the appeals in a reasoned determination dated to  April
      2013.


   3. The Entry Clearance Officer  sought  and  was  granted  permission  to
      appeal on the basis that  the  Immigration  Appeals  (Family  Visitor)
      Regulations 2012 ("the 2012 Regulations") which came into force  on  9
      July 2012 meant that because the first claimant said that he wanted to
      visit his uncle and uncles did not come within the new class of  those
      who had a right of appeal the claimants had no rights  of  appeal  and
      the judge should not have considered the appeals.


   4. Part way through the hearing before me and after a  close  examination
      of the application forms Ms Isherwood conceded that the  grounds  were
      misconceived. Whilst the sponsor is the  first  claimant's  uncle  the
      first claimant said in his application form that he intended to  visit
      his wife's brother. The second claimant  said  that  she  intended  to
      visit her brother. The third claimant said that he intended  to  visit
      his grandfather. All these  are  persons  who  come  within  the  2012
      Regulations.


   5. Ms Isherwood informed me that the Entry Clearance  Officer  wished  to
      withdraw the appeal to the Upper Tribunal and that part of  the  case.
      Mr Khan agreed that this should be  done.  I  record  that  under  the
      provisions of rule 17 (1) of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
      Rules 2008 the Entry Clearance Officer gave notice at the  hearing  of
      the withdrawal of the appeal to the Upper Tribunal and  that  part  of
      the case. I consent to this withdrawal under rule  17  (2).  I  direct
      that the Entry Clearance Officer's appeal to the Upper Tribunal  shall
      be treated as withdrawn. This means that the decision  of  the  First-
      Tier Tribunal Judge allowing the claimants' appeals stands.
