                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the 1st Appellant:             Ms S H McKeeve, of McGlashan MacKay,
Solicitors
For the 2nd Appellant:             Mr M Templeton, of Quinn, Martin &
Langan, Solicitors
For the Respondent:                Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office
Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants appeal against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    David C Clapham SSC, promulgated on 7 June 2018.

 2. Mr Govan conceded that the grounds showed that central issues  of  fact
    were left unresolved; a legally inadequate explanation  was  given  for
    the outcome; and the decision could not be saved on grounds of internal
    relocation, because the unresolved contentions of the appellants  went,
    in part, to the reach of the alleged persecutors.

 3. Parties agreed that the outcome should be as follows.

 4. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.

 5. The nature of the case is such that it is appropriate under section  12
    of the 2007 Act, and under Practice Statement 7.2, to remit to the  FtT
    for an entirely fresh hearing.

 6. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Clapham.

 7. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
