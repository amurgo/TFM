                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge  Crawford  promulgated  on  3rd  May  2013.  Judge   Crawford
        dismissed the appeal against the refusal of the Secretary of  State
        to vary the appellant's leave so as to permit him to remain in  the
        United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant under both the
        Immigration Rules and Article 8 ECHR.



Discussion



     2. The appellant was born on the 18th February 1983 and is  a  citizen
        of India. His immigration history shows he first entered the United
        Kingdom on 17th January 2006 in possession of visa conferring leave
        to remain until 31st January 2007. He was granted  further  periods
        of leave to remain, the most recent being from 4th May  2010  until
        4th May 2012 as a Tier 1 (Post-study Work)  Migrant.   On  4th  May
        2012 he made a further application for leave to remain as a Tier  4
        (General) Student Migrant which was refused on 16th  November  2012
        as the appellant scored no points in  respect  of  the  maintenance
        requirements.


     3. Judge Crawford noted that the appellant was required to show he had
        �7,200 for a consecutive 28 day period in  his  bank  account  with
        statements produced no earlier than thirty one days before the date
        of the application. The appellant provided a bank statement in  his
        father's name from HDFC Bank and another from  Punjab  Gramin  Bank
        although this  latter  bank  is  not  on  the  list  of  acceptable
        financial institutions listed in  Appendix  P  of  the  Immigration
        Rules. The closing date of the balance on the bank letter submitted
        from HDFC Bank was also 31st March 2012, more than one month  prior
        to the application which meant such funds could not be  taken  into
        account when calculating the available maintenance.


     4. Judge Crawford also noted that the funds  in  the  HDFC  bank  only
        amounted to �2,297.11 and were insufficient in any event.


     5. In relation to Article 8 the Judge refers to the  Razgar  test  and
        stated he was satisfied that the refusal to the points-based system
        was a proportionate response commensurate with the United Kingdom's
        right to control immigration which did not breach  the  appellant's
        Article 8 rights.


     6. The grounds of appeal, drafted by the  appellant  in  person,  only
        challenge the Article 8 decision claiming he has spent seven  years
        and six months in the United Kingdom. He entered  when  he  was  23
        years of age to study and finished his degree in 2010 and asks that
        his rights under Article 8 be considered.


     7. The case of Rodriquez [2013] UKUT 00042 is mentioned in  the  grant
        of permission to appeal. This case refers to a policy  operated  by
        UKBA since August 2009 indicating that where mandatory evidence was
        missing from an  application  an  applicant  should  be  given  the
        opportunity to provide this. It was said to UKBA has a  public  law
        duty to give effect to  this  policy  in  all  cases  to  which  it
        applies. Rodriquez is subject to an appeal to the Court  of  Appeal
        as it is said to be contrary to that Court's decision in  Alam  and
        Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ
        960 in which the Court of Appeal said that  the  exclusion  of  new
        evidence introduced by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
        2002 s.85A applied to all appeals made after the  date  that  s.85A
        was brought into force and, in any event, the policy referred to in
        that case has been withdrawn.


     8. The respondent's current position, as from 6th September  2012,  is
        to be found in paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules which  sets
        out specific circumstances in which the  Secretary  of  State  will
        refer back to an applicant for additional information.  It has  not
        been proved on the facts that this is  such  a  case.  I  find  the
        decision is lawful. The appellant produced evidence from his father
        from the HDFC account which did not contain the required  level  of
        funding and sought to rely upon a second  account  which  does  not
        meet the requirements of the Rules. It has not been proved that  in
        dismissing the appeal on this basis the Judge legally erred.


     9. In relation to Article 8 although the Judge mentions  Razgar  there
        is little analysis of the various questions to be considered in the
        determination and the fact it was found that the refusal under  the
        Rules was proportionate is not the same  test  as  to  whether  the
        decision is  proportionate  when  balanced  against  the  protected
        rights of the appellant; although the key question is  whether  the
        dismissal of the appeal on this ground was a finding  open  to  the
        Judge in any event. If it is any error is not material.


    10. The appellant was asked about his Article  8  rights  and  confirms
        that he has no family life in the United Kingdom. He states he  has
        a British girlfriend who he has been going out with for one  and  a
        half years although she was not in court and there is  no  evidence
        to corroborate this claim. It is accepted that  the  appellant  did
        not tell Judge Crawford about any such relationship  and  therefore
        there can be no error in any failure to deal with it.  I  find  the
        appellant has not proved he has family life recognised by Article 8
        in the United Kingdom.


    11. In relation to his private life, he stated  that  he  has  friends,
        plays for a sports team, and has  associates  he  has  met  through
        work, although again there were no details provided to  the  Judge.
        All Judge Crawford appears to have had is an indication of the time
        the appellant has spent in the United Kingdom.


    12. Whether the grounds of appeal referred to Article 8  or  not,  this
        was an issue dealt with by Judge Crawford. On the limited  evidence
        he had available it would have been difficult for him to carry  out
        any form of detailed assessment. His finding that it  is  not  been
        proved that Article 8 was engaged therefore appears to be a finding
        within the range of those open to him to  make  on  that  evidence.
        Having heard the appellant outline the nature of his  private  life
        and weighing this against the fact that he has only  had  temporary
        leave  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  with   no   legitimate
        expectation that it will be made permanent, the legitimate  aim  of
        workable immigration controls based upon the  economic  welfare  of
        the United Kingdom, and all the facts considered  with  appropriate
        care, I find that the respondent has discharged the burden of proof
        upon her to the required standard to show that even if Article 8 is
        engaged in relation to the appellant's private life,  the  decision
        is proportionate. I therefore find Judge  Crawford's  dismissal  of
        the Article 8 ECHR claim shall stand.


    13. The  refusal  contains  a  direction  for  the  appellants  removal
        pursuant to section 47 Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act  2006
        which, based upon the law in force at the date of decision, is  not
        in accordance with the  law.   Judge  Crawford  makes  no  specific
        finding in relation to this aspect  and  erred  in  dismissing  the
        appeal out right.  I  set  aside  the  determination  although  the
        dismissal of the appellants appeal under the Immigration Rules  and
        Article 8 shall  stand  as  preserved  findings.  I  substituted  a
        decision to allow the appeal to the limited extent it  is  remitted
        to the Secretary of State for a  lawful  removal  direction  to  be
        made.


Decision

    14. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. This appeal  is  allowed  to  the  limited  extent  it  is
        remitted to the Secretary of State for a lawful  removal  direction
        to be made.


   Anonymity.


    15. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.
