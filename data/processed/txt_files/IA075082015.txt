                                                                  Respondent

Representation:
Appellant   Mr Diwnycz (Home Office Presenting Officer)
Respondent  Mr Sharma (Legal representative)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The respondent in these proceedings was  the  appellant  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal. From hereon I  have  referred  to  the  parties
       accordingly so that for example reference to  the  respondent  is  a
       reference to the Secretary of State for the Home Department.

    2. The Appellant is a citizen  of  India.  The  appellant  entered  the
       United Kingdom on June 20, 2014. On November 3, 2014 she applied for
       a residence card, as the spouse of an EEA national exercising treaty
       rights, pursuant to  Regulation  17  of  the  Immigration  (European
       Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006.  The  respondent   refused   her
       application in a decision dated February 19, 2015.

    3. The appellant appealed this decision  on  February  26,  2015  under
       section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002
       and Regulation 26 of the 2006 Regulations.

    4. The appeal came before Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Colyer  on
       June 17, 2015 and in a decision  promulgated  on  July  2,  2015  he
       allowed the appeal under Regulation 15 of the 2006 Regulations.

    5. The respondent lodged grounds of appeal on July 7,  2015  submitting
       the First-tier Judge had erred by  allowing  the  appeal  under  the
       wrong Regulations. In doing so he had given the appellant  permanent
       residence as against a residence card.

    6. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Grant-Hutchinson gave permission to
       appeal on this point.

    7. The matter came before  me  on  the  above  date  and  I  asked  the
       appellant's representative whether he opposed  the  application.  He
       confirmed he did not and accepted the Judge had erroneously  granted
       permanent residence under Regulation 15 as against simply granting a
       residence card under regulation 17.

    8. In the circumstances I found there had been an error in law  to  the
       extent that the appeal had been allowed under the  wrong  provision.
       Mr Diwnycz did not argue the decision to grant a residence card.

    9. The First-tier Tribunal did not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
       pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
       2008 I make no order now.

DECISION

   10. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve
       the making of an error on a point of law. I set aside the First-tier
       Tribunal's  decision  and  I  remake  allowing  the   appeal   under
       Regulation 17 of the 2006 Regulations.
