Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Symes, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1.   The appellant is a citizen of the Philippines born on 13 April 1975,
      who has appealed with the permission of the Upper Tribunal  against  a
      decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Callow, who dismissed her
      appeal against a decision of the respondent  to  refuse  to  vary  her
      leave to remain.


   2.   The appellant came to the UK on 29 January 2009 in order  to  study.
      She was granted an extension of stay in that capacity until 4 February
      2013. On 28 January 2013 she made an in-time application to  vary  her
      leave by filing form  FLR(O).  She  provided  evidence  that  she  had
      married Mr Jack Wallace, a British citizen born  on  9  December  1958
      ("the sponsor") on 26 July 2012. In the covering letter sent with  the
      application, the appellant's legal  representatives  acknowledged  the
      appellant did not meet the financial or English language  requirements
      of E-LTRP of Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules,  HC395.   Reliance
      was  placed  on  paragraph  EX.1(b)  that  there  were  insurmountable
      obstacles to family life continuing outside the UK.  The  sponsor  has
      two children from his previous marriage whom he sees regularly. He has
      lived in the UK all his life. His friends and siblings are in the  UK.
      He requires regular and specialist treatment for his heart  condition.
      Furthermore, the appellant is an orphan and has very few ties with the
      Philippines.


   3.   The respondent refused the application  because  family  life  could
      continue outside the UK. The appellant appealed.


   4.    Judge Callow heard evidence from the appellant and the sponsor. The
      respondent was not represented at the hearing. The judge noted that it
      was common ground the appellant  could  not  meet  the  financial  and
      English language requirements of Appendix FM (paragraph 10). He turned
      to the question of whether  there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to
      family life outside the  UK.  He  found  the  appellant  was  fit  and
      competent to work and had lived most of her life in  the  Philippines,
      where she had a brother and sister (paragraph 14). She had  only  been
      in the UK a relatively short time. He found the sponsor had suffered a
      number of heart attacks over the years, the last of which was in  July
      2013. He  was  undoubtedly  in  a  subsisting  relationship  with  the
      appellant. He was born and bred in the UK and was in close touch  with
      his  three  adult  children  and  grandchildren.  It   was   perfectly
      understandable he would wish to continue to live in the  UK  with  the
      appellant. However, it had not been shown that his propensity to heart
      attacks was an obstacle impossible  to  surmount.  The  appellant  had
      accepted there were suitable medical facilities and treatment  in  the
      Philippines. The appellant could, possibly with some hardship,  secure
      employment to provide for the sponsor in the Philippines. In  sum,  he
      found the appellant did not meet the requirements of paragraph EX.1.


   5.   Judge Callow then considered the claim that removing  the  appellant
      in consequence of the decision would  breach  her  and  the  sponsor's
      right to family life on article 8 principles outside the rules. On the
      issue of proportionality  he  concluded  in  paragraph  26,  that  the
      appellant could return to the Philippines to make an  application  for
      entry  clearance.  The  hypothetical  removal  of  the  appellant  was
      proportionate.


   6.   Three grounds were submitted arguing the judge  had  erred  in  law.
      Firstly, the judge erred by applying the insurmountable obstacles test
      rather than the correct legal test which was  one  of  reasonableness.
      Secondly, the judge erred by failing to identify a sensible reason for
      requiring the appellant to  return  to  the  Philippines  to  make  an
      application for entry clearance  (Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department v Hayat [2012] EWCA Civ 1054). Thirdly, he failed  to  take
      into consideration when assessing  proportionality,  relevant  matters
      such as the extent of the sponsor's heart problems, the  deterioration
      in  the  sponsor's  mental  health,  the  nature  and  extent  of  his
      relationships with his children, the  ability  of  the  appellant  and
      sponsor to work in the UK to avoid recourse to public funds (MM, R (On
      the application of) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
      [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin)) and the lack of available  accommodation  in
      the Philippines.


   7.   Permission to appeal was refused  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  but
      granted on renewal by the Upper Tribunal.

   8.   The respondent has not filed a response opposing the appeal.


   9.   I heard submissions on the question of  whether  the  judge  made  a
      material error of law requiring his decision to be set aside. Mr Symes
      built on his written grounds. He argued the judge misdirected  himself
      in law in his application of an "ultra-high"  test  of  whether  there
      were 'insurmountable obstacles' to family life continuing outside  the
      UK. The correct test was whether there were serious obstacles and,  in
      a case in which the appellant had an impeccable  immigration  history,
      the test was closer to one  of  reasonableness.  The  judge  erred  by
      applying too high a threshold and viewing  the  evidence  through  the
      wrong lens. Mr Nath argued the judge had  directed  himself  correctly
      and had looked at all the relevant factors in  assessing  whether  the
      possibility of relocation was practical.


  10. I announced my decision  to  set  aside  the  determination  of  Judge
      Callow. My reasons were as follows.


  11. Paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM of the rules reads as follows:

         "EX.1. This paragraph applies if
         ...


            (b) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with
            a partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled  in
            the  UK  or  in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or  humanitarian
            protection, and there are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family
            life with that partner continuing outside the UK."


  12. The key issue is the correct meaning  of  "insurmountable  obstacles".
      The guidance provided in the IDIs is set out in paragraph 11 of  Judge
      Callow's determination and  summarised  in  paragraph  13  of  Gulshan
      (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT  00640  (IAC)as
      follows:


         "Insurmountable obstacles" are dealt with in  paragraph  3.2.7c  of
         the Guidance. This states that the decision-maker  should  consider
         the seriousness of the difficulties which the applicant  and  their
         partner would face in continuing  their  family  life  outside  the
         United Kingdom, and whether they entail something  that  could  not
         (or could not be expected to) be overcome, even with  a  degree  of
         hardship for one or more of the individuals concerned. It  is  said
         to be a different and more stringent  assessment  than  whether  it
         would be "reasonable to expect" the  applicant's  partner  to  join
         them overseas. For example, a British Citizen partner who has lived
         in the UK all their life and speaks only English may  not  wish  to
         uproot and relocate halfway across the world,  "but  a  significant
         degree  of  hardship  or  inconvenience  does  not  amount  to   an
         insurmountable obstacle".  The decision-maker is advised to look at
         whether there is an inability to live in the country concerned. The
         focus should also be on the family life which would be  enjoyed  in
         the country to  which  the  applicant  would  be  returned,  not  a
         comparison to the life they would enjoy were they to  remain  here.
         As to cultural barriers, the guidance explains that these might  be
         relevant in situations where the partner would be so  disadvantaged
         that they could not be expected to live in that country.  "It  must
         be a barrier which either cannot be overcome  or  would  present  a
         very high degree of hardship to the partner such that it amounts to
         an insurmountable obstacle."


  13. I was directed to the following judicial guidance. Firstly, in  Izuazu
      (Article 8 - new rules) [2013] UKUT 00045  (IAC)  the  Upper  Tribunal
      explained the need for a two-stage approach.  The  case  predated  the
      Court of Appeal's guidance in  MF  (Nigeria)  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192.
      However, the question of the meaning of insurmountable  obstacles  and
      the use of the phrase by the Strasbourg Court was discussed in  detail
      as follows:


         "54. The  Secretary  of  State  ...  submits  that  "insurmountable
         obstacles" is the test clearly established in the  Strasbourg  case
         law. Mr Nath referred us to Rodrigues  da  Silva  and  Hoogkamer  v
         Netherlands (2006) 4th Section [2006] ECHR at [39]:
                  "The Court reiterates that in the context of both positive
                  and negative obligations the  State  must  strike  a  fair
                  balance between the competing interests of the  individual
                  and of the community as a whole. However, in both contexts
                  the  State  enjoys  a  certain  margin  of   appreciation.
                  Moreover, Article 8 does not entail a general  obligation
                  for a State to respect immigrants' choice of  the  country
                  of their residence and to authorise family reunion in  its
                  territory. Nevertheless, in a case which  concerns  family
                  life as well as  immigration,  the  extent  of  a  State's
                  obligations to admit to its territory relatives of persons
                  residing there  will  vary  according  to  the  particular
                  circumstances of the  persons  involved  and  the  general
                  interest (see G�l v. Switzerland, judgment of 19  February
                  1996, Reports 1996-I, pp. 174-75, � 38).  Factors  to  be
                  taken into account in this context are the extent to which
                  family life is effectively ruptured,  the  extent  of  the
                  ties  in  the  Contracting  State,   whether   there   are
                  insurmountable obstacles in the way of the  family  living
                  in the country of origin of one or more of  them,  whether
                  there are factors of immigration control (e.g.  a  history
                  of breaches  of  immigration  law)  or  considerations  of
                  public order weighing in favour of exclusion (see  Solomon
                  v. the  Netherlands  (dec.),  no.  44328/98,  5 September
                  2000).  Another  important  consideration  will  also   be
                  whether family life was created at a time when the persons
                  involved were aware that the immigration status of one  of
                  them was such that the persistence  of  that  family  life
                  within the host state would from the outset be precarious.
                  The Court has previously held that where this is the  case
                  it  is  likely  only  to  be  in  the   most   exceptional
                  circumstances that the removal of the non-national  family
                  member will constitute a violation of Article 8  (Mitchell
                  v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.  40447/98,  24  November
                  1998, and Ajayi and Others v. the United  Kingdom  (dec.),
                  no. 27663/95, 22 June 1999)."
         55. Similar statements have been made recently in  Nunez  v  Norway
         [2011] ECHR 1047 at [70] and Antwi v Norway [2012] ECHR 259 at [89]
         to [103]; we understand that the case is to be heard in  the  Grand
         Chamber.


         56. We acknowledge  that  in  a  number  of  Strasbourg  decisions,
         different sections of the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  have
         stressed that where initial entry  has  been  unlawful  or  whether
         family life has  been  established  at  a  time  where  status  was
         precarious, it will  only  be  exceptionally  or  where  there  are
         insurmountable obstacles  to  the  family  life  being  transferred
         abroad that removal will be a violation.  We note  that  there  is,
         therefore, some tension between those cases  where  these  criteria
         are used and some of the decisions of senior courts in  the  United
         Kingdom. However, whereas the Strasbourg Court refers to this being
         one of several factors to consider (and others that  were  decisive
         in Nunez included the best interests of the child) HC 194 imposes a
         test that has to be met for leave  to  be  granted.  This  turns  a
         factor in the case into a minimum requirement to be always met.  We
         do not read the Strasbourg cases as doing this.


         57. Further, where  family  life  was  established  through  lawful
         residence, the Grand Chamber in Boultif v  Switzerland  [2001]  did
         not  refer  to  insurmountable  obstacles  but  posed  a  different
         question in its guidance at [48]:
                  "The Court has only a  limited  number  of  decided  cases
                  where the main obstacle to expulsion  was  that  it  would
                  entail difficulties for the spouses to stay together  and,
                  in particular, for one of them and/or the children to live
                  in the other's country of origin. It is  therefore  called
                  upon to establish guiding principles in order  to  examine
                  whether  the  measure  in  question  was  necessary  in  a
                  democratic society.
                  In assessing the relevant criteria in  such  a  case,  the
                  Court will consider the  nature  and  seriousness  of  the
                  offence committed by the applicant; the  duration  of  the
                  applicant's stay in the country from which he is going  to
                  be  expelled;  the  time  which  has  elapsed  since   the
                  commission of the  offence  and  the  applicant's  conduct
                  during that  period;  the  nationalities  of  the  various
                  persons concerned; the applicant's family situation,  such
                  as the length of the  marriage;  other  factors  revealing
                  whether the couple lead a real and  genuine  family  life;
                  whether the spouse knew about the offence at the time when
                  he or she entered into a family relationship; and  whether
                  there are children in the marriage and, if so, their  age.
                  Not least, the Court will also consider the seriousness of
                  the difficulties which  the  spouse  would  be  likely  to
                  encounter in the applicant's country of  origin,  although
                  the  mere  fact  that  a   person   might   face   certain
                  difficulties in accompanying her or his spouse  cannot  in
                  itself preclude expulsion."
         It is thus the degree of difficulty the couple face rather than the
         'surmountability' of the obstacle that is the focus of judicial
         assessment but again as a factor rather than a test.
         58. It has been repeatedly stated in  national  jurisprudence  laid
         down by the higher courts in the UK that in none of these cases was
         Strasbourg laying down a  test  for  engagement  of  Article  8  as
         opposed to reaching a decision on proportionality in the particular
         case.   The   requirement   for   exceptional   circumstances    or
         insurmountable obstacles has been authoritatively declared to be an
         erroneous one in the Article 8 immigration context by the House  of
         Lords in Huang [2007] UKHL 11 at [20], EB Kosovo [2008] UKHL 41  at
         [8] [12] [18] [20] [21] and by the Court of Appeal  on  innumerable
         occasions including  LM (DRC) [2008] EWCA  Civ  325   at  [11]  and
         [13]; VW (Uganda) [2009] EWCA Civ 5  at [19] and  [24];  JO  Uganda
         [2010] EWCA Civ 10  at [14] to [15] and [23] to [26]."


  14. Mr Symes built his submissions about the lesser test being  applicable
      in cases where the appellant has a good immigration history  on  these
      passages. The reasoning of the Upper Tribunal  received  support  from
      the Court of Appeal in obiter dicta in MF (Nigeria), a case  involving
      deportation:

         "47. Before we come to the decision that was made on the  facts  of
         this  case,  we  need  to  say  something   about   "insurmountable
         obstacles".   It will be recalled that one  of  the  situations  in
         which para 399 applies is  where  the  person  has  a  genuine  and
         subsisting relationship with a partner who is in the UK  and  is  a
         British citizen, settled in the UK or in the UK with refugee  leave
         or humanitarian protection, and the partner satisfies the condition
         stated in para 399(b)(i) and "there are insurmountable obstacles to
         family life with that partner continuing outside the UK".


         48. At para 38 of their determination, the UT said that  they  were
         bound by authority to hold that  the  proper  test  for  article  8
         purposes is "reasonableness".   It is not in dispute that MF has  a
         genuine and subsisting relationship with SB and that  SB  satisfies
         the condition stated in para 399(b)(i).  As already noted,  it  was
         conceded on behalf of the Secretary of State before the UT that  it
         would not be "a reasonable option" for SB and  F  to  be  relocated
         with MF to Nigeria and that there were  "insurmountable  obstacles"
         to family life with SB and F continuing outside the UK.

         49. In view of the concession made before the UT, the  question  of
         the meaning of "insurmountable obstacles" does not arise.  We  did,
         however, hear argument on the point.  We  would  observe  that,  if
         "insurmountable" obstacles are  literally  obstacles  which  it  is
         impossible to surmount, their scope is  very  limited  indeed.   We
         shall confine ourselves to saying that we incline to the view that,
         for the reasons stated in detail by the UT in Izuazu at paras 53 to
         59, such a stringent approach would be contrary to article 8."


  15. Finally, succinct guidance is to be found in Gulshan. In paragraph 24,
      the Upper Tribunal drew out some principles  from  the  existing  case
      law, including as follows:


         "(c) the term "insurmountable  obstacles"  in  provisions  such  as
         Section EX.1 are not obstacles which are impossible to surmount: MF
         (Nigeria); they concern the practical possibilities of  relocation.
         In the absence of such insurmountable obstacles, if removal  is  to
         be disproportionate it is necessary to show other non-standard  and
         particular   features   demonstrating   that   removal   will    be
         unjustifiably harsh: Nagre."


  16.  After reviewing the authorities, at paragraph 14, Judge Callow  asked
      himself whether the appellant had  succeeded  in  showing  there  were
      insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing in the  Philippines
      and he focused attention on the sponsor's ill-health. He said this:


         "He is undoubtedly in a subsisting relationship with the  appellant
         wherein they wish to live together permanently with one another. As
         he was born and bred in the UK and is in  close  contact  with  his
         three  adult  children  (and   grandchildren)   it   is   perfectly
         understandable that the sponsor would wish to continue to  live  in
         his home country with the appellant by  his  side.  Notwithstanding
         this, it has not been shown that his propensity  to  heart  attacks
         amounts to an obstacle impossible to surmount.  For  her  part  the
         appellant has accepted that there are suitable  medical  facilities
         and treatment in the Philippines." (emphasis added)


  17. At the heart of this reasoning is the imposition of a test of  whether
      the obstacles are impossible to surmount. Given the  care  with  which
      the judge has set out the available guidance, including a reference to
      this very point from Gulshan in the preceding paragraph, I have  asked
      myself whether the judge  is  simply  paraphrasing  the  rule  without
      straying into error by applying too high a threshold. However, nowhere
      in paragraph 14 is there any indication that the judge has  applied  a
      lower threshold than one of impossibility. I have therefore  concluded
      that, despite the judge's thorough  consideration  of  the  issue,  he
      erred in the manner complained of in the first of Mr Symes's  grounds.
      The error is plainly material because it cannot be excluded  that  the
      judge might have reached  another  view  if  he  had  applied  a  less
      demanding test to the facts. His decision must be set aside.


  18. I decided to remake the decision myself. I heard brief  oral  evidence
      from the appellant. She adopted her witness statements. In the  latest
      one she goes into detail about the sponsor's health situation and  the
      unaffordability of treatment and accommodation in the Philippines,  as
      well as the environmental factors in the  Philippines  which  make  it
      unsuitable for the sponsor. Cross-examined, she explained she has  two
      younger half-siblings. One is soon to  be  married.  The  other  is  a
      student. She contacts them but not  frequently.  Sometimes  she  sends
      them money. It would not be possible to live  with  them  permanently.
      She has no home of her own in the Philippines. She also described  the
      anxiety disorder affecting the sponsor's daughter, Jessica.  His  son,
      Benjamin, has MS.


  19. It is for the appellant to establish matters  of  fact  on  the  civil
      standard of a balance of  probabilities.  As  this  is  an  in-country
      appeal I may consider evidence about any matter which I think relevant
      to the substance of the decision, including evidence which concerns  a
      matter arising after the date of decision. No challenge  was  made  to
      the credibility of the  evidence.  I  found  the  appellant  to  be  a
      straightforward and reliable witness and I  accept  the  evidence  she
      gave as true. Her evidence has been  supported  in  large  measure  by
      documents from independent sources.

  20. There is no reason to disturb the  findings  of  fact  made  by  Judge
      Callow in paragraphs 4 and 7 of his determination. In those paragraphs
      he records the background facts and the up to date situation as at the
      date of hearing before him, which was 16 January 2014.


  21. In assessing the key issue of whether  insurmountable  obstacles  have
      been shown so as to bring the appellant within  paragraph  EX.1(b),  I
      would add the following:
         (1) The appellant has  always  resided  in  the  UK  lawfully.  She
         arrived on 29 January 2009 for the purpose of  studies,  which  she
         has pursued. Having made an application for  further  leave  before
         the expiry of her last grant of leave, she currently has  statutory
         leave. There is no reason to believe  she  has  ever  breached  the
         terms of her leave. She has never breached the law. She works in  a
         care home.


         (2)  There has never been any  challenge  to  the  genuineness  and
         subsistence of her relationship with the sponsor. The couple met in
         2011 and married on 26 July 2012. They have  lived  together  since
         their marriage, which is now a period approaching two years.


         (3)  The sponsor is a British citizen. He has lived here his  whole
         life and all his relatives are here.  His  first  marriage  to  the
         mother of  his  children  broke  up  in  2006.  His  children  are:
         Benjamin, born on 21 April 1987, Christopher, born on  10  February
         1991, and Jessica, born on 7 June 1994. They all live  in  the  UK.
         The sponsor's children have accepted the appellant into the  family
         and speak highly of the strength of the  relationship  between  the
         appellant  and  their  father.  Their  statements  express  serious
         concern about the prospect of the appellant not being permitted  to
         remain in the UK. For a  time  after  the  break-up  of  his  first
         marriage, the sponsor describes himself as "hitting  rock  bottom".
         For a while he was homeless and was eventually  accommodated  in  a
         hostel alongside drug and alcohol users.


         (4)  The appellant had a difficult life  in  the  Philippines.  Her
         mother and step-father died in an accident when  she  was  19.  She
         separated from her half-siblings at that time as they went to  live
         with relatives of their father. In her statements she  talks  about
         the joy and stability which marriage to the sponsor has brought  to
         her life.


         (5)  The sponsor's health is deteriorating. He is no longer able to
         work as a driver and he receives ESA. His family doctor, Dr  Sinha,
         wrote on 17 December 2013 that the sponsor  had  angioplasty  after
         his heart attack on 17 July 2013. He needs  regular  check-ups  and
         medication. He also takes anti-depressants. Dr  Sinha  provided  an
         updated letter on 30 May 2014 explaining that the  sponsor  is  now
         very weak and he cannot manage by himself. He strongly supports the
         appellant's  application.  A  report  by  Dr  Zemmouri   from   the
         Department of Neurology at West Middlesex University, dated 8 April
         2014, states that the appellant has experienced numbness  and  loss
         of feeling on one side of his body and his wife reported periods of
         confusion. Investigations were in hand to pursue the possibility of
         partial  complex  seizures.  The   appellant's   recent   statement
         describes the sponsor's conditions. In April she found him  with  a
         handful of tablets, saying he could not longer take the  stress  of
         their situation. An urgent  referral  was  made  to  mental  health
         services. His medication has been changed and he has been  referred
         for counselling.


         (6)  The sponsor's children have medical  problems  of  their  own.
         Jessica has anxiety disorder and the appellant described how even a
         trip to the dentist becomes difficult due to her fears. She is  not
         able, for example, to travel on buses due to anxiety. Benjamin  has
         psychological problems believed to stem from witnessing the  break-
         up of his parents' marriage. He was recently diagnosed with MS.


         (7)  The appellant accepts there are  good  doctors  and  treatment
         available for the sponsor's conditions in the Philippines. However,
         she has undertaken research into the cost and found that  the  cost
         of the sponsor's current medication would account for around 60% of
         an average person's monthly  salary  in  the  Philippines.  If  the
         sponsor required hospital treatment or another  cardiac  procedure,
         the costs would be prohibitive. Having no home, the appellant would
         have to rent accommodation. The cost of this in addition to day  to
         day expenses would mean they could not afford the appellant's basic
         treatment.


         (8)  There are other practical concerns regarding the  prospect  of
         the sponsor relocating with the appellant to the Philippines,  such
         as the heat and pollution.


  22. I announced at the  hearing  my  decision  to  substitute  a  decision
      allowing the appeal. My reasons are as follows.


  23. I have set out above  the  test  of  insurmountable  obstacles.  I  am
      satisfied that, if the appellant  returned  to  the  Philippines,  the
      sponsor would not be able to countenance  accompanying  her  with  the
      consequence that the family life they  now  enjoy  together  would  be
      destroyed. The particular circumstances of the sponsor  mean  that  he
      cannot and cannot be expected to live in the Philippines.  He is  only
      55 years of age  but  his  health  is  fragile,  both  physically  and
      mentally. He is unable to  work.  He  depends  on  the  treatment  now
      provided by the NHS, as he is entitled to do, for  his  heart  disease
      and depression, on top of which he is  now  experiencing  neurological
      symptoms. His GP describes him as "very  weak".  I  am  satisfied  the
      sponsor could  not  receive  the  treatment  he  requires  to  live  a
      reasonably satisfactory life. He would suffer complete isolation while
      the appellant goes out to work  which  would  inevitably  have  severe
      consequences for his already significant mental  health  difficulties.
      He would lose regular contact with his children,  which  he  obviously
      values enormously. They, in turn, benefit  from  having  their  father
      nearby. In my judgment, the facts  of  this  case  take  it  beyond  a
      situation in which the  couple  could  maintain  family  life  in  the
      Philippines, albeit with  some  hardship.  The  hardship  which  would
      result would make it wholly impractical  and  it  is  unreasonable  to
      expect them to uproot themselves and attempt to start a  new  life  in
      the Philippines.


  24. The appellant meets the requirements of paragraph  EX.1(b)  so  as  to
      benefit from exemption from the other elements of  Appendix  FM  which
      she cannot meet. I therefore allow her appeal under the rules.


  25. It follows that removing the appellant in consequence of the  decision
      would also breach article 8 outside the rules for which  the  test  is
      not whether there are insurmountable obstacles to family life  outside
      the UK but whether it is reasonable to expect the couple to do so.


DECISION

     The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal made a material error on a  point
    of law and his decision dismissing the appellant's appeal is set aside.


    The following decision is substituted:


    The appeal brought under  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules  is
    allowed.


    The appeal is allowed on article 8 grounds.


    No anonymity direction has been made.

    Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

    In the light of my decision to re-make the decision in  the  appeal  by
    allowing it, I have considered whether to make a fee  award  (rule  23A
    (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005
    and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act

    I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance Note:  Fee  Awards
    in Immigration Appeals (December 2011).


    I make a fee award of �140.


    Reasons:      The appeal has been allowed.
