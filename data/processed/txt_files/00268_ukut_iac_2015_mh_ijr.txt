JUDGE COKER: This is the hearing of a judicial review of  a  decision  dated
    14 December 2013 to remove  the  applicant  from  the  UK  pursuant  to
    Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

2.   There was a little concern as to whether  the  applicant  had  received
    notice of today's hearing. It seems from the court  file  that  he  may
    have been sent notice to [Address A], London.  The respondent wrote  to
    him  on  24  April  2015  at  [Address  B],  London  referring  to  the
    substantive hearing of this case today.  Either way, whether he  is  at
    the [Address A] address or  the  [Address  B]  address,  he  will  have
    received notice of today's hearing.

3.   Proceedings were initially  issued  seeking  permission  to  judicially
    review the removal directions dated 19 December  2013.   Those  grounds
    were subsequently amended with consent to  challenge  the  14  December
    2013 decision and not the removal directions which  had  in  any  event
    been cancelled. Permission was granted on 14 May 2014 and comment  made
    that the respondent had not filed an acknowledgement of  service.   The
    Secretary of State had in fact filed the acknowledgement of service but
    this had not reached the judge who granted permission, although it  has
    now come to light.

4.   The grounds are that at the date of the decision the applicant had  not
    been provided with particulars of the evidence justifying  his  removal
    and there had been a failure to exercise discretion whether to  curtail
    leave rather than make a Section 10 removal decision.

5.   The applicant has not filed any further documents despite  a  direction
    that he file a skeleton argument and trial  bundle  at  least  21  days
    prior to the date of hearing. No application to extend  time  has  been
    made and no explanation for the failure to comply with  directions  has
    been given.  The applicant of course is not here today.

6.   As regards ground 1, the applicant has  an  out  of  country  right  of
    appeal. The gist of the reason for  the  decision  to  remove  him  was
    communicated to the applicant. There is no precedent  fact  that  would
    require a decision prior to the decision to remove.  The respondent had
    adequate evidence before her to make the decision, namely an  interview
    with the applicant's employer confirming that  he  was  employed.   The
    appeal structure set out by Parliament enables appeals  to  be  brought
    out of country where there factual matters in dispute: see for example,
    Shabaz Ali [2014] EWHC 3967 (Admin) and Jan [2014] UKUT 00265 (IAC).

7.   As far as ground 2 is concerned, although there  is  a  discretion  not
    only did the respondent exercise that discretion concluding that it was
    proportionate to utilise the  Section  10  process,  but  there  is  no
    requirement for her to specify reasons why she has chosen one procedure
    over another:  see Jan.

   8. For these reasons judicial review of the decision of 14 December  2013
      is refused.


   9. So far as costs are concerned, I  have  received  a  schedule  of  the
      respondent's costs and make an order to that effect, namely  ï¿½6,098.40
      to be paid by the applicant to the respondent.

  10. Although the applicant is not here to request permission to appeal  to
      the Court of Appeal I refuse permission  to  appeal,  there  being  no
      arguable point  of  law  capable  of  affecting  the  outcome  of  the
      application.
