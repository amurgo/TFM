                       NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL OF APPEAL

In a Decision promulgated on 23 April 2015 the  Appellant's  appeal  against
refusal of asylum was dismissed but allowed on humanitarian grounds.

He was given permission to appeal but by letter dated 11 February  2016  the
appellant's solicitors informed the Tribunal  that  he  wishes  to  withdraw
that appeal.

Pursuant to rule 17(2) of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
2008 I give permission to the appellant to withdraw his appeal.

This is a Notice pursuant to rule 17(5) of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008 to the parties that the  appeal  is  withdrawn  at  the
appellant's request and with the permission of the Upper Tribunal.
