                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Fox sitting at Manchester  on  30  September
    2016) dismissing her appeal against the decision of  the  Secretary  of
    State to refuse to grant her leave to remain on human rights grounds on
    account of her marriage to a British citizen.  The First-tier  Tribunal
    did not make an anonymity direction, and I do  not  consider  that  the
    Appellant  requires  anonymity  for  these  proceedings  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Relevant background facts

 2. The Appellant is a national of Jamaica, whose date of birth is  25  May
    1967.  She entered the United Kingdom on 30 June 2001 with valid  entry
    clearance as a visitor until 20 July 2001.

 3. The Appellant did not leave the United Kingdom before the expiry of her
    visa, and she overstayed.  She first sought to  regularise  her  status
    some nine years later, and she applied for leave to remain outside  the
    Rules on 24 May 2010.  The application was refused  with  no  right  of
    appeal on 24 June 2010.

 4. On 26 July 2010, the Appellant was served with an IS151A notice  as  an
    overstayer.  The Appellant submitted a human rights application  on  21
    May 2012, and her application was refused with no right of appeal on  5
    August 2013.  On 28 August 2013 the Appellant asked for the decision to
    be reconsidered, and the application was refused on reconsideration  on
    3 December 2014.

 5. On 14 May 2015, the Appellant applied for leave to remain as the spouse
    of a British citizen.  The Appellant and her Sponsor  were  invited  to
    attend a marriage interview in Sheffield on 21 September 2015.

 6. On 28 September 2015, the Secretary  of  State  gave  her  reasons  for
    refusing her application.   She  was  satisfied  that  the  information
    obtained  at  the  marriage  interview  strongly  indicated  that   the
    relationship between her and the Sponsor was not genuine.  In light  of
    the discrepancies produced at the marriage interview, her marriage  was
    deemed to be a marriage of convenience.

The Hearing before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 7. Both parties were legally represented at the hearing before Judge  Fox.
    The  Appellant's  solicitors  compiled  a  bundle  of  documents  which
    included birth certificates for the Sponsor's children  by  a  previous
    relationship.

 8. On [ ] 2006, IW, a Polish national, had given birth  in  Preston  to  a
    child, [C1], fathered by Lloyd Hemmings, a national of Jamaica.  On [ ]
    2008, IW had given birth to a second child, [C2], by the same father.

 9. In a letter dated 25 August 2016, [C1] said he was writing to say  that
    Novelette Hemmings was his stepmother, whom he loved  very  much.   She
    was the one that took care of him and his  brother.   She  helped  them
    with their schoolwork and she cooked, and she took them  to  activities
    in their community and to visit other places.   She  stayed  with  them
    while their dad worked nights at the hospital.

10. Before the hearing began, Counsel for the Appellant took  supplementary
    witness statements from both the Appellant and  her  husband.   In  her
    supplementary statement, the Appellant said that the role she played in
    her stepchildren's lives was  akin  to  that  of  a  mother.   She  had
    established a strong relationship with them since living with them from
    November 2012.  It would not be possible for them to  live  in  Jamaica
    because their mother, IW, resided in the UK and visited them every  two
    weeks.  Her husband also had another child who  lived  in  Burnley,  as
    well as a fourth child who lived in Jamaica.

11. In his supplementary witness statement,  Mr  Lloyd  Hemmings  confirmed
    that the Appellant had taken on the role of mother to his two children,
    [C1] and [C2], since she had started living with him in November  2012.
    The children's mother saw them every two weeks,  and  she  also  called
    them regularly on the telephone.  She lived in Preston,  as  they  did,
    but  she  had  problems  with  alcohol.   That  was  why  the  children
    permanently resided with her, rather than with their biological mother.

12. In his subsequent decision, the Judge found that the Respondent had not
    discharged  the  burden  of  proving  that  the  marriage  was  one  of
    convenience.  He was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the
    relationship between the Appellant and her husband, Mr Lloyd  Hemmings,
    was genuine and subsisting.

13. He turned to consider her Article 8 ECHR  rights  in  conjunction  with
    Section 55.  He found that family life existed between  the  Appellant,
    the Sponsor and her two stepchildren.

14. However, the Sponsor and his children were able to function effectively
    in her absence.  The Sponsor also had the benefit of family members  to
    whom he could  turn  should  he  require  support  in  the  Appellant's
    temporary absence.  He found that  it  was  reasonable  to  expect  the
    Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  to  accept  the  inconvenience   of   the
    Appellant's return to Jamaica in order  for  her  to  apply  for  entry
    clearance in the appropriate category, applying Chen v  SSHD  (Appendix
    FM - Chikwamba - Temporary separation  -  proportionality)  IJR  [2015]
    UKUT 00189 (IAC).

15. The Sponsor was engaged in  employment  in  which  he  received  annual
    remuneration above the financial threshold required by the  Respondent.
    An application for entry clearance would give the  Sponsor  the  formal
    opportunity to assume financial responsibility  for  the  Appellant  in
    accordance with the Rules.  It was reasonable to expect the Sponsor  to
    make alternative childcare arrangements to facilitate  the  Appellant's
    requirement to respect immigration control.

16. The Sponsor was not entitled to prioritise his personal interests  over
    the needs of  the  wider  society  to  maintain  effective  immigration
    control.  There was no reliable evidence to demonstrate  any  detriment
    to the children's best  interests.   There  was  no  dispute  that  the
    children were not required to leave the UK.  The  Sponsor  remained  an
    effective parent to safeguard their interests  during  the  Appellant's
    temporary absence.  There would be  no  disruption  to  the  children's
    education.  Any minor disruption to their environment could be  managed
    effectively through responsible parental decisions.





The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

17. On 13 February 2017, the First-tier Tribunal Judge MJ Gillespie granted
    permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         "The proposed grounds of onward  appeal  raise  a  fairly  arguable
         point as to material error of law.  The learned First-tier Tribunal
         Judge has failed to consider whether two minor children said to  be
         affected by the decision are one or other  or  both  "a  qualifying
         child" for  the  purposes  of  Section  117D  of  the  Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002; whether there exists  between  the
         appellant and these children a  "genuine  and  subsisting  parental
         relationship" for the purposes of Section 117B(6); and  whether  it
         would be reasonable under this enactment to expect either  or  both
         of these children to leave  the  United  Kingdom.   The  Judge  has
         accordingly arguably failed to consider whether, for  the  purposes
         of Section 117B(6), there is any public interest in the removal  of
         the appellant."

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

18. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, I indicated at the outset that I was minded to find  an  error  of
    law for the reasons given in the grant of permission.

19. After hearing from Mr Melvin, who drew my attention to  SF  and  Others
    (Guidance, post-2014 Act) Albania [2017] UKUT 00020 (IAC), I ruled that
    an error of law was made out.  I give my  reasons  for  so  finding  in
    short form, and I expand on these reasons in my  error  of  law  ruling
    below.

20. I informed the parties that I proposed to proceed  immediately  to  the
    remaking of the decision.  Both the Appellant and her partner  were  in
    attendance, and I asked Mr Melvin whether he wished to question  either
    of them on the topic  of  whether  the  Appellant  had  a  genuine  and
    subsisting  parental  relationship  with  her  two  stepchildren.    He
    declined to do so.

21. Mr Klear drew my attention to R (on  the  application  of  RK)  v  SSHD
    (s.117B(6); parental relationship)  IJR  [2016]  UKUT  0031  where  the
    Tribunal held as follows:

         "1.  It is not  necessary  for  an  individual  to  have  "parental
             responsibility"  in  law  for  there  to  exist   a   parental
             relationship.

         2.   Whether a person who is  not  a  biological  parent  is  in  a
             "parental relationship" with  a  child  for  the  purposes  of
             s.117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002
             depends on the individual circumstances and whether  the  role
             that individual plays establishes he or she has "stepped  into
             the shoes" of a parent.

         3.   Applying that approach, apart  from  the  situation  of  split
             families where relationships between parents have broken  down
             and an actual or de  facto  step-parent  exists,  it  will  be
             unusual, but not impossible, for more than two individuals  to
             have a "parental relationship"  with  a  child.  However,  the
             relationships between a child and  professional  or  voluntary
             carers or family friends are not "parental relationships"."




Reasons for finding an error of law

22. The Judge erred in law in not expressly engaging with Section  117B(6).
    For if the Appellant could successfully claim to  have  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship  with  her  stepchildren,  this  might
    relieve her of the requirement of returning to Jamaica  to  seek  entry
    clearance.

23. The interrelationship between the Chikwamba line  of  authority,  which
    includes Chen, and  the  operation  of  Section  117B(6)  is  far  from
    straightforward.  But on the facts found in the Appellant's  favour  by
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge, Section 117B(6) was clearly in play, and
    the judge needed  to  explain  why  this  section  did  not  avail  the
    Appellant in the proportionality assessment outside the Rules.

Discussion and findings on remaking

24. I adopt the findings of fact made by the  First-tier  Tribunal,  and  I
    make two further findings of fact as follows:

          a) The Appellant's stepchildren are qualifying children  as  they
             are both British citizens; and

          b)  The  Appellant  is  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
             relationship with these two qualifying children.

25. Accordingly, the Appellant can potentially take the benefit of  Section
    117B(6), provided that it is not reasonable to expect the  children  to
    leave the UK.  I observe that the same question arises under EX.1(a).

26. In the Refusal decision, the Respondent did not address either  EX.1(a)
    or EX.1(b) as she did not accept that the Appellant was  in  a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship with Mr Hemmings.  But as  this  issue  has
    been resolved in the Appellant's favour, paragraph EX.1(a) is  engaged.



27. In deciding whether the Appellant qualifies for leave to  remain  under
    the Rules by the route of EX.1(a), or on an exceptional  basis  outside
    the Rules by the route of Section 117B(6), it is necessary to  consider
    the relevant jurisprudence and the relevant policy guidance.
The Home Office Policy Guidance
28. The IDIs on Family Migration: Appendix FM dated August  2015  state  at
    paragraph 11.2.4 that  the  longer  a  non-British  citizen  child  has
    resided in the UK, the more the balance swings in favour  of  it  being
    unreasonable to expect the child to leave the UK,, and  strong  reasons
    are required to refuse a case where the child has  accrued  over  seven
    years continuous residence.

29. The same IDIs contain at paragraph 11.2.3  guidance  on  answering  the
    following question: "Would it  be  unreasonable  to  expect  a  British
    citizen child to leave the UK?"  The guidance provides, inter alia,  as
    follows:

       Save in cases involving criminality,  the  decision-maker  must  not
       take a decision in relation to the parent  or  primary  carer  of  a
       British citizen child where the effect of that decision would be  to
       force that British citizen to leave the EU, regardless of the age of
       that child.  This reflects the European Court of Justice Judgment in
       Zambrano ...

       Where a decision to refuse the application would require a parent or
       primary carer to return to a country outside the EU, the  case  must
       always be assessed on the basis that it  would  be  unreasonable  to
       expect a British citizen child to leave the EU with that  parent  or
       primary carer.

       In such cases it will usually be appropriate to grant leave  to  the
       parent or primary carer, to enable them to remain in the UK with the
       child, provided that there is satisfactory evidence of a genuine and
       subsisting parental relationship.

       It may, however, be appropriate to refuse to grant leave  where  the
       conduct of the parent or primary carer gives rise to  considerations
       of such weight as to justify separation, if a child could  otherwise
       stay with another parent or alternative primary carer in the  UK  or
       in the EU.

The question of reasonableness

30. In MA (Pakistan) and Others, R (on the application of) v Upper Tribunal
    (IAC) & Anor [2016] EWCA Civ 705 at paragraph [45] Elias LJ said:

         In my judgment, the court should have regard to the conduct of  the
         applicant and any other matters relevant  to  the  public  interest
         when applying the 'unduly harsh' concept under Section 117C(5),  so
         should it when considering the  question  of  reasonableness  under
         Section 117B(6).  ...  The critical point is that  Section  117C(5)
         is in substance a  free-standing  provision  in  the  same  way  as
         Section 117B(6), and even so the court in  MM  (Uganda)  held  that
         wider public interest considerations must  be  taken  into  account
         when applying the 'unduly harsh' criterion.  It seems to me that it
         must be equally so with respect to the reasonableness criterion  in
         Section 117B(6).  It would not be appropriate to  distinguish  that
         decision simply because I have reservations whether it is  correct.
         Accordingly, in line with the approach in that case, I will analyse
         the appeals on the basis that the Secretary of  State's  submission
         on this point is correct and that the only significance of  Section
         117B(6) is that where the seven year Rule is  satisfied,  it  is  a
         factor of some weight leaning in favour of leave  to  remain  being
         granted.

31. At paragraph [46] Elias LJ said that the published Home  Office  Policy
    guidance merely confirmed what is implicit in adopting  a  policy  [the
    seven year rule] of this nature:

         After such a period of time the child will have put down roots  and
         developed social, cultural and educational links  in  the  UK  such
         that it is likely to be highly disruptive if the child is  required
         to leave the UK. That may be less when the children are very  young
         because the focus of their lives will be on their families, but the
         disruption becomes more serious as they  get  older.  Moreover,  in
         these cases there must  be  a  very  strong  expectation  that  the
         child's best interests will to be remain in the UK with his parents
         as part of  a  family  unit,  and  that  must  rank  as  a  primary
         consideration in the proportionality assessment.

32. At paragraph [48] Elias LJ cited with approval the explanation given by
    Clarke LJ in EV (Phillipines) at  [34]-[37]  as  to  how  the  Tribunal
    should apply the  proportionality  test  where  wider  public  interest
    considerations are in play, in circumstances where the  best  interests
    of the child dictate that he should remain with his  parents.  At  [36]
    Clarke LJ said that  if  it  is  overwhelmingly  in  the  child's  best
    interests to remain, the need to maintain immigration control may  well
    not tip the balance. By contrast if it is in the child's best interests
    to remain, but only on balance (with some factors  pointing  the  other
    way), the result may be the opposite. Clarke LJ continued in [37]:

         In the balance on the other side  there  falls  to  be  taken  into
         account the strong weight to be  given  to  the  need  to  maintain
         immigration control in pursuit of the economic  well-being  of  the
         country and the fact that, ex hypothesi,  the  applicants  have  no
         entitlement to remain. The immigration history of the  parents  may
         also be relevant e.g.  if  they  are  overstayers,  or  have  acted
         deceitfully.

33. Having regard to the relevant jurisprudence  and  the  relevant  policy
    guidance, it is clearly in the children's best interests to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom.  Not only are they both British citizens, they have
    also accrued over seven years residence in the UK since birth.

34. Long residence coupled with British citizenship gives rise  to  a  very
    strong private life claim for each child.  There would be some benefits
    in the children going to Jamaica, but these benefits  are  considerably
    outweighed by the best interest considerations militating in favour  of
    them remaining here.

35. Although they would be able to return to the UK once they  reach  their
    respective ages of majority, they  would  be  deprived  of  the  active
    enjoyment of the benefits of British citizenship for the  remainder  of
    their formative  years.   They  have  developed  social,  cultural  and
    educational ties in this country that  it  would  be  inappropriate  to
    disrupt. It will be very much in their  best  interests  to  have  both
    stability and continuity of social and educational provision,  and  the
    benefit of growing up in the cultural norms of  the  society  to  which
    they belong. The effect of enforced relocation will be to  deprive  the
    children of regular contact with their biological mother, who cannot be
    expected to follow them to Jamaica.

36. In deciding the question of reasonableness, it  is  necessary  to  have
    regard  to  wider  proportionality  considerations,   including   those
    identified in Sections 117B(1) to (5) of the 2002 Act.

37. It is in the Appellant's favour that she can  speak  English,  as  this
    means that she is better able to integrate into UK society.  It is also
    in the Appellant's favour that  her  sponsor  is  earning  �19,000  per
    annum, as this means he can produce the specified evidence to show that
    he has a specified gross annual income of at least �18,600 per annum to
    support her (as Judge Fox found).

38. A factor weighing against her is that generally little weight should be
    attached to private and family life which is built up by a person while
    that person's status here is unlawful. On the other  hand,  it  is  not
    suggested in the Refusal letter that her conduct has been so bad as  to
    bar her from relief on suitability grounds.  It is also  not  suggested
    that the Appellant has a "very poor" immigration  history  as  distinct
    from a merely poor one: that is to say, being  an  overstayer,  working
    without permission, not seeking  to  regularise  her  status  for  many
    years, and ignoring meritorious refusal decisions  which,  if  complied
    with, would have meant that she would not have had the  opportunity  to
    develop the family ties in the UK upon which she now relies.

39.  It  is  not  suggested  that  the  Appellant   has   "repeatedly   and
    deliberately" breached the Immigration Rules, or otherwise has  a  very
    poor immigration history.  So the Appellant does not  come  within  the
    circumstances envisaged in the IDIs where  it  may  be  appropriate  to
    refuse to grant leave: namely, where  the  conduct  of  the  parent  or
    primary carer gives rise to considerations of such weight as to justify
    separation from qualifying children.

40. In short, the public interest considerations which weigh in  favour  of
    requiring the Appellant to leave the UK are not of sufficient weight to
    justify separating the Appellant from her stepchildren  or  to  justify
    the stepchildren being forced to leave the UK with their stepmother and
    father.

41. Also, the Respondent has not advanced strong reasons for expecting  the
    children to leave the UK with their  father  and  stepmother.   On  the
    contrary, the Respondent's starting point is that the children are  not
    expected to leave the UK.

42. Accordingly, having regard to the fact that it is  fairly  emphatically
    in the children's best interests to remain in the UK,  and  it  is  not
    reasonable to expect the children to leave the  UK,  I  find  that  the
    Appellant qualifies for a grant of leave to  remain  under  EX.1(a)  of
    Appendix FM. It is not  therefore  necessary  to  look  at  the  matter
    outside the Rules. But if it were, the same result would follow.

43. Judge  Fox  gives  cogent  reasons  as  to  why  the  relatively  minor
    inconvenience and disruption consequential upon a temporary  separation
    should not prevail over the public interest in requiring  an  irregular
    migrant, such as the Appellant, to return to her country of  origin  to
    regularise her status. However, if a  person  meets  all  the  relevant
    requirements of EX.1(a), and hence all  the  relevant  requirements  of
    Section 117B(6), then that person is relieved  of  the  requirement  of
    regularising his or her immigration status by returning to his  or  her
    country of origin to make an application for entry clearance.

44. Accordingly, the Appellant succeeds  in  her  appeal  on  human  rights
    grounds under Article 8 ECHR because the decision to refuse  her  leave
    to remain does not strike a fair balance between, on the one hand,  her
    rights and those of her two qualifying stepchildren, and, on the  other
    hand, the wider interests of society. It is not  proportionate  to  the
    legitimate public end sought to be achieved, namely the maintenance  of
    firm and effective immigration  controls  and  the  protection  of  the
    country's economic well-being.

Notice of Decision

45. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of law,  and
    accordingly the decision is set aside and  the  following  decision  is
    substituted:  the  Appellant's  appeal  is  allowed  under  EX.1(a)  of
    Appendix FM and also outside the Rules on human right grounds  (Article
    8 ECHR).

Anonymity direction not made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed this appeal, I have given consideration as to  whether  to
make a fee award in respect of any fee which has been paid  or  is  payable,
and I have decided to make no fee award as the  Appellant  needed  to  bring
forward further evidence in order to succeed in her appeal.
