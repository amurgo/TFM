The Upper Tribunal
(Immigration and Asylum Chamber)  Appeal number: IA/16550/2013

                            THE IMMIGRATION ACTS

                                   Before

                       UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE KOPIECZEK


                                   Between

                                SAMBA GUISSE
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                                  DECISION


   1. The appellant has an appeal outstanding before the Upper Tribunal.  By
      letter dated 14 March 2014 his legal representatives  state  that  the
      appellant wishes to withdraw the appeal.

   2. Rule 17 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 provides
      that a party may give notice of the withdrawal of its case or any part
      of it, subject to the consent of  the  Upper  Tribunal.  There  is  no
      provision for  a  party  to  withdraw  the  appeal  before  the  Upper
      Tribunal. Therefore, the letter from the  appellant's  representatives
      can serve only as a notice of withdrawal of his case before the  Upper
      Tribunal, to which the Upper Tribunal now consents.

   3. The effect of the withdrawal of  the  appellant's  case  is  that  the
      decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal stands.  The
      appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
