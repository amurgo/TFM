                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  M
    A Khan promulgated on 25 October 2018 in which he dismissed the  appeal
    of the Appellant on human rights grounds  against  a  decision  of  the
    Respondent dated 26 September 2017 refusing  leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom for the purpose of continued contact with his daughter.


2.   I make an anonymity order in these  proceedings  because  they  involve
    and impact upon a minor who has been the subject of proceedings  before
    the Family Courts in the United Kingdom.


3.   The Appellant's personal details and immigration history are  a  matter
    of record on file I do not make reference to his  personal  details  in
    keeping with the anonymity order, and only  refer  to  his  immigration
    history insofar as it is relevant for the present purposes.


4.   The Appellant is the father of P a British citizen  child  born  on  24
    May 2013.  He does not live  with  P  or  P's  mother.   The  Appellant
    applied for a 'Child Arrangements Order' pursuant to section 8  of  the
    Children Act 1989 in the Central Family Court. An Order was made by the
    court on 14 April 2016 (copy on file).  It may be seen on the  face  of
    the Order that there was  involvement  of  a  CAFCASS  officer  in  the
    proceedings, and that the Order  directed  that  the  Appellant  should
    spend time with P in accordance with the particulars of the Order which
    provided for weekly direct contact.


5.   The Appellant was last granted leave to remain  from  7  November  2014
    until  7  November  2016.   This   grant   of   leave   was   following
    reconsideration by the Respondent of  a  refused  application,  and  is
    stated on the papers to have been a grant of leave outside the rules  -
    "LOTR". I have not been able to identify on  file  any  documents  that
    authoritatively indicates the exact basis of this  application  or  the
    grant of leave to remain. The Appellant has  asserted  in  his  witness
    statement dated 11 December 2017 that he was granted leave on the basis
    of his parental relationship with his daughter (paragraph 6 of  witness
    statement). This assertion does not appear to have been disputed by the
    Respondent before the First-tier Tribunal.


6.   The Appellant applied  for  further  leave  to  remain  by  way  of  an
    application form signed on 14 October 2016 sent under cover of a letter
    dated 17 October 2016.  Essentially he applied on  the  basis  that  he
    wished to continue to enjoy his relationship with his daughter pursuant
    to the contact order that he had obtained.


7.   The Appellant's application was  refused  for  reasons  set  out  in  a
    'reasons for refusal' letter ('RFRL') dated  26  September  2017.   The
    Respondent considered the application in the first instance pursuant to
    the 'parent route' under Appendix FM.  The Respondent decided that  the
    Appellant failed on 'suitability' grounds  because  he  had  failed  to
    provide without reasonable excuse specific information requested by the
    Respondent in the course of the application.


8.   The Respondent also decided that the Appellant's application failed  on
    'eligibility' grounds because he had not satisfied  the  decision-maker
    that he was exercising direct contact with his daughter - "... you have
    not produced evidence that you have direct access  in  person  and  are
    maintaining contact with your child.... [I]t is not accepted  that  you
    have evidenced you  have  direct  access  in  person  to  your  child".
    Necessarily, this assessment by the Respondent was  consequential  upon
    the  Respondent  determining  that  the  nature   of   the   supporting
    documentary material provided by the Appellant was not satisfactory. It
    was acknowledged that the  Appellant  had  provided  "a  child  contact
    order", but this was not considered to be sufficient in itself to  meet
    the requirements of the  Rules.  The  key  passage  in  the  RFRL  that
    encompasses both these points is in these terms:

         "We have reached this decision because your court order only states
         the stipulations around your agreed contact. It does  not  actually
         prove that you have contact between  yourself  and  your  daughter.
         After being prompted to provide evidence  on  formal  headed  paper
         that you are involved in your daughter's life you did  not  provide
         us with any information. It is stated in the court order  that  you
         were to be added to your daughter's emergency  contact  details  at
         her nursery as you may be required to pick her up so  there  is  no
         reason why you would be unable to provide this information  to  us.
         Although you state that you have contact and that  you  financially
         support your child you have  not  provided  any  contact  and  this
         financial support can continue from outside the UK."


9.   I pause to note that the Appellant was "prompted to  provide  evidence"
    by way of correspondence from the Respondent that has  been  reproduced
    in  the  Appellant's  bundle  before  the  First-tier   Tribunal.   The
    Respondent wrote to the Appellant's representatives on  2  August  2017
    stating, in part:

         "If your client does not reside with his child then please  provide
         documentary evidence to confirm that your client has  contact  with
         his child. This should include your child's full details  including
         name and address, be dated within the last 3 months and  should  be
         unofficial headed paper and be  from  your  clients  child  school,
         nursery, health visitor, GP or Local Authority. The  letter  should
         confirm what contact  your  client  has  with  his  child,  example
         weather has attended appointments with them whether your client  is
         listed as one of their emergency contacts."


10.  The Appellant's representatives made a response  by  recorded  delivery
    sent on 7 August 2017 enclosing: bank statements  which  were  said  to
    show regular financial support to the  Appellant's  daughter's  mother;
    the Family Court Order of 14 April 2016; photographs of  the  Appellant
    and his daughter; and a booklet including photographs  of  a  visit  to
    Chessington  World  of  Adventures  in  May  2017.  The  correspondence
    reproduced  in   the   Appellant's   bundle   reveals   a   degree   of
    misunderstanding  and/or  miscommunication  between   the   Appellant's
    representatives and the Respondent: however,  ultimately  it  is  clear
    enough that the Respondent asserted  that  the  material  submitted  on
    behalf of the Appellant was not considered adequate  to  establish  the
    claimed relationship between the Appellant and P, and  the  Appellant's
    representatives disputed this position - see Respondent  second  letter
    of 22 August 2017, and the representatives email of 23 August 2017.


11.  The Appellant's application was also refused on  private  life  grounds
    under paragraph 276 ADE (1) of the Rules.


12.  The Appellant appealed to the IAC.


13.  The appeal was dismissed for reasons set out in the decision of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Khan.


14.  The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    which was granted on 14 November  2018  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Lever.


15.  In light of the helpful discussion that took place during  the  hearing
    this morning Mr Bramble in due course indicated that he did not seek to
    make any further submissions by way of resisting the  challenge  raised
    on behalf of the Appellant. In all such circumstances I set  aside  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal for inadequacy of reasons amounting
    to a material error of law.


16.  In this context I note in particular the following matters.

         (i) At paragraph 18 of the Decision  the  Judge  characterised  the
         Appellant's evidence as  being  vague  and  evasive:  "I  find  the
         Appellant's evidence with regard to the continuous contact with his
         daughter as vague and evasive".  However  it  is  not  possible  to
         discern within the Decision  what  it  was  about  the  Appellant's
         evidence that might be said to be either vague or evasive.  In  the
         circumstances  the  Judge  has   not   adequately   explained   his
         characterisation of the Appellant's evidence.

         (ii) The Judge identified that the Appellant had produced a  number
         of photographs of himself with his daughter  including  photographs
         taken at Chessington World of Adventure in May 2017, together  with
         other photographs dating from 2016 and 2017 - albeit that  most  of
         the photographs produced by the Appellant were taken in  2018  (see
         paragraphs 20 and 24).  In my judgement the acknowledgement of  the
         existence of these photographs is not readily reconcilable with the
         Judge's conclusion that the Appellant  had  not  maintained  direct
         contact with his daughter between the  date  of  the  Family  Court
         order in April 2016 and - on the Judge's findings -  about  October
         2017 (see paragraph 22). The photographs were  significant  because
         they appeared to support the claim of  contact  continuing  through
         2016 and 2017; in suh circumstances they could not,  without  more,
         be in effect substantively marginalised by the Judge's comment that
         "these photographs do not take the matter  a  great  deal  further"
         (paragraph 24).

         (iii)  At  paragraph  23  of  the  Decision  the  Judge  noted  the
         Appellant's bank statements and his evidence with regard to  making
         regular financial payments by way of maintenance.  The Judge  notes
         two significant payments in August 2015 and December 2015, and then
         states: "There are regular payments into the  account  until  about
         June 2016.  Thereafter they fade away to very small sums".   It  is
         not  readily  discernible  from  the  bank  statements   that   the
         maintenance payments did indeed fade away to very small sums.   The
         bank statements seem to demonstrate that there were regular monthly
         payments continuing well after June 2016, usually going out of  the
         Appellant's account by way of a  mobile  phone  transaction  on  or
         about the 15th or 16th of the month.  The sum  is  usually  of  the
         order of �100 or �120.   It  is  difficult  to  see  that  this  is
         significantly different from the pattern  of  maintenance  payments
         prior to June 2016.  It is not readily discernible on what reasoned
         basis the Judge concluded that the sums had 'faded away'.

         (iv) Moreover it is to be noted that  the  Judge  appears  to  have
         accepted  that  the  Appellant  was  exercising  contact  with  his
         daughter at least from October 2017.  This was in the context of  a
         hearing taking place approximately a year later  in  October  2018.
         In such circumstances one  would  have  expected  to  see  a  clear
         evaluation of the  best  interests  of  the  Appellant's  daughter,
         notwithstanding the Judge's conclusion at paragraph  25  that  "the
         child in this case is being used as  means  for  the  Appellant  to
         remain in the UK".  It seems to me that even if there  had  been  a
         suggestion of a cynical motivation on the part of the Appellant  it
         would still be incumbent upon  a  decision-maker  to  consider  the
         matter from the perspective of the child who might, or  might  not,
         be aware of the motivation of her  father  in  maintaining  contact
         with her.  Whilst of course it might have been open for a decision-
         maker to conclude that if the Appellant were successful in securing
         leave he would then cease his contact with his daughter, the  Judge
         makes no such finding. There  is  no  express  reference  to  'best
         interests' at any point in the decision.


17.  In the circumstances the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  is
    set aside.


18.  The decision in the appeal will require  to  be  remade  after  careful
    consideration of all available evidence including any further  evidence
    that the Appellant might now wish to seek  to  file  -  to  demonstrate
    continuing involvement with his daughter, and/or to attempt to meet any
    concerns that might relate to possible cynical motivation on his  part,
    and/or to provide any further  evidence  that  might  be  available  in
    relation to the period that had attracted the concern of the First-tier
    Tribunal Judge. However, the exact nature of any further evidence  that
    the Appellant may wish to file is ultimately a matter for him  (perhaps
    with the guidance of his advisors); the former is not intended to stand
    as specific Directions, or  otherwise  to  be  either  prescriptive  or
    proscriptive.


Notice of Decision

19.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
    law and is set aside.


20.  The decision in the appeal  is  to  be  remade  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal by any Judge other than First-tier Tribunal M A Khan, with all
    issues at large.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
