                        UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE MACLEMAN

                                   Between

                               SWRKEW MUHAMMED
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Maguire,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                                DETERMINATION

 1. In her decision dated 5 February 2016 the respondent accepted that  the
    appellant is a Kurd from Kirkuk who fled from ISIS, but  not  that  his
    father was a Ba'athist, and held that the appellant could  relocate  to
    the IKR.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge McGrade dismissed the appellant's  appeal  by
    decision promulgated on 20 December 2016.  He rejected the account that
    the appellant's father was a  Ba'athist,  considered  it  open  to  the
    appellant to relocate to Kurdistan,  and  rejected  the  asylum  appeal
    (�29).  He rejected also submissions based on humanitarian  protection,
    on article 3 and on private life (�30 -32).

 3. The first ground of appeal to the UT was inadequate assessment  of  the
    feasibility of relocation, in respect of lack of documentation.

 4. The second ground was error in failing to assess  the  significance  of
    the absence of evidence that the Kurdish  authorities  had  pre-cleared
    the appellant for entry, which also made it material that there was  no
    consideration of the feasibility of relocating in Baghdad.

 5. The case came before Designated Judge Murray in the UT on 9  May  2017.
    Her decision promulgated on 12 June 2017 records  that  the  respondent
    conceded the first  ground,  but  not  the  second,  and  that  parties
    accepted "that further fact-finding will have to be undertaken by  both
    parties relating to internal relocation".  The Judge concluded:

      The findings of fact in the FtT decision shall stand.  With regard  to
      internal relocation both parties will require to produce further facts
      to support their arguments and a second stage hearing will be arranged
      before the UT based on internal relocation and the first issue  raised
      in the grounds.

 6. Pursuant to that decision and to a transfer order enabling the case  to
    be heard by a differently constituted tribunal, the case  came  on  for
    further hearing before me on 10 August 2017.

 7. Representatives, who had also appeared before Judge  Murray,  concurred
    in stating that they perceived some difficulty,  for  which  they  both
    accepted responsibility, in that there was a lack  of  clarity  in  the
    FtT's  findings  of  fact  (particularly  between  �30  and  32),   the
    consequences of which had not been thought through in arriving  at  the
    agreed outcome above.  They asked  for  adjournment,  and  for  further
    procedure to be adjusted as follows.

 8. The following issues of fact were not settled, and were  agreed  to  be
    open for decision, and for further evidence to be tendered:

      whether the appellant has a CSID;

      if not, whether he can obtain a CSID soon after return to Iraq;

      whether his father has died, and if so when;

      whether he is married, and if so, the  whereabouts  of  his  wife  and
      child;

      the whereabouts of his mother and sister;

      whether any family in Iraq can assist him to obtain a CSID before  his
      return;

      if he has family in Iraq, their circumstances and whereabouts.

 9. It was agreed that the findings of fact of the FtT stand to the  extent
    that the appellant's father was not a member of the Ba'ath  party,  and
    that issue has no bearing on his ability to relocate.

10. Directions were issued in the terms above, and the case was listed  for
    further hearing on 16 October 2017.  At  that  hearing,  the  appellant
    adopted his statements of 24  November  2016,  8  August  2017  and  12
    October 2017 as his evidence-in-chief, and was cross-examined.  Parties
    subsequently provided written submissions on the  final  resolution  of
    the case.  On 7 November 2017, they had nothing to add.

11. The first question is whether the appellant is a generally reliable and
    credible witness on those factual matters which remain outstanding

12. A point of departure is that he has already been  found  not  to  be  a
    satisfactory witness regarding his father's involvement in  the  Ba'ath
    party.  I accept, however, that an adverse finding in one respect  does
    not mean that the appellant may not be truthful about anything else.

13. It is argued for the appellant that omissions  at  screening  interview
    are explained by misunderstanding of the questions asked; the  tribunal
    should be slow to draw adverse inferences from omissions at a screening
    interview, given its nature; a misunderstanding made its way  into  his
    statement of 24 November 2016;  dates  were  wrongly  recorded  at  his
    substantive interview, and not noticed when that was read back to  him;
    lapse of time and lack of education should be taken into  account;  and
    he explained why he left his child behind when fleeing Isis.

14. Taking account of the above, and having  heard  and  reflected  on  the
    evidence as a whole, the applicant has not persuaded me that  he  is  a
    reliable witness, even to the lower standard.


15.  Some of the features of the evidence which have led to this conclusion
    are these:


   a. At screening interview, the appellant said he  fled  having  lost  his
      mother and sister and having nowhere to go.  He made no mention  of  a
      wife and child, although some of the questions were designed to elicit
      such information.  His later claim includes  a  history  of  having  a
      wife, who was killed by Isis, and a child, whom he left with a friend.


   b. In his statement of 24 November 2016, the appellant said his "parents"
      were missing.  Elsewhere, he said that his father died around  2002  -
      2004.  In cross-examination, he said that it was not his  two  parents
      who went missing, but his mother and sister, and  denied  ever  having
      told anyone that both his parents might still be alive.


   c. Questioned on his age, when he left school and went  to  work  on  his
      uncle's farm, and how events related to his father's  date  of  death,
      the appellant denied his plain evidence that he left  school  at  that
      time; claimed not to know, and to have made only a  rough  guess;  and
      suggested the explanation might be  that  he  had  repeated  years  at
      school, which "some pupils did".  He  then  said  that  he  could  not
      recall if he repeated a year, because he had not  been  taking  school
      seriously.  Although the questions  were  clear,  the  answers  became
      increasingly argumentative and defensive.  Details fade over time, but
      the appellant would be likely to remember such an important episode in
      his life as whether he left school and went to work at  the  time  his
      father died or at some other period.  The aspect of repeating years at
      school gave an impression of making  matters  up  as  he  went  along,
      rather than an honest attempt to recall the truth.


   d. The appellant told the presenting officer that he had always  given  3
      October 2012 as the date of his marriage, and was not aware of  giving
      any other date.  It then became clear, however, that he  was  recorded
      as giving other dates: at substantive interview, 30 October 2012; in a
      preliminary statement, January 2013; and at the hearing in the FtT,  7
      May 2013.  The appellant's explanation was that  "30th"  might  be  an
      error for "3rd", which is a possibility, and that he  never  gave  the
      other two dates, but he clearly had.  This is an unexplained series of
      discrepancies.


   e. The appellant claimed to have left his 2-month old son with a "friend"
      from his village,  who  did  not  appear  to  be  much  more  than  an
      acquaintance, and to be in the same danger from Isis,  with  no  clear
      idea of this person's plans for himself or for the child.  He said  he
      called this person from Turkey, and found out that he  and  the  child
      were then apparently safe in Kirkuk, but to stay with them would  have
      been impossible, because "there was just a little  friendship  between
      us"- which did not answer the question.  He  had  not  mentioned  this
      alleged call, two years  ago,  prior  to  cross-examination.   Persons
      fleeing extreme danger may have no choice to abandon helpless infants,
      as submitted for the appellant, but that is a very extreme step.   His
      evidence was very weak on this issue, containing no credible detail.


   f. Witnesses may or may not betray emotion on painful subjects;  but  his
      marriage, the death of his wife at the hands of Isis, the  abandonment
      of his infant son, and the absence of current knowledge about his  son
      and other relatives were all matters which did not apparently move the
      appellant in the slightest.


   g. The lack of persuasive detail and the appellant's indifference suggest
      that wife, son and lack of family contact are  all  fictitious  rather
      than real.



   h. While caution has to be exercised in  reaching  conclusions  based  on
      demeanour, the  appellant  made  a  generally  poor  impression  as  a
      witness.  He seldom gave a straight answer to a plain question, either
      on emotive or on unemotive matters. His only signs of  agitation  came
      when being put to explain weaknesses in  his  account,  not  from  the
      nature of horrific alleged events.  He resorted when in difficulty  at
      several points to blaming interpreters (and even the  FtT  judge)  for
      recorded inconsistencies in his evidence,  complaints  not  previously
      aired and not  all  going  to  matters  where  minor  slips  might  be
      expected, but to plain differences.

16. The appellant's final submissions  seek  a  favourable  outcome,  under
    reference to the guidance in AA Iraq CG [2015] UKUT  00544  (which  has
    been modified and set out as an annex to  AA  (Iraq)  [2017]  EWCA  Civ
    944), based on lack of a CSID or ability to obtain one, and absence  of
    family contact or assistance.

17. On the foregoing view of his credibility, no findings fall to  be  made
    in favour of the appellant on any outstanding matter.

18. The appellant fails to make a case that he has no CSID, would be in any
    difficulty  in  obtaining  or  replacing  such  a  document,  or  lacks
    assistance from family and friends.  There is no basis on which to find
    that he would be in any difficulty in relocating to the IKR.

19. There is no reason to think he  might  have  to  settle  for  the  less
    attractive option of Baghdad, but if he did, there is no reason to find
    that beyond him.

20. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal has  been  set  aside,  as
    narrated  above.   The  following   decision   is   substituted:    the
    appellant's appeal,  as  brought  to  the  FtT,  is  dismissed  on  all
    available grounds.

21. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
