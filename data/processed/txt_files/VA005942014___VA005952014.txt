Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr N Smart, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr A Gomez of Citadel Immigration Lawyers


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this decision the Appellant is  referred  to  as  the  ECO  and  the
    Respondents are referred to as the Claimants.

2.   The first and second Claimant, nationals of Southern  Sudan,  dates  of
    birth respectively 1 January 1938 and 1 January 1955, appealed  against
    the ECO's decisions dated 17 December 2013 to  refuse  entry  clearance
    with reference to paragraph 41 of the  Immigration  Rules  HC  395  (as
    amended) on the basis that the Appellants had not shown that it  was  a
    genuine visit and that they would leave at the end  of  the  period  of
    visit.

3.   The ECO's decisions did not attract a right  of  appeal  in  their  own
    right.  Rather when the matter came before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Sangha (the judge), who  on  21  August  2014  promulgated  a  decision
    allowing the appeals on Article 8  ECHR  rights  and  nevertheless  did
    consider the merits of an appeal against the paragraph 41 refusals.

4.   The ECO appealed the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Sangha  and
    permission was granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Frances  on  1
    October 2014.

5.   The position in law has slightly moved on in the sense that  there  has
    been greater clarification of the extent to  which  Article  8  may  be
    turned to in visit visa entry clearance cases with  references  to  the
    case of Mostafa (Article 8 in entry  clearance)  [2015]  UKUT  112  and
    Adjei (visit visas - Article 8) [2015] UKUT 261.  Mr Gomez  wholly  and
    properly as did Mr Smart drew these cases to my attention  as  well  as
    other cases around the issues not least Ghising (family life - adults -
    Gurkha policy) [2012] UKUT 160 (IAC).

6.   The problem  which  the  judge  faced  was  that  he  started  from  an
    examination of the merits of an appeal  against  paragraph  41  of  the
    Immigration Rules in respect of each Claimant and  having  found  those
    matters in favour of the Claimants then went on  to  conclude,  plainly
    with those points in mind, that the  appeal  of  the  Claimants  should
    succeed under Article 8.  It has troubled many courts  whether  or  not
    Article 8 can be turned to in such circumstances bearing in  mind  that
    removal of the right of appeal against the ECO decisions  was  intended
    to prevent any general opportunity to simply re-examine the merits.  It
    is quite plain from the cases of  Mostafa  and  Adjei  that  the  first
    question is whether Article 8 rights are actually engaged at all and it
    is only then if they are so engaged that one will  go  on  to  consider
    whether or not there was for example non-compliance with  paragraph  41
    of the Rules and  thus  being  or  becoming  a  material  fact  in  the
    proportionality exercise ultimately to be concluded.

7.   In this case it is  clear  that  the  Sponsor,  whose  credibility  and
    reliability was accepted and of whom there  is  no  personal  criticism
    whatsoever, gave evidence before the judge.  The  judge  was  impressed
    with the evidence and concluded that the Sponsor was a reliable witness
    of fact.  What the judge  did  not  actually  go  on  to  do  with  any
    thoroughness or indeed depth was to truly examine what was  the  family
    or possibly even private life basis of  the  relationship  between  the
    Sponsor, the son of the Claimants and them.  Rather, as is clear,  what
    was essentially being argued for perfectly understandable  reasons  was
    the opportunity for the Claimants  to  visit  the  United  Kingdom,  it
    plainly being a cheaper and more convenient means by which  they  could
    meet up as a family.  There was, on the examination that the judge did,
    no dependency going beyond normal emotional ties  in  the  relationship
    between the Sponsor and his parents.  No-one can gainsay the importance
    of such relationships but the question is whether or not the nature  of
    Article 8 ECHR rights, which is plainly fact-sensitive, were  shown  to
    be engaged.  The findings that the judge made recognised the  emotional
    relationship that is to be expected between son and parents  but  there
    was no dependency by them on him nor by him on them.  Therein lies  the
    practical problem that the Sponsor, Mr Kulang, faced and he set out the
    reasons why he cannot visit Sudan and his UK commitments  of  work  and
    children at school and the effects of interruption upon their education
    and presumably the cost constraints that obviously arose for  him  upon
    meeting in a third country.

8.   Taking the positive findings of fact made in favour  of  the  Claimants
    and the Sponsor, it is my conclusion that the Original  Tribunal  erred
    in the assessment of whether or not Article 8 ECHR rights were actually
    engaged or that the ECO's decision was a  significant  interference  in
    the exercise of such rights.   I  do  not  for  one  minute  doubt  the
    genuineness of the Sponsor's wish to see the Claimants  in  the  United
    Kingdom but I do not find that Article 8 was the means to do so.

9.   For this reason I therefore find that the Original Tribunal's  decision
    was in error of law in allowing the appeals under Article 8.

10.  Reliant upon the findings made by the judge I reach  in  the  light  of
    the Court of Appeal decision in Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ  31  that  the
    connection between the Sponsor and his parents is ongoing in the  sense
    of financial dependency upon the Sponsor and in the sense that as their
    child there remains the inevitable continuing connection of sympathy in
    connections between parents and their son.  However, in  this  case  of
    course the Sponsor is an adult, formally recognised as  a  refugee  and
    now a British national with his  family  and  children  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  I do not find in the light of the case law that there is  the
    necessary dependency over and above that generally contemplated as  may
    exist between the children of  parents  and  any  continuing  financial
    obligations or dependency by  them.   I  appreciate  that  there  is  a
    practical difficulty so far as the Sponsor judges the position as to  a
    return to South Sudan. Nevertheless  I  conclude  that  that  practical
    difficulty is not material in assessing dependency.  It may be entirely
    material to the question of proportionality but upon  the  findings  of
    fact made and the submissions made to me  I  am  satisfied  that  as  a
    matter of law there  is  not  the  necessary  dependency  to  establish
    Article 8(1) rights are engaged.

11.  In those  circumstances  the  findings  of  fact,  as  opposed  to  the
    conclusions drawn therefrom, made by the judge plainly indicate that at
    the date the matter was considered by the judge he found the  Claimants
    reliable in the sense of  coming  for  the  purposes  of  a  visit  and
    intending to leave at the conclusion of  the  visit.   The  judge  also
    found that the Sponsor had sufficient means and was a reliable  witness
    of fact.  Plainly, if any further  application  is  made  it  would  be
    useful to have particular regard to the ECO's reasons  for  refusal  in
    terms of the points  that  he  took  against  the  credibility  of  the
    Claimants.

12.  In this respect it seems to me also that the fact  that  the  Claimants
    have not previously travelled to the United  Kingdom  from  their  home
    country cannot of itself be a reliable indicator of anything other than
    that fact.  A wider picture in terms of their  intention  needs  to  be
    addressed and those are matters for a further  application  based  upon
    those considerations and reliant upon the  positive  findings  of  fact
    made by the judge.

13.  The Original Tribunal's decision was in error of law in the  assessment
    of Article 8 ECHR.

14.   The  appeal  of  the  ECO  is  allowed.   The  following  decision  is
    substituted.
