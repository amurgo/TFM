                            DECISION AND REASONS




         Background

      1. This appeal comes before me following the grant  of  permission  to
         appeal to the appellant by First-tier Tribunal Judge Wilson  on  27
         May 2020 against the determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         Scott-Baker, promulgated on 7 January 2020 following a  hearing  at
         Taylor House on 25 October 2019.

      2. The appellant is a Nigerian national born on 12 September 1972.  he
         appears to have entered the UK unlawfully in 2005 with the help  of
         an agent. No details are provided for what he did then  or  why  he
         had chosen to enter  in  that  way.  In  2009  he  married  an  EEA
         national. He was issued with a residence card in November 2010  but
         that was revoked on 18 May 2015 when his application for  permanent
         residence  was  refused.  His  appeal  against  that  decision  was
         dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Bradshaw in October 2016 and
         the decision was upheld on appeal by Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
         Roberts in July 2017. The appellant then sought a residence card on
         retained rights of residence in October 2018. That was  refused  on
         12 February 2019 and he now appeals that decision.

      3. The respondent did not accept that the appellant's former wife  had
         been a qualified person or had the right of permanent residence  at
         the relevant time. The previous  decisions  of  the  Tribunal  were
         relied upon which raised concerns over whether the EEA national had
         been employed throughout the requisite period. In  support  of  his
         current application the appellant had provided  payslips  and  P60s
         for his former spouse but the respondent made checks and found them
         to be false. Checks with HMRC disclosed no record of  employment  /
         income for the tax year 2013/2014  which  would  have  covered  the
         period when divorce proceedings were initiated. The application was
         accordingly refused under reg. 10(5).

      4. The appellant was not in attendance when the  hearing  came  before
         Judge Scott-Baker however the appellant's  representative  attended
         and explained that the appellant had felt  sick  and  had  gone  to
         hospital. An adjournment was requested. The  judge  indicated  that
         she would give the appellant seven days to submit evidence  of  his
         illness. The judge stated: "Even if such evidence was received  the
         appeal would be determined on the evidence that there was before me
         at the hearing save that Mr Omoniruvbe would have  the  opportunity
         to make written submissions provided that the same were received by
         4 pm on Friday 1 November 2019" (at 8). As of 7 January  2020  when
         the determination was signed, no further evidence had  been  placed
         before the judge. The judge proceeded to determine the  appeal  and
         dismissed it.

      5. The appellant lodged a successful  application  for  permission  to
         appeal on 15 January 2020. He adduced with his grounds a copy of  a
         fax sent to Taylor House on 28 October 2019 which  had  included  a
         hospital attendance card for 25 October 2019.  The  grounds  argued
         that the appellant should not be disadvantaged by  the  failure  of
         the administrative staff to place the evidence before the judge. It
         was argued that the refusal by the judge to relist the  appeal  was
         procedurally unfair.

         Covid-19 crisis: preliminary matters

      6. The matter would have normally been listed  for  hearing  following
         the grant of permission, but due  to  the  pandemic  this  did  not
         happen and  on  5  August  2020  directions  were  issued  instead,
         inviting the parties to make submissions on the proposal  that  the
         appeal be determined on the papers. Submissions were  also  invited
         as to the merits.

      7. The appellant replied on 17 August 2020. There has been no response
         from the Secretary of State, as far as I am aware.

      8. I now consider whether this matter can be determined on the papers.
         In doing  so  I  have  regard  to  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
         Tribunal) Rules 2008 (the UT Rules), the judgment of Osborn  v  The
         Parole Board [2013] UKSC 61, the Presidential Guidance  Note  No  1
         2020: Arrangements during  the  Covid-19  pandemic  (PGN)  and  the
         Senior President's Pilot Practice Direction (PPD). I have regard to
         the overriding objective which is defined in rule 2 of the Tribunal
         Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 as being "to enable the Upper
         Tribunal to deal with cases fairly and justly". To this end I  have
         considered that dealing with a case  fairly  and  justly  includes:
         dealing with it in ways that are proportionate to the importance of
         the case, the complexity of the issues, etc;  avoiding  unnecessary
         formality and seeking flexibility in the proceedings; ensuring,  so
         far as practicable, that the parties are able to participate  fully
         in the proceedings;  using  any  special  expertise  of  the  Upper
         Tribunal effectively; and avoiding delay, so far as compatible with
         proper consideration of the issues (Rule 2(2) UT rules and PGN:5).

      9. I have had regard to the submissions and to all the evidence before
         deciding how to proceed.  I  note  that  despite  being  given  the
         opportunity  the   appellant's   representatives   have   made   no
         submissions on the manner in which the error of law issue should be
         determined. I assume their silence to mean they do not object to  a
         paper decision.

     10. I am satisfied that the directions  were  properly  served  on  the
         respondent and that she has had the opportunity to  reply  but  has
         declined to do so.

     11. I take the view that a full account of the facts  are  set  out  in
         those papers, that the arguments for and against the appellant have
         been clearly set  out  and  that  the  issues  to  be  decided  are
         straightforward. There are no matters arising from the papers which
         would require clarification and so an oral  hearing  would  not  be
         needed for that purpose. I have regard to  the  importance  of  the
         matter to the appellant and consider that a speedy determination of
         this matter is in his best interests. I am satisfied  that  neither
         party would be disadvantaged by a paper determination and that I am
         able to fairly and justly deal with this  matter  on  the  evidence
         before me.

         Submissions

     12. The appellant repeats his grounds in his submissions. It is  argued
         that evidence of his attendance at a hospital on the  date  of  his
         hearing had been forwarded to Taylor House within  the  seven  days
         permitted by the judge and that the appellant had been deprived  of
         a fair hearing by the judge's failure to relist the appeal.

     13. With respect to the merits of the appeal, it is submitted that  the
         appellant's ex-spouse was a qualified person at  the  date  of  the
         commencement of divorce proceedings in May 2014[1] and also at  the
         date of the termination of the marriage in September  2014.  It  is
         submitted that  the  previous  judge  had  accepted  the  sponsor's
         earnings of ï¿½350 a month over a five month period between  May  and
         September 2014.   Reliance is placed on a letter from the sponsor's
         former employer, Heathfield Solutions, dated 14 May 2019 confirming
         she was employed by them between March 2013 and September 2014.  It
         is submitted that if the sponsor's employer did not deduct national
         insurance contributions and tax from her  earnings,  the  appellant
         should not be penalised. It is submitted that the appellant was and
         still is in full time employment, that the  marriage  lasted  three
         years and that they lived in the UK during that time. The  Tribunal
         is invited  to  set  aside  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge and to allow the appeal or remit it for re-hearing.

         Discussion and conclusions

     14. I have considered the evidence, the determination, the grounds  for
         permission and the submissions.

     15. I deal first  with  the  complaint  that  there  was  a  procedural
         irregularity in the making of the decision in this appeal.  I  have
         had sight of the attendance note and the accompanying fax  sent  on
         28 October 2019. I note that neither the fax nor the  note  was  on
         the Tribunal file when the judge came to determine the  appeal  but
         it is clear that a fax was sent by  the  solicitors  in  accordance
         with the judge's instructions and I am satisfied that it  was  sent
         to the Taylor House fax number.  Whatever the reason, the documents
         were not passed on to the judge.

     16. I would note here, however, that the judge's clear instructions  as
         can be seen from the determination and the  Record  of  Proceedings
         were that even if evidence of the appellant's illness was  adduced,
         and there has been no evidence or details  of  the  nature  of  the
         illness, she would make her decision on the basis of  the  evidence
         already before her but that she would allow written submissions  to
         be made. No such submissions were forwarded to the Tribunal by  the
         appellant's representatives and no explanation for the  failure  to
         do so has been offered.

     17. Nevertheless, the judge proceeded on a factually incorrect  premise
         because she was under  the  impression  that  no  evidence  of  the
         appellant's failure to attend his hearing had been sent,  when  the
         evidence now shows that it had. That amounts to an error of law.

     18. I now turn to the issue  of  whether  the  error  is  material  and
         whether I can set aside the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge and allow the appeal as the appellant's representatives urge.

     19. The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal Judge did  not  greatly
         assist  the  appellant's  case.  Whilst  the   documents   in   the
         appellant's bundle from  Heathfields  Solutions  confirm  that  the
         sponsor was employed by them between March 2013 and September 2014,
         the payslips in the supplementary bundle from  the  respondent  are
         from a different employer even though at least one covers the  same
         period. They also show the sponsor residing at a different address.
         The P60 for the year ending 5  April  2014  show  a  third  alleged
         employer. HMRC records,  however,  show  no  employment  or  income
         details for  2010-2011,  2012-2013,  2013-2014  or  2014-2015.  The
         evidence as recorded in the determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge Bradshaw dismissing the appellant's appeal  in  October  2016
         was that there was a P60 showing the sponsor worked for  Heathfield
         Solutions in 2009/2010 (not referred to in  the  letter  from  that
         company now relied on) (at paragraph 17). The  evidence  previously
         given to the Tribunal by the appellant as to the sponsor's hours of
         work a week conflicted with the documentary  evidence  also  relied
         upon. None of these issues have been engaged with  in  the  present
         written submissions. Clearly  they  need  to  be  resolved  if  the
         appellant has any hope of succeeding in his appeal.  This  is  not,
         therefore, an appeal that I can allow as the appellant  invites  me
         to do.

     20. I, therefore, set aside the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge as it was procedurally unfair for the judge,  though  through
         no fault of her own, to proceed to  determine  the  appeal  on  the
         mistaken belief that the appellant had not  forwarded  evidence  of
         his hospital attendance as directed.

     21. The  appellant  seeks  remittal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  In
         accordance  with  the  Senior  President's  Practice  Statement  at
         7.2(a), I am satisfied that the appellant has been  deprived  of  a
         fair hearing and that remittal is the appropriate course of  action
         in these circumstances.




         Decision

     22. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains errors of law  and
         it is set aside. A fresh decision shall be made by another judge of
         the First-tier Tribunal at a date to be arranged.




         Anonymity

     23. No application for anonymity has been made at any stage and  I  see
         no reason to make one.

         Directions

     24. Directions shall be issued in due course by the First-tier Tribunal
         at Taylor House.




    Signed


    R. Keki?


    Upper Tribunal Judge
