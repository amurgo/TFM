Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr K Manzur, Morgan Hall Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. The Appellant Mohammed Shoaib was born on 28 December 1986; and, on 31
      December 2010, he married Zenib Begum Mehmood, a British citizen.

   2. In June 2012, the Appellant applied for entry clearance to the  United
      Kingdom to join, and  settle  with,  his  spouse  and  sponsor.   That
      application was refused by the Secretary of State on 15 November 2012,
      on the basis that the Appellant had failed to satisfy the requirements
      of paragraph 281(iii) and (v) of the Immigration Rules, namely that:


          "(iii) each of the parties intends to live  permanently  with  the
          other as his or her spouse or civil partner and  the  marriage  or
          civil partnership is subsisting;


          ...


          (v) the parties will  be  able  to  maintain  themselves  and  any
          dependants adequately without recourse to public funds."


3.    The  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and,   in   a
       determination promulgated on 28 November 2013, Tribunal  Judge  Prior
       found that the requirement in  (iii)  had  been  met,  but  that  the
       requirement in (v) had not.  He thus refused  the  appeal  under  the
       Rules, and also found that the refusal of the Appellant's application
       for leave to enter was not a disproportionate interference  with  the
       family life of him or his wife.  With permission, the  Appellant  now
       appeals against the dismissal of his appeal.

4.   Judge Prior dealt with the maintenance issue in  paragraph  13  of  his
       determination as follows:

          "Having regard to the documentary evidence  before  me,  including
          the P60 issued for the sponsor for the tax year to 5th April  2013
          recording gross pay of �14,407 I accepted that after deductions of
          tax and National Insurance the sponsor's net  monthly  income  was
          �1,027.  It was the sponsor's testimony and the  evidence  of  the
          landlord's letter of 11th November 2013 that she was subject to  a
          monthly rental obligation - discharged by her - of �450.   It  was
          the sponsor's testimony that she paid, in addition, �150 per month
          by way of council tax.  This left the sponsor  with  a  disposable
          income of �427 per month.  Since  the  appellant's  representative
          did not challenge the income support figure for 2012 of �111 for a
          couple and the onus lay upon the Appellant to satisfy me that,  in
          accordance with the requirements of the Rules, the couple would be
          able to maintain themselves without recourse to  public  funds,  I
          adopted the figure of �111 per week.  Converting that figure to  a
          monthly figure of �481 I concluded that the  sponsor's  disposable
          income of �427 fell  short  of  that  required  for  the  couple's
          adequate maintenance.  Accordingly I was not  satisfied  that  the
          couple met the requirements of the rules."




5.   In attractively  focused  submissions,  Mr  Manzur  on  behalf  of  the
       Appellant submitted that the judge erred in two respects.  First, he
       misrecorded the sponsor's council tax as �150 per month, whereas she
       said in her evidence - as was the case in fact - that  it  was  �115
       per month.  It is said that that was a simple, but important,  slip.
       Second, the judge failed to take into account the sponsor's savings,
       held in Nationwide Savings Accounts.  Had the judge taken those  two
       matters into account as he should, then  it  is  submitted  that  he
       could only have concluded that the Appellant and his  sponsor  would
       be able to support themselves without recourse to public funds.



6.   On the basis of the evidence before the judge, we  are  satisfied  that
       the correct amount of council tax was indeed �115, and not �150, per
       month.  The figure of �115 was given by the sponsor  when  she  gave
       her evidence, but, as conceded by Mr Nath before  us,  unfortunately
       misheard and recorded by the judge in his record of  proceedings  as
       �150.  That the �115 figure was  correct  is  supported  by  figures
       taken from the relevant council's website for the appropriate  band.





7.            We  are  also  satisfied  that  the  sponsor  had  substantial
       building society savings.  The judge referred to �14,000 (paragraph 7
       of the determination), a  figure  coming  from  paragraph  8  of  the
       sponsor's statement of 11 November 2013 as the sum then in  her  main
       account.  However, the relevant time  is  when  the  application  was
       made, and, in June 2012, the figure shown in her  then  sole  account
       was  something  over  �8,500.   The   supporting   building   society
       statements show that that was  the  lowest  amount  held  by  her  in
       savings in the period from June 2012 to the end of 2013.



8.   It is well-established that, in assessing  whether  the  Appellant  and
       his sponsor would be able to support themselves without recourse  to
       public funds, where the likely income is insufficient, the shortfall
       can be met by savings, on the basis that those savings are available
       to meet the shortfall.  By Paragraph 282(a) of the Rules, the period
       of leave for a spouse who is allowed entry under the relevant  parts
       of paragraph 281 is restricted to 27 months.   If  the  savings  are
       sufficient to meet the shortfall  for  the  period  of  the  initial
       leave, and there is no reason to believe that the applicant and  his
       sponsor will not be able to meet the maintenance requirements in the
       longer term, then he is entitled to entry clearance (see,  e.g.,  KA
       and Others (Adequacy of Maintenance) Pakistan  [2006]  UKAIT  00065;
       Jahangara Begum and Others (Maintenance - Savings) Bangladesh [2011]
       UKUT 00246 (IAC)).



9.   The judge found that the  sponsor's  monthly  income  net  of  tax  and
       National Insurance was �1,027.  He found that her  monthly  rent  was
       �450 - evidenced by a letter from her landlord, and  uncontentious  -
       and, as we have found, her  monthly  council  tax  burden  was  �115,
       leaving a disposable monthly income  of  �462.   The  income  support
       figure for a couple in 2012  was  �481  per  month.   The  disposable
       income therefore fell short by �19 per month.  However, over a period
       of 27 months, the  aggregate  shortfall  would  be  only  �513.   The
       sponsor's savings were, clearly, more than sufficient to  meet  that.
       There is no reason to believe that the couple will  not  be  able  to
       meet the maintenance requirements in the  longer  term;  indeed,  the
       amount and rate of savings suggests that they  will  continue  to  be
       able to support themselves without recourse to public  funds  in  the
       longer term.  But in any event, however that may  be,  we  are  quite
       satisfied that, on the  evidence  before  the  tribunal  below,  they
       demonstrated an ability to support  themselves  without  recourse  to
       public funds during the course of the next 27 months.



Decision



10.  For those  reasons,  the  Immigration  Judge  erred  in  law;  and  his
       decision is set aside.  It is remade  as  follows:  the  Appellant's
       appeal against the Secretary of State's refusal of  his  application
       for entry clearance is allowed under the Immigration  Rules.   As  a
       result, it  is  unnecessary  for  us  to  consider  the  Appellant's
       alternative arguments under Article 8.
