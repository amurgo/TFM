               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr A Caskie, Advocate, instructed by Latta & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. Designated FtT Judge Murray  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  by  a
    decision dated 31 May 2017.


 2. The appellant's grounds of appeal to the UT, stated in his  application
    for permission dated 24 July 2017, quote �457 of AB and  others  (Iran)
    [2015] UKUT 00257 and continue:

      ... upon return to the airport in Iran ... a "pinch point" is  created
      where under interrogation the appellant will  be  asked  for  his  own
      Facebook login details. Upon provision of same ... it will be clear to
      the Iranian authorities from logging on  to  the  appellant's  account
      that the appellant has engaged in activities which oppose the  Iranian
      regime and are critical of that regime ... the appellant is at risk of
      persecution as a result.

 3. Mr Caskie began his submissions thus:

      i) Evidence which was before the FtT - screenshots, with  translations
         of captions imposed -  showed the appellant (with  others)  engaged
         in defacing photographs of Iranian clerics  and  making  derogatory
         gestures against them.

     ii) The judge said at �59 that the photographs would  not  put  him  in
         danger "because it would be difficult to pick him out ... and he is
         not named."  He was not named, but he was easy to pick out.

    iii) If those materials appeared on the appellant's own  Facebook  page,
         as stated in the grounds, the error of law would be plain, and  the
         appellant's case would be established.

 4. Mr Caskie acknowledged that the materials are not from the  appellant's
    own Facebook page but from the Facebook page of the KDPI  in  Scotland,
    and that the grounds could therefore not succeed.

 5. Undaunted, however, Mr Caskie submitted that the decision  of  the  FtT
    should  be  set  aside,  and  a  decision  substituted,  allowing   the
    appellant's appeal, because:

      i) The appellant would be returned to  Iran  on  travel  documentation
         marking him out as a returnee.

     ii) The authorities would ask him where he had been, and  what  he  had
         been doing.

    iii) He could not be expected to lie.

     iv) It had to be assumed that he would state that he had made  a  false
         asylum claim, posing as a supporter of the KDPI,  and  engaging  in
         activities denigrating the Iranian regime and its leaders.

      v) As a result, he would be at risk of persecution.

 6. Mr Matthews submitted thus:

      i) The appellant was fixed with his grounds of appeal.

     ii) The grounds were founded on a factual  inaccuracy,  without  which,
         permission would not have been granted.  Once the factual basis was
         removed, there was nothing left.

    iii) The submission now made was not foreshadowed in the grounds.  There
         had been no application to amend them.

     iv) If an application was made, it should not be granted at  this  very
         late stage.

      v) If the line of  argument  indicated  was  to  be  entertained,  the
         respondent should be granted an adjournment to consider it  and  to
         prepare a reply.

 7. Mr Caskie in  reply  said  that  the  respondent's  representative  was
    capable of dealing with the issue without notice.

 8. I reserved my decision.

 9. The grounds on which permission was  granted,  as  has  been  conceded,
    cannot succeed.

10. In order to decide whether to permit  a  (very)  late  amendment,  some
    consideration has to be given to  the  apparent  strength  of  the  new
    ground advanced.

11. I do not find the "new ground" to be of arguable strength, and  not  of
    such strength as to allow late amendment, for several reasons:

      i) The line of argument was not put to the FtT.

     ii) The line of  argument  involves  a  number  of  rather  far-fetched
         suggestions, and is far from being so obvious that  it  might  have
         been an error of law to overlook it.

    iii) The appellant had not established, or  even  sought  to  establish,
         that he is entitled to have his case considered on an assumption of
         enforced return.  Refusal to return voluntarily, where that  course
         is available, does not qualify  for  protection,  as  a  matter  of
         general  principle:  see  e.g.  Macdonald's  Immigration  Law   and
         Practice, 9th ed., �12.24, citing AA v SSHD, LK v SSHD [2006]  EWCA
         Civ 401, [2006] NLJR 681, [2007] 1 WLR 3134.  Put another  way,  "A
         person cannot rely on their own failings (as where they do not  co-
         operate  in  securing  valid  travel   documentation)   to   obtain
         international  protection":   Macdonald's   Immigration   Law   and
         Practice, 9th ed., �12.28, citing HF v SSHD (Iraq) [2013] EWCA  Civ
         1276.

     iv) If the appellant overcame the above, he would have to show that  as
         a matter of law he is entitled to an assumption that he would  tell
         his national authorities, against his own interests, of  activities
         he undertook in bad faith - a considerable stretching of  the  case
         law.  There would be no sensible reason to find as a fact  that  he
         would tell them.

      v) Somewhat similar arguments in cases of activities at low level  and
         in bad faith were rejected by the UT and by the Court of Appeal  in
         SSH and HR (illegal exit: failed asylum seeker) Iran CG [2016] UKUT
         00308 (IAC) (see the headnote, and  �23,  29-30,  and  34)  and  AS
         (Iran) [2017 EWCA Civ 1539 (�32-33).

12. If I had thought there might be real potential in the line of argument,
    I would have granted time to the respondent.  In light  of  my  initial
    consideration, however, I decline  to  permit  amendment,  dismiss  the
    appellant's appeal to the UT, and direct that the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal shall stand.

13. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
