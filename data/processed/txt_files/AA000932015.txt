Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr Howard, instructed by Morden Solicitors LLP
For the respondent:    Mrs R Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant has appealed against the decision of First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Boylan-Kemp promulgated 11.3.15, dismissing on  all  grounds  his
    appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State, dated  26.11.14,
    to refuse his asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights  claims,
    and on 27.11.14, to removed him from the UK. The Judge heard the appeal
    on 16.2.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Clayton  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    9.4.15.  However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Smith granted permission  to  appeal  on
    grounds 2, 3 & 4 only.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 18.4.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out briefly below, I find such error of law in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  as  to  require  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal to be set aside.

 5. It follows from the grant of permission that grounds 1, 5 and 6  cannot
    be pursued and the judge's findings that the appellant  did  not  leave
    Eritrea illegally, that he was over the age of 18, and that  article  8
    ECHR is not engaged must stand as made.

 6. What remains arguable is that the judge failed  to  adequately  address
    the following: the risk on return as a failed asylum seeker;  the  risk
    on return on the basis that he may be perceived to  have  left  Eritrea
    illegally; and the risk on return of persecution by reason of liability
    to indefinite national service in the military and the conditions under
    which he would have  to  serve.  Grounds  2,  3,  and  4  set  out  the
    appellant's case very simply on these issues. In  summary  it  is  that
    there was ample background information in relation  to  each  of  these
    issues before the judge, contained in the appellant's bundle. Mr Howard
    took me to the appellant's bundle and the background information in the
    OGN section 3.12.3 to 3.12.20, and the COIR 9.19 to 9.25 to  show  that
    there was material supporting the appellant's case on these issues. The
    judge  may  have  reached  the  conclusion  that  notwithstanding  this
    evidence there was no risk on return, but the fact is the judge did not
    address the evidence and made no reasoned findings in respect of  these
    issues.

 7. Ms Pettersen did not in fact resist  the  appeal,  accepting  that  the
    background material referred was before the judge.  She  conceded  that
    notwithstanding the judge's clear credibility  findings  rejecting  the
    appellant's factual account, the judge failed to adequately address the
    risk on return.

 8. In specific relation to the risk on  return  for  the  appellant  being
    required to undertake national service, Ms Pettersen accepted that  �45
    of the decision was inadequate. The judge's statement that no  evidence
    had been provided that the conditions of  military  service  themselves
    would be so harsh as to amount to persecution. In fact, the OGN  states
    that Eritreans who are forcibly returned, or return  voluntarily,  will
    be subject to conscription in the military service if they satisfy  the
    age criteria and are medically fit. It is also repeatedly  stated  that
    the period of national service is frequently extended indefinitely  and
    those who face being drafted into military service may  be  exposed  to
    forced labour for an indefinite period of time, given  inadequate  food
    and medical care and suffer arbitrary arrest and  detention  for  minor
    infractions. Punishment for military offences  is  carried  out  extra-
    judicially. This applies whether or  not  an  individual  left  Eritrea
    illegally.

 9. In relation to the issue of potentially being perceived as having  left
    Eritrea illegally, Mr Howard pointed me to �133 MO  (Illegal  exit-risk
    on return) Eritrea CG [2011] UKAIT 190 (IAC), where the Upper  Tribunal
    stated that on present evidence the great majority of returning  failed
    asylum seekers "are likely to be perceived as having left illegally and
    this fact, save for very limited exceptions, will mean that  on  return
    they face a real risk of persecution or serious  harm."  The  point  is
    that even though the judge found the appellant's  claim  that  he  left
    Eritrea illegally was not credible, the judge failed to identify  which
    of  the  very  limited  categories  of  exceptions,  mainly  comprising
    government  officials  and  their  families,  who  will  be   able   to
    demonstrate that they did not leave illegally. On the evidence  of  the
    appellant's background, it appears that he would not meet any of  those
    categories. I do not make such a finding, but  it  is  clear  that  the
    judge failed to take this risk of 'perception'  of  illegal  exit  into
    account in a risk on return assessment.

10. In relation to returning failed asylum seekers, at �6.5 the OGN records
    Amnesty International reports of  numerous  cases  of  returned  asylum
    seekers arbitrarily detained and subjected to  torture  or  other  ill-
    treatment, "and it is believed that this may  apply  to  a  significant
    majority of  forcibly-returned  asylum  seekers."  Mr  Howard  drew  my
    attention to other similar  information  contained  in  the  background
    material. It does not follow that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  would
    necessarily have reached the conclusion that there was such a  risk  on
    return, but the fact remains that it was not considered at all.

11. In the circumstances, the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  cannot
    stand and must be set aside.

12. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where crucial issue at the heart of
    an appeal have not been resolved, as in this  case,  effectively  there
    has not been a valid decision on the appeal.

13. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties
    to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I
    do so on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within  the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of
    the error has been to deprive the appellant of a fair hearing and  that
    the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding  which  is  necessary
    for the decision in the appeal to  be  re-made  is  such  that,  having
    regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with cases  fairly
    and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I find  that  it  is
    appropriate  to  remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh in accordance with the attached directions.

14. As stated above, the remaining findings of the First-tier  Tribunal  as
    to the appellant's  age,  the  human  rights  decision,  and  that  the
    appellant did not leave Eritrea illegally as  claimed  must  stand.  In
    effect, all the credibility findings must stand. It follows  from  that
    it is only the risk on return that will be at issue in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Conclusions:

15. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the making of the decision in the appeal to  the
                    First-tier Tribunal to be remade.

Consequential Directions

16. The appeal is remitted to be remade in the First-tier Tribunal  sitting
    at Birmingham;

17. The appeal is to be limited to the sole issue of risk on return on  the
    basis of the judge's findings as to  credibility,  including  that  the
    appellant did not leave Eritrea as claimed, was over the age of 18, and
    that his human rights are not engaged on the basis of the evidence that
    was then before the First-tier Tribunal.

18. However, if significant further evidence as to the  claimant's  private
    and/or family life is adduced so as to  demonstrate  the  circumstances
    have changed since the date of the First-tier Tribunal appeal  hearing,
    the Tribunal may need to reassess that issue as  at  the  date  of  the
    appeal hearing;

19. The appeal may be listed before any  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  other
    than Judge Boyan-Kemp and Judge Clayton;

20. The estimated length of appeal is 3 hours;

21. It is anticipated that the claimant and  one  other  person  will  give
    evidence;

22. Not later than 10 working days before the listed appeal,  the  claimant
    must submit a  single  revised,  consolidated,  indexed  and  paginated
    bundle comprising all subjective and objective materials to  be  relied
    on, together with copies of any case  law  or  skeleton  argument.  The
    Tribunal will not accept materials submitted on the day of hearing.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. Mr Howard requested anonymity. The First-tier  Tribunal
did not make an order. Given the circumstances, I make an anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
