For the Respondent:    Mr Hiran Patel, Hiren Patel Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State, but  for  convenience  we
    will  refer  to  the  appellant  below  as  the  appellant   in   these
    proceedings.

 2. The appellant is Pinkeshkumar Mahendrabhai Patel, a citizen  of  India,
    born 14 March 1990.  The Secretary of State appeals against a  decision
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Blake promulgated on 9 April 2019 allowing
    the appellant's appeal against a decision of  the  respondent  dated  7
    March 2016 to refuse his application for  leave  to  remain  under  the
    points-based system as a Tier  2  (General)  Migrant  submitted  on  13
    January 2015.

 3. This matter has a relatively complex procedural history. It  originally
    came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Herbert who, in  a  decision  and
    reasons promulgated on 7 February 2018, allowed the appellant's appeal.
    The Secretary of State appealed against  that  decision.  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Davey allowed the appeal and remitted  it  back  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for a rehearing. It was in those circumstances that
    the matter was listed before Judge Blake.  Following  the  decision  of
    Judge Blake to allow the appeal, the Secretary  of  State  appealed  to
    this  tribunal  with  the  permission  of  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge
    Grimmett, on a basis we set out below.

Factual background

 4. The appellant entered the United Kingdom with leave as a student  on  9
    November 2009, valid until 31  January  2013.  Following  a  successful
    appeal, the appellant's leave to remain was extended until 17  February
    2014, and was later extended again, until 30 November 2015.   All these
    grants of leave were under the Tier 4 student regime.   On  13  January
    2015, the appellant applied for leave as a Tier  2  (General)  Migrant.
    That application was refused, and it is that refusal decision which  is
    under consideration in these proceedings.

 5. The Secretary of State refused the appellant's January 2015 application
    for leave to remain on two bases. First, the appellant was said to have
    used a proxy test taker to sit an  English  language  test  at  Colwell
    College, Leicester, on 19 September 2012. As a result, the Secretary of
    State concluded that the appellant's conduct  made  it  undesirable  to
    allow him to remain in the United Kingdom and refused  his  application
    for further leave to remain under paragraph 322(5) of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 6.  The  Secretary  of  State  gave  another  reason  for   refusing   the
    application. The appellant had provided a "certificate of  sponsorship"
    in support of  his  application  under  the  points-based  system.  The
    refusal letter said this:

         "Your Certificate of Sponsorship (COS) does not provide  sufficient
         information to show that this job is a  genuine  vacancy.  On  this
         occasion,  as  we  are  refusing  your  application  on  additional
         grounds,  we  have  not  sought  further  information   about   the
         employment stated on the COS. We  are  therefore  unable  to  award
         points for sponsorship. Should a further application  be  made  for
         this specific employment, that meets all  other  Tier  2  criteria;
         [sic] additional information would be sought if  the  COS  did  not
         provide sufficient information to show  that  the  position  was  a
         genuine vacancy..."

 7. Judge Blake allowed the appeal on the  basis  that  the  appellant  had
    satisfied him that he had  attended  an  English  language  test  at  a
    satellite college of Colwell College, the College of Advanced  Studies,
    near Aldgate East in London. Before Judge Herbert in the first  appeal,
    as before Judge Blake, the appellant had maintained that he attended  a
    test at this test centre, in his own capacity, and that he had not used
    a  proxy.  The  appellant  had  not  provided  any  other   information
    demonstrating the  existence  of  this  satellite  college,  which  the
    Secretary of State  contended  did  not  exist,  and  was  a  fictional
    creation of the appellant. Judge Blake  did  not  deal  in  substantive
    terms with the issue of the COS.

Permission to appeal

 8. Judge Grimmett granted permission to appeal on the basis  that  it  was
    arguable that the judge erred in accepting that the appellant took  his
    English language test at a satellite  college  in  circumstances  where
    there was no evidence to support such a claim, given  the  respondent's
    own records suggested that  the  appellant  sat  the  test  at  Colwell
    College in Leicester. Judge Grimmett said it was  arguable  that  Judge
    Blake had overlooked the COS issue.

Submissions

 9. The Secretary of State's submissions  are  essentially  a  rationality-
    based challenge to the judge's approach to  the  appellant's  evidence.
    The Secretary of State contends that there was no rational  basis  upon
    which the judge was able to accept the appellant's evidence that he had
    taken his English language test at a hitherto unknown satellite college
    of Colwell College. The respondent highlights the  complete  dearth  of
    any evidence supporting that  contention,  noting  that  there  was  no
    reference to the existence  of  a  satellite  college  in  any  of  the
    supporting documentation submitted with the appeal, on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State, or  on  behalf  of  the  appellant.  Taken  at  its
    highest, contends the presenting officer, the judge  accepted  a  bald,
    unsubstantiated assertion made by the appellant, in the absence of  any
    of the  supporting  documentary  evidence  which  would  ordinarily  be
    expected, and which would be readily available, were it the case that a
    satellite college existed.

10. The appellant had not sought to obtain or provide the audio  recordings
    of the test itself which, pursuant to Ahsan v Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 2009 at [33], makes the  allegation
    that he cheated "hard to resist".

11. The presenting officer also submitted that the judge erred  in  law  by
    failing to make any findings concerning the COS issue.

12. For the appellant, Mr Patel highlighted the approach taken  in  earlier
    authorities such as SM and Qadir (ETS - Evidence  -  Burden  of  Proof)
    [2016] UKUT 229, which  highlighted  the  need  for  those  accused  of
    English language testing fraud to provide  an  "innocent  explanation",
    satisfying a minimum level of plausibility. The explanation provided by
    the appellant that he  sat  the  test  in  a  satellite  court  was  an
    explanation he had provided before Judge Herbert, on the first occasion
    the matter was before the First-tier Tribunal.  Having  secured  a  re-
    hearing of the case at first instance, the Secretary of State  did  not
    procure further evidence stating that no satellite courts existed.  The
    Secretary of State was on notice that that  would  be  the  appellant's
    "innocent explanation" and did not secure evidence to  rebut  it.   The
    judge below took account of the entirety of the  appellant's  evidence,
    including the travel arrangements he made to attend the college in East
    London.  The appellant had explained that he attempted  to  attend  the
    college where he sat the test, but it had closed down. That was why  he
    had not provided the voice recording.  Ultimately,  Mr  Patel  contends
    that the judge's findings were open to him on the  evidence  he  heard.
    There was no  irrationality  or  other  material  error  of  law  which
    infected the judge's findings of fact.

Legal framework

13. This is an appeal  against  an  "immigration  decision"  brought  under
    section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  in  the
    form it existed prior to being amended by the Immigration Act 2014.

14. The basis upon which the challenge was advanced before Judge Blake  was
    that the Secretary of State had erred in his application  of  paragraph
    322(2) of the Immigration Rules.   That  paragraph  provides  that  the
    following conduct amounts to a ground for refusal:

         "(2) the making of false representations or the failure to disclose
         any material fact for the purpose of obtaining leave to enter or  a
         previous variation of leave or in order to  obtain  documents  from
         the Secretary of State or a third party required in support of  the
         application for leave to enter or a previous variation of leave."

15. Where the Secretary of State alleges deception, he bears the burden  of
    proving it.  There is an evidential burden on the Secretary of State in
    the first instance; if he provides  evidence  demonstrating  there  are
    reasonable grounds to conclude that the appellant used  deception,  the
    burden shifts onto  the  appellant  to  provide  a  plausible  innocent
    explanation.  If the appellant does so, the burden "shifts back" to the
    Secretary of State to demonstrate how, in light  of  that  explanation,
    the  allegation  of  deception  is  made  out,  to   the   balance   of
    probabilities standard.   Such an assessment is  always  an  inherently
    fact-sensitive task, even in cases where  the  evidence  may  otherwise
    seem incontrovertible.  See [33] of Ahsan:

         "Where the impugned test was taken at an established fraud  factory
         such as Elizabeth College, and also where the voice-file  does  not
         record the applicant's voice (or no attempt has been made to obtain
         it), the case that he or she cheated  will  be  hard  to  resist...
         However, I am not prepared to  accept  -  and  I  do  not  in  fact
         understand Ms Giovannetti to have been contending -  that  even  in
         such specially strong cases the observations in the  earlier  case-
         law to  the  effect  that  a  decision  whether  the  applicant  or
         appellant has cheated is fact-specific are no longer applicable  or
         that there is no prospect of  their  oral  evidence  affecting  the
         outcome."

16. Paragraph  245HD  of  the  Immigration  Rules  establishes  the  highly
    prescriptive requirements of the  Points  Based  System  for  leave  to
    remain as a  Tier  2  (General)  Migrant.   Significantly  for  present
    purposes, paragraph 245HD(f) provides that an applicant must be awarded
    50 points under paragraphs 76 to  79D  of  Appendix  A  to  the  rules.
    Appendix A, paragraph  77H(a)  requires  a  job  recorded  by  the  COS
    Checking Service to be a "genuine vacancy".

Analysis

Paragraph 322(2)

17. The Secretary of State does not challenge the Judge's approach  to  the
    legal  framework  governing  establishing  allegations  of   deception,
    specifically allegations  made  in  the  context  of  impugned  English
    language tests. Rather, the main thrust of  the  Secretary  of  State's
    submissions focuses on the rationality or otherwise of  the  acceptance
    by the judge of the appellant's contention  that  he  sat  his  English
    language test at an otherwise unknown satellite court. We  accept  that
    there is a significant degree of superficial force in the  position  of
    the Secretary of State.  On the face of it, a finding that a  satellite
    college exists, in circumstances when the respondent has no  record  of
    it, and in which the appellant himself has been unable to  provide  any
    supporting evidence of its existence, may be difficult to sustain.  The
    existence of a language testing centre is  a  matter  which  one  would
    ordinarily expect there  to  be  a  wealth  of  independent  supporting
    evidence. The judge seemingly accepted the  appellant's  assertion,  in
    the absence of such evidence, that such an alternative college existed.
    On one view, such a finding could, in principle, be  capable  of  being
    categorised as perverse or irrational.

18. Properly understood, we do not consider Judge Blake to have fallen into
    error. We do not consider his findings of fact to be that there  was  a
    genuine test centre satellite college in East London. Rather, the judge
    accepted the appellant's explanation that he attended premises in  East
    London which purported to be a test centre of some form,  and  that  he
    took his test there.

19. Pausing for a moment to  examine  the  overall  case  advanced  by  the
    Secretary of State, it is plainly the case that  there  was  widespread
    fraud, corruption and other irregularities at the heart of the  English
    language testing  system  administered  by  ETS.  Project  Fa�ade,  the
    criminal investigation into Colwell  College,  revealed  that  of  2901
    tests taken between October 2011 and January 2013, over half (53%) were
    categorised as "invalid", that is 1559. 1342 tests were categorised  as
    "questionable". There were no results which  featured  no  evidence  of
    invalidity.  The report categorises the conduct at Colwell  College  as
    "organised and widespread  abuse".  Voice  analysis  demonstrated  that
    cheating at the college was widespread.  Educational  Testing  Services
    auditors were excluded from the test rooms during the  preparation  and
    identification phases of the tests.  The college  was  corrupt  to  its
    core.   See Project Fa�ade - criminal inquiry into  the  abuse  of  the
    TOEIC, provided by the Secretary of State, dated 15 May 2015.

20. Against that background of widespread fraud and abuse, we consider that
    it is entirely plausible that the college could  have  facilitated  the
    establishment of "pop-up" colleges in other parts  of  the  country  by
    other  corrupt  individuals.  Bearing  in  mind  the  corruption  which
    characterised so much of what took place at the college, it is entirely
    plausible that the appellant did in  fact  attend  something  which  he
    thought was a genuine test centre, but in fact was  not.  It  does  not
    matter whether the satellite test centre was  genuine  or  not.  Again,
    given the widespread fraud and abuse, it  is  entirely  plausible  that
    Colwell College permitted such satellite test centres to run fictitious
    results through its own books as part of a "package" made available  to
    those seeking English language certificates.

21. We do not consider Judge Blake's findings to have been premised on  the
    erroneous assumption that a fictitious college  did,  in  fact,  exist.
    Rather, the judge correctly analysed the appellant's evidence  that  he
    attended a test centre, took a test, and was issued with a  certificate
    from a centre which the respondent has now discovered  to  be  a  fraud
    factory.  The "college" was no longer there, and the appellant had  not
    been able to obtain a copy of the recording from it.

22. In our view, this was an "innocent  explanation"  that  the  judge  was
    entitled to accept.

23. The judge reached those findings in light of the appellant's "very good
    command" of English, as demonstrated  during  his  oral  evidence  (see
    [66]). The judge  also  noted  the  qualifications  the  appellant  had
    already obtained prior to taking his test. At  [68],  the  judge  noted
    that the appellant's application which relied upon the impugned English
    language certificate had been submitted at a time  when  the  appellant
    still had a long period of time until the expiry  of  his  then  extant
    visa. These were factors that the  judge  was  entitled  to  take  into
    account.  Of course, those who cheat in English language tests may have
    a variety of motives for doing so, even if they would, in principle, be
    able to take the test themselves. However,  the  judge  considered  the
    entirety of the evidence, in the round, approaching the  core  elements
    of the appellant's case on a basis which we find to be sustainable.

24. If, as is the Secretary of  State's  general  case  in  these  matters,
    Colwell College was characterised by corruption  to  its  core,  it  is
    entirely consistent with the case advanced  by  the  appellant  that  a
    proxy could have been used on his behalf by the  college,  without  his
    knowledge, even if he took a test of sorts elsewhere.

25. It may well be that other judges would not have adopted such a generous
    approach towards the appellant - but that is not the threshold for this
    tribunal to  interfere  with  his  findings.  Despite  the  superficial
    attractiveness of the Secretary  of  State's  submissions,  we  do  not
    consider  this  judged  to  have  acted  perversely,  irrationally   or
    otherwise unlawfully when reaching his findings of fact.

26. For those reasons, we do not consider the  judge  to  have  erred  when
    accepting  the  appellant's  evidence  that  he   did   not   knowingly
    participate in the fraud against the  respondent.   The  appellant  had
    provided a so-called "innocent explanation", which had  the  effect  of
    swinging the evidential burden pendulum back to the Secretary of State.
    The Secretary of State, despite being  on  notice  that  this  was  the
    appellant's likely evidence, had not provided any  evidence  to  refute
    that  assertion,  other  than  highlighting  the  absence  of  evidence
    (something which the judge had already rejected, by virtue of accepting
    this strand of the appellant's case). As  such,  we  agree  with  Judge
    Blake that the Secretary of State has  not  discharged  the  burden  of
    demonstrating that the  appellant  made  false  representations.   This
    ground of appeal is dismissed.

Certificate of Sponsorship

27. In relation to  the  COS,  we  accept  that  the  judge  erred  by  not
    considering it.  However, we do not consider  this  to  be  a  material
    error, due to the inadequacy of reasoning in the refusal letter.

28. The letter states that the  COS  provided  by  the  appellant  did  not
    demonstrate that the appellant's proposed role  related  to  a  genuine
    vacancy.  We pressed the presenting officer at the hearing  as  to  how
    this deficiency manifested itself; the refusal  letter  suggested  that
    the COS itself was deficient.  The presenting officer accepted  that  a
    COS does not contain  details  which  pertain  to  the  genuineness  or
    otherwise of the proposed occupation.  The  refusal  letter  relied  on
    paragraph 77H of Appendix FM which clearly requires  the  Secretary  of
    State to have reasonable grounds to  believe  that  a  vacancy  is  not
    genuine,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the  remaining   evidential
    requirements of the application were met.

29. The requirement in paragraph 77H is for the Secretary of State to  have
    "reasonable grounds to  believe"  that  the  vacancy  is  not  genuine.
    Nowhere in the refusal letter does the Secretary of State specify  what
    those reasonable grounds are.  The onus in  paragraph  77H  is  on  the
    Secretary of State to provide reasonable grounds, to which an applicant
    may be expected to respond.  By contrast, the  approach  taken  by  the
    Secretary of State in the present matter suggests that he expected  the
    appellant to demonstrate why the vacancy was  genuine,  despite  having
    met all other criteria.  So much is clear from the letter itself: "Your
    [COS] does not provide sufficient information to show that your job  is
    a genuine vacancy..."  No reference is made to the required "reasonable
    grounds" the Secretary of State must have under the rules to reach that
    conclusion.

30. We consider the Secretary of State to have  misapplied  paragraph  77H.
    Rather than the Secretary of State providing the grounds to  call  into
    question the genuineness of the certificate,  the  Secretary  of  State
    reversed the burden of proof and imposed a requirement on the appellant
    to demonstrate that the certificate was  genuine,  in  the  absence  of
    reasonable grounds to demonstrate otherwise.  Moreover, there is not  a
    shred of evidence in the refusal letter demonstrating how the Secretary
    of State reached that conclusion.  Indeed, the letter states  that  the
    Secretary of State has deliberately not sought  additional  information
    from the appellant, as the  application  was  being  refused  on  other
    grounds.

31. The operative reason given by the refusal letter for awarding no points
    under  this  heading  related  to  the  deficiencies  of  the  COS.  As
    demonstrated  above,  that  document  featured  no  deficiencies  which
    merited that conclusion. Rather, the Secretary of  State  had  concerns
    about the application which were not set out in the refusal letter, nor
    were they expressed in accordance with the process established  by  the
    Immigration Rules in order to deal with precisely this issue.

32. In our  view,  that  is  not  a  sustainable  conclusion.  It  follows,
    therefore, that Judge Blake's failure to deal with the  COS  issue  was
    not material  to  the  outcome  of  the  appeal.  There  was  only  one
    conclusion which the judge could have reached, had  he  addressed  that
    issue,  namely  that  the  respondent  Secretary  of  State   had   not
    demonstrated that the appellant's proposed employment was not genuine.

Conclusion

33. For the reasons given  above,  we  dismiss  the  Secretary  of  State's
    appeal.



Notice of Decision

This appeal is dismissed under  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  decision  of
Judge Blake is upheld.
