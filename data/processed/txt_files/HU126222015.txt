For the Respondent:    Mr A Tan         (Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    This is the claimant's appeal to  the  Upper Tribunal,  brought  with
permission, from a decision of the First-tier Tribunal (the tribunal) which
it sent to the parties on 26 June 2017; whereupon it dismissed his  appeal
from a decision of an entry clearance officer refusing to  grant  him  entry
clearance to come to the United Kingdom (UK) with a view to  settlement  as
the intended future husband of his UK based female sponsor.

2.     In  a  decision  of  28 November 2018,  following  a  hearing  of
16 November 2018, I set aside the tribunal's decision and I directed  that
there be a further hearing before the Upper Tribunal so that  the  decision
could be remade in this forum.  I have now remade  that  decision  and  what
follows constitutes an explanation as to how I have done so.

3.    The claimant, who was born  on  7 January 1976,  is  a  national  of
Pakistan.  His sponsor, one [RB], is  a  female  British  national  and  she
resides permanently in the  UK.   She  has  been  married  before  but  that
marriage ended in divorce.  She entered into a religious marriage  with  the
claimant whilst she was spending time  in  Pakistan.   However,  since  that
marriage took place prior to her divorce being finalised in accordance  with
UK legal requirements, UK law does not recognise  her  as  being  a  legally
married person.  There has  never  been  any  issue  about  that.   But  the
parties wished to live together in the UK and so the  claimant  applied  for
entry clearance.  In so doing, both of them  said  the  intention  was  that
they would marry lawfully in the UK and that the claimant would then  reside
in the UK with the sponsor.

4.    The application for entry clearance was not  successful.   Indeed,  it
was refused by an entry clearance officer on 4 December 2015.  There were a
number of reasons why the entry clearance officer refused  the  application.
First of all, he was not satisfied that the claimant was  genuinely  seeking
entry to the UK to enable a marriage  to  take  place.   That  was  for  the
stated reason that there was no evidence that a  wedding  had  been  booked.
Secondly, the entry clearance officer thought that the claimant  had  failed
to  demonstrate  that   his   sponsor   had   a   gross   income,   as   the
Immigration Rules require, of at least ï¿½18,600.00 per annum.  Thirdly,  the
entry clearance officer thought that, irrespective of  whether  the  minimum
income threshold had been  reached  or  not,  the  claimant  had  failed  to
provide certain specified evidence as contained in  Appendix FM-SE  to  the
Immigration Rules.  It is notable that the claimant had failed to provide a
letter from his sponsor's employer confirming her employment as well as,  it
was said, various other documents relating (it seems) to the sponsor's self-
employment.  Pausing there, reliance  was  being  placed  upon  income  from
employment and also income  from  self-employment  on  the  basis  that  the
sponsor runs her own small catering business.

5.    The claimant appealed to  the  First-tier Tribunal  which,  as  noted
above, dismissed his appeal.  But as I say, that decision has now  been  set
aside.  Before me, for the purposes of the remaking of the decision, it  was
accepted on behalf of the claimant that  he  could  not  succeed  under  the
Immigration Rules.  That was conceded, though, only on the basis that there
had been a failure to supply a letter from the employer.  It  was  contended
that  actually   or   in   substance   all   other   requirements   of   the
Immigration Rules had been met so that the appeal ought  to  succeed  under
Article 8 under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

6.    I had before me, for the purposes of the  remaking  of  the  decision,
documentation provided by both  parties.   I  have  taken  all  of  it  into
account but I have only made  specific  reference  to  specific  documentary
items where I have found it necessary to  do  so  in  order  to  explain  my
decision.  I heard oral evidence from the sponsor and oral submissions  from
each representative.  But, again, I have only  referred  to  what  was  said
where doing so is necessary  or  otherwise  required  in  order  for  me  to
explain my decision.

7.    Technically, the question of the claimant's  intentions  (that  is  to
say whether he is genuinely seeking entry clearance for  the  purpose  of  a
marriage) is before me.  However, the contention that there is no  intention
to marry simply because no wedding has  been  booked  is,  in  my  judgment,
entirely unsustainable.  Obviously, a  booking  without  a  grant  of  entry
clearance and a projected  date  for  entry  would  be  entirely  premature.
Mr Tan did not seek to argue the point, to any  extent  whatsoever,  before
me.  Accordingly, whilst it is accepted that  the  claimant  cannot  succeed
under the Immigration Rules in any event, I conclude that he  does  satisfy
the relevant part of the Rules relating to an intention to marry in the UK.

8.    There is then the question of the lack of a letter from the  sponsor's
employer.  The sponsor's position as to that has been consistent.  She  says
that her employer will simply not provide such letters either to her  or  to
anyone else.  She says she  has  asked  for  such  a  letter  but  has  been
rebuffed.  It is said that  she  even  asked  her  employer  to  attend  the
hearing before the tribunal but  that  that  employer  declined  to  do  so.
There is before me, somewhat ironically perhaps, a  letter  written  by  the
employer confirming that employer's unpreparedness  to  supply  the  sponsor
with a letter confirming the fact of her  employment.   It  is  asserted  in
that letter that there will be a range  of  other  documentation  (which  of
course is true in the case of genuine employment) to prove the existence  of
that employment.  The letter is dated  14 November 2018  so  was  prepared
relatively recently.  It demonstrates no change of mind from  the  situation
as it was said to have been when the entry clearance  application  was  made
and when the appeal was initially heard by the tribunal.  There is,  indeed,
other documentation before me which does evidence the sponsor's  employment.
 There are bank statements  showing  her  wage  being  paid  into  her  bank
account on a regular basis.  There are P60 forms for 2017 and 2018.   There
are wage slips.  Indeed, Mr Tan does not seek to argue that the sponsor  is
not employed.  The sponsor told me that her employers "still  won't  provide
letters".   Since  that  part  of  her  oral  evidence  is  corroborated  by
documentary evidence emanating from the employer I accept what she says.   I
find, therefore, that she  is  employed  by  Spring Mount  Specialist  Care
Home Ltd and has been  so  employed  throughout  the  period  spanning  the
application for entry clearance and the appeal before me  for  the  purposes
of the remaking of the decision.  I also find that  her  employer  genuinely
refuses to supply a letter confirming her  employment  for  entry  clearance
purposes, that she has tried to persuade her employer to  do  so  and  that,
being realistic, there is really no more that she can do.

9.    There was an issue of dispute as to whether or not the  various  other
documents  required  under  Appendix FM/SE  had  been  supplied  with  the
application for entry clearance.  Essentially, the entry  clearance  officer
says that such documents were not provided  but  the  sponsor  and  claimant
assert that they were.  Although this perhaps once loomed large as an  issue
I have decided, given that I am now called  upon  to  decide  an  Article 8
appeal on the basis of circumstances as they stood as  at  25 January 2019
(the date of the remaking hearing) it is not of  real  significance  whether
on a date in 2015 prescribed documentation had or  had  not  been  supplied.
In any event it is really very difficult to decide the issue now.   Sponsors
and  applicants  are  capable  of  failing  to  meet  the   quite   exacting
requirements with respect to specific documents.  But  there  will  also  be
times when documents go astray or  might  be  overlooked  by  a  busy  entry
clearance officer.

10.   There are really two key issues which, in fact, I have  to  decide  in
order to resolve this appeal.  The first is whether  or  not  Article 8  is
engaged.  If it is, the second issue is whether, in all  the  circumstances,
it would be disproportionate to  reach  a  decision  having  the  effect  of
excluding the claimant from coming to the  UK  at  least  until  any  future
application for entry clearance which might be made, will succeed.

11.   As to whether Article 8 is engaged at all,  that  is,  of  course,  a
consideration which is necessary when following the fivefold  test  set  out
in the well-known case of Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27.  The  argument  for  the
Secretary of State is to the effect that there is no  interference  of  such
gravity as to potentially engage Article 8 because if the  claimant  cannot
come to live in the UK the sponsor can go to live with him in Pakistan.   If
that happens, runs the argument, family life can continue there.

12.   The sponsor, perhaps rather surprisingly, was  not  asked  any  direct
questions as to whether she would be able to join the claimant  in  Pakistan
when  she  gave  evidence  before   me.    In   a   witness   statement   of
19 January 2019, she said a little about that.  She acknowledged that  she
has extended family in Pakistan but said that she has no meaningful  contact
with them.  She asserted that she would not be able to work in Pakistan  and
that she will find it hard to adjust having been self-sufficient in the  UK.
 She says that she  has  family  and  friends  in  the  UK.   In  a  witness
statement prepared on 12 June 2017 she indicated that she has lived in the
UK since 1997 and that her family members including her mother  are  located
in the UK.  She adds "we  all  live  together".   She  then  refers  to  her
employment and to her business in the UK.

13.   It is, I think, a little disappointing that the sponsor's ties to  the
UK were not addressed in more detail.  More detail would have helped. But  I
must do my best with the evidence I have.

14.   It was said by the  Court  of  Appeal  in  AG (Eritrea)  [2007]  EWCA
Civ 801, that the threshold of engagement with respect to Article 8 "is not
a specially high one".  It is worth noting that there  has  been  more  than
one decision issued by the Upper Tribunal in which it has been decided,  on
the basis of specific facts, that Article 8 was engaged even in the context
of cases involving the refusal of a visit visa.  One such case,  by  way  of
example, is Mostafa (Article 8 in Entry Clearance) [2015] UKUT  112  (IAC).
But nevertheless, it will not automatically be the case that  Article 8  is
engaged in circumstances where a married couple or  a  couple  intending  to
marry are separated in consequence of a refusal of entry  clearance.   There
will, in my view, be circumstances where a UK based  sponsor  can  and  will
reasonably be expected to relocate to Pakistan and,  if  that  can  be  done
without undue hardship, then  it  is  really  quite  difficult  to  see  how
Article 8 will be engaged.  There is often an assumption that it is engaged
in these sorts of cases but such a routine  assumption  if  made  without  a
consideration of the specific facts might be a complacent one.

15.   As to the circumstances of this particular case, what the sponsor  has
had to say about her ties to the UK, albeit not in  great  detail,  has  not
been the subject of any specific challenge.  I  accept  that,  although  not
born in the UK, she has resided here since 1987.   I  accept  that  she  has
close family members in the UK.  I accept that she is used  to  working  and
that, additionally, she does have her own small business in  the  UK,  which
gives her a level of independence which she may not have  in  Pakistan.   As
to that, no background country material regarding the position of  women  in
current day Pakistan has been  provided.   But  I  think  it  reasonable  to
conclude that if she is to relocate there it is unlikely she  will  be  able
to work because of  different  societal  expectations  to  those  prevailing
within the UK.  In all the circumstances I would conclude that Article 8 is
engaged in this case.

16.   There is no doubt that any  interference  with  Article 8  rights  is
lawful and is, speaking generally, in pursuance of a legitimate  aim.   That
then brings us to the question of proportionality.

17.   Evidence has  been  provided  concerning  the  sponsor's  current  and
historical financial situation.  In particular,  accounts  which  appear  to
have been properly prepared by a firm of accountants, and  which  relate  to
her catering business, have  been  provided.   Those  demonstrate  that  her
business  made  a  gross  profit  of  ï¿½3,651.00  in  the  tax  year   ending
5 April 2016 and a gross profit of  ï¿½2,294.00  for  the  tax  year  ending
5 April 2017.  Her earnings from employed income for the tax  year  ending
5 April 2017 amounted to ï¿½17,544.61 so that placed her, for that year, over
the minimum income threshold of ï¿½8,600.00 with a little to  spare.   But  no
accounts have been provided for a later period than that.

18.   The documentation does indicate  that  the  earnings  from  employment
remain at a similar level.   I  have  not  been  provided  with  a  schedule
concerning the earnings for the  period  leading  up  to  the  date  of  the
remaking hearing with respect to self-employment.  That would  have  helped.
As it is, in order to look at what the last 12 months might tell us, I have
calculated, from the  sponsor's  bank  statements,  that  she  has  received
credits to her bank account, which might  relate  to  her  business  income,
amounting to some ï¿½1,800.00.  The sponsor said, in oral evidence, that  such
entries did relate to her self-employed earnings.  I  was  not  specifically
invited to disbelieve her about that.  I would accept  Mr Tan's  submission
to the effect  that  she  appeared  to  be  quite  vague  in  oral  evidence
regarding her self-employed earnings  but  vagueness  does  not  necessarily
lead to a conclusion that the person who has been vague has  been  dishonest
or evasive.  There is no  suggestion  that  she  has  any  other  source  of
income.  I have concluded that I am able to accept that for  the  past  year
or so she has  earned  some  ï¿½1,800.00.   That  suggests  that  her  overall
earnings do remain above the minimum income threshold.

19.   I have considered whether the claimant should be expected  to  make  a
fresh application for entry clearance.  Mr Tan suggests that,  in  fact,  I
should so conclude.  He alludes to the possibility that a  letter  might  be
supplied by the  sponsor's  employer  in  the  future  particularly  if  her
solicitors make a direct request.  But it seems to me that, on  that  issue,
the employers have nailed their colours firmly to the mast.  There has  been
a consistent refusal to supply such a letter and an indication that  because
of previous concerns (unspecified) when such letters have been issued,  they
are no longer prepared to issue them.  It does seem to me,  therefore,  that
if a fresh application  for  entry  clearance  were  to  be  made  it  would
probably fail on the basis  that  not  all  of  the  documents  required  by
Appendix FM/SE can be provided.

20.   I do regard the failure to provide a letter confirming  employment  as
an exceptional circumstance.  It seems  to  me  to  be  highly  unusual.   I
cannot recall ever coming across it before.  The view might  be  taken  that
it is so unusual that it was not thought necessary for provision to be  made
for it in the Immigration Rules.

21.   Putting together my conclusion that the income threshold is  surpassed
and has been so, I find, throughout the period  spanning  the  time  of  the
entry clearance application through to the remaking hearing before  me,  and
the inability through no fault of the claimant or  sponsor  to  comply  with
the Immigration Rules unless the sponsor were to, for that  reason,  change
job, then I would conclude that this case, on its particular facts,  is  one
where Article 8 demands that the appeal be allowed.  In  other  words,  the
interference that there is with Article 8 rights is disproportionate.

22.   So, in remaking the decision, I have decided to allow  the  claimant's
appeal against the  entry  clearance  officer's  decision  to  refuse  entry
clearance.

23.   Finally, I have not made any anonymity  direction.   None  was  sought
before me and I cannot think of a good reason to grant anonymity.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained errors  of  law  and  has
already been set aside.

In remaking  the  decision,  I  allow  the  claimant's  appeal  against  the
decision of  the  entry  clearance  officer  refusing  to  grant  him  entry
clearance to come to the UK with a view to settlement on the  basis  of  his
relationship with his sponsor.

I make no anonymity direction for the reasons set out above.
