                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellants

 1. The Appellants are husband and wife born on 5 January 1968 and  1  June
    1972.  They are both citizens  of  India.   On  26  January  2010  they
    arrived in the United Kingdom, the husband  with  leave  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student Migrant and the wife as his dependant.

 2. On 27 February 2012,  before  expiry  of  their  previous  leave,  they
    applied for further leave in the same capacities.

 3. On 19 April 2013  the  Respondent  refused  the  husband's  application
    because she found he did not meet the English language requirements  of
    paragraph 245ZX(c) and  paragraph  118(b)(ii)  of  Appendix  A  to  the
    Immigration Rules.  The wife's application as his dependant was refused
    in line with that of  her  husband.  Additionally,  the  Respondent  in
    decided to remove the Appellants  to  India  by  way  directions  under
    section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

The First-tier Tribunal's Determination

 4. By a determination promulgated on 24 January 2014 Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Graham found that the husband had not complied  with  the
    English language requirements of the Rules because  he  had  failed  to
    produce an acceptable English language test certificate showing he  had
    obtained minimum scores for each of the  reading,  listening,  speaking
    and writing components of the test on the same date.  The wife's appeal
    as his dependant failed in line with that of her husband.

 5. On 11 February 2014 Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Heynes  refused
    permission to appeal. The Appellants renewed their application and on 7
    April 2014 Upper Tribunal Judge Macleman found there  was  an  arguable
    error of law in the First-tier Tribunal's determination because at  the
    date of the decision the Immigration Rules  had  not  been  amended  to
    provide that the certificate evidencing scores at or above the  minimum
    levels in the English language test should all be obtained or issued on
    the same date.  He noted that such a provision came  into  force  on  1
    October 2013.

Upper Tribunal Proceedings

 6. On 28 April 2014 the Respondent wrote to  the  Upper  Tribunal  stating
    that  the  matter  had  been  referred  to  "Tier  4  Operations"   for
    reconsideration and that "it would seem likely that  the  matter  could
    now be resolved in the Appellants' favour".  The Tribunal file contains
    no evidence of any further development and on  22  October  2014  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Coker directed the appeal be  listed  for  hearing.   It
    came before me on 18 December 2014.

 7. Neither of the Appellants were present nor any representative for them.
     No message had been  left  at  the  Field  House  reception  desk  and
    searches of the waiting areas did not disclose the  Appellants  or  any
    representative for them.  I was satisfied that notice of the time, date
    and place set for the hearing had been properly given to the Appellants
    and their solicitors and having read the papers in  the  Tribunal  file
    and considered the likely issues that it was just  to  proceed  in  the
    absence of the Appellants or any representative for  them.   Subsequent
    to the hearing I was handed a letter from  the  Appellants'  solicitors
    received on the day of  the  hearing  mentioning  to  the  Respondent's
    agreement to reconsider the application in the Appellants' favour.  The
    letter referred to the financial circumstances of  the  Appellants  and
    requested the matter proceed in the absence of the Appellants and their
    solicitors.

 8. For the Respondent Mr Avery submitted  the  issue  was  what  were  the
    requirements of the relevant Immigration  Rules  at  the  date  of  the
    Respondent's decision.  If I found the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
    had referred to the incorrect version of the Rules it would be open  to
    me to remit the matter to the Respondent or for me to decide the  issue
    with which the Respondent would be content.  He drew  my  attention  to
    the husband's application in which he had stated the course  for  which
    leave to remain was required ended on 12 December 2014.

Error of Law Consideration

 9. I find  that  the  relevant  Immigration  Rules  did  not  require  the
    certificates evidencing an applicant's facility in English language  to
    have been issued  on  the  same  date.   The  Tribunal  file  contained
    certificates for speaking issued on 17 January 2012, for listening  and
    reading issued on 15 November 2011 and for speaking and writing  issued
    on 16 November 2011.  All three certificates remained valid at the date
    of the application and indeed at the date of the hearing before me. The
    latter two certificates are the ones  most  relevant  to  this  appeal.
    There was no challenge to them.  I am satisfied that there is an  error
    of law in the First-tier Tribunal's determination such that  it  should
    be set aside and that it  was  appropriate  for  me  to  proceed  to  a
    consideration of the substantive appeal.

Substantive Disposal

10. For the reasons given in the preceding paragraph the  English  language
    certificates supplied  by  the  Appellant  husband  to  the  Respondent
    complied with the requirements of the Rules in force at the date of the
    decision. The husband's facility  in  English  language  was  the  sole
    reason for the refusal and therefore his appeal is allowed and that  of
    his wife as his dependant.

11. The Respondent will need to take into account that the husband's course
    of study for which he had originally applied for leave had come  to  an
    end only a few days before the hearing in the Upper Tribunal.  This may
    have an impact on any length of leave which might  be  granted  to  the
    Appellants.

Anonymity

12. There was no request for an anonymity order and having  considered  the
    papers in the Tribunal file and  heard  the  appeal  consider  none  is
    warranted.

DECISION

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and
is set aside.  The following decision is substituted:-




    The appeals of the husband and wife are allowed on immigration grounds.

    Anonymity order not made.

TO THE RESPONDENT: FEE AWARD

These appeals have been allowed and having  regard  to  the  fact  that  the
Respondent's decision to refuse the applications was made  by  reference  to
the wrong set of Immigration Rules, I make a whole  fee  award  of  ï¿½140  to
each of the Appellants.
