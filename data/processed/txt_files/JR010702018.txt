                                              Before  Upper  Tribunal  Judge

Application for judicial review


Having considered all documents lodged and the Applicant  being  represented
by Mr. J. Gajjar, Direct Access  Counsel,  and  Mr.  Z.  Malik  of  Counsel,
appearing on behalf of the Respondent, instructed by  the  Government  Legal
Department, at a hearing at Field House, London on 25 January 2019.

Decision: the application is refused

(1)   The Applicant is  a  national  of  Pakistan.  He  entered  the  United
      Kingdom, as a student, on 8 October 2008 and his leave was extended in
      this capacity until 30 August 2010. Then, on 27 August  2010,  he  was
      granted leave to remain as a Tier 1  (Post  Study)  Migrant  until  27
      August 2012 and as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant until 3 June 2013.  This
      leave was subsequently extended until  13  June  2016.  The  Applicant
      applied for indefinite leave to remain as a Tier 1  (General)  Migrant
      on 8 June 2016 and the Respondent asked the Applicant  to  complete  a
      questionnaire on 16 March 2017. He returned this questionnaire  on  12
      April 2017 and his application was refused on 9 November 2017.

(2)   On 18 December 2017, the  Respondent  maintained  his  decision  after
      conducting an administrative review. Prestige  Solicitors  lodged  the
      Applicant's claim for judicial review against the latter decision on 9
      February 2018 and the Respondent filed his acknowledgment  of  service
      and summary grounds of defence on 9 March 2018. Upper  Tribunal  Judge
      Coker refused him permission on the papers on  7  June  2018  and  the
      Applicant applied to renew his claim on 21 June 2018.  The  claim  was
      then listed before HHJ Graham Wood  QC  on  6  August  2018  but  this
      hearing  was  adjourned,  as  the  Respondent  had  not  received  the
      supplementary grounds of claim which the Applicant had submitted on  4
      June 2018 or the Applicant's revised  bundle,  which  had  been  filed
      after transferring his instructions to Farani Taylor  Solicitors.  HHJ
      Graham Wood QC also gave the  Applicant  permission  to  rely  on  his
      supplementary grounds of claim and the Respondent was given permission
      to file and serve amended summary grounds of defence.

(3)   The Respondent  filed  and  served  his  amended  summary  grounds  of
      defence on 3 September 2018. Upper Tribunal Judge  King  then  granted
      the Applicant permission at an oral hearing on 16 October 2018 on  two
      of the three supplementary grounds of claim.

(4)   The Respondent filed his detailed grounds of defence  on  28  November
      2018 and the Applicant lodged his skeleton argument and a  substantive
      bundle on 9 January 2019. This appears to have been  within  the  time
      scales directed by Upper Tribunal Judge King.  In a letter,  dated  16
      January 2019, the  Respondent  said  that  he  had  not  received  the
      Applicant's skeleton argument and intended to  rely  on  his  detailed
      grounds of defence but her subsequently file a skeleton argument on 22
      January 2019.  The Applicant's  solicitors  also  filed  a  bundle  of
      authorities on 22 January 2019.

THE HEARING

(5)   At the start of the hearing, counsel for  the  Applicant  informed  me
      that the Applicant no longer relied on his second supplementary ground
      of claim, which had asserted that the  Respondent's  consideration  of
      his application was unreasonable, irrational and unlawful and was  one
      which breached the common law principle of procedural fairness. It was
      not strictly necessary for him to do so as Upper Tribunal  Judge  King
      had stated  in  his  decision  that  he  found  little  merit  in  the
      submission made on behalf of the Applicant that the process adopted by
      the  Respondent  was  unfair  as  the  Applicant  was   given   little
      opportunity to explain the discrepancy between the amount of  earnings
      declared to HMRC for the tax year 2010/2011 and the level of  earnings
      he relied upon when he applied for further leave to remain on 2  April
      2011. In particular, Upper Tribunal Judge King went on  to  state:  "I
      find that the applicant had been given a fair opportunity to  give  an
      explanation as to the discrepancy in accounting. The respondent has as
      I so find properly engaged with the explanation that had been offered.
      I find that it is reasonably open to the Secretary of State to come to
      the view that no good explanation had been offered to explain  such  a
      discrepancy".

(6)    Both  counsel  made  oral  submissions  on  the   first   and   third
      supplementary grounds of claim and I have taken these submissions into
      account when reaching my decision below.

MERITS OF THE CLAIM

(7)   The supplementary grounds of claim challenge both  the  decision  made
    on 9 November 2017 and the later decision made  on  18  December  2017.
    This  was  a  sensible  approach  as  the  decision  taken   after   an
    administrative review  implicitly  reflected  the  decision  to  refuse
    leave.

(8)   In relation to the third ground,  paragraph  322  of  the  Immigration
    Rules states that:

         "In addition to the grounds for refusal of extension  of  stay  set
         out in Parts 2 - 8 of these Rules, the following  provisions  apply
         in relation to the refusal of an application for leave to remain...


         Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave to enter or
         remain in the United Kingdom should normally be refused


         (5)  the undesirability  of  permitting  the  person  concerned  to
         remain in the United Kingdom in the light of his conduct (including
         convictions which do not fall within paragraph 322 (1C)), character
         or associations or the fact that he represents a threat to national
         security".

(9)   Therefore, the Respondent had a  discretionary  power  to  refuse  the
    Applicant indefinite leave to remain if he considered that it was right
    to do so on grounds related to his character. At page 4 of the  refusal
    letter, dated 9 November 2017, the Respondent stated:

         "we  are  satisfied  that,  based  on  your  actions  in  declaring
         different amounts of income to  HMRC  and  UKVI,  you  have  either
         misrepresented your earnings to HMRC in order to  reduce  your  tax
         liability or provided false information about your earnings to UKVI
         in order to obtain leave to remain, or both".

(10)  The Respondent also stated that "your actions in  declaring  different
    amounts of income to HMRC and UKVI lead to the conclusion that in light
    of your character and conduct it would be undesirable to allow  you  to
    remain in the United Kingdom". Earlier in the decision  the  Respondent
    had noted  that  the  Applicant  had  stated  in  his  answers  to  the
    questionnaire sent to him by the Respondent that  the  discrepancy  had
    arisen because of an error or oversight made by his accountant but  the
    Respondent had stated that he did not accept that this was the case.

(11)  The Respondent then went on to state:

         "Having decided to work as self-employed in the United  Kingdom  it
         is  your  responsibility  to  ensure  the  correct  declaration  of
         earnings are made to HMRC at the correct time, whether prepared  by
         yourself or a third party. The onus is on you to  ensure  that  the
         correct figures are submitted initially. It is not credible that  a
         competent professional accountant would  make  such  a  fundamental
         mistake in miss-declaring taxes to HMRC, and it is not credible you
         would not realise an error had been made until over 4  years  after
         the original tax return was due. You  have  the  responsibility  to
         maintain accurate records of your finances and tax liabilities".

(12)  The Applicant's  counsel  relied  on  the  reported  decision  of  the
    Honourable Mr. Justice Martin Spencer, R (on the application of Khan) v
    Secretary of State for the Home  Department  (Dishonesty,  tax  return,
    paragraph 322(5) [2018] UKUT 00384  (IAC).  At  paragraph  37  of  that
    decision Mr. Justice Spencer gave guidance in cases with  the  same  or
    similar factual matrix as the present claim. In  sub-paragraph  (i)  he
    stated that:

         "Where there has been significant  difference  between  the  income
         claimed in a previous application  for  leave  to  remain  and  the
         income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of State is entitled to draw
         an inference that the Applicant had been deceitful or dishonest and
         therefore he should be refused ILR within paragraph 322(5)  of  the
         Immigration Rules".

 (13) In the current claim the discrepancy was in the  sum  of  �37,594,  as
    when the Applicant previously applied for leave as a Tier  1  (General)
    Migrant on 2 April 2011, he said that his income from profit from self-
    employment was �51,411 but, when he declared his income to HMRC for the
    year 2010/2011.  he  only  showed  a  profit  from  self-employment  of
    �13,817. Therefore, it was not unreasonable for the Respondent to infer
    that the Applicant had been deceitful or dishonest. Mr. Justice Spencer
    went on to state in sub-paragraph (ii) that if the Applicant  presented
    evidence to show that, despite the prima facie inference, he was not in
    fact dishonest but only careless, then the Secretary of  State  had  to
    conduct a fact-finding exercise.

(14)   In  the  current  claim,  the  Applicant  had  sought  to  blame  his
    solicitors for an error or oversight when drawing up  his  tax  returns
    and to distance himself from the error.  This  triggered  sub-paragraph
    (iv) of Mr. Justice Spencer's guidance which stated that:

         "However, for an applicant simply to blame his  or  her  accountant
         for an "error" in relation to the historical tax return will not be
         the end of the matter: far from it. Thus, the Secretary of State is
         entitled to take into account that, even where  an  accountant  had
         made an error, the accountant will or should  have  asked  the  tax
         payer to confirm that the return was accurate and  to  have  signed
         the tax return, and furthermore the Applicant will  have  known  of
         his or her earnings and will have expected to pay tax thereon".

(15)  The Respondent took this factor into account  in  his  refusal  letter
    and when Upper Tribunal Judge King refused the Applicant permission  he
    found that the Applicant had not provided a good explanation as to  how
    the discrepancy occurred.

(16)  It is also clear from the evidence in  the  current  claim,  that  the
    Applicant had signed accounts for Swissna Enterprises for the period  1
    September 2010 to 24 March 2011 on 31 March 2011. He signed  and  dated
    each page of these accounts and on page 4 of the accounts a net  profit
    of �52,411 is recorded. It is true that these  accounts  were  not  the
    ones drawn up by Mohammad Shah &  Co  but  had  been  drawn  up  by  RR
    Accounting Solutions Ltd in connection with the Applicant's application
    for further leave to remain. However, no explanation was  given  as  to
    how the Applicant could sign and approve these accounts, which showed a
    net profit of �52,411, on 31 March 2011 and  yet  also  approve  a  tax
    return for tax year  2010/2011  which  only  showed  a  net  profit  of
    �13,594.

(17)  In addition, in his reply to question  14  of  his  questionnaire  the
      Applicant asserted that the error had occurred because his accountants
      had placed sums relating to profits in a box reserved for expenses. No
      copy of this initial return or any letter from Mohammad Shah & Co  has
      been disclosed but I note that in the letter from Kingswood  Chartered
      Certified Accountants, dated 8 December 2015, they  stated  that  they
      had been asked to review  the  Applicant's  historic  self-assessments
      submitted by his previous accountant. They went on to state that  they
      happened "that there  were  some  expenses  that  do  not  qualify  as
      "allowable qualifying expenses" [which]  were  also  included  in  the
      origin submissions". This was not consistent with the Applicant's  own
      evidence which stated the error occurred because the amounts  relating
      to profits were placed in boxes relating to expenses.

(18)  Counsel for the Applicant relied upon the fact that  in  sub-paragraph
    (viii) Mr. Justice Spencer went on to state that the Secretary of State
    should articulate her reasoning, setting out the matters which [he] has
    taken into account in reaching [his] decision and stating  the  reasons
    for the decision [he] has reached. Counsel for the Applicant  submitted
    that this had not happened in this claim. However, he did not  identify
    any matters which had  been  omitted  by  the  Respondent,  which  were
    directly applicable to the question of whether he had merely failed  to
    check the return being submitted by one of his two accountants.

 (19) Instead, he made the wider  submission  that  the  discrepancy,  which
    arose in 2011, should be viewed  in  the  context  of  the  Applicant's
    overall conduct whilst in the United  Kingdom.  However,  the  guidance
    provided in Shahbaz Khan concentrates on whether there is  a  plausible
    explanation for the discrepancy on which the Respondent relies. In sub-
    paragraph (vi) Mr. Justice Spencer confirmed this when he outlined  the
    type of questions which it would be legitimate for  the  Respondent  to
    consider. They included whether the explanation for the  error  by  the
    accountant  was  plausible,  whether   all   relevant   documents   and
    correspondence had been disclosed and why the Applicant had not noticed
    a large discrepancy had occurred.

(20)  Therefore, in the current claim it was relevant that in his  reply  to
    question 14 of his questionnaire the Applicant relied on the fact  that
    his accountant had made an error or oversight.   However,  no  copy  of
    this initial return or any letter from Mohammad Shah & Co about how the
    discrepancy occurred was submitted with the application for  indefinite
    leave to remain. In addition, there was a conflict of evidence  between
    the Applicant and Kingswood Chartered Certified Accountants  about  how
    any error occurred.

(21)  Counsel for the Applicant sought  to  rely  on  paragraph  32  of  the
    unreported case by Upper Tribunal Judge Canavan of  The  Queen  on  the
    application  of  Farooq  Shaik  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department JR/8324/2017. She stated that "a single  mistake  (albeit  a
    significant one) in the first tax return he was required to file  might
    be viewed in a different  light  to  a  series  of  mistakes  that  are
    corrected at a later date. The  applicant's  application  would  become
    less and less plausible it he alleged a  series  of  unlikely  mistakes
    made by his accountants".

(22)  The material facts of Shaik were somewhat different as  the  Applicant
    in that case had argued that the Respondent had incorrectly stated that
    the applicant had had to amend tax returns for two different tax years.



(23)  In addition, in paragraph 27 of  her  decision  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Canavan also found that "it was open to the respondent to conclude that
    it was unlikely that ...a significant error would go unnoticed  by  the
    applicant and his accountant for...a long  period  of  time"  [and  the
    period of time between initial submission and correction was similar to
    that in the current claim]. She also noted that "given that a person is
    responsible  for  checking  the  tax  return  before  signing  it   and
    submitting it to the HMRC it was open to  the  respondent  to  conclude
    that it was implausible that such an error would not be noticed by  the
    application or his account until 2016".

(24)  It is also significant that the basis upon which Upper Tribunal  Judge
    Canavan found that the decision in Shaik had been irrational  was  that
    the Respondent had made a mistake by finding that he had  amended  more
    than one tax return and had also failed to  consider  the  evidence  in
    sufficient detail.  In the current case there were no similar  mistakes
    or any failure to consider relevant evidence in sufficient detail.

(25)  Counsel for the Applicant submitted  that  no  pattern  of  deceit  in
    relation to his tax  returns  had  been  established  but  it  was  not
    necessary for such a pattern to be shown. The key question was  whether
    the Applicant had been able to  show  that  the  initial  inference  of
    deceit or dishonesty could be displaced.  The fact that he had paid his
    tax, corporation tax and VAT in other years was not  directly  relevant
    to this question.

(26)  Counsel for the Respondent also relied on the persuasive  decision  of
    In the petition Collins Oji and Ishoma Oji v Secretary of State for the
    Home Department [2018] CSOH 127 in paragraph  15  of  which  Lord  Tyne
    found that:

         "In Samant it was argued on behalf of the claimant  that  paragraph
         322(5) could not apply to conduct of this kind, but applied  rather
         to conduct at a higher level of seriousness  as  instanced  by  the
         reference in the guidance (above) to a threat to national security.
         This argument was rejected by Collins J at paragraph 10:


             "... [Counsel for the applicant] submits  too  that  when  one
             looks at the terms of 322(5) and the guidance that is applied,
             the conduct relied on must be at a  high  level  in  order  to
             justify a finding that it was non-conducive to  an  individual
             to remain. ...But if a false tax return, or indeed  any  false
             information has been given knowingly to the Secretary of State
             or to another Government body  for  any  purpose,  that  would
             suffice, but it is necessary to establish  that  it  was  done
             deliberately and was not simply a mistake or a result of  poor
             advice".

(27)  Counsel for the Applicant  also  submitted  that  the  Respondent  had
    applied the wrong burden of proof in the penultimate paragraph of  page
    4 of his initial decision when he said the "these documents  have  been
    considered by our department and it has been concluded that you do  not
    meet paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules.  I  accept  that  the
    wording used in this sentence does not accurately reflect  the  wording
    in paragraph 322. However, in my view, this is  remedied  in  the  next
    sentence which reads: "Your actions in declaring different  amounts  of
    income to HMRC and UKVI lead to the conclusion that in  light  of  your
    character and conduct it would be undesirable to allow you to remain in
    the United Kingdom". The Respondent then went on to remind himself that
    a refusal under  paragraph  322(5)  is  not  mandatory  and  a  further
    decision that it would be appropriate in the  circumstances  to  refuse
    his application.

(28)  For all of the above reasons, I find that it  was  not  irrational  or
    unlawful for the Respondent to exercise his discretion  to  refuse  the
    Applicant indefinite leave to remain  under  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

(29) For the sake of completeness, I  also  go  on  to  consider  the  first
    ground of claim  in  the  alternative,  although  it  is  not  strictly
    necessary to do so  and  any  decision  on  this  ground  is  academic.
    Paragraph 245CD of the Immigration Rules states that:

         "To qualify for indefinite leave to  remain,  a  Tier  1  (General)
         Migrant must meet the requirements listed below. If  the  applicant
         meets these  requirements,  indefinite  leave  to  remain  will  be
         granted. If the application does not meet these  requirements,  the
         application will be refused.


         ...


         (g)      in all cases other than those referred to in (e )  or  (f)
         above, the applicant must have 80 points under paragraphs 7  to  34
         of Appendix A".

 (30) Paragraph 19 (i)-(j) of Appendix A states that:

         "(i)     The Secretary of State must be satisfied that the earnings
         are from genuine employment, if the  Secretary  is  not  satisfied,
         points for those earnings will not be awarded


         (j)      In  making  the  assessment  under  paragraph  19(i),  the
         Secretary of State will assess on a balance  of  probabilities  and
         may take into account the following factors:


             (i) the evidence the applicant has submitted


             (ii)      whether  the  money  appears  to  have  been  earned
                  through genuine employment...


             (iii)     whether the business from  which  the  earnings  are
                  claimed  can  be  shown  to  exist  and  be  lawfully  and
                  genuinely trading;


             (iv)       verification  of  previous  earnings  claims   with
                  declarations made in respect of  the  applicant  to  other
                  Government departments,  including  declarations  make  in
                  respect of earnings claimed by the applicant  in  previous
                  applications;


             (v)  the  applicant's  previous   educational   and   business
                  experience...


             (vi)      the applicant's  immigration  history  and  previous
                  activity in the UK;


         ..."

 (31) Counsel for the Applicant  submitted  that  the  decision  reached  in
      relation to paragraph 245CD was irrational as the Respondent  had  not
      taken into account all of the factors listed in paragraph 9(j)  before
      deciding  on  a  balance  of  probabilities  whether  the  Applicant's
      earnings were  from  genuine  employment.  However,  as  submitted  by
      counsel for the Respondent, sub-paragraph 9(j) merely states that  the
      Respondent "may" take into account the factors listed below.  It  does
      not require the Respondent to take into account all of  these  factors
      and does not serve as a checklist. Concern over  any  one  factor  may
      give rise to a question over the genuineness of the employment  relied
      upon.

(32)  Giving the sub-paragraph in question its plain  and  ordinary  meaning
      no obligation arises to consider all of the evidence provided relating
      to the Applicant's other dealings with HMRC and UKVI.  Counsel for the
      Applicant sought to rely on paragraph 19 of R (on the  application  of
      Habib and  Fazal)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
      JR/1638/2018. This paragraph goes no further than finding  that,  even
      if the evidence of some of an applicant's past earnings was  found  to
      be unreliable, this  does  not  mean  that  evidence  of  his  current
      earnings in the form of  pay  slips  from  a  well-known  employer  or
      supplier is not genuine.

(33)  As a consequence of the above, it was not irrational  or  unlawful  to
      find that the Applicant did not meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph
      245CD of the Immigration Rules.

Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal

(34)  I refuse permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal because there  is
      no reasonable basis for asserting that the Respondent's  decision  was
      unlawful or unreasonable.

Costs

(35)  The Applicant do pay the Respondent's costs in the sum  of  �7,187  to
      be assessed in default of agreement, subject  to  any  submissions  in
      writing to be made within 21 days of service of this decision.

Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

A party may appeal against such a decision to  the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was given (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3(2)).
