For the Appellant:     Mr T Ojo of Graceland, Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    This is an appeal by the appellant against a decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing her appeal against the  respondent's  decision
    of 1 February 2016 refusing her application for further leave to remain
    on the basis of her family and private life.




Background

2.    The appellant is a citizen of Turkmenistan  born  on  25  April  1988.
    She first came to the UK as a student in 2009.  On  24  June  2011  she
    married her husband, a British national.  He was born 20 June 1969  and
    came from Turkey to the UK in December 1999.  He has now lived  in  the
    UK for 27 years.  Following her marriage,  the  appellant  returned  to
    Turkmenistan to make an application  for  entry  clearance.   This  was
    refused by the entry clearance officer but an appeal  was  subsequently
    allowed and the appellant returned to the UK  in  2012  with  leave  to
    enter as a dependent spouse valid until 15 May 2015. On 6 August  2015,
    she applied for further leave to remain both under the Rules and  under
    article 8 on the basis of her family life with her husband.

3.    Her application was refused.  Although the  respondent  was  satisfied
    that the appellant had a genuine and subsisting relationship  with  her
    partner, she found that there was no evidence to show that there  would
    be insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing  outside  the  UK
    within para EX.1.(b) of appendix  FM  and  there  were  no  exceptional
    circumstances warranting  a  grant  of  leave  to  remain  outside  the
    requirements of the Rules.  In  her  grounds  of  appeal  against  this
    decision   the   appellant   argued   that   her   removal   would   be
    disproportionate and would occasion  insurmountable  obstacles  to  her
    family life.  Her  husband  had  very  serious  challenges  with  heart
    disease and there would be very serious hardship for them in continuing
    their family life outside the UK.

The Decision of the First-Tier Tribunal.

4.    The judge  heard  oral  evidence  from  both  the  appellant  and  her
    husband.  The appellant's evidence is summarised at [7]-[18] and  [22]-
    [24] and her husband's at [25]-[35] of the  decision.   The  judge  was
    referred to medical reports about her husband's heart  condition  which
    confirmed that he had had a coronary artery bypass graft ï¿½ 3  performed
    on 25 June 2015 and had been discharged on 1 July 2015.

5.    In his assessment of the evidence at [44]-[75], the  judge  considered
    whether there were "insurmountable  obstacles"  within  para  EX.1.(b),
    namely "very significant difficulties  which  would  be  faced  by  the
    applicant and her partner in  continuing  their  family  life  together
    outside the UK and which could not be overcome  or  would  entail  very
    serious difficulties" (Ex.2.).  The judge noted  that  the  appellant's
    husband had had a successful artery bypass graft in June  2015  but  no
    current updated medical report had been provided [44] and there was  no
    evidence that he required any particular care or assistance on a day-to-
    day basis which could not be given to him by the appellant [51].  There
    was no evidence that the appellant and her partner would not be able to
    be assisted in either Turkey or Turkmenistan [51] or that  his  current
    medical condition would in any  way  prevent  his  ability  to  travel,
    reside or work abroad [53].

6.    The judge found from the evidence presented  that  the  appellant  and
    her husband would not face any significant  differences  in  continuing
    their family life together outside the UK  in  either  Turkmenistan  or
    Turkey [58].  For the same reasons, he found that there  would  not  be
    very significant obstacles under para 276ADE(1)(vi) to the  appellant's
    integration into Turkmenistan if she was required to leave UK.

7     The judge went on to consider the position under article  8  directing
    himself in accordance with the guidance  of  the  Supreme  Court  in  R
    (Agyarko) v Secretary of State [2017] UKSC 11.  He concluded that there
    were no exceptional or compelling circumstances in the appellant's case
    warranting consideration of her claim outside the Rules.  He went on to
    consider the Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 approach and the provisions of S117B
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  He found that the
    respondent's   decision   did   not   constitute   a   disproportionate
    interference with the appellant and her husband's right to respect  for
    family life.  Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed.

The Grounds of Appeal and Submissions.

8.    In the  grounds,  it  is  argued  that  the  judge  erred  in  law  in
    restricting  himself  to  the  test  of  insurmountable  obstacles  and
    exceptional circumstances without applying the reasonableness test  set
    out in MA (Pakistan) v Secretary of State [2009] EWCA Civ953  in  which
    the Court of Appeal confirmed the application of the  Chikwamba  [2008]
    UKHL 40 principles.  It is further argued that the judge erred  in  law
    and  misdirected  himself  in  that  the  appellant  met  the  test  of
    insurmountable  obstacles  and  exceptional  circumstances.    It   was
    foreseeable that she and her husband would become destitute and without
    money and the sponsor had lived in the UK for 27 years and  was  unable
    to return to his job  as  a  builder  without  exposing  himself  to  a
    significant risk that he might once again endanger his life.

9.    Mr Ojo adopted his grounds.  He submitted that the judge had given  no
    adequate reasons for the conclusion set out at [58] that the  appellant
    and her  husband  would  not  face  very  significant  difficulties  in
    continuing their family life together in either Turkmenistan or Turkey.
    It was accepted  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the  financial
    requirements of appendix FM but the judge had  failed  to  give  proper
    weight to the fact that her husband had lived in the UK  for  27  years
    and had  never  lived  in  Turkmenistan.  He  had  failed  properly  to
    consider, so he argued, the reasonableness of expecting them to  return
    to Turkmenistan where they would have no income or to consider the fact
    that, if the appellant was granted leave to remain, she would  be  able
    to work and contribute to the family finances.

10.   Ms Fijiwala submitted that the judge had directed  himself  impeccably
    on the proper approach as set out in Agyarko.  He had been entitled  to
    find that the appellant could not meet the high tests of  showing  that
    there were insurmountable obstacles to family life  continuing  outside
    the UK or that there were very compelling  circumstances  justifying  a
    grant of leave outside  the  Rules.   He  had  considered  the  medical
    evidence relating to the appellant's husband and was entitled  to  take
    into account the fact that he was capable of light  work  and  to  find
    that there was no obstacle  preventing  either  him  or  the  appellant
    obtaining employment abroad.

Assessment of the Issues.

11.   The grounds do not satisfy me that the  judge  erred  in  law  in  his
    approach to the issues in this appeal.  It is common  ground  that  the
    appellant could not meet the financial requirements of the  Rules  and,
    therefore, to qualify for leave within the Rules she had  to  meet  the
    requirements of para EX.1.(b) of showing that there were insurmountable
    obstacles in continuing their family life together outside the UK.  The
    judge properly directed himself in  accordance  with  the  guidance  in
    Agyarko.   He  reminded  himself  that  "insurmountable"  was   to   be
    understood in a practical and  realistic  sense  [55].   He  took  into
    account the medical condition of the  appellant's  husband.   He  noted
    that there was no further medical evidence additional  to  the  reports
    prepared in 2015.  He also noted the evidence that his doctor had  seen
    him two or three months previously and had told him that  he  could  do
    light work, he could not continue building work  but  could  obtain  an
    office job [33].

12.   It was open to the judge to find that his  current  medical  condition
    would not prevent his ability to travel, reside abroad or  work:  [53].
    He took into account the fact that he did not  wish  to  leave  the  UK
    where he had lived for 27 years [49].  I am satisfied that the  judge's
    decision on the issue of insurmountable obstacles was properly open  to
    him.  Mr Ojo argued that the judge had not given adequate  reasons  for
    his finding on this issue in [58] but when the judge's conclusions  are
    read in the context of his summary and assessment of the evidence,  his
    reasons are clear.

13.   It was also argued in the grounds that the judge erred by  restricting
    himself in assessing  insurmountable  obstacles  without  applying  the
    reasonableness test in MA (Pakistan).  There is no  substance  in  this
    argument. The test the judge had to apply was the test as  set  out  in
    the Rules as  interpreted  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  Agyarko,  which
    supersedes the earlier authorities under the previous Rules.  The  test
    is not one of reasonableness but whether  there  are  very  significant
    difficulties which could not be overcome or  which  would  entail  very
    serious hardship for the appellant and her husband.

14.   The grounds also refer to the House of Lords opinion in Chikwamba  but
    the guidance in that opinion must be  read  in  light  of  the  current
    requirements of the Rules.   In  Chikwamba  the  appellant  could  meet
    requirements of the Rules then in force save for requirement of  making
    the application for entry clearance from abroad.  In the  present  case
    the appellant is unable to meet the  substantive  requirements  of  the
    Rules and her position is therefore distinguishable from  the  position
    in Chikwamba.

15.   Having considered the matter within the Rules, the judge  went  on  to
    consider whether there were compelling circumstances warranting further
    consideration outside the Rules.  Again, he  directed  himself  on  the
    proper approach in accordance with the guidance  in  Agyarko  at  [63]-
    [64]. I am satisfied that he took all relevant matters into account and
    was entitled to find there were no such compelling  circumstances.   In
    any event, the judge adopted the Razgar  approach  and  considered  the
    provisions  of  the  2002  Act  and  was  entitled  to  find  that  the
    respondent's   decision   did   not   constitute   a   disproportionate
    interference with the appellant and her husband's right to respect  for
    their family life.

16.  In summary, I am not  satisfied  that  the  judge  erred  in  law.   He
    reached findings and conclusions properly open to him for  the  reasons
    he gave.

Decision.

17.   The First-tier Tribunal did  not  err  in  law  and  it  follows  that
    decision dismissing the appeal stands.
