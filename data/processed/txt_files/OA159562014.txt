                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



      Introduction


      1.    The Appellant appealed with  permission  granted  by  First-tier
           Tribunal  Judge  Brunnen  on  8  September  2016   against   the
           determination of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Ferguson  who  had
           dismissed the Appellant's appeal  seeking  settlement  with  his
           father  in  the  United  Kingdom  under  paragraph  297  of  the
           Immigration Rules in a decision and reasons  promulgated  on  20
           April 2016.


      2.    The Appellant is a national of Zimbabwe, born on 2 October 1996.
            He was 17 years  10  months  old  at  the  date  of  the  entry
           clearance  application  made  on  25  August  2014.   Both   the
           Appellant's parents were and are living in the  United  Kingdom,
           in contact with one another but separated.  His  mother  was  an
           overstayer as at  the  date  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer'
           decision.  The judge found that sole responsibility had not been
           demonstrated by the Appellant's sponsor (his father), that  both
           parents had parental  responsibility  and  that  there  were  no
           serious or compelling circumstances justifying  the  Appellant's
           admission to the United Kingdom at this  late  stage.   Nor  was
           there any disproportionate breach of Article 8 ECHR.


      3.    Permission to appeal was granted because it was considered  that
           it was arguable that the judge had erred because  there  was  no
           evidence to support his findings as to sole  responsibility  and
           he had considered the evidence at the wrong point in time.


      4.    Standard directions were made by the tribunal.




      Submissions


      5.    Mr Waheed for the Appellant relied on  the  grounds  of  onwards
           appeal.  In summary he  argued  that  the  judge  had  not  been
           entitled to reach his  findings  on  sole  responsibility.   The
           Entry  Clearance  Officer  had  been  required  under  the  2014
           Procedure Rules to produce evidence in support of the assertions
           concerning the Appellant's mother which had  been  made  in  the
           refusal notice, which had referred to her application for  leave
           to remain and a subsequent judicial review application, in which
           she had asserted financial  support  for  the  Appellant,  among
           other claims.  That evidence had not been produced yet the judge
           had  treated  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's   assertions   as
           evidence, as could be seen in [2] and [16] of the decision.  The
           Appellant's mother had given a different and lesser  version  of
           her involvement in her witness statement  which  the  judge  had
           failed to factor into  his  analysis.   These  were  fundamental
           errors and the decision should be set aside and remitted to  the
           First-tier Tribunal before another judge for a full rehearing.


      6.    Mr Jarvis for the Respondent submitted that there was  no  error
           of law and that the Appellant's onwards grounds were artificial.
            In any event, the Appellant's witnesses owed a duty of  candour
           to the First-tier Tribunal which they had not  discharged.   The
           previous inconsistent statements which  the  Appellant's  mother
           had made had not been in dispute before the  judge.   There  had
           been no suggestion that the Entry Clearance Officer had provided
           an inaccurate r�sum� of both the application for leave to remain
           and the judicial review.  The Appellant's mother had  been  free
           to produce her own version of those  documents.   If  any  doubt
           remained, Mr  Jarvis  made  application  for  the  admission  of
           further evidence pursuant to rule 15(2A) of the  Upper  Tribunal
           Procedure Rules.  These  had  been  served  on  the  Appellant's
           solicitors.  It was clear from the decision and reasons that the
           judge had approached the appeal on the correct date,  i.e.,  the
           date of decision.  There was no  justification  for  interfering
           with the judge's decision.


      7.    In reply, Mr Waheed reiterated his argument as to the failure of
           the Respondent to provide evidence.  The grounds of  appeal  had
           asserted that  the  mother  had  not  provided  support  to  the
           Appellant.   Mr  Waheed  opposed  the  application  for  further
           evidence, in that it was  hearsay  at  best,  not  the  original
           documents.




      No material error of law finding


      8.    The tribunal  granted  the  Respondent's  application  to  admit
           further evidence.  While it was not of  ideal  quality,  it  was
           nonetheless drawn from official records which there is a duty to
           maintain accurately.  The material  fully  supported  the  Entry
           Clearance  Officer's  assertions  about  the  mother's  previous
           claims in relation to the Appellant.


      9.    More importantly, as Mr Jarvis submitted, it is plain  from  the
           decision and reasons that there was no dispute before the  judge
           that the Entry  Clearance  Officer's  summary  of  the  mother's
           previous   inconsistent   statements   about   her   degree   of
           responsibility for the Appellant was accurate.  It  was  thus  a
           matter which the judge had to weigh in assessing the reliability
           of the evidence placed before him. The mother's  later  evidence
           was that she had exaggerated her financial contribution  to  the
           Appellant, but  that  was  implausible  in  itself  as  she  had
           admitted that she had been working notwithstanding  her  illegal
           presence in the United  Kingdom  and  was  thus  not  destitute.
           Hence the judge preferred her earlier evidence.   The  level  of
           her contact with her son was, however, a  continuous  thread  in
           the evidence as a whole: see, e.g.  [17]  of  the  decision  and
           reasons.


      10.   It must be said that there was nothing  remotely  surprising  in
           the judge's findings about the Appellant's mother's involvement.
            As the judge noted, it will be an exceptional  situation  where
           both parents are involved in the upbringing of a child that  one
           parent will have sole responsibility.  The judge found that  the
           evidence of the sponsor  in  particular  had  been  tailored  to
           minimise the mother's influence.  That finding was  based  on  a
           number of matters, including the sponsor's other evidence  about
           the mother's r�le in the Appellant's life and her visit  to  him
           in 2015.


      11.   Thus the judge's findings were grounded firmly in  the  evidence
           and in the proper inferences which he drew from  that  evidence.
           Any technical breach of the 2014 Procedure Rules  by  the  Entry
           Clearance Officer by non disclosure of  documents  whose  origin
           was from the Appellant's mother was not the subject of complaint
           before the judge as the point which the Entry Clearance  Officer
           was making as to the contents of  those  documents  was  not  in
           dispute.  The Appellant was not subjected to unfairness  of  any
           kind and the judge did not err in that way.


      12.   It is clear  from  the  decision  and  reasons  that  the  judge
           correctly assessed the facts as at the date of the decision,  as
           the  previous  version  of  section  85  of   the   Nationality,
           Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 still  then  in  force  applied.
           The challenge to the decision and reasons fails and the  onwards
           appeal must be dismissed.




      DECISION


      The making of the previous decision did not involve the  making  of  a
material error on a point of law and stands unchanged
