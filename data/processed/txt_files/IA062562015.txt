               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the appellant:         Mr J Parkinson, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the respondent:        In person


                            DECISION AND REASONS



1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the  First-
   tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal  against  the  Secretary  of  State's
   decision to remove him from the United  Kingdom  pursuant  to  Regulation
   19(3)(b) of the European Economic Area  Regulations  2006  (as  amended).
   The index offence was a conviction for conspiracy to commit burglary.

Background

2. The appellant is a citizen of Poland and thus an  EEA  citizen,  born  in
   September 1979. It is accepted that he has  permanent  residence  in  the
   United Kingdom because he has completed a period of 5 years in accordance
   with the Regulations.

3. On 7 May 2013 he was convicted of burglary from the John Lewis  warehouse
   where he had been working.  It was a sophisticated operation, involving a
   conspiracy by 7 men,  3  of  whom  had  worked  at  the  warehouse.   One
   defendant remained unidentified.  The remaining 6 were arrested 6  months
   after the burglary and all had Polish surnames.

4. The  sentencing  judge  found  that  the  burglary  was  planned  by  the
   appellant and another of the defendants, a Mr Martin  Bakowski,  who  had
   also stolen repeatedly from John Lewis while he  was  employed  by  them,
   those offences being dealt with at the same time.  The gang had bagged up
   �200,000 of property to steal: it was not clear why they only  took  with
   them goods worth �82,000, but that was still a substantial  amount.   The
   appellant disabled the burglar alarm:  the sentencing judge found that he
   was one of the two men who planned the burglary and that a serious breach
   of trust was involved.

5. The  sentencing  judge  took  into  account  that  the  offence  required
   'significant  planning  and  professionalism,  multiple  offenders  going
   equipped with implements to facilitate the  commission  of  the  offence,
   targeting  of  particular  premises  and  the  theft  of  property  of  a
   significant value'.  He gave credit for  the  appellant's  previous  good
   character and imposed a sentence of 5 years 6 months.  The appellant  did
   not plead guilty and continues to deny involvement in the offence.

Procedural history

6. The First-tier Tribunal found as a fact that the appellant  had  been  in
   the United Kingdom for 'a number of years' and had acquired the right  of
   permanent residence.  The Tribunal accepted  that  the  appellant  had  a
   partner here and that Article 8 ECHR was engaged by his removal.  It went
   on to perform a full Razgar assessment, finding that the appellant was in
   reality still living in the Polish community in the  United  Kingdom  and
   that the principal element of his private and family life  was  with  his
   Polish citizen partner who visits him weekly in  prison.   They  have  no
   children, either separately or together. There  were  no  significant  or
   insurmountable obstacles to  the  appellant's  reintegration  in  Poland,
   where both he and his partner had spent most of their lives.

7. The appellant had committed a serious crime and showed  no  remorse.   He
   had undertaken some courses in  prison.   Part  5A  of  the  Nationality,
   Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  was  inapplicable  to  this  appellant,
   because he is an EEA citizen.

8. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeal.

Grounds of appeal

9. The appellant appealed, relying on his private and  family  life  in  the
   United Kingdom, his lawful residence here and on Regulation 15 of the EEA
   Regulations.  He argued that as his partner  had  a  permanent  residence
   card, he should be treated as a family member with a  retained  right  of
   residence.  He pointed out that  the  co-conspirator  with  whom  he  was
   convicted had won his appeal against  deportation  and  been  allowed  to
   remain in the United Kingdom.  He also relied on the  provisions  of  the
   Immigration Rules at E-LTRP 10 and  on  Article  45(1)  and  (2)  of  the
   European  Union  Charter  of  Fundamental  Rights  (the   free   movement
   provision).

10. The appellant sought to  distinguish  the  decisions  of  the  Court  of
   Appeal in Essa v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2012]  EWCA
   Civ 1, Dumliauskas v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2015]
   EWCA Civ 145  and  AA  (Nigeria)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
   Department [2015] EWCA Civ 1249, arguing in relation to Essa that  he  is
   himself an EEA citizen and not from Somalia, and that  he  lives  in  the
   United Kingdom, rather than Norway or the Netherlands; and in relation to
   Dumliauskas,  that  he  had  not  the  multiple  convictions   which   Mr
   Dumliauskas had,  and that OASys assessed him as presenting a low risk of
   reoffending and no indication of risk of serious public interest.

Permission to appeal

11. The Upper Tribunal granted permission to appeal on the  basis  that  the
   First-tier Tribunal had arguably erred in law in failing to  address  the
   'serious  grounds'  test  adequately  or  to  give   sufficient   reasons
   thereunder, with particular reference to the OASys report  relied  on  by
   the appellant.

12. When granting permission, Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge  Cox  also  noted
   that the First-tier Tribunal had  not  referred  to  Regulation  21(5)(e)
   which provides that  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  themselves
   justify a decision to remove an EEA citizen who has  permanent  residence
   in the United Kingdom.

Rule 24 Reply

13. The respondent filed a reply under rule 24,  opposing  the  appeal,  and
   arguing that the  jj  had  directed  himself  appropriately.   The  Reply
   continued:

         "3.  The judge of the First-tier Tribunal noted at  [47]  that  the
         appellant had acquired permanent residence in  the  United  Kingdom
         and proceeded  to  examine  whether  in  substance  and  implicitly
         serious grounds to deportation were met.   On  the  facts  of  this
         case, given the seriousness of the offence  of  �200,000  theft  of
         good from John Lewis in breach of trust as an employee, the lengthy
         sentence of 5� years and the risk  of  reconviction  being  medium,
         such grounds did exist.  The failure to expressly mention  'serious
         grounds' does not reveal a material error of law, given that on the
         facts of this case, they are clearly made out.  The  judge  further
         goes on to consider rehabilitation and Article 8 in  an  impeccable
         manner. ..."

Error of law decision

14. On 22 October 2015, the Upper Tribunal found a material  error  of  law.
   The Tribunal noted that it was  common  ground  that  the  appellant  had
   acquired a permanent right of residence under  the  EEA  Regulations  and
   that the Regulation 21(3) test of 'serious grounds of  public  policy  or
   public security' (the 'serious grounds' test) must be met before he could
   be deported to Poland. In addition, all the requirements of Regulation  5
   must be satisfied if the respondent's decision were to be lawful.  Absent
   any mention of 'serious grounds' in the First-tier Tribunal  decision  in
   the discussion at [53] and following, the Upper Tribunal concluded that a
   material error of law had occurred in relation to Regulation 21(3).

15. In  relation  to  Regulation  21(5)(c)  and  (e),  and  the  failure  to
   distinguish between  the  National  Offender  Management  Service  (NOMS)
   report in June 2013, which found that the appellant posed a  medium  risk
   of reoffending, and the OASys Assessment prepared in February  2014,   in
   which he was assessed as presenting a low risk of further offending,  the
   Upper Tribunal considered  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  reasoning  to  be
   inadequate, as envisaged by the Court of Appeal  in  R  (Iran)  &  Ors  v
   Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2005]  EWCA  Civ  982  at
   paragraph 90.2 in the judgment of Lord Justice Brooke. The  Tribunal  had
   failed adequately to assess whether the appellant's personal conduct  now
   presented a 'genuine, present and  sufficiently  serious  threat  to  the
   fundamental interests of society' (the 'sufficiently  serious'  test)  as
   Regulation 21(5) requires.

16. The Upper Tribunal found a material error of law on both heads  and  set
   aside the decision to be remade in due course, before any  judge  of  the
   Upper Tribunal. They did not consider  that  any  of  the  other  grounds
   advanced constituted an error of law.   In particular, in relation to the
   appellant's co-conspirator,  they  were  not  aware  whether  his  appeal
   judgment had been before the First-tier Tribunal nor were  they  prepared
   to indicate whether it would be relevant when the decision was reheard.

17. That was the basis on which the appeal came before me for remaking.

Evidence before the Upper Tribunal

18. The NOMS report was prepared in June 2013, not long after the  appellant
   and his co-defendants were sentenced.  It recorded the  appellant's  lack
   of previous convictions in the United Kingdom and that it was  not  known
   whether he had any convictions for offences committed  abroad.  The  NOMS
   report is  sketchy,  as  little  information  was  available  to  whoever
   prepared it Section 3 (assessment of risk of serious harm) and section  4
   (likelihood of reconviction) are not completed. Section  5  records  that
   the appellant was at HM Prison Woodhill and  that  the  OASys  assessment
   would be completed by the Prison Service.

19. In response to a  question  concerning  the  risk  of  serious  harm  to
   others, the report says that the appellant 'is currently  assessed  as  a
   Tier 3 offender indicating a medium risk of serious  harm.   This  is  an
   interim assessment pending completion of a full OASys assessment'.  There
   had been no pre-sentence report and the risk of reconviction was assessed
   as 8% in the first year after release and 15% after 2 years, on the basis
   that there were no overseas convictions.  It would be reassessed  if  any
   such convictions were discovered.

20. The full OASys report was completed 8 months later,  in  February  2014.
   There was still  no  information  available  other  than  what  could  be
   ascertained by interviewing the appellant.  The  appellant  continued  to
   deny his involvement and to say that the iPad found in his possession had
   been bought by him from Mr Bakowski, who also worked  at  the  warehouse,
   and that he did not know it was stolen.  He had appealed, unsuccessfully,
   against the conviction and his case  was  now  being  considered  by  the
   Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC).

21. The person who undertook the OASys analysis did not know how many  other
   offenders had been involved.  They could  not  therefore  say  what  peer
   group influences were involved.  Mr Bakowski was also  Polish,  according
   to the appellant. The motivation  for  the  offence  was  assumed  to  be
   financial, but as the appellant continued to deny having committed it, it
   was impossible to take that further. It was noted that the appellant  had
   no documented previous convictions in the United Kingdom  or  abroad,  so
   there was no question of escalation  in  offending.  There  was  also  no
   indication that the offence was linked to any risk of serious harm.

22. The appellant had completed his education in Poland age 16  and  had  no
   difficulty with reading, writing or numeracy.  As a teenager he had tried
   ecstasy and cannabis once each, but did not like the effect they  had  on
   him and did not do it again.

23. In Poland, the appellant took a 3-year course in Electrical  Engineering
   after leaving school, and then worked in his father's small company for 3-
   4 years.  He had also been a clothes shop assistant,  returning  to  work
   for his father between times.  His father was considering selling up  his
   business in Poland and coming to the  United  Kingdom  to  live,  perhaps
   investing his money in a business here for a better return on his  money.
   The appellant hoped he might  be  employed  in  his  father's  investment
   business if that happened.

24. The report recorded that the appellant and  his  partner  had  lived  in
   Northampton since 2005.   His  partner  had  not  been  involved  in  the
   offence.  There were no domestic violence issues and the  couple  had  no
   children. He did not have much spare time but what there was,  he  mostly
   spent with his partner.  They led a quiet life: he would  go  home  after
   work and they would watch television together, or sometimes go to the pub
   with friends.  He would drink a couple of glasses of wine, several  times
   a week, and occasionally 2-3 vodka shots in an evening at  a  party.   He
   had not consumed any alcohol in prison.

25. The appellant enjoyed travelling round the United Kingdom to see  places
   of interest, or going back occasionally to Poland to visit  his  parents.
   They had met at a party in 2005 and been together ever since: she visited
   him regularly in prison.  The appellant intended to go back to  the  flat
   and live with her again  when  released,  if  he  was  not  deported.  If
   deported to Poland, he could live with his parents, but  their  intention
   was to come to the United Kingdom  when  they  retired,  which  might  be
   before his release.

26. The appellant had worked for John Lewis for 5 years before the  offence,
   earning �1200 a month plus occasional bonuses. His partner worked too and
   they were doing fine  financially  until  his  arrest.   Thereafter,  the
   police kept his papers and he could not get work, so they  did  run  into
   financial difficulty.  He had taken a consolidation loan and  was  paying
   off �10-15 a month.

27. The appellant had no psychiatric issues or pending  treatment.   He  was
   not depressed and kept busy in prison, with a positive outlook.  He mixed
   with others on the wing and used the gym  a  lot.   Sometimes  he  played
   Monopoly.  He had no self-harm or suicide issues. He said he did not have
   a temper, and there was no evidence to the contrary.  The writer  of  the
   report said this:

         "11.9         [The appellant] is  capable  of  understanding  other
         people's  views,  he  communicates  well  and   comes   across   as
         intelligent in his discussions.

         [The  appellant]  maintained  good  eye  contact   throughout   the
         interview and answered my questions intelligently.   He  maintained
         throughout the interview that  he  was  not  involved  interest  eh
         offence and he had just bought an iPad thro a friend he worked with
         (who has also been convicted  of  the  same  offence).   It  is  my
         opinion  that  [the  appellant's]  judgment  was  clouded  in  this
         situation and he was persuaded in some way by others to be involved
         in this offence, however small, and therefore  has  been  convicted
         for his lapse of judgment. ...

         12.1     [The appellant] did not show  any  pro-criminal  attitudes
         throughout the  interview.   This  is  the  first  time  that  [the
         appellant] has  committed  any  offence  and  been  convicted.   He
         continues to deny his  involvement  interest  he  offence  but  did
         disclose that he had bought an iPad from a friend and was  tied  in
         to the offence through the Police checking the serial number on it.
          However he has been committed by the  courts  and  the  length  of
         sentence suggests that he was more involved than he admits."

28. The appellant said he would definitely not commit any  further  offences
   in future. The writer of the report did not consider that a full analysis
   was required as the appellant was  not  of  a  violent  nature.   He  was
   assessed as presenting a low risk of any future offending.

29. Certificates presented  show  that  on  26  August  2014  the  appellant
   completed his NVQ Level 2 in Barbering. He also achieved OCR Level  2  in
   IT User Skills (ITQ) and OCR Level 1 CLAiT Plus International Certificate
   for IT Users.  He had a Certificate of Completion for the one  module  of
   the Restore Prison Programme, run by the Forgiveness Project.  He  passed
   several units of the Level 1 Award in Basic Construction Skills  and  the
   OCR Functional Skills qualification in English at Entry 3,  the  Cleaning
   Professionals Skills Suite, and modules in the  Level  1  Certificate  in
   Creative Techniques in 2D.

The appellant's evidence

30. On 18 December 2013, the appellant had  applied  for  a  review  of  his
   conviction by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC).   On  3  March
   2015, the CCRC rejected his application, stating that there was  no  real
   possibility  that  the  conviction  would  be  quashed  or  his  sentence
   reviewed.  They invited further submissions,  not  later  than  31  March
   2015.  The appellant replied, saying that the CCRC had misunderstood  him
   and his case, that someone else had blamed the burglary on the appellant,
   and that he was an innocent man wrongly convicted. He had been unable  to
   obtain copies of the initial police interviews,  which  the  police  said
   were lost, and he asked the CCRC to use its powers to obtain  those.   He
   accused the CCRC of 'simply trying to close my case', and  said  that  he
   would be instructing solicitors to make a fresh application.

31. In oral evidence before the First-tier Tribunal on  7  April  2015,  the
   appellant gave evidence which is consistent  with  the  above  summarised
   material. The only additional evidence to note is that the  appellant  is
   an only child; that the reason he worked as a salesman was that he  found
   it difficult to get a job as an electrical engineer in Poland;  and  that
   once he was working, he lived away from home in rented accommodation  and
   had only sparse contact with his parents.   He  was  estranged  from  his
   parents because of his conviction: his father did not want to talk to him
   and he had last spoken to his  mother  in  about  August  2014.   He  had
   cousins in the United Kingdom but they were  too  scared  to  attend  the
   appeal hearing to support him.

32. The appellant had last visited Poland in about  2010  with  his  partner
   and stayed with friends.  During other visits, he had met  his  partner's
   mother and stayed with her once.

33. The appellant had family life with his Polish partner.  They lived in  a
   property in Northampton which she owned, and the mortgage was in her sole
   name: the property had been bought at the height of the property boom and
   was now worth less than she had paid for it, making it hard  for  her  to
   sell.  She had grown up in a small town in  Poland,  about  100  km  from
   Warsaw, and come to the United Kingdom  8  years  earlier  (so  in  about
   2006).  Her parents still lived in Poland but were separated; she kept in
   contact with her mother  but  not  her  father.   Her  brother  lived  in
   Northampton too, and she  had  a  cousin  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
   appellant's partner worked as a bookkeeper. She  could  not  relocate  to
   Poland as she would  have  no  job  and  her  mother  lived  in  a  small
   apartment.  She had not met the appellant's family in Poland.

34. At the Upper Tribunal hearing the  appellant  gave  evidence.   He  said
   that if released he would try to overturn his conviction.   He  confirmed
   that his partner still had her bookkeeping job.   Before  that,  she  had
   worked as a clerk in  a warehouse, but the company  had  closed  and  she
   changed jobs.  The salary was similar.

35. The appellant said he was on track to be released and had no trouble  in
   prison.  He had undertaken 1  of  9  units  on  the  Forgiveness  Project
   course: he had not been aware of this course before and it was definitely
   helping.

36. He confirmed that before going to prison he had worked  'all  the  time'
   in the John Lewis warehouse, operating trucks in the warehouse and so on.
   They had managed financially.

37. In cross-examination, the appellant was asked detailed questions on  the
   financial documents he had produced.  He said that his  partner  had  the
   flat, with a mortgage of �90,000 and he paid the food and other expenses.
    He had earned about �15000 a year at John Lewis.  He  acknowledged  that
   there were several missed payments on the mortgage and that  the  arrears
   were going up, not down.  The credit card balance was also going up, with
   charges for late payment and going over the limit.

38. The appellant produced a job offer from  Choice  Render.   He  had  only
   been offered the job in the last few days before the hearing and had been
   unable to serve the document in advance.  The firm wanted to  train  him,
   to develop his  skills,  and  he  had  got  the  job  after  a  telephone
   interview.  One  of  his  friends  was  already  working  there  and  had
   recommended the appellant to his employers:  he understood that  the  pay
   was about �80 a day  to  begin  with.  Another  friend  had  written  the
   appellant's skeleton argument for him as he did not have enough knowledge
   to express himself in writing.

39. In re-examination, the appellant told me  that  he  wanted  to  put  his
   crime behind him and go back to his partner.  He had come to  the  United
   Kingdom to work and he now just  wanted  to  live  a  normal  life,  with
   definitely no further crime.

Submissions

40. The appellant relied on his skeleton argument.  He told me that  he  was
   not a lawyer and was not able to argue his case orally, but with the help
   of his partner he had put his case in writing.  The skeleton argument  is
   short and is as follows:

         "The appellant would like to make the following submission:

             1.   It is very lately noticed an important point that even in
             the NOMS report also risk level is shown as low. However,  the
             right hand side location of  tick  boxes  is  giving  a  wrong
             impression  that  risk  level  of  appellant  to  be   medium.
             Unfortunately, due to human error this little mistake was  not
             identified before First-tier Tribunal  as  well  as  the  last
             hearing before this Honourable  Court  (Upper  Tribunal).   In
             fact, was mentioned very clearly mentioned in the report  that
             risk level to 0-40% to be Low Risk, 41-99% to be  Medium  Risk
             and 100-168% to be as High Risk.  The appellant's  risk  level
             was identified as 8% in the first year and 15% for the  second
             year.  Hence the risk level of the appellant can be  concluded
             even as very Low.

             2.   Another point came for discussion  at  the  last  hearing
             that  financial  burdens  could  motivate  appellant  for  re-
             offending.  The appellant humbly claims that such  proposition
             to be untrue in the given circumstances.  There is outstanding
             mortgage on the appellant's family home.  However, this is not
             at all serious financial problem because  appellant's  partner
             is earning handsome money and the  payment  of  �400  mortgage
             cannot be an unaffordable burden.  The appellant's partner can
             even maintain appellant with her sole earnings.  The appellant
             is a model prisoner who has  gained  skills  from  prison  and
             achieved certificates in Hospitality,  Hair  Cutting  and  Gym
             Course etc.  The job offer is also readily available  for  the
             appellant to take up employment upon release.

             In  view  of  the  above  stated  reasons  and   circumstances
             appellant humbly pray  the  Honourable  Court  to  allow  this
             appeal and to grant permission to the appellant  to  join  his
             spouse in the interest of justice."

41. For the respondent, Mr Parkinson said that there were  very  significant
   difficulties in assessing the risk of reoffending in the case of  someone
   who, like this appellant, did not accept the basis of his conviction.  He
   was not well paid even when he worked and he had financial problems;  his
   partner could not manage financially while the appellant was in prison.

42. The proposed job offer  came  too  late  and  was  too  vague.   It  was
   inadequate to establish a real likelihood of employment in the future. It
   seemed that the appellant had made no real attempt to  address  budgetary
   or financial issues which were the key to his problems.

43. The appellant was a convicted criminal who had been released on  licence
   having been convicted of a serious offence involving a  breach  of  trust
   and high value burglary: the appellant had been the 'inside man'.  He was
   not now a man of good character with a  blameless  record  and  obtaining
   employment which paid enough to keep him out of trouble financially would
   be difficult.  Mr Parkinson suggested that the appellant would  earn,  at
   best, the minimum wage.

44. Mr Parkinson submitted that there was a significant likelihood that  the
   appellant would return  to  criminality  if  his  financial  difficulties
   recurred.  He contended that on the facts, Regulation 21(5) did not avail
   the appellant and he should be deported.

45. I reserved my decision, which I now give.

Material facts

46. In the light of  the  evidence  I  have  read  and  heard,  I  find  the
   following facts to be established:

     a) The appellant has permanent residence in the United Kingdom.

     b) He has a genuine relationship with his partner, and  their  finances
        were stable until he committed the present offence.  The appellant's
        partner has struggled to cope financially without him  working  too,
        since he lost his job after the index offence and the respondent has
        his documents. The appellant and his partner have no children.  They
        have some extended family in the United Kingdom  but  their  private
        and family life is principally with each other.

     c) The appellant's parents, and those of his  partner,  still  live  in
        Poland.  The appellant is not close to his parents: his father  will
        not speak to him since his conviction, and he has not heard from his
        mother since April 2015. His partner is close only to her mother.  I
        place no weight on the appellant's suggestion that his parents  will
        retire to the United Kingdom and reinvest in a business  which  will
        employ him: given the estrangement between  the  appellant  and  his
        parents, any such assertion is unrealistic.

     d) The appellant's offence was a very serious one and his role  was  as
        one of the two central planners, but there is no evidence of general
        criminality in his background in the United Kingdom and no  evidence
        has been produced that he has committed any crimes elsewhere.

     e) The appellant is hard working and ambitious  to  better  and  redeem
        himself.  He has taken every training opportunity available  to  him
        while in prison and has identified a job which he  may  be  able  to
        take up if he is released. His relationship  with  his  partner  has
        survived the strain placed upon it by his imprisonment.

47. I have considered the NOMS and OASys reports.  The  NOMS  report  is  so
   vague that it can be given hardly any weight. I find that the risk of re-
   conviction identified therein is 8% in the first year after  release  and
   15% in the second, which is not 'medium' but 'low'.  There is no conflict
   between the two reports on that risk.

48. The OASys report is more thorough  but  the  assessment  there  made  is
   hampered because the appellant does not  accept  that  he  committed  the
   index offence and has gone to great lengths to try  to  clear  his  name.
   The usual methods of assessing the likelihood of  reconviction  are  less
   effective.  Both reports assess the appellant as having a low  likelihood
   of reconviction, and in the OASys report he stated clearly that he had no
   intention of committing any more crimes.  He said the same in his  First-
   tier Tribunal hearing and before me.

Legal framework

49. The relevant provisions of the  EEA  Regulations  are  to  be  found  in
   Regulation 21:

         "Decisions taken on  public  policy,  public  security  and  public
         health grounds

         21.-(1)  In this regulation a  "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
         decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public security  or
         public health.

         (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.

         (3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect  of  a  person
         with a permanent right of residence under regulation 15  except  on
         serious grounds of public policy or public security ...

         (5)  Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public policy
         or public security it shall, in  addition  to  complying  with  the
         preceding paragraphs of this regulation,  be  taken  in  accordance
         with the following principles-

              (a)     the  decision  must  comply  with  the  principle  of
              proportionality;
              (b)      the  decision  must  be  based  exclusively  on  the
              personal conduct of the person concerned;
              (c)     the personal conduct of  the  person  concerned  must
              represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious  threat
              affecting one of the fundamental interests of society;
              (d)     matters isolated from the particulars of the case  or
              which relate to considerations of general prevention  do  not
              justify the decision;
              (e)     a person's previous criminal convictions  do  not  in
              themselves justify the decision.

         (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on  the  grounds  of  public
         policy or public security in relation to a person who  is  resident
         in the United Kingdom the  decision  maker  must  take  account  of
         considerations such  as  the  age,  state  of  health,  family  and
         economic situation of the person, the person's length of  residence
         in the United Kingdom, the person's social and cultural integration
         into the United Kingdom and the extent of the person's  links  with
         his country of origin."

50. Further assistance as to how to apply Regulations  21(5)  and  21(6)  is
   available from the Court of Appeal decision in Dumliauskas and the  Upper
   Tribunal's decision in MC (Essa principles recast) [2015] UKUT 520 (IAC).
    It is accepted here that the appellant does have permanent residence but
   it is not asserted that he can meet the higher 'imperative grounds' level
   of protection which Regulation 21(4) affords.

51. At [54] in the judgment of Sir Stanley Burnton, with whom Lord  Justices
   Jackson and Floyd agreed, the Court of Appeal in Dumliauskas held that:

         "54.          Lastly, in agreement with what was said by the  Upper
         Tribunal in Vasconcelos, I do not consider that in the case  of  an
         offender with no permanent right of  residence  substantial  weight
         should be given to rehabilitation. I  appreciate  that  all  Member
         States  have  an  interest  in  reducing  criminality,   and   that
         deportation merely exports the offender, leaving him free to offend
         elsewhere. However, the whole point of  deportation  is  to  remove
         from this country someone whose offending renders him a risk to the
         public. The Directive recognises that the more serious the risk  of
         reoffending, and the offences that he may commit, the  greater  the
         right to interfere  with  the  right  of  residence.  Article  28.3
         requires the most serious risk, i.e. "imperative grounds of  public
         security", if a Union citizen has resided in the host Member  State
         for the previous 10 years. Such grounds will  normally  indicate  a
         greater  risk  of  offending  in  the  country  of  nationality  or
         elsewhere in the Union. In other words, the  greater  the  risk  of
         reoffending, the greater the right to deport."

52. In MC (Essa recast), the Upper Tribunal gave  further  guidance  in  its
   judicial headnote, as follows:
         "1.              Essa  rehabilitation  principles  are  specific to
         decisions taken on public policy, public security and public health
         grounds under regulation 21 of the 2006 EEA Regulations.
         2.              It is only if the personal  conduct  of  the person
         concerned is found to represent a genuine, present and sufficiently
         serious threat  affecting  one  of  the  fundamental  interests  of
         society (regulation 21(5)(c)) that it becomes relevant to  consider
         whether the decision is proportionate taking into account  all  the
         considerations identified in regulation 21(5)-(6).
         3.              There is no  specific  reference  in  the expulsion
         provisions  of  either  Directive  2004/38/EC  or  the   2006   EEA
         Regulations to rehabilitation, but it has been seen by the Court of
         Justice as an aspect of integration, which is one  of  the  factors
         referred to in Article 28(1) and regulation 21(6) (Essa  (2013)  at
         [23]).
         4.              Rehabilitation is not an issue to  be  addressed in
         every EEA deportation or removal decision  taken  under  regulation
         21; it will not be relevant, for  example,  if  rehabilitation  has
         already been completed (Essa (2013) at [32]-[33]).
         5.              Reference to prospects  of  rehabilitation concerns
         reasonable prospects of a person  ceasing  to  commit  crime  (Essa
         (2013) at [35]), not the mere possibility of  rehabilitation.  Mere
         capability of rehabilitation is not to be equated  with  reasonable
         prospect of rehabilitation.
         6.              Where relevant (see (4) above) such prospects are a
         factor to be taken into account in the  proportionality  assessment
         required by regulation 21(5) and (6) ((Dumliauskas [41]).
         7.              Such prospects are to be taken into account even if
         not raised by the offender Dumliauskas [52]).
          8.              Gauging  such  prospects  requires  assessing  the
         relative prospects of rehabilitation in the host  Member  State  as
         compared with those in the Member State  of  origin,  but,  in  the
         absence of evidence, it is not to be  assumed  that  prospects  are
         materially different in that other Member State (Dumliauskas  [46],
         [52]-[53] and [59]).
         9.                Matters  that  are  relevant  when  examining the
         prospects of the rehabilitation of offenders  include  family  ties
         and   responsibilities,   accommodation,    education,    training,
         employment, active membership of a community  and  the  like  (Essa
         (2013) at [34]). However, lack of access to a Probation Officer  or
         equivalent in the  other  Member  State  should  not,  in  general,
         preclude deportation (Dumliauskas [55])
         10.          In the absence of integration and a right of permanent
         residence, the future prospects of integration cannot be a  weighty
         factor (Dumliauskas [44] and [54]). Even when such  prospects  have
         significant weight they are not a trump card, as what the Directive
         and the 2006 EEA Regulations require  is  a  wide-ranging  holistic
         assessment. Both recognise  that  the  more  serious  the  risk  of
         reoffending, and the offences that a person may commit, the greater
         the right to interfere with the right of residence (Dumliauskas  at
         [46] and [54])."

53. On 8 December 2015, in AA (Nigeria), Lord Justice Richards,  giving  the
   only reasoned judgment in the Court of Appeal said this:
          "35.    ...nothing in Dias, Onuekwere or MG is  directed  towards
          the criteria to be applied under  the  Directive,  in  particular
          pursuant to Article 27(2) and  Article  28(1),  when  determining
          whether expulsion is  justified  by  serious  grounds  of  public
          policy  or  public  security;  criteria  which  are  mirrored  in
          regulation 21 of the EEA Regulations  and  were  applied  by  the
          tribunals in this case. The CJEU decisions are concerned with the
          test for  acquisition  of  the  relevant  status,  not  with  the
          approach to be adopted towards  the  justification  of  expulsion
          once that status is acquired.
          36.     I nevertheless think it appropriate to  look  in  greater
          detail at the way in which the tribunals dealt with the issue  of
          justification for the respondent's deportation, in order to  show
          that the effect of the offence and the sentence  of  imprisonment
          on  his  integration  within  the  United  Kingdom   were   taken
          specifically into account. Examination of the reasoning will also
          help  to  explain  an  outcome  that  may  at  first  sight  seem
          surprising,
          37.     The First-tier Tribunal pointed out that  the  respondent
          to the present appeal (the appellant  before  the  tribunal)  had
          resided in the United Kingdom well in excess of ten years, though
          the period had been interrupted after eight and a half  years  by
          his  imprisonment.  ...  The  tribunal  proceeded,  however,   to
          determine the appeal on the agreed basis that serious grounds  of
          public policy or public security had to be shown. ...
          38.     In considering whether  there  were  serious  grounds  of
          public policy or public  security  to  justify  deportation,  the
          tribunal took into account the seriousness of the offence  itself
          but also noted inter alia that regulation 21(5)(e) requires  that
          the personal conduct of the person concerned should represent  "a
          genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of
          the fundamental interests of society", and that regulation  21(6)
          requires account to be taken of considerations such as age, state
          of health, family and economic situation, length of residence  in
          the United Kingdom, social  and  cultural  integration  into  the
          United Kingdom and the extent of links with country of origin.
          39.     The tribunal considered that  the  question  whether  the
          respondent  represented  a  genuine,  present  and   sufficiently
          serious threat was the central issue.  It  examined  a  range  of
          considerations in reaching a  finding  that  the  respondent  was
          unlikely to reoffend;  and  in  the  light  of  that  finding  it
          concluded that the respondent did not represent such a threat and
          that the decision to deport him must for that reason fail.
          40.     In case it was wrong on that point, the tribunal went  on
          to consider the factors personal to the respondent which appeared
          to relate to the proportionality of the decision to  deport  him.
          It  described  it  as  beyond  doubt  that  the  respondent  "has
          established a private and family life  in  the  UK  and  to  that
          extent is socially and  culturally  integrated  into  the  United
          Kingdom in such a way that these links, including the  very  real
          probability  of  continued  employment,  have   been   maintained
          notwithstanding the period of imprisonment"  (paragraph  56).  On
          the other hand, it accepted that the  family  could  relocate  to
          Norway  without  much  difficulty  and  that  it  would  not   be
          unreasonable to look to the family to migrate there  together  to
          re-establish their family life. Finally, it considered the  issue
          of rehabilitation, whilst regarding the question  as  superfluous
          in view of its finding that the  respondent  was  not  a  present
          threat.  It  concluded   that   he   was   "well   advanced"   in
          rehabilitation,  that  "there  is   a   substantial   degree   of
          integration in the UK" and that it would be  disproportionate  to
          proceed to deportation in these circumstances (paragraph 59).  It
          added  that  there  might  well  be  a   deterioration   in   the
          respondent's rehabilitation were he returned to  Norway,  because
          of difficulties in the job market there and other factors. ...
          42.     I agree with the Upper Tribunal Judge that the First-tier
          Tribunal did not err in law. ..."

54. That is the legal basis on which the material facts of this  appeal  are
   to be approached.

Discussion

55. The facts in  this  appeal  are  not  dissimilar  to  those  in  the  AA
   (Nigeria) case.  The appellant's family life has continued strong despite
   his incarceration;  there  would  not  be  much  difficulty  in  his  re-
   establishing himself in Poland if he is required to do so as he is young,
   fit, healthy, well qualified and has retained  his  social  (if  not  his
   family) links with Poland. As far as Regulation 21(6) is  concerned,  the
   factors therein set out do not prevent his removal.

56. However,  Regulation  21(6)  on  these  facts  is  not  reached:   under
   Regulation 21(5), a decision to remove  an  EEA  citizen  with  permanent
   residence must be proportionate; that it must be based exclusively on his
   personal  conduct,  which  must  represent  a   'genuine,   present   and
   sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of
   society'.  The decision cannot be justified by 'matters isolated from the
   particulars of the case or which  relate  to  considerations  of  general
   prevention' or by the previous criminal  convictions alone.

57. The personal conduct of this appellant amounts to this:  he  has  led  a
   quiet, economically productive life in the United Kingdom,  but  he  also
   committed a very serious offence,  amounting  to  a  criminal  conspiracy
   based on his own significant breach of trust.  The motive for the offence
   appears to have been financial: that was also the  reason  the  appellant
   came to the United Kingdom and remained here, and the reason he worked to
   acquire further qualifications in prison, so that he could put right  his
   family finances by working in a well-paid job when he was released.

58. It is right that the appellant continues to protest and  seek  to  prove
   his innocence of the offence of which  he  was  convicted.   That  is  an
   element of personal conduct, showing no insight into the offence, but  it
   is not criminal behaviour nor does his attempt lawfully to set aside  the
   conviction or reduce the sentence represent a threat to  the  fundamental
   interests of society.  I note that  the  claimant  in  AA  (Nigeria)  had
   committed a crime which attracted a sentence of similar length.

59. The appellant does not drink heavily, is not violent, and does  not  use
   drugs.  He has worked in the United Kingdom and until he went to  prison,
   his credible evidence is that he and  his  partner  managed  financially,
   although their incomes were not great.  While  in  prison,  he  used  the
   opportunity to obtain further qualifications to help him work when he was
   released, and also addressed the effect  of  his  offending  through  the
   Forgiveness Project. He has stated clearly and repeatedly  that  he  does
   not intend to repeat his crime and has learned his lesson.

60. There is no evidence of any other criminal  or  reprehensible  behaviour
   by this appellant, either before he came to the United Kingdom, or during
   his stay here.  The respondent's  decision  is  therefore  based  on  his
   single criminal conviction alone. The  respondent  has  not  demonstrated
   that the appellant presents a sufficiently serious threat to one  of  the
   fundamental interests of the United Kingdom.    Deportation of  this  EEA
   citizen is not lawful.

61. The question of rehabilitation does not, therefore, arise:  if  it  had,
   on a proper reading of the NOMS and OASys reports they  agree  that  this
   appellant presents a very low  risk  of  re-conviction.   The  burden  of
   showing the contrary is on the respondent, if she wishes  to  prove  that
   she can legally remove him:  however,  the  respondent  has  produced  no
   evidence of criminality in the United Kingdom or any other country.

DECISION

62. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:


   The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error on  a
   point of law.
   I set aside the previous decision.  I remake the decision by allowing the
   appeal under the EEA Regulations.
