Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Brocklesby-Weller, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents/Claimants:  Mr M Iqbal of Counsel, instructed by SHN
Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The claimants are citizens of Pakistan who came to the  United  Kingdom
    in 2009 as students and who applied on 26 February 2015  for  leave  to
    remain as Tier 1 Entrepreneurs.  Their applications were refused  in  a
    decision of 28 April 2015.  The claimants sought to appeal against that
    decision, which appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Oliver  on
    7 December 2015.  The appeal was allowed.

2.   The Secretary of State  seeks  to  challenge  the  lawfulness  of  that
    decision.  Permission to make such a challenge  was  granted  by  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Kebede on 1 August 2016.  Thus the matter  comes  before
    me  to  determine  whether  or  not  the  determination  is  materially
    defective or not.  The starting point for the  appeal  clearly  is  the
    reasons for decision letter of 28 April 2015.

3.   It is a condition to be met  that  the  claimants  have  a  substantial
    investment in money into the  business.   To  show  that  investment  a
    number of documents were submitted with the application, in  particular
    a document from Sarmad & Co Chartered Certified  Accountants  dated  13
    February 2015 (F1) setting out the  amounts  of  money  paid  into  the
    business account from 20 November 2012 until  4  February  2015.   That
    investment is said  to  have  been  �204,942.78.  Copies  of  the  bank
    statements were enclosed from G1 to G6.  An issue arose as  to  whether
    there was a complete set  of  statements.   It  was  contended  by  the
    claimants that a complete set had been submitted at  the  time  of  the
    application, but in any event a  further  set  was  supplied  upon  the
    notice of appeal, which are in the bundle.

4.   In addition audited  statement  of  accounts  were  presented  for  the
    period 20 June 2012 to 30 June 2013, also for the year ending  30  June
    2014 for the period 1 July 2014 to 5 February 2015.   In  refusing  the
    application the Secretary of State cited  paragraphs  46-SD(a)  to  46-
    SD(e) of Appendix A of the  Immigration  Rules.   Reliance  was  placed
    particularly on paragraph 46-SD(b) which provides as follows:-

         "Audited or unaudited accounts must show the  investment  in  money
         made directly by the applicant, in his own name or  on  his  behalf
         (and showing his name).  If he has invested by way of share capital
         the business accounts must show the shareholders,  the  amount  and
         value  of  the  shares  (on  the  date  of  the  purchase)  in  the
         appellant's name as it appears on his application.  If the value of
         the applicant's share capital is not shown in  the  accounts,  then
         share certificates must be submitted as documentary evidence.   The
         accounts must clearly show the name of the  accountant,  the  dates
         the accounts were produced, and how much the appellant has invested
         in the business.  Accounts must  be  prepared  and  signed  off  in
         accordance with statutory requirements."

5.   Put simply the Secretary  of  State  contended  that  the  accounts  as
    submitted did not meet those requirements.  It was considered that  the
    accountants' letter together with the bank statements was not specified
    evidence as required under the Rules.

6.   The first challenge to the determination is  that  the  Judge  did  not
    engage with that issue in any way or at all.

7.   In paragraph 4 of the determination is set out the following:

         "Both appellants submitted that  their  statements  in  which  they
         traced their immigration  history  and  the  preparation  of  their
         applications based on their formation of F and  T  Enterprise  Ltd.
         The accounts showed investment of �204,942.78.  They were not asked
         for any additional evidence.  The  account  showed  investments  in
         their own names."

8.   That is to mis-state the reality of the  matter  because  it  is  clear
    that the accounts themselves do none of those things.

9.   Mr Iqbal seeks to persuade me that they do by referring to the  debtors
    on their current assets.  It seems to me that that argument  is  wholly
    unpersuasive.  Any company that operates will have debtors, being those
    to whom money is to be reclaimed through invoices in the normal  course
    of business. No identification of the debtors have  been  made  in  the
    accounts.  The names of the two claimants are  not  stated  and  it  is
    difficult without more to reconcile the payments made into the business
    with the current assets that are described.  For example in relation to
    the balance sheet as at 30 June 2014 to be found  at  F13  the  current
    assets are expressed as �13,183 of which �1,155 was said to reflect the
    debtors.

10.  In that period, it would seem from the  letter  of  13  February  2015,
    that no investment had been made and so it is difficult to describe the
    debtors as having been the investors.

11.  From the period 1 July 2014 to 5 February 2015 it  is  said  that  some
    �179,000 was invested in  those  accounts  and  the  debtors  share  is
    �162,308. It maybe that some of that debt is indeed from a contribution
    from the claimants but again it has not been itemised as to what  is  a
    debt by way of payment in for investment and what  is  debt  by  monies
    owed from trading.  In  any  event  no  names  are  specified  and  the
    accounts  are  clearly  defective  in  relation  to  certain   of   the
    requirements.

12.  I note that the accounts were prepared by Sarmad  &  Co,  who  produced
    the confirmation of investment letter of 13 February 2015. It may  well
    be that some explanation  or  clarification  can  be  made  as  to  the
    accounts and the investments by those who prepared them.   Prima  facie
    however it seems to me that the challenge  made  by  the  Secretary  of
    State to the accounts is a  proper  one.   Such  a  challenge  deserved
    consideration by the Judge and none was given.

13.  The Judge has proceeded on  the  basis  that  the  bank  statements  as
    submitted show the full amount of investment that was made.  It may  or
    may not be the case but the key the issue was whether  those  documents
    were properly admissible in an application to be considered  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

14.  Ms Brocklesby-Weller submits that in the  context  of  46-SD(a)  it  is
    entirely clear that the only proper route to  establish  investment  is
    the one set out under the Rules.

15.  I find that the failure of the Judge to engage with  the  challenge  to
    the documentation in any way or at all is a material error of law, such
    that the decision should be set aside and remade.  It will  clearly  be
    necessary to rehear matters de  novo  so  that  the  matter  should  be
    remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal in accordance with the  Senior
    President's Practice Directions.

16.  It seems to me that there are a number of findings of  fact  that  need
    to be made which include the following:-

    (1)  Do the unaudited accounts as submitted show the investment in  the
         names of the claimants?

    (2)  If not can such defects be readily cured and if so how?

    (3)  Can the accountants' letter properly be regarded as  part  of  the
         accounts?

    (4)   If  not,  is  it  open  to  the  claimants  to  rely  upon   such
         documentation in the light of the wording of the Rule?

17.  I set the matters out above to be of assistance  but  they  are  by  no
    means the only issues that fall for consideration and argument.   I  do
    not make any directions  as  such  are  a  matter  for  the  First-tier
    Tribunal when seized upon the appeal.



Notice of Decision

The appeal of the Secretary of State for the Home Department is  allowed  to
the extent that the decision of Judge  Oliver  is  set  aside.   The  appeal
falls to be relisted before the First-tier Tribunal on a de novo appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
