                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. There was no application for an anonymity  direction.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction and, in the circumstances,
    I do not make an anonymity direction.

 2. At the outset of the hearing it appeared that  the  appellant  was  not
    legally represented.  She brought with  her  a  friend  who  did  speak
    English, a Dr Stanikzai.  I indicated that I was  content  for  him  to
    assist the appellant.  The appellant told me that  she  did  understand
    English but as it transpired during the hearing she did not  understand
    as well as she thought and at times it was necessary for the friend  to
    interpret what was being said.  I asked them specifically  whether  she
    wanted to continue or whether she wanted to adjourn for  the  provision
    of an interpreter and through her friend she said that they  wanted  to
    continue with the hearing today. I should also add that  the  appellant
    was also escorted by her partner, the sponsor.  In the circumstances  I
    was satisfied that it was appropriate and  consistent  with  overriding
    object to deal with cases fairly and justly to continue  the  error  of
    law hearing, bearing in  mind  that  at  this  stage  the  hearing  was
    confined to submissions,  rather  than  the  taking  of  any  evidence.



 3. This is the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Devlin promulgated on 16 June  2019  dismissing  on  all
    grounds the appellant's appeal against the decision of the Secretary of
    State dated 9 March of 2019 refusing her application made on 3 December
    2018 for leave to remain as the partner of a settled person in the  UK.



 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge Scott-Baker granted permission to  appeal  on
    30 July 2019.  Thus, the matter came before me on 23 September 2019  in
    the Upper Tribunal.

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such as to require Judge  Devlin's  decision  to  be  set  aside.   The
    grounds assert primarily that the judge was incorrect not to have taken
    the sponsor's previous salaried earnings into account on the basis that
    he was not in employment at  the  date  of  application.   It  is  also
    asserted that the sponsor had been credible explaining why the  amounts
    in his bank statement was less than the amounts  declared  in  his  tax
    return.  Thirdly,  it  is  argued  that  the  finding  in  relation  to
    fertility treatment in Afghanistan was  flawed  given  that  the  Upper
    Tribunal  had  accepted  that  such  treatment  was  not  available  in
    Afghanistan and that the appellant and the sponsor  had  no  family  in
    Afghanistan.

 6. Dealing first with the evidence in relation to  financial  eligibility,
    the judge neglected to note that under paragraph 13(e) of Appendix  FM-
    SE that a self-employed person's gross annual  income  equates  to  the
    total of income from all sources in the "last full financial  year"  or
    an "average of the last two full financial years".  Instead, the  judge
    took a different route, concluding that it was possible to look forward
    to the future income of the sponsor and relying on Section  85  of  the
    2002 Act and the sponsor's assertion  that  in  the  current  financial
    year, 2018  /2019,  he  had  earned  �19,103,  and  had  enclosed  some
    documentation in relation to that.

 7. It was argued before the First-tier Tribunal that the appellant now met
    the financial eligibility requirements and therefore the appeal  should
    be allowed.  However, in a  very  long  decision  comprising  some  268
    paragraphs, Judge Devlin concluded that  the  documentary  evidence  to
    support  the  future  income  was  not  present  and  in  nay  e  event
    insufficient to meet the requirements of the Rules.  I need not  detail
    all of that, because it is set out  quite  clearly  in  Judge  Devlin's
    decision.

 8. With regard to paragraph 13(e), the judge may have erred in failing  to
    take into account the previous earnings, being the sponsor's  part-time
    employment salary of �8,970 from the employment  at  a  takeaway  which
    terminated in March of 2018, and his self-employed income  of  �10,040.
    Those two figures, if able to be taken  together,  exceed  the  �18,600
    minimum financial threshold.  On the basis of paragraph  13(e)  it  was
    arguable that those two figures could be taken together, provided  that
    they fell within the last full financial year.  In those circumstances,
    I am satisfied that the judge fell into error.  I am not satisfied that
    he was right in considering a future income under the  Rules.  However,
    whether the judge was right to consider future income or not, and  even
    though the judge was wrong in relation to  failing  to  appreciate  the
    effect of paragraph 13(e) of Appendix FMSE, the fact remains  that  the
    specified documentary evidence required to evidence either the past  or
    the future income was not available.

 9. In essence, the sponsor was paid cash in hand and he was unable to show
    payments into a bank account which matched  any  form  of  income.   It
    would be impossible for the respondent in those circumstances to verify
    the income. The documentary evidence  required  was  not  produced.  It
    follows that the appellant's claim must fail,  even  though  the  judge
    approached it in a legally incorrect way.

10. As far as the issue about the availability of infertility treatment  in
    Afghanistan, the appellant relied on  an  unreported  decision  of  the
    Upper Tribunal, which the judge should not have considered, but it  did
    not in effect assist the appellant.  It remains for  the  appellant  to
    show, in relation to medical treatment,  that  such  treatment  is  not
    available in the country from which she comes.  However,  there  is  no
    evidence to suggest that IVF treatment is not available in Afghanistan.
     Of course, it might be doubtful that IVF was available in Afghanistan,
    but the fact remains it was for the appellant to show that it was  not.
    Today, she told me that she had no such evidence but just  "knew"  that
    it was not available.

11. In any event, I am not satisfied that the issue  of  IVF  treatment  is
    capable of amounting to Article 3 ECHR grounds  outside  the  Rules  or
    even insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing outside the  UK
    in pursuit of paragraph  EX1  under  Appendix  FM.   This  is  not  the
    situation where the appellant has a medical  condition  for  which  she
    will not be able to receive treatment.  Similarly, I am  not  satisfied
    that the wish to  obtain  or  pursue  IVF  treatment  and  its  alleged
    unavailability can amount to compelling circumstances.  It follows that
    I find no error of law in relation to that issue.

12. In the circumstances, although, as I have stated, the  judge  proceeded
    on an incorrect legal basis with reference to  the  requirements  under
    Appendix FM-SE, the appeal was doomed to failure from the outset.   The
    Rules could not be met, and there was nothing  compelling  outside  the
    Rules to justify granting leave on the basis that  the  decision  would
    otherwise be unjustifiably harsh.

13. It remains open to the appellant to make a further application,  taking
    care to demonstrate that the application  is  accompanied  by  all  the
    relevant legal evidential requirements.  They are  quite  complex,  and
    the appellant may be best assisted by a legal representative.

14. It follows from the above that I find no error of law in  the  impugned
    decision.

Decision

15. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.



No anonymity direction is made.
