                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Tampuri, OISC Level 2 representative at Tamsons
                    Legal Services
For the Respondent:    Mr Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DECISION AND REASONS (V)

UPON the parties agreeing with the following

a) The decision of the FTT promulgated on 25 October 2019, after  a  hearing
on 22 October 2019, should be set aside pursuant to rule 43 of the  Tribunal
Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as amended) ('the Procedure  Rules').
 This is because the notice of the FTT  hearing  was  not  received  by  the
appellant or his representatives and the hearing proceeded  in  the  absence
of the appellant.  In the circumstances the conditions  in  rule  43(a)  and
(c) are met and it is in the interests to set aside the FTT decision.

b) None of the FTT's findings of fact are preserved.

c) The matter should be remitted to the FTT.

AND UPON  the  Tribunal  considering  in  these  circumstances  that  it  is
appropriate to set aside the  FTT  decision  pursuant  to  rule  43  of  the
Procedure Rules and to remit the matter to the FTT

IT IS ORDERED BY CONSENT:

The decision of the FTT is set aside.

The matter is remitted to the FTT to a judge other than FTTJ Mill.
