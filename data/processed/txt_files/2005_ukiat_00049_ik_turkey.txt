                             DECISION ON APPEAL

  This is an appeal from a decision of an adjudicator (Mr PM Petherbridge),
  sitting at Taylor House on 20 November 2003,  allowing  an  appeal  by  a
  Kurdish citizen of Turkey, on human rights grounds  only.  Permission  to
  appeal was given on the basis that the  adjudicator's  conclusions  might
  not reflect the current state of the law on  ill-health:  the  claimant's
  problems are mental ones, which led him to threaten to kill himself.

2. The adjudicator's main findings were these (see his �� 63-64):

    a. I am satisfied on the medical evidence before me that, at least,  for
       the present time it would be unsafe for this Appellant to be returned
       to Turkey.

    b. I do not consider the Appellant's medical condition  and  the  effect
       upon him [of] being  returned  to  Turkey  sufficient  to  engage  an
       Article 3 claim.

    c. However ... I do consider that this is  'one  of  those  rare  cases'
       where  removal  would  not  be  proportional  to  the  interests   of
       immigration control because of the threat to the Appellant's physical
       and moral integrity ... for the following reasons:


        i. Two psychiatrists have said he is suicidal; and
       ii. He manifested signs of extreme anxiety at his Tribunal [sc.  the
           adjudicator] hearing that satisfied me that he was mentally ill;
           and
      iii. ... he has convinced himself of the truth of  his  asylum  claim
           (although I do not accept it as true) and ... perceives he  will
           be tortured if returned to Turkey; and
       iv. I do not believe from the medical  evidence  available  that  he
           would,  at  present,  have  the  ability  to  cope  with  social
           relationships  and  pursue  normal  activities  if  returned  to
           Turkey; and
        v. Now that he is undergoing treatment in this country,  which  his
           Consultant  Psychiatrist  is  cautiously  optimistic   will   be
           successful within 3- 6 months, the risk of more potential damage
           being caused to him  by  an  enforced  return  would  be  wholly
           disproportionate to the need to maintain immigration control.

3. These conclusions were challenged by the Home  Office  in  very  general
   terms, relying on the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in
   Bensaid v United Kingdom (2001) 33 EHRR 205 and the Court of  Appeal  in
   Ullah (now overtaken by Ullah [2004] UKHL 26, and, more significantly in
   this context, Razgar [2004] UKHL 27) and Djali [2003] EWCA Civ 1371. The
   position specifically on suicide had been dealt with  by  the  Court  of
   Appeal in Soumahoro [2003] EWCA  840, which  was  not  appealed  to  the
   House of Lords. While what they said there[1] has  to  be  read  in  the
   light of the general statement of principle in Razgar,  we  think  there
   must still be a need to consider the difference in any risk  of  suicide
   (and what there is to protect against it)  in  the  destination  country
   over and above here, since it is the consequences of removal which  form
   the basis of any asylum and human rights appeal.

4. Miss Shah tried, we thought quite artificially, to limit  the  ambit  of
   the appeal in various ways. There was for example a  specific  challenge
   to the adjudicator for failing to have regard to  "the  availability  of
   medical  treatment  in  Turkey  for  the   appellant".   Certainly   the
   adjudicator did not deal in any way with the evidence about that in  the
   CIPU report before  him,  or  from  any  other  source;  but  Miss  Shah
   suggested that, since she had not relied before him  on  any  difference
   between medical services in Turkey and here, he did not have  to  review
   the evidence on that point at all; and that, since there might have been
   a risk of the claimant's killing himself, either  on  hearing  the  news
   that he was to be removed, or in the course of removal, the  failure  to
   review medical services in Turkey was in any case not  material  to  the
   risk he found.

5. This line of argument seemed to us to fly  in  the  face  of   what  the
   adjudicator himself said (see i), ii) and iii) c-d  above)  specifically
   about the consequences of  return to Turkey. The  adjudicator  at  least
   appreciated that this was what the appeal was about: particularly as  at
   the date of the decision the right of appeal  was  against  the  removal
   directions, rather than the decision to remove itself, as  now.  He  did
   not even suggest that the appeal fell to be  allowed  on  the  basis  of
   anything the claimant might try to do to himself  while  still  in  this
   country, or in transit to Turkey. Given  that  even  a  suicidal  person
   might not be expected to see all hope  as  lost  before  actually  being
   taken away, and that any  period  in  detention  and  transit  would  be
   undertaken under close observation, it would have been difficult for the
   adjudicator to do so. However neither can he be blamed for  not  trying,
   nor his decision be supported on a basis he never sought to give for it.

6. The medical evidence before the adjudicator showed, as  is  usually  the
   case, that its authors saw a risk of suicide for  the  claimant  on  the
   basis of their expert opinion as to his  condition.  Though  one  was  a
   general practitioner, rather than  a  psychiatrist  as  the  adjudicator
   suggested, there is no question but that he  was  entitled  to  rely  on
   their evidence in this respect. However it was not, and could not be the
   whole story. For a suicide risk, as with any other risk  for  which  the
   authorities of the country in question are not directly responsible,  to
   raise an arguable breach of human rights, it  must  be  a  risk  against
   which they are unable or unwilling to provide effective protection.

7. There is of course  difficulty  in  guarding  someone  against  his  own
   propensity to self-destruction,  even  by  regular  watching  round  the
   clock, as the unfortunate number of suicides in custody,  even  in  this
   country, makes clear. However, many people are protected  against  self-
   harm by medical or similar treatment, as this claimant  has  been  here;
   and the question had to arise as to why that could  not  happen  on  his
   eventual return to Turkey. There was nothing  in  the  medical  evidence
   before the adjudicator to deal with that question, and he did not try to
   do so from any other source.

8. Given what was said in Razgar on this point[2], we do not  think  it  is
   open to Miss Shah to defend the adjudicator's decision on the basis that
   it was open to him on nothing more than  a  general  assessment  of  the
   proportionality of return. To allow that would be to  give  adjudicators
   (and the appellate authorities generally)  a  subjective  discretion  in
   such cases not recognized in Razgar (and  specifically  excluded  in  DM
   (Croatia) CG* [2004] UKIAT 00024, the leading decision  on  this  point,
   which required the claimant to show that no  reasonable  Home  Secretary
   could have insisted on removal - though we do not base our  decision  on
   that case, as its correctness is currently under  consideration  by  the
   Court of Appeal).

9. There is the  added  difficulty  for  Miss  Shah  that  the  adjudicator
   specifically excluded any article 3 risk (see  i)  above).  He  gave  no
   reason for that, but it implies that he saw no real risk on the evidence
   before him  of  the  claimant  killing  himself  on  return  to  Turkey;
   otherwise it is hard to see why sending him back there  would  not  have
   infringed both article 3 and article 2 of the Human  Rights  Convention.
   It leaves the adjudicator's decision supportable only on  the  basis  of
   some lesser risk, not reaching the minimum level of severity for article
   3, and there is nothing before us to show why such a risk in  this  case
   should reach the exceptional level required for  one  of  this  kind  to
   succeed, or for questions of proportionality to come into play: see 8.

10. We had before us the decisions of the Tribunal in P (Yugoslavia)  [2003]
   UKIAT 00017 and KK (Serbia and Montenegro) [2004] UKIAT 00228.  In  both
   those cases the Tribunal were dealing  with  decisions  of  adjudicators
   issued before � 101 of the 2002 Act came into force on 9 June  2003,  so
   were entitled to, and did adopt the Subesh [2004] EWCA 56  approach  and
   consider the facts for  themselves.  We  commend  the  approach  of  the
   Tribunal in both those cases to adjudicators dealing with similar  ones.
   However we have not been told of any similar case which has come  before
   a Tribunal restricted by the authoritative interpretation of � 101 in CA
   [2004] EWCA Civ 1165 to considering whether there has been an  error  of
   law.[3]

11. These are the questions which we think  the  law  requires  adjudicators
   considering such cases to ask themselves:

    a) On the individual medical evidence relating to the claimant, is there
       a real risk of him trying to kill himself on return to his country of
       origin, significantly over and above any  such  risk  if  allowed  to
       remain in this country?

    b) On the background evidence  relating  to  medical  services  in  that
       country (and any other relevant evidence), would  he  be  effectively
       protected against his own actions in that way (bearing  in  mind  the
       obvious difficulties involved, also found in this country: see 7)?

   Only if the answer to a) is 'yes', and b) 'no' will there be  any  scope
   for allowing the appeal under article 3  (or  2)  of  the  Human  Rights
   Convention; but, if those are the right answers, it is hard to  see  how
   such a case would not meet the minimum level of  severity  required  for
   article 3.

12. On the other hand, if either question a) is to be answered 'no',  or  b)
   'yes', then the claim can only succeed on the basis that  return,  while
   not putting the claimant at any real increased risk of killing  herself,
   would nevertheless amount to what Lord Carswell described in Razgar  (at
   � 72) as an exceptional engagement of article 8, on the basis  that  the
   claimant has shown "... a very grave state of affairs,  amounting  to  a
   flagrant  or  fundamental  breach  of  the  article,  which  in   effect
   constitutes a complete denial of his rights" in respect of  preservation
   of his mental stability. This must be an exceptional case indeed, and in
   our view must inevitably involve consideration in depth of the available
   background evidence on medical services  in  the  country  in  question,
   rather than mere reliance on  assessments  of  an  individual,  made  by
   practitioners in this  country,  who  cannot  normally  be  regarded  as
   experts on conditions overseas.

13. If this case is seen in terms of anything short of a suicide risk,  then
   the only exceptional thing about it is the  strong  personal  impression
   made by the claimant on the adjudicator: see his finding at c) ii),  set
   out at 2. While the adjudicator certainly could not be regarded  as  any
   kind of expert on mental illness, he was entitled, given that there  was
   some expert evidence before him, to record the personal impression  made
   on him by the claimant in the course of the hearing, and, to an  extent,
   to rely on it.

14. In this case, as we have already made clear, the adjudicator went  wrong
   in law by failing to consider:

   a) any differential risk of suicide on return [at least in terms, though
      arguably his decision shows he did have this in mind];
   b) whether or not effective protection would be  available  against  any
      such risk;   and
   c) whether any lesser risk to the claimant's  mental  health  on  return
      would amount to a "flagrant or fundamental breach"  of  his  right  to
      private life.

   It follows that we should be entitled to try to reach our  own  view  on
   the facts of the case, on these points (not restricted, even in   Subesh
   terms, on b) and c), since they were never  considered  at  all  by  the
   adjudicator).

15. The difficulty with that, just  as  where  an  adjudicator  has  made  a
   credibility finding on oral evidence, is that it is very hard for us  to
   know what ought  to  be  made  of   Mr  Petherbridge's  finding  on  the
   claimant's mental state before him (see 2 c) ii)), without  having  seen
   the claimant give evidence for ourselves. The claimant ought not  to  be
   deprived of all benefit of such a finding;  and  a  further  adjudicator
   hearing seems inevitable. Miss Shah argued that the case should go  back
   to Mr Petherbridge, so that he could rely on the  findings  he  made  in
   November 2003, without putting  the  claimant  through  the  anguish  of
   giving evidence again.

16. To mention the date of the original hearing is in  our  view  enough  to
   show that this ought not to happen. It  would  be  hard  enough  for  Mr
   Petherbridge to  disentangle  the  views  he  reached  then  from  those
   required by whatever the current state of affairs turns out to  be;  and
   next to impossible if he had to balance  with  the  current  evidence  a
   personal impression made well over a year ago. We have no doubt that the
   case ought to go back to another adjudicator.

17. While AB [2004] UKIAT 00323 makes it clear that we have no formal  power
   under the Procedure Rules to limit the scope of remittal  (though  there
   is such a power under � 102.4a of the 2002 Act),  it  makes  it  equally
   clear that we can and should say, not only, as  we  have,  why  we  have
   dealt with the case in that way; but, as  we  now  do,  what  the  fresh
   adjudicator needs to focus on.



18. In our view, so long as there has been  no  significant  change  in  the
   relevant circumstances, the further hearing we direct should be entirely
   concerned with consideration of the points set out at 11 and  12  above.
   If the claimant's medical advisers consider him unfit to give  evidence,
   then evidence from them must be filed and served in accordance with  the
   standard directions, and will no doubt be taken fully  into  account  in
   deciding his current mental state (rather than the one he  presented  in
   November 2003). Failing that, the adjudicator will be entitled to expect
   to hear from the claimant personally, and not to allow  reliance  to  be
   placed on what by then may well be an out-of-date personal impression of
   Mr Petherbridge's.

[1] (at � 85) "If it was arguable on the evidence  that  there  was  a  real
risk of a significantly increased risk that, if she were removed to  France,
the appellant would commit suicide, then in our  view  her  claim  based  on
article 3 could not be certified as manifestly unfounded."

lawful operation of immigration control will be proportionate in all save  a
small minority of exceptional cases, identifiable only on  a  case  by  case
basis"; and see also per Lord Carswell at � 72, cited at 12.
[3] SN [2004] UKIAT 00053 (not cited to  us)  is  in  our  view  a  valuable
decision as to what is required in the way  of  medical  evidence.  However,
while there are a number of references in it to "error of law  on  the  part
of the adjudicator", whose decision is likely not  to  have  been  sent  out
till after 8 June 2003, CA was still to come,  and  the  current  restricted
nature of the Tribunal's jurisdiction had not yet become fully apparent.
