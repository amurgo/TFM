Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms L Gardner, Counsel, instructed by Migrant Legal
     Project (Cardiff)
For the Respondent:    Mr C Howells, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, a national of Iran,  has  permission  to  challenge  the
    decision of Judge Clemes of the First-tier Tribunal (FtT) posted on  21
    February 2018 dismissing his appeal against the decision  made  by  the
    respondent on 14 December 2017 refusing his protection claim.

2.   The appellant's two grounds aver that the  judge  materially  erred  in
    law in:

    (1)  making a material mistake  of  fact  as  regards  the  appellant's
         evidence of whether he had carried on  openly  engaging  in  cross-
         border trading with his father in the one and a half to  two  weeks
         before he left Iran; and


    (2)  failing to properly apply the Joint Presidential Guidance Note No.
         2 of 2010 on vulnerable witnesses.

3.   I consider ground 1 is made out.  Mr Howells  accepts  that  the  judge
    wrongly recorded the appellant's evidence at paragraph 9.  At paragraph
    9 the judge stated:

         "The appellant was cross examined by Ms Lewis, having been reminded
         of his option to take a break as and when he needed one.   He  said
         that he had last had contact with his family 1-1� weeks before.  He
         did not know if there had been contact between his family  and  the
         Iranian authorities.  His father would not tell him.   He  had  not
         asked his father  to  forward  the  threatening  letters.   He  was
         unaware of what had happened to them.  He had worked  for  five  or
         six months transporting goods.  His identity card had been lawfully
         issued.  His  father  had  obtained  it  for  him.   The  pata  was
         different for each load transported.  That would be handed over the
         authorities.  If there was no pata, he would not  be  let  through.
         If it was too busy, he might not need to show his identity card and
         just show the pata.  He had never had problems crossing the border.
          He had never worked for the gang before  and  had  referred  their
         request to his father.  He would  have  liked  to  do  it  as  they
         offered a lot of money but his father refused to let him.   He  had
         not been told  explicitly  that  they  were  moving  drugs  but  he
         presumed this from the amount of money being offered.   His  father
         still undertakes work as a trader, he said, and  both  he  and  his
         father did it whilst the gang were issuing the threatening letters.
          He denied that this meant that he was unlikely to be  at  risk  on
         return.  His father was telling him that he (his father)  would  be
         in a difficult position if he was returned.  His  father  had  also
         told him that loads were being passed through by the  gang  without
         papers being shown.  He repeated that had  never  worked  for  this
         gang before.  Other than the letters, there were no  other  threats
         issued.  He did not know if his father saw the gang  now.   He  was
         asked why he had waited until ten letters had been received  before
         he left: he said that he had hoped that the gang would "back off"."

4.   In fact the evidence the appellant gave in reply  to  cross-examination
    - as was accepted by Mr Howells - was that as soon as he  informed  his
    father that he had been approached by a gang, his  father  forbade  him
    from continuing his trade at the border.

5.   Mr Howells submitted that whilst paragraph 9 was  an  incorrect  record
    of the appellant's evidence this did not give rise to a material  error
    since on his own account he  had  not  gone  into  hiding  during  this
    period.   Ms  Gardner  disagreed.   The  paragraph  in  contention   is
    paragraph 23(e) wherein the judge said:

         "The appellant was said by Ms Gardner to be  less  likely  to  have
         fabricated his claim when he easily could have done so.  I  am  not
         satisfied that his claim that the gang were in some  undefined  way
         linked to Etelaat or the Iranian security services in some way.   I
         am satisfied that he had added this to his  claim  to  enhance  his
         claim to persecution on the basis  of  imputed  political  opinion.
         Without it, such a claim has little traction.  The difficulty  with
         his account is this: his father - a cross-border  trader  like  the
         appellant himself, I am satisfied - has carried on trading  in  the
         appellant's absence without  apparent  difficulty.   This  -  I  am
         satisfied - would be most unlikely if the appellant had crossed the
         Iranian security services.  The same problem shows itself with  the
         delay - whether it is 1�  weeks  or  2  weeks  that  the  appellant
         delayed his departure and (I find) carried on openly  trading.   If
         he was in such peril, then it might be expected that the  appellant
         would have gone into hiding or to have fled.   As  it  stands,  his
         account is that he was threatened with 10 letters over  a  week  or
         two and carried on trading.  Furthermore, his father has managed to
         do so without issues.   I  am  satisfied  the  appellant  has  done
         exactly what Ms Gardner submitted he had avoided doing: embellished
         his claim.  I am satisfied that there was  no  involvement  by  the
         security services of Iran and no link whatsoever from them  to  the
         traders operating on the border proximate to the appellant's home."

6.   Mr Howells pointed out that at paragraph 19 of  his  witness  statement
    the appellant had acknowledged that he remained in his village  in  the
    one and a half weeks to two weeks after the gang  had  approached  him.
    Consequently, he submitted, the judge's assessment, that "[i]f  he  was
    in such peril, then it might be expected that the appellant would  have
    gone into hiding or to have fled", was unaffected.

7.   I am unable to accept that the judge's mistake of fact was  immaterial.
     Whilst the appellant's statement does not  refer  to  him  going  into
    hiding during  the  relevant  period,  it  was  clearly  of  particular
    importance to the judge that the appellant "carried on trading" - which
    was  not  in  fact  the  appellant's  evidence.   Furthermore,  on  the
    appellant's evidence he was staying at his house during this time which
    was gated and the evidence was unclear regarding whether the gang would
    have seen fit to attack the appellant in his house whilst still sending
    threatening letters (at Q78 the appellant had said "my father  did  not
    let me go out as they want to harm me ...").

8.   As regards ground (2), I do not consider it has force on its  own.   At
    paragraph 24 the judge stated:

         "I remind myself that the appellant was a child when he came to the
         UK and still is and that I must look at him through the  filter  of
         his age.  However, I also take into account that he was towards the
         upper limit of the definition of a child's age (15) when he arrived
         in the UK and gave his asylum interview and statement  of  evidence
         when he was 17.  I am satisfied that  the  inconsistencies  evident
         from his account are not attributable  to  his  age.   He  gave  an
         account which showed knowledge  of  the  practice  of  cross-border
         trading:  the  problem  arises  because  the  appellant  has   been
         inconsistent in parts of the fundamental  problem  that  it  is  an
         implausible claim at its heart."

9.   The 2010 Guidance does not require judges  to  disregard  discrepancies
    in a vulnerable person's evidence, only to consider the extent to which
    the age or  vulnerability  of  the  witness  was  an  element  of  that
    discrepancy (see paragraph 14 and also paragraph 3).   I  am  satisfied
    the judge did give such consideration in all relevant respects, save as
    regards assessing the appellant's evidence concerning his delay of  one
    and a half to two weeks in leaving Iran. Whilst that was because of the
    judge's failure to understand the  appellant's  evidence  correctly,  I
    cannot exclude that the judge may not have given due  consideration  to
    it consistent with the 2010 guidance had he understood it correctly.

10.  I do not intend by this decision to suggest in any  way  the  appellant
    is entitled to succeed in his appeal - in my view the judge  identified
    a number of other significant shortcomings  in  his  account  -  but  I
    cannot exclude that he may have viewed matters differently had  he  not
    incorrectly recorded and  understood  the  appellant's  evidence  about
    carrying on as a trader after allegedly receiving threats from a gang.

11.  For the above reasons:

     The decision of the FtT judge is set aside for material error of law.

     The case is remitted to the FtT.  Although  no  findings  of  fact  are
    preserved, the next judge  may  consider  that  Judge  Clemes  properly
    identified significant shortcomings in the appellant's  evidence  (save
    for the issue regarding the appellant's delay in  leaving  Iran)  which
    have not been satisfactorily explained so far.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
