Anonymity

    Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008, I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal or  a  Court
    directs otherwise, no report  of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
    publication thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the Appellant
    or members of  his/her  family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst
    others, all parties. Any failure to comply with  this  direction  could
    give rise to contempt of court proceedings.




                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is the remaking of  the  decision  in  this  appeal  following  my
    previous decision, promulgated on 18 September 2019,  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal materially erred in law when allowing V T's appeal.

 2. Although it was the Secretary  of  State  who  appealed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, at this stage of proceedings it is now appropriate  to  refer
    to V T once more as the appellant, and to the Secretary of State as the
    respondent.

 3. This appeal concerns two principal issues. First,  has  the  respondent
    shown  that  the  appellant  is  no  longer  a  refugee   because   the
    circumstances in connection with which he had been recognised  as  such
    have  ceased  to  exist?  (the  cessation  issue).   Second,   is   the
    respondent's decision to refuse the appellant's human rights  claim  on
    the basis that  he  is  a  foreign  national  criminal  and  should  be
    deported, unlawful, with reference to Article 8 ECHR and section  6  of
    the Human Rights Act 1998? (the deportation issue).

Background

 4. The appellant is a national of Vietnam, born on 25 October 1955. It  is
    not entirely clear when he left that country, but it is  common  ground
    that he arrived in Malaysia in February 1989, whereupon he  resided  in
    what was very probably a refugee camp catering for compatriots who  had
    also fled the regime as members  of  the  cohort  referred  to  as  the
    "Vietnamese boat people". The appellant came to the United  Kingdom  on
    19 June 1991. The precise basis upon which this occurred is a matter to
    which I will return: was he a refugee in his own  right,  or  what  his
    entry by way solely of a family reunion policy (the appellant's brother
    had already come to the United Kingdom and was a refugee)? Once in this
    country, the appellant was granted indefinite  leave  to  remain  as  a
    refugee on 29 January 1992. His wife and children  subsequently  joined
    him here under a family reunion policy.

 5. Over the course of his lengthy residence in  the  United  Kingdom,  the
    appellant has accrued the following convictions:

              a) 6 March 1997: driving a motor vehicle with excess  alcohol,
                 fined �200 and disqualified from driving for 3 years;

              b) 2 November  2001:  driving  a  motor  vehicle  with  excess
                 alcohol,   sentenced   to   60   days'   imprisonment   and
                 disqualified for 4 years;

              c) 15 August 2005: conspiracy  to  produce  a  Class  C  drug,
                 namely cannabis  (my  error  of  law  decision  erroneously
                 referred to "Class B drugs"). On 13 February 2006,  he  was
                 sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment;

              d) 20 June 2011: driving a motor vehicle with excess  alcohol,
                 given a 12 month community order (with a 260  hours  unpaid
                 work requirement) and disqualified for 40 months.

 6. On 4 October 2016, the appellant was served with two notices: the first
    was a decision to deport, with reference to the UK  Borders  Act  2007;
    the second related  to  notification  of  intention  to  cease  refugee
    status, with  specific  reference  to  Article  1C(5)  of  the  Refugee
    Convention ("the Convention") and paragraph 339A(v) of the  Immigration
    Rules ("the Rules"). The next action taken by the respondent was by way
    of a decision to deport, dated 22 April 2018.  However,  this  decision
    was subsequently withdrawn on the  basis  that  it  relied  on  the  UK
    Borders Act 2007, which had not been  in  force  at  the  time  of  the
    relevant conviction and sentence relating to the drugs offence. It took
    the respondent another relatively substantial period of time to issue a
    legally correct decision to  deport  on  30  January  2019,  this  time
    relying solely on section 3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act  1971.  On  13
    March 2019, the respondent  issued  a  "cessation  of  refugee  status"
    decision letter, again relying on Article 1C(5) of the  Convention  and
    paragraph 339A(v) of the Rules. On the same date, the respondent made a
    decision to refuse the appellant's human rights claim, which  had  been
    constituted by a series of representations submitted in 2016 and  2018.
    These last two decisions were both appealable.

 7. In allowing the appellant's appeal, the First-tier Tribunal essentially
    concluded as follows. First, that the respondent  had  failed  to  show
    that there had been a sufficiently significant and  durable  change  in
    the nature of the Vietnamese government since the appellant  left  that
    country, and that  the  respondent  failed  to  undertake  verification
    checks in respect of any potential risk to  the  appellant  on  return.
    Second, that  the  respondent's  delay  in  taking  deportation  action
    against the appellant was such that it outweighed the public interest.

 8. My error of law decision is appended  to  this  remaking  decision.  In
    summary, I found that the judge had failed to adopt  an  individualised
    approach to  the  cessation  issue,  focusing  instead  simply  on  the
    objective aspect (in other  words,  the  human  rights  record  of  the
    government).  There  had   been   a   misunderstanding   as   to   what
    "verification" meant in respect of a cessation case. Finally,  although
    the delay issue was clearly relevant, the judge  had  failed  to  other
    material  factors  such  as  deterrence  and  public  confidence   when
    undertaking the Article 8 balancing exercise.

The respondent's case in summary

 9. The respondent asserts that the appellant came to  the  United  Kingdom
    solely on the basis of family reunion, and that he did  not  have,  and
    currently does not have, any political profile that might place him  at
    risk  from  the  Vietnamese  authorities.  On  the  basis  of   country
    information cited in the cessation decision letter of 13 March 2019, it
    is said that the situation in Vietnam has  "fundamentally  and  durably
    changed" since the appellant  left  in  1989.  It  is  noted  that  the
    appellant had made four visits to Vietnam over the course of time,  and
    this was indicative of an absence of risk to him in that country.

10. In respect of Article 8, it is said that the  appellant  is  unable  to
    meet any of the relevant Rules. He separated from  his  wife,  and  his
    current partner, also a Vietnamese  national,  has  no  status  in  the
    United Kingdom. The appellant children are all adults, and there is  no
    evidence of particular dependency. The appellant is not more than  half
    of his life in this country and would, in  all  the  circumstances,  be
    able to reintegrate into Vietnamese society. There are said  to  be  no
    very  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those  set  out   in
    paragraphs 399-33A of the Rules and section  117C(4)  and  (5)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002,  as  amended  ("the  2002
    Act").

The appellant's case in summary

11.  On  the  basis  of  the  representations  submitted  over  time,   the
    appellant's three witness statements, and his oral evidence, he asserts
    that there had been a personalised risk to him when he left Vietnam: he
    had been imprisoned by the regime on two occasions and held anti-regime
    beliefs. Whilst he has  not  been  politically  active  in  the  United
    Kingdom, he still holds anti-regime beliefs. This  would  be  the  case
    upon return to Vietnam. He would not dare to express those  beliefs  on
    return due to the risk of being targeted as  a  result.  The  appellant
    asserts that the Vietnamese regime continues to have a very poor  human
    rights record. The visits to Vietnam are explained by way of  important
    family occasions (including his father's funeral) and that these events
    do not show that he would be safe.

12. As to Article 8, the Appellant asserts that the time  spent  away  from
    Vietnam,  the  ties  established  in  the  United  Kingdom,  and,  most
    importantly, the  respondent's  delay  in  taking  deportation  action,
    combine to significantly reduce the public interest and tip the balance
    in his favour.

The law

13. The relevant legal provisions are well-known, and I do not  propose  to
    rehearse their content in full. It suffices  to  set  out  the  primary
    materials.

14. Article 1A(2) of the Refugee Convention states:

           "A. For  the  purposes  of  the  present  Convention,  the  term
           "refugee" shall apply to any person who:

           ...

           (2) [...] owing to well-founded fear  of  being  persecuted  for
           reasons  of  race,  religion,  nationality,  membership   of   a
           particular social group or political  opinion,  is  outside  the
           country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear,
           is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that  country
           ..."

15. Article 1C(5) of the Convention states (insofar  as  relevant  to  this
    appeal):

           "C. This Convention shall cease to apply to any  person  falling
           under the terms of section A if:

           ...

           (5) He can no longer, because  the  circumstances  in  connexion
           with which he has been recognised as a refugee  have  ceased  to
           exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection  of
           his country of nationality; ..."

16. Paragraph 339(v) of the Rules reflects Article 1C(5).

17. Section 117C of the  2002  Act  reads  (insofar  as  relevant  to  this
    appeal):

           "117C Article 8: additional considerations  in  cases  involving
           foreign criminals

           (1) The deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
           interest.

           (2)  The  more  serious  the  offence  committed  by  a  foreign
           criminal, the greater is the public interest in  deportation  of
           the criminal.

           (3) In the case of a foreign criminal ("C")  who  has  not  been
           sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the
           public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception  1  or
           Exception 2 applies.

           (4) Exception 1 applies where-

           (a) C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for  most
           of C's life,

           (b) C is  socially  and  culturally  integrated  in  the  United
           Kingdom, and

           (c) there would be very significant obstacles to C's integration
           into the country to which C is proposed to be deported.

           (5) Exception 2 applies where C has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
           relationship  with  a  qualifying  partner,  or  a  genuine  and
           subsisting parental relationship with a  qualifying  child,  and
           the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child  would  be
           unduly harsh.

           (6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced  to
           a period of imprisonment of at  least  four  years,  the  public
           interest requires deportation unless there are  very  compelling
           circumstances, over and above those described  in  Exceptions  1
           and 2."

18. Section 117C(6) also applies to those who have been sentenced  to  less
    than four years but are unable to satisfy either of the two exceptions.

19. Paragraphs 398-399A of the Rules essentially reflect section 117C.

The evidence

20. By way of documentary evidence, I have considered the contents  of  the
    respondent's original appeal bundle and the appellant's recently served
    consolidated bundle, indexed and paginated 1-N16. It  is  to  be  noted
    that the UNHCR letter contained in  the  respondent's  and  appellant's
    bundle is apparently incomplete. It has not been possible to acquire  a
    full copy, but, in the circumstances, neither party suggested that this
    should prevent the appeal from being determined on the basis of what is
    before me.

21. The appellant and his brother, Mr V S T, attended the hearing and  gave
    oral evidence with the assistance of a Vietnamese interpreter.  A  full
    note of their evidence is contained in the record of proceedings.

22. The appellant adopted his three witness statements. He told me that  he
    did not like the communist regime in Vietnam.  He  would  not  dare  to
    express any  anti-regime  news  if  in  that  country  because  of  the
    consequences. He had attended a single demonstration in  this  country,
    in the year 2000, against  a  group  of  Vietnamese  singers  whom  the
    appellant regarded as being pro-regime. The appellant said that  if  in
    Vietnam, he would want to be involved in an anti-regime group. Overall,
    the appellant told me that he did not like Vietnamese people  who  were
    in favour of the regime. The only relative in  Vietnam  that  he  knows
    about is a nephew, but he has had no contact with this individual since
    2011. The appellant told me that he no longer drinks alcohol  and  that
    his health is "OK".

23. The appellant's brother confirmed that  he  and  his  family  had  lost
    everything to the communist regime in Vietnam. He told me that  he  did
    not like the regime. He believed that the appellant held the same anti-
    regime views as himself. He did not believe that he  could  assist  the
    appellant financially if the  latter  returned  to  Vietnam.  This  was
    because the witness only work  part-time  and  has  three  children  to
    support. There was rare  communication  with  a  nephew  who  lives  in
    Vietnam.

The representatives' submissions

24. At the outset, Mr Bramble expressly stated that the respondent was  not
    asserting that the appellant had never been a refugee.  This  statement
    was made in response to a concerned raised by Mr Uddin  in  respect  of
    what is said in [84]-[90] of JS (Uganda) [2019] EWCA Civ  1670.  There,
    the Secretary of State had sought to withdraw a  concession  which  had
    accepted that JS had been a refugee. The Court of Appeal permitted  the
    concession  to  be  withdrawn.  In  the  present   case,   Mr   Bramble
    acknowledged that the position he has adopted means that the  Appellant
    had been a refugee.

25. Mr Bramble relied on his skeleton argument. In response to an  issue  I
    had raised in my error of law decision, Mr Bramble submitted  that  the
    case of Dang (Refugee - query revocation - Article 3)  [2013]  UKUT  43
    (IAC) has no impact  in  this  appeal  because  the  respondent  always
    intended to revoke the appellant's refugee status in light  of  Article
    1C(5) of the Convention, and not solely under the Rules. In respect  of
    the claim that the appellant's family had had all of their property and
    land confiscated, Mr  Bramble  acknowledged  that  it  appeared  to  be
    plausible, given the history of the Vietnamese regime. However, it  was
    submitted that the appellant had no political profile in his own right.
    There had been no relevant  activity  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  Mr
    Bramble did not accept that the appellant would seek to protest against
    the regime if returned to Vietnam. The fact of the four  visits  showed
    that the authorities had no active interest in  the  appellant.  On  an
    individualised approach, the objective position was  that  the  regimes
    approach to people like the appellant had  significantly  changed,  and
    from a subjective perspective, the appellant had no  real  interest  in
    anti-regime political activism.

26. As to Article 8, Mr Bramble emphasised the high threshold of the  "very
    compelling circumstances" test. He accepted that the respondent's delay
    was relevant, but emphasised the appellant's inability to meet  any  of
    the Rules and the absence of any genuine medical issues.

27. Mr Uddin relied on his skeleton argument. He too  submitted  that  Dang
    has no real application in this case. This is  because  the  particular
    basis of cessation relied on by the respondent was  not  considered  in
    that case and in any event there is no material difference between  the
    basis of cessation under the Convention and revocation under the Rules.

28. In acknowledging  the  need  for  an  individualised  approach  to  the
    cessation issue, Mr Uddin submitted that  the  objective  circumstances
    relating to the country in question was a  more  weighty  consideration
    than the circumstances relating solely to the  appellant.  The  country
    information relied on by the respondent in this case (contained in  the
    letters dated 4 October 2016 and 13 March  2019)  was  insufficient  to
    discharge the burden of proof. I was also referred to pages 81  and  85
    of  the  appellant's  bundle.  In  terms   of   the   appellant's   own
    circumstances, Mr Uddin relied on the fact of  two  imprisonments,  the
    genuine anti-regime beliefs held, and the unwillingness to express such
    beliefs on return only because of the consequences  of  doing  so.  The
    fact of the visits  did  not  show  that  there  was  no  risk  to  the
    appellant.

29. Both representatives accepted that I was entitled to look at the latest
    Fact Finding Mission undertaken by the respondent in February and March
    2019, with the consequent report being published on 9  September  2019.
    At the hearing I was specifically directed to pages 29 and  30  of  the
    report. Mr Bramble also referred me to page 9  of  the  Country  Policy
    Information Note entitled "Vietnam: Opposition to the State", published
    by the respondent in September 2018.

30. On Article 8, Mr Uddin  submitted  that  the  appellant  would  not  be
    considered an insider if he returned to  Vietnam  now.  There  were  no
    meaningful familial ties in that country, and the appellant himself had
    nothing there by way of assets. In addition, the registration system in
    Vietnam meant that the appellant would probably  be  unable  to  access
    amenities and essential services. In  respect  of  his  offending,  the
    appellant was not persistent and represented a very low risk now. He is
    socially and culturally integrated in this country. What was  described
    as the "egregious" delay in this case meant that the  important  public
    interest in deportation was "entirely diluted". The  deterrence  factor
    was also undermined by the delay.

Findings of primary fact

31. Before turning to my conclusions on the relevant issues in this appeal,
    I need to make a number of factual findings. Some of  these  are  based
    upon common ground between the parties, whilst others  are  contentious
    (at least to the extent that they are not expressly agreed).

32. It is clear that the appellant did travel from Vietnam to  Malaysia  at
    some point. It is likely that this occurred relatively  shortly  before
    his arrival in the latter country in February 1989.  I  find  that  the
    appellant's brother had made his own way to  the  United  Kingdom,  was
    recognised as a refugee here, and  duly  granted  indefinite  leave  to
    remain at some point prior to May 1991.

33. By virtue of the passage of time and the lack of detailed  information,
    it is difficult for  me  to  determine  precisely  on  what  basis  the
    appellant came to this country and was then  himself  recognised  as  a
    refugee. The term "family reunion" is repeated  throughout  the  papers
    before me. It appears as though there was a particular policy in  place
    at the time, but I have not been provided with it  by  the  respondent.
    Nor do I have any other Home Office records. It is plausible that there
    was an application made under a policy in order for  the  appellant  to
    join his brother in this country. It is a fact that the  appellant  was
    at all material times an adult and there is  nothing  in  the  evidence
    states that the appellant was only  granted  refugee  status  "in-line"
    with his brother. In my view, there is nothing inconsistent between the
    appellant's entry to the United Kingdom  being  facilitated  through  a
    family reunion policy on the one hand, and the appellant having been  a
    refugee inn his own right on the other, despite the assertion  to  that
    effect made in [10] of the cessation decision  letter  dated  13  March
    2019.

34. Before reaching my finding  on  this  particular  question,  I  address
    certain other aspects of the  evidence.  Both  the  appellant  and  his
    brother assert that their family's property and land  were  confiscated
    by the Vietnamese regime prior to their departure  from  that  country.
    There has been no challenge to this evidence, and I find it to be  both
    reliable and accurate. Further, the appellant has  been  consistent  in
    asserting that he's been jailed by the authorities  on  two  occasions:
    for 1 � years in 1982; and a month in 1987. Both of  these  terms  were
    for unsuccessful attempts to flee the country illegally. This  evidence
    to has not been challenged by the respondent and again I find it to  be
    reliable  and  accurate.  It  fits  well  with  other  aspects  of  the
    appellant's evidence, together with the well-documented actions of  the
    Vietnamese regime at the material time.

35. The First-tier Tribunal  considered  the  circumstances  in  which  the
    appellant came to United Kingdom in very brief terms  in  [37]  of  its
    decision. Whilst it is said there that the appellant  had  not  had  to
    demonstrate any "personal targeted risk fear", it was also stated  that
    a risk to the appellant on return to Vietnam would have been on grounds
    of "actual or imputed political opinion". That assessment  is  somewhat
    ambiguous.

36. Bringing what I have said in the preceding three paragraphs together, I
    find that it is more likely than not that the appellant was  recognised
    as a refugee not simply "in-line" with the status of his  brother,  but
    because it was accepted that the appellant himself would be at risk  on
    return  on  account  of  his  illegal  departure,  views,  history   of
    detentions, and the nature of the Vietnamese regime at the time.

37. Based on the  evidence  as  a  whole,  including  that  which  was  not
    available to the First-tier Tribunal, I find that the  appellant  holds
    genuine contempt for the  Vietnamese  regime,  given  what  befell  his
    family when the last resided in that country. The holding of this  view
    is not inconsistent with the fact,  as  I  find  it  to  be,  that  the
    appellant has not engaged in any meaningful anti-regime  activities  in
    the United Kingdom.

38. At one point in his oral evidence, the appellant  appeared  to  suggest
    that he might get involved in  an  anti-regime  group  if  returned  to
    Vietnam. I have to say that I do  not  accept  this.  I  am  not  clear
    whether the appellant in fact meant to  say  that  he  would  some  way
    become a political activist, but if this was the intention, it does not
    sit well with the absence of any such activity  whilst  in  the  United
    Kingdom. What there is, however, is an underlying genuinely held hatred
    for the regime. The absence of expression of this in the United Kingdom
    does not in my view detract from the strength with which it is held.  I
    am willing to accept, in light of the evidence as  a  whole,  that  the
    appellant would wish to express his views of the regime if returned  to
    Vietnam, albeit not in the context of belonging to a  particular  group
    or organisation. I also accept that the appellant would regard  himself
    as living as a "prisoner of conscience" in that country, simply because
    he would be residing under  the  authority  of  a  regime  that  he  so
    dislikes.

39. The appellant has told me that he  would  not  speak  out  against  the
    regime because of the consequences of so  doing.  I  accept  that  this
    represents a truthful position.

40. I find that the appellant has visited Vietnam  on  four  occasions:  in
    2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. There is no challenge to his evidence  that
    all the visits related to family matters. I find  that  the  first  two
    visits were to see his elderly parents, the third  was  to  attend  his
    father's funeral, and  the  last  was  the  first  anniversary  of  the
    father's death. I find that each of the visits lasted for 41  days  and
    that there were no problems from the authorities.

41. Turning to the appellant's circumstances in the United Kingdom, I  find
    that his criminal history is as set out in paragraph  5,  above.  There
    have been no further criminal proceedings after the 2011 conviction.  I
    accept the unchallenged evidence that the appellant  no  longer  drinks
    alcohol.

42. I find that the appellant separated from his wife many years  ago.  His
    four adult children reside in the United Kingdom. There is virtually no
    evidence about them before me. Whilst I accept that the appellant has a
    good relationship with his children, I find that there is no particular
    dependency of the former upon the latter.

43. I accept that the appellant is in  a  relationship  with  a  Vietnamese
    national in this country, and has been for some time.  It  is  accepted
    that this individual does not have status in the United Kingdom. I note
    to that she did not attend the hearing before me.

44. I find that the appellant  does  have  a  good  relationship  with  his
    brother, who has supported him to an extent  in  recent  times.  Again,
    however, there is no evidence of any particular dependency and  I  find
    that there is none.

45. I find that the  appellant  suffers  from  hypertension,  although  the
    medical evidence  does  not  indicate  that  this  is  a  significantly
    debilitating condition.  The  evidence  does  not  disclose  any  other
    conditions of note.

46. I find that the appellant has worked in the United Kingdom in a variety
    of jobs including  hospitality,  a  nail  shop,  a  restaurant,  and  a
    supermarket. I accept the appellant's evidence that he is not  educated
    and only ever worked as a fisherman whilst in Vietnam.

Conclusions on the cessation issue

47. The burden of showing that the cessation clause in question applies  to
    the appellant rests with the respondent, and the standard of  proof  is
    that of a balance of probabilities.

48. In addressing this issue, I have  directed  myself  to  the  clutch  of
    recent judgments of the Court of Appeal, including MM (Zimbabwe) [2017]
    EWCA Civ 797, MA (Somalia) [2018] EWCA Civ 994, KN  (DRC)  [2019]  EWCA
    Civ 1665, JS (Uganda) (cited above), and Mosira [2017] EWCA Civ 407.

49. Before setting out my central conclusions, I deal with the Dang  point.
    Although the matter is not entirely clear-cut, both representatives are
    adamant that that decision does  not  determine  the  outcome  of  this
    appeal, despite the fact that the appellant was granted refugee  status
    prior to 2004. In all the circumstances, I agree with this position.  I
    do so because the particular ground upon which cessation/revocation  is
    advanced by the respondent is not that under consideration in Dang, and
    there is no material difference between Article 1C(5) of the Convention
    339A(v) of the Rules. Both provisions are cited in the various decision
    letters issued by the respondent, but  it  is  clear  enough  that  the
    Convention is specifically relied upon: in other words, this is  not  a
    case in which only the Rules are invoked against the appellant.

50. Moving on, I conclude that  in  light  of  my  findings  of  fact,  the
    appellant's case is not one concerning simply a "derivative" basis  for
    recognition of refugee status: the appellant was a  Convention  refugee
    in his own right.

51. The individualised  assessment  of  whether  the  cessation  clause  in
    question applies involves consideration of  "the  circumstances"  which
    led to the  appellant  being  a  Convention  refugee.  As  now  clearly
    established by the case-law, "the circumstances" has  a  broad  meaning
    and include matters related to the general political conditions in  the
    country of origin and relevant aspects  of  the  individual's  personal
    characteristics. There are, then, objective and subjective elements.  I
    disagree with Mr Uddin's  submission  that  the  objective  element  is
    inherently more important than the subjective aspect. Both start from a
    position of equality, although, depending on the facts of a  case,  one
    may ultimately attract greater significance than the other.

52.  Before  addressing  the  country  information  relied  upon   by   the
    respondent, I record that there  is  no  dispute  that  the  Vietnamese
    authorities had a very  poor  human  rights  record  at  the  time  the
    appellant left his country and  subsequently  had  his  refugee  status
    recognised in the United Kingdom.

53. The cessation decision letter cites a Reuters article  published  on  9
    March 2015, and entitled, "40 years after escaping war,  "boat  people"
    find fortune back in Vietnam". The entire text of this article  is  set
    out. In summary, the piece is based upon the stories  of  three  former
    "boat people" who had returned to Vietnam and made a success  of  their
    lives. The article makes reference to "many former refugees  and  their
    offspring"  having  returned  and  benefited  from  Vietnam's  "booming
    emerging market and middle-class growth", although  no  statistics  are
    provided as to the actual numbers. In my view, this item of evidence is
    unpersuasive. Aside from it now being 4  �  years  old,  it  is  purely
    anecdotal and self-evidently very limited in  scope.  It  says  nothing
    about the government's overall attitude towards political  dissent  and
    the consequences for those who seek to express  their  dislike  of  the
    status quo.

54. The second item of country evidence cited in the decision letter is  an
    extract from the United States Department of State Country  Reports  on
    Human Rights Practices 2015. The short passage simply states  that  the
    Vietnamese constitution provides for freedom of internal movement,  and
    that there was cooperation with UNHCR in respect of IDPs  and,  amongst
    others, returning refugees. Again, this limited extract does little  to
    advance the respondent's case to show that there has been a fundamental
    and durable change in the  relevant  circumstances  pertaining  to  the
    Vietnamese government's attitude towards political opposition.

55. Mr Bramble has relied on a passage in the recent  Fact-Finding  Mission
    report in which it  is  said  that  political  activists  returning  to
    Vietnam may  be  interviewed  and/or  detained,  depending  upon  their
    profile. This  evidence  is  not  strictly  speaking  relevant  to  the
    appellant's case because he has not been, even on his own  evidence,  a
    political activist in the United Kingdom.

56. In its letter of 26 February 2018, UNHCR cites the  2016  Human  Rights
    Watch report: "... Vietnam's  record  on  civil  and  political  rights
    remained dismal." UNHCR's position in this case is that there  has  not
    been the requisite fundamental  change  in  the  country  situation.  I
    regard this view as worthy of considerable weight.

57. The Country Policy and Information Note contains the following  in  the
    "Analysis" section:

           "2.4.5 The government does not permit independent,  local  human
           rights  organisations  to  form  or  operate.  Furthermore,  the
           government  does  not  tolerate  attempts  by  organisations  or
           individuals to criticize its  human  rights  practices  publicly
           (see Treatment by the state and Human rights groups).

           2.4.6 Those who  openly  criticise  the  state  or  who  protest
           against the government are likely to attract  adverse  attention
           from  the  authorities.  Treatment  will  vary  depending  on  a
           person's level of involvement, the nature of the activities, the
           persons role in those activities  and  their  profile.  Where  a
           person is perceived to be  a  low  level  protester/  opposition
           supporter they may be subject to intimidation by police and  may
           be  arrested  and  subsequently  released  but   this   is   not
           sufficiently serious by its nature and repetition as  to  amount
           to persecution or serious harm."

58. Later in the document extracts from the 2017 United  States  Department
    of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices is cited:  "The  law
    prohibits physical abuse of detainees, but suspects  commonly  reported
    mistreatment and torture by police..." (6.3.4)

59. Under the sub-heading of "Civil  society",  the  report  of  the  Fact-
    Finding  Mission  contains  evidence  indicating   that   whilst   some
    academics/intellectuals may have limited scope to challenge  government
    policies, activists do not.

60. Taken as a whole, the  country  information  does  not  show  that  the
    circumstances relating to the Vietnamese government's attitude  towards
    political dissent has  fundamentally  and  durably  changed  since  the
    appellant left that country some thirty years ago. The  respondent  has
    therefore failed to discharge the burden in respect  of  the  objective
    element of the individualised assessment.

61. Turning to the subjective element, it  is  clear,  as  I  have  already
    stated, that the appellant has never been a political activist  in  the
    United Kingdom. It is also clear that he was not a  political  activist
    prior to his departure from Vietnam. In this  sense,  there  has  never
    been a risk  to  the  appellant  on  the  basis  of  proactive,  public
    behaviour. The ability of the appellant to  have  undertaken  the  four
    visits without being detained at any time  is  powerful  evidence  that
    there is no existing adverse interest in him. In fairness to Mr  Uddin,
    he has not sought to suggest the presence of any such risk profile.

62. Yet that is not the whole picture. The appellant has, on  my  findings,
    consistently held avowedly anti-regime beliefs from  when  he  and  his
    family had their property confiscated to the present day.  Nothing  has
    changed in this respect.  It  was  these  beliefs,  together  with  the
    consequent actions of fleeing  Vietnam,  which  made  the  appellant  a
    Convention refugee  upon  his  departure.  The  question  is,  has  the
    respondent  shown  that  the  subjective  element  of  the  appellant's
    circumstances no longer give rise to a well-founded  fear  in  Vietnam,
    given what I have said about the objective situation and the absence of
    any change in the anti-regime beliefs?

63. The answer to this question is "no". I have found that if  returned  to
    Vietnam, the appellant would hold a genuine wish to speak  out  against
    the government as a result of his personal history. This would  not  be
    in the context of organised, political activism, but  as  an  aggrieved
    individual. I have also accepted that the appellant would  not  express
    anti-regime views for the reason that  the  consequences  of  so  doing
    would be adverse  to  him.  The  country  information  provides  strong
    objective support for his reticence. Whilst there would  be  a  greater
    risk to members of opposition groups, the information before  me,  when
    seen in light of the facts of this case, is sufficient to show  a  real
    risk of ill-treatment to an individual intent on speaking  out  against
    the regime. The circumstances of this case therefore engage  the  well-
    known principles set out in HJ (Iran) [2010] 3 WLR 386: the  individual
    holds genuine beliefs that they would wish to express, but will not  do
    so in order to avoid the risk of persecutory treatment.

64.  When  the  objective  and   subjective   elements   of   the   overall
    individualised assessment are brought together,  I  conclude  that  the
    respondent has failed to show that the circumstances in connection with
    which the appellant had been recognised as a  refugee  have  ceased  to
    exist. I emphasise that my assessment is, by its nature,  highly  fact-
    specific.

65. It follows that the appellant succeeds  in  respect  of  the  cessation
    issue and the ground of appeal under section 84(3)(a) of the  2002  Act
    is made out.

Conclusions on the Article 8 issue

66. The appellant undoubtedly has established a private life in the  United
    Kingdom over the course of his lengthy residence in this country.

67. I accept that the appellant has also established family life  with  his
    current partner. In all the circumstances, I do not accept  that  there
    is family life  as  between  the  appellant,  his  adult  children  and
    brother. Although they have good relationships, there has been  nothing
    to show any relevant dependency or ties going beyond the norm.

68. The respondent's decision clearly constitutes an interference with  the
    appellant's private life. The same is not true of the family life.  The
    appellant's partner has no status in this country and no  argument  has
    been put forward as to why she would not simply follow the Appellant to
    Vietnam,  thereby   avoiding   any   interference   in   the   couple's
    relationship.

69. It is common ground that the respondent's decision to refuse the  human
    rights claim is in accordance with the law and was made pursuant to the
    legitimate aim of preventing disorder or crime.

70. In reaching the proportionality stage, there is a  wealth  of  relevant
    case-law, in addition to the legislative and other provisions  referred
    to earlier in my decision. I do not propose to cite cases here,  but  I
    direct myself with reference to the following general propositions:

              a) cases are inherently fact-specific;

              b) the appellant's case must be assessed through the prism  of
                 the relevant Rules and with regard to the mandatory factors
                 set out in section 117C of the 2002 Act;

              c) as an overarching factor, there is  a  very  strong  public
                 interest in deporting foreign criminals;

              d) this public interest  is  essentially  comprised  of  three
                 facets: the risk of  reoffending;  deterrence;  and  public
                 confidence in removing offenders;

              e) the individual's entire offending history is relevant;

              f) a failure to satisfy the relevant Rules is relevant to, but
                 not determinative of, the success of an appeal;

              g) ultimately, the question for a tribunal is whether  a  fair
                 balance has been struck between the competing interests  of
                 the individual and the public.

71. Certain matters are not in dispute and can be dealt with very  briefly.
    By virtue of section 117D(2)(c )(i) of the 2002 Act and  para  398b  of
    the Rules, the appellant is a "foreign criminal" by virtue  of  the  15
    months' sentence imposed in February 2006. The  appellant  cannot  meet
    the exceptions set out in section 117C(4) and (5) of the 2002  Act  and
    paras 399a - 399A of  the  Rules:  there  is  no  relevant  partner  or
    children involved in this case, and, leaving aside issues of social and
    cultural integration and very significant obstacles, the appellant  has
    not spent most of his life in United Kingdom.

72. In light of the above, and with reference to  section  117C(6)  of  the
    2002 Act, the Appellant must show "very compelling  circumstances  over
    and above" those described in the two exceptions. Factors pertaining to
    the  exceptions  may  also  be  relevant   to   the   very   compelling
    circumstances test. That test is self-evidently very stringent indeed.

73. I turn to the balancing  exercise.

74. First and foremost, I reiterate that the  public  interest  is  a  very
    powerful overarching composite factor.

75. In considering the appellant's overall offending history, I deal  first
    with the "index" offence for which he was convicted on 15  August  2005
    and sentenced on 13 February the following year (that  being  the  sole
    basis  upon  which  deportation  proceedings  were  instigated  by  the
    respondent). I have no sentencing remarks or a pre-sentence report. The
    certificate of conviction confirms that the appellant entered a  guilty
    plea. I am assuming that  the  offence  related  to  what  is  commonly
    referred to as a "cannabis farm". I have not been provided with details
    as to the specifics of the appellant's involvement in  the  conspiracy.
    Although  I  have  not  been  provided  with  the  relevant  sentencing
    guidelines, the sentence of 15 months' imprisonment must be  reflective
    in part of the guilty plea and either a lower level of participation by
    the appellant, the relatively small scale of the conspiracy,  or  other
    matters of which  I  cannot  speculate  upon.  Having  said  that,  the
    production of any illegal drugs  is  clearly  contrary  to  the  public
    interest.

76. The appellant has three convictions for  driving  motor  vehicles  with
    excess alcohol. These offences  are  clearly  contrary  to  the  public
    interest. Whilst there is no evidence to show that serious harm was  in
    fact caused by the offences,  the  risk  of  such  harm  is  inevitably
    present when an individual drives a  vehicle  with  excess  alcohol  in
    their system. The fact that the appellant committed three such offences
    is clearly relevant and adds  to  the  weight  of  the  overall  public
    interest.

77. There is a clear public interest in deterring  foreign  nationals  from
    committing offences whilst in the United Kingdom.

78. It is also in the public interest that society has  confidence  in  the
    ability of the authorities to deal  with  foreign  nationals  who  have
    committed offences in this country by taking deportation action.

79. The third specific facet of the public interest is that of the risk  of
    reoffending. There are no formal assessments in evidence before me.  On
    what I do have, and in light of my findings thereon, it is  clear  that
    the appellant represents a very low risk of reoffending as regards  any
    drugs-related activity. I take into account the fact  that  he  pleaded
    guilty to the single offence back in 2005, and that there have been  no
    similar offences since. The risk of the  appellant  driving  a  vehicle
    with  excess  alcohol  is  likely  to  be  higher,  but  in   all   the
    circumstances I nonetheless regard it  as  being  low.  The  last  such
    offence occurred in 2011 and I have  accepted  that  the  appellant  no
    longer drinks alcohol.

80. The appellant is unable to bring  himself  within  either  of  the  two
    exceptions under the 2002 Act and the Rules. The reasons why he  cannot
    satisfy the family life-related exception are clear-cut. In respect  of
    the private life exception, it is a fact that he has not spent most  of
    his life in the United Kingdom. The other two limbs  of  the  exception
    require further consideration.

81. The Appellant does not appear to speak particularly good English and it
    seems as though his life in  this  country  has  been  largely  focused
    within the Vietnamese community. However, he has been in United Kingdom
    for a very significant period of time. He  has  been  involved  in  the
    upbringing of his four children here, with what  I  consider  to  be  a
    likely consequence that he did engage with wider society around him.  I
    note too that not all of his employment relates to jobs which would, on
    the face of it, only have led to  him  interact  with  members  of  the
    Vietnamese community in this country. Finally,  I  do  not  regard  the
    offending history as a reason to conclude that there has been no social
    and/or cultural integration. On the facts of this case,  the  offending
    has not been persistent, when its place within the appellant's  lengthy
    residence in this country is taken into account.  Overall,  I  conclude
    that the appellant is sufficiently socially and  culturally  integrated
    in the United Kingdom.

82. With the high threshold in mind and carrying  out  a  broad  evaluative
    assessment, I conclude, by a narrow margin, that  the  appellant  would
    face  very  significant  obstacles  to  reintegration  into  Vietnamese
    society. It is of course the case that the appellant spent the majority
    of his life in Vietnam,  speaks  the  language,  has  visited  on  four
    occasions since his departure thirty years ago, and will have at  least
    some familiarity with cultural norms in that country. In addition,  the
    appellant does not suffer from significant health issues and would,  in
    theory, be able to work. On the other side  of  the  equation,  I  have
    taken account of the following factors. The time  spent  away  is  very
    significant. The appellant has no assets or other  meaningful  ties  to
    Vietnam. Indeed, he holds a strong dislike of the regime and whether or
    not this would lead to any risks, in my view he would regard himself as
    an outsider. The four visits will have given  him  some  experience  of
    life in the country since his departure, but this  cannot  be  said  to
    represent an accurate reflection of permanent life there. the Appellant
    is uneducated and his only previous work in his home country was  as  a
    fisherman.

83. Although I have concluded this issue in  the  appellant's  favour,  the
    fact that it is a close call means that it cannot play a material  part
    in the "very compelling circumstances" assessment.

84. There are two factors arising from section 117B of the  2002  Act.  The
    appellant's  limited  level  of  English  counts  against  him  in  the
    balancing exercise. His  indefinite  leave  to  remain  throughout  his
    residence in the United Kingdom has not been "precarious" (see para  44
    of Rhuppiah [2018] 1 WLR 5536).

85. This brings me finally to the issue of delay. It is  worth  reiterating
    the periods in question. No deportation action was instigated following
    the appellant's first two convictions for driving with excess  alcohol:
    the sole basis for such action was the 2005 conviction (although it  is
    the 2006 sentencing which is  referred  to  in  the  relevant  decision
    letters). That action was only begun in October 2016 when  the  legally
    flawed stage 1  decision  to  deport  letter  was  issued.  That  delay
    amounted to over 11 years from the date of conviction. It then took the
    respondent a further 18 months to issue what transpired to  be  another
    flawed decision letter on 22 April 2018. The  final  decision  (legally
    sound) letter was not issued until 30 January 2019, just under 13 years
    from the sentencing for the index offence and  some  months  over  that
    figure in respect of the conviction. Even were one to regard  the  2011
    conviction for the driving  offence  as  a  relevant  trigger  for  the
    deportation action (a  position  that  would,  to  say  the  least,  be
    extremely generous to the respondent, given the fact  that  the  action
    was based solely upon the drugs offence), there was  still  an  initial
    delay of 5 years before the flawed decision of October 2016 was issued,
    followed by a further period of 2  �  years  until  the  letter  of  30
    January 2019 was produced, making a total of 7 � years.

86. At the hearing I informed the representatives that I was aware  of  two
    judgments of the Court of Appeal relating to delay in  the  deportation
    context. The first is MN-T (Colombia)  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  893,  a  case
    involving a delay of 5 years  between  the  individual's  release  from
    prison (following an 8-year sentence)  and  the  start  of  deportation
    action by the respondent. At [35] the Court held,

           "I agree that rehabilitation alone would not suffice to  justify
           the Upper Tribunal's decision in this case. If it had  not  been
           for the long delay by the Secretary of State in taking action to
           deport, in my view there would be no  question  of  saying  that
           "very compelling circumstances over and above those described in
           Exceptions 1 and 2"  outweighed  the  high  public  interest  in
           deportation. But that lengthy delay makes a critical difference.
           That lengthy delay is an exceptional circumstance. It has led to
           the claimant substantially strengthening her family and  private
           life here. Also, it has led to her  rehabilitation  and  to  her
           demonstrating the fact of her rehabilitation by her  industrious
           life over the last 13 years. This is one of those cases which is
           on the borderline."

87. At [40] to [42] of MN-T, the Court rejected the respondent's submission
    that the issue of delay, in the context of a deportation decision,  was
    incapable of reducing the public interest. It was also  held  that,  if
    during a lengthy period the criminal becomes  rehabilitated  and  shows
    himself or herself to have become a law-abiding citizen,  he/she  poses
    less of a risk or threat to the public, that the  deterrent  effect  of
    the policy is weakened if the respondent does  not  act  promptly,  and
    that public confidence  in the  need  to  take  appropriate  action  is
    undermined if nothing is done for many years.

88. The observations in MN-T was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal
    in Saif Ullah [2017] EWCA Civ 1069, at [61].

89. The second judgment of the Court of Appeal is RJG [2016] EWCA Civ 1042.
    At [54] the Court stated:

           "I would accept that, in principle, a substantial delay  on  the
           part of the Secretary of State in pursuing the deportation of  a
           person convicted of serious crime could be an  important  factor
           in determining the  proportionality  of  the  deportation,  both
           because it might reflect on the weight to be given to the public
           interest in  deportation  and  because  of  its  effect  on  the
           individuals concerned. In the latter regard, I  have  firmly  in
           mind the observations of  Lord  Bingham  of  Cornhill,  made  in
           another context, in EB (Kosovo) v Secretary  of  State  for  the
           Home Department [2009] 1AC 1159 at [14]-[16]."

90. Whilst on the facts of that case, the appellant did  not  succeed,  the
    potential significance of delay in the deportation context  is  clearly
    established.

91.  The  delays  set  out  in  paragraph  85  above  are  inordinate   and
    extraordinary.  There  has  never  been  any   explanation   from   the
    respondent,  let  alone  one  capable  of  carrying  any   weight.   In
    particular, it has not  been  suggested  that  it  was  only  the  2011
    conviction which prompted deportation action.

92. I acknowledge that the appellant did not lead a  blameless  life  after
    the 2005 conviction, and in some respects he did not develop additional
    ties in the United Kingdom during the delay (for  example,  starting  a
    family, marrying a British citizen, or suchlike).  However,  there  was
    only one incident of misconduct during the 11 years since  any  actions
    whatsoever was instigated and the 13 years between the 2005  conviction
    and the belated, lawful deportation decision.  I  have  found  that  he
    represents at most a low risk to the public in respect of  reoffending.
    The appellant had continued to live  his  life  in  this  country  with
    settled status as a refugee and without there being any indication that
    the authorities were intent on revoking his leave and seeking to remove
    him under the deportation route.

93. Whilst I do not go so far as to find that the delay "entirely"  diluted
    the public interest in this  case,  it  does  have  the  effect  of  so
    significantly  undermining  the   deterrence   factor,   the   public's
    confidence in action being taken  against  foreign  criminal,  and  the
    overall public interest, that it constitutes, on  a  truly  exceptional
    basis, a "very compelling circumstance" over and above those  described
    in the two exceptions. Put another way, the delay carries  such  weight
    in the appellant's side of the scales as to  tip  the  balance  in  his
    favour,  notwithstanding  the  very  stringent  nature  of  the   "very
    compelling circumstances" test and the powerful factors ranged  against
    him. It is, to borrow a term used in MN-T, a "critical" feature of this
    case.

94. The appellant therefore succeeds  on  the  Article  8  issue  and  with
    reference to the ground of appeal under section 84(1)(c ) of  the  2002
    Act.

95. I continue the order I made in respect of the error of law decision.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside.

I re-make the decision by allowing  the  appeal  on  the  grounds  that  the
respondent's decision to revoke the appellant's protection  status  breaches
the United Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee Convention, and that  the
decision to refuse the appellant's human  rights  claim  is  unlawful  under
section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. For  ease  of  reference,  I  shall  refer  to  the  Appellant  in  the
    proceedings before the Upper Tribunal as the Secretary of State and  to
    the Respondent as the Claimant.

 2. This is a challenge by the Secretary of State against the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Fowell ("the judge"), promulgated on  28  May
    2019,  in  which  he  allowed  the  Claimant's   appeal   against   the
    respondent's decisions, both dated 13 March  2019,  with  revoking  the
    Claimant's refugee status and refusing his human rights claim.

 3. The Claimant, a national of Vietnam, arrived in the United  Kingdom  in
    June 1991, having already  been  recognised  as  a  refugee  two  years
    previously whilst residing in a camp in Malaysia.  The  basis  of  this
    recognition appears to  have  been  that  the  Claimant's  brother  was
    already in this country and so the policy (as it then  was)  of  family
    reunion applied. The Claimant was granted indefinite leave to remain in
    January 1992 and later that year was joined in this country by his wife
    and children, who themselves came under the family reunion policy.

 4. Whilst in this country, the Claimant accrued a number  of  convictions.
    Three of these (in 1997, 2001, and 2011) were for driving  with  excess
    alcohol. However, the relevant conviction for  the  purposes  of  these
    proceedings was that obtained in August 2005, for conspiracy to  supply
    Class B drugs, namely cannabis. In February 2006 he was sentenced to 15
    months' imprisonment.

 5. No action of any sort was taken by the Secretary of State until October
    2016, when a "Notification of Intention to Cease Refugee Status" letter
    was  sent  out  to  the  Claimant.  Representations   from   his   then
    representatives were submitted  and  there  was  a  further  period  of
    apparent inactivity by the Secretary of State until April 2018, when  a
    decision was made to make  a  Deportation  Order  pursuant  to  the  UK
    Borders Act 2007. This was subsequently recognised as being  erroneous,
    as that Act had not been  in  force  at  the  time  of  the  Claimant's
    sentencing in 2006. The decision was withdrawn.  A  new  (unappealable)
    deportation decision was made on 30 January 2019, based  this  time  on
    section 3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act  1971.  As  already  noted,  the
    cessation/revocation decision and refusal of  the  human  rights  claim
    followed in March 2019.

 6. The specific basis relied upon by the Secretary of State  for  revoking
    the refugee status was Article 1A(C  )(5)  of  the  Refugee  Convention
    ("the Convention") and para 339A(v)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  ("the
    Rules"). It was said that the circumstances of the basis upon which the
    Claimant was originally recognised as a refugee had ceased to exist.

 7. The Secretary of State did not issue a certificate under section 72  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002,  as  amended  ("NIAA
    2002").

The judge's decision

 8. Having set out the legal framework, the evidence, and  the  submissions
    made by the representatives,  the  judge  goes  on  to  deal  with  the
    cessation issue. He concludes that the Secretary of State had failed to
    show that there had been a sufficiently significant and durable  change
    in the nature of the Vietnamese government. He also concluded that  the
    Secretary of State had not undertaken any "verification" in respect  of
    ensuring that the Claimant would not now be persecuted on return.

 9. In respect of the Article 8 claim, the judge notes  that  the  Claimant
    could not satisfy the exception (contained in paragraph 399a  or  b  of
    the Rules and section 117C(5) NIAA 2002) in respect of his  partner  or
    his children (all four of whom were adults).

10. The Claimant's private life is then assessed. The judge concludes  that
    he had become socially and culturally integrated in the United Kingdom,
    and  that  his  removal  to  Vietnam  would  involve  very  significant
    obstacles to reintegration in that country. However,  as  a  matter  of
    fact, the Claimant had not resided in this country  lawfully  for  more
    than half of his life. Therefore, the  "very  compelling  circumstances
    over and above"  test  applied.  The  judge  took  the  view  that  the
    satisfaction of two out of three of the criteria under para 399A of the
    Rules not sufficient for  the  Claimant  to  succeed.  He  goes  on  to
    consider the issue of delay in this case and concludes that its  length
    and nature was such that, when combined with the para 399A factors, the
    Claimant was able to meet the very high threshold. The circumstances of
    the Claimant's relationship with  his  partner  was  considered  to  be
    relevant, but the judge did not appear to rely on this for his  overall
    conclusion.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

11. The Secretary of State's  grounds  of  appeal  rely  on  the  Court  of
    Appeal's judgment  in  MA  (Somalia)  [2018]  EWCA  Civ  994,  and  its
    interpretation of the CJEU's judgment in Abdulla [2010] 3 WLR 1624.  It
    is asserted that the judge failed to treat the  cessation  issue  as  a
    "mirror image" of a decision determining refugee  status.  It  is  said
    that the judge failed to give proper consideration to the fact that the
    Claimant had returned to Vietnam on a number  of  occasions  since  his
    arrival in the United Kingdom.

12. The grounds assert that the judge failed to give  adequate  reasons  in
    respect of the Article 8 conclusions, and failed to consider the public
    interest factors of deterrence and "revulsion".

13. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Osborne
    on  19  June  2019.  Rather  unfortunately,  Judge  Osborne  does   not
    specifically address the cessation issue in his grant, although  it  is
    clear that permission was being given on all grounds put forward.

Decision on error of law

The cessation issue

14. For the purposes of my decision I am going to proceed on the basis that
    the cessation issue was not academic because of the potential effect of
    Dang (Refugee - query revocation - Article 3) [2013] UKUT 43 (IAC) (but
    see my observations under "Disposal", below).

15. I have considered the judge's treatment of this issue in the context of
    the way in which the Secretary of State's case was put to  him,  namely
    that the sole  basis  for  the  cessation/revocation  action  was  that
    elucidated under Article 1C(5) of the Convention and  para  339A(v)  of
    the Rules.

16. For the reasons set out below, I conclude that the judge has materially
    erred in law.

17. The judge was of course correct to have directed  himself  to  Abdulla.
    However, the subsequent domestic authorities of MM [2017] EWCA Civ  797
    and MA (Somalia) [2018] EWCA Civ 994, were both germane  to  the  issue
    under consideration. MA (Somalia) in particular is of significance,  as
    it represents binding guidance on the interpretation and application of
    Abdulla and the Qualification Directive 2004/83/EC, and cites  MM  with
    approval.

18. The overall view of the CJEU in Abdulla is stated in  para  76  of  the
    judgment:

           "76 In view of all the foregoing considerations, the  answer  to
           the first question is that article 11(1)(e) of the Directive  is
           to be interpreted as meaning that (i) refugee status  ceases  to
           exist when, having regard to a  change  of  circumstances  of  a
           significant  and  non-temporary  nature  in  the  third  country
           concerned, the circumstances which justified the  person's  fear
           of persecution for one of the reasons  referred  to  in  article
           2(c) of the Directive, on the basis of which refugee status  was
           granted, no longer exist and that person has no other reason  to
           fear being "persecuted" within the meaning of  article  2(c)  of
           the Directive; (ii) for the purposes of assessing  a  change  of
           circumstances, the competent authorities  of  the  member  state
           must  verify,  having  regard  to   the   refugee's   individual
           situation, that the actor or actors of protection referred to in
           article 7(1) of the Directive have  taken  reasonable  steps  to
           prevent the persecution,  that  they  therefore  operate,  inter
           alia, an effective legal system for the  detection,  prosecution
           and punishment of acts constituting persecution,  and  that  the
           national concerned will have access to  such  protection  if  he
           ceases to have refugee status; (iii) the  actors  of  protection
           referred to in article 7(1)(b) of  the  Directive  may  comprise
           international  organisations  controlling   the   state   or   a
           substantial part of the territory of  the  state,  including  by
           means  of  the  presence  of  a  multinational  force  in   that
           territory."

19. Three passages from MA (Somalia) are of most relevance here:

           "2. For the reasons given below, and in the light of the careful
           submissions that we have had on the important  decision  of  the
           Court of Justice of the European Union ("CJEU") in Joined  Cases
           C-175/08, C-176/08, C-178/08, C0179/08, Aydin Salahadin Abdulla,
           Kamil Hasan, Ahmed Adem,  Hamrin  Mosa  Rashi  &  Dier  Jamal  v
           Bundesrepublik Deutschland, 2 March  2010  ("Abdulla"),  I  have
           concluded that:

                 (1) A cessation decision is the mirror image of a  decision
                 determining refugee status. By that I mean that the grounds
                 for cessation  do  not  go  beyond  verifying  whether  the
                 grounds for  recognition  of  refugee  status  continue  to
                 exist. Thus, the relevant question  is  whether  there  has
                 been   a   significant   and   non-temporary   change    in
                 circumstances so that the circumstances  which  caused  the
                 person to be a refugee have ceased to apply and there is no
                 other basis on which he would be held to be a refugee.  The
                 recognising state does not in addition have to be satisfied
                 that the country of origin has a system of government or an
                 effective legal system for protecting basic  human  rights,
                 though the absence of such systems may of  course  lead  to
                 the conclusion that a significant and non-temporary  change
                 in circumstances has not occurred.

           "49. Another way of  putting  the  point  is  that  the  Refugee
           Convention and the QD are not measures  for  ensuring  political
           and judicial reform in the countries of origin of refugees.  The
           risks which entitle individuals to protection  are  risks  which
           affect them personally and individually. It is an individualised
           approach. Just as it is no answer to an asylum claim that  there
           is a legal system which might in theory be able to protect them,
           so conversely the absence of such a system is not an answer to a
           cessation  decision  if  it  is  shown  that  the  refugee   has
           sufficient, lasting protection in other ways or  that  the  fear
           which gave rise to the need for protection has in any event been
           superseded and disappeared.

           ...

           53. Mr Waite's overarching point is that the wording of  the  QD
           supports the contention that the applicable test is whether  the
           circumstances which formed the  basis  for  granting  protection
           still exist and require protection to be given. In my  judgment,
           this was the argument accepted by the CJEU. Paragraph 65 of  the
           decision confirms that refugee status can be  ceased.  Paragraph
           66 makes it clear that the reason  for  ceasing  refugee  status
           must be that because of a change in  circumstances  the  refugee
           can no longer refuse to accept the protection of the country  of
           origin. Paragraph 67 to 69 make it clear that the protection  is
           "the same" as that previously lacking. Paragraphs 70 and 71 deal
           with the steps which the recognising state must  take  to  check
           that there is the relevant protection, but it  is  to  be  noted
           that these checks are rooted in the QD and go  no  further  than
           the QD itself provides. Thus,  paragraph  70  states  that  when
           fulfilling their obligations under Article  7(2)  the  competent
           authorities of  the  recognising  state  must  verify  that  the
           institutions of the state of origin "have taken reasonable steps
           to prevent  persecution  and  that  they  therefore  operate  an
           effective legal system for investigating and punishing  acts  of
           persecution and that the individual will  have  access  to  that
           protection if he  ceases  to  have  refugee  status".  Likewise,
           paragraph 71 makes it clear the protection is to  be  considered
           on an individualised basis: the recognising state does not  have
           to  consider  whether  the  institutions  achieve  a  particular
           standard for all purposes."

20. Para 24 of MM states:

           "24. However, Article 1C(5) is framed more widely than this, and
           requires examination of whether there has been a relevant change
           in "the circumstances in connexion with  which  [a  person]  has
           been recognised as a refugee". The circumstances  in  connection
           with which a person has been recognised as a refugee are  likely
           to be a combination of the general political conditions in  that
           person's home country and some aspect of that person's  personal
           characteristics. Accordingly, a relevant change in circumstances
           for the purposes of Article 1C(5) might  in  a  particular  case
           also  arise  from  a  combination  of  changes  in  the  general
           political conditions in the home country and in the individual's
           personal characteristics, or even from  a  change  just  in  the
           individual's personal characteristics, if that change means that
           he now falls outside a group likely  to  be  persecuted  by  the
           authorities of the home state. The relevant change must in  each
           case be durable in nature."

21. In light of these authorities, I am satisfied that the judge failed  to
    adequately assess the cessation issue on an  individualised  basis  and
    from the premise that it represented a mirror image of a  determination
    of refugee status. The judge's consideration of the issue is set out in
    paras 38 and 39 of his decision:

           "38. It is not simply a question of assessing whether  it  would
           be safe or relatively safe for [the Claimant] to return. As  set
           out above at  paragraph  15,  the  test  in  Abdulla  v  Germany
           involves a number of stages. Taking them in turn, there seems to
           have been a change in circumstances in Vietnam since people  are
           returning and [the Claimant] himself felt that it was safe to do
           so on four occasions; or at least, he was prepared  to  run  the
           risk. But it does not necessarily follow that the  circumstances
           which justified his fear, i.e. the attitude of  the  government,
           no longer exist. I was not given a great  deal  of  information,
           but I note the Human Rights Watch report  quoted  by  the  UNHCR
           stated that the fundamental character of the government has  not
           changed. That is also reflected  in  the  Amnesty  International
           report for 2017/2018 which reported that:

                 "the crackdown on freedom of expression  and  criticism  of
                 government actions and policies intensified, causing scores
                 of peaceful activists to free the country."

           39. That aspect (sic) is not therefore appear to me to have been
    met."

22. These passages indicate that rather than assessing the issue  in  light
    of both the objective situation relating to the Vietnamese  authorities
    and  the  Claimant's  particular  circumstances  (in  other  words,  an
    individualised approach), the judge based his conclusion solely on what
    appears to be somewhat sparse evidence pertaining to the first  of  the
    two aspects. The particular  facts  of  the  case,  together  with  the
    country information cited, reinforce the point. The country information
    referred to a crackdown on criticism of the government, leading  to  an
    exodus of activists from Vietnam. However, on the face of the  evidence
    before the judge, the Claimant was only  recognised  as  a  refugee  by
    virtue of his brother's recognition, had not been a political  activist
    whilst in Vietnam, had never undertaken  any  political  activities  or
    expressed any political views whilst in the United Kingdom, and, as far
    as I can see, has  never  expressed  any  intention  of  voicing  anti-
    government views if returned to his home country. Thus,  when  carrying
    out the exercise of assessing whether, in the words of Article 1C(5) of
    the Convention, "the circumstances in connexion to which [the Claimant]
    has been recognised as  a  refugee  have  ceased  to  exist",  a  close
    analysis of the objective and subjective aspects was  required.  In  my
    view, paras 38 and 39 do not reflect such an undertaking.

23. In saying this, I have of  course  had  full  regard  to  Mr  Bedford's
    submissions, in particular that  the  judge  did  have  regard  to  the
    Claimant's  specific  circumstances,  including  the  four  visits   to
    Vietnam. It is right that these visits are stated in para 38.  However,
    the judge's  error  lies  in  separating  them  (and  other  subjective
    elements) from the objective  country  situation,  thereby  failing  to
    undertake the assessment on an  overall,  individualised  approach,  as
    required by Abdulla and its interpretation in MA (Somalia).

24. The second basis upon which the judge concluded that the  Secretary  of
    State had failed to make out her case relates to verification.  In  his
    view, positive steps by the  Secretary  of  State  were  required,  the
    example given being "communication with the [Vietnamese] government".

25. With respect, the judge has in my view misapprehended what Abdulla  (as
    interpreted by MA (Somalia)) says  on  the  question  of  verification.
    Direct communication by the recognising state (in this case, the United
    Kingdom)  with  the  third  country  government  about   a   particular
    individual's case is not expressly considered in the authorities.  Such
    a possibility  is,  in  any  event,  fraught  with  potential  problems
    relating to confidentiality and suchlike.

26. What Abdulla does say is that "verification" steps to be undertaken  by
    the recognising state may  involve,  for  example,  providing  relevant
    country information on, "the conditions of operation  of,  on  the  one
    hand, the institutions, authorities and security  forces  and,  on  the
    other, all groups or bodies of the third  country  which  may,  by  the
    action or inaction, be responsible for acts of persecution against  the
    recipient of refugee status if he returned to that country." (see  para
    71 of Abdullah). I conclude that the judge  has  erred  by  failing  to
    address the verification issue on a correct footing.

27. There are two errors relating to the cessation/revocation  issue.  They
    are material. To this extent, the judge's decision must be set aside.

The Article 8 issue

28. It is clear enough from  the  judge's  decision  that  he  allowed  the
    Claimant's appeal on Article 8 grounds on the decisive basis  that  the
    Secretary of State had acted with such tardiness  when  initiating  the
    deportation proceedings (and everything that  flowed  from  this)  that
    there were very compelling circumstances over and above those described
    in the exceptions under the Rules and section 117C NIAA 2002.

29. The delay was, on  any  view,  inordinate,  and  the  judge  was  fully
    entitled to take this into account. Contrary to what is said in para  4
    of the grounds of appeal, the Secretary of State has not been  able  to
    identify any binding authority for the proposition that,  "it  is  well
    established that delay or time elapsed carries little  weight  and  the
    public interest in removing a foreign criminal  hasn't  been  diluted."
    Having said that, it is not entirely clear that the judge has evaluated
    the delay issue in the deportation  context,  rather  than  simply  the
    immigration context. The legitimate aim pursued  by  the  Secretary  of
    State in the former scenario is not simply the maintenance of effective
    immigration  control,  but  public  safety.  I   would   not,   though,
    necessarily find a material error of law on this issue alone.

30. I would also accept Mr Bedford's submission that the  judge's  reliance
    on the Claimant's partner was in reality simply an "add-on" and did not
    represent a material factor in the overall conclusion.

31. There is, though, a material error in respect of the judge's failure to
    have specific regard to deterrence and what is now described as  public
    confidence in the ability of the Secretary of State to  deport  foreign
    criminals. These two elements of the public interest  have  been  well-
    established in case-law over the course of time, and they remain valid.
    On the facts of this case, it cannot be said that the judge's  decision
    would have been the same even if these two  issues  had  been  properly
    considered.

32. Therefore, the judge's decision falls to be set aside on this basis  as
    well.

Disposal

33. This appeal shall be retained in the Upper Tribunal.

34. Ordinarily, I would go  on  to  remake  the  decision  based  upon  the
    evidence currently before me. There has  been  no  application  by  the
    Claimant under rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 for further evidence to be adduced. My initial view was that
    there should be no further hearing.

35. However, reluctantly,  I  am  persuaded  that  this  appeal  should  be
    adjourned, and a resumed hearing held prior to the final resolution  of
    this appeal. Notwithstanding the dearth of  evidence  relating  to  the
    Claimant's political views (if any), it would probably  be  prudent  to
    properly canvas this issue.

36. There is a further issue which in my view requires consideration at the
    resumed hearing, albeit that neither the representatives nor the  judge
    has addressed it. The Claimant was recognised as a refugee as far  back
    as 1989 and was granted indefinite leave to remain as a refugee in this
    country in 1992. This of course was many years before the Qualification
    Directive came into force on 21 October 2004. The Secretary of  State's
    cessation/revocation decision is based on para 339A(v)  of  the  Rules,
    which in turn implement the relevant provisions of the Directive. Given
    this uncontroversial set of circumstances, there is a  question  as  to
    the potential impact  of  Dang.  The  relevant  part  of  the  judicial
    headnote reads as follows:

        "A decision to revoke or refuse to renew a  grant  of  asylum  under
        paragraph  339A  of  the  Immigration  Rules  only  relates  to  the
        individual's status  under  the  Qualification  Directive  (European
        refugee status) and not his status  under  the  Refugee  Convention;
        further, it can only apply to cases in which the asylum  application
        was made on or after 21  October  2004  and  at  least  one  of  the
        provisions  in  sub-paragraphs  (i)-(vi)  of  para   339A   of   the
        Immigration Rules applies."

37. I note that no alternative basis of risk on return has  ever  been  put
    forward by the Claimant, and there is no live issue  in  this  respect,
    whether under the Convention or Article 3.

38. As to Article 8, this falls to  be  decided  solely  on  the  basis  of
    whether the Claimant can show "very compelling circumstances  over  and
    above" those described in the exceptions under the  Rules  and  section
    117C NIAA 2002.

Anonymity

39. The First-tier Tribunal made an anonymity order. I continue that  order
    pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008.



Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

I adjourn this appeal for a resumed hearing in due course.


Directions to the parties

   1. No later than 4pm on 30 September 2019, the Secretary of State  is  to

      to in the error of law Decision and any other relevant case-law;


   2. No later than 4pm on 14 October 2019, the Claimant is to file with the
      Upper Tribunal and serve on the  Secretary  of  State  a  consolidated
      bundle containing all evidence relied on in this appeal (and in  light
      of the contents of the error of law Decision). This shall  include  an
      updated  witness  statement  dealing  with  relevant  matters  (again,
      subject to what is said in the error of law Decision);

   3. No later than 4pm on 21 October 2019, the Claimant shall file with the
