                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

 1. On 18 May I wrote to the parties  proposing  the  following  course  of
    action.  No objection has been received.

 2. In the light of the history of this case and the Secretary  of  State's
    rule 24 response indicating  that  a  further  substantive  hearing  is
    desirable, I determine the appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  without  a
    hearing; I allow  the  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal;  I  remit  the
    appellant's appeal to the First-tier Tribunal;  I  direct  that  it  be
    there determined afresh by a judge other than Judge C Burns.


                                                              C M G OCKELTON
                                        VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
