Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Duharic of Morton Fraser, Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr Laverty, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

The reference to home regulator in paragraph 96(iv) of the Tier  1  Guidance
with respect to overseas financial institutions refers to the need  for  the
institution to be regulated and not to the identity of the institution  that
provides the information about the account. MM (Tier 1PSW; Art  8;  "private
life") Zimbabwe [2009] UKAIT 00037 at [12] corrected on this point.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. The appellant is a national of the USA who in  August  2007  had  been
      granted leave to enter the United Kingdom as a student.   On  30  July
      2009 she applied for leave to remain as a Tier 1 Post  Study  Migrant.
      The respondent refused the application on 26 August 2009. There was an
      appeal to the IJ that was originally  heard  on  8  October  2009  and
      adjourned over to  17  November  2009.   By  8  October  the  evidence
      presented as to her MA in animation awarded by the  Edinburgh  College
      of Art made it clear that the only issue was whether she  should  have
      been awarded points for maintenance. That has been the only issue ever
      since.


   2. In her application she had not provided personal bank  statements  for
      the prior three month period and  for  part  of  the  period  she  had
      supplied information for, the funds fell below the  minimum  required.
      Between the date of the decision and the hearing  of  the  appeal  the
      appellant lodged bank statements of a Bank of America account  in  the
      joint names of herself and her parents with  details  of  transactions
      between January and September 2009 demonstrating funds well in  excess
      of the minimum balance.  The IJ did not consider that this information
      was sufficient to comply with the Guidance issued  by  UKBA  for  post
      March 2009 applications. He adjourned the case for further information
      to be obtained from the United States. On 19 October a letter  from  a
      Bank of America customer support  officer  in  Florida  confirmed  the
      information in the bank statements previously provided.

   3. Paragraph 96 of the UKBA Guidance is in the following terms:

        "Only  the  following  specified  documents  will  be  accepted  as
        evidence of this requirement:


           i. Personal bank or building  society  statements  covering  the
              three consecutive months.


         The most recent statement must be dated no more than  one  calendar
         month before the date of application.


         The personal bank or building  society  statements  should  clearly
         show:


            . the applicant's name;
            . the account number;
            . the date of the statement;
            . the financial institution's name and logo;
            . transactions covering the three month period;
            . that there are enough funds  present  in  the  account  (then
              balance  must  always  be  at  least  �2,800  or   �800,   as
              appropriate).


         Ad hoc  bank  statements  printed  on  the  bank's  letterhead  are
         admissible as evidence  (this  excludes  min-statements  from  cash
         points).


         If the applicant wishes to submit electronic bank  statements  from
         an online account these must contain  all  of  the  details  listed
         above.   In  addition,  the  applicant  will  need  to  provide   a
         supporting letter from  his/her  bank,  on  company  headed  paper,
         confirming   the   authenticity   of   the   statements   provided.
         Alternatively an electronic bank  statement  bearing  the  official
         stamp of the bank in question will be accepted.  This stamp  should
         appear on every page of the statement.


         We will not accept statements which show the balance in the account
         on a particular day  as  these  documents  do  not  show  that  the
         applicant holds enough funds for the full period needed.


          ii. Building  society pass book covering the previous three month
              period:


        The building society pass book should clearly show:


            . the applicant's name;
            . the account number;
            . the financial institution's name and logo;
            . transactions covering the three month period;
            . that there have been enough funds present in the account (the
              balance  must  always  be  at  least  �2,800  or   �800,   as
              appropriate) covering the three month period before the  date
              of application.


         iii. Letter from bank confirming funds and that they have been  in
              the bank for at least three months:


         The letter from a bank or building society should show:


            . the applicant's name;
            . the account number;
            . the date of the letter;
            . the financial institution's name and logo;
            . the funds held in the applicant's account;
            . the funds of �2,800 or �800 have been  in  the  bank  for  at
              least three consecutive months on and immediately before  the
              date of the letter.


        The letter must be dated no more that one calendar month before the
        date of application.


        We will not accept letters which show the balance in the account on
        a particular day as these documents do not show that the  applicant
        holds enough funds for the full period needed.


          iv.  Letter  from  a  financial  institution  regulated  by   the
              Financial  Services  Authority  (FSA)  or,  in  the  case  of
              overseas accounts, the home  regulator  (official  regulatory
              body for the country in which the  institution  operates  and
              the funds are located) confirming funds:


         The  letter  from  the  financial  institution  regulated  by   the
         Financial Services Authority or home regulator should show:


            . the applicant's name;
            . the account number;
            . the date of the letter;
            . the financial institution's name and logo;
            . the funds held in the applicant's account;
            . the funds of �2,800 or �800 have been  in  the  bank  for  at
              least three consecutive months on and immediately before  the
              date of the letter.


        The letter must be dated no more that one calendar month before the
        date of application.


        We will not accept letters which show the balance in the account on
        a particular day as these documents do not show that the  applicant
        holds enough funds for the full period needed."

   4. The IJ considered that this was  a  case  to  which  paragraph  96(iv)
      applied. He accepted the submission from the Presenting  Officer  then
      appearing before him that  the  appellant  did  not  comply  with  the
      requirements of the Guidance in that she had supplied  a  letter  from
      the Bank of America but not the home regulator in the USA.

   5. At  [18] he said this:

         "As I have stated Mr Duheric's first submission was that on a close
         reading of paragraph 96 [iv] there was no  actual  requirement  for
         there to be a letter from the  Home  Regulator  and  all  that  was
         required was a  letter  from  a  financial  institution  which  was
         regulated.  I cannot accept that argument.  The way  in  which  the
         paragraph has been worded makes clear that in the case of  accounts
         originating from the United Kingdom the letter has  to  be  from  a
         financial institution regulated by the FSA but then goes onto  make
         clear that in the  case  of  overseas  accounts  an  equivalent  is
         required from the Home Regulator [official regulatory body for  the
         country in  which  the  institution  operates  and  the  funds  are
         located].  The only conclusion I can draw from that wording is that
         there is a specific requirement that a letter from a  regulator  in
         the country of origin is required."

   6. Although no authority appeared to have been relied on by either  side,
      following the hearing the IJ of his own motion identified as  relevant
      to the issues he had to decide, the case of  MM (Tier 1  PSW;  Art  8;
      "private life") Zimbabwe [2009] UKAIT 00037. In that case the AIT  was
      concerned with whether a letter from  a  Zimbabwean  Property  Company
      showing a consistent balance throughout the relevant period  could  be
      taken into account. At [12] it said this:


      "The Panel was, nevertheless, correct not to take the  document  into
          account because it does not fall within the documentation required
          by the Guidance. It relates to an "overseas account" (albeit not a
          personal bank account) and there  is  no  letter  from  the  "home
          regulator" in Zimbabwe confirming the funds as  required  by  para
          96(iv) of the Guidance."

   7. Reconsideration was ordered by SIJ  Waumsley  in  December  2009.  The
      matter now comes before us as an appeal to the UT under the Tribunals,
      Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 s.10. At the outset Mr Laverty  Senior
      Home Office Presenting Officer sought  to  withdraw  the  decision  in
      order for the respondent to re-determine it, as he submitted that  the
      Guidance  had  not  been  properly  applied  by   the   IJ   and   the
      interpretation reached was contrary to the terms of the  Guidance.  He
      recognised that under Rule 17(2)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
      Tribunal Rules) 2008 No. 2698, he required the consent  of  the  Upper
      Tribunal to do so. We indicated that we did not give that consent  and
      would determine the appeal ourselves.

   8. We do so  for  three  reasons  taking  into  account  the  over-riding
      objective to the UT Rules:

           i. Reconsideration had been ordered in December 2008 but consent
              withdraw the decision was only being sought on 30 April  2010
              after the appellant had incurred the cost  of  representation
              at this appeal.
          ii. The IJ's decision had been based on a reading of the Guidance
              that was now accepted by the respondent to have  been  wrong.
              It was important in the public interest  that  the  error  be
              brought to general attention so the parties had  the  benefit
              of a reasoned decision of the UT on the question.
         iii. The IJ's decision in part relied on some observations of  the
              AIT in MM (above) and if  that  reasoning  is  flawed  it  is
              important that the UT says so.

   9. In the circumstances it was not necessary to call  on  Mr  Duheric  to
      argue this appeal. For the reasons  given  by  Mr  Laverty,  the  IJ's
      reasons contained a material error of  law  in  the  construction  and
      application of the Guidance. We set it aside and remake the decision.


  10. In our judgment once the appellant had  demonstrated  by  satisfactory
      evidence that she had the requisite funds for the relevant  period  in
      her US bank account the appeal should have been allowed, as the  funds
      were in bank account in her name and those of her parents.  We  assume
      for the purpose of this appeal, without deciding the matter, that  the
      Guidance forms part of the Immigration Rules and can be  a  source  of
      mandatory obligations on claimants, as the  AIT  determined  in  NA  &
      Others (Tier 1 Post-Study work - funds) [2009] UKAIT 00025.

  11. The meaning of Immigration Rules  and  published  Guidance  is  to  be
      interpreted in the light of the plain words used, the context  of  the
      words and the apparent purpose of the document taken as a  whole  (see
      Ahmed Mahad (Ethiopia) v ECO [2009] UKSC 16 at [10]). Paragraph  96(i)
      of the Guidance deals  with  claims  where  the  appellant  relies  on
      evidence of statements of bank or building society accounts; paragraph
      96(ii) deals with building society  passbooks  and  paragraph  96(iii)
      concerns cases where the claimant relies  not  on  a  statement  or  a
      passbook but on a letter  from  the  bank  or  building  society.   By
      context, therefore, paragraph 96(iv) is  dealing  with  accounts  with
      other financial  institutions.  The  initial  words  of  Paragraph  96
      indicate that  it  is  dealing  with  a  list  of  separate  specified
      alternative documents rather than a series of cumulative requirements.

  12. Bank of America is a bank and the bank statements were not  electronic
      bank statements from  an  on-line  account.  Paragraph  96(i)  of  the
      Guidance applied and there was no need for  a  letter  for  a  further
      letter from the Bank confirming what was set out in the statements  at
      all.

  13. The same result would have followed if the  appellant  had  chosen  to
      rely on a letter from a bank under paragraph 96 (iii)  as  the  letter
      from the bank confirmed all the material requirements for  the  period
      required by the Guidance. For the avoidance of doubt we  observe  that
      the reference to "the letter must be dated no more than  one  calendar
      month before the date of the application" concerns the  earliest  date
      in which it can be submitted and not the latest. As the AIT  has  made
      clear  in NA  at [66]-[67] fresh evidence relating to the position  at
      the date of the decision is admissible in in-country appeals  pursuant
      to s. 85(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

  14. Accordingly, this was not a case where paragraph 96(iv) was in play at
      all, and the question of  a  home  regulator  was  irrelevant  to  the
      determination of this  appeal.   The  submissions  of  the  Presenting
      Officer at the hearing before the IJ were contrary to the plain  words
      of the Guidance. We were informed by Mr Laverty  at  the  appeal  that
      they did not reflect the policy of UKBA either.

  15. The passage from MM (Zimbabwe) cited above was not concerned with bank
      statements at all and was therefore strictly irrelevant to  the  issue
      in this case. However, insofar as the  AIT  in  that  case  discounted
      reliance on a statement from a financial institution other than a bank
      because it was not contained in a letter from  a  home  regulator,  we
      conclude that that passage mis-states the effect of  paragraph  96(iv)
      of the Guidance.

  16. The  paragraph  refers  to  a  letter  from  a  financial  institution
      regulated by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). We  have  already
      explained that this must mean a financial  institution  other  than  a
      bank. The FSA does not regulate overseas accounts, so in the  case  of
      overseas financial institutions other than  a  bank,  the  institution
      should be regulated by someone else. This is the home regulator  which
      is then defined by the words in brackets as  the  official  regulatory
      body for the country in which the institution operates and  the  funds
      are located.  Read as whole and in the light of the  other  paragraphs
      of the Guidance, and by reference to the  clear  wording  relating  to
      institutions regulated by the FSA, in our judgment it  is  clear  that
      the Guidance is referring to who should regulate  the  institution  in
      question, but not who should provide the  details  about  the  account
      held at that institution.

  17.  The next  sentence  following  the  underlined  words  reflects  this
      despite the absence of punctuation, but we add brackets to the text in
      order to  indicate the way in which these requirements should be read:

           "The letter from the financial  institution  (regulated  by  the
           Financial Services Authority or home regulator) should show...."


      Again the "or" is the alternative regulator not alternative author  of
      the letter. What follows is a  list  of  requirements  that  financial
      institutions could provide but not regulators of  those  institutions.
      As Mr Duhavic's written submissions in support  of  this  appeal  make
      clear, the home regulator would not be in a position  to  provide  the
      information then set out. To construe the Guidance in  a  manner  that
      would make compliance with it practically impossible for anyone caught
      by it is to mis-construe it.


  18.  The appeal is allowed. We direct that the appellant  be  granted  two
      years leave to remain, which  is  the  period  she  should  have  been
      granted once she produced the relevant financial information.  We  are
      grateful to both representatives for the clarity and economy of  their
      written and oral submissions that enabled us to indicate  the  outcome
      to this appeal on 30 April 2010.
