For the Appellant:     Mr Jaffar of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Miss Isherwood


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant born on 28th April 1989 is a citizen of Sri  Lanka.   The
    Appellant who was present was represented by Mr Jaffar of Counsel.  The
    Respondent was represented by Miss Isherwood, a Home Office  Presenting
    Officer.

Substantive Issues under Appeal

 2. The Appellant had entered the United Kingdom as a  Tier  4  Student  in
    2010 and had completed a degree course at the University of Sunderland.
     She had then enrolled in 2012 on an ACCA course at  BPP  College.   In
    February 2013 she applied for further  leave  to  remain  in  order  to
    complete that course.  Her application was refused on 11th April  2013
    by the Respondent.  The Appellant had appealed that  decision  and  the
    appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Widdup sitting at  Hatton
    Cross on 24th April 2014.  The judge  allowed  the  Appellant's  appeal
    under Article 8 of the ECHR.

 3. The Respondent appealed that decision in an application dated 21st  May
    2014.

 4. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Andrew on
    2nd June 2014 on the basis that it was arguable that the  judge  should
    not have allowed the case under Article 8 in light of case law.

 5. Directions were issued and the matter comes before me to decide on  the
    question of error of law in accordance with those directions.

The Respondent's Submissions

 6. Miss Isherwood relied upon the Respondent's application  and  submitted
    that the judge had materially misdirected himself under Article 8 and I
    was referred to the case law of Haleemudeen, MF  (Nigeria),  and  Patel
    [2013].

 7.  It  was  accepted  by  Miss  Isherwood  as  the  documents   and   the
    determination disclosed that the single issue under which the Appellant
    failed is that for a period of one day the required balance  of  �1,600
    fell below that figure by the sum of �56.

Submissions on behalf of the Appellant

 8. Mr Jaffar distinguished Patel on the basis  that  Patel  was  concerned
    with post-study work migrants rather than as in this case an individual
    who was in the middle of a course of study that ended in December 2014.
     The Appellant at the time  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing  had
    claimed to have exams to sit in June and December.  I ascertained  from
    the Appellant that she had indeed sat those exams in June although  the
    results were yet to be issued.  Mr Jaffar referred me to  the  case  of
    Nasim [2014] UKUT 25 who had made reference at paragraph 41 to the case
    of CDS.  It was further submitted that the judge was clearly  aware  of
    the case of Patel and a reading of  the  determination  also  disclosed
    that he had found exceptional circumstances as to why  he  allowed  the
    case under Article 8.

 9. At the conclusion of the submissions I  reserved  my  decision  on  the
    question of error of law which I now provide with my reasons.

Decision and Reasons

10. The judge in this case had the benefit of  hearing  evidence  from  the
    Appellant and her aunt, Mrs Naminthan, as well as considering  all  the
    documentary evidence.  This was a case where the  issue  concerned  the
    monies available within the Appellant's bank account for  the  relevant
    period.  Prior to the hearing there had been a few concerns raised  but
    it is apparent from paragraph 13 and paragraph 17 of the  determination
    that the single issue that remained was the fact that  for  a  one  day
    period on 6th February 2013 the required amount of �1,600, available on
    each day over the requisite 28 day period, was short by �56.  The judge
    acknowledged that fact  at  paragraph  23  of  his  determination.   He
    further accepted that that shortfall meant the Appellant did  not  meet
    the Immigration Rules nor  that  evidential  flexibility  contained  in
    paragraph 245AA could assist the Appellant.  The judge was  correct  on
    that matter and he correctly found  her  application  under  the  Rules
    failed (paragraph 23).

11. He then properly considered whether her case could succeed  outside  of
    the Rules under Article 8 ECHR (paragraph 24).  He was clearly aware of
    the principle referred to in Patel [2013] UKSC 72 that there is no such
    concept as a "near miss principle", and that was referred to by him  in
    paragraph 25.

12. The judge  had  considered  the  Appellant's  case  nevertheless  under
    Article 8 of the ECHR by  application  of  the  test  in  Razgar.   The
    Respondent, by reference to Haleemudeen [2014]  EWCA  Civ  558  and  MF
    (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 submitted that the judge had  not  found
    "exceptional" or "compelling" circumstances  such  that  he  needed  to
    consider Article 8  outside  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   Indeed  the
    refusal letter itself did not seek to consider whether  there  were  or
    not exceptional  circumstances  outside  of  the  Rules  rejecting  the
    Appellant's claim solely on the  basis  of  her  failure  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

13. The judge made no reference to recent case law or indeed any  case  law
    within his determination.  However that is not to say the judge did not
    have in mind the principles referred to within case law quoted  by  the
    Respondent or,  more  importantly,  apply  them.   In  like  manner  as
    referred to above the judge had not by name referred  to  the  case  of
    Patel but clearly was aware of and applied the principle that there was
    no concept of a "near miss".

14. The judge had at paragraph 32 outlined  a  series  of  facts  he  found
    relevant to the Article 8 issue.  He had additional  to  those  factors
    presented in paragraph 32 also noted at paragraph 33 the credibility of
    the Appellant and her aunt both in terms of the anxiety and stress that
    this matter had placed on the Appellant and the credible  evidence,  he
    found that she would return to Sri  Lanka  at  the  conclusion  of  her
    studies in December  2014.   The  judge  was  entitled  to  make  those
    credibility findings having had the benefit of  hearing  evidence  from
    the Appellant and her witness.  He was entitled to note and  take  into
    account the level of anxiety and stress that had been occasioned to the
    Appellant who had at all times during her stay  in  the  UK  been  here
    lawfully  and  complied  with  each  and  every  aspect  of  her   visa
    requirements and had clearly conscientiously  applied  herself  to  her
    studies.  As indicated above as an update to the position at  the  time
    of the First-tier Tribunal hearing the Appellant has  since  sat  those
    exams in June 2014.  The judge having outlined all those  matters  that
    he referred to in paragraphs 32 and 33 had as apparent in paragraph  35
    also been clearly mindful of the public interest and the due regard  to
    be had for the Respondent's  position.   However  as  he  indicated  in
    paragraph 35 he found this to be an exceptional case.

15. The determination indicates that the judge was  aware  of  the  current
    case law and approach to be adopted in such cases even though  he  made
    no specific reference to individual cases.  He was not bound to do  so.
    He correctly identified the  Appellant  failed  under  the  Immigration
    Rules and correctly identified  that  evidential  flexibility  did  not
    assist the Appellant.  He also  correctly  identified  the  lack  of  a
    doctrine of near miss.  Thereafter  for  reasons  provided  within  the
    determination he found the Appellant's case to be an  exceptional  case
    and having found that then applied the test  of  Razgar  and  concluded
    that in the exceptional circumstances of this case a removal  would  be
    disproportionate.

16. In those circumstances the approach adopted by the judge is  consistent
    with the approach now suggested by case  law.   Lord  Carnwath  in  his
    judgment in Patel, in reference to One-Stop Procedures refer to Jackson
    LJ's comments that the law in this field is "an impenetrable jungle  of
    intertwined  statutory  provisions  and  judicial   decisions".    Such
    position may indeed go beyond simply the One-Stop Procedures and infect
    this particular area of the law.  There is nothing to suggest the judge
    in this case has departed from  what  may  be  considered  the  central
    principles that new case law seeks to define when looking at Article  8
    of the ECHR outside of the post-9th July 2012 Immigration Rules.

17. There was no material error of law made in this  case.   Whilst  it  is
    ultimately a  matter  for  the  Respondent  in  granting  a  period  of
    discretionary leave the evidence indicates that such leave  would  only
    need to be granted exceptionally  until  December  2014  to  allow  the
    Appellant time to complete her final exams.

Decision

18. There was no material error of law made in this case and I  uphold  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal.
