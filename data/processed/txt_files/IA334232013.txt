                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by McGlashan
Mackay, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Handley, promulgated on 1 May 2014, dismissing his appeal against
    refusal of his application for leave to remain on  the  grounds  of  10
    years' residence.

 2. I am obliged  to  both  representatives  for  identifying  clearly  the
    relevant features of the immigration history and the Immigration Rules.



 3. The respondent's refusal letter  dated  23  July  2013  held  that  the
    appellant's period of continuous lawful residence was first broken from
    6 October 2007 to 17 August 2008.  However, in a letter  of  5  October
    2007 the respondent had explained to the appellant that he had 28  days
    to return his application in a manner complying with requirements.  Mrs
    O'Brien acknowledged the force of the arguments for  the  appellant  in
    respect of the period specifically discounted in  the  refusal  letter.
    The judge went wrong by  considering  a  point  in  relation  to  leave
    extended under section 3C of the 1971 Act.  It was overlooked that  the
    appellant's application of 1 November 2007 was made within  the  period
    of 28 days which falls to be disregarded under paragraph 276B(v) of the
    Rules.

 4. Mr Winter acknowledged that there is  a  further  doubtful  period  not
    specifically addressed in the  refusal  letter  or  the  determination,
    although it appears in the immigration history.  The appellant made  an
    application on 28 November 2009, rejected on 21  March  2010.   Another
    unsuccessful application was eventually followed by  a  successful  one
    made on 24 February 2011.  This resulted in leave from 24 June 2011  to
    24 June 2013.  Mr Winter referred to a letter from the respondent dated
    15 June 2011 in response to the appellant's stated  intention  to  seek
    judicial review.  This letter says:

      Due to the genuine attempts made by yourself to extend your  leave  to
      remain ... and because of the length of time ... between submission of
      your applications and the rejection of them it has been agreed that we
      can exceptionally award points for immigration status ...

      ... We have noted your reasons for  requesting  a  reconsideration  of
      your application and in light of your assertions we have exceptionally
      decided to reconsider our decision of 15 April 2011.  This decision to
      exceptionally reconsider your application in no way sets  a  precedent
      for future applications.

 5. This later period is not analysed  in  the  refusal  letter,  no  doubt
    because the decision maker thought that the earlier break in continuity
    was decisive.  Mrs O'Brien submitted that the letter of  15  June  2011
    does not commit the respondent to  waive  the  issue  of  that  gap  in
    residence for purposes of a long residence application.   She  accepted
    that  the  respondent  should  have  considered  UKBA  guidance,   Long
    Residence  and  Private  Life,  v  3.O,  valid  from  11   July   2012.
    Exceptional reasons to overlook breaks in lawful residence for purposes
    of long residence applications may  include  "an  administrative  error
    made by the UKBA" (page 15).

 6. The respondent has not considered in this case whether to exercise that
    discretion.  That would have to be approached in the light of the whole
    history, the letter of 15 June 2011, and the terms of the guidance.  To
    that extent the decision under  appeal  is  defective,  and  a  further
    decision by the Secretary of State is required.

 7. The determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside.   The
    following decision is  substituted:   the  appeal  is  allowed  on  the
    grounds that the decision appealed against is not  in  accordance  with
    the law.

 8. No anonymity order has been requested or made.
