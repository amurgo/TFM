Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr I Ahmed (MA Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    M C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The first appellant is the mother of the second and  third  appellants.
    They are all citizens of Pakistan.  Their sponsor  is  Mr  Amjad  Khan.
    They appeal the decisions dated 4 August 2014 to refuse leave to  enter
    as the spouse and children of the  sponsor.   The  respondent  was  not
    satisfied that the first named appellant  (hereinafter  the  appellant)
    met the financial requirements of the Rules.  This was the  only  point
    taken against the appellant.  There was a review of the decision by the
    Entry Clearance Manager on 12 November 2014.  It was felt that  no  new
    documentary evidence had been submitted with the appeal to address  the
    issues raised.

2.   The judge heard oral evidence from the sponsor and it is  fair  to  say
    that she did not find him to be a credible witness.  She indicated that
    he was evasive and had failed to address inconsistencies.  In paragraph
    14 the judge noted that the sponsor said he had arrived in this country
    in 1996.  He was granted indefinite leave to remain  on  the  basis  of
    fourteen years' continuous residence.  In the application  in  2011  he
    had said "his family in the UK are all the family he has".   The  judge
    found  that  the  sponsor  had  failed  to  reveal  when  he  made  his
    application for indefinite leave to remain that he had a wife  and  two
    children in Pakistan.  The letter clearly stated that the  only  family
    which the sponsor had  were  those  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  this
    significantly damaged his credibility.

3.   In paragraph 15 the judge refers to  a  determination  relating  to  an
    appeal by the appellants against the refusal of entry clearance to  the
    UK as visitors  following  applications  made  in  2009.   The  judge's
    decision continues as follows:

         "16. In the grounds of appeal submitted by the first  Appellant  to
             the Tribunal in relation to the visit visa appeal in paragraph
             3 it states "I mentioned in visa application form  that  I  am
             living with my husband and two sons in  Pakistan."   Again  in
             paragraph 6 it states that the first Appellant "is  a  married
             woman having husband and two children in  Pakistan".   In  the
             determination at paragraph 9 it states that in the grounds the
             first Appellant "says her husband works in the medical  store,
             with a monthly income of  Rs  10,000".   At  paragraph  11  it
             states "There is also evidence from the  Khan  Medical  Store,
             supporting the assertion of the  [first]  Appellant  that  her
             husband is employed there and with the income as claimed."


         17.  In his witness statement prepared for the second hearing,  the
             Sponsor said that the Appellants' applications and grounds  of
             appeal for the family visit visa were prepared by an agent and
             the first Appellant was not aware of the information  provided
             in support of the applications.  It states that  the  contents
             of the applications and grounds of appeal were  not  explained
             to the first Appellant and she was  just  asked  to  sign  the
             papers.  At the second hearing he  said  that  the  agent  was
             "Afzel Beg", but he said that he had no  proof  of  this,  and
             said that it  had  all  been  done  in  Pakistan.   The  first
             Appellant's witness statement says that  the  application  was
             prepared by an agent  "who  has  never  explained  to  me  the
             contents  of  our  application  and  the  grounds  of   appeal
             submitted hereafter".
         18.  I do not find this to be a credible explanation.  First I find
             on the balance of probabilities that the first  Appellant  was
             not entirely honest in her reasons for wanting to come to  the
             United Kingdom in 2009.  It may well be  that  she  wanted  to
             visit relatives, but I find on the  balance  of  probabilities
             that the main reason she came to the  United  Kingdom  was  to
             visit the Sponsor.  He said at  the  second  hearing  that  he
             could not sponsor the visit because he did not have status  at
             the time.


         19.  Secondly, the Appellants applied for a visit visa to  visit  a
             relation living in the United Kingdom.  He was present at  the
             hearing in 2010.  The  Sponsor  now  says  that  the  evidence
             provided was not genuine  and  the  Appellants  did  not  know
             anything about it, but I find it lacks  credibility  that  the
             sponsor on  that  occasion  would  not  have  known  that  the
             information provided was false, and that the first Appellant's
             husband was not working in Pakistan  but  was  living  in  the
             United Kingdom.  I have no evidence from the sponsor  on  that
             occasion to explain what had happened at the previous  hearing
             and why the evidence is so contrary to what is  before  me  on
             this occasion.


         20.  Thirdly, I find that the grounds of appeal for the visit  visa
             application state that the first Appellant was  working  as  a
             schoolteacher.  The Sponsor was asked at the  hearing  whether
             his wife had ever worked as a schoolteacher and  he  confirmed
             that she did.  Even if I accept that the notice of appeal  was
             prepared by an agent, I find on the balance  of  probabilities
             that there is information in the grounds of appeal  which  was
             provided to the agent by the first Appellant.  If all  of  the
             information was incorrect and merely made up by the  agent,  I
             find it is surprising that the  agent  just  happens  to  have
             decided to state that the first Appellant  was  working  as  a
             schoolteacher.  I find on the balance  of  probabilities  that
             the first Appellant was aware of the information given to  the
             Respondent relating to the Sponsor's employment, and was aware
             that false documents were provided in order to corroborate it.


         21.  At the hearing the Sponsor provided photographs taken when the
             Appellants came to the United Kingdom to see him in  2010.   I
             find on the balance of probabilities that the Sponsor  was  in
             the United Kingdom at the time and that therefore he  and  the
             Appellants deliberately provided false documents in  order  to
             give the impression that the Sponsor was living and working in
             Pakistan, which would mean that there was more  likelihood  of
             the applications being successful as the Appellants would have
             been able to claim that they had an  incentive  to  return  to
             Pakistan at the end of their visit."

4.   The judge concluded that the circumstances of the previous  visit  visa
    applications and the subsequent appeal damaged the credibility of  both
    the appellant and the sponsor.
5.   The judge then turned to consider  an  issue  concerning  the  date  of
    birth of  the  third  appellant.   Although  a  ground  of  appeal  was
    submitted in relation to the judge's findings on this matter permission
    was not granted in respect of it.  I agree that  the  judge  gave  very
    careful consideration to the evidence and a  detailed  explanation  for
    his findings on the matter and it is not necessary to set out  in  full
    this part of the decision.  The judge found  that  misleading  evidence
    had been provided and that the sponsor's credibility had been  damaged.
    The failure of the sponsor to mention prior to the  disclosure  of  the
    determination that he had seen the appellants in the United Kingdom  in
    2010 cast doubt on his credibility as it did that he  had  deliberately
    underplayed the strength of his connections with Pakistan to the extent
    of not mentioning his wife and children.  In relation to the  appellant
    the judge found as follows in paragraph 29 of the determination:

         "29. In relation to the  first  Appellant,  I  do  not  accept  her
             explanation that an agent prepared the visit visa applications
             and grounds of appeal.  I find on the balance of probabilities
             that she gave the agent information about  her  own  job,  and
             that the false information about the Sponsor was included with
             her knowledge.   The  Sponsor  gave  the  name  of  the  agent
             allegedly used, but  no  evidence  has  been  given  that  any
             complaint was made against him.  The  first  Appellant  signed
             the notice of appeal.  It is not enough for her to  claim  now
             that she did not know what  she  was  signing.   Further,  the
             agent did not represent the Appellants at the hearing  in  the
             United Kingdom.  There is  no  evidence  before  me  from  the
             family member who sponsored the visit  visa  to  explain  what
             happened at the hearing, and how the previous Tribunal came to
             be so misled by  the  evidence  provided.   I  find  that  the
             evidence of the first Appellant cannot be relied on."

6.   In relation to the financial requirements of the Immigration Rules  the
    judge stated as follows:

         "31. The Respondent's decision was delayed  pending  the  Court  of
             Appeal decision in MM and others [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985.   The
             application was made on  9  April  2013,  and  the  notice  of
             decision is dated 4 August 2014.  There was some discussion at
             the first hearing about the relevant dates, and it was  agreed
             that, given the passage of time between  the  application  and
             decision, any  6  month  period  during  this  time  would  be
             satisfactory.  It was unfortunate that the Appellants were not
             represented by the same representative on the second occasion,
             as at the second hearing, it  was  agreed  that  the  relevant
             period was a six month period in 2012/2013, prior to the  date
             of application.  However, I find that  this  is  all  somewhat
             academic, as the Sponsor has failed to provide  the  specified
             documents covering any six month  period,  either  before  the
             application or, given the delay caused by waiting for  the  MM
             decision, some later six month period prior to the decision.


         32.  In relation to his  employment,  the  Sponsor  has  failed  to
             provide an employer's letter which meets the  requirements  of
             Appendix FM-SE.  The only letter from Honeytop Foods, for whom
             the Sponsor works, is found at page 70 of  the  first  bundle.
             This is dated 13 November 2013.  It does not state his salary,
             nor therefore the period over which  he  has  been  paid  this
             salary.  It states he is with "Gold Team Agency".  At page  71
             is a letter from Goldteam Recruitment Ltd  dated  12  November
             2013 which states that the Sponsor started  work  on  23  July
             2012.  It states his hourly rate, but not how  many  hours  he
             works.  It makes no reference to Honeytop Foods.  I asked  the
             Appellants' representative at the second hearing whether there
             were any other employer's letters, and he confirmed that there
             were not.


         33.  The Appellants' representative submitted that  the  Respondent
             should have exercised evidential flexibility,  and  considered
             all of the evidence in  the  round.   I  do  not  accept  this
             argument.  Appendix FM-SE sets out the documents which must be
             provided.  Neither of these two letters meets the requirements
             of Appendix FM-SE.  Taken together, the information in them is
             not sufficient, as there is no indication of salary.  This  is
             not a points based application, so I  am  able  to  take  into
             account evidence provided after the  date  of  decision.   The
             Appellants  have  been  represented  throughout.   The   first
             Appellants' notice of decision was clear that a letter meeting
             the requirements had  not  been  provided,  and  the  specific
             requirements were set out in this  notice.   Not  attempt  has
             been made to provide a letter which meets the requirements  of
             Appendix FM-SE.  I find that the  Appellants  have  failed  to
             provide evidence in respect of the Sponsor's employment  which
             meets the requirements of Appendix FM-SE.


         34.  Further, the Appellants' representative at the second  hearing
             submitted that payslips had been provided from 8  August  2012
             to 14 February 2013.   The  P60  for  2012/2013  indicates  an
             income  of  �11,571.84.   The  employer   is   Goldteam.    If
             calculated from the payslips, the  Appellants'  representative
             submitted that the total salary was �19,436.  However, I  have
             no indication from Goldteam as to the salary the  Sponsor  was
             earning.  The tax return for 2012/2013 is not the  tax  return
             finally submitted, but indicates  that  it  is  "in  progress"
             (page 65 of the first bundle).  When asked why this  was  only
             "in progress" whereas the 2013/2014 return indicated  that  it
             had been submitted, the Sponsor said that only his  accountant
             could say why, and that all he could say was that this was the
             tax paid.  The pay from employment is �11,571 (not exactly the
             same figure as the P60).   The  pay  from  self-employment  is
             �9,179.  This amounts to �20,750, which is not enough to  meet
             the requirements of the rules.


         35.  In relation to the �9,179  earned  from  self-employment,  the
             Sponsor was asked at the second  hearing  why  there  were  no
             invoices, given that this is a significant amount of money  to
             have earned without any invoices to show for it.  He said that
             he worked for Asian people, who paid him either  with  cheques
             or cash.  He said that they never asked for invoices,  and  so
             he "did not bother to submit invoices".  I did not  find  this
             to be a satisfactory or credible answer, and I find that there
             is no evidence to back up the amount he claims to have  earned
             from self-employment.


         36.  The Sponsor was asked if he used his  saver  account  for  the
             money from self-employment, and he said that he did.   He  was
             asked why the saver account did not show  many  deposits  from
             self-employment.  He replied that he did not  know.   He  said
             that he had kept on depositing the money he  had  received  in
             this account.  He was referred to pages  131  to  138  of  the
             first bundle.  These are statements from  his  Everyday  Saver
             account covering the period 21 May 2013  to  21  August  2013,
             around the time of the application.  It was put  to  him  that
             there was very  little  money  paid  into  the  account.   The
             Sponsor said that he could not remember,  and  that  he  might
             have put some in his  current  account.   Given  his  previous
             evidence  that  he  used  the  save  account  for  his   self-
             employment,  I  did  not  find  this  to  be  a  credible   or
             satisfactory answer.


         37.  At the second hearing, the Appellants' representative referred
             to money in the current account being made from  the  sale  of
             scrap metal, and submitted that the receipts  provided  showed
             this,  which  added  to  the  Sponsor's  credibility.   I  was
             referred to the Halifax statements at page 42-43 of the second
             bundle, dated 21 November 2014 to 16 February 2015.   However,
             as I pointed out at the hearing, this evidence post-dated  the
             decision, and I did not  see  how  this  was  relevant  to  my
             consideration of the Sponsor's self-employment income prior to
             the   decision.    The   Sponsor's   credibility   cannot   be
             significantly enhanced by showing that he can now  demonstrate
             the source  of  his  earnings,  given  the  lack  of  invoices
             relating to his self-employment for the relevant period.


         38.  I find  that  the  Sponsor  has  failed  to  provide  reliable
             evidence of his  self-employment  income.   I  find  that  the
             Sponsor has failed to show that he was  earning  the  required
             amount to sponsor his wife and sons.


         39.  Taking all the above into  account,  I  find  that  the  first
             Appellant has failed to show on the balance  of  probabilities
             that she meets the requirements of the immigration  rules.   I
             therefore find that  the  second  and  third  Appellants  have
             failed to demonstrate that they meet the requirements  of  the
             immigration rules."

7.   In relation to Article 8 the judge refers to  Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27.
    He accepted that the sponsor and appellant were married and  that  they
    had been living apart since (on  the  sponsor's  evidence)  1996.   The
    appellants had only visited the sponsor once in 2010  and  the  sponsor
    had visited the appellants once in 2012.  There was nothing to  prevent
    further visits taking place and the decisions did  not  interfere  with
    family life.  If there was family life between the appellants  and  the
    sponsor any interference would be in accordance with the law and  would
    be proportionate.  The judge sets out her assessment of proportionality
    as follows:

         "43. I have taken into account in my assessment of  proportionality
             all of my findings in relation to the applications made  under
             the immigration rules.  I have taken into account my  findings
             as to the credibility of the Sponsor and the first  Appellant.
             I have taken into account the conduct of the  first  Appellant
             who misled the Respondent and the Tribunal in the  process  of
             applying for, and appealing against the refusal of, the  visit
             visas in 2009.  I have taken into account the conduct  of  the
             Sponsor who spent  14  years  living  in  the  United  Kingdom
             without leave to remain, and who also  misled  the  Respondent
             when applying for indefinite leave to remain by  stating  that
             his only family were his  relatives  in  the  United  Kingdom,
             failing to mention his  family  in  Pakistan.   He  showed  no
             respect for the immigration laws  of  the  United  Kingdom  by
             entering illegally and remaining without leave for a prolonged
             period of time.


         44.  In assessing the public interest I  have  taken  into  account
             section 19 of the Immigration Act 2014 which  inserted  a  new
             section 117B into the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
             2002, so far as is relevant.  Section 117B(1) states that "The
             maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public
             interest."


         45.  The Respondent was satisfied that the first Appellant met  the
             English  language  requirements  of  the   immigration   rules
             (section 117B(2)).  I have found above that the Appellants  do
             not meet the financial requirements of the  immigration  rules
             (section 117B(3)).  The Sponsor  has  failed  to  provide  the
             specified documents, and the evidence of the Sponsor's  income
             from self-employment cannot be relied on.  This is not a  case
             where I have found that the Sponsor is  earning  a  sufficient
             amount, but  has  failed  to  provide  the  precise  documents
             required by the Respondent.  Sections 117B(4) and 117B(6)  are
             not relevant.


         46.  I find that the Sponsor  and  the  first  Appellant  chose  to
             conduct their family life  with  the  Sponsor  living  in  the
             United  Kingdom,  and  the   Appellants   in   Pakistan.    No
             explanation has been given as to  why  the  Sponsor  left  his
             family in Pakistan.  The Appellants have been living  together
             as a family unit without the Sponsor for over  18  years  now.
             During this period of time, they have seen  the  Sponsor  only
             twice.   This  was  through  choice.   The  second  and  third
             Appellants  are  now  adults,  or  alternatively   the   third
             Appellant is nearly an adult.  They will be living  their  own
             independent lives.


         47.  I find that any family life can continue as it has been  doing
             for  the  past   18   years,   through   modern   methods   of
             communication, and  through  the  Sponsor  visiting  Pakistan.
             Alternatively, there is nothing preventing  the  Sponsor  from
             returning to live in Pakistan to be with the  Appellants.   He
             is a citizen of Pakistan, he speaks the language, as shown  by
             his use of interpreters at the hearings, and he has spent  all
             of his life in Pakistan, apart from the last 18 years when  he
             chose to live in the United Kingdom,  without  leave  for  the
             first 14 years.  I find that he has family,  social,  cultural
             and linguistic ties to Pakistan.


         48.  There is a significant public interest in refusing  permission
             to enter to those persons who do not meet the requirements  of
             the immigration rules.  I find, taking into account all of the
             circumstances of the Appellants, my  credibility  findings  in
             respect of the Sponsor and first Appellant,  and  the  way  in
             which they have misled the Respondent and the Tribunal in  the
             past, that the Appellants have failed to show on  the  balance
             of probabilities  that  the  decisions  are  breach  of  their
             rights, or those of  the  Sponsor,  to  a  family  life  under
             Article 8 ECHR, or indeed any other rights  protected  by  the
             Human Rights Act 1998."

8.   There was an application for permission to appeal  and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal granted permission on 8 March 2016 and  permission  to  appeal
    was granted on limited grounds.  Permission was granted to  argue  that
    the judge  had  erred  in  considering  the  relevant  period  for  the
    consideration of the sponsor's  employment  and  self-employment.   The
    relevant period was 2013/2014 it was submitted and not 2012/2013.   The
    judge had erred at paragraph 34 in failing  to  consider  evidence  for
    what was submitted to be the relevant period - 2013/2014.  The  sponsor
    had been earning �25,097 and not �20,750.

9.   The judge had erred in presuming that the sponsor had  failed  to  give
    details of the appellants in his own application for  indefinite  leave
    to remain.  The respondent had  not  provided  all  the  pages  of  the
    sponsor's application.

10.  It was further argued that the judge had  misconceived  the  fact  that
    the sponsor  was  present  at  the  hearing  in  paragraph  19  of  her
    determination.  This related to the appeal in 2010.

11.  A response was filed drafted by Mr Avery on 17 March 2016  in  relation
    to the finances issue it was  submitted  by  the  respondent  that  the
    correct position was "That the evidence must relate to the  six  months
    prior to the date of application.  In  any  event  the  judge  was  not
    satisfied that the evidence provided met the requirements  of  Appendix
    FM-SE."

12.  In relation to the argument about the  attendance  at  the  visit  visa
    hearing it was submitted that this was based on a simple misreading  of
    the determination.  The judge was saying that it was the  relative  who
    sponsored the visit application who was present.

13.  It was submitted by Mr  Ahmed  that  on  the  chronology  the  relevant
    period was 2013/2014 and not 2012/2013.  I pointed out that it had been
    agreed  at  the  hearing  when  Mr  Ahmed  had  been  representing  the
    appellants  that  the  relevant  period  was  a  six  month  period  in
    2012/2013.  Mr Ahmed said  that  must  have  been  a  misunderstanding.
    There had been a review in November 2014 and the decision had  been  in
    August 2014.  The judge had been entitled  to  take  into  account  the
    later evidence because of the delay caused by the appeal  in  MM.   The
    only issue had been maintenance.  There was the question of  evidential
    flexibility and Mr Ahmed referred me  to  the  Immigration  Directorate
    Instructions.  The respondent had a  discretion  in  the  matter.   The
    respondent should have asked the appellant to  provide  evidence.   The
    appellant had been employed by one  employer  throughout  although  the
    employer's name had changed.  By March 2015 he was  paid  �30,000.   It
    was postdecision evidence relevant to the date of decision.   Mr  Ahmed
    sought to  rely  on  fresh  evidence  relating  to  the  birth  of  the
    appellant's son.  I noted that permission had not been given  to  argue
    this ground and it appeared no notice had been given about the proposed
    fresh evidence.

14.  Mr Avery submitted in relation to the financial  requirements  that  it
    had been agreed at the second hearing that the relevant  period  was  a
    six month period in 2012/2013.  This related to the  six  month  period
    prior to the application which was what the Rules said. Because of  the
    delay the respondent had looked  at  the  further  evidence  submitted.
    This was a generous stance but the judge was confined to  the  evidence
    for the six month period prior to the application.  This did not comply
    with Appendix FM-SE.  The appellants had not pointed to  any  compliant
    evidence.  As the judge had said in paragraph 32 of  her  determination
    the letters did not meet the requirements.  The  deficiencies  had  not
    been made good.  Any material not mentioned had not been relevant.  The
    evidence did not meet the requirements for evidential flexibility to be
    exercised.  There had been no error in the judge's approach.   She  had
    dealt with the employment issues.   There  had  been  issues  with  the
    evidence and she had been entitled to conclude that  the  evidence  was
    not  satisfactory.   It  was  relevant  to  note  that   the   negative
    credibility assessment made by  the  judge  called  into  question  the
    reliability of any evidence that had been provided.  The key  issue  of
    the funds had been dealt with correctly.  There  was  no  flaw  in  the
    decision relating to Article 8 and permission had  not  been  given  to
    argue the question about the date of the birth of the child.

15.  In reply Mr Ahmed submitted that the relevant dates would  go  back  to
    2011/2012 if one was looking at the position prior to  the  application
    and the appeal should be remitted and heard afresh.  It  would  not  be
    practical to make a fresh application because  the  children  would  be
    over 18.

16.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I  remind
    myself that I can only interfere with the decision if it was materially
    flawed in law.

17.  In  relation  to  the  financial  requirements  the  judge  records  in
    paragraph  31  that  on  the  second  occasion  -  when  Mr  Ahmed  was
    representing the appellants - it was agreed that  the  relevant  period
    was a six month period in 2012/2013, prior to the date of  application.
    Mr Ahmed submitted that this was a  mistake  or  misunderstanding.   Mr
    Ahmed told me that he had had a hand in drafting the grounds of  appeal
    and  there  was  no  reference  in  the  grounds  to  any  mistake   or
    misunderstanding about what the judge had been  told  as  reflected  in
    paragraph 31 of the decision.  As Mr Avery points  out  the  submission
    was entirely correct.  The judge was to focus at the  period  prior  to
    the date of application.

18.  The judge was criticised for not taking into account all  the  material
    before her.  She found that an employer's letter had not been filed  to
    meet the relevant requirements of Appendix FM-SE.  She  refers  to  the
    salient material and asked  Mr  Ahmed  whether  there  were  any  other
    employers' letters and he confirmed that there were not.

19.  In relation to evidential flexibility she  gave  consideration  to  the
    question in paragraph 33.  The judge was entitled to  conclude  that  a
    letter  meeting  the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE  had  not  been
    provided.

20.  I was referred to DR (Morocco) [2005] UKIAT 00038.  The issue  in  that
    case was whether the parties intended to live together as man and wife.
     The Adjudicator had found that the  postdecision  evidence  showed  "a
    continuing and subsisting relationship" and  the  Tribunal  interpreted
    this as showing that the later evidence satisfied the Adjudicator  that
    as at the date of the Entry Clearance Officer's decision the couple did
    indeed genuinely intend to live together  as  husband  and  wife.   The
    issue is different in this case.  When the judge refers in paragraph 33
    to her ability to take into account evidence provided after the date of
    decision no doubt she had DR (Morocco) in mind.

21.  Quite apart from the fact that the  judge  had  been  referred  to  the
    2012/2013  period  by  Mr  Ahmed  she  considered  that  the  specified
    documents had not been provided covering any six  month  period  either
    before the application or some six month period prior to the decision.

22.  This is in my view a very  careful  and  detailed  decision  where  the
    judge went fully into all the circumstances and made  detailed  adverse
    credibility findings.  As Mr Avery points out, the reliability  of  the
    documentary evidence  needed  to  be  viewed  in  the  light  of  these
    findings.

23.  In relation to the criticism of the judge's credibility assessment,  it
    is said that her findings in paragraph 14 were flawed in  that  it  had
    been presumed that the sponsor had failed to give details of the spouse
    and children in his own application for indefinite leave to remain.   I
    do not find that the judge  made  any  such  presumption.   She  simply
    referred to the covering letter and what it stated  thereon.   She  was
    entitled to conclude that the letter damaged the sponsor's credibility.
     There was indeed ample foundation for the judge's negative credibility
    assessment  in  a  meticulous  sifting  of  the  evidence,   oral   and
    documentary.  The sponsor was found to be an evasive  witness  and  the
    judge explains fully and satisfactorily why he made this impression  on
    her.

24.  This was not a case where evidential flexibility  could  have  assisted
    the appellants.   In  relation  to  the  point  taken  in  relation  to
    paragraph 19 of the determination  I  agree  with  Mr  Avery  that  the
    argument is misconceived in that  the  reference  to  presence  at  the
    hearing in 2010 relates to the relation then sponsoring the visit  visa
    application.

25.  Turning to Article 8 permission  was  not  given  to  argue  the  issue
    relating to the son's date of birth.  It  was  said  that  the  judge's
    decision was disproportionate in failing to look at all the evidence in
    the round in the light of the doctrine of evidential flexibility.

26.  I am satisfied that  the  judge  approached  the  issue  of  Article  8
    correctly in the light of the guidance in Razgar.  The judge noted when
    making her proportionality assessment  that  there  was  a  significant
    public interest in refusing permission to enter to those  who  did  not
    meet the requirements of the  Rules  and  she  took  into  account  her
    credibility assessment and the way  in  which  the  sponsor  and  first
    appellant had misled the respondent and the Tribunal.

27.  The judge considered all the relevant and salient evidence  put  before
    her and reached conclusions under the Rules and in relation to  Article
    8 that were open to her.  I am not persuaded  there  was  any  material
    error of law in the decision as contended and this appeal is dismissed.

28.  The appeals under the Immigration Rules are dismissed.

29.  The appeals are dismissed on human rights grounds.

30.  No anonymity order made.

31.  In relation to fee award the judge made no fee award and I make none.
