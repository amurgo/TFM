                                                                  Respondent

For the Respondent:    Mr Mullen, Senior Presenting Officer

                         NOTIFICATION OF WITHDRAWAL

 1. The appellant appealed against  a  determination  by  Designated  Judge
    Murray, promulgated on 22 July 2013.  The Presenting Officer sought  to
    withdraw the respondent's case, with a view to making a fresh decision.
     The appellant did not oppose  that  course,  and  indicated  that  the
    relevant up to date circumstances have already been made known  to  the
    respondent.  (The appellant and his partner remain in  a  relationship,
    and now have a child.)

 2. In terms of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  Rule
    17, the respondent's case is recorded as having been  withdrawn  orally
    at the hearing, with the consent of the Upper Tribunal.  The matter  is
    now before the respondent for further decision.
