Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Ofei Kwatia, counsel (instructed by S-K
Solicitors)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. I shall refer to the appellant as "the secretary of state" and to  the
      respondent as "the claimant."


   2. The claimant is a national of Pakistan born on 10 December  1962.  His
      appeal against the  decision  of  the  secretary  of  state  dated  15
      November 2014 revoking his residence card which had been issued to him
      as an extended family  member  of  an  EEA  national  under  the  2006
      Regulations was allowed by the First-tier Tribunal Judge in a decision
      promulgated on 30 July 2015.


   3. The background was  as  follows.  The  claimant  had  been  granted  a
      residence card valid until June 2016 as the family member  of  an  EEA
      national exercising Treaty rights in the UK.


   4. On returning from Pakistan on 15 November 2014  he  was  arrested  and
      detained and was served with a notice of his intended removal from the
      UK on 30 November 2014. As noted, his leave was also curtailed.


   5. The claimant was given an in country right of appeal under  Regulation
      26 of the 2006 Regulations. In due course he was granted bail  and  it
      is common ground that his  sponsor  stood  surety  for  him.  His  EEA
      partner was a Polish national. She passed away in Poland  on  5  April
      2015. He had been granted his residence permit on the  basis  that  he
      was in a durable relationship and  his  partner  had  been  exercising
      Treaty rights [5].


   6.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  allowed  the  appellant's   appeal   under
      Regulation 10(2) of the 2006 Regulations.


   7. Regulation 10 sets out the requirements regarding a family member  who
      has retained the right of residence. This means a person who satisfies
      the conditions in sub paragraph 2, 3, 4 or 5.


   8. Regulation 10(2) provides that a person satisfies  the  conditions  in
      this paragraph if:


     a) he was a family member of a qualified person or of an EEA  national
        with a permanent right of residence when that person died;


     b) he resided in the UK in accordance with these  Regulations  for  at
        least a year immediately prior to the death of the qualified person
        or the EEA national with a permanent right of residence; and


     c) he satisfies the condition in paragraph 10(6).


   9. The appeal was presented on the basis that the claimant was  a  family
      member of a qualified person. It was also contended that he resided in
      the UK in accordance with  the  Regulations  for  at  least  the  year
      immediately before the death of his partner. There is no dispute  that
      he satisfied the conditions in paragraph 10(6).


  10. In his findings of fact, the First-tier Tribunal Judge found that  his
      EEA partner died in Poland on 5 April 2015 [8].


  11. In considering whether the EEA sponsor was exercising Treaty rights in
      the UK, the judge had regard to the following evidence.


     a) He referred to the employment documents relating  to  the  sponsor.
        These he set out in full at [8]. The  claimant's  sponsor  asserted
        that she had been self employed at all relevant times.


     b) Documents were provided by HMRC showing the years in which she  had
        been self employed.


     c) Insofar as the tax years 2009-10 to 2013-14 are concerned, she  had
        been self employed carrying out cleaning  services  and  her  gross
        profit is set out in the statement of the HMRC officer.  These  are
        set out from pages 59 onwards of the appellant's bundle.


     d) There was also a letter from the  sponsor's  accountants  dated  12
        December 2014. This confirmed that Mrs Kierpiec  (the  sponsor)  is
        self employed and trading as a cleaning service since 10 July 2009.
        She is registered  with  HMRC  for  self  assessment  and  Class  2
        National Insurance contributions.  Her net income before Income Tax
        and Class 4 National Insurance for the year ended 5 April 2013  was
        �8,125 and for the year ended 5 April 2012, �7,185.  On 12 December
        2014, all the due income tax and National  Insurance  contributions
        were paid.


     e) They state that further  to  her  visit  to  their  offices  on  21
        November 2014, she informed them that  she  had  resumed  her  self
        employment from 21 November 2014. She told them that  she  had  not
        been working from the second week of June 2014 to 21 November 2014.




  12. Based on that evidence, he accepted that the  claimant's  sponsor  was
      exercising Treaty rights in the UK when the claimant returned  to  the
      UK. He had been out of the UK from August 2014 to  November  2014  [8]
      and [10].


  13. He accepted that a break from the UK would not necessarily  mean  that
      she is not exercising Treaty rights, having regard  in  particular  to
      her history of self employment.


  14. The Judge also noted that when the claimant was returning to  the  UK,
      he was not accompanying his sponsor and as she was not in  the  UK  at
      the time, he was not joining  her.  Accordingly,  he  found  that  the
      secretary of state had not been obliged to allow the claimant to enter
      the  UK  with  his  residence  card.  Regulation  19(2)  of  the  2006
      Regulations provides that a person is not entitled to be  admitted  to
      the UK as the family member of an EEA national under Regulation  11(2)
      unless, at the time  of  his  arrival,  he  is  accompanying  the  EEA
      national or joining him in the UK and the EEA national has a right  to
      reside here under the 2006 Regulations.


  15. He nevertheless went on to  consider  whether  the  claimant  met  the
      criteria for being a family member  who  has  retained  the  right  of
      residence under Regulation 10 of the  2006  Regulations,  as  set  out
      above.


  16. He found that the claimant is to be regarded as a family  member  once
      he was issued with a residence card [10].


  17. He  then  considered  whether  the  claimant  resided  in  the  UK  in
      accordance with the Regulations for  at  least  the  year  immediately
      before the death of the qualified person. She died on  5  April  2015.
      The claimant stated that he had lived with her since 2009 to  the  end
      of March 2015.


  18. The Judge interpreted the phrase "he resided in the UK  in  accordance
      with these regulations for at least the year  immediately  before  the
      death of the qualified person" to mean that  the  relevant  period  of
      time which the rules had in mind was between April 2014 and April 2015
      [10]. He found that there was nothing in the  2006  Regulations  which
      stated that normal continuity under the rules should not apply in this
      case. Accordingly he found that short breaks  taken  by  either  party
      away from the UK would not mean that they were not  residing  together
      in the UK in accordance with these regulations.


  19. It appeared from the claimant's interview with the Immigration Officer
      that his partner was out of the UK from July 2014 until November 2014.
      He was out of the country between August and November 2014 [10].


  20. He considered whether that meant that both the  claimant  and  sponsor
      had not resided in the UK in  accordance  with  the  2006  Regulations
      because of the break in their stay here.


  21. He found that the break was short; and bearing in mind the  length  of
      time that they had spent together between 2009 and 2015, including the
      fact that his sponsor had been a surety at the bail hearing, the break
      in their stay in the  UK  did  not  affect  the  year  long  residence
      required under Regulation 10(2)(b).


  22. The claimant and his sponsor were in the  UK  together  between  April
      2014 and July 2014 as well as between November 2014 until  March  2015
      [10].


  23. He accordingly found that the claimant qualified as  a  family  member
      who has retained the right of residence under Regulation 10(2) of  the
      2006 Regulations.


  24. On 21 December 2015, the secretary of state was granted permission  to
      appeal to the Upper  Tribunal.  In  granting  the  appeal,  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Kelly stated that it  is  arguable  that  the  admitted
      break in both the continuity of cohabitation and the employment of the
      EEA national in the UK for a period of several months  during  the  12
      month  period  immediately  preceding  her  death,  resulted  in   the
      inability of the claimant to meet  the  requirements  for  a  retained
      right of residence under Regulation 10 of the 2006 Regulations.


  25. There has been no Rule  24  response.  Ms  Ofei-Kwatia,  who  did  not
      represent the claimant before the First-tier Tribunal noted that  from
      the claimant's passport, that he went to Pakistan between October 2014
      and November 2014 for a period of about six  weeks.  The  stamps,  she
      said, are in the passport. Despite asking the secretary of  state  for
      that passport, it has not been returned.


  26. On behalf of the secretary of state, Mr Bramble submitted that on  the
      plain meaning of Regulation 10(2)(b),  the  requirement  is  that  the
      claimant must  have  resided  in  the  UK  in  accordance  with  these
      regulations for at least the year immediately before the death of  the
      qualified person. His "wife" died in Poland on 5  April  2015.  During
      the preceding year, she spent four  months  in  Poland.  The  claimant
      himself was absent between August to November 2014.


  27. Accordingly, as stated  in  Ground  5  of  the  secretary  of  state's
      permission application, "the secretary of  state  does  not  therefore
      consider that the claimant and sponsor  resided  in  the  UK  for  the
      entire 12 month period in question." (I note that  paragraph  10(2)(b)
      provides that a person satisfies the conditions in this  paragraph  if
      he resided in the UK in accordance with these Regulations for at least
      the year immediately before the death of the qualified person.)


  28. Mr Bramble referred to Regulation 3 of the 2006 Regulations  regarding
      the calculation of periods of continuous residence  in  the  UK  under
      Regulation 5(1) and Regulation 15. The continuity of residence is  not
      affected by periods of absence not exceeding six months  in  total  in
      any year or, for example, one absence from the  UK  not  exceeding  12
      months for an important  reason  such  as  pregnancy  and  childbirth,
      serious illness, study or vocational training or an overseas posting.


  29. He submitted that this cannot apply to the claimant's situation.


  30. He referred to the definition of "qualified person"  under  Regulation
      6(c) relating to a self employed person to the effect that a person no
      longer in self employment shall not cease to  be  treated  as  a  self
      employed  person  for  the  purpose  of  paragraph  1(c)  if  she   is
      temporarily unable to pursue her activity as a self employed person as
      a result of an illness or accident. He submitted  that  that  did  not
      assist the claimant either.


  31. He submitted that in this  case  the  claimant's  sponsor  had  simply
      stopped working. She was not deceased.


  32. He also relied on Ground 3 of  the  secretary  of  state's  permission
      application and submitted that the sponsor  had  been  absent  between
      July and November 2014. This is evident from [8] and [10] of the First-
      tier Tribunal Judge's decision.


  33. On behalf of the claimant, Ms Ofei-Kwatia referred to  Article  49  of
      the Directive. Freedom of establishment shall  include  the  right  to
      take up and pursue activities  as  self  employed  persons  under  the
      conditions laid down for its own national by the law  of  the  country
      where such establishment is effected, subject to the provisions of the
      chapter relating to capital.


  34. She submitted that taking a break from self employment does not result
      in the sponsor's not being  recognised  as  "self  employed"  for  the
      purpose of the regulations.


  35. She referred to the documentation from HMRC  that  was  produced.  The
      secretary of state's contention that because she  was  away  for  four
      months, she did not remain a qualified person for the purpose  of  the
      regulations, is incorrect. The authorities have  recognised  her  self
      employment as such. She has paid her national insurance.


  36. Moreover, the claimant produced evidence of his  own  self  employment
      including his self employed Class 2 National  Insurance  contributions
      which were due on 31 January 2015.  His  self  assessment  statements,
      National Insurance contributions and  documentation  relating  to  the
      sponsor  has  been  produced.  There  is  also  the  letter  from  the
      accountant at page 48 to which I have referred. She informed them that
      she had resumed her  self  employment  from  21  November  2014.  This
      confirmed that she was still self employed at the relevant time.


  37.  She  accordingly  submitted  that  she  had  remained  self  employed
      notwithstanding the absence in Poland for several months.


  38. She referred to the second ground of appeal, namely that  the  sponsor
      had stopped working in the second week of June 2014 and did not resume
      self employment until November  2014.   The  secretary  of  state  has
      contended this meant that there was  a  period  of  over  five  months
      during which she was not exercising Treaty  rights.  Accordingly,  the
      claimant cannot be said to have been living  in  accordance  with  the
      regulations for the year immediately preceding her death.


  39. Ms Ofei-Kwatia submitted  that  there  is  nothing  in  Regulation  10
      requiring a continuity of cohabitation as implied in  paragraph  5  of
      the grounds. That is not the wording of Regulation 10.  She  submitted
      with regard to the claimant, that his six week holiday in Pakistan did
      not break the continuity.





     Assessment


  40. The First-tier Tribunal Judge has undertaken a  careful  and  detailed
      analysis of the facts relevant to the appeal. He  has  considered  the
      relevant provisions of Regulation  10  of  the  2006  Regulations.  He
      accepted that the claimant's sponsor was exercising treaty  rights  in
      the UK when the claimant returned to the UK [8].


  41. He concluded that for the purpose of Regulation 10(2)(b) short  breaks
      from the UK did not preclude "residence" in the UK. He had  regard  to
      Regulation 10(2)(b) which refers to the claimant's residing in the  UK
      in accordance with these regulations for at least the year immediately
      before the death of his sponsor.


  42. I have had regard to the nature of residence required for the  purpose
      of acquiring the right to reside in the UK set out in other paragraphs
      under the 2006 Regulations. Thus, the wording of  Regulation  10(2)(b)
      making it a requirement that "... he resided in the UK... for at least
      the year immediately before the death of the qualified person"  is  to
      be contrasted with the requirement under other paragraphs of the  2006
      Regulations  which  require  continuous  residence  for  the  relevant
      period.


  43. Regulation 5(3)(b)(i), which relates to  a  worker  or  self  employed
      person who has ceased activity, provides that the  relevant  condition
      is satisfied if he has resided in  the  UK  "continuously".  The  word
      "continuously" is also used in Regulation 5(4)(b).


  44. Regulation 15 sets out the requirements to be met by persons  applying
      for permanent residence.  Accordingly, under  Regulation  15(1)(a)  an
      EEA national who has resided  in  the  UK  in  accordance  with  these
      Regulations for a continuous period of  five years' shall acquire such
      right. Regulation 15(1)(e)(iii) affords such right to the  person  who
      was the family member of a worker or self employed person, where  such
      worker or self employed person had resided continuously in the UK  for
      at least the two years immediately before his death.


  45. Regulation 15(1(f)(i) refers to a  person  who  has  resided  here  in
      accordance with these regulations for "a continuous period"[1].


  46. The First-tier Tribunal Judge considered whether the claimant met  the
      criteria of a family member who has retained the right  of  residence.
      The relevant period was between April 2014 and  April  2015.  In  that
      respect he considered the claimant's evidence that he has resided with
      his partner in the UK between 2009 and 2015.


Unlike  other  Regulations  which  require  that  the  residence   must   be
'continuous' for  the  relevant  period,  it  is  not  a  requirement  under
Regulation 10(2)(b) that he be in continuous residence in  the  UK  for  the
year immediately before the death  of  his  sponsor.  As  construed  in  its
context the term resides refers  to  the  place  where  he  is  normally  or
ordinarily resident.  The requirement is that he must have  resided  in  the
UK for the relevant period.  The evidence before the Judge was that  the  UK
was the country that they adopted as part of  the  regular  order  of  their
life. They had been normally or ordinarily resident in  the  UK  apart  from
temporary or occasional absences of short duration - Shah  v  Barnet  London
Borough Council  [1983] 2 AC 309.


  47. The evidence disclosed that the UK is the place where the claimant has
      his home and to where he and his sponsor returned after a short break.
      There is moreover the reference by the Judge at [10] to the fact  that
      his sponsor acted as his surety at the bail hearing. The  Judge  found
      at [10] that they had been together in the UK between April  2014  and
      July 2014 as well as between November  2014  until  March  2015.   The
      Judge's assessment that his absence from the UK for a short period did
      not affect the year long residence required under the Regulations, was
      a finding to which he was entitled to come.


  48. The Judge also  set  out  in  detail  the  evidence  relating  to  the
      sponsor's self employment. She had been self employed and  trading  as
      Cleaning Services since 10 July 2009. He also found  on  the  evidence
      that on returning to the UK,  she  resumed  self  employment  from  21
      November 2014. That is confirmed in the accountant's letter  dated  12
      December 2014. The  accountants  also  confirmed  that  she  is  self-
      employed and trading as Cleaning Services, which she  had  been  doing
      since 10 July 2009. She was employed at the time the claimant returned
      to the UK. The Judge accordingly accepted that a  break  from  the  UK
      would not necessarily mean that she is not  exercising  Treaty  rights
      having regard to the history of her self- employment as  well  as  the
      employment that she has [8].


  49. During her evidence in support of the claimant's bail application, she
      confirmed that at the time of her return from Poland,  she  was  on  a
      short term visit to see family friends and receiving treatment for her
      eyesight in Poland - claimant's witness statement,  paragraph  10.  In
      the last week of March 2015, she went to Poland again for a follow  up
      appointment for her eye treatment and to visit her family.


  50. The conclusion by the Judge that  the  claimant  qualified  under  the
      Regulations as a family member who has retained the right of residence
      under Regulation 10(2) of the 2006 Regulations is sustainable  on  the
      evidence.


      Notice of Decision

      Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Mailer     7 March 2016

-----------------------

[1]    The authors in McDonald's Immigration Law and Practice, 9th  Edition,
4.15, note that for residence n  the  UK  to  be  considered  continuous,  a
person should not be absent from the UK for more than six months each  year.
Accordingly, even situations where continuous  residence  is  a  requirement
under the particular regulation, an absence of six  months  each  year  will
not necessarily destroy this continuity.
