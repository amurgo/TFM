Representation
For the appellants: Ms J Heybrook instructed by Kothala & Co (for NA), Mr  E
Nicholson  instructed  by  Hammonds  LLP  (for  CO),  Miss   L   Cole-Wilson
instructed by Suriya & Co (for MM)
For the respondent: Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer

   i. The new-style Immigration Rules governing Tier  1  (Post  Study  Work)
      contain a Maintenance (Funds)  requirement  in  mandatory  terms  that
      admit of no discretion and make no allowance  for  sickness  or  other
      mitigating circumstances.

  ii. The effect of para 245Z (e), read together  with  Appendix  C  of  the
      Immigration Rules and closely related parts  of  the  Policy  Guidance
      dealing with Tier 1 (Post-Study) Work, is that, to  qualify,  an  (in-
      country) applicant must show he or she held �800 or over for each  and
      every day of the period of three months immediately preceding the date
      of application.

 iii. This requirement, however, is relaxed for those who applied  before  1
      November 2008. Under transitional provisions they were  only  required
      to provide a bank statement showing a closing balance of �800 or  over
      bearing a date anywhere within the period  of  one  month  immediately
      preceding the date of application.

  iv. The requisite amount of �800 or over can be shown in  the  form  of  a
      personal or joint account and may be shown in  the  form  of  personal
      savings held in overseas accounts.

   v. Because the relevant provisions require applicants to show  that  they
      had the requisite amount of �800 during a three-month period  of  time
      immediately before their application, it  is  not  possible  to  apply
      s.85(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 so  as  to
      enable them to succeed on appeal by proving  they  had  the  requisite
      funds for a period of time (wholly or partly) subsequent to  the  date
      of application.

  vi. However, until s.85A of the 2002 Act is brought into force (subsection
      85(4)(a) of which stipulates that in respect  of  appeals  in   Points
      Based System cases the Tribunal may consider evidence adduced  by  the
      appellant only if it was  submitted  at  the  time  of  applying),  it
      remains possible for appellants to satisfy the  requirements  of  para
      245Z(e) by providing on appeal evidence in specified form showing that
      they had �800 or over in personal savings  for  the  period  of  three
      months immediately prior to the date of application.



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. This determination is a reconsideration of the  cases  of  three  persons
each of whom  had brought an appeal against a  decision  by  the  respondent
refusing to grant  further leave to remain  under  the  Tier  1  (Post-Study
Work) scheme as contained in paras 245V, 245Z and 245ZA of the Statement  of
Changes in the Immigration Rules HC 395 as amended. With  the  agreement  of
the parties all three were heard together. Their appeals  all  turn  on  the
issue of whether each was able to meet  the  requirement  set  out  in  para
245Z(e) that they had sufficient funds as specified in  Appendix  C  to  the
Rules, entitled "Maintenance (funds)". In all three appeals  the  appellants
had met all other requirements of the  Immigration  Rules,  those  concerned
with "Attributes" (Table 9 in Appendix A) and "English  Language"  (Appendix
B) in particular.

2.  Even  though  only  raising,  therefore,  a  limited  number  of  issues
affecting the Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) scheme, the relative novelty  of  the
scheme, and indeed of the entire Points-Based System which  now  forms  part
of the Rules, calls for a brief resume.

3. The Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) scheme forms  part  of  a  new  Points-Based
System (PBS) consisting of five "tiers". At the launch of the new system  in
2006 the Home Secretary said the PBS would revolutionise the  way  in  which
migration into the UK would work (A Points-Based  System:  Making  Migration
Work for Britain  (CM  6741)).   In  a  statement  of  intent  published  in
December 2007, the new system was described as the biggest shake up  of  the
immigration system in its history (Highly Skilled migrants under the  points
system: Statement of Intent, BIA, Dec/07; see Macdonald's Immigration Law  &
Practice, First Supplement to  Seventh  Edition,  2009,  10.6).  Tier  1  is
described by the UKBA  as  being  for  highly  skilled  individuals  seeking
employment or to set up in business; Tier 2 replaces the work permit  scheme
and most of the other categories of Part 5 of the Immigration Rules, with  a
system whereby employers in areas where there are  gaps  in  the  UK  labour
force can apply for sponsorship licences; Tier 3, which is not yet in  force
(and according to  D.Jackson  et  al,  Immigration  Law  and  Practice,  4th
edition, 2008, ch.10 "may never be implemented") is  for  unskilled  workers
to fill specific labour shortages; Tier 4,  in force  since  31  March  2009
(by HC 314),  is  for  students;  and  Tier  5  caters  for  youth  mobility
(replacing  the  previous  provision  for  working  holidaymakers)  and  for
temporary workers, i.e. those coming to the UK  primarily  for  non-economic
objectives. The Points Based System is seen as  integral  to  achieving  the
goal of "Managed Migration".

4. Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) is one of four Tier 1 subcategories, the  others
being "general" (the replacement for HSMP), "entrepreneur"  and  "investor".
It represents a new avenue for further  stay  for  students  from  overseas.
Under the Rules relating to students their entry and stay depends  on  their
continuing to be students and  only  working  with  the  permission  of  the
Secretary of State and for no more than 20 hours a  week.  In  general  they
are not permitted to  switch  from  student  status  to  any  employment  or
business category, albeit (prior to 31 March 2009  when  Tier  4  came  into
operation)  limited  exceptions  were  made  under  the  Training  and  Work
Experience Scheme (TWES) scheme  and  the  Home  Office  was  prepared  very
occasionally to grant such persons leave as a  work  permit  holder  outside
the Rules. In any event, the basis of the new Tier 2 scheme, like  the  work
permit scheme it replaced, is to enable employers based in the UK to  employ
people in certain limited circumstances; it does not confer a right  for  an
applicant to look for work without having a licence to work for  a  specific
employer in a specific approved employment. Under  the  Tier  1  (Post-Study
Work) scheme, however, although it  is  intended  to  provide  a  bridge  to
highly skilled or skilled work, it is  possible  for  successful  applicants
who have been students to stay on for two years and find any work  of  their
choice. As the current Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) of the Points  Based  System
-  Policy  Guidance  (hereafter  "Policy  Guidance")  states,  "[p]ost-study
workers are free to look for work without having a sponsor  for  the  length
of  their  leave".  They  are   also   able   to   work   as   self-employed
businesspeople. The Policy Guidance  and  related  UKBA  statements  on  the
scheme present it as primarily intended to allow the UK "to retain the  most
able international graduates who have studied in the United  Kingdom."  That
reflects the fact that it is a replacement for  the  International  Graduate
Scheme (IGS) (and its predecessor Science and Engineering  Graduates  Scheme
(SEGS) and the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland  Scheme  (FT:WISS).  It  is
stated that although the scheme is only issued for two years, it does  allow
transfer to  a  different  visa  for  skilled  migrants  within  Tier  1  or
alternatively Tier 2 if they are able to secure a sponsor.   Yet  its  terms
currently enable  in-country  applicants  at  least  to  meet  the  academic
requirements, purely on the strength of having obtained a degree in  the  UK
in the 12 months prior to the application (up until 31 March  2009  a  post-
graduate diploma could suffice). We are concerned  in  this  reconsideration
with three appellants who made in-country applications, but the scheme  also
allows for applications for entry clearance, albeit with some  modifications
in the relevant requirements, one being that �2,800, not �800  is  specified
as the required level of funds.

5. Apart from reflecting changes  in  government  policy  towards  different
immigration/migration  categories,  the  PBS,  modelled   loosely   on   the
Australian  system,  also  embodies  certain  features  identified  in   the
government's ongoing "Simplification Project", which seeks to  simplify  not
only  primary  legislation  and  subordinate  legislation   but   also   the
Immigration Rules and  policy  instructions.  Its  aims  include  maximising
transparency, efficiency, clarity  and  predictability,  plain  English  and
public confidence; and minimising,  inter  alia,  "the  need  for  decision-
makers to exercise discretion"  (Simplifying  Immigration  Law:  An  Initial
Consultation, June 2007).  Deciding applications  by  reference  to  whether
applicants  can  score  sufficient  points  if   they   possess   stipulated
attributes relating  to  age,  educational  and  linguistic  qualifications,
previous  earnings,  etc.  reflects  an  attempt  to  reduce   reliance   on
discretion and  decision-making  dependent  on  subjective  evaluation.  The
shift from mainly qualitative to relatively quantitative  tests  appears  to
do the same. Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) represents, therefore, an  example  of
new-style immigration rules, rules which do not necessarily (to  borrow  the
term used by Sedley LJ in GOO [2008] EWCA Civ 747) have a settled  "acquis".
(Whether, however, they have  achieved  simplification  -  when  there  have
already been five versions in less than a year of lengthy Policy Guidance  -
is another matter.)

6. Before going any further it is necessary to set out the legal  framework,
dealing first with  the  Immigration  Rules  and  related  Policy  Guidance,
secondly with provisions governing evidence on appeal and  thirdly  relevant
case law.

The Legal Framework


The Immigration Rules: substantive requirements

7. Paragraphs 245V-245ZA of the Statement  of  Changes  in  the  Immigration
Rules (as amended) set out provisions relating to the  Tier  1  (Post  Study
Work) scheme. These rules, inserted on 9 June 2008, came into  force  on  30
June 2008. Para 245V identifies the purpose of the provisions:

    "245V. Purpose

    The purpose of this route is to encourage international  graduates  who
    have studied in the UK to stay on and  do  skilled  or  highly  skilled
    work."
8.  Paras  245W,  245X  and  245Y  deal  with  entry  and  entry   clearance
requirements. Paras 245Z and 245ZA,  dealing  with  students  applying  from
within the UK for leave to remain  and  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the
grant, state:

    "245Z. Requirements for leave to remain

    To qualify for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Post-Study  Work)  Migrant,
    an applicant must  meet  the  requirements  listed  below.  Subject  to
    paragraph 245ZA (i), if the applicant meets these  requirements,  leave
    to remain will be  granted.  If  the  applicant  does  not  meet  these
    requirements, the application will be refused.
    Requirements:
    (a) The applicant must not fall for refusal under the  general  grounds
    for refusal, and must not be an illegal entrant.
    (b) The applicant must not previously have been granted entry clearance
    or leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) migrant.
    (c) The applicant must have a minimum of 75 points under paragraphs  51
    to 58 of Appendix A.
    (d) The applicant must have a minimum of 10 points under  paragraphs  1
    to 3 of Appendix B.
    (e) The applicant must have a minimum of 10 points under  paragraphs  1
    to 2 of Appendix C.
    (f)  The  applicant  must  have,  or  have  last  been  granted,  entry
    clearance, leave to enter or leave to remain:
         (i) as a Participant in  the  Fresh  Talent:  Working  in  Scotland
         Scheme,
         (ii) as a Participant in the International Graduates Scheme (or its
         predecessor, the Science and Engineering Graduates Scheme),
         (iii) as a Student, provided the applicant has not previously  been
         granted leave in any of the categories referred  to  in  paragraphs
         (i) and (ii) above,
         (iv) as a Student Nurse, provided the applicant has not  previously
         been granted  leave  in  any  of  the  categories  referred  to  in
         paragraphs (i) and (ii) above,
         (v) as a Student Re-Sitting an Examination, provided the  applicant
         has not previously been granted leave  in  any  of  the  categories
         referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above,
         (vi) as a Student Writing Up a Thesis, provided the  applicant  has
         not previously been granted leave as a Tier 1 Migrant or in any  of
         the categories referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above, or
         (vii)  as  a  Tier  4  Migrant,  provided  the  applicant  has  not
         previously been granted leave as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant
         or in any of the categories referred to in paragraphs (i) and  (ii)
         above.
    (g) An applicant who has, or was last granted leave as a Participant in
    the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland Scheme must be a British National
    (Overseas), British  overseas  territories  citizen,  British  Overseas
    citizen, British protected person or a British subject  as  defined  in
    the British Nationality Act 1981.
    (h) If:
         (i) the studies  that  led  to  the  qualification  for  which  the
         applicant obtains points under paragraphs 51 to 58  of  Appendix  A
         were sponsored by a Government or international scholarship agency,
         and
         (ii) those studies came to  an  end  12  months  ago  or  less  the
         applicant must provide the unconditional  written  consent  of  the
         sponsoring Government or agency to the application and must provide
         the specified documents to show that this requirement has been met.

    245ZA. Period and conditions of grant

    (a) Leave to remain will be granted:
    (i) for a period of the difference between 2 years and  the  period  of
    the last grant of entry clearance, leave to  enter  or  remain,  to  an
    applicant who has or was last granted leave as  a  Participant  in  the
    Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland  Scheme,  as  a  Participant  in  the
    International Graduates Scheme (or  its  predecessor  the  Science  and
    Engineering Graduates Scheme). If this calculation results in no  grant
    of leave then leave to remain is to be refused;
    (ii) for a period of 2 years, to any other applicant.
    (b) Leave to remain under this route will be subject to  the  following
    conditions:
    (i) no access to public funds,
    (ii) registration with the police, if this is required by paragraph 326
    of these Rules, and
    (iii) no Employment as a Doctor in Training unless the  applicant  has,
    or has last been granted, entry clearance, leave to enter or remain  as
    a  Participant  in  the  International   Graduates   Scheme   (or   its
    predecessor, the Science and Engineering  Graduates  Scheme)  or  as  a
    Participant in the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland Scheme."
The Immigration Rules: documentary evidence and application forms

9. In  addition,  the  Immigration  Rules  contain  provisions  relating  to
documentary evidence and applications forms. Dealing with the  former,  para
245AA states:

    "245AA. Documentary evidence

    (a) Where Part 6A or Appendices A to C, or E of these Rules state  that
    specified documents must be provided, that means documents specified by
    the Secretary of State in the Points Based System  Policy  Guidance  as
    being specified documents for the route under which  the  applicant  is
    applying. If the specified documents are not  provided,  the  applicant
    will not meet the requirement for which  the  specified  documents  are
    required as evidence.
    (b) If the Entry Clearance Officer or Secretary of State has reasonable
    cause to  doubt  the  genuineness  of  any  document  submitted  by  an
    applicant which is, or which purports to be, a specified document under
    Part 6A or Appendices A to C, or E of  these  Rules  and  having  taken
    reasonable steps to verify the document, is unable to verify that it is
    genuine, the document will be  discounted  for  the  purposes  of  this
    application."
10.  The  inclusion  of  a  specific  requirement  relating  to  documentary
evidence  makes  it  necessary  to  set  out  a  related  provision  of  the
Immigration Rules dealing with specified forms and procedures for all  kinds
of immigration applications: paras 34-34A-J.  Paragraphs 34A-J replaced,  it
should be noted, the Immigration (Leave to  Remain)  (Prescribed  Forms  and
Procedures) Regulations 2007 (S.I. 2007/No.882) with effect from 2  February
2008 (s. 31A of the 1971 Act having on that date being repealed  by  section
50(3)(a) of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006  which  enables
new and revised application forms to be specified  administratively).  These
repealed Regulations had provided, inter alia,  that  a  failure  to  comply
with  any  of  the  requirements  relating  to  forms  only  invalidated  an
application if several events occurred, including  that   the  Secretary  of
State notified the applicant of the failure within 28 days of  the  date  on
which the application was made. That is now changed.

11. Paras 34-34A-J in their relevant parts provide:

    "Specified  forms  and  procedures  for  applications  or   claims   in
    connection with immigration

    34. An application form is specified when:
         (i) it is posted on the website of the United Kingdom Border Agency
         of the Home Office,
         (ii) it is marked on the form that it is a specified form  for  the
         purpose of the immigration rules,
         (iii) it comes into force on the date specified on the form  and/or
         in any accompanying announcement.
    34A. Where an application form is specified, the application  or  claim
    must also comply with the following requirements:
         (i) the application or claim must be made using the specified form,
         (ii) any specified fee in connection with the application or  claim
         must be paid  in  accordance  with  the  method  specified  in  the
         application form, separate payment  form  and/or  related  guidance
         notes, as applicable,
         (iii) any section of the form which is designated as  mandatory  in
         the  application  form  and/or  related  guidance  notes  must   be
         completed as specified,
         (iv) if the application form and/or related guidance notes  require
         the applicant to provide biographical information, such information
         must be provided as specified,
         (v) an appointment for the purposes  stated  in  subparagraph  (iv)
         must be made and must take place by  the  dates  specified  in  any
         subsequent notification by the Secretary of State following receipt
         of the application, or as agreed by the Secretary of State,
         (vi) where the application or claim is made by post or courier,  or
         submitted in person:
             (a) the application  or  claim  must  be  accompanied  by  the
             photographs  and  documents  specified  as  mandatory  in  the
             application form and/or related guidance notes,
             (ab) those photographs must be in the same format specified as
             mandatory in the  application  form  and/or  related  guidance
             notes, and
             (b) the form must  be  signed  by  the  applicant,  and  where
             applicable, the applicant's spouse,  civil  partner,  same-sex
             partner or unmarried partner, save that where the applicant is
             under the age of eighteen, the  form  may  be  signed  by  the
             parent or legal guardian of the applicant on his behalf,
         (vii) where the application or claim is made online:
             (a) the photographs and documents specified as mandatory  must
             be submitted in the manner directed in  the  application  form
             and/or related online guidance notes and by such  date  as  is
             specified in the acknowledgement of the online application,
             (ab) those photographs must be in the same format specified as
             mandatory in the  application  form  and/or  related  guidance
             notes, and
             (b) the confirmation box (which states  that  the  information
             contained in the application form is true and  complete)  must
             be completed by the applicant or, if the form is completed  by
             an immigration adviser  on  the  applicant's  behalf,  by  the
             immigration  adviser  on  specific   instructions   from   the
             applicant that the information given is true and complete, and
         (viii) the application or claim must  be  delivered  in  accordance
         with paragraph 34B.
    34B. [deals with the rules governing the sending of application forms]
    34C. Where an application or claim in connection with  immigration  for
    which an application  form  is  specified  does  not  comply  with  the
    requirements in paragraph  34A,  such  application  or  claim  will  be
    invalid and will not be considered.
    34D.Where the main applicant wishes to include applications  or  claims
    by any members of his family as his dependants on his  own  application
    form, the applications or  claims  of  the  dependants  must  meet  the
    following requirements  or  they  will  be  invalid  and  will  not  be
    considered:
         (i) the application form must expressly permit the applications  or
         claims of dependants to be included, and
         (ii) such dependants must be the spouse, civil  partner,  unmarried
         or same-sex partner and/or children under the age of 18 of the main
         applicant.

Appendix C
12. We have seen that para 245Z contains requirements that  refer  to  three
appendices: para 245Z(c) requires an applicant  to  have  a  minimum  of  75
points under paras 51 to 58 of Appendix A (dealing  with  attributes),  para
245Z(d) requires an applicant to have a minimum of 10 points under  paras  1
to 3 of Appendix B (dealing with English language).  Para  245Z(e)  requires
an applicant to have a minimum of 10 points under paras 1 to 2  of  Appendix
C (dealing with maintenance).
13. Appendix C of the Immigration Rules,  headed  "C   Maintenance  (Funds)"
states at paras 1A-2:
    "1A. In all cases where an applicant is required to obtain points under
    Appendix C, the applicant must have the funds specified in the relevant
    part of Appendix C at the date of the application and  must  also  have
    had those funds for a period of time set out in the guidance specifying
    the specified documents for that purpose.

    Tier 1 Migrants

    1. An applicant applying for entry clearance or leave to  remain  as  a
    Tier 1 Migrant (other than as a Tier 1 (Investor) Migrant)  must  score
    10 points for funds.
    2. 10 points will only be awarded if an applicant:
             (a) applying for entry clearance, has the level of funds shown
             in the table below and provides the specified documents, or
|Level of funds                                    |Points                  |
|�2,800                                            |10                      |



             (b) applying for leave to remain, has the level of funds shown
             in the table below and provides the specified documents.
|Level of funds                                    |Points                  |
|�800                                              |10                      |


    3. The applicant must have the funds specified in paragraph 2 above  at
    the date of the application  and must also have had those funds  for  a
    period of time  set  out  in  the  guidance  specifying  the  specified
    documents for the purposes of paragraph 2 above."


Policy Guidance


14. The "guidance" referred to in Appendix C (and also, as we shall see,  in
para 245AA) is a reference to the UKBA Policy Guidance  document  identified
earlier, a published document entitled "Tier  1  (Post-Study  Work)  of  the
Points-Based System  -  Policy  Guidance.  This  Policy  Guidance  has  gone
through different versions. The first version of this  guidance  was  issued
when the scheme began on 30 June 2008 (version 06/08). The  second  version,
issued on 11 September 2008 (version 09/08), made  changes  to  the  section
entitled "Tier 1 (Post-study Work): Maintenance" and included a page at  the
end in different typeface headed "Transitional arrangements for  maintenance
(funds)". Further versions were  published  on  27  November  2008  (version
11/08), 19 January 2009 (version 01/09) and 31 March 2009  (version  03/09).
The  guidance  in  all  its   versions   differentiates   between   "initial
applicants" and those who apply having previously had leave to remain  under
the IGS or the FT:WISS. Throughout this determination we are concerned  with
initial applicants unless otherwise stated. It  is  of  some  importance  to
note that as a result of the contents of  the  11  September  2008  version,
there  were  transitional  provisions  regarding  maintenance  relating   to
applicants who applied on  or  before  31  October  2008.  There  were  also
different transitional provisions for  applicants  who  had  previous  leave
under the IGS (formerly  SEGS)  or  the  FT:WISS.  We  shall  look  at  them
shortly.

Those applying after 31 October 2008

15. For those  who  applied  after  31  October  2008  date  the  provisions
contained in the Policy  Guidance  relating  to  funds  are  clear.  In  the
current version of the Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Policy Guidance,  under  the
head "General Guidance for Applicants to the Points-Based  System"  and  the
sub-head "Documents we require to support  applications  under  the  points-
based system", it is stated at paras 10 and 11 that:

    "10. The applicant must ensure he/she provides  all  of  the  necessary
    supporting documents at the time he/she sends us  the  application.  If
    the immigration rules state that specified documents must be  provided,
    we will say  so  in  this  guidance  and  we  will  only  accept  those
    documents.


    11. If the applicant does not provide the specified documents, we  will
    not contact him/her to ask for them. Therefore, if the applicant  fails
    to send the correct documents we may refuse the application."

16.  In  the  specific  section  headed  "Maintenance  requirement   -   all
applications" the Policy Guidance states:

    "89. One of the requirements of Tier 1 is that an applicant  coming  to
    the UK must be able to support himself/herself for the entire  duration
    of his/her stay in  the  UK  without  use  of  public  funds  (benefits
    provided  by  the  state).  An  applicant  who  is  unable  to  support
    himself/herself could face financial hardship because he/she  will  not
    have access to most state benefits.


    90. In order to qualify for entry clearance, or leave to  remain  under
    Tier 1 an applicant must show that he/she has enough money  to  support
    himself/herself. The maintenance requirements are detailed below:


            . Applicants outside the UK seeking entry clearance  must  have
              at least �2,800 of personal savings which must have been held
              for at least three months prior to the date of application.


            . Applicants in the UK seeking further  leave  to  remain  must
              have at least �800 of personal savings which must  have  been
              held  for  at  least  three  months  prior  to  the  date  of
              application.
    91...


    92...


    93. The evidence to support personal savings for at least three  months
    must be original, on the official letter-headed paper or stationery  of
    the organisation and have the office stamp  of  that  organisation.  It
    must have been issued by an authorised official of that organisation.


    94.  Evidence must be in the form of  cash  funds.  Other  accounts  or
    financial instruments   such  as  shares,  bonds,  pension  funds  etc,
    regardless of notice period are not acceptable.


    95. The evidence of maintenance must be of cash funds in the bank (this
    includes savings accounts and current accounts even when notice must be
    given), loan or official financial or government sponsorship  available
    to the applicant. Other  accounts  of  financial  instruments  such  as
    shares, bonds, pensions etc., regardless  of  notice  period,  are  not
    acceptable.


    96.  Only  the  following  specified  documents  will  be  accepted  as
    evidence of this requirement:


             (i) Personal bank or building society statements  covering  the
                 three consecutive months.


             The most recent statement must be dated no more than one
             calendar month before the date of application.


               The personal bank  or  building  society  statements  should
           clearly show:
              . The applicant's name;
              . The account number;
              . The date of the statement;
              . The financial institution's name and logo;
              . Transactions covering the three month period;
              . That there are enough funds  present  in  the  account  (the
                balance  must  always  be  at  least  �2,800  or  �800,   as
                appropriate).


             Ad hoc bank statements printed on  the  bank's  letterhead  are
             admissible as evidence (this excludes min-statements from  cash
             points).
             ... [sets out guidance on electronic bank statements]
             We will not accept statements which show  the  balance  in  the
             account on a particular day as these documents do not show that
             the applicant holds enough funds for the full period needed."


17. The Guidance then gives three alternative types of  specified  documents
acceptable as evidence of maintenance (funds) and sets out the  requirements
for each which closely  mirror  those  for  personal  bank  statements:  ii)
Building society pass book covering the previous three months period;  (iii)
Letter from bank confirming funds and that they have been in  the  bank  for
at least  three  months;  and  (iv)  Letter  from  a  financial  institution
regulated by Financial Services Authority (FSA) or, in the case of  overseas
accounts, the home regulator (official regulatory body for  the  country  in
which the institution operates and the funds are located) confirming funds.

Those applying before 1 November 2008: transitional arrangements

18. For all applicants who  applied  before  1  November  2008,  the  Policy
Guidance was in similar terms, although there were minor variations and  the
paragraph  numbering  was  different.  However,  in  the  version  dated  11
September 2008 two important additions were made at the  beginning  and  end
of the document. At the beginning, headed "Addendum", it was stated:

    "Tier 1(Post-Study Work) of the points-based system Policy Guidance.


        This document contains guidance [sic] to our policy on Tier 1 (Post-
        Study Work) of the points  based  system  to  work  in  the  United
        Kingdom.


        Maintenance  (funds)  requirement:  We   have   made   transitional
        arrangements for proving maintenance  (funds)  for  applicants  and
        their family members who make applications up to and  including  31
        October 2008. You can find details of these on  the  last  page  of
        this document."

19. Giving these details, the last page contains the following statement:

    "Transitional arrangements for maintenance (funds)


    Normally, when applying to Tier 1 (Post-Study  Work)  from  within  the
    United Kingdom, you will have to show that you have  enough  funds,  by
    sending documentation showing you have had savings of at least �800 for
    at least three months before applying.


    Because this is a new requirement and it may be difficult to prove this
    immediately,  we  have  put  transitional  arrangements  in  place  for
    applicants and  their  family  members  submitting  their  applications
    within the United Kingdom up to and including 31 October 2008.


    Up to 31 October 2008, you do not have to show you have had  the  funds
    for at least three months before your application. You must  only  show
    you have the required funds  at  the  time  you  apply.  The  types  of
    documentary evidence you need to send to support your  application  are
    as described in this document. However, until 31 October 2008, they  do
    not need to cover the three-month period, but they  must  be  dated  no
    more than a month before your application.


    For example, if you apply under Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) on 12 July,  a
    single bank statement with a closing balance of �800 dated  between  12
    June and 12 July 2008 will meet the maintenance  requirements.  A  bank
    statement dated before 12 June 2008 will not be acceptable."

   20. This is clearly a transitional arrangement affecting  all  applicants
   applying before a specified date.


   Transitional arrangements for those with current leave in the  IGS,  SEGS
   (Science and Engineering Graduates Scheme)  and  FT:WISS  (Fresh  Talent:
   Working in Scotland Scheme).


   21. There are also different  transitional  arrangements  affecting  some
   categories of applicants only. As  already  noted,  since  inception  the
   Policy Guidance has differentiated between "initial" applicants and those
   with current  leave  in  the  IGS,  SEGS  or  FT:WISS  categories.  Since
   inception it has contained a separate section headed  "Tier  1(Post-Study
   Work)  -Points   Scoring:   Points   scoring   assessment   -transitional
   arrangements".  This  section  deals   with   transitional   arrangements
   affecting Appendix A (Attributes) and Appendix B (English  Language).  It
   makes no reference to any transitional arrangements affecting Appendix  C
   (Maintenance). However, since the third appellant in this case falls into
   the IGS category, it is appropriate that we note what these  arrangements
   specify. In the subsection dealing with  "Attributes"   para  84  of  the
   current version (31 March  2009)  explains  that  any  applicant  who  is
   currently in the UK under the IGS, SEGS or FT:WISS categories (which have
   now been deleted from  the  Immigration  Rules)  "may  apply   under  the
   transitional arrangements to come  into  the  Tier  1  (Post-Study  Work)
   category, as described below". Paras 85 and 86 then state:


    "85. With the implementation of Tier 1  (Post-Study  Work),  applicants
    who were granted less than 2 years leave under the [IGS] or the  [SEGS]
    will be able to apply to Tier 1 under  the  transitional  arrangements.
    These arrangements will enable them to obtain a total of up to 2  years
    leave under of combination of their previous scheme and Tier  1  (Post-
    Study Work).


    86. Participants in the [FT:WISS] will normally  have  been  granted  2
    years leave at the outset and therefore most of them will not need  any
    transitional arrangements. However, an applicant who was  granted  less
    than 2 years leave under the [FT:WISS} can apply under the transitional
    arrangements in Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) to get  a  total  of  2  years
    leave under a combination of their previous scheme and  Tier  1  (Post-
    Study Work).


22. Earlier at para 82 there is a Table setting out the  requirements  under
these transitional arrangements for the award of  points  for  Tier  1(Post-
Study Work). Under this 75 points are available for applicants applying  for
leave to remain who have, or were last granted, leave as  a  participant  in
the IGS, SEGS or FT:WISS categories.


23. Under a separate section head entitled  "English  language  assessment",
immediately after a paragraph dealing with initial applications  (para  87),
there is a paragraph dealing with  "Transitional  arrangements"  (para  88).
The latter states:


    "88. If the applicant currently has, or was last  granted  leave  as  a
    participant in  the  [IGS]  (or  its  predecessor,  the  [SEGS])  or  a
    participant in the [FT:WISS] he/she will satisfy the  English  language
    requirement."


Evidence on appeal


24. To complete the legal framework, we also need to set out the  provisions
of s.85(4) and s.85(5) of the 2002 Act. They provide:


    "85. Matters to be considered


    ...


    (4) On an appeal under  sections  82(1),  83(2)  or  83A(2)  against  a
    decision the Tribunal may consider evidence about any matter  which  it
    thinks relevant to the substance of the  decision,  including  evidence
    which concerns a matter arising after the date of the decision.


    (5) But in relation to an appeal under section 82(1) against refusal of
    entry clearance or  refusal  of  a  certificate  of  entitlement  under
    section 10-


       (a) subsection (4) shall not apply, and


      (b) the Tribunal may consider only the circumstances appertaining  at
    the time of the decision to refuse."


25. We need also to set out the new section 85A introduced by  s.19  of  the
UK Borders Act 2007, albeit not yet in force.  It states:

    "Points-based applications: no new evidence on appeal
    (1) For section 85(5) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002 (c.41) (appeal: new evidence may be considered: exception)
    substitute-

    "(5) But subsection (4) is subject to the exceptions in section 85A."

    (2) After section 85 of that Act insert-

    "85A Matters to be considered: new evidence: exceptions
    (1) This section sets out the exceptions mentioned in section 85(5).

    (2) Exception 1 is that in relation to an appeal under section 82(1)
    against an immigration decision of a kind specified in section 82(2)(b)
    or (c) the Tribunal may consider only the circumstances appertaining at
    the time of the decision.

    (3) Exception 2 applies to an appeal under section 82(1) if-

    (a) the appeal is against an immigration decision of a kind specified
    in section 82(2)(a)[refusal of leave to enter the UK]  or (d)[refusal
    to vary a person's leave to enter or remain in the UK if the result of
    the refusal is that the person has no leave to enter or remain],

    (b) the immigration decision concerned an application of a kind
    identified in immigration rules as requiring to be considered under a
    "Points Based System", and

    (c) the appeal relies wholly or partly on grounds specified in section
    84(1)(a), (e) or (f).

    (4) Where Exception 2 applies the Tribunal may consider evidence
    adduced by the appellant only if it-

    (a) was submitted in support of, and at the time of making, the
    application to which the immigration decision related,

    (b) relates to the appeal in so far as it relies on grounds other than
    those specified in subsection (3)(c),

    (c) is adduced to prove that a document is genuine or valid, or

    (d) is adduced in connection with the Secretary of State's reliance on
    a discretion under immigration rules, or compliance with a requirement
    of immigration rules, to refuse an application on grounds not related
    to the acquisition of "points" under the "Points Based System"."

    (3) In section 106(2) of that Act after paragraph (u) insert-

    "(ua) may make provision, for the purposes of section 85A(4)(a), about
    the circumstances in which evidence is to be treated, or not treated,
    as submitted in support of, and at the time of making, an
    application;".


26. It can be seen that s.85A does not replace s.85(4).  Rather  it  expands
the scope of the s. 85(5) exceptions to it, in respect of new evidence.  One
component  of  "Exception  2"  relates  expressly  to  appeals  against   an
immigration decision  concerning  an  application  under  the  Points  Based
System.


Relevant cases


27. Mention should also be made of the two Tribunal decisions to which  each
of the representatives made reference: LS  (Gambia)  and  EA  (Nigeria),  as
well as the Court of Appeal case of GOO. Since EA was concerned  to  clarify
the meaning of LS (Gambia) we can confine ourselves to a summary of  EA.  EA
concerned a student who between the date of application for leave to  remain
and the date of decision (and without the respondent  learning  of  it)  had
changed his course from a  degree  course  in  accountancy  and  finance  at
London Metropolitan University to a Bachelor of Science degree  in  computer
science at Anfell College. At paras 5-7 the Tribunal stated:

   "5....Section 85(5) provides, by way of contrast, that an appeal  against
   entry clearance or a certificate of entitlement (that is to say, an  out-
   of-country appeal) is  to  be  decided  by  reference  only  to  evidence
   relating to the circumstances  at  the  date  of  the  decision.  As  the
   Tribunal pointed  out  in  LS  (Gambia)  s85  (4)  applies,  without  any
   difference of wording, to asylum and human rights appeals and  in-country
   immigration appeals. It follows  that,  under  the  2002  Act,  they  are
   governed by the same principles so far as the admissibility  of  evidence
   is concerned: that is what s85 (4) is about.
   6. But the evidence is only admissible in so far as the  Tribunal  thinks
   it "relevant to the substance of the decision". That phrase is important.
   It is not the evidence's  relevance  to  the  appellant's  claim  or  his
   application that is in question: it is its relevance to the decision that
   was actually made. It may be the case  that,  as  has  been  suggested  a
   number of times in the Court of Appeal, the issue of whether a person  is
   a refugee at any particular time  is  "one  composite  question";  but  a
   decision on a matter under the Immigration Rules is  a  decision  on  the
   detailed eligibility of an individual  by  reference  to  the  particular
   requirements of the Rule in question in the context  of  the  application
   that that person has made.
   7. It is thus not open to an appellant to argue simply that, on the  date
   of the hearing, he meets the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules.  He
   can succeed only if he shows that the decision  that  was  made  was  one
   which was not in accordance with the  Immigration  Rules.  Section  85(4)
   allows him to show that by reference to evidence  of  matters  postdating
   the decision itself, and it may well be  that  the  effect  is  that  the
   question for the Tribunal in an in-country case is whether  the  decision
   can be justified as a correct one at the date of the  hearing.  But  that
   does not mean that  the  Tribunal  is  the  primary  decision-maker.  The
   Tribunal's  task  remains  that  of  hearing  appeals  against  decisions
   actually made. The correct interpretation of  s85  (4)  is  perhaps  best
   indicated by saying that the appellant cannot succeed by showing that  he
   would be granted leave if he made an  application  on  the  date  of  the
   hearing: he can succeed only by showing that he would be granted leave if
   he made, on the date of the hearing, the same application as  that  which
   resulted in the decision under appeal. The subsection does not permit  an
   appellant to change his  case  under  the  Immigration  Rules  for  being
   allowed to remain in the United Kingdom. (That  is,  of  course,  without
   prejudice to the fact that s84 (1) may allow the  appeal  to  succeed  on
   different grounds entirely.) "
28. In GOO the Court of Appeal was concerned  with  eight  cases  where  the
Secretary of State had found persons to fail to  meet  the  requirements  of
the Immigration Rules relating to students either because they  had  changed
their course since applying for variation of leave or had failed to  produce
evidence of satisfactory attendance or progress. At  paras 29- 31 Sedley  LJ
noted that  whilst it was always open to the  Secretary  of  State  to  deal
with anomalies and difficulties in the application of the Immigration  Rules
by exercising  discretion  outside  the  rules  (and  sometimes  inside  the
rules), there was a second way which was more rational,  particularly  given
that the relevant  immigration  rules,  para  60(v)  in  particular,  lacked
clarity and  did not contain explicit words laying down that no  regard  was
to be had to considerations such as illness:
   "29. A second way of dealing with such anomalies is to  ask  whether  the
   rules really are so stringent that the anomalies have to  arise  at  all.
   The appellants' case is that there is no need to read rule 60(v) with the
   stringency of SW (Jamaica); that doing so is productive of injustice; and
   that a more generous reading can do much to prevent this. In  support  of
   his approach Mr Macdonald reminds us of the decision of Woolf  J,  as  he
   then was, in R v IAT, ex parte Gerami [1981] Imm AR 187:
       "...it would not be right to treat a  person  as  disqualified  from
       being given further leave to remain in this  country  because  of  a
       prolonged lack of success. That is  a  matter  which  only  goes  to
       discretion under  para  12  and  does  not  amount  to  a  condition
       precedent to a successful application."
    30. While, as Mr Macdonald acknowledges, the rules are no longer in the
    form they were in then, Gerami in his  submission  forms  part  of  the
    acquis of law and practice relating to foreign  students  -  an  acquis
    which appears to have remained undisturbed until and for a decade after
    the introduction of HC 395 in 1995 and only  recently  to  have  become
    contentious. Whether this is right or not, the approach of Woolf  J  in
    Gerami seems to us to make so much sense that it would take clear words
    to displace it; and we consider that rule 60(v) is by no means clear in
    this regard. Of course the Home Secretary needs to know how  a  student
    has done in his examinations in order to decide whether  he  is  making
    satisfactory progress and should be allowed to stay on.  But  it  would
    take very explicit words to lay down that a student  who  has  attended
    every lecture and seminar and turned in excellent  coursework  has  not
    made  satisfactory  progress  because  he  was  too  ill  to  sit   his
    examinations, and that he is therefore debarred for  good  from  having
    another shot at them. We do not believe that Parliament,  in  approving
    the Immigration Rules pursuant to s.3(2) of  the  1971  Act,  can  have
    thought that it was sanctioning in such circumstances  the  termination
    of a prospective career in which a foreign student had  invested  years
    of his life and possibly all his family's savings; nor  that  the  Home
    Secretary, if called upon to explain them, would have  said  that  this
    was their intended effect.
       Conclusion of law
    31. In our judgment the meaning of rule 60(v) is  that  a  student  who
    wants an extension  of  stay  must  be  able  to  produce  evidence  of
    satisfactory progress, whether on the course named in  his  application
    for entry clearance or on another recognised course which he or she has
    undertaken. A failure to sit or  to  pass  relevant  examinations  will
    always be material to the evaluation of  the  student's  progress,  but
    whether it is decisive will depend on the reason for it. If the  reason
    is  not  inconsistent  with  satisfactory  progress,  rule   60(v)   is
    satisfied."
The Appellants

29. All three appellants had applied for further leave to remain  under  the
new Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) scheme. The first appellant, a citizen  of  Sri
Lanka, who had  studied  here  and  been  awarded  a  BSc  degree  from  the
University of Portsmouth, applied on 19 November 2008. He scored  sufficient
points to qualify under the "Attributes"  and  "English"  requirements,  but
fell down on "Maintenance". He  had  submitted  statements  of  his  current
account with HSBC for the 3 month period 14 August to 14 November 2008,  but
the account did not show a  credit  balance  continuously  over  �800  until
after 1 October 2008. For that reason the respondent, on 18  December  2008,
refused his application. On appeal, however, Senior Immigration Judge  (SIJ)
McKee allowed his appeal. In a determination notified on  11  February  2009
he found that although prior to the date of application the appellant  could
only show one-and-a-half months  during  which  his  personal  savings  were
always �800 or more, by the time of the hearing he was able to show that  he
had  an  unbroken  period  of  three  months  during  which  he  had   funds
consistently above the �800 level. On that basis, the  SIJ  considered  that
s.85(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (hereafter  "the
2002 Act") entitled him  to  treat  the  recent  period  as  satisfying  the
requirements of the Rules in substance.  The respondent  was  successful  in
obtaining an order for reconsideration.

30. The second appellant, a citizen of Jamaica,  had  recently  completed  a
full-time Masters degree in Actuarial Science at  City  University,  London.
Shortly afterwards, on 29 October 2008, she  applied  for  an  extension  of
leave to remain under  Tier  1  (Post-Study  Work).   She  enclosed  a  bank
statement dated "September 2008" covering the  period  10  September  to  25
September 2008 showing that throughout that period  she  had  a  balance  of
over �800. Due to transitional provisions then in place,  she  was  informed
she was only required to  show  a  closing  balance  of  at  least  �800  in
personal savings. In a decision dated 11 December  the  respondent  accepted
she had the requisite number of points under Appendices A and B but  awarded
no  points  under  Appendix  C  ("Maintenance  (funds)").  Accordingly   the
Secretary of  State  refused  her  application  stating  that  she  was  not
satisfied the appellant had provided the specified  documents  to  show  she
was in possession of sufficient funds, as detailed  in  Appendix  C  of  the
Immigration Rules. Her appeal came before  Immigration  Judge  (IJ)  R  B  L
Prior. By the time of the hearing the appellant had submitted  further  bank
statements covering  the  period  29  September  -  29  October  2008;  they
included statements showing a closing  balance  of  over  �800  within  this
latter period. In a determination notified on 9 February 2009  he  dismissed
her appeal. Despite stating at para 2 that "I can  only  take  into  account
the circumstances appertaining at the time  of  the  hearing  before  me  by
virtue of Section 85(4) of  the  2002  Act",  he  made  no  mention  of  the
evidence she had submitted just before the hearing. He  found  that  as  the
respondent had required her to produce a personal  bank  statement  covering
the one-month period immediately before the application  showing  a  minimum
balance of �800, her production of a bank statement covering the  period  10
September-25 September amounted  to  a  failure  to  produce  the  specified
documents. He then stated:

    "9. By the date of the decision of 11 December 2008  the  specification
    of the period to be covered by a bank or building society statement had
    been enlarged from one month to a period of  three  months  immediately
    preceding the application.


    10. Clearly the intention of the Rules is that  applicants  prove  that
    they are relatively financially self sufficient. Such  sufficiency  was
    not likely to be satisfied by evidence that on a single day  a  sum  of
    �800 was available to the applicant, but that credit balance fell  away
    and thus was not maintained as  a  minimum  and  continuing  source  of
    adequate financial assistance.


     11. I was not satisfied that the Appellant met the requirements of sub-
    paragraphs 245Z (e) of the Rules, as at the date of either the decision
    or the hearing".


31. The appellant sought and  obtained  an  order  for  reconsideration,  it
being found arguable that the IJ had misunderstood  the  relevance  of  s.85
(4) of the 2002 Act.

32. The third appellant, a citizen of Tanzania, had  been  pursuing  studies
in the UK since September 1998. On 11 July  2007  she  was  granted  further
leave to remain as a participant of the  IGS  until  9  July  2008.   On  30
November 2007 she was awarded a diploma in higher education. On 7 July  2008
she applied  for  leave  to  remain  under  Tier  1(Post-Study  Work)  as  a
participant of the International  Graduate  Scheme  (IGS).   The  respondent
refused her application under Appendix C stating that the documents she  had
provided did not demonstrate that she had been in  possession  of  �800  for
the period specified in the guidance. She had produced bank  statements  for
the period 12 April 2008 to 11  June  2008.  These  showed  that  over  this
period she was continually overdrawn usually by at least �500.  On  11  June
2008 these showed an overdraft of �559.88. She  appealed  stating  that  her
understanding was that she was required to demonstrate that she  had  earned
�800 per month, rather than that she had �800 in her bank account. She  also
stated that she had been ill from December 2007 to  February  2008  and  had
not recommenced her employment with BUPA  Care  Homes,  Ilford  until  March
2008, having been supported during her period of illness by  her  uncle.  On
19 August 2008 Immigration Judge Ross dismissed her appeal.  He  noted  that
the appellant had conceded:

     "that she did not have �800 at the date of  the  application,  or  one
    month before it. In fact no bank statement had been  submitted  showing
    the accounts of 7 July 2008. The  nearest  date  is  approximately  one
    month earlier on 11 June 2008 when she was over �500  overdrawn.  Sadly
    for her therefore she does not meet the requirements of the Immigration
    Rules, the fact that she was ill a few months earlier is not  a  matter
    which I can take into  account,  and  neither  is  the  fact  that  she
    misunderstood the rules."

33.  He went on to dismiss her appeal on Article  8  grounds  as  well.  Her
application for reconsideration argued that the IJ  had  failed  to  address
the Court of Appeal case of GOO and in doing so had caused injustice to  the
appellant. On statutory review David Holgate QC sitting  as  a  Deputy  High
Court Judge ordered reconsideration. He stated that  whilst  Article  8  was
unarguable, he considered that albeit GOO was dealing with a different  part
of the Immigration Rules it was arguable that the rationale of the  decision
was applicable to the "interpretation  and/or  application  of  both  [para]
245(e) and Appendix C [of the Immigration Rules]. On that basis it could  be
relevant to take into account evidence on the Appellant's  illness  as  well
as the history of the Appellant's studies in the UK."

Submissions

The first appellant
34. Mr  Tufan's  submission  concerning  the  respondent's  application  for
reconsideration in respect  of  the  first  appellant  was  as  follows.  He
accepted that if it was right  for  the  three  months'  requirement  to  be
considered by reference to the date of hearing,  then  the  first  appellant
met it. However, he submitted, it would be wrong to consider  it  thus.  The
wording of para 245Z(e) and 245AA  and  the  interconnected  Appendices  and
Policy Guidance documents admitted of no discretion and made clear that  the
relevant date for deciding whether an applicant met the maintenance  (funds)
requirement was the date of application, not the date of  decision  or  date
of hearing. Para 245AA specifically prevented applicants producing  evidence
post-application. The Policy Guidance made clear that  for  each  and  every
day  of  the  three  months  period  that  applied  to  this  appellant  the
applicant's personal savings had  "always" to be �800 or more.  In  assuming
that he could consider the requirement satisfied by reference to funds  held
by the first appellant for a further one and half months after the  date  of
application (so as to give him 3 months in total) SIJ McKee went beyond  his
remit. The reference in s.85(4) to "the substance of the  decision"  related
in this type of case to what the applicant had by  way  of  savings  at  the
date of application and it made no sense  to  consider  that  s.85(4)  could
come to the aid of the first appellant.

35. Miss Heybrooke contended that SIJ McKee was right to  treat  s.85(4)  as
entitling him to consider evidence of  funds  post-dating  the  application,
since the Immigration Rules were subordinate to  legislation  and  both  the
Rules and the Policy Guidance were simply guidance and had to  give  way  to
primary legislation which allowed post-decision evidence to  be  taken  into
account.  To read the Immigration Rules and Policy Guidance literally  could
lead to all kinds  of  injustices  and  absurdities,  e.g.  leading  to  the
failure of an appellant whose savings fell under �800 during  the  requisite
period for just one day. It could mean accepting that someone  who  had  the
requisite savings at the date of application but had none  by  the  time  of
hearing could  still  succeed  under  the  Immigration  Rules,  even  though
plainly no longer able to maintain  himself  or  herself.    SIJ  McKee  was
correct to note, she said, that the amendment to s.85 (4)  created  by  s.19
of the UK Borders Act 2007, viz. s.85A, was not yet in force. Without  s.85A
there was no statutory basis for excluding post-decision  evidence  relevant
to the  substance  of  a  decision.  In  addition,  reported  cases  of  the
Tribunal,  LS   (Post-decision   evidence-Directions-Appealability)   Gambia
[2005] UKAIT 00085 and EA (Section 85 (4) explained)  Nigeria  [2007]  UKAIT
00013 in particular, made clear that  on  appeal  immigration  judges  could
have regard to evidence indicating that an appellant  met  the  requirements
at the date of hearing. Unlike  the  appellant  in  EA  whose  switch  to  a
different course after the date of application meant her appeal failed,  the
first appellant was not seeking to change his application from what  it  had
been originally: his application remained the same throughout.  The  purpose
of the Immigration Rules was surely achieved by the IJ deciding  the  appeal
on the basis of evidence as it stood at the date of the hearing.  By  taking
the latest evidence into account he avoided injustice. He ensured  that  the
assessment was proportionate, balancing  strict  requirements  against  GOO-
type considerations  calling  for  flexibility.  To  take  account  of  such
evidence also fitted well with a purposive approach to construction  of  the
Immigration Rules, since the purpose was to ensure students wanting to  work
under this scheme had some support whilst here.  If the first appellant  had
made his application three months earlier, he would only have  had  to  show
�800 for one month. It was also pertinent that the new Rules  had  not  been
well-publicised and the transitional period was a very short one (30 June  -
31 October 2008). The period  indicated  by  SIJ  McKee  covered  the  three
months between 3 November 2008 and 6 February 2009, the  latter  being  just
three days before the hearing, meaning that it was as  up-to-date  as  could
be expected.

The second appellant
36. In giving his reasons for dismissing the second appellant's  appeal  the
IJ had emphasised that since the appellant had  applied  under  this  scheme
her credit balance had fallen away so that it was  less  than  specified  as
necessary both at the date of the decision  and  the  date  of  hearing.  In
amplifying the second appellant's grounds for reconsideration  Mr  Nicholson
submitted that thereby the IJ had clearly misunderstood the purport of  s.85
(4). He had written that "I can only take  into  account  the  circumstances
appertaining at the time of the hearing  before  me  by  virtue  of  Section
85(4) of the 2002 Act",  ignoring  that  this  provision  governed  evidence
relating to the date of decision. At the date of application, he  submitted,
the second appellant met the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  Because
she had applied on 29 October 2008, i.e. before 31 October  2008,  she  fell
under the transitional provisions. Those provisions were not entirely  clear
but on either of  two  main  possible  constructions  the  second  appellant
succeeded. If those provisions only required her to show  she  had  �800  on
(what could be as little as) one day during  the  month  directly  preceding
her application she plainly succeeded, e.g. on 25  September  2008  she  had
�1,641.87 in personal savings. If that  provision  meant  she  had  to  show
personal savings at �800 or above for  a  continuous  period  of  one  month
directly preceding her application, then in fairness the  respondent  should
have had regard to her August bank statements  because  the  bank  statement
month for September did not cover the whole of that  month  and  she  should
not be disadvantaged by the different time-cycles of banks or by when  banks
chose to send out monthly statements. They were  the  only  bank  statements
she could get at the time.

37. Mr Nicholson also had a fallback argument in case we were not  with  him
in respect of what the second appellant had been able  to  evidence  at  the
date of application. It was that the second appellant was able to  meet  the
one-month requirement of showing �800 or  more  during  the  period  of  one
month immediately before the date of application by virtue of evidence  that
was submitted post-decision but in time for the hearing  before  the  IJ   -
evidence showing she had personal savings always on or  above  �800  between
27 September 2008 and 29 October 2008.

38. We asked Mr  Nicholson  what  relevance  he  thought  para  34A  of  the
Immigration Rules had to his fall-back position that  the  second  appellant
could pray in aid evidence as to  her  personal  savings  in  the  one-month
period directly preceding her application, albeit  such  evidence  was  only
submitted for the first time shortly  before  the  IJ  heard  her  case.  He
contended that this provision could not negate the clear terms of  s.85  (4)
which entitled an  IJ  to  consider  post-decision  evidence.  It  was  also
significant that the Policy Guidance itself  made  clear  that  applications
that failed to include all the specified documents could still  be  accepted
as valid. Para 12 of the current Policy Guidance, for example,  stated  that
if the applicant did not provide  the  specified  documents,  "we  will  not
contact him/her to ask for them".  But  it  continued:  "Therefore,  if  the
applicant  fails  to  send  the  correct  documents  we   may   refuse   the
application" (emphasis added). That made clear, he said, that there  was  no
automatic invalidation. In  a  further  note  submitted  shortly  after  the
hearing Mr Nicholson submitted that para 34A was a rule about invalidity  of
applications and non-compliance with it had the result that the  application
would not be considered. In the  second  appellant's  case  the  appellant's
application had not been treated as invalid and so the  respondent  must  be
taken as having "waived" the requirements of this rule. In  any  event,  his
note added,  it  was  not  open  to  the  respondent  had  not  refused  the
application for Post-Study Work due to the second appellant failing to  meet
para 34A requirements (We should add that during their  submissions  neither
of the other two representatives chose to make  comments  on  the  para  34A
point; Mr Tufan's submission, which we shall examine later at para  63,  was
expressly tentative).

39. Section 86(3), said Mr Nicholson, obliged the IJ to allow the appeal  if
the decision against which the appellate was brought was "not in  accordance
with the law  (including  immigration  rules)...".  The  IJ's  approach,  if
accepted, would compel immigration judges to fulfil the role  of  a  primary
decision-maker.

40.  Mr Tufan agreed with Mr Nicholson that the IJ's approach to s.85(4)  as
set out in para  2  (and  para  11)  of  his  determination  was  wrong  but
contended that the effect of para 245AA was  that  unless  the  evidence  of
funds at an �800 level was provided at the time of applying, that was  that:
it made no difference if it was provided  later.   He  further  disputed  Mr
Nicholson's view that the appellant in fact met the requirements  under  the
transitional provisions set out in the relevant Policy  Guidance.  Mr  Tufan
said he accepted that the transitional provisions in respect of  maintenance
were ambiguous. If the requirement set out in that guidance meant  that  she
had to show she always had �800 for a one month period prior to the date  of
application, then the fact of the matter was that  she  had  only  submitted
relevant bank statements covering the period 10-25 September, which did  not
cover the one month period immediately before the application (which was  30
September - 29 October) and in any event was less  than  a  calendar  month.
The statements she had submitted for August were even  further  outside  the
requisite period. Even if  the  transitional  provisions  only  required  an
applicant to show �800 in savings for  one  day  in  the  month  immediately
preceding the application, the second  appellant  still  failed  to  qualify
since she had no closing balance of �800  during  the  relevant  period.  So
whilst he accepted that the IJ had erred in law, his  error  should  not  be
seen as material since at para 8 the  IJ  had  correctly  decided  that  the
(September)  statement  she  had  produced  covered  less  than  one   month
immediately before the application. That reason was sufficient  on  its  own
to justify the IJ's dismissal of the appeal in law. For the same reasons  he
had given in his submissions on the  first  appellant's  case,  he  did  not
accept that the second appellant could show  she  met  the  requirements  of
para 245Z(e) on the strength of evidence submitted only recently.

The third appellant
41. Miss Cole-Wilson for the  third  appellant  confirmed  that  her  client
accepted that neither at the date of application, the date of  decision  nor
the date of hearing did she have the funds  specified  in  Appendix  C  read
together with the Policy Guidance. However,  shortly  before  the  adjourned
first-stage reconsideration hearing she had reached  a  position  where  she
was able to  show  she  had  requisite  funds:  she  had  submitted  a  bank
statement covering 2 February-18 February 2009 showing  a  balance  of  over
�1,000.  On LS (Gambia) and EA (Nigeria)  principles  she  was  entitled  to
have her case decided on the basis of the evidence available at the date  of
hearing of her appeal. In the period before her application,  she  had  been
off sick between 6 December  2008  and  23  March  2009;  she  had  survived
through the third-party support of her uncle  as  she  was  entitled  to  do
under the Immigration Rules on students.   Miss  Cole-Wilson  accepted  that
the  appellant  could  not  rely  on  having  misunderstood  the  rules  but
submitted that the IJ was wrong to find at para  11  that  her  illness  was
"not a matter which I can take into account...".   She  contended  that,  as
recognised by the  Deputy  High  Court  judge  who  granted  the  order  for
reconsideration on statutory  review,  the  case  of  GOO  was  relevant  by
analogy. Notwithstanding her status under the Immigration  Rules  the  third
appellant's initial entry was as a student and at the  time  of  application
her status as a student was still subsisting. Section 86(3) required  an  IJ
to allow an appeal not  only  where  it  was  not  in  accordance  with  the
Immigration  Rules  but  also  when  it  was  not  in  accordance  with  the
immigration law. As with the case of LS (one of the appellants in GOO),  her
illness amounted to what Sedley LJ described at para 25 as:

    "the not uncommon situation in which genuine personal difficulties have
    either prevented a student from sitting a course examination or  caused
    him to fail it. The present cases, to the facts of  which  we  will  be
    coming, afford reminders of the kinds of vicissitude  that  can  impede
    studies."

42. Para 245Z embodied a provision which was in the circumstances unfair  in
that it made no provision for a situation where somebody is  prevented  from
satisfying the requirements of  the  rules  by  circumstances  beyond  their
control.  As emphasised in GOO, Parliament must be taken to have  understood
that persons who come to the UK as students make  a  considerable  financial
and personal investment and a strict liability approach was contrary to  the
spirit of the Immigration Acts. The third appellant had a  good  immigration
history and prior to the new code coming into effect had been here  lawfully
for just over 10 years. The purpose of the Immigration Rules was  to  ensure
that  a  person  had  been  financially  able  to  manage  prior  to   their
application. Whilst the appellant was in hospital and recuperating  she  had
been put in funds by her uncle (third-party support was permitted under  the
student Rules) and since back at work it inevitably took  time  for  her  to
build up her own savings again.

43. Mr Tufan in reply contended that the relevant rules were  not  flexible;
they reflected  an  intention  of  Parliament  to  codify  rules  that  were
transparent, streamlined and predictable.  GOO  was  not  concerned  with  a
maintenance requirement. In any event para 60 (with reference  to  para  57)
dealt  with  terms  such  as  "satisfactory  attendance"  and  "satisfactory
progress" which were capable of the  broad  interpretation  given  by  their
lordships, in preference to the more literal approach which had  been  taken
by the Tribunal up to that time. The third  appellant  may  have  been  here
lawfully for some time but she had always until now asserted  that  she  was
going to leave the UK at the end of here studies, which was some  10  months
before the present application.

Discussion
44. It can be seen that paras 254AA-ZA cross-refer to  three  appendices  to
the Rules, A-C. Appendix A deals  with  "Attributes",  and  specifies  which
academic qualifications qualify an applicant to score points and  how  many.
Appendix  B  deals  with  "English  Language"  and  sets  out,  inter  alia,
organizations and tests on  a  list  of  English  language  test  providers.
Appendix C, headed  "Maintenance  (Funds)"  sets  out  the  requirements  an
applicant must meet in order to score the requisite 10  points  awarded  for
this sub-category. Both para 245AA and Appendix C refer expressly  to  there
being "guidance" existing about their requirements (which can  only  be  the
Policy Guidance on Tier 1(Post Study) Work). Appendix C  directs the  reader
to this guidance  for determining two things: the period of time  for  which
an applicant has to have  had  the  requisite  funds  (�800  for  in-country
applications) and what are the specified  documents  required  in  order  to
show that: Appendix C says that these matters are "set out"  in  the  Policy
Guidance "for that purpose".

45. Several observations are in order.

46. First, the provisions as  just  set  out  consist  of  three  components
(provisions in para 245, in  Appendices  A-C  and  in  a  document  entitled
"Policy Guidance") that are closely interrelated. Para 245Z cross-refers  to
Appendix C and para 245AA and Appendix C cross-refer to the Policy  Guidance
(as we shall see later on, para 34A also contains a  reference  to  "related
guidance notes"). Plainly, like Appendix  A  and  B,  Appendix  C  forms  an
integral part of the Immigration Rules. Whilst the Policy Guidance  as  such
is not part of  the  Immigration  Rules,  the  Rules  do  refer  to  it  (as
"guidance") and it is guidance which specifies what documentary evidence  is
acceptable. It is not a rule  which  leaves  the  requirements  relating  to
acceptable evidence to be discovered by reference to what the  Secretary  of
State may require (as is the case with the  requirement  contained  in  para
289 of the Immigration Rules relating to domestic  violence  for  applicants
to produce "such evidence as may be required by the Secretary of  State",  a
rule whose status was analysed in Ahmed Iram Ishtiaq v SSHD [2007] EWCA  Civ
386, paras 31-34). And there are two respects in which the rules  treat  the
guidance as determinative: as to the period of time for which  an  applicant
must show he has had the requisite �800 in maintenance  (funds)  and  as  to
the type of documents he must produce to evidence that.  Unlike  some  items
of Home Office policy, the Policy Guidance does not seek or purport  to  set
out, and is not to be confused with a  document  setting  out,   matters  of
Home Office policy that exist as concessions outside the rules. Unlike  UKBA
Immigration Directorate Instructions  (IDIs)  which  albeit  in  the  public
realm are written for UKBA staff, the Policy  Guidance  is  clearly  written
for potential applicants. As such it is something on  which  applicants  are
entitled to  rely  as  accurate  and  reliable  information  about  what  is
expected of them if they wish to qualify under the  Immigration  Rules.  The
Policy Guidance appears, therefore, to be a hybrid  of  a  new  kind,  being
guidance expressly for applicants and containing some  provisions  that  are
integral to the understanding and  operation  of  the  relevant  immigration
rules.

47. Second, the requirements set out in paras 245Z and  in  Appendix  C  are
expressed  in  mandatory  language:  to  qualify  for  leave  to  remain  an
applicant "must" meet the listed requirements. In particular, para 245Z  (e)
specifies that the applicant "must" have a minimum of 10 points under  paras
1 to 2 of Appendix C. Para 1A of Appendix C specifies that "[i]n all  cases"
the applicant "must" have the funds specified and  "must"  score  10  points
for funds. These requirements admit of no discretion. The guidance given  in
the Policy Guidance is for the  most  part  in  similar  terms.  Unlike  the
typical maintenance requirement  still  found  in  many  categories  of  the
Immigration Rules, that in para 245Z(e) requires  applicants  to  show  they
have the maintenance money in the form of a specified  amount  held  over  a
specified past period.

48. Third, there is an  absence  in  these  provisions  of  any  tests  that
require the decision-maker to  make  up  his  or  her  own  mind  about  the
appellant's  academic  or  linguistic  attributes  by  reference   to   past
circumstances  or  performance.  There  is   no   longer   any   maintenance
requirement of a kind that requires the decision maker to make  a  judgement
about whether it is "adequate". If,  by  reference  to  specified  lists  or
exceptions, applicants can show that the  requisite  academic  qualification
has been awarded to them, that they have the necessary language  requirement
and a specified amount  of  funds  (and  assuming  no  general  grounds  for
refusal apply), they must be granted leave to remain for two years (less  in
IGS, SEGS or FT:WISS cases: see para 245ZA(a)(i)).  We shall have  cause  to
return to this observation later on when dealing with the  submissions  made
on behalf of the third appellant, who sought to rely on the Court of  Appeal
case of GOO.

 49. It would be wrong  to  say  that  the  Points  Based  System  generally
represents the  ascendancy  of  "box-ticking"  or  that  it  has  completely
eliminated the  need  for  the  exercise  of  individual  judgement  by  the
decision-maker, particularly in respect of  the  relevant  Policy  Guidance.
For example, in relation  to  verification  of  documents  both  the  Policy
Guidance for Tier 1(General) and that for Tier 1(Post Study Work) note  that
where the agency has "reasonable doubts" that a document is genuine  it  may
seek to verify the document with an independent third  party  or  government
agency. And it is stated that what is considered to  be  "reasonable  doubt"
will depend on an individual application.  But  so  far  as  para  245Z  and
Appendices A, B and C are concerned, there are no such  terms  and  even  in
the Policy Guidance, there are relatively few requirements which require  an
exercise of interpretation or individual judgement.

50. Fourth, the provisions relating to  Tier  1  (Post-Study  Work)  do  not
contain any allowances for persons who find themselves unable  to  meet  the
requirements specified in Appendices A-C by virtue  of  illness  or  related
circumstances outside the control of an applicant. There are  none  in  para
245Z(e) or Appendix C and none in the Policy Guidance. That is  not  to  say
that the Tier 1 scheme as a whole is wholly free  of  such  allowances.  For
example under the separate Tier 1(General) of  the  Points  Based  System  -
Policy Guidance, in the section dealing with  "Attributes"  and  calculation
of points deriving from previous earnings, para 67 states:

    "Points for previous earnings can be claimed in respect of any  single,
    consecutive 12 month period from the 15 months immediately prior to the
    date of application. The only  circumstances  where  an  applicant  may
    claim points for a 12 month period of earnings  from  outside  of  this
    period are where:


    the applicant can  establish  that  they  have  been  absent  from  the
    workplace at some point during the last 12  months,  due  to  full-time
    study (initial applications only);


    or


    the applicant can  establish  that  they  have  been  absent  from  the
    workplace at some point during the last 12 months  (or  during  the  12
    months preceding the start of full-time studies) due  to  a  period  of
    maternity or adoption related leave" (the  latter  are  dealt  with  at
    paras 80-85).


51. Fifth, the relevant Immigration Rules contain specific requirements  for
documentary evidence, which, again, are described in mandatory  terms,  para
245AA stipulating that where Appendix A to C,  or  E  state  that  specified
documents must be provided:

    "that means documents specified by the Secretary of State in the Points
    Based System Policy Guidance as being specified documents for the route
    under which the applicant is applying. If the specified  documents  are
    not provided, the applicant will not meet the requirement for which the
    specified documents are required as evidence".

52. Here again there is an example of an immigration  rule  that  defers  to
the Policy Guidance for defining a particular requirement, namely  what  are
the "documents specified".

53. In the light of these general  observations  we  turn  to  set  out  our
findings on the key issues raised by these appeals.

The mandatory nature of the Tier 1 (Post-Study) Work requirements

54. In view of the mandatory formulation of the requirements for the Tier  1
(Post-Study Work) scheme as given by the Immigration Rules we see  no  scope
for adopting a purposive construction. It is well-established  that  such  a
construction cannot be  applied  where  the  words  are  wholly  unambiguous
(Alexander v Immigration Appeal Tribunal) [1982] 2 All ER  766.  Subject  to
what we say below about the transitional  provisions  (and  also  two  other
aspects of the Policy Guidance:  see  paras  71,  72-78),  their  plain  and
ordinary meaning is absolutely clear. The use of "must"  means  that  either
the requirements are met or they are not met. In ex parte Rahman [1987]  Imm
AR 313, the Court of Appeal stated that although a  degree  of  latitude  is
allowed  in  construing  the  Immigration  Rules,  it  does  not  extend  to
departing from the plain, ordinary, natural meaning of the language. In  any
event, even when a purposive construction may be called  for  (e.g.  because
of ambiguity), it is salient to consider what was said by  Laws  LJ  in   MB
(Somalia)  v  Entry  Clearance  Officer  [2008]  EWCA  Civ  102.   Laws   LJ
considered whether the plain and ordinary meaning of a rule  should  be  set
aside or modified in order to give effect to a  purposive  construction.  He
pointed out that any rule should be construed so as to further its  purpose,
but considered that that purpose could usually be identified from the  terms
of the instrument itself. Developing the point further in  AM  (Ethiopia)  &
Others  & Anor v Entry Clearance Officer  [2008]  EWCA  Civ  1082,  Laws  LJ
stated that "[i]t is in the  nature  of  the  Immigration  Rules  that  they
include  no  over-arching  implicit  purposes.  Their  only  purpose  is  to
articulate the  Secretary  of  State's  specific  policies  with  regard  to
immigration  control  from  time  to  time,  as  to  which  there   are   no
presumptions, liberal or restrictive. The whole of their meaning is,  so  to
speak, worn on their sleeve...."

The non-discretionary nature of the requirements

55. We have already highlighted  the  mandatory  wording  of  para  245Z(e),
Appendix C and the relevant parts of the Policy  Guidance.  Additionally  we
have noted that there is no scope in para 245Z, Appendix  C  or  the  Policy
Guidance for allowances to be made for applicants  who  are  unable  through
circumstances beyond their control  to  meet  the  maintenance  requirement.
There is, we saw, such a provision within  the  Policy  Guidance  provisions
governing Tier 1(General) and past earnings (for  maternity  and  adoption),
but there is nothing similar under the Post-Study Work scheme.

56. For this reason we  see  no  merit  in  Miss  Cole-Wilson's  submissions
concerning the relevancy of GOO. As noted earlier, there is  an  absence  in
the Tier 1 (Post-Study Work)  provisions  of  any  tests  that  require  the
decision-maker to make  up  his  or  her  own  mind  about  the  appellant's
abilities or qualifications or the quality of his or  her  past  performance
as a student. These provisions are wholly different in character from  those
found within the Immigration Rules for students  considered  in  GOO.  Terms
like "regular attendance" and "satisfactory progress" are not  tied  to  any
prescribed set of standards. The Immigration Rules laying down  requirements
of this kind for students have a long history and have been  operated  hand-
in-hand with a set of Home Office practices when applying them  to  students
who had fallen ill or were unable to study  for  pressing  reasons.  It  was
this complex context (or "acquis") which led Sedley LJ to  decide  that  the
Tribunal's approach to such criteria for ascertaining ability to  study  had
been too narrow, stringent and literal and had to be rejected in  favour  of
a broader approach which accepted that  attendance  and  progress  could  be
assessed giving due weight to justifiable difficulties that  a  student  may
have experienced. Such a context is entirely lacking under the Tier 1 (Post-
Study Work) scheme (the terms of which may indeed be in part a  response  to
GOO).

57. To the extent that the previous type of  maintenance  requirement  often
used in the Rules - cast in terms of  adequacy  -  was  and  is  capable  of
individual judgement, such a requirement has  not  been  replicated  in  the
context of the Tier 1  scheme.  Maintenance  is  now  defined  in  terms  of
specified funds.

The historic nature of the Appendix C maintenance requirement


58. In order to achieve the 10 points awarded for  maintenance,  Appendix  C
states that applicants must show "[i]n all cases" that they have  the  funds
specified "at the date of the application  and  must  also  have  had  those
funds for a period of time set out in the guidance specifying the  specified
documents  for  that  purpose".  The  language  could  not  be  clearer.  It
stipulates that a decision must be made by reference to  a  fixed  point  in
the past, namely the date of application.  It is an  historic  test  affixed
to that specific date. It is  true  that  para  2(b)  contains  the  present
tense: it states that an applicant can only awarded 10 points if her or  she
"has"  the  level  of  funds  shown.  But  the  words  used   are   "if   an
applicant...applying for  leave  to  remain  has..."  that  level  (emphasis
added) and para 2 is also clearly circumscribed  by  para  3,  which  states
that the applicant "must have the funds specified in para  2  above  at  the
date of the application ...". Put another way, the rule  in  Appendix  C  is
one which does not require the decision-maker to ask "What is  the  position
today (at the date of decision)?", but "What is  shown  about  the  position
over a past period (calculated by reference to the date of applying)?".  The
requirement to "have" the level of funds is met by proving  that  they  were
held at that level over a specified past period.


59. It is in virtue of this feature of the requirement that  we  reject  the
submissions made by Ms Heybrook for the  first  appellant  which  sought  to
argue that he was entitled to succeed by virtue of  s.85(4)  as  interpreted
by the Tribunal in  EA (Nigeria) (itself seeking to clarify  the  effect  of
LS (Gambia)). Of course, EA (Nigeria) has now to be read  in  the  light  of
GOO and the fact that the Court of Appeal did not accept  that  it  mattered
whether students had changed  courses  from  the  ones  nominated  in  their
application, since such changes were considered not  to  alter  the  ongoing
fact that they were applying for (further) leave as  students.  But  in  our
view that modification does not affect the  underlying  principle  expressed
in EA that focus has to be placed on the substance of the  decision.  Indeed
it is this principle that is the  key  to  understanding  why  EA  does  not
assist appellants in respect  of  appeals  concerned  with  the  Appendix  C
requirement. It is true that EA (Nigeria), like LS (Gambia)  identifies  the
fact that s.85(4) has the effect that the  question  of  whether  appellants
meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules may be decided in  the  light
of post-decision evidence. But these cases  were  concerned  with  decisions
that did not specify a fixed historic  timeline.  The  type  of  immigration
decision at issue here is  one  that  concerns  an  application  of  a  kind
identified in immigration rules  as  requiring  to  be  considered  under  a
"Points Based System". Part of  the  substance  of  that  decision  concerns
whether something has been shown to be the case  in  the  past  and  over  a
period of time to be calculated by reference to the date of  application.  A
requirement that a person owned property at a specific point in time in  the
past is not met by showing that he owns it at the present time. EA fails  to
help applicants seeking to rely on funds accrued  since  they  applied,  not
because of anything to do with whether the nature of their  application  has
changed over time: normally applications made by  applicants  for  leave  to
remain under the Post-Study Work scheme  will  not  have  not  changed  into
something else. It fails to help simply because the decision in question  in
this type of case imposes a requirement tied to an historic time.

The relevance of s. 85(4)

60. What are the consequences of this for the  applicability  of  s.  85(4)?
According to Mr Tufan the specific provisions in the Immigration  Rules  and
Policy Guidance governing Tier 1 prevent it from having any application.

61. The principal provision he identified was para 245AA,  although  in  the
light of questions the panel put to Mr Nicholson, he also sought to rely  on
a separate provision of the Rules, namely para 34A.

62. The  effect  of  para  245AA  was,  he  said,  to  specifically  prevent
applicants submitting documentary evidence post-application with a  view  to
showing they did have �800 in personal savings over  the  requisite  period.
However, in our view that is to misread this rule. Para 245AA is not a  rule
requiring that documentary evidence has  to  be  produced  at  the  time  of
application. Rather it is a rule with a two-fold function,  namely:  (i)  to
identify what documents have to be provided ("...documents specified by  the
Secretary of State in the Points  Based  System  Policy  Guidance  as  being
specified documents for the route under which the applicant  is  applying");
and (ii) to clarify the  consequences  of  non-provision  of  the  specified
documents ("If the specified documents are not provided, the applicant  will
not meet the requirements for which the specified documents are required  as
evidence"). The rule does not contain a requirement for  production  of  the
specified  documents  at  any  particular  point  in  time.  It   is   also,
manifestly, not a rule purporting to govern how evidence is to  be  received
on an appeal.

63. The other provision suggested tentatively by  Mr  Tufan  to  render  the
application of s.85(4) to Tier 1 cases nugatory is para 34A. The latter,  of
course, is a provision relating to all kinds of applications  in  connection
with immigration. Paras 34A and 34C have three  main  elements:  first  they
delimit their scope to application forms which are  "specified"  (para  34);
second, they set out the requirements in respect of specified  forms  (34A);
and third, they spell out  the  consequences  of  non-compliance  with  such
requirements (para 34C).  The apparent significance for Tier  1  (Post-Study
Work) lies in what is stated in para 34A(vi). It  obliges  an  applicant  to
comply with the following requirement:

   "(vi) where the application or claim is  made  by  post  or  courier,  or
   submitted in person::


      a) the application or claim must be accompanied by the photographs and
         documents specified as mandatory in  the  application  form  and/or
         related guidance notes..." (emphases added)

64. The relevance of this provision, submits Mr Tufan, is that  the  Tier  1
(Post-Study  Work)  Policy  Guidance  specifies   as   specified   documents
documentary evidence of personal savings  in  certain  forms,  e.g.  in  the
form of a personal bank statements. Hence he says, if an applicant  has  not
ensured that his application is "accompanied" by such documents, there is  a
patent failure to comply with  para 34A.

65. We do not agree with Mr Tufan's analysis. We have rejected the  argument
that  s.85(4) can override a decision under the Points  Based  System  tying
eligibility to the possession of funds for a period in the past. Being  able
to show at the date of hearing that  an  appellant  now  has  the  requisite
level of funds cannot help. But that does not mean the  sub-section  has  no
role whatsoever in such cases.  We have examined its scope  in  relation  to
evidence about matters arising post-decision,  but  it  is  not  only  about
that. The subsection states:

    "...the Tribunal may consider evidence about any matter which it thinks
    relevant to the substance of the  decision,  including  evidence  which
    concerns a matter arising after the  date  of  the  decision."(emphasis
    added).

66. Its wording clearly encompasses  not  just  evidence  which  concerns  a
matter arising after the date of decision but also evidence  arising  before
it.  Thus if there is evidence hitherto unavailable or simply  not  produced
which concerns a matter arising before the date of decision,  s.85(4)  gives
the Tribunal power to take it into account.

67. In principle, therefore, there is nothing  to  stop  the  Tribunal  from
exercising its power under s.85(4)  to  consider  evidence  that  applicants
have submitted post-application to show that they  had  the  requisite  �800
pre-application.

68. We agree that the language of para 34A is  mandatory  and  that  in  the
case of an applicant for Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) who has not submitted  the
specified documentary evidence with the application form (i.e. at  the  same
time as the date of application), then it may be that the  application  does
not meet all the requirements of the Rules. But none  of  the  decisions  in
each  of  these  appeals  was  based  on  para  34C  (which  sets  out   the
consequences of a breach of  para  34A).  Further,  each  of  the  decisions
states that it is a decision made under  para  245Z(e)  of  the  Immigration
Rules.  Each  states  that  because  the  appellant  has  not  provided  the
specified documents to show possession of the requisite level  of  funds  he
or she  cannot be awarded  any  points  under  Appendix  C  (to  which  para
245Z(e) cross-refers). The precise route by which the respondent got to  the
point of deciding their  cases  under  para  245Z(e)  notwithstanding  their
apparent non-compliance with para 34A and  the  apparently  clear  terms  of
para 34C  - whether that be by waiver, as  suggested  by  Mr  Nicholson,  or
some other route - is not a matter we need to  decide.  What  we  are  faced
with is the need to reconsider appeals  against  decisions  made  under  the
Immigration Rules and in our view it is imperative that  we  consider  those
decisions as they stand.

69.  To the extent that Mr Tufan sought to take a position on para  34A,  we
would merely point out that the same IDIs that set out  the  new  procedures
brought in by para 34A relating to specified application forms (IDI  Feb/08)
state at 8.6. "Once discretion has been exercised to accept  an  application
as valid, in line with para 8.3 or 8.5 above, consideration should  continue
as usual in line with the immigration rules or published  policy  applicable
to the application".

70. There is a similar approach to be found in  the  Policy  Guidance.  This
Guidance  clearly  proceeds  on  the  assumption  that  the  respondent  has
discretion as to whether to waive compliance with such requirements.  As  we
have already noted, in the Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Policy  Guidance,  under
the head "General Guidance for Applicants to the  Points-Based  System"  and
the sub-head "Documents we require to support applications under the points-
based system", it is stated at paras 10 and 11 that:

    "10. The applicant must ensure he/she provides  all  of  the  necessary
    supporting documents at the time he/she sends us  the  application.  If
    the immigration rules state that specified documents must be  provided,
    we will say  so  in  this  guidance  and  we  will  only  accept  those
    documents.


    11. If the applicant does not provide the specified documents, we  will
    not contact him/her to ask for them. Therefore, if the applicant  fails
    to send the correct documents we may refuse the  application."[Emphasis
    added]

73. Such provisions somewhat undermine Mr Tufan's attempt to rely  on  other
passages in the Policy Guidance which require   specified  documents  to  be
submitted with the application, in particular the statement at para 10  that
"[t]he  applicant  must  ensure  he/she  provides  all  of   the   necessary
supporting documents at the time he/she sends us the  application."(emphasis
added). As we  have  already  noted,  the  very  next  paragraph,  para  11,
expressly states that the respondent has  a  discretion  as  to  whether  to
treat failure to comply with this requirement  as  an  obstacle:  it  states
that "... if the applicant fails  to  send  the  correct  documents  we  may
refuse the application" (emphasis added).

74. Thus it can be seen that nothing in the Immigration Rules  dealing  with
Points Based applications or in the  Policy  Guidance,  has  the  effect  of
rendering s.85(4)'s  potential  application  to  Tier  1  (Post-Study  Work)
appeals nugatory. If it had been intended that applicants could not  succeed
unless they had submitted the specified documents at the  time  of  applying
that could have been specified; but it was not. The nature of  the  decision
concerned (one whose substance relates in  part  to  an  historic  timeline)
limits the scope of application of this sub-section, but  does  not  exclude
it entirely. Neither the Rules nor the Policy Guidance  stipulates  anything
either about the reception of evidence  on  appeal,  which  (for  in-country
appeals) is governed by s.85(4).

75. It is not surprising that this is  so.  Section  85(4)  is  a  piece  of
primary legislation, whereas the Immigration Rules are not  even,  as  noted
by Lord Hoffman in Odeola v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
[2009] UKHL 25 at para 6, a form of subordinate legislation.  By  virtue  of
s.86(3) they have  the  force  of  law  but  they  cannot  override  primary
legislation. Indeed it seems to us, as it seemed to SIJ McKee  in  the  case
of the first appellant (and Mr Tufan did not seek  to  disagree),  that  the
respondent has clearly recognised the current primacy of s.85(4)  by  having
decided  it  was  necessary  to  enact  further   primary   legislation   to
circumscribe its effect specifically  in  respect  of  Points  Based  System
appeals.  As already noted, s.19 of the UK Borders Act 2007 amends  s.85  of
the 2002 Act so as to create two exceptions to it,  one  of  which  is  that
neither  s.85(4)  nor  s.85(5)  will  apply  to  Points  Based  appeals.  It
introduces a statutory  requirement  in  Points  Based  appeals  prohibiting
consideration by the Tribunal of evidence that  was  not  submitted  at  the
time of making the application. However, it is not yet in force. Until  this
amendment to the 2002 Act comes into  force  the  immigration  rules  cannot
fetter the applicability of s.85(4). They cannot  create  an  exception  not
yet brought into force.


The relevant period of time for showing possession  of  funds:  the  post-31
October 2008 position

76.  We must now spell out what  the  above  means  for  the  issue  of  the
relevant period of time over which an  applicant  must  show  the  requisite
level of funds. Para 1A of Appendix C stipulates that an applicant  "must...
have the funds specified in the relevant part of Appendix C at the  date  of
application and must also have had those funds for a period of time set  out
in the guidance...". Such wording makes plain that the decision  on  whether
an applicant can show the requisite funds is to be made by  reference  to  a
period of time before the  date  of  application  as  given  in  the  Policy
Guidance. The current version of the latter specifies that   the  period  of
time over which in-country applicants must show  they  have  held  at  least
�800 is the  period  of  "at  least  three  months  prior  to  the  date  of
application" (para 90).

77. The formulation given in para 90 does not say expressly that the  period
must  be  at  least  three  months  immediately  prior  to   the   date   of
application", but we do not think anything else can be meant. It would  make
no sense for it to refer to earlier disconnected periods  of  three  months.
So much is conveyed by the subsequent para 96 which  states  that  the  most
recent bank or building society statements must be dated no  more  than  one
calendar  month  before  the  date  of  application  and  must  cover  three
"consecutive" months. Were Appendix C and the specified parts of the  Policy
Guidance to be read as permitting applicants to rely on earlier  unspecified
periods of three months, there would be nothing in principle  to  stop  them
being possibly a very long time ago, even before an applicant had  become  a
student.

78. The only caveat we would make to the above is that  there  would  appear
to be some leeway in respect of the evidence which applicants  must  produce
in order to prove they  have  personal  savings  of  �800  or  more  in  the
preceding three months. Although read literally that appears  to  mean  that
they must show they have this level of  savings  for  the  entirety  of  the
calendar month immediately preceding the application, it is  not  said  that
the proof of that has to be completely up to date; indeed the  reference  in
para 96 to the most recent statement having to be "dated no  more  than  one
calendar month before the date of application" clearly  envisages  that  the
proof need not cover the situation right up to and  including  the  date  of
application.  It is wholly understandable why  this  requirement  cannot  be
meant literally, as it would impose something wholly impractical,  conjuring
up the spectacle of applicants having to perform a same-day dash from  their
banks (to get a statement dated that day)  to  the  post-box  (to  post  the
application form). If an applicant applies in person at 4 p.m. on day X,  it
may be impossible for them to  have  obtained  a  bank  statement  giving  a
closing balance for that same day and it may be impracticable  for  them  to
obtain one within a week or so.

The relevant period of time for showing possession of  funds:  the  position
up to 31 October 2008: transitional provisions: one month or one day?

79.  Of  the  three  appellants  only  the  second  appellant  had  made  an
application before 1 November 2008. From our summary  of  their  submissions
it can be observed that both his representative, Mr Nicholson, and the  Home
Office  Presenting  Officer,  Mr  Tufan  regarded  the  position  under  the
transitional provisions as ambiguous. Very properly  they  made  submissions
covering the two main possible interpretations, namely that applicants  must
show that directly preceding the date of application they held �800 or  more
for either (i) any one day; or (ii) one month. Their uncertainty,  which  we
are aware has been reflected in recent determinations by immigration  judges
on Tier 1 (Post Study Work) cases,  is  understandable  since  the  specific
guidance contained on the last page of the relevant Policy Guidance,  headed
"Transitional arrangements for maintenance (funds)" states  that  applicants
do not need to show they have had  the  funds  for  at  least  three  months
before their application: "You must only show you have  the  required  funds
at the time you apply". That sentence, unhelpfully, does not in terms  state
what period of time is meant by "time you apply".    The next two  sentences
give some clue. They state:

    "The types of documentary evidence you need to  send  to  support  your
    application are as  described  in  this  document.  However,  until  31
    October 2008, they do not need to cover  the  three-month  period,  but
    they must be dated no more than a month before your application".

80. They help clarify that, in order to show you  have  requisite  funds  at
the "time you apply", what you need to show must be dated  no  more  than  a
month before the application. But they say nothing  about  needing  to  show
funds covering the period of a month.

81. However, according to Mr Tufan, the final  paragraph  appears  to  point
towards the period over which an applicant must show �800 or more  as  being
one month. It states:

    "For example, if you apply under Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) on 12 July, a
    single bank statement with a closing balance of �800 dated  between  12
    June and 12 July 2008 will meet the maintenance  requirements.  A  bank
    statement dated before 12 June will not be acceptable."

82.  We note that the example hypothesizes a one month  period  (12  June-12
July) and refers to it being sufficient to produce a single  bank  statement
with a closing balance of �800 "between" those  two  dates.  The  difficulty
with this wording is that the term  "between" is ambiguous.  It  could  mean
"over" or "covering" that period or it could  mean  simply  a  date  falling
within that period. The final sentence  simply  reinforces  the  point  made
earlier that the period within which a bank statement closing  balance  must
be dated cannot go back more than one month before the date of  application.


83. Given the ambiguity, what assistance can  be  gained  from  a  purposive
construction? It might be thought that either  reading  is  consistent  with
the expressed purpose behind this provision, namely to  make  allowance  for
the difficulty of proving a new  requirement  introduced  in  rapid  fashion
without having alerted would-be student applicants.

84. Ultimately, therefore, it comes down to considerations of  transparency.
In our view, given this ambiguity, applicants could  not  be  blamed  if  in
response they had submitted a single bank statement within  that  month  not
necessarily showing funds of �800 or over for all  of  that  month.  If  the
transitional provisions had meant to require applicants to  show  they  held
�800 for a whole month, they would have said so. That being  the  case,  the
wording should  be read as requiring only that an applicant produce  a  bank
statement showing a closing balance of   �800,  the  date  of  that  closing
balance falling on any date within the period of  one  month  prior  to  the
date of application. On that  interpretation  it  is  possible  to  envisage
cases in which the applicant had  only  held  �800  or  over  for  one  day,
although he or she may be able to show that that amount was  held  for  more
than one day.

85. There is still the matter of what is meant by  "closing  balance"?  Does
it mean that what is required is a bank statement showing an end balance  of
�800 or over (meaning the last balance shown on the statement)? Or  does  it
mean a bank statement showing that on at least one day of the daily  entries
recorded there was a daily closing balance of �800 or over? If it  were  the
latter it would not necessarily matter if the end-balance  shown  were  less
than �800. If it were the former it would not matter that, for example,  the
last balance given was the only one on which an applicant  could  show  �800
or over. Normal  usage,  as  we  understand  it,  is  to  construe  "closing
balance" as meaning  the  balance  that  is  carried  forward  to  the  next
statement. "Closing balance" is normally distinguished from  "daily  closing
balance". Since it would be  theoretically  possible  for  an  applicant  to
produce a single bank statement  showing  a  closing  balance  on  any  date
within the previous month, it may  be  that  in  practice  there  is  little
difference between the two possible  interpretations.  For  that  reason  we
think the approach should be to follow normal usage.

The amount of �800: must it be shown on each and  every  day  of  the  three
month period?

86. Except in the form of general calls for a purposive  construction,  none
of the representatives in the three cases before us  sought  to  argue  that
the requirement to show �800 in personal savings over a three  month  period
could be met by applicants whose savings dipped below that  figure  for  one
or more days. In our view such  argument  would  have  been  futile  in  any
event. It is true that neither para 245Z(e) nor Appendix C states  in  terms
that  applicant must show his or her personal savings have  always  been  at
the level of �800 or more over the three months. But by virtue of  the  fact
that they do cross-refer to the Policy Guidance to  establish  the  relevant
period of time and the relevant specified documents, we think that  in  this
specific context it is justified to use the Policy Guidance  as  an  aid  to
interpreting what is mean by an applicant "having had" the "level of  funds"
for the requisite period.

 87. In adopting  this  approach  we  are  conscious  that  in  relation  to
internal Home Office policy instructions and specific  matters  of  guidance
not identified in the Immigration Rules, the position is that they  are  not
to be used as an aid to construction: see ZH (Bangladesh)  [2009]  EWCA  Civ
para 32. However, it seems to us  that  the  express  linkage  made  by  the
Immigration Rules to what the Policy Guidance has to say  about  the  period
of time and documents needed to  evidence  that,  necessitates  a  different
approach.

88. We recognise, focussing  on  the  Policy  Guidance,  that  it  does  not
specify an "always" requirement in every place where it is dealing with  the
funds requirement.  For example, at paras 48(6) and 82, which  set  out  the
requirements for the award of points for initial  applicants,  it  is  noted
that "Applicants for leave to remain in the United Kingdom  must  have  �800
of available funds" (at para 90 the wording is "must have at least  �800  of
personal savings"). But at para 96, which is one of the  provisions  of  the
Policy Guidance specifying what  documents  are  required  to  evidence  the
maintenance requirement, it is stated at subpara 1. that  personal  bank  or
building society statements "should clearly  show"  ...[that]  "the  balance
must always be at least �2,800 or �800, as appropriate."  (emphasis  added).
Earlier on in the same paragraph it is explained that  the  respondent  will
not accept statements which simply show the balance  in  the  account  on  a
particular day "as these documents do not demonstrate that  applicants  hold
sufficient  funds  for  the  full  period  required.".  In  our  view  these
provisions are inextricably linked to what  the  Immigration  Rules  require
and to seek to read them down in some way would be to undermine the Rules.

89. Even if, contrary to what we have found,  a  purposive  construction  of
the  Maintenance  (Funds)  requirement  were  thought  apt,  it  would   not
necessarily follow, in any event, that it would  be  appropriate  to  excuse
any dips below  �800  since  it  is  clearly  seen  as  the  minimum  amount
necessary to ensure self-support (the Policy Guidance refers  to  applicants
showing they have "at least" �800 [�2,800 in out of country  cases];  it  is
not an optimal figure.

  Nature of the applicant's control over the funds

90. Unlike the rules governing businesspersons, applicants under Tier 1  are
permitted to demonstrate they meet the  maintenance  requirement  even  when
their personal savings of �800 or more are held in a joint account.  Nothing
is said about this in the very  first  or  current  version  of  the  Policy
Guidance, but in the second (at para 93), third (at  para  100)  and  fourth
versions (at para 100) (see para 14 above) of the  Policy  Guidance  it  was
expressly stated that if an applicant wishes to rely on a joint  account  as
evidence of available funds, he/she must be named on the account along  with
one or more other named individuals. We think  that  if  the  latest  Policy
Guidance intended to adopt a different approach from  that  adopted  in  its
three predecessor versions, it would have said so.

91. Given that  the  Immigration  Rules  do  not  impose  a  requirement  of
personal savings in the applicant's name only and the Policy  Guidance  does
not purport to impose such  a  requirement  either,  we  see  no  reason  to
preclude reliance on a joint account.

Geographical location of savings

92. There is nothing in the Rules or the Policy Guidance which  prevents  an
applicant meeting the Maintenance (Funds) requirement  by  showing  personal
savings that are held in  an  overseas  bank  or  building  society.  It  is
nowhere said that the statements from a  bank or building society  specified
in 96(i), (ii) or (iii) must be a British or UK bank.

93. We have considered  the  possible  interpretation  that  because  96(iv)
identifies that documents accepted as evidence can include a "letter from  a
financial institution regulated by the Financial Services Authority,  or  in
the case of overseas accounts, the home regulator..." this shows that it  is
only British or UK banks and buildings societies  that  can  be  covered  by
96(i)-(iii). However, if that had been the intention of the drafters of  the
Policy Guidance then they would surely have specified that  in  96(i)-(iii),
particularly  given  the  fact  that  paras   96(i)-(iv)   seek   to   cover
exhaustively the range of admissible types  of  evidence.  It  is  true,  of
course, that all British and UK banks are regulated by the  FSA,  but  there
are many other types of financial institutions  which  are  covered  by  the
phrase "financial institution":  the  FSA  website  mentions,  for  example,
mortgage lenders, insurance brokers and institutions dealing in  securitised
derivatives.

94. Here too we see no reason to read the requirements of  the  scheme  more
restrictively than do the Rules.

The three appellants

95. We are now in a position to state our  findings  on  the  three  appeals
before us.

The first appellant

96. The determination of SIJ  McKee  allowing  the  appellant's  appeal  was
vitiated by legal error. That is because even though required by the  (post-
31 October 2008) Policy Guidance  to show funds of  �800  or  more  for  the
three months immediately preceding the date of application  (  (19  November
2008) the evidence this  appellant  produced  covering  those  three  months
showed that it was only for half that period that  his  balance  was  always
�800 or over. For reasons given earlier, the fact that since 19 November  he
had achieved a three month period during which he held �800  or  over  could
not assist him. The SIJ was wrong to reason that s.85(4)   could  shift  the
relevant three month period to align with matters as they stood at the  date
of hearing. He overlooked that  the  decision  in  this  case  contained  an
historic test tied to the date of application and so "the substance  of  the
decision" had to relate to that time period.

97. It  follows  from  our  earlier  analysis  that  the  decision  we  must
substitute for that of the SIJ is to dismiss the appellant's appeal.

The second appellant

98. Because the  second  appellant  applied  before  31  October  2008,  her
application fell under the transitional provisions set out  in  the  version
of  the  Policy  Guidance  covering  that  period.  Following  our   earlier
analysis, that meant that she only had to produce a  single  bank  statement
dated somewhere between 29 September 2008 and 29 October  2008  (the  latter
being the date of her  application)  showing  a  closing  balance  of  �800.
Accordingly the IJ erred in law in considering that  the  applicant  had  to
show she held �800 or more for a period of one month  immediately  preceding
the application. The IJ's view that  s.85(4)  limited  him  to  taking  into
account "only... circumstances appertaining at  the  time  of  the  hearing"
appears to suggest, wrongly, that pre-hearing circumstances are  irrelevant.
But that aside, the very thing he did in this determination was  ignore  the
date of hearing evidence in the form of the appellant's further evidence  as
to her personal savings during that period.

99. However, it remains to consider whether these errors were  material.  Mr
Tufan submitted that the IJ could not be said to have  materially  erred  in
law in dismissing the appeal, since even if  only  production  of  one  bank
statement showing a closing balance dated within a  month  of  the  date  of
application (29 October 2008) was required, the second appellant had  failed
to comply with that requirement, as the bank statements she  submitted  only
covered dates in September  (10th-25th  September)  which  were  before  the
earliest possible date  allowed,  namely  29  September  2008.  However,  as
already noted, it is not in dispute that subsequent to her  application  and
prior  to  the  hearing  before  the  IJ  she  had  submitted  further  bank
statements covering the period 29 September-29 October  2008.  They  include
statements showing a   closing  balance  of  over  �800  within  the  latter
period. The second appellant was entitled to expect the  IJ  to  have  acted
under s.85(4) of the 2002 Act and to have taken this further  evidence  into
account. Accordingly the IJ's legal error was  material.  Since  the  second
appellant  had  satisfied  the  transitional  requirements  for  Maintenance
(Funds) in full, the decision we must substitute for that of the  IJ  is  to
allow her appeal.

The third appellant

100. As noted earlier,  at  the  time  of  application  this  appellant  had
current leave to remain under the IGS scheme. That  means  that  as  regards
points under "Attributes" and English Language" she stood to  be  considered
under transitional arrangements for persons in  the  IGS,  SEGS  or  FT:WISS
categories: see above paras 21-23. It is not necessary  for  us  to  address
the general issue of whether transitional arrangements for persons in  these
categories effectively  exempt  them  from  the  normal  requirements  under
Appendix C (Maintenance)  to  show  personal  savings  of  �800  over  three
months. That is because this appellant applied before 1  November  2008  and
so in any event fell under the separate transitional arrangements  affecting
every category of applicant applying before that date.

101. Having applied on 3 July 2008, the third appellant would have  been  in
a position to meet the  maintenance  requirement  under  these  transitional
arrangements if she had been able to produce  a  bank  statement  showing  a
closing balance of �800 or over on any day falling in the period 3 June -  3
July 2008. But throughout the whole of  that  period  she  had  no  savings.
Hence, the IJ was correct to dismiss her appeal.  Accordingly  his  decision
must stand. The fact that the third appellant was able to  produce  evidence
during the reconsideration process to show she  now  had  over  �800  for  a
period of three months did not  assist  her.  That  is  because  such  post-
decision evidence did not relate to any date between  3  June-3  July  2008.
The fact that she had a good immigration history and, prior to the new  code
coming into effect had been here  lawfully  for  just  over  10  years,  was
irrelevant.
.
Article 8 ECHR

102. Article 8 was not raised in the first  appellant's  grounds  of  appeal
and, having allowed the appeal under 245Z(e), SIJ McKee  understandably  did
not address it in his determination. In the second appellant's case we  have
allowed her appeal under  para  245Z(e)  and  it  is  hence  unnecessary  to
consider the Article 8 grounds. In the case  of  the  third  appellant,  the
order for reconsideration specifically precluded the Article 8  grounds  and
we see no  reason  to  re-open  the  matter.  Nothing  said  in  this  case,
therefore, deals with the extent  to  which  decisions  refusing  applicants
under the Tier 1 (Post Study Work) scheme can be  challenged  on  Article  8
ECHR grounds. We would venture four observations, however.

103. If we are right in our analysis of the scheme, it is an example of new-
style Immigration  Rules  whereby  the  Secretary  of  State  has  set  down
rigorous criteria which treat transparency and efficiency as key values  and
are so formulated that there are bound to be  hard  cases  or  "near-misses"
that fall through the net. The example we  gave  earlier  of  a  person  who
meets all the requirements save for having his or her personal savings  fall
below �800 even for one day during the requisite three month  period  is  in
point. As we know from the case of GOO, one response the Secretary of  State
may make to challenges to the stringency of such Rules  would  be  to  point
out that there is always the possibility that the respondent will decide  in
the exercise of her residual discretion  to  grant  limited  leave  in  this
category notwithstanding failings of this kind. Of course, it might be  said
that the Policy  Guidance  rather  limits  the  forms  such  an  examination
outside-the-rules might take, at least in the context of  an  appeal,  since
its final paragraph makes clear that administrative review is not  available
in in-country appeals. However, unlike the situation  in  GOO,  where  their
Lordships rejected the respondent's invocation  of  her  power  of  residual
discretion  and saw scope (based on the acquis of relevant law)  for a  more
liberal construction of evaluative terms  such  as  "satisfactory  progress"
contained within the Rules, there appear to be no similar  evaluative  terms
within the Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) scheme.

104. Secondly, Article 8 is not to be equated with  an  obligation  to  take
into account compassionate circumstances.

105. Thirdly, whilst it is possible for a student in the course  of  his  or
her studies (and part-time working, if applicable) to  have  developed  over
time ties with the community  that  amount  to  significant  elements  of  a
private life within the meaning of  Article  8  (a  student  may  also  have
maintained or developed incidental family life ties here), they are  persons
who have come to the UK for a limited purpose and  with  no  expectation  of
being able to stay except by meeting the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
Rules. They do not thereby acquire a right to remain in the UK  despite  the
Immigration Rules. A refusal under the Tier 1 (Post-Study) scheme  may  mean
they fail to make their immigration prospects better; it does not mean  they
have been made worse.

106. Fourth, when the Tier 1 (Post-Study) Work  scheme  was  introduced  the
government decided it was appropriate to make transitional  arrangements  of
two kinds: one so as to ensure that those students who had leave under  pre-
existing schemes for highly skilled students - for IGS, SEGS and FT: WISS  -
 had a chance to apply under the new scheme; the other so as to ensure  that
all  applicants  who  had  had  little  time  to  adjust   their   financial
circumstances so as to comply with the new requirement  to  show  they  held
�800 for three-months  immediately  preceding  their  application  were  not
unfairly disadvantaged. Put another way,  the  new  Post-Study  Work  scheme
have already incorporated  provisions  designed  to  assist  applicants  who
might otherwise have been disadvantaged by the terms in which and the  speed
with  which  they  were  introduced.  In   respect   of   the   transitional
arrangements affecting maintenance, they have  enabled  applicants  to  know
sufficiently in advance the requirements they were expected to fulfil.
