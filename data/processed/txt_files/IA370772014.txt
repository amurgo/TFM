                           KANAYOCHUKWU SAMUEL EKA
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                        NOTICE OF CONSENT TO WITHDRAW

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 3  June  1988.  He  first
    entered the United Kingdom as a student on  26  September  2005.  On  9
    November 2011 he was granted leave to remain as  a  tier  1  post-study
    migrant until 9 November 2013. On 21 October 2013 he married his  wife,
    who is a British Citizen. On 5 November 2013 he applied  for  leave  to
    remain on the basis of this marriage.

 2. The appellant's application  was  refused  by  the  respondent  on  the
    grounds that he did not satisfy the requirements of Appendix FM or Rule
    276ADE of the Immigration Rules.  The requirements of Appendix FM  were
    not met because the appellant's  annual  income  was  �16,111,  falling
    short of the required �18,600; and it was  found  that  there  were  no
    insurmountable obstacles such that the exception in EX.1 should  apply.
    With regard to Rule 276ADE, the respondent was not satisfied  that  the
    appellant could meet the requirements.

 3. In a decision promulgated on 29 April  2015,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissed the appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules and  under
    Article 8 ECHR. The appellant applied for and was granted permission to
    appeal.

 4. By notice given on 5 October  2015  the  appellant  sought  consent  to
    withdraw his appeal. In accordance with section 17(2) of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure Rules consent to withdraw is given.

 5. This matter is at an end and the decision of the  First  tier  Tribunal
    promulgated on 29 April 2015 shall stand.

|                                     |                                     |
