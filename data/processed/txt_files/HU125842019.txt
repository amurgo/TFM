Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms C. Bayati, instructed by Amirthan & Suresh
Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms A. Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant appealed the respondent's decision dated 08 July 2019  to
    refuse a human rights claim by a notice of  appeal  filed  on  22  July
    2019.  The appellant named Kothala & Co as her legal representatives.

2.   The appellant was sent a notice of hearing  on  30  July  2019,  for  a
    hearing date on  28  October  2019  i.e.  three  months'  notice.   The
    appellant's new legal representatives, Amirthan  &  Suresh  Solicitors,
    made a written adjournment application on 21 October 2019  because  (i)
    there had been a delay in transferring the  papers  from  her  previous
    legal representatives; (ii) on perusal of the papers it was  a  complex
    matter that required  further  preparation;  (iii)  the  appellant  had
    'mental issues' which needed to be explored; and (iv)  they  could  not
    complete her witness statement without the complete set of papers  from
    the previous  representatives.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  refused  the
    application on 23 October 2020.

3.   A further written application was made on 23 October  2020  asking  for
    the decision to be reviewed stating that the  previous  representatives
    had done nothing to progress her case and the appellant had reluctantly
    decided to instruct a different firm. The application referred  to  her
    'age and medical condition'  without  particularising  why  this  might
    justify an adjournment. The First-tier Tribunal refused the application
    on 25 October 2020 on the ground that the appellant had sufficient time
    to prepare for the appeal.

4.   First-tier Tribunal Judge Abebrese  ("the  judge")  refused  a  renewed
    oral application for an adjournment at the hearing on 28  October  2020
    in the following terms:

         "6.  The appellant (sic) representative made an application  for  a
         (sic) adjournment of the hearing on the  basis  that  she  required
         more time to prepare for the appeal. The application was considered
         on 24 October 2019 by the tribunal and it was dismissed because the
         appellant had been provided with notice of the appeal hearing on 25
         July 2019 and she therefore had ample opportunity  to  prepare  for
         the hearing on 28 October 2019. It was  noted  further  that  there
         were no documents to suggest that the appellant has  mental  issues
         and the assertions of the appellant are speculative and unsupported
         by any medical evidence.

         7.   The application for an adjournment was renewed before me by Ms
         Allen and I found no reason to  reach  a  different  conclusion  as
         stated in the paragraph above. It [was] submitted by Ms Allen  that
         the  appellant  had  changed  legal   representatives   and   those
         instructing her were  in  the  process  of  obtaining  all  of  the
         documents from them in order to prepare the appellant's  appeal.  I
         was referred to the appellant's Solicitors (sic)  letter  dated  21
         October 2019 and received by the tribunal on 23 October  2019.  The
         letter states that an adjournment is sought because of the delay in
         the transfer of documents from the appellant's previous  Solicitors
         (sic) and that the appellant has a complex immigration history  and
         that matters raised in this appeal  are  complex.  The  appellant's
         mental issues it is suggested has made in  necessary  for  them  to
         prepare a detailed witness statement.

         8.   I considered the submissions of Ms Allen and I determined that
         the appellant had been aware of the hearing for some time and  that
         she has had opportunity to prepare her appeal and that it  was  her
         sole decision to change her legal representatives so close  to  the
         hearing date. I was not provided with any plausible evidence as  to
         why she decided to change legal  represntatives  so  close  to  the
         hearing date of the appeal.

         9.   I was referred to the appellant's mental issues but I was  not
         provided with any supporting evidence which I would [have] expected
         bearing in mind the appellant's long immigration history and length
         of time that she has been in the UK."

5.   The judge recorded that counsel 'did not  call  any  evidence  and  she
    made no further submissions'. It is apparent from counsel's  subsequent
    witness statement  that  she  was  only  instructed  to  apply  for  an
    adjournment and in fact withdrew from the case when the application was
    refused.  The judge  dismissed  the  appeal  on  the  ground  that  the
    appellant did not meet  the  private  life  requirements  of  paragraph
    276ADE of the immigration rules. She did  not  meet  the  20-year  long
    residence requirement. She had spent most of her life in Sri Lanka. She
    had failed to produce sufficient evidence to show that she  would  face
    'very significant obstacles' to integration. The judge  concluded  that
    there  was  insufficient  evidence  to  show  that  removal  would   be
    disproportionate given the lack of evidence from the appellant  or  her
    son. The appeal was dismissed on human rights grounds.

6.   The appellant appeals the First-tier Tribunal decision  on  the  ground
    that it was unfair to refuse the adjournment request.  The  application
    for permission to appeal included a  letter  from  the  appellant's  GP
    dated 02 December 2019, which stated that the  appellant  attended  the
    surgery on 29 October 2019 (the day after the hearing) and was  treated
    for a chest infection.

7.   First-tier Tribunal Judge Foudy granted permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal in an order sent on 27 May 2020. Further directions were
    sent to the parties in response to which the respondent replied:

         "4.   The  SSHD  notes  that  whilst  the  pre-hearing  adjournment
         requests had been refused there had been no previous adjournment of
         the hearing to indicate  an  attempt  to  systematically  frustrate
         proceedings. The age of the Appellant plausibly supports ill health
         at short notice. It is acknowledged that the FTTJ (Para 8) attached
         weight to  a  lack  of  'plausible  evidence'  for  the  change  of
         representation.  Whilst   this   may   be   appropriate   under   a
         'reasonableness' assessment the test  was  one  of  'fairness'.  On
         balance on the evidence available to the author it appears that the
         refusal of the adjournment request lacked appropriate consideration
         of the factors holistically in the  context  of  a  decision  under
         'fairness'. However, in the absence of access to  the  SSHD's  file
         and the HOPO's record of proceedings  the  SSHD  does  not  concede
         material error, but adopts a neutral stance on the issue."

8.   In light of this response it is possible that  the  appeal  could  have
    been determined without a hearing, but the case was listed for a remote
    hearing at the request of the appellant's representative. By  the  time
    the case came to hearing both parties agreed  that  it  was  unfair  to
    proceed to determine the appeal without the appellant or  any  evidence
    in support. I agree. Even if there was no medical evidence,  there  was
    nothing in the history of the appeal  to  suggest  that  the  appellant
    might simply be seeking to delay proceedings. It was plausible that  an
    80 year old woman might have age related health problems  even  if  the
    application made by her legal representative was vague and  unsupported
    by medical evidence. Evidence submitted with this application indicates
    that the appellant was likely to have been unwell as claimed. The  fact
    that no evidence had been submitted in support of the appeal  supported
    the  appellant's  explanation  as  to   why   she   chose   to   change
    representatives shortly before the hearing. She was  dissatisfied  with
    the lack of preparation by her previous representatives.

9.   I conclude that the First-tier Tribunal decision  involved  the  making
    of an error of law. The decision is set aside. I agree with the parties
    that the appellant was denied a hearing and that it is  appropriate  to
    remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.



DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making of an error on a  point
of law

The case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing
