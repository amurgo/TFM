                               MUBASHAR SAFEER
                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION not made)

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan.

 2. The Appellant appeals against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal,
    who in a determination promulgated on 13th September 2017 dismissed his
    appeal under the EEA Regulations 2006.

 3. In directions sent on the  5th  April  and  in  the  light  of  Khan  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA  Civ  1755,  the
    First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal on the basis  that  it
    was arguably wrong in law to  have  concluded  that  it  did  not  have
    jurisdiction to hear the appeal.



 4. The Upper Tribunal stated that it was minded to find an  error  of  law
    and to set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and remit  the
    case to the First-tier Tribunal.
 5. A party who is opposed to  this  course  was  directed  to  inform  the
    Tribunal in writing (giving reasons), not later than 7  days  from  the
    date this decision is  sent  by  the  Upper  Tribunal.  Following  that
    period, the Upper Tribunal will issue its decision.

 6. No reply has been received to those directions and in the circumstances
    I am satisfied that the determination involves the making of  an  error
    on a point of law for the reasons set out in the grounds..

 7. Therefore The FTT decision (Judge Oliver) should be set aside and  that
    the appeal should be remitted to the FTT for a hearing de novo before a
    First-tier Judge other than Judge Oliver.
