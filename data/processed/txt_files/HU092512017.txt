                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an approved transcript of an  extempore  decision  and  reasons
    given on 12 March 2019.  This is the hearing of an  appeal  by  Danovan
    [B] against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Andrew.   The
    judge dismissed Mr [B]'s appeal against the decision of  the  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department to refuse Mr [B]'s human rights  claim
    and ordered his deportation from the United Kingdom.

2.   Permission to appeal out of time was  granted  on  15th  January  2019.
    This was on the basis that it  was  arguable  that  there  had  been  a
    procedural irregularity because it was arguable that  Mr  [B]  was  not
    aware of the date of the hearing before the judge.  Mr [B] prepared his
    own notice of appeal and he set out his reasons  for  applying  for  an
    extension of time in that document saying:

         "I did not receive the letter from the court as I was in prison,  I
         would like to apply for an extension of time.  I was not  in  court
         when they made the hearing.  I was unaware the hearing took  place.
         Therefore happened in my absence."

    The reasons given for appealing by Mr [B] were:

         "The judge made the wrong decision to refuse my appeal.  The  judge
         did not consider the rights of the child, humanitarian  protection,
         Article 8 European Convention on Human Rights."

    And when requesting an oral hearing of the appeal Mr [B] wrote:

         "I would like the chance to get a fair hearing and being present in
         court will help me better convey in person my grounds."

3.   In other parts of the form Mr [B]  explained  that  he  was  in  prison
    which explains why he did not receive correspondence about  the  appeal
    and he said that he had last seen his children on a prison  visit.   He
    completed the notice of appeal on 22nd November 2018  and  he  said  he
    hoped to get out of prison  either  on  30th  November  which  was  his
    birthday or Christmas.

4.   The relevant background is taken from a judgment which was  dated  15th
    February 2018.  I am not in a position to  make  findings  of  fact  in
    relation to those matters but they represent the best information about
    what has happened to date.  It appears from that judgment that  Mr  [B]
    arrived as a visitor from Jamaica in 2002 and it appears  that  he  had
    other family members in Jamaica.  He was granted  indefinite  leave  to
    remain on 9th October 2003  as  a  spouse  and  it  appears  that  that
    marriage ended in 2007.  Mr [B] then formed a  relationship  with  Miss
    [DF], and we are  grateful  for  her  attendance  and  assistance  this
    morning, with whom he had twin boys who are British citizens.

5.   Mr [B] and Miss [F] separated in 2009 and it appears that Miss [F]  has
    subsequently remarried.  Ms [F] also has an elder child.   Mr  [B]  was
    reported to have said that he was fully  engaged  with  the  twins  and
    picked them up from school each day and then  took  them  to  his  flat
    while Miss [F] worked a later shift.  Mr [B] had said  in  evidence  at
    the previous hearing that  the  academic  progress  of  the  twins  had
    suffered when he was in prison and Miss [F]'s mother had  assisted  but
    Mr [B] said that Miss [F] was barely managing and  it  was  noted  that
    Miss [F] lived about an hour from Mr [B] and that he had the twins  for
    a couple of hours each day and he would see them  at  weekends  and  on
    holidays.  It appears from a previous judgment that Mr [B] had begun  a
    relationship with [RR] in 2010 an Italian  national  who  came  to  the
    United Kingdom to study and she lived with  her  mother  while  Mr  [B]
    lived on his own and they saw each other twice a week.

6.   On 12th August 2016 Mr [B] was convicted of importing 22  kilograms  of
    cannabis into the United Kingdom from Jamaica and was given 27  months'
    imprisonment.  The sentencing remarks show that Mr  [B]  had  not  been
    involved in the planning of the drug importation, that he was not going
    to derive a direct profit from the sale of drugs and  had  performed  a
    relatively limited function under direction.

7.   The Secretary of State made a decision to deport Mr [B] but his  appeal
    was allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Parkes following a hearing  on
    31st January 2018 in a decision promulgated on 15th February 2018.   It
    appears that at that hearing Mr [B] and Miss  [DF]  gave  evidence  and
    this showed that Mr [B] had assisted Miss [F] so that she was  able  to
    work.

8.   The Secretary of State appealed  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Parkes and permission to appeal was granted on 21st June
    2018 and it is then that the missing part of the picture which has been
    provided today comes into play.  It appears that Mr [B] was accused  of
    an incident involving his former partner and  was  then  remanded  into
    custody at Wormwood Prison.  That was because he was already on licence
    and therefore was liable to be recalled if there was any  part  of  the
    sentence still to be served at the time that he  was  accused  of  this
    further crime.  Mr [B] was then kept in Wormwood Scrubs Prison until he
    says about November 2018.  There is a  slip  of  paper  in  the  papers
    before us which shows that Mr  [B]  was  released  from  Her  Majesty's
    Prison Birmingham on 23rd August 2018.  Doing the best we  can  on  the
    information before us it appears that that must have been at  the  time
    at which Mr [B]'s original sentence had expired meaning that his recall
    from licence ended and he was then remanded  in  custody  awaiting  the
    charges of which he was then tried at the Magistrates' Court.  I should
    as a matter of fairness to Mr [B] say that the  information  before  us
    shows that he was then not convicted of the charge, but  this  explains
    where he was when the first appeal was heard in his absence  in  August
    2018.

9.   The appeal hearing was on 6th August 2018 before Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Finch and on 13th August 2018 the appeal was allowed and the appeal was
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal Judge for a de novo hearing.   That
    is significant because it is important to the disposal of this  hearing
    today to note that it was recognised that it was necessary  to  have  a
    full and fair hearing of all the points raised by Mr [B]'s  case.   The
    Upper Tribunal Judge had found that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  had
    made an error in law in failing to apply the relevant  test  about  the
    meaning of unduly harsh and it is not necessary  for  the  purposes  of
    this judgment to set out the relevant jurisprudence.

10.  This was the background leading up to the  hearing  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge in October 2018.  It appears that Mr [B] was sent a
    notice of the hearing on 21st August 2018 for the  hearing  in  October
    2018 but as is now apparent from the further information he  was  still
    at that time in Wormwood Scrubs Prison.  It appears that Mr [B] was  at
    some stage, probably after the trial in the Magistrate' Court, released
    from Wormwood Scrubs Prison and taken directly to Hatton Cross  hearing
    centre where he was remanded  into  custody  at  Colnbrook  immigration
    removal centre.  That detention explains his continuing absence for the
    period of time when the remitted hearing took place.  The  reasons  for
    the refusal of immigration bail were that Mr  [B]  had  apparently  not
    attended his  last  hearing.   That  was  not  particularly  surprising
    because he did not know about the hearing.  Mr  [B]  was  then  granted
    bail at some stage just before Christmas 2018.

11.  The remitted appeal before the First Tier Tribunal took place  on  24th
    October 2018 at Priory Court Birmingham.  As noted above Mr [B] did not
    appear and was not represented, and Ms Mepstead appeared on  behalf  of
    the Secretary of State.  The reasons and decisions were promulgated  on
    30th October 2018 and then came to the attention of Mr [B] when he  was
    in detention in the circumstances that I described.

12.  So far as is material there is an entitlement to  hear  proceedings  in
    the absence of a party.  If a party fails to  attend  the  hearing  the
    Tribunal may proceed with the hearing if satisfied that the  party  has
    been notified of that hearing or that reasonable steps have been  taken
    to notify that party and it is in the interests of justice  to  proceed
    with the hearing.  In circumstances where it is now  apparent  that  Mr
    [B] did not receive notice of the hearing because he was  in  detention
    and in circumstances  where  it  is  apparent  that  there  was  proper
    material for Mr [B] to advance at that remitted hearing it  is  plainly
    necessary to set aside the judgment of the First-tier Tribunal.

13.  So far as disposal  is  concerned  it  is  common  ground  between  the
    parties, and we agree, that this matter must be remitted  back  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge so that that judge can  approach  fairly  all
    the matters in the light of the submissions and the relevant  governing
    law.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  on
a point of law and is set aside.

The case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be hear afresh.
