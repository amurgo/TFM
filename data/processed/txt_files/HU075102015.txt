                            DECISION AND REASONS

Claim History

    1. Although the Secretary of State is the Appellant before us,  we  will
       for ease of reference refer to her as the Respondent as she  was  the
       Respondent before the First-tier Tribunal at the hearing on 9 January
       2015. Similarly, we will refer to Mr Ahmed as the Appellant as he was
       the Appellant before the First-tier Tribunal.

    2. The appeal of the Appellant against the refusal of the Respondent  to
       grant him further leave to remain in the UK  as  the  spouse  of  Mrs
       Zubaira Begum, a British citizen by birth was allowed  by  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge I F Taylor (the Judge)  under  Article  8  ECHR  in  a
       decision promulgated on 14  November  2016.  The  background  to  the
       refusal, as taken from the Judge's decision, is as follows:

           "4. ...The appellant and his wife married in Pakistan on  the  5
           August 2010. Following the wedding the appellant lived with  his
           wife in Pakistan for about 3 months following  which  Mrs  Begum
           returned to the UK so that she could sponsor  the  appellant  to
           join her in the UK as his spouse. The appellant  made  an  entry
           clearance application to join his spouse which was  refused.  He
           appealed this decision and his appeal was allowed. The appellant
           was granted leave as a spouse, valid from 20 March  2013  to  20
           June 2015 and he entered the United  Kingdom  on  the  16  April
           2013. Since that date the  appellant  and  his  wife  have  been
           cohabiting in the UK. The appellant made a  further  application
           for leave to remain as a spouse on 11 May 2015.  At  this  point
           the appellant states that he was unaware that he had to pay  the
           Immigration Health  Surcharge  (IHS)  which  had  recently  been
           introduced. On 15 May 2015 he received three  letters  from  the
           Home office (a) informing of the need to  submit  his  biometric
           information, (b) informing him that he had not paid his IHS  fee
           and (c) a letter to acknowledge receipt of his application.  The
           appellant states  that  at  this  point  he  did  not  know  the
           importance of the letter about non-payment of the IHS fee and as
           a consequence he didn't do anything about it. On 7 July 2015 the
           appellant received a letter from the Home  Office  refusing  his
           application. At this point the  appellant  sought  legal  advice
           from a voluntary advice centre who suggested that he pay the IHS
           fee immediately which he did on 10 July 2015 by  cheque.  On  13
           July 2015 the Home Office  deposited  the  cheque  for  ï¿½500  in
           respect of the IHS fees for the first application.  However,  on
           28 July 2015 the Home Office said they were going to return  the
           fee. On 8 August 2015 the appellant lodged a  fresh  application
           inviting the Home Office to keep the fees already paid  for  the
           IHS. However, on 13 August 2015 the Home Office returned his IHS
           fees for his first application.  It  appears  that  the  letters
           between the Appellant and the Home Office crossed and  it  seems
           that the Home Office did not get the appellant's leave to remain
           application before they returned the IHS fees. On 14 August 2015
           the appellant again received 3  letters  from  the  Home  Office
           seeking his biometrics and informing him that the  IHS  fee  had
           not been paid and an acknowledgement  of  his  application.  The
           appellant again paid the IHS fee on 26 August 2016 and this  fee
           is still held by the Home  Office.  On  29  September  2015  the
           appellant's application for further leave to remain was  refused
           and is the subject  of  the  appeal  before  me.  The  appellant
           acknowledges that he made a mistake with the IHS fee but that he
           was confused and he didn't appreciate that it was a  requirement
           of his application."

    3. The Respondent appealed against that decision for,  in  essence,  the
       following reasons:

             a. The Immigration Rules (the Rules) provided  better  explicit
                coverage of the factors identified in case law  as  relevant
                to the analysis of claims under  Article  8  ECHR  than  was
                formerly the position.  Article  8  should  only  have  been
                considered  if  there  were  arguably   good   grounds   for
                considering  Article  8;   that   is,   where   there   were
                sufficiently compelling circumstances not recognised by  the
                Immigration Rules. The Judge recognised this at [20] but the
                genuine mistake in failing to  pay  the  immigration  health
                surcharge (IHS) and the fact that the Appellant  was  highly
                regarded in his community did not come near  the  compelling
                circumstances threshold. The Judge should not have  gone  on
                to consider the appeal under Article 8 (Singh v SSHD  [2015]
                EWCA Civ 74). Inadequate reasons were given to show why  the
                failure to pay  the  IHS  resulted  in  the  proportionality
                assessment falling in the Appellant's favour.

             b. SS (Congo) EWCA Civ 387 provided that the Rules  identified,
                for the purposes of the application of Article 8, the degree
                of weight to be attached to the expression of public  policy
                in the substantive part of the Rules applicable to the  case
                in question. In the Appellant's case, the only reference the
                Judge made to the public interest was at [24] when he  found
                "However, the most significant consideration  in  favour  of
                the Appellant is the fact that he  made  a  genuine  mistake
                which has given rise to consequences that are  unduly  harsh
                and without regard to the legitimate public end sought to be
                achieved". This finding is inadequately reasoned.

    4. Permission was granted in the following terms:

           "the grounds disclosed an arguable material error of law but for
           which the outcome of the appeal might have been  different.  The
           judge made an arguable error of law in not according any or  any
           adequate weight to a material consideration. The Judge  did  not
           accord any or any  adequate  weight  to  those  public  interest
           considerations mentioned in s 117B of the Immigration  Act  2014
           as inserted after Part 5  of  the  Nationality  Immigration  and
           Asylum Act 2002. The sole reference  which  the  Judge  made  to
           public interest  considerations  was  at  paragraph  24  of  the
           judge's decision where the judge stated,

                "If the respondent could demonstrate grounds beyond that  of
                the public interest in immigration control  or  criminal  or
                anti-social  behaviour  of  the  appellant,  the   balancing
                exercise may well have fallen in favour of the respondent."

           The Judge did not  overtly  or  tacitly  accord  weight  to  the
           maintenance of effective immigration controls as  being  in  the
           public interest..."

    5. At the hearing, we indicated that our preliminary view was that there
       was a  material  error  of  law  in  that  all  the  public  interest
       considerations had not been brought into play in the  proportionality
       assessment. We did however, hear full submissions from  both  parties
       on all issues, at the end of which we reserved our decision, which we
       give below together with our reasons.



Submissions on behalf of the Appellant

    6. Mr Trevelyan relied on his skeleton argument.  His  oral  submissions
       were:

             a. The Judge  expressly  had  regard  to  the  public  interest
                factors at [22]. He  referred  to  the  public  interest  in
                immigration control, and that little weight should be  given
                to a private life or a relationship formed at the  time  the
                person was in the UK  unlawfully,  and  that  little  weight
                should be given to a private life established  by  a  person
                whose immigration status was precarious.

             b. At [23] the Judge stated that nearly all of the  Appellant's
                time in the UK was lawful, except for a small amount of time
                that may be unlawful or  precarious,  which  occurred  as  a
                result of a genuine mistake. Mr Trevelyan emphasised that an
                important component of the Judge's decision was that it  was
                accepted by both parties that failure to pay the IHS  charge
                was a genuine mistake.

             c. At [24] the Judge again stated that the  issue  was  one  of
                proportionality and that  a  genuine  mistake,  against  the
                background of an entirely lawful stay in the UK of three and
                a half years resulted in the public interest  being  reduced
                and  he  stated  that  "...in  the  unusual  and  individual
                circumstances of this case result in the public interest  in
                removal being reduced and the  individual  circumstances  of
                the appellant and his partner being increased."

    7. Mr Trevelyan accepted that the economic wellbeing of the UK  had  not
       expressly been referred to but he submitted that s 117B only provided
       for  decision-makers  to  have  regard   to   the   public   interest
       considerations and they were not a definitive checklist.

Submissions on behalf of the Respondent

    8. The grant was not limited  to  the  s  117B  point.  There  was  also
       insufficient reasoning  as  to  the  compelling  circumstances  which
       resulted in the public interest being outweighed. At [24]  the  Judge
       referred to fertility treatment, property,  immigration  history  and
       genuine mistake.

    9. As to the fertility  treatment  being  received  by  the  Appellant's
       partner, Erimako R (on the application of) v  SSHD  [2008]  EWCA  312
       (Admin) was handed up at the hearing, which  decided  that  fertility
       treatment could only be a limited factor. The Judge did not note  the
       guidance in caselaw. As to property, there  was  no  suggestion  that
       they would need to sell it. The Judge had found that  there  were  no
       surmountable obstacles to family life continuing in Pakistan but  the
       Appellant's stay in Pakistan need not be permanent or  long-term.  As
       to the Appellant's immigration history, the Judge was  mistaken  that
       the Appellant had only been in the UK without leave for a very  small
       amount of time. When he made his  second  application  for  leave  to
       remain, he was 32 days out of  time,  which  meant  that  his  second
       application was out of time; he did not  have  s  3C  leave  and  had
       therefore been in the UK unlawfully since his last leave expired on 7
       July 2015 and the Judge seemed to have been  unaware  of  this  fact.
       There is a statutory direction to limit  weight  where  there  is  no
       leave and the failure to  appreciate  that  the  Appellant  had  been
       without leave for a significant period of time was a  material  error
       of law.

   10. It was unclear what the Judge meant when he stated that "However, the
       most significant consideration in favour of the appellant is that  he
       made a genuine mistake which has given rise to consequences that  are
       unduly harsh and without justification with regard to the  legitimate
       public end to be achieved..." Was he stating that there was no public
       interest in paying the IHS charge? Clearly paying the IHS is  in  the
       public interest and the Judge's view affected the weight he  gave  to
       the public interest.

Response on behalf of the Appellant

   11. The Judge referred to the 'compelling circumstances' in this case  in
       [20], and these were the Appellant's  excellent  immigration  history
       until the failure to pay  the  surcharge;  the  failure  to  pay  the
       surcharge was accepted by both parties as a genuine mistake;  it  was
       not malicious and he had  in  fact  paid  it;  he  had  done  all  he
       reasonably could to correct the position; he was  a  highly  regarded
       member of his  community.  The  Judge  found  these  were  compelling
       circumstances, and, having applied the provisions of s 117B, that  it
       was disproportionate to  remove.  Even  if  the  Judge  had  properly
       identified the period of lawful leave, this would not  have  affected
       his analysis.

   12. On conclusion of the submissions, we  rose  for  our  discussion.  On
       resuming the hearing, we confirmed that our decision was  that  there
       was a material error of law and that our  written  reasons  would  be
       sent out in due course. Our reasons we now set out below.

Reasons for Error of law decision

   13. There is significant focus within the decision, and  at  the  hearing
       before us, on the Appellant's mistake in failing to pay his  IHS  fee
       with his first application being genuine and the  consequences  being
       unduly harsh for the Appellant and his partner against a backdrop  of
       an entirely lawful stay bar a very small period of  time  which  "may
       have been unlawful or precarious" [23].  As to these issues  we  find
       as follows:

             a. The Appellant accepted that he had not paid the IHS fee.  It
                can be inferred that the Judge accepted that the Appellant's
                application made on 11 May 2015 was rejected because of non-
                payment of the IHS charge. It can also be inferred that  the
                Judge accepted that the Appellant's second application, made
                on 8 August 2015 after the 28 day grace period permitted  by
                the Rules, was out of time due to the Judge's  reference  of
                the "very small amount of  time  that  may  be  unlawful  or
                precarious as a result of a genuine mistake" at [23]. Having
                submitted his second application after  the  28  day  period
                permitted by  the  Rules,  the  Appellant's  leave  was  not
                continued under s 3C of the Immigration  Act  1971,  from  7
                July  2015,  when  the  Appellant's  first  application  was
                rejected  by  the  Respondent.  This  was  accepted  by   Mr
                Trevelyan.

             b. The Appellant was lawfully in the UK between 20  March  2013
                and 7 July 2015. He was unlawfully in the UK between 8  July
                2015 and the date of hearing, which was 31 October  2016,  a
                period of over 15 months.  We find that the Judge  erred  in
                stating that the Appellant had only overstayed  by  a  "very
                small amount of time", against  the  majority  of  his  stay
                which had been entirely  lawful.  Overstaying  is  a  factor
                which would weigh significantly in the public  side  of  the
                balance in a proportionality assessment under  s  117B  (1),
                even if the weight in relation to the  s  117  (4)  and  (5)
                factors is reduced because the Appellant's relationship with
                his partner and his private life were not  established  when
                he was in the UK unlawfully.  When  considering  the  public
                interest in immigration control,  the  Respondent  does  not
                need to point to criminality or anti-social behaviour to tip
                the balance in favour of the  public  interest  (see  [24]);
                immigration control is in itself a weighty consideration.

             c. There was no mention by the Judge of the public interest  in
                the economic wellbeing of the  UK,  the  s  117(2)  and  (3)
                factors. The Judge states that "...if the appellant  decides
                to make a fresh application under Appendix FM within the  UK
                he may well meet the financial requirement  of  ï¿½18,600  per
                annum as he has only been out of work for a period  of  four
                or five weeks" [17] There is, however,  no  analysis  as  to
                whether or not the Appellant is financially independent  and
                no reference to his ability to  speak  English.  Judges  are
                statutorily required  to  have  regard  to  all  the  s  117
                considerations (Dube (ss 117B-117D) [2015]  UKUT  90  (IAC).
                This factor is relevant  because  the  Appellant  no  longer
                qualified for  leave  under  para  284  of  the  Rules;  his
                application was now to be assessed under the  provisions  of
                Appendix FM, under the 10 year  route,  and  the  Judge  was
                alive to this when he referred to the  possible  ability  of
                the Appellant to meet the ï¿½18,600 threshold at [17], and his
                application of the provisions of Appendix FM para EX.1(b) at
                [15 - 19].

             d. The Respondent found that the Appellant could not  meet  the
                provisions of the Rules because he had not paid his IHS fee.
                 He was given the opportunity to do so when  the  Respondent
                wrote to him on 15 May 2015, stating that the  IHS  fee  had
                not been paid. He did nothing about  it  until  his  initial
                application was rejected for non-payment of  the  fee  on  7
                July 2015, a period of nearly 2 months. If he  was  confused
                about payment of the IHS, and no one was suggesting that the
                mistake was anything but innocent, he did not choose to seek
                advice as to why he had been asked to pay it. He effectively
                ignored the issue until his  application  was  rejected.  He
                was, in effect the author of  his  own  misfortune  and  the
                mistake, though innocent, was entirely avoidable. No reasons
                are given in the decision as to why advice was not sought at
                an earlier stage.

   14. We find that by in effect glossing over the details in the case,  the
       Judge did not give sufficient attention to the factors in the  public
       interest side of the balance in his proportionality assessment, which
       resulted in a material error of law. Had the Judge addressed his mind
       to all the public interest factors, his decision may well  have  been
       different. We would set aside his decision on this basis alone.

   15. Mr Mills also submitted that the Judge's  decision  was  inadequately
       reasoned because it was not clear why the factors in  favour  of  the
       Appellant were 'compelling'  reasons  for  a  grant  of  leave  under
       Article 8. The reasons given by the Judge as amounting to  compelling
       circumstances were:

             a. The Appellant's  partner's  fertility  treatment.  Mr  Mills
                submitted, and we accept,  that  the  receipt  of  fertility
                treatment can only carry limited weight in  the  Appellant's
                side of the balance (Erimko).

             b. The Appellant's standing in the community.  This  can  carry
                little weight (UE (Nigeria) and others v  SSHD  [2010]  EWCA
                Civ 975).  Furthermore, this part of his  private  life  was
                strengthened at a time when he had no leave to remain in the
                UK.

             c. As to the property that is owned by the  Appellant  and  his
                wife, the Judge stated that it might be  lost  because  they
                could not make the mortgage repayments (the Appellant's wife
                is not working because she is  focussing  on  the  fertility
                treatment). However, we had no evidence that the Appellant's
                wife could not work whilst undergoing fertility treatment if
                necessary. The Judge did not rule out a further  application
                "either in Pakistan or in the United Kingdom"  [6].  It  was
                open to the Appellant to make a further application, showing
                that he was able to meet the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM
                such that the only factor in the Respondent's  side  of  the
                balance was the policy requirement to  make  an  application
                from abroad ((Treebhowan and Hayat v SSHD  [2012]  EWCA  Civ
                1054)).

             d. The Appellant's lawful stay. Whilst it is correct  that  the
                Appellant made  an  out  of  country  application  prior  to
                entering, and  made  an  initial  in  time  application  for
                further leave to remain, he has been without leave  since  7
                July 2015, a factor not recognised by the Judge.

   16. We find that as the public interest factors  had  not  been  properly
       assessed, it is difficult to say that the Judge has provided adequate
       reasons to establish that 'compelling reasons' for a grant  of  leave
       outside the Rules have been established,  or  that  adequate  reasons
       have been given for saying why the balance tipped in  favour  of  the
       Appellant and his wife.

   17. We find that the Judge materially erred in law and we set  aside  his
       decision.

   18. As to the remaking of the decision, Mr Trevelyan stated that  he  had
       taken instructions and  these  were  that  there  was  no  additional
       evidence to be provided; the position today was exactly the  same  as
       it was before the first-tier Tribunal and he would proceed by way  of
       submissions only.

Submissions on re-making the decision on behalf of the Appellant

   19.  Mr  Trevelyan  accepted  that  the  Appellant  could  not  meet  the
       Immigration Rules because he had overstayed by a couple of  days  but
       submitted that this was exactly the sort of case where the compelling
       circumstances threshold was met because the Appellant had done all he
       reasonably could to comply with the Rules. He had  made  an  in  time
       application.  He  had  made  an  honest  mistake  resulting  in   his
       application being out of time by a few days, and  this  is  just  the
       sort  of  case  where  Article  8  can  provide  relief  due  to  the
       inflexibility of the 28 day rule.

   20. The Article 8 test was proportionality. It is accepted that there  is
       a genuine and  subsisting  relationship.  The  consequences  for  the
       Appellant and his wife were disproportionate; the Appellant had never
       sought to evade immigration control;  he  made  an  application  from
       abroad and secured entry clearance. There was therefore little public
       interest in removal. As to s 117 B (4) and (5), there was nothing  to
       limit the weight to be attached to  the  relationship.  He  submitted
       that the question was whether it was  proportionate  to  require  the
       Appellant  to  sever  family  ties  and  make  an   entry   clearance
       application all because of one mistake and overstaying for five days.

Submissions on behalf of Respondent

   21. Although it  was  submitted  that  the  Appellant  did  all  that  he
       reasonably could do, he (i) did not pay the IHS  surcharge,  (ii)  he
       did not make a valid in time application; the Rules were  clear,  the
       IHS had to be paid; and (iii) he then overstayed  for  more  than  28
       days. Rather than the 28 day Rule being inflexible, it is flexible if
       one considers the  days  when  any  period  of  overstaying  was  not
       accepted.

   22. The Appellant had not overstayed by a few days; he had  no  3C  leave
       since 7 July 2015 and this is exactly the situation that  s  117B(1),
       the need for effective immigration control, is designed for.  It  may
       be that the Appellant nearly met the Rules, and SS  (Congo)  referred
       to nearly missing meeting the Rules having some  relevance,  although
       SS (Congo) had been overturned. As to the  compelling  circumstances,
       the Appellant's position is that he nearly met the rules and  he  now
       seeks the exercise of discretion to remedy the  situation.  Returning
       him to Pakistan does not result in unduly harsh  consequences;  there
       is no dependency due to illness, there are  no  children.  These  are
       matters of convenience and cannot outweigh  the  public  interest  in
       immigration control.





Appellant's Response

   23. There were many cases of non-compliance where there was an attempt to
       circumvent the Rules. the key feature in this case was innocent  non-
       compliance; it  was  never  suggested  by  the  Respondent  that  the
       Appellant was attempting to circumvent the Rules. Had he flouted  the
       Rules it would be very different. In this case, the  public  interest
       in effective immigration control was reduced. There was a genuine and
       subsisting relationship between the Appellant and the Sponsor and the
       public interest in this particular case was very low.

   24. In response to question, Mr Trevelyan accepted  that  technically  Mr
       Mills was correct and that the Appellant had been without leave since
       7 July 2015.

Remaking the decision

   25. Mr Trevelyan submitted that the Appellant's position was exactly  the
       same at the date of hearing before us as it was before the First-tier
       Tribunal.

   26. The Judge's findings were not challenged and these are:

             a. The background to the appeal  as set out above at para 2.

             b. The Appellant's wife is receiving fertility treatment [24].

             c. The Appellant and his wife have  bought  a  house  together;
                that the Appellant is working and his wife is not [17].

             d. There would not be insurmountable obstacles to  family  life
                continuing in Pakistan, pursuant to the provisions  of  para
                EX1(b) of Appendix FM [16 - 18].

             e. There  would  not  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  the
                Appellant's re-integration into life in Pakistan [19].

             f. The Appellant had made a mistake in failing to pay  the  IHS
                fee with his first application [20].

             g. The Appellant is highly regarded in his community [20].

             h. The whole  decision  is  premised  on  the  basis  that  the
                relationship between the Appellant and the Sponsor is  in  a
                genuine and subsisting.  There  was  nothing  before  us  to
                suggest that it was not.

   27. The additional finding we would make on the basis of our analysis  of
       the underlying facts of the case as set out at paras 21a - c, is that
       the Appellant did have an opportunity to seek assistance and  rectify
       his mistake  from  the  date  of  receipt  of  the  letter  from  the
       Respondent on 15 May 2015 to the  date  of  rejection  of  his  first
       application on 7 July 2015. It was only after his  first  application
       was rejected that the Appellant "...did all that he reasonably could"
       [20]  to  rectify  his  mistake.  This,  unfortunately,  led   to   a
       considerable period of overstaying, which stretches from 8 July  2015
       to date.

   28. The decision is one to which the post  6  April  2015  appeal  rights
       regime applies; the only ground  of  appeal  available  is  that  the
       Respondent's decision is contrary to s 6 of the Human Rights At 1998.
       The Appellant's appeal is based on the Respondent's decision  failing
       to respect his private and family rights  (and  those  of  his  wife)
       under Article 8 ECHR. Applying the five step approach in Razgar,  the
       Judge correctly stated that as the relationship between the Appellant
       and his wife was genuine and subsisting, there would be  interference
       by a public authority  with  the  family  and  private  life  of  the
       Appellant and his partner and that the  decision  was  in  accordance
       with the law [24]. Reading across our findings of  fact  as  set  out
       above,  our  proportionality  assessment,  taking  into  account  the
       provisions of s117B is as follows:

             a. Immigration control  is  a  weighty  factor  in  the  public
                interest. Whilst the mistake the Appellant made in initially
                failing to pay his IHS fee was a genuine  mistake,  it  does
                not detract from the weight to be  accorded  to  the  public
                interest in immigration  control.  The  consequence  of  the
                mistake, and the failure  to  correct  the  mistake  at  the
                earliest  opportunity,  resulted  in  a  lengthy  period  of
                overstaying.

             b. It is in the interests of the economic wellbeing of  the  UK
                that the Appellant be able to speak English (s117B (2))  and
                that  he  be  able  establish  that   he   is   economically
                independent (s 117B (3)). It is stated by the Judge that the
                only provision that the Appellant was not able to meet under
                para 284 of the Rules was that  the  Appellant  had  "...not
                remained  in  the  UK  in  breach  of   immigration   rules,
                disregarding any period of overstaying for a  period  of  28
                days." This would suggest that it was accepted that  he  met
                the English language requirement and this would therefore be
                a neutral factor.

             c. Whilst the Appellant was working,  it  was  not  established
                that he was financially independent. If he  was  working  at
                the date of hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, he would
                now have been working for in excess of 7  months  and  there
                was no reason why evidence could not have  been  adduced  of
                his income. However,  none  was  provided  and  this  weighs
                against the Appellant.

             d. The provisions of s 117B (4) and (5)  provide  that  "little
                weight should be given" to a private life or a  relationship
                with a qualifying partner that is established  by  a  person
                when he was in the UK unlawfully or a private life which was
                established by a person when his leave was  precarious.  The
                Appellant's relationship with his  partner  was  established
                when he  had  lawful  leave,  and  we  have  not  attributed
                significant weight in favour of the public interest to  this
                factor. However, as to his private  life  (particularly  his
                standing in the community) this was strengthened at  a  time
                when his second application had been refused and he  was  an
                overstayer; his immigration status was therefore  precarious
                and we attribute some weight to this factor  in  the  public
                interest side of the balance.

             e. As to s 117B (6), there are no qualifying children.

   29. Taking into account the factors in favour of the Appellant, including
       the fact that he made a genuine mistake, that he owns property in the
       UK, that his wife is receiving fertility treatment, and his  standing
       in the community, and weighing these against the public  interest  in
       immigration control and the economic well-being of the  UK,  we  find
       the  decision  to   refuse   further   leave   to   remain   is   not
       disproportionate. There is no reliable evidence before us that making
       an  entry  clearance  application  from  abroad   would   result   in
       interference that was not proportionate; there was no interdependence
       due to ill-health or significant emotional interdependence, and there
       are no children of the family. This is not a case in which  the  only
       factor in the Respondent's side of the balance is the  public  policy
       consideration requiring that  an  application  be  made  from  abroad
       (Treebhowan); the Appellant had the opportunity, which he  failed  to
       take, of establishing that he met all the criteria  for  a  grant  of
       leave under Appendix FM and there are therefore,  legitimate  reasons
       based on public policy considerations for refusing  leave.  There  is
       nothing  to  prevent  the  Appellant  from  putting  in   a   further
       application supported by the correct evidence.

Decision

   30. We remake  the  decision  dismissing  the  Appellant's  appeal  under
       Article 8 ECHR.

Anonymity.

   31. The First-tier Tribunal made no order pursuant to  rule  45(4)(i)  of
       the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules  2005.  On  the
       facts of this case, we see no reasons to make such an order  pursuant
       to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
