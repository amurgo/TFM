                         UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE ESHUN

                                   Between

                          MR DAVID OGBENUDIA IDELE

                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms R Spio-Aidoo
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, HOPO


                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria.  His appeal against the
    respondent's decision to refuse his application for an EEA Residence
    Card was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Talbot.
2.   I find that the Judge erred in law in failing to take into account a
    bundle of documents which was sent to the Tribunal before the appeal
    was determined.  Although the documents were faxed to the court on 4
    April and received at Taylor House on 8 April 2013, they were not
    placed before the Judge when he prepared his determination on 15 April
    2013.

3.   In the circumstances, the Judge's decision cannot stand.  It is set
    aside in order to be remade by a different First-tier Judge.



DIRECTIONS

(i)  The appeal is listed for hearing at Taylor House hearing centre on 24
    September 2013.

(ii)  There will be two witnesses, the appellant and his wife.

(iii)  Time estimate - one hour 30 minutes.

(iv)  If the appellant wishes to submit further documents in addition to
    the documents he faxed to the court on 4 April 2013, they should reach
    the court 7 days before the hearing.
