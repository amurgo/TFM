For the Respondent:    Mr Mills, Senior Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Immigration History

 1. The Appellant is a male citizen of Bangladesh, whose date of birth is 7
    July 1988. His appeal against the decision of the Respondent to issue a
    decision to remove him pursuant to  the  provisions  of  s  10  of  the
    Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 was dismissed on all grounds by  First-
    tier tribunal  Judge  Talbot  in  a  determination  promulgated  on  10
    February 2014.


 2. The Appellant appealed on the basis that the Judge erred:


        a. In attaching weight to the written  record  of  the  Appellant's
           interview with the Immigration Officer when  he  and  his  three
           witnesses stated that his understanding of English was poor;


        b. At [18], in failing to give adequate reasons  for  finding  that
           the Appellant was working at  Asia  Restaurant  pursuant  to  MK
           (duty to give reasons) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 641 (IAC);


        c. Failing to state what weight he attached to the evidence of  the
           Appellant and the consistent  evidence  of  the  witnesses,  who
           confirmed that the Appellant was not wearing the same uniform as
           the other waiters;


        d. Failing to give  adequate  reasons  for  his  finding  that  the
           Respondent had discharged the burden of proof to establish  that
           he was working at Asia Restaurant. Even if  it  was  established
           that he was not a domestic worker, this did not mean that he had
           breached the conditions of his leave  by  working  at  the  Asia
           Restaurant because the two are not inextricably linked.


        e. At [23] in placing the burden  of  proof  on  the  Appellant  to
           establish that removal was disproportionate, when the burden  is
           on the Respondent to establish that  removal  is  proportionate,
           and in failing to follow the step by step approach  set  out  in
           Razgar for the determination of the Appellant's Article 8 claim.




 3. Permission to appeal was refused by the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  was
    granted on renewal to the Upper Tribunal. In granting permission, Upper
    Tribunal Judge Allen stated, "On balance it is in my view arguable that
    the judge erred in not making clear findings on the weight he  attached
    to the consistency of the evidence of the witnesses,  even  bearing  in
    mind the adverse points noted at paragraph 18, and also with regard  to
    the fact that the appellant was  differently  dressed  from  the  other
    waiters in the restaurant. There is also an arguable issue  as  to  the
    placing of the burden in respect of proportionality on  the  appellant,
    although in the end that may not be material."


 4. A Rule 24 response was submitted by the  Respondent,  in  which  it  is
    stated that the Judge, in a comprehensive determination, had considered
    all the evidence and given sufficient  reasons  for  finding  that  the
    Respondent had discharged the burden of  proof  under  the  Immigration
    Rules and, in relation to Article 8, the Judge had given reasons as  to
    why no the Appellant's appeal did not warrant consideration outside the
    Rules.


Submissions on behalf of the Appellant


 5. Mr Chowdhury essentially relied on the grounds of application,  stating
    further that additional follow-up questions had not been asked  of  the
    Appellant during the course  of  the  interview  with  the  Immigration
    Officer at the restaurant.  He  stated  that,  for  example,  when  the
    Appellant was asked 'Who asked you to work  here?'  and  the  Appellant
    responded 'My friend,' the Immigration Officer should have asked 'Which
    friend?' and then, 'Is he the employer?' Similarly, in response to  the
    third and fourth question recorded by the Judge in his determination at
    [17] if the Immigration Officer had asked follow up questions, he would
    have known that the Appellant had gone to see his cousin and  had  then
    gone to the restaurant. Mr Choudhury submitted that it was  clear  from
    the interview record that the Appellant did not understand the question
    and this was confirmed by the consistent answers of the  Appellant  and
    his three witnesses.


 6. When asked if he was saying that the  responses  of  the  Appellant  to
    questions were not appropriate, Mr Chowdhury  stated  that  when  there
    were concerns regarding the Appellant's ability to understand  English,
    there should be follow up questions. For example  in  response  to  the
    first question recorded by the Judge at  [17]  the  Appellant  was  not
    asked if the friend he was referring to was  his  employer.   Also,  he
    continued, when he was asked, 'How long are you  going  to  be  working
    here?' and the Appellant responded,  'Until  tomorrow  probably,'  this
    would have raised doubts as to whether  the  Appellant  understood  the
    question.


 7. Mr Chowdhury continued, when asked what he was going to  be  paid,  the
    Appellant said it was 'bed and board' and, if he had been asked by  the
    Immigration Officer, he would have said that he was  staying  with  his
    cousin and his cousin's husband. Furthermore, it was illogical for  him
    to go to Wales to work; he would have been out  of  pocket  it  he  had
    driven all the way to Wales to work but  was  only  receiving  bed  and
    board. As to the dress of the Appellant when  the  Immigration  Officer
    came to the  restaurant,  it  was  acknowledged  that  he  was  dressed
    differently to the other  waiters.  Mr  Chowdhury  submitted  that  the
    evidence at [17] was circumstantial.


 8. As to the Judge's comment that the failure to mention  in  the  written
    contract of employment  as  a  domestic  worker  that  free  board  was
    provided by his employer was surprising, there was  nothing  surprising
    in it because an employer is entitled to provide whatever he wished  to
    provide. He stated that an employer may decide that he wanted to pay an
    employee �6 an hour but would also give him substantial  tips  of  �50.
    The lack of reference to the latter in a contract would not matter. The
    Appellant stayed with his employer for five days a week.  At  weekends,
    he lived in his accommodation in Birmingham.


 9. As to the failure  to  provide  a  bank  statement,  payslips  or  HMRC
    records, there was no need to provide these  when  an  application  was
    made for  a  visa  as  a  domestic  worker  as  provided  in  the  visa
    application form; only two documents were required, the passport of the
    employer and the contract of employment. In the circumstances,  it  was
    highly unreasonable for the Judge to ask for  more  evidence  than  the
    Appellant needed to provide when he applied for leave.

Submissions on behalf of the Respondent


10. Mr Mills relied on the Rule 24 response. He submitted that  whilst  the
    Appellant and his witnesses gave consistent evidence, the  question  of
    the weight attached to the  consistency  of  evidence  as  between  the
    Appellant  and  his  witnesses  was  a  matter  for  the   Judge.   The
    corroborative evidence of witnesses is not due  any  particular  weight
    per se where evidence can only be weighed when considering the evidence
    in the round. They could all have been telling a lie; when they have an
    inherent interest in the outcome, there is a  motivation  to  lie.  The
    Appellant had admitted in interview that he was working;  it  was  only
    afterwards that it dawned on him that he was in trouble  and  the  only
    way out for him was to say that he did not understand. If the owner  of
    the restaurant had not supported the Appellant's account, he  could  be
    liable to a fine and prevented from sponsoring others. If his  domestic
    worker employer had not supported his account, he would have  lost  his
    domestic worker leave. They all had an interest in the outcome  of  the
    appeal and their consistent evidence may not be due much weight.


11. As to the Judge's treatment of their evidence, Mr Mills submitted  that
    the Judge had factored in the weight of their evidence at [17] and [19]
    and decided that  it  was  due  some  weight  but  that  other  factors
    outweighed it. He gave weight to the lack of documentary  evidence  and
    he was entitled to put what weight he wanted to on it. There  can  only
    be an error of law if his decision is irrational.


12. As to the interview record, Mr Mills  submitted  that  the  Judge  made
    findings of fact on the interview record. It was not obvious  from  the
    interview record, when it was looked at in the context of the  rest  of
    the interview as a whole, that additional questions  should  have  been
    put. When the Appellant was asked, 'Who asked you to  work  here?'  and
    the  Appellant  stated  'My  friend',  the  Appellant  had   previously
    referred, at p 171 of the interview record,  to  his  friend  'Shahan'.
    This may have been one of the other individuals whose details had  been
    omitted at p169 of the interview record or another  friend.  There  was
    nothing obviously illogical about the questions; on the  contrary,  the
    Appellant had supplied direct responses to direct questions.


13. Mr Chowdhury had submitted that it was illogical for the  Appellant  to
    travel to Wales to work at the weekends. However, there was no lack  of
    logic to someone working as a domestic worker from Monday to Friday and
    travelling to Wales at the weekend to work; his cousin was  married  to
    the owner of the restaurant. There  was  nothing  illogical  about  his
    cousin being short of staff at the weekend and asking the Appellant  to
    help out. The fact that the Appellant was to be provided with  bed  and
    board was  payment  in  lieu  and  that  was  sufficient  to  establish
    employment.


14. As to the dress of the Appellant being different to the other  waiters,
    the Judge had noted that he was wearing formal attire even  if  he  was
    dressed differently and this had been considered by him in the  overall
    balance.


15. In relation to the Article 8 assessment, Mr Mills  submitted  that  the
    Judge did not formally recognise the burden of proof in the  assessment
    of proportionality. However, he had followed the correct  approach.  He
    had  considered  the  application  under  the  Immigration  Rules.  The
    Appellant could not succeed under the Rules and he had  considered  the
    circumstances  and  decided  that  compelling  circumstances  were  not
    established for a consideration of the Article  8  appeal  outside  the
    Rules. If the failure to correctly  express  the  burden  of  proof  in
    relation to the proportionality exercise was an error of  law,  it  was
    not material as it could not be seriously argued that someone  who  had
    only been in the UK for a period of 4 or 5 years as a  domestic  worker
    and had no family in the UK and who worked in breach of  the  terms  of
    his visa would be entitled to succeed under Article 8. His appeal would
    have no reasonable prospect of success.


16. In reply, Mr Chowdhury submitted that it is not possible to assume that
    the witnesses were self-interested; it cannot be said  that  they  were
    lying and it was unreasonable to  make  that  inference.  There  was  a
    lengthy  cross-examination.  By  way  of  example,  he  said  that  the
    Appellant was asked the question at p 171 of the interview record, 'How
    did you get here?' He responded, 'In my car. It  is  outside.'  He  had
    explained during the hearing that he had gone to see his cousin and had
    gone to the restaurant. He was not going to earn money and the cost  of
    the journey to Wales would not be worth  it  for  bed  and  board.  The
    Immigration Officer should have asked if he understood  the  questions.
    The Appellant was a low skilled domestic worker and it was unreasonable
    to have expected him to understand the questions.


17. Following submissions, I reserved my decision. Both  Mr  Mills  and  Mr
    Chowdhury agreed that if I were to find that there was an error of law,
    because the  various  factors  were  balanced  together,  it  would  be
    necessary for there to be a rehearing of all the issues and  it  should
    be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.


Decision and reasons


18. Mr Chowdhury's submissions hang on the inability of  the  Appellant  to
    understand the questions put to him  when  he  was  interviewed  by  an
    Immigration  Officer  following  an  enforcement  visit  to  the   Asia
    Restaurant in North Wales. He submits firstly that  an  examination  of
    the interview record confirms that the Appellant could  not  understand
    the questions put to him. Secondly, that his witnesses  confirmed  that
    he could not understand English, and thirdly that he was a low  skilled
    worker and is unlikely to have understood English.


19. I do not accept that the Appellant did not understand the questions put
    to him at interview;  the  questions  were  direct  and  the  Appellant
    provided direct answers. The questions put to him were not  complicated
    or  difficult  to  understand;  there  is  nothing  within  the  record
    reproduced by the Judge at [17] which would result in  a  finding  that
    the Appellant could not understand  English.   Mr  Chowdhury  explained
    during the course of the hearing that the Appellant's cousin  had  said
    the  Appellant  could  not  understand  English  and  had  offered   to
    interpret.  The  Immigration  Officer  was  therefore  alert   to   the
    possibility  that  he  would  need  to  assess  whether  the  Appellant
    understand the questions put to him. However, when the Appellant was in
    fact questioned, the answers he gave were appropriate. If the  response
    he provided did not answer the question, the Immigration Officer  would
    have then asked the Appellant if he could  understand  what  was  being
    said to him.


20. In the interview record, the Appellant confirmed that he was working at
    the restaurant. I appreciate that the Judge did not state in terms what
    weight he placed on  the  consistent  evidence  of  the  witnesses,  an
    approach that is encouraged in  MK.  However,  a  full  reading  of  MK
    establishes that the purpose of providing reasons is that  the  parties
    to the appeal understand the reasons for the decisions  and  that  this
    may be directly or by inference [7]. It is clear from the determination
    read as a whole that the Judge did  not  accept  the  evidence  of  the
    witnesses that the Appellant did not understand English.


21. It is also stated in MK that:


         "[11]    The depth and extent of the duty  to  give  reasons  will
         inevitably vary from one case to another. The duty is  contextually
         sensitive. Thus, as the Upper Tribunal observed  in  Shizad  [2013]
         UKUT 35 (IAC), a tribunal's reasons need not be  extensive  if  its
         decision makes sense. See also R (Iran)  v  SSHD  [2005]  EWCA  Civ
         982."

22. The Judge analysed the interview record, and confirmed that on the face
    of the record it would "indicate that the questions  put  to  him  were
    understood" and that it amounted to an admission  of  employment  [17].
    There is nothing within Mr Chowdhury's submissions which would lead  me
    to conclude otherwise. His submissions  on  this  point  are  simply  a
    disagreement with the findings of the Judge. The Judge then noted  that
    the Appellant, though not in the same uniform as the other waiters, was
    in formal attire, both of which would lead to the reasonable conclusion
    that he was employed in breach of the terms of his visa.


23. As to his domestic worker employment, the Judge noted that the contract
    did not fully record  the  agreement  between  the  Appellant  and  his
    employer as to his conditions of employment. If the Appellant were only
    required to reside with his employer on a  one  off  basis  because  of
    particular circumstances, one would not necessarily  expect  it  to  be
    written into his contract of employment.  However,  accommodation  from
    Monday to Friday is not in the nature of one  off  tips  to  supplement
    income; it is a regular  commitment  which  one  would  expect  to  see
    reflected in the contract. However, this was not the  only  point  that
    was raised by the Judge; he also noted the lack of  payslips  and  HMRC
    documentations. It is not unreasonable for a Judge to expect, when  one
    claims to have been employed in the UK for a period  of  some  four  to
    five years, to have some evidence adduced of contact with HMRC for  the
    purposes of NI and income tax contributions.


24. These are the factors that the Judge balanced  against  the  consistent
    evidence of the witnesses and he decided on  balance,  that  the  other
    factors  outweighed  the  consistent  evidence  of  the  witnesses  and
    concluded "...that the Respondent has discharged the  burden  of  proof
    upon him that the Appellant was in breach  of  the  conditions  of  his
    leave as a domestic worker and that the cancellation of his  leave  was
    in accordance with the Immigration Rules"  [19].  The  matter  of  what
    weight is to be attached to evidence  is  for  the  Judge  (FK  (Kenya)
    [2010] EWCA Civ 1302 at para 23). The findings of the Judge  were  open
    to him on the evidence before him; his findings are not  irrational  or
    perverse and no arguable errors of law are disclosed.


25. In relation to Article 8, it is submitted that the  Judge  applied  the
    wrong burden of proof at [23] in stating that  the  Appellant  had  not
    established that his removal would be disproportionate.


26. I note that the Judge  has  directed  himself  properly  at  [21],  and
    confirmed that the Appellant does not meet the Immigration Rules for  a
    grant of leave under paragraph 276ADE  [22].  He  has  then  gone  onto
    consider his rights outside the Immigration Rules  and  concluded  that
    the Appellant "...May have acquired a private life in  the  UK,  having
    lived and worked here for over four years. However, he has given little
    evidence to show why his removal would constitute an interference  with
    his Article 8 rights of sufficient gravity  to  engage  his  convention
    rights" [23], which are responses to the first and second questions  in
    the five step approach in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27. It is therefore  clear
    that the Judge has followed the structured approach in Razgar and there
    is no need for him to specifically refer to it as long as it  is  clear
    that he has applied the principles set out therein. His conclusion then
    is that Article 8 rights are not engaged because the Appellant had  not
    provided sufficient evidence to confirm that an interference  would  be
    of sufficient gravity to engage such rights on the basis that he had no
    family, social  and  cultural  ties  there  in  Bangladesh  [23].  This
    conclusion is consistent with Nasim and others (Article 8) [2014]  UKUT
    00025 (IAC). Therefore, whilst it is an  error  of  law  to  place  the
    burden of proof to establish that removal is  not  disproportionate  on
    the Appellant, in the circumstances of this case, it would have made no
    material difference to the outcome of the case.


Decision

27. The decision of Judge Talbot contains no material errors of law and his
    decision must therefore stand.

Anonymity


28. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)
    of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules  2005.  No
    request has been made for an anonymity order and pursuant to Rule 14 of
    the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 I find no reason  to
    make an order.

FEE AWARD

In light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (procedure) Rules
2005 and section 12(4) (a) of the Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance Note: Fee Awards in
