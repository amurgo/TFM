                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is an appeal with the permission of  First  Tier  Judge  Farrelly
      against the decision of First Tier Tribunal Judge Callow  of  27  July
      2017 by which he refused an appeal against a refusal of a human rights
      claim in terms of s 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
      Act 2002 on the grounds stated  in  s  84(2)  of  the  Act,  that  the
      decision to refuse him entry clearance as a returning resident to  the
      UK was unlawful under s 6 of the  Human  Rights  Act  1998  read  with
      Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights ('the ECHR').


Background


   2. The Appellant is a citizen of Iran.   He was born on 25 December 1961.
        After his arrival in the UK in 2000 he was granted indefinite  leave
      to remain in 2010.  On 5 January 2011, he returned  to  Iran  to  look
      after his two sisters, one of whom died in 2011 and the other in 2015.
        After the death of his second sister he applied for entry  clearance
      to return to the UK.  However, as he had been away  from  the  UK  for
      more than two years and not lived in the UK for most of his life,  his
      application was refused by the Respondent under Rules 18(ii) and 19 of
      the Immigration Rules.   He had by that stage been out of the  UK  for
      around four years.   The Appellant appealed to the First Tier Tribunal
      but his appeal was dismissed on 1st September 2016.  An appeal to  the
      Upper Tribunal succeeded and the matter was remitted to the First Tier
      Tribunal for consideration of the  Appellant's  human  rights  grounds
      which, the Upper Tribunal held, the First Tier  Tribunal  had  wrongly
      failed to consider.  That remittal led to the decision of  First  Tier
      Tribunal Judge Callow which is now appealed to us.


   3. The judge below set out the relevant factual background to  the  issue
      arising on this appeal at para 4 of his judgment, which we  summarise.
      The Appellant has a son called Reza, who lives  in  the  UK.   He  has
      indefinite leave to remain. Reza was  born  in  1986.    The  evidence
      established that Reza has the mental age of  a  9  year  old.   He  is
      schizophrenic, has  a  severe  learning  disability  and  is  visually
      impaired.   He is a vulnerable adult in need of care.     Prior to his
      departure for Iran, that care was provided by the Appellant  with  the
      assistance of his two other adult two children Bob Brown  (aka  Pejman
      Azimi) and Parisa Azimi.  They continued  to  care  for  Reza  in  the
      Appellant's absence.


   4. The Appellant wishes  to  return  to  the  UK  to  care  for  Reza  in
      circumstances where his other two children are unable  any  longer  to
      care for Reza.   Mr Brown now has children of his own,  who  no  doubt
      place great demands on him, and Ms Parisi was engaged to be married in
      September 2017.  The judge below recorded that whilst  her  fiancï¿½  is
      supportive of her caring role, she wishes to move on with her own life
      without the day to day responsibility  of  looking  after  Reza.    He
      lives in council accommodation and receives public funds for  everyday
      living.   Without any carer, he would have to be provided with one, or
      be placed in sheltered accommodation. The judge noted that  the  costs
      to the state if the Appellant were allowed to return would be  reduced
      if the Appellant cared for Reza,  although  he  also  noted  that  the
      Appellant would not be financially independent.  The judge  also  said
      there was no evidence of the Appellant's command of English.


   5. The Appellant's argument, in summary, was  that  a  refusal  of  entry
      clearance was a disproportionate  interference  with  his  and  Reza's
      private life in contravention of Article 8 of the ECHR.


   6. The judge accepted that the decision to refuse entry clearance engaged
      Article 8 (paras 9 and 10).   He also accepted that the Appellant  was
      'irreplaceable' as Reza's carer 'in  the  broader,  more  nuanced  and
      emotional sense'  in  which  that  term  was  interpreted  in  Lama  v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2017]  UKUT  00016  (IAC)
      (para 12).  He also accepted (para 13) that there was no evidence from
      the Respondent about what, precisely, the state would provide for Reza
      by way of enhanced state-funded care if his father could not return to
      look after him.


   7. The judge then turned to s 117B of the Immigration Act 2014.  He  said
      that the public interest in the maintenance of  effective  immigration
      controls was engaged (s 117B(1)); he said that it had not  been  shown
      the Appellant is a capable English speaker (s 117B(2)); he  said  that
      the Appellant was not financially independent (s 117B(3)); at the time
      of his departure for Iran he had indefinite leave to remain and so his
      position was not  precarious  (s  117B(4)  and  (5)).     The  judge's
      conclusion was at para 15:


             "Balancing all facts identified in  this  appeal,  I  conclude
             that the respondent's refusal to grant  entry  clearance  does
             not interfere  disproportionately  with  the  appellant's  and
             Reza's rights guaranteed under Article 8.  The public interest
             pitted against the appellant in circumstances where it has not
             been established that he able to speak English and that he  is
             financially independent, outweighs  all  positive  factors  of
             weight  showing  the   existence   of   family   life.     The
             circumstances are such that it cannot be said that the  public
             interest bearing the imprimatur of  parliamentary  endorsement
             must yield on the facts established in this case."


    8. Accordingly, he dismissed the appeal.


Grounds of challenge


   9. On behalf of  the  Appellant,  Mr  Hodson  submits  that  the  judge's
      decision was erroneous on a point of law in that

       a. there were inadequate reasons given for the  decision.    He  says
          that the paragraph we have quoted is conclusory in nature and does
          not begin adequately to set out why he reaches the  conclusion  he
          did.   He says that in particular it is impossible  to  understand
          what  weight  or  importance  has  been  given  to  those  factors
          surrounding the 'irreplaceable' nature of the  Appellant  to  care
          for his severely disabled son.


       b. Linked to the first ground of appeal, he also says that there  was
          a failure by the judge in assessing  proportionality  to  consider
          the impact on other family members besides the Appellant.


       c. He also says that s 117B was misapplied.   For  example,  he  says
          that as someone who had lived in the UK for 11 years prior to  his
          departure the Appellant was already integrated into society (see s
          117B(2)).


Discussion

  10. We allowed the appeal essentially  for  the  reasons  advanced  by  Mr
      Hodson.


  11. The judge rightly recognised that the  question  which  arose  on  the
      appeal  was  whether  the   refusal   of   entry   clearance   was   a
      disproportionate interference with the right to a private  and  family
      life under Article 8 of the ECHR of, first and foremost, the Appellant
      and Reza.   The question for us is whether  the  judge  correctly  and
      lawfully carried out that proportionality assessment.    Having  heard
      oral submissions we were quite clear that the judge  fell  into  error
      and that the decision had to be set aside and remade.


  12. The judge was under a duty to give a judgment. Where there is  a  duty
      to give reasons, the reasons must be adequate.  As noted in de  Smith,
      Judicial Review (7th Edn), at para 7-102, it  is  difficult  to  state
      precisely the standard of reasoning the court will demand  when  asked
      to scrutinize the adequacy of reasons  given.   The  reasons  must  be
      intelligible and must meet the substance of  the  arguments  advanced.
      In a passage which is often  cited  (see  eg  Ogango  v.  Nursing  and
      Midwifery Council [2008] EWHC 3115 (Admin), para 23), the  editors  of
      de Smith say at para 7 - 102:


             "In short, the  reasons  must  show  that  the  decision-maker
             successfully came to grips with the main contentions  advanced
             by the parties, and must tell the parties in broad  terms  why
             they have lost or, as the case may be, won."


  13. Furthermore, reasons must not disclose  errors  of  reasoning.  As  de
      Smith says at para 7-107 (citations omitted):


             "Where reasons are  required  ...  They  must  therefore  both
             rationally  relate  to  the  evidence  in  the  case,  and  be
             comprehensible in themselves ...  a  decision  may  be  struck
             down  where  an  applicant  can  show  substantial   prejudice
             resulting from a failure on the part of the decision  -  maker
             to demonstrate how an issue of law  had  been  resolved  or  a
             disputed issue of fact  decided,  or  by  'demonstrating  some
             other lack of reasoning which raised substantial  doubts  over
             the decision-making process' or by  indicating  'the  tribunal
             had never properly considered the  matter  ...  and  that  the
             proper thought processes have not been gone through.'"

  14. In our judgment Mr Hodson was right when he said  no,  or  no  legally
      adequate, reasons were given for the judge's ruling.  We  respectfully
      take the view that para 15, which we have quoted above, was conclusory
      and not reasoned, and that it did not articulate in a proper  way  how
      the judge reached the decision that he did.  We would have expected  a
      checklist of factors for and against allowing entry clearance to  have
      been identified, together with an assessment of what weight the  judge
      was ascribing to each having regard to the overall facts of the  case,
      and then an explanation of why the judge was reaching  the  conclusion
      that he was.    Simply saying, as the  judge  did,  that  the  factors
      against return "outweigh[ed] all positive factors  of  weight  showing
      the existence of family life" was, in  our  respectful  judgment,  not
      good enough.     The judge needed specifically to identify  and  weigh
      those positive  factors  individually.    There  were,  in  our  view,
      particularly strong  grounds  in  this  case  weighing  in  favour  of
      allowing return outside the Rules, given the Appellant's status as the
      'irreplaceable' carer of a severely disabled and vulnerable  man  with
      no other family members able to care for him in the manner they  would
      wish.  Whilst the judge  did  identify  this  factor  earlier  in  his
      judgment, it did not specifically feature in  the  weighing  calculus,
      and it should have done.


  15. Furthermore, it was not the  correct  approach  simply  to  treat  the
      factors in s 117B as factors of great weight, without considering  how
      that weight might be affected by the particular  facts  of  the  case.
      Take the question of English language ability.  The rationale given by
      Parliament in s 117B(2) for the inclusion of that factor in the public
      interest assessment is that those who speak English are better able to
      integrate into society.  But whatever  the  Appellant's  knowledge  of
      English (and given he lived here for 11 years we expect he would  know
      some at least) he is or was already integrated into  English  society.
      It was for the judge to recognise and take account of this  fact,  but
      he did not do so.   Similarly with regard to  financial  independence.
        If the Appellant were allowed to return then there would,  in  part,
      be less of a burden on the state because  otherwise  the  state  would
      have to replace the care which Reza's brother and sister are no longer
      able to provide.   Hence this factor did not have as much purchase  in
      this case as it might otherwise  do.    Again,  the  judge  failed  to
      recognise or take account of this in his reasons.


  16. We are bound to say that the judge's conclusion at  the  end  came  as
      something of a surprise given the findings that he made earlier in the
      judgment.


  17. It was for these reasons that we set aside the judge's decision.   The
      parties invited us to remake  the  decision  which  we  did.   We  are
      satisfied that the compassionate circumstances of this case show  that
      there are additional elements of dependency between the appellant  and
      his adult child that engage the operation of Article 8.  Although  the
      appellant failed to meet the strict requirements  of  the  immigration
      rules we give weight to the fact that previously he was settled in the
      UK and that there were compassionate circumstances to explain  why  he
      was unable to return to the UK within the two-year period required  by
      the rules. Paragraph 19 of the  rules  allows  for  discretion  to  be
      exercised in appropriate cases. The First-tier  Tribunal  judge  found
      that the nature and the level of care provided by  the  appellant  was
      irreplaceable. We take into account the fact  that  the  appellant  is
      Reza's primary carer and that his continued absence is likely to  have
      an adverse impact on a vulnerable adult with severe  disabilities.  We
      have also had regard to the impact that the decision has  had  on  the
      appellant's other adult children, who have had to place their lives on
      hold to care for Reza in his absence. We have  already  explained  why
      the general public interest considerations such  as  English  language
      and financial independence are not weighty factors  on  the  facts  of
      this case. Having weighed all the circumstances we have no  hesitation
      in concluding that  the  decision  to  refuse  entry  clearance  as  a
      returning resident does not strike a fair balance  and  amounts  to  a
      disproportionate interference with appellant's rights under Article 8.

DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making of an error on a  point
    of law

The decision is remade and the appeal ALLOWED on human rights grounds
