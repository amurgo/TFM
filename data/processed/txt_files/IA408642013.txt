Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Pretzell, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Miss J Isherwood, HOPO


                   DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW AND DIRECTIONS


1.   The appellant appeals with leave against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  Hawden-Beal  who  dismissed  her  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent to issue directions under Section 47 of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 and  to  refuse  to  grant
    further leave to remain outside the Immigration Rules under  paragraphs
    276ADE and Appendix FM of HC 395 as amended and under Article 8 of  the
    Human Rights Convention.  The respondent's  decision  was  made  on  18
    September 2013

2.   On 24 September 2011 the appellant was granted limited leave  to  enter
    the UK until 19 December 2012 as a Tier 4 student.  On 11 December 2012
    an application was made on the appellant's behalf for leave  to  remain
    on the basis of her family and private life in the UK.  The  respondent
    refused the application  because  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirement  of  the  family  and  private  life  provisions   of   the
    Immigration Rules.  She was not married to her sponsor and they had not
    been  living  together  for  two  years  preceding  the  date  of   the
    application.

3.   At paragraph 11 of the determination, the judge noted  the  appellant's
    evidence that as at the date of the hearing on 4 April  2014,  she  had
    been married to her now husband and then partner for one month and  one
    day.  The judge said at paragraph 6 that by virtue of Section 85(4)  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 she could consider any
    evidence which she considered to be relevant to the  substance  of  the
    matter, including postdecision evidence.   In  in-country  appeals  she
    could also take account of evidence right up to the date of the hearing
    as per the case of LS Gambia [2005] UKAIT 0085.  However, at  paragraph
    16 the judge held that the appellant could not meet the requirements of
    Appendix FM in relation to her family life, firstly, because,  although
    since the date of the refusal, the appellant has married  her  partner,
    she did not make this application for  leave  to  remain  as  either  a
    partner or fianc�e as per Section R-LTRP1.1. Secondly,  she  could  not
    meet the financial requirements of Appendix FM because her partner only
    earned �9,160.32 in the six months prior to the date of the application
    when he required �9,300.

4.   I find that the judge's findings at paragraph 16 were contrary  to  her
    assertion at paragraph 6 that she  could  take  post-decision  evidence
    that was relevant to the substance of the issue that  was  before  her.
    The judge's failure to consider the appellant's marriage in the context
    of the family and private life provisions of the Immigration Rules  was
    an error of law.

5.   Section EX of Appendix FM states that this  paragraph  applies  if  the
    applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a partner  who
    is in the UK and is a British citizen, settled in the UK.   Given  that
    the appellant was  now  married  to  her  partner  the  judge  was  not
    precluded from considering EX.1(b).  In light of  the  evidence  before
    her  the  judge  was  required  to  look  at  whether  the  appellant's
    circumstances complied with the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules
    and, as Gulshan said, it is only if there may be arguably good  grounds
    for granting leave to remain outside then is it necessary for Article 8
    purposes  to  go  on  to  consider   whether   there   are   compelling
    circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them.

6.   I find that the judge materially erred in law in  failing  to  consider
    the appellant's circumstances as presented to her at the hearing within
    the fabric of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

7.   The judge's decision cannot stand.  It is set  aside  in  order  to  be
    remade.
