                            DECISION AND REASONS

Representation:

For the appellant:     No appearance or representation
For the respondent:    Ms Alexandra Everett, a Senior Home Office
Presenting Officer

Anonymity order

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) The Tribunal has ORDERED that no one shall publish  or  reveal
the name or address of S A who  is  the  subject  of  these  proceedings  or
publish or reveal any information which would  be  likely  to  lead  to  the
identification of her or of any member of  her  family  in  connection  with
these proceedings.

Any failure to comply with this direction could give  rise  to  contempt  of
court proceedings.

Decision and reasons

 1. The appellant appeals with permission from the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing her appeal against the  respondent's  decision
    on 18 July 2020 to refuse her entry clearance on human  rights  grounds
    to join her spouse in the United Kingdom.  The appellant is  a  citizen
    of Bangladesh.  Her son, born in 2011 and a British citizen, lives with
    the appellant in Bangladesh and is her dependant in this appeal.

 2. Mode of hearing.  This error of law hearing was heard remotely by Skype
    for Business, both the appellant's former solicitors and the respondent
    having indicated that they did not object to a remote hearing.

 3. Notice of hearing.  The appellant was  until  recently  represented  by
    Cartwright King solicitors, and her grounds of appeal were  drafted  by
    Counsel (Ms Emma  Rotherfield).   However,  following  service  of  the
    notice of hearing, on 12 February 2021, Cartwright  King  informed  the
    Upper Tribunal that their retainer had terminated: they gave no further
    details, simply asking for correspondence to be forwarded  directly  to
    the appellant from that date.

 4. I have checked the notice of hearing: it was served both on  Cartwright
    King and on the sponsor (the appellant's husband)  at  his  address  in
    Telford.   I am satisfied that the appellant is aware of  this  hearing
    but neither she,  nor  the  sponsor,  arranged  to  attend  it  or  for
    representation.

 5. That would appear to indicate either that she is no  longer  interested
    in this application, or perhaps that she has taken up the suggestion in
    the  First-tier  Judge's  decision  that  she  should  make   a   fresh
    application.

 6. In the circumstances, I considered it appropriate to proceed  with  the
    error of law hearing in the absence of the appellant and sponsor.

Background

 7. The appellant's spouse is settled here.  The appellant's child, a nine-
    year-old British citizen at the date of hearing, was born in  2011  and
    lives with his mother in Bangladesh.  The boy, being British,  has  the
    right  to  live  in  the  United  Kingdom  but  the  parties'   current
    arrangement is for him to remain with his mother in Bangladesh.

 8. The appellant has made three previous applications for entry clearance,
    in 2011, 2013, and (from the Republic of Ireland) in  2017.   All  were
    unsuccessful.  In answer to a question on  her  Visa  Application  Form
    (VAF) about refusal of a visa for any country, she disclosed  the  2011
    and 2013 refusals but not the 9 March 2017 refusal of  her  application
    made at the United Kingdom's Visa Application Centre in the Republic of
    Ireland.

 9. The respondent's refusal letter noted that the appellant  had  produced
    all of the specified documents for Category A of her VAF, but that  the
    sponsor's payslips, when converted to an annual figure,  showed  income
    of only �17104.06, although the minimum  income  threshold  is  �18600.
    The sponsor  did  not  have  sufficient  savings  to  qualify  by  that
    alternative route.

10. The respondent refused entry clearance both on suitability  and  income
    grounds.  the appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

First-tier Tribunal decision

11. The First-tier Judge considered  that  omitting  mention  of  the  2017
    application made in the Republic of Ireland was an honest  mistake  and
    did not find that it made the appellant unsuitable for entry clearance.

12. The appellant's Counsel conceded at  the  hearing  that  the  appellant
    could not meet the financial requirements of the Rules: see [18] in the
    First-tier Tribunal decision.

13. The appeal therefore turned  on  Article  8  ECHR  outside  the  Rules.
    Documents were produced for the hearing, which the respondent  had  not
    had the opportunity of verifying, indicating that the sponsor  now  had
    two jobs and his income was above �18600.  That does not invalidate the
    assessment that at the  date  of  application,  or  even  the  date  of
    decision, his income was too low:  instead,  as  the  First-tier  Judge
    rightly identified, it means that the appellant and her son  could  now
    make an application which, if the payslips  and  so  on  were  genuine,
    would succeed.

14. The judge took account of that possibility, and also that  it  remained
    open to the sponsor to go to Bangladesh and  live  with  his  wife  and
    small son there.  The sponsor is of Bangladeshi origin, although he  is
    now a British citizen.

15. The core of the First-tier Judge's reasoning is at [19]-[20] and  [26]-
    31] of his decision.  At [32], the judge found that the  appellant  did
    not fail the suitability criteria,  but  that  she  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules or succeed under Article 8 ECHR.

16. The appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal.

Permission to appeal

17. Upper Tribunal Judge Norton-Taylor granted permission to appeal on  two
    grounds: first, that the  specified  evidence  appeared  to  have  been
    provided but that the judge had not made  a  finding  on  the  evidence
    before him as  to  the  satisfaction  or  otherwise  of  the  financial
    requirements; and second, that the judge  had  arguably  erred  in  his
    application of the exceptional circumstances argument.

Rule 24 Reply

18. On 15 October 2020, considerably out of time, the respondent  made  her
    Rule 24 Reply.  The core of her submission was this:

         "3.  The respondent submits that it was accepted that the appellant
         could not meet the financial requirements of the Immigration  Rules
         at the date of application. Although the sponsor claimed  that  his
         income met the income threshold by the date of hearing,  the  Judge
         of the First-tier Tribunal gave adequate reasons  for  finding  the
         evidence before him was  insufficient  to  be  satisfied  that  the
         requirements of the Rules are met.   The  respondent  submits  that
         there was no error in finding that the if the sponsor could produce
         evidence  to  demonstrate  that  his  income  now  met  the  income
         threshold,  this  evidence  could  be  used  to  support  a   fresh
         application for entry clearance.

         4.   The respondent  submits  that  the  judge  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal gave adequate reasons for finding that the delay caused by
         requiring  a  fresh  application  would  amount  to  only   limited
         interference and that there were  no  exceptional  or  sufficiently
         compelling circumstances to justify allowing the appeal on  Article
         8 grounds. ..."

19. No point has been taken on the timeliness of the respondent's Reply.

20. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Analysis

21. At the hearing today, in the absence of any appearance by or on  behalf
    of the appellant, Ms Everett relied on the refusal letter and the  Rule
    24 Reply.

22. I reserved my decision which I now give.

23. As regards the challenge to the  judge's  finding  that  the  appellant
    could not meet the requirements of the Rules on financial grounds, this
    is unarguable because the appellant's Counsel conceded  that  point  at
    the First-tier Tribunal hearing.

24. The additional job which the sponsor husband claims to have taken on is
    one in which he is paid in cash for working in a restaurant.  The judge
    did consider the documents the sponsor produced at  [28]  and  observed
    that:

         "28. ...There are issues concerning the wage slips from the  second
         job working in a restaurant.  The sponsor said that he is  paid  in
         cash.  His employer produced a letter confirming that.  Some of the
         wage slips referred to BACS payments.

         29.  Documentation  has  been  provided  concerning  the  sponsor's
         income but I do not have the means of confirming the validity  that
         the respondent has [available to her].  If the sponsor is  able  to
         establish that his  income  is  as  claimed,  the  appellant  would
         succeed in a new application. ..."

25. It is not right to say that the judge  overlooked  the  copy  documents
    produced.  His  reasons  are  proper,  intelligible,  and  adequate  to
    support the conclusion that this is not a Chikwamba situation where the
    documents produced are so obviously genuine  that  there  is  no  point
    making the appellant apply again.

26. In relation to Article 8 generally, the appellant contends  that  there
    are  exceptional  circumstances,  primarily  the  willingness  of   the
    sponsor's mother to support him, and the best interests of  the  child.
    The  appellant  contends  that  the  judge  did  not  engage  with  the
    appellant's case and that his reasoning is inadequate.  The  First-tier
    Judge did find that it would be in the child's best interests  to  live
    with both parents, but section  55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act 2009 does not apply to him while he remains outside the
    United Kingdom.  It is a matter for his parents where he lives.

27. The First-tier Judge did not err in concluding that there  was  nothing
    exceptional in  the  circumstances  of  this  family  for  which  entry
    clearance should be given outside the Immigration Rules.

28. This appeal is dismissed.

DECISION

29. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:


    The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error  on
    a point of law


    I do not set aside the decision but order that it shall stand.
