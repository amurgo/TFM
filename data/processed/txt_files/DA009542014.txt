For the Appellant:     Ms G Thomas, Counsel instructed by Irving & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Brocklesby-Weller, Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal comes before  me  following  the  dismissal  by  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  Cockrill  of  the  appellant's  appeal   against   the
    respondent's decision to make a deportation order.

 2. The deportation order was made pursuant to  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the EEA Regulations")  following  the
    appellant's conviction for an offence of controlling  prostitution  for
    gain for which she received a sentence of 12 months' imprisonment on  9
    December 2013.

 3. The  circumstances  of  the  offence  as  set  out  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's determination and in the sentencing remarks, are as follows.
     The appellant's partner was the "prime  mover"  at  the  centre  of  a
    criminal enterprise over a period of  five  years  whereby  women  were
    recruited to work as prostitutes.  He  controlled  a  number  of  small
    flats in London where the women worked; five flats in total.   Although
    none of the women were forced to work as  prostitutes,  the  system  of
    having "profiles" which were not their own meant that they  were  often
    required to offer services to the clients which they did  not  in  fact
    offer. They were required to pay a penalty to the  appellant's  partner
    if as a result of failing to provide those services a client left.

 4. The evidence was that the appellant's partner would frequently  attempt
    to persuade the women to take on more risky types of  work  which  were
    more lucrative.  Two  of  the  women  contracted  sexually  transmitted
    diseases during the course of the work.  The judge concluded that there
    was a degree  of  mental  and  economic,  if  not  physical,  coercion.
    �25,000 in cash was found at one of the flats.  In addition, 120 mobile
    phones were seized.  The sentencing judge described it as a large-scale
    planned operation.  The judge concluded that the rough sum made over  a
    period of year was in the region of �430,000, of which the  appellant's
    partner would have received roughly half.

 5. The appellant's partner received a sentence of 33 months'  imprisonment
    with a consecutive sentence of seven months' imprisonment for doing  an
    act tending to pervert the course of justice.

 6. So far as the appellant is concerned, she was assessed as having played
    a lesser role but was nevertheless a  willing  participant.   She  took
    photographs for the profiles, answered the phones and collected  money.
    On one occasion she threatened one of the women with violence when  she
    attempted to leave.  The sentencing judge stated that the appellant had
    had an active role in the hierarchy of authority, and was next in  line
    to her partner.  She also benefited from the proceeds of the crime.

    The First-tier judge's determination

 7. Judge Cockrill found that the  appellant  had  not  acquired  permanent
    residence in the UK and that she was therefore  only  entitled  to  the
    lowest level of protection, namely on the  grounds  of  public  policy,
    public security or public health.

 8. He concluded at [126] that the appellant was someone who showed  little
    appreciation and understanding of the plight  of  the  women  who  were
    working for them, adopting a "cold and cynical attitude" towards  their
    situation.  In the next paragraph he concluded that she  had  tried  to
    play down her involvement but the reality was that she did benefit from
    the financial operation.  At [131] the  judge  said  that  he  was  not
    persuaded that the appellant had really "turned over a new  leaf".   He
    referred to the OASys  Report  which  stated  that  there  remained  an
    appreciable risk of the appellant reoffending if she sees the  prospect
    of poverty looming.  The essential picture  of  her  offending,  having
    been to make money, no  matter  at  what  cost,  had  not  altered,  he
    concluded.

 9. In relation to the appellant's child  E,  it  was  noted  that  it  was
    envisaged that E would return to Poland with his mother.  It  was  also
    noted that E has behavioural difficulties and was considered to  be  on
    the autistic spectrum, although  there  was  at  that  time  no  formal
    diagnosis of autism.  He concluded at [136] that "although  there  will
    be some disruption" to E by going to Poland with his mother, he can  be
    perfectly well cared for by the appellant in Poland, where she would be
    able  to  gain  appropriate  help  and  support  through   the   Polish
    educational system.  At [140] the judge found the welfare of E is  best
    served by remaining with his mother, who would be returned to Poland.

10. It was concluded that there had been a "measure  of  integration"  into
    the UK simply through the passage of time that the appellant  had  been
    in the UK (she arrived  in  January  2004).   It  was  noted  that  the
    appellant did undertake a course in prison but  the  judge  found  that
    that did not show that she had expressed remorse [126].  The  appellant
    had meaningful ties with Poland, her mother being  there;  although  it
    was accepted that she does not enjoy a particularly close bond with her
    sibling.

11. Returning to the issue of risk of reoffending, at [149] the judge found
    that the appellant does represent a genuine, present  and  sufficiently
    serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society.

    The grounds of appeal and submissions

12. There are three grounds of appeal.  The first contends that  the  judge
    did not undertake an assessment of the appellant's  relative  prospects
    of rehabilitation in the UK and in Poland.  The  second  ground  argues
    that the judge failed to give primacy to  the  best  interests  of  the
    appellant's child.  The third ground alleges a failure to give  reasons
    for rejecting the expert evidence in relation to the child.

13. In submissions, Ms Thomas took grounds 1 and 3 first.  As  set  out  in
    the grounds, ground 1 relies on the decision in R (on  the  application
    of) Daha Essa v Upper Tribunal (Immigration & Asylum Chamber)  and  anr
    [2012] EWCA Civ 1718.  Although the judge  had  at  [54]  set  out  the
    principle to be derived from Essa and had cited that authority, he  had
    failed to go on to apply it to the facts of the appeal before him.  The
    judge was required to assess whether removing her from  her  employment
    was conducive to her rehabilitation.  In addition, there  was  evidence
    that the appellant had approached the Koestler Trust  with  a  view  to
    benefiting from mentoring,  and  that  she  was  aware  of  sources  of
    professional support (according to her grounds of  appeal,  drafted  by
    her).

14. In relation to ground 3, there was evidence from an independent  social
    worker and from a consultant psychologist in terms of  the  significant
    adverse effect on E were he to be removed from  the  UK.   The  judge's
    conclusion that there would be "some  disruption"  to  E  by  going  to
    Poland with the appellant was not an adequate characterisation  of  the
    evidence before him.

15. In relation to ground 2, the  judge  said  at  [140]  that  the  proper
    decision  is  for  the  appellant  to  be  returned  to   Poland   "and
    consequently" the welfare of E is best served  by  remaining  with  his
    mother.  It is argued that this betrays an approach whereby a  decision
    had first  been  taken  as  to  the  desirability  of  the  appellant's
    deportation with E's best interests addressed as a secondary matter.

16. In submissions Ms Thomas relied on the grounds of appeal.  In  relation
    to ground 1, I was referred to the more recent decision of the Court of
    Appeal in Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  v  Dumliauskas,
    Woznik, and ME [2015] EWCA Civ 145. At [48] of that decision the  court
    concluded that it is not the case that the prospects of  rehabilitation
    are irrelevant unless the offender has a permanent right of  residence,
    although it was also said at [54] that in the case of an offender  with
    no permanent right of residence substantial weight would not  be  given
    to rehabilitation.

17. Although it might be submitted on behalf of the  respondent   that  any
    error of law in this respect by the judge was therefore immaterial,  in
    the light of what was said in Dumliauskas, the appeal before the First-
    tier Tribunal was a finely balanced  one.   The  appellant  received  a
    sentence of 12 months' imprisonment which was only just on the cusp  of
    the deportation threshold.  Ms Thomas informed me that that  submission
    was made on the basis of the respondent's guidance  on  deportation  in
    EEA cases, albeit that no copy of any such guidance was put before me.

18. It was submitted that the Probation Service  assessment  was  that  the
    risk  of  the  appellant  reoffending  was  low.   Although  the  judge
    concluded  otherwise,  he  had  failed  to  consider   the   issue   of
    rehabilitation.  The OASys Report indicated that the appellant was very
    motivated to change.  Similarly, the impact of deportation on E  was  a
    further factor which indicated that the case was  finely  balanced  and
    could go either way.  Therefore, it could not be said that the  outcome
    could not have been any different.

19. So far as ground 3 is concerned, I was referred to the  reports  of  Ms
    Phillipa Williams,  a  consultant  psychologist,  and  that  of  Robert
    Simpson, an independent social worker.  It was submitted that the  gist
    of those reports indicated that  the  appellant's  son  has  particular
    difficulty adapting to change.  At the time of the hearing  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal the evidence was that he  had  an  autism  spectrum
    disorder.  The impact on E of his  having  to  leave  the  UK,  on  the
    evidence,  would  therefore  be  considerably  beyond  what  the  judge
    described as "some disruption".  The inference to be  drawn  from  this
    aspect of the determination is that the judge rejected the evidence  of
    those professional witnesses but did not give reasons for doing so.

20.  As  regards  ground  2,  it  was  submitted  with  reference  to   the
    determination that the best interests consideration was  undertaken  as
    an adjunct to the conclusion that the  appellant  should  be  deported.
    The  judge  referred  to  E's  best  interests  at  the  end   of   the
    determination at [155].  Prior to that there was no  proper  assessment
    of that issue.

21. Ms Brocklesby-Weller relied on the  respondent's  'rule  24'  response.
    There was no challenge to the assessment that the appellant represented
    a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the
    fundamental interests of society.  I was referred to various paragraphs
    of the determination in relation  to  the  judge's  assessment  of  the
    appellant's risk of reoffending.

22. The fact that the appellant had  undertaken  a  course  in  prison  was
    referred  to  by  the  judge  at  [126].   Although  the  reference  to
    rehabilitation was  brief,  unless  the  appellant  had  addressed  her
    offending behaviour the issue of rehabilitation would not  assist  her.
    This is particularly so bearing in  mind  that  she  does  not  have  a
    permanent right of residence.  In that context the decision in MC (Essa
    principles recast) Portugal [2015] UKUT 00520 (IAC) was relied on.

23. It was submitted  that  the  judge  did  take  into  account  E's  best
    interests and there was a synopsis of the evidence of the  psychologist
    and the  independent  social  worker.   The  judge  was  alert  to  the
    disruption that there would be to E on leaving the UK and returning  to
    Poland with his mother.

24. In reply, Ms Thomas reiterated that the  issue  of  rehabilitation  was
    important in this case, particularly bearing in  mind  what  the  judge
    said about the appellant's risk of reoffending in  circumstances  where
    she might find herself in  poverty.   There  was  evidence  before  the
    Tribunal of the steps that the appellant had been taking to address her
    offending.   That  was  not  factored   into   the   consideration   of
    rehabilitation.

25. So far as E is concerned, it is not simply the case that  he  would  be
    removed from the educational system in the UK as had been submitted  on
    behalf of the respondent  in submissions, but he would  be  taken  away
    from the specialised support that he is receiving, as revealed  by  the
    evidence before the First-tier Judge.

    My assessment

26. As regards ground 1, it is clear  from  authority  that  the  issue  of
    rehabilitation is a factor to be taken into account in  the  assessment
    of proportionality.

27. Ms Thomas relied in part on the OASys assessment which stated that  the
    appellant is very motivated to address offending.  I also note that  it
    says on page 32 of the OASys assessment  that  the  appellant  is  very
    capable of changing and  reducing  offending.   The  grounds  refer  to
    evidence that the appellant had approached the Koestler  Trust  with  a
    view to benefiting from mentoring.   The  grounds  also  refer  to  the
    appellant's own manuscript grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal
    which it is said suggest that she is aware of sources  of  professional
    support.  I note from those grounds that the appellant referred to what
    is described as the "Sycamore  Tree  programme",  which  the  appellant
    stated that she had applied for.  She referred to  assistance  she  has
    sought in obtaining employment and to her being active in the education
    department (presumably in prison), referring to  the  courses  she  has
    undertaken.

28. In his determination at [53]-[54] the judge referred to the decision in
    Essa and its principle.  At [68] he referred, amongst other things,  to
    various certificates that the appellant had obtained, and miscellaneous
    educational qualifications.   At  [69]  he  stated  that  he  had  been
    provided with a copy of the decision in Essa  "to  which  I  have  made
    earlier reference".

29. Those parts of the determination  are  not  within  the  "findings  and
    reasons" section but are indicative of the  judge's  awareness  of  the
    issue of rehabilitation.  At [126] he stated that he was aware that the
    appellant had undertaken the course in prison but concluded  that  that
    did not necessarily mean that she had expressed remorse.  In  the  same
    paragraph he went on to express his view that the appellant was someone
    who showed little appreciation and understanding of the plight  of  the
    prostitutes who were working for them, and that she adopted what  could
    only be  described  as  a  cold  and  cynical  attitude  towards  their
    situation.  He went on to refer to the appellant  as  having  tried  to
    play down her involvement.

30. It seems to  me  that  it  can  legitimately  be  said  that  in  those
    paragraphs the judge was commenting on the appellant's attitude to  her
    offending which in fact  militated  against  any  conclusion  that  the
    appellant would be, or has been, engaging in any  rehabilitative  work.
    In subsequent paragraphs, after  further  comment  on  the  appellant's
    attitude to her offence, the judge  stated  at  [133]  that  the  whole
    pattern of offending was to make money, no matter at what cost  and  he
    concluded that as far as he could see "that essential picture  has  not
    altered." In those circumstances, it is difficult to see what realistic
    part  any  question  of  rehabilitation  could  have  to  play  in  the
    proportionality assessment, on the facts this appeal.

31. I do consider that the determination would  have  benefited  from  some
    express identification of the evidence relied on by the appellant going
    to the issue of rehabilitation.  However, I am not satisfied  that  the
    judge erred in law in not having done so.  The judge did refer at [144]
    to the appellant having had some measure of integration simply  through
    the passage of time that she has been here but he then went on to refer
    to the ties that she has with Poland.

32. Even if it could be said that the judge erred  in  law  in  failing  to
    undertake a clearer articulation of the issue of rehabilitation,  I  am
    not satisfied that this amounts  to  an  error  of  law  requiring  the
    decision to be set aside.  I bear in mind what  was  said  at  [54]  in
    Dumliauskas as follows:

         "Lastly, in agreement with what was said by the Upper  Tribunal  in
         Vasconcelos, I do not consider that in the case of an offender with
         no permanent right of residence substantial weight should be  given
         to rehabilitation."

33. It is to be remembered in this  case  that  there  is  an  unchallenged
    finding that the appellant had not acquired permanent  residence.   The
    point made at [54] of Dumliauskas was reiterated in the decision in MC.

34. Grounds 2 and 3 can be taken together.  I do not accept that the First-
    tier Judge  failed  to  give  appropriate  consideration  to  E's  best
    interests or that he failed to have regard to, or minimised, the expert
    evidence.

35. So far as the expert evidence is concerned, at [70] the judge  referred
    to the appellant's skeleton argument and the report of  the  consultant
    psychologist Ms Williams, as being part of the  evidence  that  he  had
    before him.  He also referred to a series of letters provided  by  Body
    and Soul concerning E and the impact removal might have upon  him.   He
    set out in detail the oral evidence concerning the impact on E  of  his
    parents' imprisonment.  Other oral evidence in relation to E  was  also
    summarised.

36. At [134] the judge stated as follows:

         "A good deal of focus was put on E's reaction to the time when  his
         parents were in prison.  It is perfectly understandable that he was
         traumatised by their absence.  His behaviour was disturbed and that
         has been perfectly well described not only by his  grandparent  but
         also by the social worker and psychologist."

37. There is express recognition there of the evidence in  the  reports  in
    relation to E.

38. In the next paragraph there is reference  to  the  expectation  that  E
    would accompany the appellant back to Poland and that it was no part of
    the respondent's case that there should be separation.   At  [136]  one
    finds the following:

         "I  can  readily  understand  that  E  has  got  these  behavioural
         difficulties and has been placed on the autism spectrum rather than
         with a formal diagnosis of autism.  It seems to me, looking at  the
         totality  of  the  material,  that  although  there  will  be  some
         disruption to E by going to Poland with his mother, that really  he
         can be perfectly well cared for by his mother in her  home  country
         and he will be able to  gain  some  appropriate  help  and  support
         through the Polish educational system."

39. Again, at [140] the judge emphasised that he had "assessed as carefully
    as I can" the material presented about E.  He then stated however, that
    the right and proper  decision  for  the  appellant  was  that  she  be
    returned to Poland and "consequently" it seemed to him that the welfare
    of E was best served by remaining with his mother.

40. At [155],  being  the  last  paragraph  in  the  reasons  part  of  the
    determination, the judge stated that he had the best interests of E  in
    mind, and referred to  section  55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act 2009 in considering those best interests.

41. In my judgement, when one surveys the determination as a  whole  it  is
    apparent that the judge did have proper regard to the  evidence  before
    him from the independent social worker and the consultant  psychologist
    in relation to E.  It was not necessary for him to quote verbatim  from
    the  reports  which  he  plainly  considered.   I  do  not  accept  the
    proposition that the judge minimised or sidelined the evidence  in  the
    reports in stating there would be "some disruption" to E in  his  going
    to Poland with the appellant.  That conclusion was a recognition by the
    judge of the content of the reports.  He was entitled to find  however,
    that E would be  cared  for  by  his  mother  during  that  process  of
    transition.  He was similarly entitled to conclude that E would be able
    to obtain appropriate help and support through the  Polish  educational
    system.

42. The contention that at [140] the judge had decided that  the  appellant
    should be removed and that E's best interests  were  considered  as  an
    adjunct to her removal, is not made out.  Prior to that  conclusion  in
    that paragraph there was consideration of  E's  circumstances  and  the
    expert evidence.  Similarly, although the  judge  used  the  expression
    "best interests" for the first  time  in  the  last  paragraph  of  the
    determination, and also in that last paragraph referred to  s.55,  that
    belies the fact that the best interests assessment had  been  conducted
    during the course of the judge's reasons.

43. Again, it may be that  the  determination  would  have  benefited  from
    specific reference to the particular support that E is receiving in the
    UK, with reference to the evidence before the judge.  However,  it  was
    not encumbent on him to make  specific  reference  to  every  piece  of
    evidence, particularly in circumstances where it is apparent  that  the
    judge was aware that E leaving the UK would involve disruption for  him
    over and above what would ordinarily be expected in a child without his
    difficulties.

44. In conclusion therefore, I am not satisfied that there is any error  of
    law in the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Accordingly,  its
    decision to dismiss the appeal is to stand.

    Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point of law.  The decision of the Fist-tier Tribunal  to
    dismiss the appeal therefore stands.


Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek      29/12/15
