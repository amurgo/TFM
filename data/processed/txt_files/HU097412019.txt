                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS




     1. The respondent appeals with permission  a  decision  of  First-tier
        Tribunal Judge Devittie who allowed the appellant's appeal  against
        the respondent's decision to refuse the appellant's application for
        indefinite leave to remain on the basis of long residence.



Background


     2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 30 March  1988.  His
        application for indefinite leave to remain was refused pursuant  to
        paragraphs 276B and 322(5) on the basis that in his application  of
        5 April 2011 the appellant relied on earnings of �37,248  including
        a net profit from self-employment of �24,088 between 6  April  2010
        and April 2011. HMRC records for 2010/11 showed a profit  of  �661.
        In his application of 3 June 2013, he relied on a total  income  of
        �37,349 including a net profit of �25,090 between 6 April 2012  and
        5 April 2013. No self-employment profit was declared  to  HMRC  for
        this period.
     3. The Judge noted  the  appellant's  explanation  that  he  initially
        declared the correct figures to HMRC and  paid  his  accountant  in
        cash an amount to settled his liability but  that  the  accountant,
        without his knowledge, amended the returns in an incorrect  manner,
        the result of which led the respondent to accuse him of  deception.
        The appellant stated he became aware  of  the  errors  following  a
        letter from HMRC on 21  July  2014  and  took  immediate  steps  to
        contact his accountant.
     4. At [11] the Judge  did  not  find  the  appellant  had  provided  a
        satisfactory explanation  for  the  discrepancies  in  the  figures
        declared for the reasons set out at (i) - (iv) of that paragraph.
     5. At [12 - 13] the Judge sets out the core findings in the  following
        terms:

             12.  I therefore find  that  there  is  reliable  evidence  to
                  establish on a balance of probabilities that  the  conduct
                  of the appellant  was  sufficiently  reprehensible.  I  am
                  however  not  satisfied  taking  proper  account  of   all
                  relevant circumstances known about the  appellant  at  the
                  date of decision, that the respondent has established  the
                  appellants presence in the UK is undesirable. These are my
                  reasons:


                  The  appellant's  academic  background,  his   immigration
                  history, the fact that he was engaged in  self-employment,
                  do not persuade me that there  is  a  likelihood  that  he
                  would engage in any further deception  in  the  future.  I
                  take into account that the appellant has paid in full, the
                  extent of his liability to HMRC and  he  appears  to  have
                  done so promptly. The appellant is in  gainful  employment
                  as a subject access request consultant, and I do not  have
                  any doubt, that he has high level skills in this  area  of
                  work and therefore the capacity to  engage  in  meaningful
                  and honest economic activity in the  United  Kingdom.  The
                  appellant has lived in the United Kingdom  for  11  years.
                  There is no suggestion that other than  the  conduct  that
                  has given rise to this appeal, appellant  has  engaged  in
                  any other activity in breach of the  laws  of  the  United
                  Kingdom. He has no criminal convictions. He has  developed
                  strong friendships in the United Kingdom.  There  is  also
                  credible evidence that he has engaged in  charitable  work
                  for reasons not related  to  the  desire  to  enhance  his
                  prospects in this appeal.


             13.  I  therefore  find  that  the  appellant  does  meet  the
                  requirements of  the  immigration  rules  under  the  long
                  residence provisions. I do not find  that  there  are  any
                  compelling  public  interest  considerations  that   weigh
                  against appellant in the  assessment  of  proportionality.
                  The economic well-being of the UK is not  implicated.  The
                  appellant meets the English language requirements. He  has
                  accrued 10 years lawful residence. I accordingly find that
                  the refusal of leave under the long  residence  provisions
                  has great personal consequences for the appellant that are
                  not outweighed by the public interest, including the  need
                  to maintain effective immigration control.


     6. Permission to appeal was granted to the Secretary of State  in  the
        following terms:


             2.   The respondent's basis for seeking  leave  to  appeal  is
                  essentially that the FtT  Judge  made  an  irrational  and
                  perverse  decision,  particularly  in  the  light  of  the
                  judge's findings that the appellant.


     7. A perverse decision is one against the weight of evidence, which is
        a hight threshold to cross,  irrationality  is  a  lower  threshold
        suggesting a decision not made following a  fair  consideration  of
        the evidence.




The law


     8. The correct approach to a case of this nature has been confirmed by
        the Court of Appeal in Balajigari v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ  673  from
        which the following principles can be extracted:


        (i)  it is clear from the terms of paragraph 322 (5)  that  it  was
             not intended only to apply to cases in which there is a threat
             to national security [32];
        (ii)      para 322 (5) involves a two-stage  analysis,  whether  it
             applies first and then discretion falls to be considered [33];
        (iii)     for the first stage there must be  reliable  evidence  of
             sufficiently reprehensible conduct and an  assessment,  taking
             proper account of all relevant circumstances known  about  the
             applicant including positive features of  their  character  of
             whether their presence in the UK is undesirable [34];
        (iv)      the conduct can only be sufficiently reprehensible if  it
             is dishonest [35].  It is very hard to see how the  deliberate
             and dishonest submission of false earning figures to  HMRC  or
             the Home Office would not meet the threshold [37];
        (v)  the SSHD should incorporate the balancing  exercise  into  the
             decision-making process, in so far  as  Dadzie  and  Ojo  said
             otherwise the CA would disagree [38];
        (vi)      the guidance in Khan was endorsed with the  qualification
             that para 37 of the guidance  may  misstate  the  position;  a
             discrepancy between earnings declared to  HMRC  and  SSHD  may
             justifiably give rise to a suspicion of dishonesty but it does
             not justify that conclusion.  It calls for an explanation  and
             the SSHD must decide in the light of the explanation  or  lack
             of one whether he is satisfied  the  applicant  was  dishonest
             [42];
        (vii)     where SSHD is minded  to  refuse  ILR  on  the  basis  of
             reprehensible conduct he is required as a matter of procedural
             fairness to indicate clearly to the applicant that he has that
             suspicion; to give the applicant an  opportunity  to  respond,
             both as regards the conduct itself and as  regards  any  other
             reasons relied on as regards "undesirability" and the exercise
             of the second-stage assessment; and then to take that response
             into account before drawing the  conclusion  of  reprehensible
             conduct.  There does not have to be an  interview;  a  written
             procedure may suffice  [55]  [56],  but  the  availability  of
             administrative review did  not  satisfy  the  requirements  of
             procedural fairness [58];
        (viii)    the SSHD is not bound to take the same view as HMRC [68];
        (ix)      there is no Tameside duty on the SSHD to  make  enquiries
             of HMRC as to how they have dealt with relevant  errors  [69];
             the applicant can draw attention to what action  HMRC  did  or
             did not take [75];
        (x)  in the generality of cases a  Tier  1  applicant  for  ILR  is
             likely to have built up sufficient private life for Article  8
             to be engaged by his removal [86];
        (xi)      an adverse decision by the SSHD necessarily means that if
             the applicant has leave it can be curtailed so a  person  with
             leave is equally liable to removal [90];
        (xii)     this means that the tribunal will have to reach  its  own
             conclusions as  to  whether  the  interference  was  justified
             rather than conducting a rationality review  -  the  situation
             was analogous to Ahsan [2017] EWCA Civ 2009 [92];
        (xiii)    like Ahsan the  appropriate  route  of  challenge  is  by
             appeal to the FTT rather than JR to the UT [95];
        (xiv)     where an applicant has not included a human rights  claim
             in their ILR application  they  will  need  to  make  a  fresh
             application or wait until steps are taken to  enforce  removal
             [100] [101];
        (xv)      the Court of Appeal discussed the position in the current
      litigation [103];
        (xvi)     the applicant will need an opportunity to  give  evidence
             and call witnesses it is unlikely that a mere  assertion  that
             the matter was a "mistake" will be accepted without a full and
             particularised explanation of what the mistake was and how  it
             arose [106].



Discussion



     9. The Judge was aware of the guidance provided by the Court of Appeal
        to  which  there  is  specific  reference  in  the  decision  under
        challenge at [9]. Insofar as the first stage is concerned the Judge
        finds the appellant had not provided a satisfactory explanation for
        the  discrepancy  in  the  figures  and  that   his   conduct   was
        "sufficiently reprehensible".   That  does  not  appear  to  be  an
        express finding of dishonesty but can  be  inferred  as  such.  The
        Judge refers to [35] of the decision in  Balajigari  in  which  the
        Court of Appeal  record  a  submission  made  by  counsel  for  the
        appellant before them  that  an  earnings  discrepancy  case  could
        constitute  sufficiently  reprehensible  conduct  of   the   parent
        purposes of paragraph 322(5) but only if the  discrepancy  was  the
        result of dishonesty on the part of  the  applicant  which  is  not
        disputed by the Secretary of State. The Court of  Appeal  recognise
        that the provision of inaccurate figures to HMRC or the Home Office
        in support of  an  application  as  a  result  of  carelessness  or
        ignorance or poor advice could not constitute conduct rendering  it
        undesirable for an applicant to remain in the United Kingdom.  This
        is however recognition of errors that can be classed as genuine  or
        innocent.
    10. Notwithstanding this finding  the  Judge,  in  the  decision  under
        consideration, was not satisfied the respondent had established the
        appellants present  was  undesirable  for  which  the  Judge  gives
        reasons. The submission on behalf of the Secretary of State  by  Ms
        Bassi is that the Judge  in  coming  to  that  conclusion  had  not
        factored the appellant's deceit into the balancing exercise.
    11. The  determination  shows  the  first  part  of  the  exercise  was
        undertaken by the Judge in accordance with the guidance. It is hard
        to imagine that  having  spent  a  substantial  proportion  of  the
        determination discussing whether the appellant had behaved in  such
        a manner so as to constitute 'sufficiently  reprehensible  conduct'
        the Judge when immediately moving to the second stage of  assessing
        whether that was sufficient to enable the respondent  to  establish
        the decision is proportionate, would  have  completely  placed  the
        initial findings relating to the first aspect of the  case  out  of
        his mind. That suggests an  artificial  separation  which,  had  it
        occurred, would enable the respondent to proceed. I  do  not  find,
        however, that this was the  situation.  The  Judge  clearly  having
        found the appellant's conduct was 'sufficiently  reprehensible'  in
        relation to the difference between the figures  disclosed  to  HMRC
        and to the Home Office in 2010/11 and 2012/13 went on  to  consider
        the points  in  the  appellant's  favour  regarding  family  and/or
        private life in the United Kingdom. Balancing the  factors  in  the
        appellant's favour against those in favour of the respondent led to
        the conclusion that, notwithstanding the concerns that arose  as  a
        result of the failure to disclose  correct  figures  to  HMRC,  the
        weight of all remaining matters tipped the balance in favour of the
        appellant.
    12. Whilst the  respondent  considers  this  a  generous  decision  the
        grounds fail to establish the Judge has erred in a manner  material
        to the decision to allow the appeal sufficient to warrant the Upper
        Tribunal interfering any further in relation to  this  matter.  The
        grounds are, in  effect,  disagreement  with  the  outcome  of  the
        property undertaken proportionality balancing exercise. It  is  not
        established  the  conclusions  are  outside  the  range  of   those
        reasonably available to the Judge on the evidence.  The  respondent
        fails to establish the decision is perverse or arguably  irrational
        in the fact sensitive assessment.


Decision

    13. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
        decision. The determination shall stand.

   Anonymity.


    14. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


I make no  such  order  pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
