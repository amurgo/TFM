For the respondent:    Mr A Hutton, Home Office presenting officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   This is an appeal by a citizen of Somalia against  the  decision  of  an
   adjudicator, Mr PD Southern, sitting at Hatton Cross on 6 June 2003,  in
   which he dismissed the original appeal on both asylum and  human  rights
   grounds. That appeal  had  been  brought  on  31  January  2003  through
   solicitors.   However, on 25 March the appellant had himself sent  in  a
   reply to directions, in which he explained he no longer had the services
   of those solicitors.

2. On that basis the first hearing adjudicator on 3 April put the case back
   for full hearing on 6 June.   However on 6 June there  was  neither  any
   appearance by the appellant himself, nor by anyone on his behalf.    The
   adjudicator noted the history of the case and decided to proceed, giving
   a full reasoned decision on its merits. On 23 June the decision was sent
   out.  Not until 28 July did the appellant  appeal,  well  out  of  time,
   sending with his notice of appeal a typed English letter explaining that
   he had no solicitor, and another  from  a  body  called  the  UK  Somali
   Benadir Community Council.   This is a community  organization,  without
   any official status so far as this country is concerned.   Their  letter
   is dated 11 July and reads as follows:


   This is to confirm that  the  above  mentioned  applicant  is  a  Somali
   National of Benadir origin.   He belongs to the Ashraf clan.   The claim
   is to be determined on the basis of his original statement forwarded  to
   the Home Office in support of his original application.   He is a member
   of the Benadiri minority group whose application for refugee status  has
   been given consideration by the Home Office.  We note that our member is
   under consideration since his arrival in the United Kingdom.   We  would
   therefore urge to make a decision at your earliest opportunity and grant
   Mr Hussein full refugee status.  Your co-operation  on  this  matter  is
   highly appreciated and look forward to a positive response.  In the mean
   time, please do not hesitate to contact our community  for  any  further
   enquiry about the applicant.

3. Time for that application was extended  and  permission  granted.   That
   decision was sent out with  the  notice  of  hearing  for  today  on  23
   September 2003.   The chairman who granted permission pointed  out  that
   the appellant would be well advised to seek representation, referring to
   a well known organisation which operates free of charge,  whose  address
   could be had from the Tribunal.  Nothing further at all was  done  about
   that.  The appellant said first the organisation was busy; then  it  had
   been too late, because of the 14 day limit for filing documents.

4. We do not see why this appellant, who was in touch, he  says,  with  his
   community's council in this country should not have been able to  obtain
   representation  during  the  nearly  six  months  since  permission  was
   granted. The appellant has been able  to  bring  with  him  a  bilingual
   friend, a Mr Omar Ali, who interpreted with great skill, and to whom  we
   are very grateful.  We decided to proceed to deal with the appeal on its
   merits.

5. This appellant's case depended on his  being  a  member  of  the  Ashraf
   minority tribe.   Ashraf means 'noble' in Arabic.  This  refers  to  the
   claimed  descent  of  the  tribe  from  Hassan  and  Hussein,  immediate
   descendants of the  Prophet  himself.    Every  Ashraf  sub-clan  either
   claims descent from Hassan or from Hussein.   The  appellant  was  asked
   about this at questions 1 to 15 of his interview.   He  claimed  descent
   from Hussein, and  said  he  was  a  member  of  the  Balaawi  sub-clan.
   However, he was quite unable to give the names of any other sub-clans of
   the Hussein branch.

6. His explanation for  that  was  that  all  mention  of  clans  had  been
   discouraged under the r�gime of Siad Barr�,  the  former  President  who
   fell from power in 1991.   We fail to understand why if the  appellant's
   father could tell him as he said he had done, no doubt  in  the  privacy
   of their own home, that they came  from  the  Balaawi  sub-clan  of  the
   Hussein branch, he should not have been able  or  willing  to  tell  him
   anything about the other sub-clans.

7. We know from quite a number of years' joint experience of hearing Somali
   cases what an important part the clan and sub-clan  structure  plays  in
   Somali life.   We have never heard it suggested  before  that  all  this
   traditional information became  completely  submerged  during  the  Siad
   Barr� r�gime.   There is no independent evidence to support that, and we
   do not accept it.

8. We then come to the question of the Community  Council.   The  appellant
   says he was taken to their headquarters, after the adjudicator  hearing,
   by a Somali friend.  The Community Council representative asked him  his
   clan details and to bring  a  witness  to  confirm  his  descent.    The
   Community Council have nothing to say at all about that in their letter.
    The appellant's explanation for that is that they issue such letters in
   the standard form only.  That may be so  but  it  renders  such  letters
   practically valueless as confirmation of his  or  any  other  claimant's
   account.

9. The appellant told us that he had witnesses  available  to  confirm  his
   origins, whom he had only got to know since the adjudicator hearing.  We
   do not accept that, during the 5 months during which he was waiting  for
   that hearing, for the last two of which he knew he had no solicitor, and
    having been a teacher, as he says, in Somalia and living amongst a very
   large Somali resident community in London,  this  appellant  should  not
   have been able to get such witnesses before the adjudicator  if  he  had
   tried. We declined to hear them when they were put forward for the first
   time before us today.  There is nothing to show that the adjudicator was
   clearly wrong in the decision to  which  he  came,  and  the  appeal  is
   dismissed.
