Representation
For the appellant:      Miss C.  Record,  Counsel,  instructed  by  David  A
      Grand
For the respondent: Miss T Hart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria.  He was born  on  22  September  1964
and so is now forty years old.  He appeals the decision of  an  Adjudicator,
Mr R J Haynes, who, in a determination  promulgated  on  12  November  2003,
dismissed his appeal against a decision of the respondent that  he  was  not
entitled to enter the  United  Kingdom  as  the  husband  of  his  wife  and
sponsor.

Like the Entry Clearance Officer, the Adjudicator  was  not  satisfied  that
the  appellant  would  be  able  to  maintain  himself  and  any  dependants
adequately without additional recourse to public funds  in  accordance  with
paragraph  281(v) of HC 395.

In his form IM2B dated 3 April 2002, the appellant said that he worked as  a
sales assistant.  In response  to  the  question  'What  employment  do  you
intend to have in the United Kingdom?' he replied 'None at the moment'.   He
went on to say that no arrangements had been made for his employment in  the
United Kingdom.  His  wife  was  not  presently  employed  although  she  is
qualified as a nurse and his sponsor  had  not  made  any  arrangements  for
employment in the United Kingdom.

The appellant was interviewed concerning his application on  22  July  2002.
He was asked at question 76 if he had a job.  He replied 'Helping to  [sell]
some things like wrist watch.  He has a big store.'  He was asked if he  had
a salary and he replied 'Yes, any time I  want  money  he  gives  me  pocket
money is (sic) 20,000 in a month'.  He said that he hoped  to  work  in  the
United Kingdom and would take any good job.

These things led to the Entry Clearance Officer refusing the application  on
22 July 2002.

In his explanatory statement the respondent said that the appellant said  he
helped his brother sell  wrist  watches.   He  did  not  receive  a  regular
salary.  The casual payment of 20,000 Naira was worth about �100 per  month.
 The Entry Clearance Officer noted that the appellant had no  formal  skills
or qualifications.  The Entry Clearance Officer said that he had  'not  come
across well' at interview and the Entry Clearance Officer was not  satisfied
that the appellant would find suitable employment in the United Kingdom.'

The case came before the Adjudicator on 3 October 2003.   On  that  occasion
the appellant was represented by Miss Record who asked  the  Adjudicator  to
look  at  additional  evidence.   This  evidence  had  not  been  served  in
accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the   standard   directions.    The
Adjudicator would not consider  it.   His  approach  was  not  satisfactory.
Rule 48(5) of the Immigration and Asylum Appeals (Procedure) Rules 2003   is
in the following terms:

  'An Adjudicator or the Tribunal must not consider any evidence  which  is
  not filed or served in accordance with time limits set out in these Rules
  or directions given under Rule 38, unless satisfied that there  are  good
  reasons to do so.'

When faced with applications to  consider  evidence  served  other  than  in
accordance with directions,  it  is  incumbent  upon  Adjudicators  to  show
expressly that they have considered the requirements  of  Rule  48(5).   Two
things stand out form that Rule.  The Rule is  in  strong  mandatory  terms.
There is a clear presumption against receiving evidence  served  improperly.
However, the evidence is to be received if there are  "good  reasons  to  do
so".  Adjudicators really should set out the arguments raised in support  of
the  contention  that  there  were  'good  reasons'  and  the  Adjudicator's
response to the arguments raised.  To the extent that  the  Adjudicator  did
not do that he was in error.

Before us  things  took  an  interesting  turn  because  the  appellant  had
neglected to provide us with any  additional  material  in  accordance  with
directions.  We were provided with a witness statement  and  a  letter  from
the potential  employer  dated  11  October  2004.   These  were  served  by
facsimile on 4 October 2004.  Standard directions  required  that  they  are
provided in triplicate no later  than  fourteen  days  before  the  hearing.
Plainly they had not been provided as they  should  have  been.   Miss  Hart
objected to us considering them.

We had to look at them in order to make an informed decision  about  whether
they should be considered.

The witness statement was from the sponsor.  It was dated 11  October  2004.
The sponsor said that she had not attended before  the  Adjudicator  because
she thought that it was sufficient to show a  job  had  been  offered.   She
then gave details of her circumstances and said  that  the  appellant  would
have an income of �18,000 a year from a job  and  would  bring  with  him  a
capital sum of �5000 that had been saved 'through his brother's firm'.   She
was satisfied that the family could live on their means.

The  second  document  is  a  letter  from  Mr                           who
describes himself as the  chairman/chief  executive  of  Arms  International
Security Services Limited.  Mr                         says  that  he  knows
the appellant and has known him for twenty-one years.  He  trusts  him.   He
was prepared to offer him a job on arrival in the United Kingdom 'as a  full
time security officer on a salary of �18,000 per annum'.

We are not prepared to take note of this  additional  evidence.   There  had
been no application under Rule 21 of  the  Immigration  and  Asylum  Appeals
(Procedure) Rules 2003 and, much more importantly, the  additional  material
does not appear  to  be  relevant  to  any  alleged  error  of  law  by  the
Adjudicator.  There were no "good reasons" for us to consider them.

Miss Record told us that the document that  the  Adjudicator  was  asked  to
consider, but would not consider, was a letter dated 7 August 2003  from  Mr
                       .  In all material respects other than the  date,  it
was the same as the letter tendered to us.

If the Adjudicator had looked at that letter he would  have  known  that  he
should not have considered it.  Miss Record said that it  was  relevant  and
that was a good enough reason for its  admission.   With  respect,  that  is
wrong.  Adjudicators should not look  at  anything  that  is  not  relevant.
Mere relevance cannot amount to a 'good reason' to admit evidence  that  was
served late although we are open to the possibility of it being  appropriate
to  receive  late  evidence  that  is  highly  pertinent  and   particularly
compelling.

The appellant had given no indication at all about how he would obtain  work
in the United Kingdom or what kind of work he was suited to do.  Further,  a
letter of the kind  offered  that  is  unsupported  by  oral  testimony  and
untested by cross-examination is of little  weight  especially  when  it  is
offered  in  circumstances  where  the  respondent  had  no  opportunity  to
investigate it.

The Adjudicator was had to consider with evidence relating to facts  at  the
date of decision.  Whilst it  is  quite  right  to  say  the  appellant  had
indicated that he would obtain 'any good job' in the United Kingdom, it  was
wholly unforeseeable at the date of decision, 22 July 2002 that a job  offer
would emerge in August 2003.

The letter that was offered late to  the  Adjudicator  was  of  very  little
value.  Even if the Adjudicator had received it he would not have been  able
to place much weight on it.

Further, the Secretary of State decided not to  attend  the  hearing  before
the adjudicator.  It must be assumed that the Secretary of State gives  some
consideration to the  nature  of  the  cases  and  evidence  when  making  a
decision not to send a Presenting Officer.  It would  have  been  unfair  to
have taken notice of evidence that had not been served before  the  hearing.
This is not a decisive point.  Parties  should  attend  hearings.   However,
the absence of a party is something to consider  when  deciding  whether  or
not to receive evidence about which the absent party cannot have notice.

Although the Adjudicator can be criticised for  not  explaining  better  his
refusal to receive evidence offered at the hearing, we  find  it  impossible
to say there is any material  error  of  law  here.   There  are  many  good
reasons to refuse to consider the evidence.

The operation of this rule has been considered by the Tribunal in  MD  (good
reasons to consider) Pakistan [2004] UKIAT00197
'Reported'  and  then  in  EA  (Immigration  -  Rule  48(5))  Ghana   [2004]
UKIAT00227 which shows that "good reasons" may well be  harder  to  find  in
immigration  cases  than  in  asylum  and  human  rights  cases  where   the
consequences  of  error  can  be  very   grave.    This   case   illustrates
circumstances where there were plainly  no good  reason  to  admit  evidence
served late and the appeal is reported as an example of such circumstances.

It follows that we dismiss this appeal.
