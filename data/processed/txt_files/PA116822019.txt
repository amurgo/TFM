                                MAGDALENA [J]

                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent




                            DECISION AND REMITTAL


 1. This decision is made under rules 34(1) and 40(3)(a).

 2. On 3 December 2020 I wrote to the parties as follows:


             "I have reviewed the file in this case and note that following
             the grant of permission the Secretary of State invites the
             Tribunal to determine the appeal by remitting the case to the
             First-tier Tribunal for a rehearing on all issues.


             That course of action appears to me to be appropriate in the
             circumstances and I therefore propose to follow it without
             more ado.  Any submissions to the contrary will be considered
             if received within 21 days of the date of this letter."

 3. Both parties have consented to that course of action.

 4. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal for  error  of  law
    and remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh decision.
