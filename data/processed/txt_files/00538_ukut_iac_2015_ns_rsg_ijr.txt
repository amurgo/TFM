                    ON AN APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW

                              APPROVED JUDGMENT
                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -



    JUDGE  storey:  Both  applicants  are  citizens  of  India,  the  first
    applicant being aged 27 and the second aged 26.  With  permission  both
    challenge a decision refusing each of them entry clearance as a Tier  5
    Temporary Worker -  Religious  Worker  under  the  Points-Based  System
    (PBS). Both have been in service in India  as  monks  or  "ragi"  since
    2002. Their applications had been sponsored  by  the  Nanaksar  Satsang
    Sabha Gurdwara which serves a significant  population  of  the  British
    Sikh community in  Southall  in  West  London.  Following  a  grant  of
    permission in both cases, their applications for  judicial  review  are
    heard together with the agreement of all sides.


2.   The decisions challenged in both cases were made on 6 January  2014  by
    an  Entry  Clearance  Officer  acting  as  administrative  reviewer  in
    response to an application for administrative review. However, in  both
    cases  those  decisions  maintained  earlier  decisions  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer dated 11 November 2013.


The administrative review context


3.   It is convenient at this point  to  refer  briefly  to  the  submission
    raised, almost as  a  preliminary  issue,  by  the  respondent  in  the
    detailed grounds of defence even  though  it  was  not  pursued  by  Mr
    Cannings before me. It  was  that  the  applicants  could  not  succeed
    because the decisions they challenged were not the underlying decisions
    of 11 November 2013  but  the  administrative  review  decisions  of  6
    January 2014. It was submitted in this context that the challenges made
    to the latter "refer to matters  that  are  not  within  the  scope  of
    administrative review". An initial difficulty with this  submission  is
    that  the  grounds  do  on  their  face  fall  within  the   scope   of
    administrative review, at least going by the description of  what  that
    covers provided by the respondent. This description  identifies,  inter
    alia, an Entry  Clearance  Officer's  failure  to  consider  everything
    submitted  and  failure  to  give  adequate  reasons.  The   applicants
    challenged the January 2014 decisions on both of these grounds, if  not
    others also within  the  scope  of  administrative  review.  A  further
    difficulty is that it is  sufficiently  clear  that  the  January  2014
    decisions are challenged for maintaining the original  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's refusal decision and the nature of such a  challenge  entails
    that the two are therefore to be read together.  For  these  reasons  I
    decide (whether or not strictly it is a preliminary issue or not)  that
    the decisions under challenge do fall  within  the  scope  of  judicial
    review.


Individual applications and decisions


4.   It is important to  keep  in  mind,  however,  that  although  the  two
    applications are  being  heard  together  and  do  feature  overlapping
    documentation, each applicant submitted an individual application, each
    was interviewed separately and each received an individual decision and
    an individual administrative review decision.


The first applicant


5. In the case of the first applicant, the Entry Clearance  Officer  in  the
    11 November 2013 refusal decision noted that  he  had  applied  for  an
    entry  clearance  in  2012  and  he  had  said  at  interview  that   a
    representative of the Gurdwara in Southall had attended the Gurdwara in
    Delhi and observed him playing the Tabla  (a  musical  instrument)  and
    decided to inform the senior priest about a position  in  the  Southall
    Gurdwara.  The Entry Clearance Officer noted that the  first  applicant
    was unaware how much he would be paid; that he had not spoken to anyone
    with regards to the position himself and it was  all  arranged  by  the
    senior priest in the Gurdwara (he had not seen  the  job  advertisement
    himself),  that  he  was  unaware  of  the  wages;  and  that  he  knew
    accommodation was provided but could not provide specific details.


6.   The Entry Clearance  Officer's  reasons  for  refusal  were  stated  as
    being: that he did not find it credible that someone  who  had  applied
    for and secured a job in another country would not have  discussed  the
    salary, building accommodation  and  requirements;  that  although  his
    certificate of sponsorship stated that he would be paid �6.50  an  hour
    he said in interview his  salary  had  not  been  specified;  and  that
    despite the job advertisement stating that  the  Gurdwara  in  Southall
    required a priest for prayers and baptising and someone to  participate
    in Kirtan (devotional music), he had stated he only played  the  Tabla,
    that he could recite prayers but his main role was to  play  the  Tabla
    and he had not read the job advertisement.


7.   The Entry Clearance Officer administrative reviewer in the letter of  6
    January 2014 stated that:


         "I note you have stated that you only play the tabla.  However, the
         role requests  more  skills  and  duties  that  you  do  not  have.
         Therefore it is not accepted that in  the  interview  you  had  the
         knowledge or responses to demonstrate that you would genuinely take
         up this role."


The second applicant


8.   In respect of the  second  applicant,  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    decision stated that he was unaware of how much he would  be  paid;  he
    said in interview  his  salary  had  not  been  specified  whereas  his
    certificate of sponsorship specified �6.50 per hour; that he  had  said
    he had not seen the job advertisement; and that he  knew  accommodation
    would be provided but could not provide specific details.


9.   The subsequent administrative reviewer decision stated that:


         "Whilst it is noted that the officials of the management  committee
         had provided supporting letters it  is  your  intentions  that  are
         paramount.  Given that you knew very little regarding  your  living
         arrangements and  salary,  that  in  the  UK  your  intentions  are
         questionable, in the round it is not accepted that in the interview
         you had the knowledge or responses to demonstrate  that  you  would
         genuinely take up this role."


10.  Both  the  applicants  submitted  with  their  applications  supporting
    letters from the president of the Southall  Gurdwara  and  the  general
    secretary of the Nanaksar Satsang  Sabha  in  Pune  in  India.  In  the
    judicial review bundles there was additional evidence  including  notes
    of interview prepared by or on behalf of the applicants. It was pointed
    out that the applicants had both  been  granted  points  by  the  Entry
    Clearance  Officer  for  the  certificate  of   sponsorship   and   for
    maintenance.  The  judicial  review  grounds  pointed  out   that   the
    applicants had left their family homes and lived  in  the  Gurdwara  in
    Delhi from a young age and did  not  have  dealings  with  families  or
    connections with economic life outside and they had  been  selected  by
    the head priest.


Grounds in common


11.  The grounds and joint skeleton argument read together  raise  a  number
    of points applicable to both applicants which I will proceed to  reduce
    to their essentials, not necessarily in the order in  which  they  were
    advanced.


Religious worker category


12.  Two points are taken in relation to the nature of  the  category  under
    which the applicants  applied.  It  is  said  first  of  all  that  the
    respondent erroneously assumed that the applicants were applying for  a
    job, thereby failing to recognise that they were not applying for a job
    in the normal sense. It  is  also  said  that  the  respondent  wrongly
    equated a religious person who had a calling and who  has  given  up  a
    material lifestyle with a worker in the ordinary sense.


13.  In relation to those two linked grounds, my conclusion  is  that  there
    was no Wednesbury unreasonableness on the part of  the  respondent.  My
    principal reason for so concluding has to do with  the  nature  of  the
    Immigration Rules under which both  applicants  applied.  They  are  of
    course rules laid down by  the  Secretary  of  State  and  approved  by
    Parliament. By these rules she has determined that  since  27  November
    2008 those wishing to come for the  purposes  of  performing  religious
    work in places of worship in the  UK  must  now  apply  under   Tier  5
    (Temporary  Workers)  Migrants  of  the  PBS  within  the   subcategory
    "religious worker". By paragapah 245ZO(i) the Entry  Clearance  Officer
    must be satisfied that the applicant "genuinely intends  to  undertake,
    and is capable of undertaking, the role recorded in the Certificate  of
    Sponsorship Checking  Service".    The  Secretary  of  State  has  also
    specified that a form of application has to  be  completed,  personally
    signed by the applicant, furnishing certain details.


14.  It is not suggested in terms by the grounds or by Mr  Gill  that  these
    Rules are ultra vires or at a general level  offend  public  law  norms
    and, in any event, were I asked to decide the matter I would find  that
    they are entirely lawful.


15.  Whilst it can be expected that in operating Tier 5  the  respondent  is
    sensitive to the specific context of a religious worker and understands
    that applicants may well include those  who  do  not  engage  with  the
    material world, the requirements  they  lay  down  are  ones  that  all
    applicants can reasonably be expected to meet.   Under  the  rules  the
    onus is on the applicant to show he meets  the  relevant  requirements.
    Thus, if a person applies for such work he can reasonably  be  expected
    to apprise himself of those requirements and  be  able  to  demonstrate
    genuine intentions and capability.


16.  To the extent that the argument raised by the  sponsoring  Gurdwara  on
    behalf of the applicants is that the applicants are unworldly, then  it
    is pertinent to note that under the certificate of  sponsorship  system
    the sponsor takes on a number of legal obligations  (including  payment
    of the minimum wage) and is also required under the Home Office Tier  5
    (Temporary Worker-Religious Worker) visa guidance to give the applicant
    the information they use on their  certificate  about  the  applicant's
    job, "eg your working hours". A certificate of sponsorship is a  unique
    reference number that holds information about  the  job  the  applicant
    will do and his personal details. The guide states that  "Your  sponsor
    will give you the certificate of sponsorship". In this  context,  if  a
    sponsor of a religious worker has any reason to think that  because  of
    the restricted environment in which those they  wish  to  sponsor  have
    lived, that they will not know much about the job they  are  asking  to
    undertake, it must be for that sponsor to take active steps  to  ensure
    that such applicants are apprised of the requirements of the rules  and
    informed of what the sponsor  has  stated  about  the  work  they  will
    undertake and their capabilities.


17.  I note that in this case it  is  part  of  the  submissions  that  both
    applications for entry clearance were very much at  the  initiative  of
    the Southall Gurdwara. The General Secretary's letter states  that  "it
    was in fact our  sister  organisation  in  London  who  requested  [the
    applicants']  presence  under  a  permit-free  voluntary  contract   of
    employment...". The sincerity of the  Puna  and  London  organisations'
    intentions is not in doubt; they wish to  ensure  for  perfectly  valid
    reasons that  the  London  Gurdwara  can  perform  important  religious
    services in their local community.  However,  by  the  same  token  the
    London sponsors must have been aware that  applicants  were  being  put
    forward under the Tier 5 scheme and that under that  scheme  they  were
    required to fill in forms in the usual way and would likely be  subject
    to an interview; and that therefore it was important for the sponsoring
    organisation to put them in a position where  they  would  be  able  to
    address satisfactorily questions going to the degree of knowledge  they
    had of the religious worker role that they were going to perform.


18.  This observation I hope deals with the contention that  the  respondent
    unreasonably  expected  the  applicants  to  demonstrate  knowledge  of
    salary, accommodation etc. Put another  way  round,  no  applicant  can
    expect exemption from the core requirements set down in the Rules going
    to intention and capability.


19.  Turning to the second limb of the argument relating to  the  nature  of
    the work, for much the same reasons as I have just given, I do not  see
    that the respondent equated a religious  worker  who  has  given  up  a
    material lifestyle with a worker in the ordinary sense. The  respondent
    simply imposed requirements that all - worldly or unworldly - religious
    workers are required, and can reasonably be expected, to meet.


20.  The respondent is also said to have erred in failing to have regard  to
    the issue of the genuineness of the applicants as religious workers and
    also in failing to assess whether it was necessary to take into account
    the evidence and views of those who trained them  as  set  out  in  the
    supporting letters that were sent with the application.  I  will  treat
    these as in fact two separate grounds, one relating to the  genuineness
    of intentions and the other  relating  to  the  issue  of  whether  the
    respondent took into account relevant evidence.





The genuineness requirement


21.  Dealing with the genuineness of intentions, as I  think  is  recognised
    in other parts of the applicants' submissions, the decision was clearly
    made with express reference to paragraph 245ZO(i),  which  (as  already
    noted) requires the Entry Clearance Officer to be  satisfied  that  the
    applicant genuinely intends to undertake and is capable of  undertaking
    the role recorded by the certificate of sponsorship checking service.


22.  The questions the applicants were asked were clearly  relevant  to  the
    establishment of this requirement. Further, in  the  compulsory  "self-
    assessment"  Points  Based  System  Form  that  both   applicants   had
    completed, in reply to the question "How much will you earn?" there had
    been written �11,557.  Despite being able to give this specific  detail
    in this form personally signed by  each  of  them,  the  applicants  at
    interview said they did not know how much they would be  paid.  It  was
    entirely within  the  range  of  reasonable  responses  for  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer to attach significant weight to that discrepancy.


23.  It must also be borne in mind that in relation to both  applicants  the
    sponsor had  circulated  a  job  description  in  the  form  of  a  job
    advertisement in a newspaper stating  that  the  Gurdwara  in  Southall
    required a priest for prayers and baptising  and  required  someone  to
    participate in Kirtan - a job description that clearly went beyond  the
    performance of Kirtan (and playing the Tabla as part of that).


Taking into account relevant evidence


24.  Turning to the allegation that the respondent  unreasonably  failed  to
    take account of relevant evidence, both administrative reviewer letters
    refer to the supporting  documents  having  been  taken  into  account.
    There has been some reference to  whether  post-decision  evidence  can
    properly be taken into account in  this  context.   However,  from  the
    chronology, it is at  least  clear  that  the  administrative  reviewer
    (whose decision of 6 January 2014 is the one which is challenged in the
    claim form) had before him or  her  grounds  that  were  submitted  for
    administrative review. The latter reminded the Entry Clearance  Officer
    of the contents of earlier documents that had been submitted on  behalf
    of the applicants. There is no reason to consider  that  reminder  went
    unheeded.


25.  It is also clear from the chronology that the Entry  Clearance  Officer
    concerned with these two applicants sought to discuss their cases  with
    the two relevant officials of the Gurdwara in Southall, which in itself
    is an indication that the Entry Clearance Officer in question was aware
    of the background information, certainly prior  to  the  administrative
    review decision.


26.  It is contended that the respondent effectively  failed  to  take  into
    account the contents of the two letters, one from the monastery in Pune
    and one from the Southall  Gurdwara  giving  specific  details  of  the
    Nanaksar  Satsung  Sabha  organisation,  its  provision  of  places  of
    worship, the spiritual aspects and prayer functions performed by  monks
    and administered by local community members  for  religious  and  moral
    education. It  is  explained  in  these  letters  that  monks/preachers
    normally  receive  their  training  from  India  where  they  serve  an
    apprenticeship in the Nanaksar discipline and the London letter  states
    that "Those who serve at our Gurdwara have been selected for a position
    from the various Nanaksar Gurdwara in India, due to  their  dedication,
    ability, experience and achievements within the  Nanaksar  organisation
    in India".  It is also emphasised that the monks in India are not  paid
    wages and are provided  with  accommodation,  food,  clothing  and  all
    expense required to meet their needs. Medical care, to-and-fro  travel,
    contingencies and other incidental charges and expenses are defrayed by
    the organisation. However, neither  of  these  letters  identified  the
    applicants by name or individually identified the extent or  nature  of
    their capabilities. Their contents did not require the  decision  maker
    to comment specifically on them.


27.  The grounds appear at least in one point to assert that the  respondent
    erred not only in failing to take account of this documentary  evidence
    but in failing to treat it as determinative  because  the  Gurdwara  in
    Southall had "vetted" the  applicants.   That  assertion  bivouacs  far
    beyond the scope of reasonable argument. If accepted it would amount to
    the assertion that there should be an immigration rule that permits the
    Southall Gurdwara to essentially pick the religious worker for  itself,
    rather than for the Entry Clearance Officer to do so  by  operation  of
    the Rules approved by Parliament.


Duty of inquiry


28.  It is contended that the respondent  failed  to  perform  the  duty  of
    enquiry to which she is subject and it is said that the Entry Clearance
    Officer should have put  his  or  her  own  doubts  to  the  applicants
    regarding their intentions.


29. First of all, whilst I would accept (and Mr Cannings accepted on  behalf
    of the respondent) that there is a general duty on  the  respondent  to
    make enquiries relevant to the decision, the respondent  in  this  case
    did make enquiries of the  sponsors  in  London  and  did  not  confine
    himself (or herself) to the interview.


30.  Further, the applicants had professed no knowledge of  certain  matters
    relating to the wage that was to be paid for the  job  and  details  of
    accommodation; hence, in light of their answers, it would not have been
    pertinent to make further enquiries on those matters.


31.  Secondly, in  general  terms,  whilst  there  was  a  general  duty  of
    enquiry, that does not mean that the onus under the Rules rests on  the
    Entry Clearance Officer to prove that the applicant does not  meet  the
    requirements. The burden of  proof  under  the  Rules  remains  on  the
    applicants to show that they meet the requirements of the Rules on  the
    balance of probabilities.


32. In regard to  Mr  Gill's  arguments  that  the  respondent  should  have
    undertaken further and better inquiries, I would simply make the  point
    that public law is not a counsel of perfection and  whilst  there  were
    some shortcomings in the Entry Clearance  Officer's  decision  letters,
    both the original letters  of  November  2013  and  the  administrative
    reviewer  letters,  such  shortcomings  have  not  been  shown  to   be
    sufficient to render the decisions Wednesbury unreasonable.


Taking into account irrelevant factors


33.  It has been suggested by Mr Gill that there  was  also  a  taking  into
    account of irrelevant factors, and he made reference in this regard  to
    the requirement that the  applicants  show  they  had  details  of  the
    accommodation. In my judgement the Entry Clearance Officer was entitled
    in order to assess  intentions  and  capability  to  enquire  into  the
    applicants' state of knowledge regarding such matters as the  pay  that
    was to be paid for the job under the requirements of the Tier 5  scheme
    and the nature of the accommodation.


34.  This links back to a point raised earlier, namely that in my  judgement
    there is a duty on the part of the sponsor in  this  type  of  case  to
    ensure that the applicants are properly informed of what is expected of
    them by way of knowledge to be shown at an interview.


Grounds specific to the first applicant


35.  I turn to consider the  specific  ground  that  relates  to  the  first
    applicant. It is submitted that the respondent  irrationally  concluded
    that he had said he only played the Tabla, whereas the applicant in his
    interview was simply describing what he does in  India.  It  is  argued
    that in reply to question 44 the first applicant had confirmed that  he
    had the skills mentioned in the  advertisement  and  further  that  the
    evidence from the Nanaksar Satsung  Sabha  organisation  was  that  the
    monks acquire a range of skills in the course of their training and  it
    is not in dispute that both of these applicants had been in service  as
    monks since 2002.


36.  It is also noted that the applicant's own record of  interview  records
    him saying that he was going to do Kirtan and that  his  main  duty  is
    Tabla, not his sole duty.  However, even assuming  that  the  applicant
    was simply describing what he does, the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was
    entitled to consider  what  light  that  shed  on  his  capability  and
    intentions to do the specific work in the UK and it  is  clear,  as  Mr
    Gill himself acknowledged, that the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  did  at
    least in certain questions seek to elicit from the  applicant  what  he
    thought he would be doing on arrival in Southall.


37.  Secondly, leaving aside the fact that the applicant himself  said  that
    he had not read the job advertisement, the  advertisement,  as  I  have
    already mentioned, did refer not just to playing  the  Tabla  or  other
    requirements of Kirtan but other duties and the answer to  question  44
    cannot be read as a declaration of intention or capability  to  perform
    those other duties.


38.  Further the respondent  was  not  obliged  to  accept  the  appellant's
    unparticularised evidence as set out in the background  letters  as  to
    what the generality of Sikh monks do.  I do accept that  these  letters
    sought to describe what happened to the entire cadre  of  monks  (ragi)
    who undergo training from an early age in the Gurdwara in India, but it
    remains that they did not identify any individual features relating  to
    the two applicants.


39.  In regard to the interview notes, the respondent originally took  issue
    with the fact that  there  was  no  statement  of  truth.  Although  Mr
    Cannings has not mentioned it, I do now have the statement of truth and
    I do not understand the respondent to take any point about  the  formal
    state of that evidence. That said, I do not  consider  that  the  notes
    furnished identify any matter that the Entry Clearance  Officer  failed
    to take into account.


40.  For the above reasons I refuse both these applications.


41.  I refuse permission to appeal to both applicants.


42.  Costs to be assessed as agreed and if not  agreed  written  submissions
    to be made within seven days from the written judgment of the Tribunal.
