For the Appellant:     Mr Sharma, Counsel instructed by direct access
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are both nationals of India.  They  are  respectively  a
    husband (born on the 23rd February 1984) and wife (1st May 1984).   Mrs
    [M]'s dependent is the couple's young child.




    The First Appellant's Appeal

 2. The First Appellant Mr  [T]  applied  on  the  20th  January  2018  for
    indefinite leave to remain on the basis that he had accrued ten  years'
    lawful residence in accordance with paragraph 276B of  the  Immigration
    Rules. That application was refused on the 23rd January 2018 under  the
    'general grounds for refusal'. The Respondent invoked paragraph  322(5)
    of the Rules: although it was accepted that Mr [T] met the  substantive
    requirements of 276B the Secretary of State was  satisfied  that  there
    were matters arising in respect of Mr [T]'s character and conduct which
    meant that refusal would  be  conducive  to  the  public  good.   Those
    matters were discrepancies  identified  by  two  respective  government
    departments in respect of Mr [T]'s claimed earnings.  In  2011  he  had
    told the  UVKI  one  thing,  and  HMRC  another.  The  effect  of  that
    information was that he got  further  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    Migrant, whilst at the same time paying minimal tax. The  Secretary  of
    State was satisfied that Mr [T] had exercised deception  in  giving  at
    least one of these figures, and found that this justified refusal.

 3. Mr [T] appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. In  a  determination  dated
    the 16th October 2018 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Mayall)  dismissed
    the appeal, finding that Mr [T] had given  evidence  that  was  neither
    honest nor credible. Judge Mayall concluded that paragraph  322(5)  was
    engaged and upheld the Secretary of State's reasoning.

 4. Mr [T] appealed to the Upper Tribunal. Permission was  granted  on  the
    17th December 2019, in limited  terms,  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Boyes.

 5.  On the 18th January 2019 Mr [T] applied to renew his  application  for
    permission  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  all  remaining  grounds,  and
    requested  that  the  application  be  dealt  with  in  oral   hearing.
    Permission was granted on the 13th March 2019 on all remaining  grounds
    by Upper Tribunal Judge Canavan.




    The Second Appellant's Appeal

 6. For reasons unexplained Mrs [M] was not  included  in  the  application
    made by her husband on the 20th January 2018. Rather she  waited  until
    after he had been refused before making her own human rights claim,  on
    the 29th January 2018.

 7. That application was refused on the 21st March 2018.

 8. Mrs [M] appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and the matter came  before
    Designated Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Shaerf.  An application was
    made for Mrs [M]'s appeal to be joined with that  of  her  husband.  By
    this time that appeal had already reached the Upper  Tribunal,  and  so
    could  not  be  joined.  Between  them  Judge  Shaerf  and  Mrs   [M]'s
    representative reached the very pragmatic compromise  that  her  appeal
    would be determined in line  with  the  decision  of  Judge  Mayall  in
    respect of Mr [T]. The appeal was accordingly dismissed.

 9. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  was  refused  on  the  16th
    November  2019  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  MacDonald,  who  quite
    justifiably thought there to be nothing  wrong  with  the  decision  of
    Judge Shaerf. On the 13th March 2019, upon renewed  application,  Judge
    Canavan made an order that Mrs [M]'s appeal was to proceed in the Upper
    Tribunal on the condition that it be joined with that of  her  husband.
    The parties agreed that the eventual outcome  in  her  appeal  was  now
    wholly dependent upon that of her husband.




    The Grounds

10. The Appellant's contend that the decision of Judge Mayall is flawed for
    the following material errors of law:

      i) A failure to  identify  and  direct  himself  to  relevant  burdens
         throughout the determination in accordance with the decisions in SM
         & Qadir (ETS -evidence - burden of proof) [2016]  UKUT  229  (IAC),
         Muhandiramge (section S-LTR 1.7) [2015] UKUT 675 (IAC). The  proper
         approach was  for  the  Tribunal  to  first  consider  whether  the
         Secretary of State had discharged the evidential burden  of  proof,
         then to consider whether the Appellants had  advanced  an  innocent
         explanation for the issue  identified,  and  finally  to  determine
         whether the Secretary of State had  discharged  the  overall  legal
         burden of proof in showing conduct such that a refusal under 322(5)
         was appropriate.

     ii) A failure to identify and direct himself to the  relevant  standard
         of proof in respect of the Appellant's  'innocent  explanation'  in
         accordance with Shen (paper appeals -  proving  dishonesty)  [2014]
         UKUT 236 (IAC). In that case Mr Justice McCloskey  held  that  such
         explanations only need to meet a "basic level of plausibility".  It
         is submitted that the Tribunal in fact imposed a high  standard  of
         proof on the Appellant.

    iii) Errors of Fact. The Appellant submits that the decision  is  unsafe
         for various errors of fact.

     iv)  Failure  to  conduct  an  assessment  of  whether  the   behaviour
         identified justifies refusal under paragraph 322(5).




    Discussion and Findings

    Grounds (i) and (ii): The burden and standard of proof

11. We consider these grounds together because  that  is  how  the  parties
    approached them in their submissions.

12. In SM & Qadir the then President of this  Tribunal  endorsed  a  three-
    stage approach where the Secretary of  State  makes  an  allegation  of
    fraud or deception - in that case in the context of the  use  of  proxy
    test takers.  The three stages are:

    (a)    First, where the Secretary of State alleges  that  an  applicant
         has practised dishonesty or deception in an application  for  leave
         to remain, there is an evidential burden on the Secretary of State.
         This requires that sufficient evidence be adduced to raise an issue
         as to the existence or  non-existence  of  a  fact  in  issue:  for
         example, by producing the  completed  application  which  is  prima
         facie deceitful in some material fashion.

    (b)     The  spotlight  thereby  switches  to  the  applicant.  If   he
         discharges the burden - again, an evidential one -  of  raising  an
         innocent explanation, namely an account which satisfies the minimum
         level of plausibility, a further transfer of the  burden  of  proof
         occurs.

    (c)    Where (b) is satisfied, the burden rests  on  the  Secretary  of
         State to establish, on  the  balance  of  probabilities,  that  the
         Appellant's prima facie innocent explanation is to be rejected.

13. This, the veritable boomerang of the burden of proof,  is  what  in  Mr
    Sharma's  submission,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Mayall  failed   to
    appreciate. The findings start with the sentence: "I regret that I  did
    not find the appellant's evidence to be honest or credible".  Mr Sharma
    questions how that conclusion - the exercise required at  stage  (c)  -
    can lawfully be reached without having first considered stage  (a)  and
    matter (b).  He further submits that all that the Appellant need do  at
    (b) would be to provide an explanation  which  satisfies  the  "minimum
    level of plausibility", and contends that the Appellant was  here  held
    to a more exacting standard.

14. We accept that under the heading 'My Assessment of  the  Evidence'  the
    First-tier Tribunal has not set out this three stage process in  terms.
    It nowhere reaches a formal conclusion that the Secretary of State  had
    discharged the evidential burden  at  stage  (a)  by  pointing  to  the
    discrepancy of �14,000 between the amount declared  for  tax,  and  the
    claimed income relied upon in order to obtain further leave.  Nor  does
    it pause to make findings on whether  the  Appellant,  in  blaming  his
    accountant, has discharged the relatively low burden imposed  upon  him
    at stage (b). It would indeed  have  been  helpful  if  the  'veritable
    boomerang' had  been  set  out  more  clearly.  We  are  not,  however,
    satisfied that this failing is in any way material, for  the  following
    reasons.

15. First, a determination must be read as a whole.  It  is  the  composite
    reflection of the Judge's deliberations. At paragraph 45 we  find  this
    self-direction:

         "It is common ground that the appellant met all of the requirements
         of the rules save for  the  provisions  of  paragraph  276B(i)  and
         (iii). In relation to 276B(iii) it is said that he fell foul of the
         general grounds for refusal set out in paragraph 322(5). It is also
         clear that the burden of proving failure  under  276(i)  and  under
         322(5) lies on the Respondent. The standard of proof is the balance
         of probabilities but I bear very much in mind that where, as  here,
         the allegation against the appellant is of serious  wrongdoing  (in
         effect dishonesty) the more cogent the evidence will have to be  to
         satisfy me to that standard".

16. We are satisfied, having regard to this passage,  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was aware of the  task  before  it.   We  should  be  slow  to
    criticise it for failing to follow its own direction, unless  there  is
    very  obvious  deviation  from  it  once  it  begins  to  express   its
    conclusions.

17. We find no such obvious deviation. In particular we note that Mr Sharma
    was not able to point to any part of the decision where the  Judge  has
    expressed himself in a manner that indicates  that  he  misapplied  the
    relevant burden and standard.

18. Second, because it is uncontroversial that the discrepancy existed, and
    that the Secretary  of  State  had  identified  it.   In  Balajigari  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2019]  EWCA  Civ  673  the
    Court of Appeal held that this in itself was  sufficient  to  discharge
    the initial burden imposed at stage (a) to identify  a  matter  raising
    suspicion: see paragraph 42.  Each party was aware of that,  so  it  is
    understandable that the Tribunal failed to explicitly set that out.

19. Third, because what is apparent from the reasoning overall is that from
    paragraph 50 onward we find the composite assessment of stage (c). Here
    the Tribunal gives detailed and careful attention  to  the  Appellant's
    evidence, itself  a  reflection  of  stage  (b).   His  explanation  is
    rejected for a number of reasons:

      i) It is inherently improbable that a qualified  chartered  accountant
         would erroneously inflate  the  figure  of  �321,  claimed  by  the
         Appellant in expenses, to �14,321;

     ii) The Tribunal did not accept that an accountant would send off a tax
         return without having his client check and sign the document first;

    iii) It is implausible that the Appellant, had he been  asked  to  check
         it, would have  failed  to  notice  the  considerably  reduced  tax
         liability;

     iv) It is difficult to see how such an error could have been made;

      v) The Appellant now states that in actual fact he  only  intended  to
         claim expenses of �321 in his 2011 tax  return,  and  that  he  has
         subsequently declared this figure to HMRC. The Tribunal found it to
         be wholly implausible that this could have been his actual expenses
         for running a business over the  period  of  a  year,  particularly
         where the Appellant's clients were all over the country and he  was
         required to travel. Even if that were not the case and all  of  the
         work was done from home, the 600 hours of claimed work in that year
         would have generated more expenses that that once  one  takes  into
         account internet charges, use of home as office etc.

     vi) The claimed expenses of �321 are further shown to be false  because
         they do not include the accountancy fees;

    vii) In assessing the oral evidence the Tribunal was given the  distinct
         impression that the Appellant was making it up as he went along;

   viii) The Appellant's accounts for a four month period in 2010-2011  show
         an expense claim of �321. It is therefore totally implausible  that
         this would be the same figure for the whole year;

     ix) The Appellant's claim to have undertaken 600 hours of self-employed
         work over the year was utterly implausible given that he also had a
         full time employed position at the time;

      x)  The  explanation  offered  by  the  account  is  simply  that  the
         additional �14,000  in  claimed  expenses  was  inserted  into  the
         Appellant's tax return in a  "typographical  error".  The  Tribunal
         finds this to be singularly lacking in detail, and  notes  that  no
         explanation has been offered as to who made the error, why  it  was
         made and how no-one, including the Appellant himself, picked it up;

     xi) The accountant was not called, despite  the  Appellant  being  well
         aware of the issues;

    xii) The 2011 tax return was amended in early 2016, shortly  before  the
         application was made for indefinite leave to remain.  The Appellant
         denied any connection between those two events and states  that  he
         uncovered the mistake when he was collating documents in  order  to
         apply for funding for a new venture. The Tribunal found that it was
         not immediately apparent why or how the  mistake  would  have  been
         uncovered in those circumstances, and concludes that the timing  is
         suspicious;

20. Whether one reads those reasons  as  a  rejection  of  the  Appellant's
    "innocent explanation" or a positive finding that  the  Respondent  has
    discharged the overall burden of proof, the outcome is the same.

21. We should add that although not pleaded in the  grounds,  in  his  oral
    submissions Mr Sharma contended that the Appellant had not had  a  fair
    hearing, applying the principles in Khan and Balajigari.   He submitted
    that before a final decision was reached, fairness  required  that  the
    Appellant be put on notice of the case against him, so that he  may  be
    given an opportunity to state his case. As support for  his  contention
    that this has not happened here, he pointed  to  paragraph  60  of  the
    determination, where the Tribunal rejects the Appellant's evidence that
    he uncovered the error in 2015 whilst sorting out his paperwork  for  a
    loan application. Mr Sharma submits that had the Judge's  concern  been
    put to the Appellant, he would have been able to produce paperwork from
    the bank confirming that items such as previous tax returns were indeed
    required.

22. We wholly reject the submission that the  Appellant  has  somehow  been
    deprived of a fair hearing, or an opportunity to state  his  case.  The
    principles set out by the Court of Appeal in  Balajigari  were  in  the
    context of a decision of the executive, with far reaching  consequences
    for the individual, being made without notice to  that  individual.  By
    contrast this individual is well aware of the case against him, because
    it has been spelled  out  with  clarity  in  the  Respondent's  refusal
    letter. He then had the opportunity to provide his side of  the  story,
    and meet the forensic challenge, in a full merits-based review in  this
    statutory appeal.

23. Properly understood Mr Sharma's complaint is that  on  that  particular
    issue, the Judge did not tell the Appellant that he regarded the timing
    as suspicious: there was no representative for the  Respondent  at  the
    hearing so no cross examination was conducted on  the  point.   We  are
    satisfied that nothing turns on this. As we have  said,  the  Appellant
    was well aware of  the  case  against  him,  and  that  the  Respondent
    regarded  the  retrospective  amendment  to  the  HMRC  figures  to  be
    suspicious. If he had documents from the banks  in  2015  demonstrating
    that he needed to show them his 2011 tax return, and it  was  his  case
    that it was this requirement that led him to uncover the error, then he
    should have submitted them in the evidence before the Judge. They were,
    on his case, plainly relevant.  It is a matter for the Appellant how he
    wishes to conduct his appeal.

24. Accordingly we are not satisfied that there was any material  error  in
    the overall approach taken by the  Tribunal.  The  Appellant's  appeal,
    insofar as it relates to the deception findings, now  rests  of  ground
    (iii), that there were errors of fact in the determination  capable  of
    rendering those overall findings unsafe.

    Ground (iii): Errors of Fact

25. The first 'error' identified by the grounds  is  in  reality  simply  a
    disagreement with the reasoning. As we note above,  the  Appellant  had
    laid the blame for the erroneous figures supplied to HMRC  in  2011  at
    the door of his accountant, who had duly produced  a  letter  accepting
    responsibility. The First-tier Tribunal found it to be implausible that
    a qualified accountant would submit a  tax  return  without  having  it
    approved by his client. The grounds characterise this as an  'error  of
    fact' on the basis that "this is a common occurrence as is seen by  the
    Tribunal in many cases involving this issue".  In  our  experience,  it
    isn't. Most accountants do ask their clients to check and sign the  tax
    returns prepared by them in draft, for the simple reason that this is a
    fundamental part of their job.  In our view it was manifestly  open  to
    the Tribunal to find that element of the evidence to be implausible.

26. The second error alleged is that  the  Tribunal  misunderstood  at  its
    paragraph 53 the Appellant's evidence in relation to his business.  The
    grounds  read:  "as  an  education-based  business  his  work  schedule
    followed a syllabus-timetable and therefore work was undertaken over  a
    12- month period but only billed over a four month  period".    At  the
    hearing we put Mr Sharma on notice that  we  did  not  understand  that
    pleading. He sought to expand upon it by stating that the Appellant was
    a private tutor at the time, and that he provided services  to  clients
    throughout the educational year but only  billed  them  when  'projects
    were  complete'.   What  projects  a  private  tutor  might  have  been
    completing was not explained. Nor did it appear to be  consistent  with
    the usual practice for private tutors, to bill  clients  by  the  hour.
    Nor, as Judge Owens pointed out, did it appear to  be  consistent  with
    the evidence recorded at paragraph 56 of the determination that some of
    the invoices related to work that had not yet been completed.   We  are
    satisfied that  nothing  turns  on  this  alleged  error,  because  the
    explanations offered were inconsistent, and implausible.

27. The third error of fact is said to be that the Tribunal were  wrong  to
    say that the Appellant had apparently paid nothing in accountancy fees.
    We accept that here the Tribunal does appear  to  have  overlooked  the
    fact that the accounts themselves show �200  claimed  for  'accountancy
    fee'.   This raises the additional problem of making the claimed figure
    of �321 for an entire year of expenses even less  likely  to  be  true.
    The remainder of the figure, according to the accounts,  comprised  �36
    for postage and stationary and only �85 in travel and subsistence for a
    job that allegedly took the Appellant all  over  the  country.  As  the
    Tribunal rightly notes, nothing is claimed for use of home  as  office,
    telephone, internet etc.

28. Even if the Tribunal overlooked the �200 for accountancy fees mentioned
    in the accounts, we are not satisfied that  this  error  in  itself  is
    capable of infecting the overall conclusions.

    Ground (iv)

29. The original grounds as pleaded to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  asserted
    that the Tribunal had failed to make  a  final,  global  assessment  of
    whether any deception, if alleged, would justify refusal under  322(5).
    We firmly reject that contention. The determination takes into  account
    all the factors that would weigh against invoking that  general  ground
    for refusal: the Appellant has lived in this country for a  long  time,
    he now runs a business employing others and with a high  turnover,  his
    child has been born and brought up here, and another  child  tragically
    died and is buried here.  It cannot therefore be said that the Tribunal
    failed to undertake a  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  evidence  in
    accordance with Article 8. Nor can it rationally  be  argued  that  the
    deception was not a serious enough matter to warrant  refusal.  As  the
    First-tier Tribunal puts it:

         "I regard the conduct in this case as being extremely  serious.  It
         is conduct which strikes  at  the  very  heart  of  the  system  of
         immigration control. Without the deceptive  conduct  he  would  not
         have had further leave to remain and would not have established any
         grounds for indefinite  leave  to  remain  on  the  basis  of  long
         residence. It would, without more, seriously undermine  the  public
         interest in maintaining effective immigration  control  if  persons
         were able to take advantage of periods  of  leave  which  had  been
         obtained by such conduct.

         Absent the deception he would  not  have  had  the  opportunity  of
         building up a business in the United Kingdom. It is because of  the
         deception that he was allowed to remain and to forge the successful
         business. It is, in those circumstances,  difficult  to  give  much
         weight to the scales to set against the conduct.

         ...

         In  this  case  the  public  interest  in   maintaining   effective
         immigration control is extremely strong. I take  into  account  the
         matters set out above. I also take into account the distress that I
         have no doubt will be caused by the  family  having  to  leave  the
         burial place of the first child. I do not discount that  factor  at
         all. Given the strength  of  the  public  interest  in  maintaining
