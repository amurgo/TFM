                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Rose (Judge Rose), promulgated on 25 June 2015, in which
    he dismissed the appeal.  That  appeal  was  against  the  Respondent's
    decision of 20 November 2014, refusing to vary leave to remain  and  to
    remove the Appellant from the United Kingdom by way of directions under
    section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. Permission to appeal was  granted  by  Designated  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Garratt on 23 September 2015.

The decision of Judge Rose

 3. The Appellant had sought further leave  to  remain  under  the  Tier  2
    (Intra-Company Transfer: Long Term Staff) provisions of the Immigration
    Rules (the Rules), in particular paragraph 245GD.  The  Respondent  had
    awarded the Appellant 30 points for Sponsorship under Appendix A to the
    Rules, and 10 points for Maintenance  under  Appendix  C.  However,  no
    points had been awarded for Appropriate Salary because the  Certificate
    of Sponsorship (CoS), when accessed at the time of the decision, stated
    the Appellant's salary to be �40,000, and not the minimum of �41,000.

 4. On appeal to Judge Rose, the Appellant had contended that his employers
    (the sponsor) had sought to access the Respondent's Sponsor  Management
    System (SMS) prior to the decision being made in order to  rectify  the
    salary issue. However, it  was  said  that  the  SMS  was  not  working
    properly at the time. In addition, those representing the Appellant had
    written to the Respondent on 5 November 2014  explaining  the  position
    regarding the SMS and the correct salary.

 5. At paragraph 12 of his decision Judge Rose cited  section  85A  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  (the  2002  Act)  and
    concluded that he was precluded from considering any evidence which had
    not in fact been submitted at the precise time the application was sent
    to the Respondent. Therefore, he went on to conclude that  it  was  not
    open to him to have regard to attempts by the Appellant's employers  to
    make changes to the CoS. He duly dismissed the appeal under the  Rules.
    Article 8 was dealt with briefly.

The grounds of appeal

 6. The grounds assert that the Respondent had failed to have regard to the
    letter from the representatives, and that either Rules did not preclude
    changes being made to the CoS, or that discretion for such  changes  to
    be made is routinely exercised in appellants' favour. It is  said  that
    Judge Rose erred in not allowing the appeal outright, or  at  least  to
    the  extent  that  the  Respondent's  decision  was  not  otherwise  in
    accordance with the law.

 7. Judge Roses' conclusion on Article 8 was not challenged.

The hearing before me

 8. Mr Bazini submitted that section 85A of the 2002 Act did not  apply  to
    this scenario at all because the attempted changes to the CoS  emanated
    from the employers, not the Appellant. In any event, if section 85A did
    apply, evidence provided prior to the  decision  being  made  could  be
    considered by the Respondent and, in  turn,  the  Tribunal.  Mr  Bazini
    relied on Nasim and others (Raju: reasons not to follow?)  [2013]  UKUT
    00610 (IAC). The judge had  therefore  wrongly  restricted  himself  in
    respect of the evidence. There were no findings of fact in  respect  of
    the letter and the attempt by the sponsor to access the  SMS  prior  to
    the Respondent's decision.

 9. Mr Clarke submitted that Judge Rose was right to have relied on section
    85A. This was an absolute answer to  the  Appellant's  challenge.  When
    asked about the effect of Nasim, Mr Clarke said that it must be  wrong,
    and the decision in Raju and Others [2013] EWCA Civ 754 was binding  on
    me, as it was on Judge Rose.

Decision on error of law

10. I conclude that Judge Rose did materially err in law.

11. Although I see some  merit  in  Mr  Bazini's  first  point,  I  am  not
    persuaded that section 85A has no application whatsoever in this  case.
    The evidence of the representative's letter and that from the employers
    (such as it was) is in my view caught by section  85A(4)  of  the  2002
    Act. It is in effect evidence adduced by to the Appellant in support of
    his case.

12. However, I conclude that Judge Rose was wrong to find that  the  effect
    of section 85A was, in the  context  of  this  case,  to  preclude  the
    admissibility of any evidence not sent in with the original application
    (as opposed to being sent into the Respondent before the  decision  was
    made). Clearly, Raju was binding on Judge Rose. That decision concerned
    the construction of the Rules as they related  to  the  requirement  to
    provide  specific  qualifications  before  necessary  points  could  be
    awarded (the particular provisions were contained in the fourth part of
    Table 10 of Appendix A to the Rules). The wording of  these  provisions
    was construed as precluding the ability of applicants from  relying  on
    qualifications obtained only after their application had been sent  in,
    notwithstanding  that  the  qualification  was  obtained  and  evidence
    thereof submitted prior to the decision being made.

13. The particular provisions of  the  Rules  with  which  Judge  Rose  was
    concerned did not contain such a temporal restriction.  Importantly,  I
    find that the decision in Nasim specifically says, albeit on an  obiter
    basis, that in  appropriate  cases  (of  which  the  present  is  one),
    evidence submitted after the application is made but before a  decision
    is made can be considered by the Respondent. Paragraphs 72-7  of  Nasim
    state:

         "72.      At  [18]  and  [19]  above,  we  have  recorded  how  the
         respondent's stance before the Upper Tribunal in Khatel relied upon
         section 85A of the 2002 Act, in which Exception 2 was said to  have
         the effect of restricting the  Tribunal  to  the  consideration  of
         evidence, which was submitted in support of, and  at  the  time  of
         making, the application concerned.  We have also seen that,  before
         the Court of Appeal in Raju, the respondent put  her  case  on  the
         substantive requirements of the Rules.  In the present cases,  much
         of Mr Iqbal's skeleton argument was taken up with  an  analysis  of
         section 85A.  In the event, like  the  Court  of  Appeal,  we  have
         resolved the issues before us without reference to the  meaning  or
         effect of section 85A.  Nevertheless, we agree with Counsel for the
         appellants that, in the  circumstances,  it  would  be  helpful  to
         explain why this is so, and in particular, to set out the stance of
         the respondent, both in Raju and before us.

         73.      Paragraph 29 of Mr Gullick's  skeleton  argument  for  the
         respondent in Raju reads as follows:-

             "29.      Whilst the SSHD accepts, having  further  considered
             the position in the light of the  Upper  Tribunal's  judgment,
             that following the coming into force of  section  85A  of  the
             2002 Act, an application is to be treated  as  continuing  for
             evidential purposes after it is  initially  submitted  to  the
             SSHD (and so an applicant can  provide  further  evidence,  in
             addition to that initially  submitted,  prior  to  the  SSHD's
             decision), the question of where  the  cut-off  point  in  the
             'fixed historic timeline' for the award of points should  fall
             is a somewhat different one." (original emphases)

         74.       Mr Gullick's skeleton argument in  the  present  contains
         this paragraph:-

             "41.      It is clear ... that the SSHD has never suggested in
             this appeal that the SSHD is not entitled  to  consider  post-
             submission but pre-decision evidence.  The SSHD has also  made
             it clear that, in any  event,  the  Tribunal  is  entitled  to
             consider the evidence  that  the  decision  maker  considered.
             Such evidence was considered in these cases (and in  the  Raju
             cases), but did not result in the award of 15 points  for  the
             reasons given in Raju." (original emphasis)

         75.      In the light of the  respondent's  position,  there  is  a
         considerable amount of agreement between Mr Gullick and  Mr  Iqbal.
         In particular, they agree on what is meant by the  expression  "the
         application" in section 85A.  They disagree, however, about whether
         section 85A imposes any substantive restriction on the  ability  of
         the respondent to consider evidence submitted  after  the  date  on
         which the application  is  made  for  the  purposes  of  the  Rules
         (pursuant to paragraph 34G).  We agree  with  the  respondent  that
         section 85A imposes no such restriction.

         76.      Accordingly, the respondent's position, in cases  such  as
         the present, is that (as held in Khatel) section  85A  precludes  a
         Tribunal, in a points-based appeal, from considering evidence as to
         compliance with points-based Rules, where  that  evidence  was  not
         before the respondent when she took her decision; but  the  section
         does not prevent a tribunal  from  considering  evidence  that  was
         before the respondent when she took the decision,  whether  or  not
         that evidence  reached  the  respondent  only  after  the  date  of
         application for the purposes of paragraph 34F. Although our view of
         the matter is obiter, we concur."

14. I read Nasim as being consistent  with  Raju.  It  is  clear  from  the
    passages cited above that the Respondent herself adopted a stance which
    allows for the submissions of post-application evidence.  There  is  no
    indication that in  the  time  since  its  promulgation,  the  position
    adopted in Nasim has been shown to be wrong. Given  the  importance  of
    section 85A and  the  admissibility  of  evidence,  it  would  be  very
    surprising if a wholly erroneous view of the law by the Upper  Tribunal
    has been permitted to persist for so long.

15. In light of the above, I reject Mr Clarke's submission that Nasim  must
    be wrong, and I conclude that Judge Rose misdirected himself in law  as
    to the effect of section 85A on the appeal before him.

16. This misdirection was material because it had the  effect  (intentional
    or otherwise) of him failing to make any findings of fact  in  relation
    to the sponsor's attempts to access the SMS and/or the representative's
    letter, both of which were relevant matters. Indeed, there are not even
    any findings as to the existence and  operation  of  the  SMS,  or  the
    practice adopted by the Respondent thereto.

17. All of this in turn had the additional effect of Judge Rose failing  to
    consider the argument that the Respondent's decision may not have  been
    in accordance with the law.

18. For all the reasons set out above, I set aside the  decision  of  Judge
    Rose.

Disposal

19. I have carefully considered what should happen to this appeal  now.  Of
    course, in the normal run of things, the case would remain in the Upper
    Tribunal and the decision would be remade at this level.

20. However, having taken account  of  paragraph  7.2(b)  of  the  Practice
    Statements, and the particular circumstances of this case,  I  conclude
    that remittal to the First-tier Tribunal is the appropriate  course  of
    action. There are no findings  of  fact  at  all  on  several  material
    issues, and it is likely that a significant amount of further  evidence
    relating to the SMS will need to  be  adduced  and  considered  in  due
    course.

21. I therefore remit the appeal back  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  with
    Directions (see below).

Anonymity

22. There is no direction in place and I do not make one at this stage.

Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

I remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

Directions to the parties

      1. The issues in the remitted appeal are: first, whether the Appellant
         can satisfy the relevant Immigration Rules; second, if not, whether
         the Respondent's decision was not otherwise in accordance with  the
         law;

      2. The conclusion of the original First-tier Tribunal on Article 8 has
         not been challenged, and it is preserved.



Procedural Directions

      1. The appeal is remitted to the Hatton Cross hearing centre, to be re-
         listed on a date to be fixed;

      2. The remitted appeal shall not be heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge
         Rose.
