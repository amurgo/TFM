Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr P. Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the respondent:    Mr R. Toal, Counsel, instructed by Wilson Solicitors
LLP

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Secretary of State appeals against the determination  of  First-
       tier Tribunal  Judge  T.R.  Cockrill  promulgated  on  20  May  2016
       allowing the appeal of Mr Andras Tamas against the decision  of  the
       Secretary of State made on 23 February 2016 to  make  a  deportation
       order  against  him  under  the  provisions  of  s.  5  (1)  of  the
       Immigration Act 1971. I shall refer to Mr Tamas as 'the  appellant',
       as he was in the First-tier Tribunal.


    2. The appellant is a Union citizen, a citizen of Hungary, who was born
       on 16 April 1974. He is now 32 years old.

    3. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on 29 March 2006 and, as an
       EEA national, he was not subject to immigration control.  His  entry
       is not recorded. However, the respondent does not  take  issue  with
       the appellant's claim to have entered the United Kingdom in 2006. He
       was then aged 21.

    4. It was accepted by the respondent that he had been  present  in  the
       United Kingdom and exercising Treaty rights for at least 5 years and
       was, therefore, entitled to  a  permanent  right  of  residence  and
       thereby protected against deportation to the extent set out in  reg.
       21 of the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006
       (2006 No 1003):

       Decisions taken on public policy, public security and public  health
       grounds
       This section has no associated Explanatory Memorandum
         21.-(1) In this regulation a "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
       decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public  security  or
       public health.


         (3) A relevant decision may not be taken in respect of  a  person
       with a permanent right of residence under regulation  15  except  on
       serious grounds of public policy or public security.


          (5) Where a relevant decision is  taken  on  grounds  of  public
       policy or public security it shall, in addition  to  complying  with
       the preceding paragraphs of this regulation, be taken in  accordance
       with the following principles-
         (a)   the   decision   must   comply   with   the   principle   of
         proportionality;
         (b) the decision must be based exclusively on the personal conduct
         of the person concerned;
         (c) the personal conduct of the person concerned must represent  a
         genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of
         the fundamental interests of society;
         (d) matters isolated from the particulars of  the  case  or  which
         relate to considerations of general prevention do not justify  the
         decision;
         (e) a person's previous criminal convictions do not in  themselves
         justify the decision.
         (6) Before taking a relevant decision on the  grounds  of  public
         policy or public security in relation to a person who  is  resident
         in the United Kingdom the  decision  maker  must  take  account  of
         considerations such  as  the  age,  state  of  health,  family  and
         economic situation of the person, the person's length of  residence
         in the United Kingdom, the person's social and cultural integration
         into the United Kingdom and the extent of the person's  links  with
         his country of origin.


    5. In sum, the test was serious grounds of public policy.


    6. On 2 December 2014 the appellant was arrested  by  the  Metropolitan
       Police. The circumstances of his  arrest  were  that  he  was  found
       asleep in his vehicle with some �4,000 in  cash.  It  was,  however,
       later accepted by the Secretary of State that he was  in  possession
       of this cash lawfully in that it was rent  that  he  had  collected.
       The search also revealed an amount of drugs (the quantity  of  which
       is not recorded), a crack pipe found in the driver's door  of  which
       the appellant claimed  to  be  ignorant  and  a  calibrated  balance
       'capable  of  very  fine  weighing'  as  used  for  weighing   small
       quantities of drugs which  the  appellant  apparently  explained  by
       reference to its use in  making  pastry  [106].   In  addition,  the
       search revealed a kitchen knife, the presence of which the appellant
       explained by saying it was 'just to make  sandwiches'  [107]  and  a
       baseball bat.

    7. He was charged with four offences: (1) possession  of  an  offensive
       weapon in a public  place;  (2  and  3)  possession  of  a  Class  B
       controlled  drug  amphetamine  and  cannabis  respectively  and  (4)
       possession of a Class A controlled  drug,  cocaine.  The  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge was simply wrong in saying that no further action was
       taken in relation to those various matters; indeed,  they  were  the
       subject  of  convictions  that  took  place  at  North  East  London
       Magistrates Court on 28 April 2015. Insofar  as  he  considered  'it
       highly pertinent to point out that no further action was taken',  he
       gave the  appellant  the  benefit  of  this  comment  to  which  the
       appellant was not entitled.  No charges were brought in relation  to
       the knife.  Without sight of it, no inferences can  be  drawn  about
       it, notwithstanding the overall context in which it was  found.   Mr
       Toal described it - I assume the blade - as being 8 cms long.


    8. It is of considerable significance to record the sentences that were
       imposed.  For possession of an offensive weapon - the baseball bat -
       the appellant was sentenced to a community order to  perform  unpaid
       work; for the two offences of possession of Class B  drugs,  he  was
       fined �100 on each and for possession of Class A drugs he was  fined
       �500.

    9. It is on the basis of these 2015 convictions that the  Secretary  of
       State sought to establish there are serious grounds of public policy
       justifying his removal notwithstanding his having a permanent  right
       of residence and his presence in  the  United  Kingdom  since  2006.
       The Secretary of State attempts this by reference not  only  to  the
       2015 convictions but also to three convictions incurred  in  Hungary
       in 2001.

   10. Turning first to the 2015 convictions, the appellant was not charged
       with possessing drugs with the intent to supply. Whatever  may  have
       first appeared, once it was established that  the  �4,000  was  rent
       that the appellant had collected, the quantity of drugs (the  amount
       is not recorded) was not such so as to infer  the  appellant  was  a
       dealer and the fines imposed do not suggest  otherwise.  Whilst  the
       presence of a balance might suggest its use in dealing, it was  also
       consistent with a purchaser intent on checking  the  amount  of  his
       purchase.  The  crack  pipe  was  consistent   with   personal   use
       notwithstanding his lame explanation that he  was  ignorant  of  its
       presence in the driver's door.

   11. The most serious offence was his possession of an offensive  weapon,
       especially in the context of his being a rent collector,  suspicions
       of the utmost gravity springing  to  mind.   In  dealing  with  this
       offence, the First-tier Tribunal Judge was plainly influenced by the
       appellant's explanation [39],


         The appellant had said that he had had the  baseball  bat  in  the
             vehicle for his own protection. To put the matter in  context,
             the appellant, as earlier indicated, had been collecting  rent
             and he had the bat to deal with anyone trying to assault  him.
             He was to expand on that point later by  saying  that  he  had
             been the victim of one incident where he had been attacked but
             that matter had not been reported to the police. The  sentence
             of the court was of course a non-custodial sentence.


   12. This explanation sits uncomfortably with the judges recital  of  the
       appellant's evidence set out in paragraph 77 of the determination


         He acknowledged that his baseball bat was in  the  vehicle  behind
             the seat. He obtained that bat from a tenant who had moved out
             and the bat  had  been  left  behind  in  that  property.  The
             appellant could not say specifically  why  it  had  been  left
             behind the passenger seat. He had  not  used  the  bat  in  an
             offensive way. He had not threatened anyone with  it.  It  was
             put to him that he had explained that he had it  for  his  own
             protection. The appellant's reply was to repeat the  point  as
             to the circumstances under which he came  into  possession  of
             this bat.


   13. Pausing there, it was necessary to approach  this  matter  with  the
       certain realism. First, the appellant had given what appears  to  be
       two different accounts as to the reason why is that was in the  back
       of his vehicle: one, for his own  protection;  the  other,  that  he
       could not really say why he had it.  Second, persons who  have  been
       the victim of an earlier attack are  not  thereafter  sanctioned  to
       carry baseball bats to protect themselves against subsequent attacks
       and do not usually do so. (The appellant did not appear to me to  be
       unusually vulnerable to attack.)  Third, if the possession  of  this
       offensive weapon was specifically related  to  his  job  as  a  rent
       collector, rent  collectors  do  not  as  a  rule  have  to  protect
       themselves  against  their  tenants  -  even  those  who  pay   rent
       irregularly - by having a baseball bat. Fourth,  the  possession  of
       this bat was expressly found by a criminal court to have amounted to
       the possession of an offensive weapon. If,  as  the  appellant  also
       suggested, this was simply an item that had been left  behind  by  a
       departing tenant, no reason was given as to why it should  find  its
       way into the back of the appellant's vehicle.  Offensive weapons are
       not proscribed because they have been used  for  acts  of  violence.
       There are other offences known to the law if unlawful use  has  been
       made of such weapons.  They are proscribed because of the  potential
       for such harm; particularly so, where violence is likely or  tempers
       are raised.  Hence, the Judge's comments in relation to the knife  -
       but equally applicable in relation to the baseball bat - that 'there
       is  no  shred  of  evidence  at  all  to  show  that  it  was   used
       aggressively' misses the point entirely.


   14. These considerations do not  appear  to  have  entered  the  Judge's
       thinking in his determination and he appears to  have  accepted  the
       appellant's explanations without  further  analysis,  concluding  in
       paragraph 132 by saying somewhat benignly: 'he  was  caught  with  a
       baseball bat in his vehicle'  and  in  paragraph  144  that  it  was
       retained in his van for 'the purposes of his  own  protection'.   In
       paragraph  142,  the  Judge  comes  precious  close  to  offering  a
       justification for possessing an offensive weapon


             Because of the nature of the work I can quite see that they
    will come in           contact with tenants who are unwilling to co-
    operate fully...


       However, he draws  away  from  what  would  have  been  an  unlawful
       conclusion by adding


             ...and of course the appellant must not  misuse  his  position
    and use force


         But omitting to ask what was the purpose of having a baseball  bat
       in relation to tenants who did not co-operate with  his  demands  or
       paid irregularly.


   15. It is apparent that the Judge took a benign view of the  appellant's
       conduct in possessing this baseball bat.


   16. However, for the reasons I have given, the Judge was not entitled to
       conclude (even of balance of probabilities) that the  appellant  was
       dealing in drugs.  Indeed, I doubt if this was even suggested by the
       respondent.  Whilst implausible answers given by the appellant about
       his knowledge of  a  crack  pipe  in  the  vehicle  or  the  risible
       explanation that the calibrated balance was used for  making  pastry
       amply demonstrate that the appellant was not telling the truth, that
       did not permit the Judge to conclude  on  balance  of  probabilities
       that he was a dealer.

   17. It is impossible to see that  possession  of  a  (presumably  small)
       quantity of drugs on a single occasion for personal use can  justify
       removal on serious grounds of public policy.

   18. The analysis then had to assess  a  further  vital  element  of  the
       appellant's past. On 26 April 2001 before  the  Municipal  Court  in
       Budapest, the appellant was convicted of three offences.  The  first
       was the illegal  possession  of  a  firearm.   The  second  was  the
       possession of controlled drugs. The third was an offence of robbery.
       For these offences he was sentenced  to  8  years  imprisonment.  No
       distinction is made in the record as  to  the  individual  sentences
       imposed for each of the three offences. The offences took  place  on
       15 November 1997, now some 19 years ago.

   19. It is safe to assume that these offences came to  the  attention  of
       the UK authorities as a result of his arrest or conviction  for  the
       offences in December 2014.

   20. The appellant provided what, on its face, was an entirely improbable
       explanation for his being convicted. He explained that  he  came  to
       know two individuals in the gym he attended who asked the  appellant
       if they might use his flat for "business". He  was  told  that  they
       wanted to sell a car and needed somewhere  convenient  to  sign  the
       contract.  No  credible  explanation  was  given  as  to   why   the
       appellant's flat was  necessary  for  such  a  simple  purpose.  The
       appellant claimed that he did  not  know  the  other  party  to  the
       transaction to all and that the potential car  purchaser  brought  a
       friend with him. A  fight  ensued  at  his  flat  between  the  four
       visitors at which point one of them drew a gun and killed one of the
       potential purchasers. The appellant claimed he  reacted  immediately
       by grabbing the gun from  the  assailant  which  he  managed  to  do
       thereby leaving him, literally, in possession of the smoking gun. He
       also  noticed  that  there  was  a  bag  of   amphetamine   tablets.
       Presumably, and to his surprise, it  was  at  this  stage  that  the
       appellant suddenly saw the light and that this was  not  a  contract
       for the sale of the motor car but a drug deal.


   21. The others fled. Rather than notify the police as to what had  taken
       place the appellant (who was, according to him, entirely innocent at
       this stage of any wrongdoing), retained possession of both  the  gun
       and the drugs which the Hungarian police subsequently found  in  his
       possession.  Hence his admission to the possession of drugs and  the
       firearm, according to him, relate solely to  his  having  innocently
       assumed possession of both after the murder and  the  abortive  drug
       deal.


   22. The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  described  this,  (again  somewhat
       benignly), as a deal that went  'tragically  wrong',  although  that
       would not have been my description of the event.

   23. The appellant maintained this implausible account before the  First-
       tier Tribunal Judge who appears to have accepted  it  on  the  basis
       that he had been immature, naive and very stupid.  Although  he  had
       denied robbery, he had  been  convicted  by  the  court.  The  judge
       records at paragraph 22

         The appellant acknowledged that what had  really  taken  place  in
             relation to the gun was that he  possessed  it,  nothing  more
             than that. He had become involved in  what  was  in  effect  a
             joint enterprise concerning the robbery, and that was  why  it
             would appear that the court had convicted him in Hungary.


       And then at paragraph 129


         The appellant accepted his imprisonment.  He did not  dispute  the
             matter of robbery by saying he was not involved but was  found
             guilty by the  court,  presumably  on  an  analysis  of  joint
             enterprise or equivalent.

   24.  Whilst  this  is  an  example  of  accepting  the  most  favourable
       interpretation of events advanced by the appellant, it is wrong.  It
       is belied by the appellant's conviction on his not-guilty plea of an
       offence of robbery and by the fact that the totality of  his  wrong-
       doing merited 8 years imprisonment.  There is no record of an appeal
       against either conviction or sentence.  There is no suggestion of  a
       miscarriage of justice (in relation to which the appellant would  be
       required to provide cogent evidence).  The  Judge's  twice  repeated
       reference to 'joint-enterprise' does not assist the appellant.   Had
       this been a joint-enterprise,  the  appellant  would  have  been  as
       guilty of robbery as his fellow robbers.  On the appellant's account
       of  events,  he  was  entirely  innocent  of  any  act  of  violence
       associated with a charge of robbery.  Hence, on  the  state  of  the
       evidence, it was not open to the Judge to depart from  the  fact  of
       the conviction or the fact  that  the  conviction  merited  8  years
       imprisonment.  It was on any view very serious wrongdoing.


   25. Appearing to justify taking the most favourable view of events,  the
       Judge emphasised his early release for good  conduct.   Whilst  this
       was a matter that the Judge  was  properly  entitled  to  take  into
       account, the Judge's assessment contains  a  short  reference  to  a
       substantial sentence which is then immediately followed by


         ...but I think it is  highly  pertinent  given  the  criteria  for
             assessment of the appellant's situation which focuses  on  his
             conduct that he was described as  an  exemplary  prisoner  and
             gained early release in the way that he has described. That is
             of course enormously to his credit.


   26. Following Secretary of State for the Home Department v.  Straszewski
       [2015] EWCA Civ 1245 (Moore-Bick, Davis and Sharp LJJ),  the  burden
       rests firmly with the Secretary of State and the enquiry is directed
       to whether the future risk that the community faces  is  a  genuine,
       present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the
       fundamental interests of society by reason of the  appellant's  past
       wrong-doing.  The issue is whether the appellant's conduct, taken as
       a whole, establishes  a  propensity  to  offend.   The  respondent's
       burden does not require  that  it  is  discharged  by  reference  to
       specific reports from the authorities  which  are  directed  to  the
       issue of re-offending, the equivalent of an OASys report, probations
       reports  or  a  judge's  sentencing  remarks.   Rather,  it  is   an
       evaluation that requires an holistic approach.

   27. The First-tier Tribunal Judge clearly attached great weight  to  the
       absence of particulars surrounding the offence:

         126.... it is particularly important to stress that no  particulars
             whatever have been provided by the respondent that tell me the
             circumstances of these offences.

   28. If this amounts to a criticism of the respondent for her failure  to
       produce the type of material which directly addressed  the  risk  of
       offending such as  might  be  found  in  appeal  brought  against  a
       deportation appeal when a Union citizen is convicted of  an  offence
       in the United Kingdom, the criticism is unjustified.  In the case of
       a deportation order based on a conviction in a foreign  country,  it
       is not a requirement that such material, if it exists, is abstracted
       from the local prosecution, judicial or  probation  authorities  and
       then translated.  Instead, the Tribunal has to apply the  structured
       approach set out in the provisions  of  reg.  21  and  to  make  its
       decision on the material before it.  I accept that, were  it  to  be
       necessary as a matter of law, then the  fact  that  the  process  is
       onerous (requiring corresponding  with  the  local  court  or  local
       police in a language both parties might understand or  communicating
       with the national authorities via the Embassy) would be no excuse.


   29. The First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  did  not  hear  evidence  from  the
       appellant that was consistent with his conviction for robbery.   The
       appellant's account could only be  construed  as  a  denial  of  his
       involvement with robbery.  The sentence of 8  years  could  only  be
       construed as consistent with a  serious  offence  of  robbery.   The
       absence of further particulars about the offence was not capable  of
       permitting the appellant to provide a version  of  events  that  was
       inconsistent with the verdict and the sentence unless the  appellant
       established there has been a miscarriage of justice.  The  appellant
       adduced no evidence as to a flawed process which had resulted in his
       being wrongly convicted or sentenced to  a  period  of  imprisonment
       which did not reflect the gravity of his offending.

   30. In seeking  to  justify  the  appellant's  removal,  the  First-tier
       Tribunal heard evidence from the Secretary of State in  relation  to
       other matters adverse to the appellant but which had not resulted in
       any criminal conviction. It was lawful for the  respondent  to  rely
       upon such additional matters. However, as  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge properly pointed out,  the  material  was  equivocal  for  the
       reasons he gave and it was open to him to attach little weight to it
       as part of the task required of him to  assess  whether  there  were
       serious grounds of public policy sufficient to justify removal.


   31. I have been at pains to point out the way in  which  the  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge appeared  to  have  marginalised  or  minimised  some
       elements of the case which had been mounted against  the  appellant.
       In my judgment, he should have viewed the events in 1997 as properly
       reflected in the convictions. Absent a  credible  justification  for
       the appellant's conviction for robbery, he could place no weight  on
       the appellant's attempts to spin  a  thoroughly  incredible  account
       that he was an innocent bystander to a robbery  or  his  involvement
       with firearms and drugs.  The Judge's reliance on the  Secretary  of
       State's failure to provide full particulars of the offences did  not
       justify the Judge's acceptance of an account which was  inconsistent
       with the convictions when no evidence of a  miscarriage  of  justice
       was advanced; all the more so when the account provided was scarcely
       credible and the appellant's account of  the  circumstances  of  his
       later convictions in 2015 were not, in part, credible [144].

   32. Had the Judge approached the 1997 offences as  he  should,  he  must
       have approached those offences as ones  of  the  gravest  character.
       Indeed, firearms, drugs and violence are the scourge of our  society
       and merited a clear statement to that effect.  I do not find this in
       the  determination  and  the  Judge's  reference  in  [130]   to   a
       substantial sentence is immediately neutralised by reference to  his
       good behaviour in prison as 'enormously to his credit'.

   33. Yet the fact remains that even if the Judge  had  properly  examined
       the 1997 convictions, these events had taken place 19 years  before,
       well over half his lifetime ago.  In the meantime, there had been no
       repeat offending apart from the single  occasion  in  December  2014
       when the offences which  triggered  the  deportation  decision  took
       place.  If the decision  maker  or  the  Tribunal  strips  away  the
       possession of drugs for  personal  use  which  cannot  significantly
       contribute towards establishing serious  grounds  of  public  policy
       (but which I emphatically do not condone), there remains the offence
       of possessing an offensive weapon for which the appellant received a
       community order.  Just as  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  is  not
       permitted (without proper  justification)  to  go  behind  the  2001
       convictions and sentence, nor can I go behind the  2015  convictions
       and sentence.  These reflect, at  least  as  a  starting-point,  the
       nature and gravity of the offence.  Most importantly,  they  do  not
       establish involvement in the supply of, or dealing in,  drugs.   Nor
       does the evidence establish  intimidation  and  violence  in  either
       supplying drugs or the collection of rent.


   34. A comparison between the  earlier  offending  and  the  more  recent
       offences bears close examination. First, both include involvement in
       the illegal possession of drugs. Second, and more  worryingly,  both
       include acts of violence or  the  potential  use  of  violence;  the
       violence implicit in a robbery, the potential violence  implicit  in
       possessing an offensive weapon. Third, in each  case  a  weapon  was
       involved; a gun or a baseball bat. If,  as  a  result  of  a  proper
       examination of the facts, the appellant was involved in drug dealing
       in 1997 which resulted in violence using a weapon and was then found
       to have been involved in  drug  dealing  in  circumstances  where  a
       weapon was readily accessible, either a kitchen knife or a  baseball
       bat then it would have been open to the Judge to find that,  despite
       the passage of time, the appellant has not altered  his  ways.  This
       was simply a case of history repeating itself. In  that  event,  the
       appellant was a hoodlum in Hungary and has continued to be so in the
       United Kingdom albeit there are no known intervening  incidents.  On
       the strength of such reasoning, it would have been open to the Judge
       to conclude the risk continues. Indeed, he may have been obliged  to
       make such a finding.


   35. However,  the  evidence  simply  is  not  capable  of  drawing  that
       conclusion.  The evidential link between  the  events  of  1997  and
       those of 2014, when combined together, do not establish the  serious
       grounds of  public  policy  required  under  the  2006  Regulations.
       Without this, the 2014 offences do not  justify  removal  given  the
       appellant's otherwise lawful presence in the  United  Kingdom  as  a
       Union citizen since 2006.


   36. It is  impossible  to  overlook  the  serious  suspicions  that  the
       appellant's conduct has given rise to: large amounts of cash, drugs,
       an offensive  weapon,  a  knife,  calibrated  scales,  the  possible
       implication of the use of violence or  intimidation  in  pursuit  of
       unpaid rent or in his dealings with other people.  Whilst they  fall
       short of establishing that the appellant is  a  threat  to  society,
       they suggest a life on the fringe.  If (and the Secretary  of  State
       may well say that it is  not  if  but  when)  these  suspicions  are
       supported  by  credible  evidence  of  criminal   wrong-doing,   the
       appellant will indeed be shown to be a threat.  He should be  in  no
       doubt of the consequences of this.  By then, of course, he may  well
       have established a presence in the United Kingdom in  excess  of  10
       years and entitled to the greatest level of protection, namely  that
       afforded by reg. 21 (4) of the 2006 Regulations, imperative grounds:




         (4) A relevant decision may not be  taken  except  on  imperative
         grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-
              (a) has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous  period
of at least ten            years prior to the relevant decision

   37.  Were that stage to be reached in the case of a violent drug  dealer
       or rent collector  using  improper  force,  the  threshold  test  of
       imperative grounds will easily have been made out and the  appellant
       will be removed.   On the other hand, if the  appellant  has  indeed
       led a blameless and worthwhile life since his release  from  prison,
       he must forgive the imputation  of  unworthy  conduct  and  consider
       himself misunderstood.

DECISION

     The Judge made no material error on a point of law and the original
determination of  the appeal shall stand.
