                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer.
For the Respondent:    Mrs M A Hodgson, Counsel.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant in this case is the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department. However, for the sake for clarity, I shall use  the  titles
    by which parties were known before the  First-tier  Tribunal  with  the
    Secretary of State referred to as "the  Respondent"  and  Miss  Ugwoka,
    [MU] and [FU] as "the Appellants".

 2. The Appellants are citizens of Nigeria.  The  first  Appellant  is  the
    mother of the second and third Appellant. The first  Appellant,  having
    entered the United Kingdom  pursuant  to  valid  leave  as  a  student,
    applied  for  her  circumstances  to  be  considered  outside  of   the
    Immigration Rules. On 10 September 2015 the Respondent made a  decision
    to refuse the application for leave  to  remain  on  the  grounds  that
    removal would not place the United Kingdom in breach of its obligations
    under the Human Rights Act 1998. It is against that decision  that  the
    Appellants appealed. It was heard at Taylor House  and  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 2 November 2016 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Ghaffar
    dismissed the immigration appeals of the first  and  third  Appellants,
    allowed the immigration appeal of the second Appellant and allowed  the
    human rights appeals of all three Appellants.

 3. The Respondent sought permission to appeal. On 1 April  2017  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Frankish granted that application. His  reasons
    for so doing were:-

         "1.  In a decision promulgated on 2  November  2016  F-tTJ  Ghaffar
             allowed appeals,  the  first  appellant  having  entered  as  a
             student, against refusal of leave to remain under the Rules for
             appellant 2 and all three under article 8 outside of the Rules.

         2. The application for permission to appeal  asserts:  overemphasis
            on the children's private  life  rather  than  the  "real  world
            setting" per EV (Philippines) (2014) EWCA Civ  874  and  not  to
            have taken account of the parental immigration  history  per  MA
            (Pakistan) (2016) EWCA Civ 705 i.e. a totally  UK  child-centred
            assessment with no regard to reconstitution of private life  and
            education in Nigeria; lack of regard to cultural connections  as
            well as a brother still in  Nigeria  including  the  main  focus
            still  being  within  the  family  and  the  first   appellant's
            employment prospects in the  home  country  as  a  midwife/staff
            nurse; no reason  given  for  risk  of  FGM  especially  as  the
            mother/first appellant is against and it is a federal offence in
            the home state; lack of regard to the burden on the public purse
            given that the first appellant depends  on  others  rather  than
            being financially independence for the past 3 years.

         3. Arguably, the finding under the Rules (�22) underplays  cultural
            heritage and family reunion back  home,  the  key  factor  being
            merely the absence of attendance at a  Nigerian  Roman  Catholic
            chaplaincy in the UK. That is also  the  basis  of  the  finding
            (�28) under article 8 outside of the Rules. Arguably,  there  is
            no basis for the unsupported finding that  the  third  appellant
            "faces the risk of Female Genitalia Mutilation in  the  area  to
            which she would have to live were she required to be returned to
            Nigeria.""

 4. Thus the appeals came before me today.

 5. Mr Whitwell began his submissions by handing up three decisions which I
    have taken into account and which both representatives referred me  to.
    They are MA (Pakistan) and Ors, R  (on  the  application  of)  v  Upper
    Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) and Anor [2016] EWCA Civ 705,
    E-A (Article 8 - best interests of child)  Nigeria  [2011]  UKUT  00315
    (IAC) and PD and others (Article 8 - conjoined family claims) Sri Lanka
    [2016] UKUT 00108 (IAC).

 6. He relied on the Respondent's grounds seeking permission to appeal  and
    sought to identify material errors  within  the  Judge's  decision.  In
    particular that at paragraph 16  and  17  the  Judge  has  inadequately
    reasoned his findings that the third Appellant  would  be  at  risk  of
    Female Genitalia Mutilation  in  Orlu,  Nigeria  and  that  the  second
    Appellant has a diagnosis of autism. The FGM issue has to  be  seen  in
    the context of paragraph 10 of the Judge's decision and the failure  of
    the first Appellant to explain why an asylum claim had not been made on
    behalf of the third  Appellant  based  upon  this  fear.  The  decision
    records the second Appellant being investigated for autism and like the
    issue of Female Genitalia Mutilation there is no  reasoning  given  for
    the conclusions the Judge has come to. At paragraph 18 of  the  Judge's
    decision a  conclusion  is  made  that  there  are  "no  insurmountable
    obstacles to returning to Nigeria as a family unit". This does not  sit
    well with paragraph 28 of the Judge's decision and  the  finding  there
    that it would "not be reasonable to expect them to leave the  country".
    The Judge's error is equating the issue of "reasonableness"  with  that
    of the "best interest" of  the  children.  The  best  interest  of  the
    children should have been factored into the  reasonable  test.  Further
    the Judge's decision is entirely absent of a  "real  world"  assessment
    and erroneously adopts a "solely child centric analysis". There  is  no
    consideration of whether the private lives of  the  Appellants  can  be
    reconstituted within their returning country.

 7. Mrs Hodgson urged me to accept that no  "irrationality"  can  be  found
    within the Judge's decision. That the Home Office Presenting Officer at
    the First-tier Tribunal hearing did not argue the  "real  world"  issue
    and that the Respondent  today  has  failed  to  highlight  any  public
    interest factors that should have been considered  and  were  not.  The
    Judge was aware of all such factors but because of the strong links  of
    the third Appellant to the United Kingdom was entitled to come  to  the
    conclusion  that  he  did.  Albeit  that  the  first  Appellant  had  a
    precarious status she argued that it was settled law that that did  not
    render the second and  third  Appellants  status  precarious  too.  The
    grounds are an attempt to put forward arguments  that  should  properly
    have been put at the First-tier Tribunal hearing and did not amount  to
    material errors. The Judge took  into  account  the  first  Appellant's
    "cultural nexus" with Nigeria but despite that was entitled to come  to
    the decision that he did. The Respondent's "best argument"  relates  to
    that of FGM. However despite this the Judge was entitled to come to the
    findings and con conclusions that he did.

 8. In coming to my decision I have  taken  into  account  the  authorities
    referred to and particularly the  parts  therein  highlighted  by  both
    representatives. These include paragraph 41 of PD which states:-

         "Furthermore, we must weigh the third Appellant's  best  interests,
         as we have assessed them,  which  have  the  status  of  a  primary
         consideration. The main countervailing factor is that the first and
         second Appellants have no legal  right  to  remain  in  the  United
         Kingdom. Their immigration status is that of unlawful over-stayers.
         This is a  factor  of  undeniable  weight.  However,  it  has  been
         frequently stated that a  child's  best  interests  should  not  be
         compromised on account of the misdemeanours of  its  parents.  See,
         for example, per Baroness Hale in  ZH  (Tanzania)  v  Secretary  of
         State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 4, at [20]-[21] and  [35]
         and EM (Lebanon) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
         [2008] UKHL 64, at [49]. Having regard to our predictive finding of
         the most likely future scenario for this family, we  consider  that
         there is a preponderance of factors  impelling  to  the  conclusion
         that it would not be reasonable to expect the  third  Appellant  to
         leave the United Kingdom. Accordingly, his  appeal  succeeds  under
         the Rules."

 9.   Paragraph 29 of E-A which states:-

         "We are satisfied that there was a material misdirection, and  that
         analysis of the best interests of the children entirely through the
         prism of the right to education was too  narrow  an  approach.  The
         error might well be a material one  and  we  will  accordingly  set
         aside the decision and remake it  in  the  light  of  the  evidence
         before the judge and the submissions made to us."

10. And from MA paragraph 46:-

         "Even on the approach of the Secretary of State, the  fact  that  a
         child has been here for  seven  years  must  be  given  significant
         weight when carrying out the proportionality exercise. Indeed,  the
         Secretary of State published guidance in August 2015 in the form of
         Immigration Directorate Instructions entitled "Family  Life  (as  a
         partner or parent) and Private Life: 10 Year Routes" in which it is
         expressly stated that once the seven years'  residence  requirement
         is satisfied, there need to be "strong reasons" for refusing  leave
         (para. 11.2.4). These instructions were not in force when the cases
         now subject to appeal were determined, but in my view  they  merely
         confirm what is implicit in adopting a policy of this nature. After
         such a period of time the  child  will  have  put  down  roots  and
         developed social, cultural and educational links  in  the  UK  such
         that it is likely to be highly disruptive if the child is  required
         to leave the UK. That may be less so when  the  children  are  very
         young because the focus of their lives will be on  their  families,
         but  the  disruption  becomes  more  serious  as  they  get  older.
         Moreover, in these cases there must be a  very  strong  expectation
         that the child's best interests will be to remain in  the  UK  with
         his parents as part of a family unit,  and  that  must  rank  as  a
         primary consideration in the proportionality assessment."

11. I am satisfied that Judge Ghaffar has materially erred. He  has  failed
    to adequately reason why he came to the  conclusions  that  he  did  in
    relation to both the issues of  autism  and  FGM.  He  has  misdirected
    himself in law when considering this appeal  and  has  failed  to  take
    account of the above mentioned authorities. Irrespective of whether the
    Home Office Presenting  Officer  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing
    referred to them it was incumbent upon the  Judge  to  take  them  into
    account when deciding this appeal.  His  decision  is  absent  a  "real
    world" assessment and his reasoning is inadequate  on  all  the  issues
    identified by Mr Whitwell.

12. Both representatives were of the view that if I found  material  errors
    as asserted by the Respondent this appeal should  be  remitted  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for further fact finding on all issues.

Conclusion

13. The making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
    making an error on a point of law.  The  decision  is  set  aside.  The
    appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal, to be dealt with afresh,
    pursuant to Section 12(2)(b)(i) of the Tribunal, Courts and Enforcement
    Act 2007 and Practice Statement 7.2(b), before  any  Judge  aside  from
    Judge Ghaffar.

No anonymity direction is made.
