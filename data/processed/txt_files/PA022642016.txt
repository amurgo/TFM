                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW

Anonymity

1.    This appeal is subject to an anonymity order made  by  the  First-tier
      Tribunal. Neither party invited me to rescind the order. I continue it
      pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
      2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended).





Introduction

2.     The  Appellant  is  a  national  of  Afghanistan.  He  appeals   with
      permission against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge M A  Khan
      (hereafter "the Judge") promulgated on 2 September 2016 dismissing his
      appeal against the Respondent's  decision  to  refuse  his  protection
      claim.

Background

3.    The background to the Appellant's claim can be summarised as  follows.
      The Appellant claims that he was persecuted by Muslims as  a  Sikh  in
      Afghanistan. He claimed that his family home was burgled, his  sister-
      in-law was raped and his father killed. He left Afghanistan and joined
      his brother and family in the UK. The Appellant fears  persecution  on
      return to Afghanistan on account of his Sikh ethnicity. The Respondent
      did not accept the Appellant  had  been  persecuted  and  refused  the
      claim.

The Decision of the Judge

4.    The Judge set out the Appellant's case  between  [16]  and  [21],  the
      contra case between [22] and [23], made reference to the evidence  and
      submissions between [25] and [45] and set out his conclusions  between
      [46] and [71]. The consideration of the  parties'  positions  and  the
      evidence is comprehensive.


5.    The Judge concluded that the Appellant's account was not credible  and
      that his credibility was  undermined  by  his  behaviour  contrary  to
      Section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.)
      Act 2004. The Judge noted various inconsistencies in the  account  and
      concluded that it was fabricated ([46]-[51]). The Judge found that  he
      was not assisted by the evidence of  the  Appellant's  brother  and  a
      further witness, noting in particular that he had  not  been  provided
      with the evidence relied upon by the brother in his asylum claim,  and
      that, the evidence of the witness was a recital of what  he  had  been
      told by the Appellant and  his  brother  [52].  The  Judge  considered
      relevant Country Guidance  and  concluded  that  the  Appellant  could
      safely return to Afghanistan.


6.    In summarising his conclusions the Judge stated thus at [57]:


           "As it has been previously stated in case  law  that  each  case
           depends on its merits (sic).  In  this  case  I  find  that  the
           appellant's credibility is totally discredited. On the  evidence
           before me, the appellant is totally lacking in  credibility.  He
           has made up his story about the Taliban trying to force  him  to
           join them and has over exaggerated his claimed  fear......"  (My
           Emphasis)


7.    The Judge thus concluded  that  the  Appellant  was  not  entitled  to
      international protection.


8.    The Judge proceeded to  consider  the  appeal  on  Article  8  grounds
      outside of the Rules and concluded that the Respondent's decision  was
      proportionate  at  [76],  finding  that  family  life  had  not   been
      established between the Appellant and his brother and his family.  The
      Judge had regard to the Appellant's recent engagement to his  fiancï¿½e;
      a British citizen originally from Afghanistan. He noted that  she  had
      lived in Afghanistan until the age of 9 or 10 years old, and concluded
      that she could accompany the Appellant to Afghanistan should she  wish
      and where he could protect her [63]. Accordingly, the Judge  dismissed
      the appeal on human rights grounds also.


 Permission to Appeal

9.     The  Appellant  appealed  against  that  decision  and  was   granted
      permission  to  appeal  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Kelly  on  19
      September 2016. The grounds upon which permission was granted  may  be
      summarised as follows:

      (i)   It is arguable  that  the  reference  in  the  decision  to  the
      Appellant being forcibly recruited by the Taliban, which did not  form
      any part of his case, may suggest, if for this reason alone, that  the
      Tribunal failed to  give  the  Appellant's  protection  claim  anxious
      scrutiny; and


      (ii)  It is arguable that the Tribunal made a flawed assessment of the
      Appellant's claim that his removal  would  be  contrary  to  the  UK's
      obligation under Article 8 of the ECHR.


10.   There is a Rule 24 response from the Respondent opposing the appeal.

Decision on Error of Law

Preliminary issue

11.    The  First-tier  Tribunal  in  its  grant  of  permission  to  appeal
      considered that the grounds were unarguable save for the reasons given
      in paragraphs 7, 8, 10 and 11  of  the  application  (now  grounds  of
      appeal) upon which permission was expressly granted. Mr  Karim  sought
      to renew the application for permission to appeal in respect of  those
      grounds upon which permission had not been granted. He referred to the
      decision in Ferrer (limited appeal grounds; Alvi)  [2012]  UKUT  00304
      and indicated that the First-tier Tribunal had not in compliance  with
      the procedure rules issued a notice informing the  Appellant  that  he
      may apply to the Upper Tribunal for permission to appeal arising  from
      the First-tier Tribunal's decision on any ground on  which  permission
      has been refused, thereby denying  the  Appellant  an  opportunity  of
      renewing his application to the Upper Tribunal.  Ms  Brocklesby-Weller
      did not object to the renewed application and I heard submissions from
      the representatives on whether to grant permission and indicated  that
      I would reserve my decision which I now give.

12.   In reaching my decision I have borne in mind  the  guidance  given  in
      Ferrer (supra) in that my task in deciding whether to grant permission
      is not merely to review the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  on  the
      application. In considering the grounds of application I am  satisfied
      that the grant of permission should be varied so as to make clear that
      the reasons given in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the grounds of  application
      are arguable.

13.   I do not find in favour of the Appellant in respect of  the  remaining
      reasons given in the application at paragraphs 2, 3,  and  6  for  the
      reasons given by Judge Kelly in  refusing  permission  in  respect  of
      those paragraphs, which I agree with and adopt in this decision.

14.   Turning then to the grounds upon which permission has been granted  it
      makes sense to deal first with the reasons set out at paragraph 10  of
      the grounds. Mr Karim submitted that the Judge's  reference  to  facts
      not  relating  to  the  Appellant's  claim,  set  out  at  [6]  above,
      demonstrated that the Judge had failed to give anxious scrutiny to the
      Appellant's case and in this respect invited the Tribunal to  consider
      the decision of the Court of Appeal in ML (Nigeria)  [2013]  EWCA  Civ
      844. That decision happened to involve the  same  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge as the instant case, but I do not  accord  any  weight  to  that
      circumstance. Further, I recognise that there is scope  for  decisions
      to contain slips and  errors  without  it  inevitably  constituting  a
      material error of law. The significance of any such factual errors  is
      a matter for evaluation  and  judgement  on  a  case  specific  basis,
      bearing in mind the requirement of 'anxious scrutiny' imposed upon the
      Judge and the entitlement of the parties to a fair hearing.

15.   It is clear from the decision in ML (Nigeria)  that  the  decision  of
      the First-tier Tribunal in that appeal contained serious errors  which
      were identified by the Court of Appeal in its judgment. One such error
      identified was where a paragraph was inserted (see paragraph 7 of  the
      Court of Appeal  decision)  referring  to  the  EPDP  threatening  the
      Appellant and him being attacked and a reference was made to  the  Sri
      Lankan authorities in that paragraph. That paragraph had nothing to do
      whatsoever with the Appellant and appears to have been  inserted  from
      another case. I acknowledge that that error is similar  to  the  error
      committed in this case.

16.   Whilst it is  the  position  that  a  series  of  factual  errors  may
      constitute an error of law, it  is  plain  that  the  errors  must  be
      material or significant to the overall conclusions (see  paragraph  10
      of the decision of ML (Nigeria)). It is common ground that  the  Judge
      referred in his conclusionary paragraph at [57]  to  some  details  in
      respect of the Appellant's claim wrongly. However, it is further plain
      that when reaching a  decision  upon  the  Appellant's  evidence,  his
      evidence was considered and assessed  upon  his  correct  history  and
      evidence at [46]-[53]. There is no dispute that this assessment of the
      evidence related quite properly to the Appellant's claim. At [46]-[51]
      the Judge set out various inconsistencies in the Appellant's  account.
      There  is  no  dispute  that  the  Judge  correctly  referred  to  the
      Appellant's evidence and the matters contained within the  documentary
      evidence. Contrary to the assertion made by Mr Karim that the  mistake
      of fact at [57] coloured the Judge's approach of  the  credibility  of
      the Appellant, it is plain that the Judge assessed the evidence  given
      by him. There is no suggestion whatsoever that in that assessment  the
      evidence was based on a wrong assumption of the  history  but  on  the
      correct evidence given by the Appellant. Thus I do not find that  that
      ground is made out.

17.   However in all of the particular circumstances of this  case,  I  find
      that the errors identified below are such that it cannot be  concluded
      that the Appellant received a fair hearing, and that consequently  the
      decision must be set aside for error of law.

18.   The Judge erred in the following respects:

      (i)   Paragraph 4 of the grounds contend that the Judge failed to
      apply extant Country Guidance by failing to adopt a fact sensitive
      approach in its consideration of whether the Appellant's religious
      profile placed him at real risk of persecution on return. In TG and
      others (Afghan Sikhs persecuted) Afghanistan CG [2015] UKUT 00595
      (IAC) the Tribunal inter alia stated thus:


           "(iii)      A consideration of whether an individual  member  of
           the Sikh and Hindu communities is at risk  real  of  persecution
           upon return to Afghanistan is fact-sensitive. All  the  relevant
           circumstances must be considered but careful attention should be
           paid to the following:


           a.  women  are  particularly  vulnerable  in  the   absence   of
              appropriate protection from a male member of the family;


           b. likely financial circumstances and ability  to  access  basic
              accommodation bearing in mind


               - Muslims are generally unlikely to employ a  member  of  the
                 Sikh and Hindu communities


               - such individuals may face difficulties (including  threats,
                 extortion,  seizure  of  land  and  acts  of  violence)  in
                 retaining  property  and  /  or  pursuing  their  remaining
                 traditional pursuit, that of a shopkeeper / trader


               - the traditional source of support for such individuals, the
                 Gurdwara is much less able to provide adequate support;


           c.  the  level  of  religious   devotion   and   the   practical
              accessibility to a suitable place  of  religious  worship  in
              light of declining numbers and the evidence  that  some  have
              been subjected to harm and threats to harm  whilst  accessing
              the Gurdwara;


           d. access to appropriate education  for  children  in  light  of
              discrimination  against  Sikh  and  Hindu  children  and  the
              shortage of adequate education facilities for them."


           (My Emphasis)

      And at [108] said this:

           "Some may claim that when attempting to access the  Temple  they
           are subject to ill-treatment or  the  threat  of  ill-treatment.
           Whether this is sufficient to found a claim may depend upon  the
           nature of the alleged difficulties, the location of  the  Temple
           and its surroundings, the level of devotion  of  the  particular
           individual,  the  importance  of  religious  identity   to   the
           individual concerned,  and  whether  the  alleged  ill-treatment
           realistically  prevents  such  a  person  from   attending   and
           undertaking worship.  Were a Sikh or Hindu credibly claims  that
           they are unable to attend the Temple and that such attendance is
           an important aspect of their religious identity, and the  reason
           for this is a credible fear of serious harm  or  the  threat  of
           serious harm, then consideration should  be  given  to  this  in
           accordance with Y&Z (supra)."


      (ii)  Whilst the Judge referred to head note (ii) in TG at [55]  which
      held that there  was  no  general  risk  per  se  to  Sikh  and  Hindu
      communities in Afghanistan on the basis of their ethnic and  religious
      identity, he failed to consider the guidance set out above in light of
      the Appellant's evidence that he was a practising  Sikh  with  a  high
      level of religious conviction: see the Appellant's  witness  statement
      at paragraph [16]. The Tribunal's Country Guidance was binding on  the
      Judge and his decision is absent  any  factual  consideration  of  the
      Appellant's religious devotion and whether that  would  place  him  in
      difficulties on return. Such a consideration I find was distinct  from
      any findings of fact the Judge made  as  to  the  credibility  of  the
      Appellant's account of past persecution.


      (iii) Paragraph 5 of the grounds  contend  that  the  Judge  erred  in
      discounting the evidence of  the  Appellant's  brother  who  had  been
      recognised as a refugee and who corroborated the Appellant's claim. Mr
      Karim submitted that the Judge failed to  engage  with  the  brother's
      evidence and that inadequate reasons were given  for  discounting  the
      same. The Judge dealt swiftly with the brother's evidence at [52]  and
      stated, "The  appellant's  brother's  evidence  does  not  assist  the
      appellant's claim as I have not been provided with the  evidence  upon
      which he relied on  for  his  asylum  claim  and  succeeded."  (I  was
      informed that the  Appellant's  brother  was  granted  refugee  status
      without the need for an appeal  hearing).  The  difficulty  with  this
      conclusion is that it provides no analysis of the  evidence  that  was
      before the Judge. That evidence comprised of a witness  statement  and
      the oral evidence of the brother ([38]-[40]).  In  MK  (duty  to  give
      reasons) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 00641 (IAC) the Tribunal held inter alia
      that: "(2) If a  tribunal  finds  oral  evidence  to  be  implausible,
      incredible  or  unreliable  or  a  document  to  be  worth  no  weight
      whatsoever, it is necessary to say so in  the  determination  and  for
      such findings to be supported by reasons.  A  bare  statement  that  a
      witness was not believed or that a document was afforded no weight  is
      unlikely to satisfy the requirement to give reasons." I find the Judge
      failed in that duty.


      (iv)  For the reasons given in paragraphs 7, 8 and 11 of the  grounds,
      I am satisfied that the Judge's assessment of the Appellant's  Article
      8 claim is flawed. The Judge failed to adequately assess the  evidence
      of the Appellant's fiancï¿½e in respect of her reasons  as  to  why  she
      could not live with the Appellant in Afghanistan and, whether  it  was
      reasonable to expect her now to leave the  UK.  No  consideration  was
      given to her evidence that she was a child when she  left  Afghanistan
      or to the ties she has to her UK based family ([43]-[37]).


      (v)   The Judge further failed to consider the  Appellant's  alternate
      case as put by Mr Karim pursuant to  paragraph  276ADE  of  the  Rules
      [45].


19.   Although there is some coherency  to  other  aspects  of  the  Judge's
      adverse assessment of the Appellant's credibility (as there was in  ML
      Nigeria) - I am  not  persuaded  that  it  is  such  that  the  errors
      identified above can be considered to be of insignificant  consequence
      and that an adverse decision in the appeal is inevitable - albeit,  as
      in ML Nigeria, the Appellant may face "a very difficult run".


20.   It is not necessary to make any specific Directions  for  the  further
      conduct of the appeal. Both parties are at liberty to file any further
      evidence upon which they seek to rely up to 7 days prior  to  the  re-
      listed hearing.





Decision


21.   The Appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.


22.   The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is infected  by  legal  errors
      and is set aside.


23.   The decision in the appeal is  to  be  remade  before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal by any judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge M A Khan.
