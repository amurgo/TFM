Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Mustafa, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is  a  citizen  of  Bangladesh.  She  applied  for  entry
    clearance as the spouse of  a  British  citizen.  Her  application  was
    refused by the respondent on 2 April 2018. Her appeal was dismissed  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Geraint Jones QC ("the FTTJ") in  a  decision
    promulgated on 15 January 2019.


 2. No anonymity direction was made in the First-tier Tribunal and none  is
    required.


Background

 3. The appellant's application was refused by the respondent on  one  sole
    ground: she had not provided all the required documentary evidence,  as
    specified in Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration  Rules,  to  demonstrate
    her spouse earned in excess of �18,600 per annum. The  application  was
    refused by reference to paragraph  E-ECP.3.1  of  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules.


 4. In her application, and at the hearing before the FTTJ,  the  appellant
    conceded that she  had  not  provided  all  the  specified  documentary
    evidence required by Appendix  FM-SE.  However,  she  asserted  that  a
    reasonable explanation had been provided for the absence of  the  three
    documents in question and that  alternative  documentary  evidence  had
    been provided in their stead.

 5. The FTTJ dismissed the appeal on the grounds that the appellant had not
    provided the specified evidence to demonstrate the  sponsor  earned  in
    excess of the financial earnings threshold. The appellant  was  granted
    permission to appeal to this Tribunal. Hence the matter came before  us
    to decide whether the decision of the FTTJ contains a material error of
    law.

Submissions

 6. Mr  Mustafa,  for  the  appellant,  reiterated  that  three  particular
    documents had been missing from the appellant's  application  and  that
    these related to the sponsor's earnings outside the UK;  these  missing
    documents (and the reasons for their absence) had been explained in the
    covering letter sent to the respondent with the appellant's application
    for  entry  clearance.   Mr  Mustafa  referred  to   the   respondent's
    Immigration Directorate Instruction which  contained  guidance  on  the
    application of  Appendix  FM-SE,  specifically  paragraph  3.4.3  which
    related to  evidential  flexibility:  "There  is  also  discretion  for
    decision-makers where evidence cannot be supplied  because  it  is  not
    issued in a particular country  or  has  been  permanently  lost."   He
    observed that this guidance had been cited in the grounds of appeal  to
    the First-tier Tribunal yet the FTTJ had failed to address the  claimed
    failure of the respondent to exercise his discretion.


 7. Mr Bramble, for the respondent, had not been provided with  appellant's
    bundle which had been before the FTTJ.  That bundle included a copy  of
    the  covering  letter,  dated  6  March  2018,  which  accompanied  the
    appellant's application form and set out the reasons for the absence of
    the three documents in support of the application.   Having  considered
    the appellant's bundle,  including  the  covering  letter,  Mr  Bramble
    accepted the respondent had had a  discretion  which  could  have  been
    taken into account.  He accepted also that the appellant  had  provided
    evidence of the sponsor's employment at the Doha Academy and  that  his
    earnings from that source equated to �2,172.94. He  also  accepted  the
    sponsor had adduced evidence (albeit not in  the  format  specified  in
    Appendix FM-SE) of earnings from his  employment  by  Dasman  Bilingual
    School  equivalent  to  �17,102.   He  accepted   that   the   evidence
    demonstrated the sponsor had earned the equivalent of �19,274 and  that
    this exceeded the financial threshold of  �18,600.  He  conceded  that,
    taking into account the availability of a  discretion  under  paragraph
    D(e) of Appendix FM-SE, the appellant had demonstrated, at the date  of
    decision, she met  the  maintenance  requirements  in  the  Immigration
    Rules.  He observed that this was the sole reason for refusal and  that
    the application should have been allowed.


Discussion


 8. We are grateful to Mr Bramble for the clarity of his  submissions.   We
    accept them and find that the decision of the FTTJ contained a material
    error of law in that he failed to take into account,  when  considering
    the documentary evidence before him, the existence of the  respondent's
    discretionary power.  We set aside the decision  of  the  FTTJ  in  its
    entirety.

 9. We remake the FTTJ's decision and find that the appellant demonstrated,
    at the date of decision, that  she  met  the  maintenance  criteria  in
    Appendix  FM.  This  was  the  sole  reason  for  the  refusal  of  her
    application.

10. This is a human  rights  appeal;  given  that  the  appellant  met  the
    criteria in the Rules for the grant of leave to remain, and there being
    no other issues of concern to the respondent, it is not  arguable  that
    the public interest in the maintenance of effective immigration control
    outweighs the degree of interference in this couple's and their child's
    protected rights to a family life together (OA  &  Ors  (human  rights;
    "new matter"; s120) Nigeria [2019] UKUT 65).

Decision

11. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  a
    material error of law, as set out above.


12. We set aside that decision.

13. We remake the decision in the appeal by allowing  it  on  human  rights
    grounds.

Fee Award

The FTTJ did not make a fee award. As the appeal has been allowed,  we  have
considered making such an award and  make  a  full  fee  award  because  the
respondent  failed  to  consider  exercising  his   discretion   under   the
evidential flexibility provisions in the respondent's guidance. Had he  done
so, or reviewed his decision  appropriately,  this  matter  would  not  have
proceeded to appeal.
