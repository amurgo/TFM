Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Miss L McCrorie, of Loughran & Co, Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Parties are as described above, but  the  rest  of  this  determination
    refers to them as they were in the FtT.

 2. The appellant identifies himself as a Kurdish citizen of Iraq, born  in
    1994.  He speaks Kurdish Sorani.

 3. The appellant claimed as follows.  He is from [a] village in (or  near)
    the city of Tuz Khormato [an ethnically mixed  area]  in  Salah  Al-din
    Province.  Arab men in his village tried to recruit  him  to  ISIS.  He
    reported this to the peshmerga, who arrested one of the men.   A  month
    later, shots were fired at his family home.  He would be at risk if  he
    returned home. He could not move to the IKR, due to  a  tribal  dispute
    which led his father to leave there before the appellant was born.

 4. The respondent's decision of 23 November  2016,  refusing  that  claim,
    runs thus:

         �13-22. The appellant gave  a  poor  and  evasive  account  of  his
         origins, such that his credibility was damaged and nationality  and
         identity could not be "verified".  It was not accepted that  he  is
         from the area he claimed, but it was accepted that he is Iraqi  and
         Kurdish.

         �23-30.  The claimed approach from Isis was vague and incredible.

         �31-37.  The allegation of a tribal  dispute  or  blood  feud,  and
         inability to relocate to IKR, was also rejected.

         �38-39.  Failure to claim in  France  was  adverse  to  credibility
         under section 8 of the 2004 Act.

         �43-46.  Under reference to AA Iraq CG [2015] UKUT 00544,  even  if
         his home area was in a contested area, as  a  Kurd,  regardless  of
         origin, the appellant could relocate to Erbil or elsewhere  in  the
         IKR.

         �47-52.  Alternatively, the appellant could relocate to Baghdad, or
         via Baghdad.

         �53-57.  The  claim  failed,  for  similar  reasons,  in  terms  of
         humanitarian protection and of articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR.

         �58.  There was no reason to grant leave in  terms  of  family  and
         private life, exceptional circumstances,  or  in  the  exercise  of
         discretion.

 5. FtT Judge Hands allowed the appellant's  appeal  by  decision  dated  5
    January 2017.

 6. The judge records submissions from the SSHD that Salah Al-din was  not,
    on up-to-date information, a contested area  (�24(e));  and  from  Miss
    McCrorie that there was an unsafe level of violence there (�26(b)).

 7. For reasons given at �34 - 47, the judge found that the  appellant  had
    not established his claims about an approach from ISIS, a  blood  feud,
    or his travel to the UK, and that on return he would be of  no  adverse
    interest to the Iraqi or Kurdish authorities or ISIS.  At �43 she  said
    that the appellant had "not established that  he  does  originate  from
    Salah Al-din."

 8. Under the heading "humanitarian protection" at �48-52  the  judge  said
    that both parties accepted the situation had  changed  since  AA.   She
    cited at length from a UNHCR report of November 2016, and continued  as
    follows:

         "51.     The appellant ... would ... not have the skills or support
         or sponsorship to enable him to establish a life should  he  choose
         to remain in Baghdad. Travelling from Baghdad to his home area will
         be fraught  with  difficulty  given  it  would  involve  travelling
         through some of the areas still contested. His home  area  has  not
         been established but is identified by the  UN  as  being  insecure,
         having been retaken from Isis ... Although he has  not  established
         that he is entitled to protection under the Refugee  Convention  he
         does not fit into the category of person who  can  be  returned  to
         Iraq because of the current insecurity  ...  in  the  northern  and
         central  region  and  inability  to  obtain  ...   employment   and
         accommodation in Baghdad. Further,  the  increasing  insecurity  in
         Baghdad as found by the  UNHCR  would  indicate  that  any  Kurdish
         person  arriving  there  would  not  find  themselves  in  a   safe
         environment because of the deterioration in law and order and level
         of indiscriminate violence he would face.

         52.       Therefore,  I  find  the  appellant   is   eligible   for
         humanitarian protection."

 9. The SSHD's grounds of appeal to the UT are on these lines.   The  judge
    having given full reasons why the appellant is not a refugee  erred  by
    relying upon a UNHCR report to depart from the country guidance  in  AA
    without adequate  reasons;  UNHCR  do  not  apply  the  relevant  legal
    criteria for assessment of risk, and their reports are not to  be  read
    as if they did.

10. Mr Matthews accepted that the grounds are not drawn  as  accurately  as
    they might have been, but he submitted  that  they  were  a  basis  for
    identifying error, as follows.  The  decision  letter  clearly  if  not
    specifically contemplates that the appellant may well be from the  IKR.
    The judge appears to agree.  In any event, it was for the appellant  to
    prove any case based on a specific area of origin, and he failed to  do
    so.  The judge plainly contradicted herself between �43 and �51,  where
    she repeated her finding that the appellant  had  not  established  his
    home area, yet went on to decide the case as if he had.  The judge made
    no attempt to show that information before the  judge  from  UNHCR  was
    different in nature from reports considered in AA and other cases.  The
    information  was  not  different.   UNHCR  has  been  advising  against
    enforced returns to Iraq for many years,  before  and  since  AA.   The
    respondent's case in the refusal decision was firstly about  return  to
    the IKR, not to Baghdad.  The judge was not entitled  to  ignore  that.
    She assumed that removal would be  to  Baghdad,  for  no  reason.   The
    decision should be set aside and remade.  That could take place in  the
    UT or by remit to the FtT, to the same or to another judge,  but  based
    on the findings of fact, which were not challenged  by  the  appellant,
    made on the individual claim.

11. A rule 24 response to the grant of permission argues for the  appellant
    that the FtT's decision is justified in terms of  the  findings  in  AA
    about relocation in  Baghdad.   Miss  McCrorie  submitted  along  those
    lines, and further as  follows.   Both  parties  had  filed  up-to-date
    evidence which the judge was entitled to consider about  the  situation
    in Salah Al-din province.  She was right to take as her starting  point
    that there was such insecurity that  the  appellant  could  not  return
    there.  There was recent evidence before the judge not only from  UNHCR
    but also from Amnesty International.  Although the judge looked at  the
    evidence, her findings were justified in any event  by  the  guidelines
    stated  in  AA.    If  the  case  required  a  further  decision,   the
    appellant's case was that there had been ample  evidence  that  he  was
    from the area he claimed.  The relevant findings should  be  reassessed
    in any further decision.  It was accepted that  the  rule  24  response
    said nothing about the  adverse  credibility  findings,  but  that  was
    because it was framed in response to the grounds and to  the  grant  of
    permission.

12. Having reserved the case for consideration, I  issued  my  decision  on
    error of law, and gave directions, along the  lines  of  the  following
    paragraphs, �13 - 22.

13. The SSHD's grounds are rather clumsily put, in  a  way  which  has  its
    origins in a misleading and unnecessary feature of the decision.

14. The grounds look for  a  debate  about  whether  the  UNHCR  guidelines
    justify departure from country guidance, when the judge's consideration
    on close inspection bears to be decided within the guidance, if it  was
    right to treat the case as turning on relocation in Baghdad.

15. The terms of the report from UNHCR  do  seem  to  be  no  different  in
    substance from material which was before the UT when deciding AA.   The
    appellant set out no comparison of materials to that  effect,  and  nor
    did the judge.  But that is not the real issue which emerged  from  the
    grounds and submissions.

16. The grounds yield an inevitable finding that the decision  of  the  FtT
    errs in law, by failing to give any adequate reason why  the  appellant
    is entitled to a grant of humanitarian protection.

17. The clear finding at �43 of the FtT decision, quoted above, is repeated
    at �51 but departed from in the same sentence  for  no  reason  stated.
    The appellant did not suggest any reason which might be read in.

18. There is no explanation why the case is found to turn on relocation  to
    Baghdad, rather than on removal to the IKR (or of why  removal  to  the
    IKR might be taken to involve relocation, rather than return).

19. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

20. Rule 24 requires a statement of any grounds  upon  which  a  party  was
    unsuccessful in the FtT but upon which he intends to rely  in  the  UT.
    Although a rule 24 response was filed for the appellant, it included no
    such statement.   No  reason  had  been  advanced  for  revisiting  the
    credibility findings  adverse  to  the  appellant  (and  no  error  was
    apparent in those findings).

21. In terms of the Practice  Statement  for  the  Immigration  and  Asylum
    Chamber of the Upper Tribunal, paragraph 7, the decision was apt to  be
    re-made in the UT, by way of further submissions.

22. Both parties were directed to file and to copy to each other, not  less
    than 7 days  prior  to  the  next  hearing,  a  note,  outlining  their
    respective cases on the further decision which should be reached by the
    UT, referenced to the  judge's  findings,  country  guidance,  and  any
    relevant evidence which has been filed.

23. Both parties filed written submissions prior to the further hearing  on
    24 May 2017.



The appellant's case on remaking the decision.

24. The note and  submissions,  which  were  fully  supported  by  detailed
    references to the evidence and case law, may be outlined thus:

      i. The appellant has demonstrated that he is from [a village], part of
         Tuz Khurmatu in Salah al-Din province.

     ii. His account is corroborated as to the ethnically diverse nature  of
         the area, the presence of a mosque  and  of  a  hospital,  and  the
         journey time to Kirkuk, and speaking Kurdish Sorani.

    iii. Tuz Khurmatu and Salah al-Din province remain a contested area.

     iv. He cannot be removed to Salah al-Din province.

      v. He is not a former resident of the IKR,  so  any  proposed  removal
         would be to Baghdad.

     vi. He has no current or expired passport  or  laissez  passer  and  so
         cannot be removed to Baghdad.

    vii. He has no CSID and cannot  obtain  one.   He  cannot  approach  the
         Embassy without jeopardising his  claim.   He  cannot  contact  his
         family as he does not have a number and does not  know  where  they
         are.

   viii. Lack of family support implies risk of  destitution  and  qualifies
         for protection.

     ix. He cannot obtain a CSID because his  home  area  is  contested  and
         because he would be unable to prove his identity.

      x. He cannot relocate to Baghdad due  to  having  no  CSID  and  being
         unable to obtain one; being  unable  to  speak  Arabic;  having  no
         family friends or other sponsor; and being of the Kurdish and Sunni
         minorities.

     xi. He cannot relocate in the IKR as he is not from there, and  due  to
         familial and financial constraints, the risk of travel, and absence
         of assistance.

    xii. BA [2017] UKUT demonstrates risk in Baghdad as a Sunni, a  Kurd,  a
         non-Arabic speaker, etc.

   xiii. The appellant cannot go to his home area, to the IKR, to Baghdad or
         anywhere else.

    xiv. R (on the application of H)  v  SSHD  [2017]  UKUT  00119  requires
         consideration of the circumstances, as above.

     xv.  The  appellant  establishes  a  need  for  protection  on  Refugee
         Convention grounds; or under article 2 and 3 ECHR; or  humanitarian
         protection; not excluded by either  sufficiency  of  protection  or
         internal relocation.

The respondent's case on remaking.

25. The respondent submitted thus:

      i. The appellant failed to establish that he is from [a village],  Tuz
         Khurmatu, or anywhere in Salah al-Din province.

     ii. No case has  been  made  for  revisiting  the  adverse  credibility
         findings.

    iii. In any event, there is no apparent error  in  those  findings.   On
         that basis, the appellant has not been  found  truthful  about  his
         fear of ISIS; his family's involvement in a tribal dispute or blood
         feud in the IKR; his means of travel to the UK; or his origins.

     iv. The appellant said he had lost his passport and had no other  Iraqi
         identity documents.  There was no  express  finding  in  the  FtT's
         decision, but no reason to treat these matters in his favour.

      v. The FtT found that the  appellant  does  have  access  to  identity
         documents at �44, which clearly implied a finding that he does have
         contact with his family in Iraq.

     vi. Having failed to show that he is from [a village],  it  would  defy
         logic to find that the appellant is from any contested area.

    vii. The basis on which to decide the case is that the appellant is  not
         from a contested area.

   viii. The appellant may be from the IKR, or alternatively it would not be
         unreasonable to expect him to relocate there.

     ix. If the appellant did have to travel to the IKR via  Baghdad,  there
         was no reason why he might not do so.

      x. There was no basis on which to find that  the  appellant  would  be
         without employment, family support, identity  documents,  or  funds
         (made available by the respondent; cf.  AA at �79).

     xi. Flights are available from Baghdad to Erbil.

    xii. There were no grounds to depart from AA, which on the  findings  of
         fact of the FtT required the outcome to be reversed.

Conclusions.

26. Miss McCrorie has pressed the case for the appellant as strongly as the
    evidence would bear, both in the FtT and in the UT.  However, the  case
    on remaking the decision is entirely dependent on reversing the adverse
    credibility findings of the FtT.

27. No reason has been shown to revisit those findings.

28. In any event, the FtT's reasons for those findings are plainly sound.

29. On the evidence before the FtT, I  would  have  had  no  difficulty  in
    reaching similar findings for similar reasons.

30. Once the error into which the FtT fell at �51 is eliminated,  there  is
    nothing by which it might be found that the appellant  has  established
    entitlement to protection.

31. The respondent's analysis of that issue is accurate.

32. The appellant fails to establish that he is from a contested  area,  so
    his case does not turn on internal relocation.

  33. The guidance in AA is set out at paragraph 204 and headnote 20, thus:

         "Whether a Kurd, if returned to Baghdad, can reasonably be expected
         to avoid any potential undue harshness in that city  by  travelling
         to the IKR, will be fact sensitive; and is  likely  to  involve  an
         assessment of (a) practicality of travel from Baghdad  to  the  IKR
         (such  as  to  Erbil  by  air);  (b)  the  likelihood  of  securing
         employment in the IKR; and (c) the availability of assistance  from
         family and friends in the IKR."

34. Even if the case did turn on relocation to the IKR, there is no  reason
    to hold that the appellant would not be able to do so.

35. The FtT erred at �51 by treating the further alternative of  relocation
    in Baghdad as decisive of the case, when on the findings that  was  not
    an outcome which the appellant faced.

36. It is at least doubtful whether the FtT's finding  that  the  appellant
    could not resettle in Baghdad  can  be  justified,  given  its  earlier
    conclusions on the primary facts;  but  as  the  alternative  does  not
    arise, there is no need to analyse that further.

37. An anonymity direction was made in the FtT,  although  there  does  not
    appear to be any  particular  reason  for  one.   The  matter  was  not
    addressed in the UT, so anonymity has been preserved.

38. The following  decision  is  substituted:  the  appeal,  as  originally
    brought to the FtT, is dismissed.
