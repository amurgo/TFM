                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. On the 12th September 2012 the determination  of  a  Panel  of  the
        First-tier Tribunal, which allowed the appeal of  Mr  Hadi  against
        the decision of the Secretary of  State  to  deport  him  from  the
        United Kingdom, was set aside for the following reasons:


              11. In a detailed determination the panel find that Mr Hadi, a
   Dutch               national, has been in the  United  Kingdom  for  over
   five years and set               out the  correct  test  to  be  applied;
   namely that his removal is  justified                on  the  grounds  of
   public    policy,    public    security    or    public     health     in
   accordance  with  Regulation  21  of  the   2006   Regulations   and   in
     particular that the 'serious threat' threshold is reached.
              12. The test for me to consider is whether the conclusions  of
   the panel               are ones reasonably open to them on the evidence.
              13. In relation to those findings it  is  submitted  that  the
   panel misdirected                themselves at paragraph 29, as stated in
   the grant of permission to                appeal, as the  relevant  issue
   was  to  establish  whether  there  is  a                     pattern  of
   offending   and   if   so   what   this   indicates   about   Mr   Hadi's
   conduct. I find having considered all the evidence that this  is  a  case
          in which there is a history of repeated criminal  conduct  from  a
   very                young age with the nature of the offences showing  an
   escalation in                 violence.  There  also  appears  to  be  an
   underlying financial reason and               the panel  failed  to  give
   adequate reasons for  why  they  concluded                 there  was  no
   pattern   of   offending   as   a   result   of   which   they   possibly
   concluded they did  not  need  to  consider  what  this  indicated  about
     Mr Hadi's conduct.
              14. There  appears  to  be  no  recognition  of,  or  adequate
   findings made, in                relation to the assessment that the risk
   of offending was imminent if                  Mr Hadi found he could make
   financial gain which is a material                 error.
              15. The conclusions at paragraph 29, where the panel  set  out
   the  issues                    they  took  into  account  when  assessing
   whether Mr Hadi was a                      person  who  has  changed  his
   ways,  are  quite  selective  and   in   some                    respects
   speculative  and   not   supported   by   the   evidence   available   to
   the panel. It is in this respect  that  the  panel  failed  to  make  any
          findings on the fact Mr  Hadi  had  been  issued  with  a  warning
   letter,                 referred to in paragraph 19 of  the  reasons  for
   deportation letter, and                   that since  2009  he  has  been
   aware that further offending may result                in deportation. He
   has   in   fact   been    convicted    of    three    further    offences
   since that date yet the factors referred to by the panel  do  not  appear
          to have been issues that prevented reoffending and  undermined  Mr
          Hadi's claim to be genuinely remorseful.
              16. I also note what appears to be  a  contradiction  in  that
   paragraph 40,                when assessing the Secretary of State's view
   on public interest the                panel state "we  were  referred  to
   the seriousness of the appellant's                  offence  and  had  we
   also find that there is a risk of reoffending, that                  risk
   is one facet of the  public  interest  to  be  taken  into  account  when
      assessing  the  consequences  of  a  serious   offence   having   been
     committed". In paragraph  52  the  panel  find  that  although  he  has
     committed criminal offences in the past it  has  not  been  established
          that he is a credible risk of further criminal activities.
              17. It is not clear whether in  paragraph  40  the  panel  are
   finding that                 there is a risk of  reoffending  or  stating
   that had they found there was                 a risk of  reoffending  the
   following consequences would be  relevant.                    If  it  was
   found   there   was   a   risk   of   reoffending    the    finding    at
   paragraph 52 that there was no credible risk is a direct contradiction.
              18. In any event having considered the case in detail, I  find
   that Mr Mills                has discharged the burden of proof upon  him
   to the required                       standard to  show  that  the  panel
   made a material error of law for the               reasons set out in the
   application for permission to  appeal  and  the                 grant  of
   permission   in   relation   to   both   their    assessment    of    the
   deportation decision and Article 8. In respect of Article 8  although  it
          is accepted that Mr Hadi has family and private life in the United
                  Kingdom it was clearly  material  to  the  proportionality
   exercise                     conducted that the panel had found  that  he
   was able to succeed in                his appeal against the  deportation
   decision.
              19. Accordingly I find that the  determination  of  the  panel
   must be set                  aside and the decision re-made.  Other  than
   the finding that Mr Hadi                  is a Dutch national who  has  a
   permanent right of residence in the                United Kingdom,  which
   is not challenged in the grounds,  there  shall                    be  no
   preserved findings.



Procedural history


     2. It emerged at the hearing on 12th September 2012 that Mr  Hadi  had
        been arrested for further  drug  offences  although  had  not  been
        charged at that time. Directions were given for a  further  hearing
        at which Mr Hadi was directed to being with him  any  documents  he
        received from the Police or Crown Prosecution Service.


     3. On 29th April 2013 the Upper  Tribunal  issued  further  directions
        seeking details of Mr Hadi's representative or for his  suggestions
        in relation to how he  wishes  to  proceed  with  his  appeal.  The
        directions contain a clear statement that if he did not respond  to
        the directions the Tribunal may assume he is unable or unwilling to
        assist and will arrange to determine the appeal in his absence.


     4.  The  appeal  next  came  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  sitting  at
        Birmingham on 24th June 2013. There was no attendance  by  Mr  Hadi
        nor a representative although Mr Mills was able to confirm that  he
        had been placed on remand at Nottingham Prison following his  being
        charged with the further drug related offences. No order  had  been
        made for his production and it was understood the Crown  Court  was
        due to pass sentence  following  a  guilty  plea.  The  appeal  was
        adjourned  to  be  relisted  on  28th  August  2013  at  Nottingham
        Magistrates Court and directions were given for the  production  of
        all evidence the parties sought to rely upon in  support  of  their
        respective cases.


     5. On 2nd August 2013 the Tribunal received a letter from a Dr  Andrew
        Bowen of the Wathwood  Hospital  RSU  advising  that  Mr  Hadi  was
        currently detained there under Section 48/49 of the  Mental  Health
        Act 1983 following his transfer on  30th  April  2013.  The  letter
        states Mr Hadi had developed a psychotic illness and was  found  to
        be unfit to instruct his legal team and, in Dr Bowen's opinion, was
        unfit to plea. His criminal case had been put back to  7th  October
        2013 in the hope he will respond to the antipsychotic medication he
        is receiving.


     6. As a result of the above the appeal was adjourned  on  28th  August
        2013 until 18th November 2013 with  a  further  direction  for  the
        parties to file the evidence they are seeking to rely upon and  for
        Mr Hadi to file written statements if he is unable  to  attend.  It
        was also directed that if he wishes to attend a hearing he must say
        so and file evidence from Dr Bowen that he is  fit  to  attend  and
        engage in such a hearing. It was also stated in the directions that
        the Tribunal shall consider if a further hearing  was  required  or
        whether the matter can be disposed of without a hearing.


     7. There was no response from Mr Hadi. At the further hearing on  18th
        November 2013 Mr Mills provided a letter from the  CPS  dated  18th
        November 2013 in the following terms:


              Rashid HADI was  charged  last  November  with  conspiracy  to
   supply Class            A (Crack Cocaine) in August 2012


              In very brief terms the prosecution allege that  HADI  was  an
   associated of           a man called Eugene  ROBINSON  who  was  involved
   with HADI and                others in supplying Class A controlled drugs
   (Crack Cocaine) from                  England (East and West Midlands) to
   the Scottish City of  Aberdeen                  between  May  and  August
   2012.


              HADI's involvement was limited to  one  conspiracy  to  supply
   Crack               Cocaine.


              On 10th August 2013 Rashid Hadi went into a  Post  Officer  in
   Derby with a            significant quantity of  Crack  Cocaine  (several
   thousand pounds worth)           and posted the  package  to  a  male  in
   Aberdeen (Steve FORBES).  That            package was intercepted by  the
   Police and HADI was arrested shortly          after he had left the  Post
   Office.


              Just prior to the Plea and  Case  management  Hearing  earlier
   this  year  the            Prosecution  were  provided  with   a   report
   indicating that Rashid HADI was           not fit to plead.  As a  result
   he was not arraigned and did not stand  trial            with  the  other
   defendant's   (most   of   whom   pleaded   guilty).    His    was   case
   adjourned on a number of occasions for assessment to be undertaken.


              On 7th October 2013 he appeared at Court and at that time  was
   considered              fit to plead.  He entered a Guilty  Plea  to  the
   charge and was adjourned to           15th November 2013 for sentence.


              On Friday 15th November 2013 HADI was sentenced to a term of 2
   and a          half years imprisonment. Given the period of time  he  has
   spent in custody             he will only have to serve a number of weeks
   before he will be released.


     8. Notwithstanding Mr Hadi being deemed fit to plead there has been no
        response to the Tribunals directions and after deliberation and  in
        light of the content of the directions issued in this  case  it  is
        considered fair and appropriate for the matter to be determined  on
        the basis of the available evidence without the need for a  further
        hearing.




Discussion



     9. It is a preserved finding that Mr Hadi is a Dutch national who  has
        a right of permanent residence in the UK. He was born  on  the  6th
        December 1991 in Somalia.


    10. The original deportation decision was  made  as  a  result  of  his
        offending  behaviour.   He   has   twelve   convictions   and   two
        reprimand/warning excluding the most recent offence, as follows:

    11. The warning/reprimand given on  10/01/05  was  for  an  offence  of
        criminal damage and on 04/04/09 for possession of a controlled drug
        - Class B - cannabis/cannabis resin.


    12. The deportation of EU nationals is covered by Directive  2004/38/EC
        which is implemented by the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
        Regulations 2006. In LG (Italy) v SSHD  [2008]  EWCA  Civ  190  the
        Court  of  Appeal  said  that  the  2006  Regulations  had  to   be
        interpreted so far as possible to have  the  same  meaning  as  the
        equivalent words in the Directive.


    13. By virtue of Regulation 26, an EEA national may only be removed  if
        his removal is justified "on the grounds of public  policy,  public
        security or public health."  Regulations  21(5)  to  21(6)  provide
        guidance on the proper  approach  to  making  decisions  on  public
        policy and public security.  Regulation 21(5) states that, where  a
        relevant decision is taken on grounds of public  policy  or  public
        security it shall, in addition  to  complying  with  the  preceding
        paragraphs of this regulation, be  taken  in  accordance  with  the
        following principles-


           (a)      the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
   proportionality;


          (b)     the decision must be based  exclusively  on  the  personal
   conduct of the               person concerned;


           (c)      the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned  must
   represent a genuine,             present and sufficiently serious  threat
   affecting one of the fundamental              interests of society;


          (d)     matters isolated from the particulars of the case or which
   relate to                considerations  of  general  prevention  do  not
   justify the decision;


          (e)      a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
   themselves justify the           decision.


    14. Regulation 21(6) states that before taking a relevant  decision  on
        the grounds of public policy or public security in  relation  to  a
        person who is resident in the United  Kingdom  the  decision  maker
        must take account of considerations  such  as  the  age,  state  of
        health, family and economic situation of the person,  the  person's
        length of residence in the United Kingdom, the person's social  and
        cultural integration into the United Kingdom and the extent of  the
        person's links with his country of origin.


    15. By virtue of Regulation 21(3) a decision to remove may not be taken
        in respect of a person with a permanent right  of  residence  under
        regulation 15 except on serious grounds of public policy or  public
        security.


    16. The general approach is in two  stages  (i)  does  the  Appellant's
        conduct satisfy the applicable "public policy"  criterion  (whether
        the general one or the more or most stringent one); and (ii) if  it
        does, is the decision to remove a "proportionate" one  in  all  the
        circumstances.


    17. The Respondent's reasons for deportation letter dated 15th December
        2011 considered Mr Hadi's  immigration  history  and  all  relevant
        factors. He claims to have entered the UK in  2003  using  his  own
        passport with the intention of living and working here but there is
        insufficient evidence to establish that Mr Hadi has resided in  the
        United Kingdom for a continuous period of at least ten years  prior
        to the relevant decision which was taken in 2011 and accounting for
        periods of imprisonment.


    18. In relation to his personal conduct and  the  threat  he  poses  to
        society in general , in MG and VC (Ireland) [2006] UKAIT 00053  the
        Tribunal said that "where regulation 21(3) applies to an individual
        (because he is an EEA national with a permanent right of  residence
        but not a minor or along  term  resident)  he  may  be  removed  as
        previously on the grounds that there is a risk  of  his  committing
        further offences, with the proviso  that  the  risk  of  harm  must
        constitute serious grounds of public policy for his removal."


    19. In BF (Portugal) v SSHD  [2009]  EWCA  Civ  923  the  Appellant,  a
        citizen of Portugal, arrived in the UK and had acquired a right  of
        permanent residence.  He  was  convicted  of  battery  against  his
        partner and sentenced to 42 months imprisonment.  He could only  be
        removed on serious grounds of public  policy  or  public  security.
        The  Tribunal  first  had  to  determine  the  claimant's  relevant
        personal  conduct;  secondly  whether  the  conduct  represented  a
        genuine present and sufficiently serious  threat;  thirdly  whether
        that threat affected one of the fundamental interests  of  society;
        and fourthly whether deportation would be disproportionate  in  all
        the circumstances.   The  Tribunal  noted  the  evidence  that  the
        claimant had a high propensity to re-offend against the same victim
        and any new partner, but went on to find that the SSHD  had  failed
        to prove that there  were  serious  grounds  of  public  policy  or
        security which made deportation proportionate.   In  remitting  the
        appeal, the Court of Appeal said the Tribunal should have reached a
        conclusion as to whether the threat, which was clearly  present  at
        the time of the offence, was still present  at  the  hearing.   The
        Tribunal had to decide whether there was a present  serious  threat
        and if so the extent of that threat.


    20. The first question for this Tribunal  is  to  determine  Mr  Hadi's
        personal conduct which is amply demonstrated by his criminal record
        set out above.


    21. The second question is whether such conduct  represents  a  genuine
        and sufficiently serious threat. In this regard the further  recent
        offending demonstrates the fact  Mr  Hadi  does  represent  such  a
        threat as he has in fact offended on more than one  occasion  since
        the decision to deport him was taken  in  2011.  The  OASys  Report
        dated 26th September 2011 assessed Mr Hadi  as  presenting  a  high
        risk of reoffending. The term "high" meaning there are identifiable
        indicators of risk of  serious  harm.  The  potential  event  could
        happen at any time and the impact would be serious.


    22. There are no up-to-date reports and it is noted that the  offending
        has occurred despite Mr Hadi being  warned  in  2009  that  further
        offending could lead to his deportation. As stated, the more recent
        offence involving drugs were committed after his previous  sentence
        was served and he was aware of the intention to deport  him.   This
        illustrates  a  propensity  to  re-offend  that  corroborates   the
        assessment in the OASys report. This is not  a  decision  that  has
        been  made  based  upon  his  previous  convictions   although   in
        Commission v the Netherlands Case C-50/06 the Commission said  that
        under article 3(1) of the Directive 64/221 measures  taken  on  the
        grounds of public policy  or  public  security  were  to  be  based
        exclusively on the conduct of the person concerned.   Article  3(2)
        specified that previous criminal convictions were not in themselves
        to constitute grounds for taking  such  measures.   They  could  be
        taken into Account only in so far as the  circumstances  which  had
        given rise to that conviction were  evidence  of  personal  conduct
        constituting a present threat to the requirement of public policy.


    23. In relation to whether that threat affected one of the  fundamental
        interests of society; there is a pattern  of  escalating  offending
        involving crimes of violence and drugs. In view of the  devastating
        effects of crimes linked to  drug  trafficking,  Council  Framework
        Decision 2004/757/JHA  of  25  October  2004  laying  down  minimum
        provisions  on  the  constituent  elements  of  criminal  acts  and
        penalties in the field of illicit drug trafficking (OJ 2004 L  335,
        p. 8) states in recital 1 that illicit  drug  trafficking  poses  a
        threat to health, safety and the quality of life of citizens of the
        Union, and to the legal economy,  stability  and  security  of  the
        Member States....Since drug addiction represents a serious evil for
        the individual and is fraught with social and  economic  danger  to
        mankind, trafficking in narcotics as part  of  an  organised  group
        could reach a level of intensity that might directly  threaten  the
        calm and physical security of the population as a whole or a  large
        part of it (in terms of an imperative threat to  public  security).
        The ECJ have held that a Member State  may,  in  the  interests  of
        public policy, consider that the use of drugs constitutes a  danger
        for society such as to justify  special  measures  against  foreign
        nationals who contravene its laws on drugs and dealing in narcotics
        as part of an organised group is a fortiori covered by the  concept
        of 'public policy' for the purposes of Article 28(2)  of  Directive
        2004/38.


    24. In relation to fundamental interests of a society:  In GW (EEA  reg
        21: 'fundamental interests') Netherlands  [2009]  UKAIT  00050  the
        Tribunal said that the 'fundamental interests' of a society  within
        the meaning of regulation 21 (a threat to  which  may  justify  the
        exclusion of an EEA national) is a question  to  be  determined  by
        reference to the legal rules governing the society in question, for
        it is unlikely that conduct that is subject to no  prohibition  can
        be regarded as threatening those interests.


    25. I find it proved that there is a plausible high  risk  of  Mr  Hadi
        committing further offences and that  such  risk  through  acts  of
        violence or the effect of drug use constitutes serious  grounds  of
        public policy for his removal


    26. The forth question is whether deportation would be disproportionate
        in  all  the  circumstances.  In  this   regard   it   is   not   a
        proportionality exercise such as that  conducted  when  considering
        Article 8 ECHR as the  public  policy  ground  for  removal  is  an
        exception to the fundamental principle of the free exercise  of  EU
        rights. It is the proportionality of the decision  in  relation  to
        the right of free movement which is relevant.


    27.  There  is  also  the  issue  of  rehabilitation.   In  R  (on  the
        application of Essa) [2012] EWCA Civ 1718 the Dutch  appellant  had
        been sentenced to 5 years for robbery. It was held that a  decision
        to deport a union citizen had a European  dimension  which  widened
        the consideration beyond the  interests  of  the  expelling  Member
        State and the foreign criminal. The decision maker had to  consider
        whether the deportation decision could prejudice the  prospects  of
        rehabilitation from offending in the host country  and  then  weigh
        that risk in the balance when assessing  proportionality.  In  most
        cases it entailed a comparison with the prospects of rehabilitation
        in the receiving country. The European dimension was  part  of  the
        proportionality exercise in respect of an EU deportee.


    28. The First-tier Panel had the benefit of hearing  evidence  from  Mr
        Hadi and his family members.  It accepted Mr Hadi was  living  with
        his family prior to his imprisonment for the offence of robbery and
        wished to return there on release. They also note the  relationship
        he has with a girlfriend who was due to give birth to a child.  The
        effect of such ties to the family in the UK  should  have  been  to
        deter  Mr  Hadi  from  further  offending  and  to  facilitate  his
        rehabilitation, yet this is not the case.  The  index  offence  was
        committed on 23/04/11 and is entry number 10 on the above schedule.
        Since that offence he committed the offences  numbered  11  and  12
        above and the  recent  drug  related  offences  for  which  he  was
        sentenced on 15th November 2013.


    29. The Kingdom of the Netherlands has a probation  service  which  has
        been developed over a number of years and which is comparable  with
        that available in the UK. It has not  been  shown  that  Mr  Hadi's
        circumstances and the respective probation services of the relevant
        Member States make his chances of rehabilitation greater in the  UK
        than in The Netherlands or visa versa. On the material available to
        the Upper Tribunal it as not been shown to be  disproportionate  to
        deport Mr Hadi who,  as  a  fit,  healthy,  not  unintelligent  and
        resourceful young man, has not shown that he will not  be  able  to
        survive and re-adapt to life in the Netherlands. The  Secretary  of
        State has discharged the burden upon her to prove the  decision  is
        proportionate in terms of EU law.


    30. In relation to Article 8 ECHR, even if family life exists, the risk
        posed to the wider society by Mr  Hadi  as  a  result  of  his  re-
        offending and the nature  of  his  criminality  make  the  decision
        proportionate when considering the legitimate aim  relied  upon  by
        the Secretary of State.


    31. The appeal of Mr  Hadi  against  the  decision  to  deport  him  is
        dismissed on all grounds.


    32. I note however the date of the decision is the 15th  December  2011
        which is over two years ago. Regulation 24 (5) states:


              (5)      Where such a deportation order  is  made  against  a
   person but he is                 not removed under the order during  the
   two year period beginning                 on the date on which the order
   is made, the Secretary of State shall                  only take  action
   to remove the person under the order after the  end                   of
   that  period  if,  having  assessed   whether   there   has   been   any
         material change in circumstances since the deportation  order  was
                  made, he considers  that  the  removal  continues  to  be
   justified  on  the                  grounds  of  public  policy,  public
   security or public health.


    33. The Secretary of State is therefore required to undertake a further
        assessment before removal.


Decision

    34. The  First-tier  Tribunal  Panel  materially  erred  in  law.   The
        decision of the Panel has been set aside. I remake the decision  as
        follows. The appeal of Mr Hadi is dismissed.


   Anonymity.


    35. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005. I make no such order (pursuant to rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
