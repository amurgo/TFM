For the Respondent:    Mr M McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. This is an appeal by  the  Secretary  of  State  against  Judge  Robson's
   decision to allow the appeal of Mr Waris  Khan  against  refusal  of  his
   application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

2. Mr Khan had made his application on the ground that he had  now  acquired
   a period of 10 years' lawful residence and that he thus met the threshold
   criteria for indefinite leave to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  under
   paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules.

3. The Secretary of State had refused the application under  paragraph  322B
   of the Immigration Rules on the ground that Mr Khan  had  been  found  to
   have submitted false payslips in support of an  earlier  application  for
   limited leave to remain as a Highly Skilled Migrant.

4. Judge Robson reversed that earlier finding  and,  having  concluded  that
   "all other elements of the Rules" were met, went on to allow  the  appeal
   [paragraphs 51 and 52].

5. The Secretary of State  has  been  given  permission  to  appeal  on  two
   grounds:

   a) the findings in relation to the submission of false documents  in  the
      earlier application was flawed;

   b) Judge Robson does not appear to have appreciated that he was  confined
      to considering the appeal on human rights grounds only, with  specific
      reference to the appellant's right to respect for private  and  family
      life under Article 8 of the 1950 European Convention of  Human  Rights
      and Fundamental Rights and Freedoms

6. I consider the grounds in turn.

7. On the 31st March 2011, the appellant had applied for leave to remain  as
   a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant. This was refused  on  the  28th  January
   2013 because the Secretary of State was satisfied that the appellant  had
   submitted a false document  in  connection  with  that  application.  The
   document in question was a letter purporting to be from one 'J  Banister'
   (original spelling) of HMRC confirming  the  appellant's  earnings  as  a
   Sales and Marketing Consultant with 'Pattison Enterprises'. Judge  Saffer
   upheld the Secretary of State's position on an appeal from that decision.
   Amongst his reasons for doing so was the fact that the  correct  spelling
   of the official's name contained two 'n's rather than one and that  there
   was no record  of  Pattison  Enterprises  having  been  involved  in  any
   "legitimate trading". The essence of the complaint made by the  Secretary
   of State in this appeal is that Judge Robson went behind the  finding  of
   Judge Saffer with regard to the false document. There was however further
   evidence before Judge Robson that was in my view capable of  leading  him
   to reach a different  conclusion  from  that  of  Judge  Saffer.  I  have
   therefore concluded that this complaint is really  nothing  more  than  a
   disagreement with a finding of fact that Judge  Robson  was  entitled  to
   make upon the evidence that was before him, and  it  does  not  therefore
   identify an 'error of law'. I now turn to the second ground of appeal.

8. Judge Robson did not identify the ground(s) of  appeal  available  to  Mr
   Khan and neither did he engage with the only  ground  that  was  in  fact
   available to him, namely, that the decision was unlawful under section  6
   of the Human Rights Act 1998 as being  incompatible  with  his  right  to
   respect for private and family life under Article 8 of the  Human  Rights
   Convention [see section 84 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
   2002]. This is somewhat surprising given  that  the  designated  Tribunal
   reference number ('HU') made it clear that this was  a  human-rights-only
   appeal and that both parties had dealt extensively with  the  appellant's
   private and family life  (see  the  'Reasons  for  Refusal  Letter',  the
   appellant's witness  statements,  and  the  closing  submissions  of  the
   representatives as recorded at paragraphs 31 and  37  of  Judge  Robson's
   decision). None of this, however, was addressed by Judge Robson.  On  the
   contrary, he appears to have focused solely upon the question of  whether
   the Secretary of State's decision was in accordance with the  Immigration
   Rules. However, this ground of appeal is  not  available  in  respect  of
   applications that were made after the  5th  April  2015.  Judge  Robson's
   decision is accordingly infected by legal error that strikes at the  very
   root of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. I therefore set it aside.

9. I consider that it is unnecessary for me to  remit  this  appeal  to  the
   First-tier Tribunal or to hear further evidence in order to determine it.
   The primary facts were not in issue at  the  hearing  in  the  First-tier
   Tribunal and they are fully recorded in Judge Robson's decision. I  shall
   therefore remake the decision on the basis of those recorded facts.

10. Mr Khan's lawful but precarious residence in the United  Kingdom  for  a
   period of 11 ï¿½ years is clearly such as to engage the potential operation
   of article 8 upon removal. The Secretary of State's decision was made  in
   accordance with the law; that is to say, the legal framework provided  by
   the Immigration Rules. Moreover, the decision is necessary with a view to
   furthering the legitimate aim of maintaining the economic  well-being  of
   the country through the consistent application of  immigration  controls.
   The remaining question is whether the decision is proportionate  to  that
   end. The starting point for consideration of that question  is  paragraph
   276 ADE of the Immigration Rules. This sets out the Secretary of  State's
   view of the operation of Article  8  in  private  life  cases.  The  only
   subparagraph that is engaged by the facts of this  case  is  subparagraph
   (vi) -

    the applicant... is aged 18 years or above, has lived  continuously  in
    the UK for less than 20 years... but there  will  be  very  significant
    obstacles to the applicant's integration into the country to  which  he
    would have to go if required to leave the UK.

11. I am satisfied that Mr Khan would not face any significant obstacles  to
   his reintegration in Pakistan given that this is not only his country  of
   origin, in which he has spent by far the greater part of his life, but it
   is also the country in which his wife, infant daughter,  three  siblings,
   and his wife's parents continue to reside  (see  paragraph  25  of  Judge
   Robson's decision). Moreover, the appellant's stated purpose in coming to
   the United Kingdom for study was in order to increase  his  prospects  of
   obtaining better employment upon return to Pakistan (see paragraph 26  of
   Judge Robson's decision). There is no reason to suppose that this purpose
   would not be realised. Given all of this, it is  difficult  to  see  what
   "compelling  circumstances"   there   might   be   that   would   warrant
   consideration of the appellant's case outside immigration rules  (see  SS
   (Congo) [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387).  The  only  aspect  of  the  appellant's
   circumstances to which no direct reference is made within  paragraph  276
   ADE is period of time that he has resided in the United  Kingdom  falling
   short of 20 years. However, section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration,
   and Asylum Act 2002 in any event enjoins me to attach "little weight"  to
   this circumstance given that it was established at a time when Mr  Khan's
   immigration status in the UK was "precarious". I therefore hold that  the
   appellant's  removal  in  consequence  of  the  decision  to  refuse  his
   application for leave to remain would not be unlawful under section 6  of
   the Human Rights act 1998.

Notice of Decision

12. The appeal of the Secretary of State is allowed.

13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  to  allow  the  appeal  against
   refusal of leave to remain is set aside and is substituted by a  decision
   to dismiss it.

Anonymity is not directed
