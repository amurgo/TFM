For the Appellant:     Mr M Azmi of Counsel, Kausers Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan born on 5 November  1996.   She
    first entered the United Kingdom on 25 December 2012 as  the  dependant
    of her mother, at which time she was 16 years of age.  She subsequently
    made an in time application for leave to remain  as  the  spouse  of  a
    British citizen on  21  December  2017,  having  undergone  an  Islamic
    marriage in February 2017.

 2. This application was refused in a decision dated 13 April 2018, on  the
    single basis that  the  Appellant  did  not  meet  the  minimum  income
    threshold of the financial requirement of Appendix FM.   The  Appellant
    appealed against that decision and her appeal came before Judge  Watson
    on 20 November 2018.

 3. In a decision and reasons promulgated on 29 November  2018,  the  judge
    dismissed the appeal, finding that at the date of decision the specific
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE were not met in respect of the  evidence
    of  the  Sponsor's  employment;  that  there  were  no   insurmountable
    obstacles to the Sponsor and Appellant relocating to Pakistan and  that
    a fresh application could be made by the Appellant via entry  clearance
    in order to return.

 4. Permission to appeal was sought out of time on a number of  bases.  The
    two material grounds of challenge before me were:

      1) Firstly, whether the judge erred in failing to apply  the  relevant
         jurisprudence  cf.  Chikwamba  [2008]  UKHL  40  and  R   (on   the
         application of Chen) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 IAC when  assessing  the
         proportionality of the decision pursuant to Article 8; and

      2) secondly, whether the judge materially erred  in  failing  to  have
         regard to section 117B of the NIAA 2002.

5.   In a decision dated 20 March 2019, First  tier  Tribunal  Judge  Swaney
    granted permission to appeal in inter alia the following terms:

         "6.  In assessing proportionality  outside  the  Rules,  the  judge
         considered whether or not there were  insurmountable  obstacles  to
         family life continuing outside the United Kingdom  and  found  that
         there were not. This conclusion was reasonably open to the judge on
         the evidence before him.

         7.   The judge gave reasons for not attaching weight  to  the  fact
         the appellant satisfied the Rules as at the  date  of  hearing.  In
         doing so the judge gave  significant  weight  to  fair  immigration
         control but failed to have regard to section 117B of the NIAA 2002.
         Section  117B   is   a   mandatory   consideration   in   assessing
         proportionality outside the Rules. On that  basis  it  is  arguable
         that the judge's assessment of proportionality was flawed.

         8.   The grounds of appeal disclose an arguable error of law."

6.   Whilst Judge Swaney gave express permission  only  in  respect  of  the
    failure to consider the statutory public  interest  considerations,  it
    seemed to me that the arguments set out in the first ground  of  appeal
    were arguable and I informed the parties at the outset of  the  hearing
    that I wished to hear them in respect of that argument as well.




    Hearing

7.   On behalf of the Appellant,  Mr  Azmi  submitted  that  the  judge  had
    failed to take account of a material consideration viz section  117B(2)
    and that the Appellant does speak  English.  At  [21]  the  judge  made
    reference to the Appellant requiring an interpreter.  There was in  the
    bundle a certificate from Trinity College,  in  respect  of  which  the
    Appellant obtained an ESOL certificate in English speaking and learning
    at level A1 and he submitted this was sufficient for  the  purposes  of
    section 117B(2) of the NIAA 2002.

8.    In  respect  of  whether  or  not  the   Appellant   was   financially
    independent, it is clear that that requirement was met by  the  finding
    at [20] by Judge Watson that the payslips provided showed  the  Sponsor
    meets the required threshold for the last six  months.  In  respect  of
    section 117B(4), whilst the Appellant's leave has been  precarious,  it
    is material that she has been lawful within the UK throughout her  stay
    since 2012 at the age of 16.  However, in  respect  of  the  precarious
    element of section 117B(5) it is clear from the  judgment  in  Rhuppiah
    [2018] UKSC 58 at [49] that there is a limited  degree  of  flexibility
    when considering this aspect and the Appellant's  positive  immigration
    history is material in this respect, having arrived here as a child.

9.   In respect of the second point, Mr Azmi sought to rely on the  judgment
    of their lordships in Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11 at [51]. He submitted  the
    Court was considering a situation where, even if an individual did  not
    have any form of leave but was  here  lawfully,  there  was  no  public
    interest in the removal of that person following the judgment of  their
    lordships in Chikwamba [2008] UKHL  40.  He  submitted  that  this  was
    clearly applicable.

10.   In relation to the evidence of employment, Mr Azmi took me to page  34
    of the Appellant's bundle which was a letter for Ingeus dated 2 January
    2018 stating that the Sponsor's employment had started  on  6  November
    2017 and that he had earned �17,000 excluding overtime.  In relation to
    the wage slips these were at pages 35 to  45  and  covered  the  period
    November 2017 to October 2018, which was a single wage  slip  contained
    at page 5 of the supplementary bundle.

11.  Mr Azmi submitted that, having been given the opportunity to  calculate
    the amount, the Appellant's overall income  between  November  2017  to
    October 2018  was  �18,811.87.   He  therefore  submitted  the  judge's
    finding at [20] that the Appellant meets the Rules is correct.

12.  In his submissions, Mr Whitwell stated that  whilst  he  accepted  that
    there is no express reference to section 117B of the NIAA 2002, this is
    not  fatal  to  the  appeal  because  the  statutory  public   interest
    considerations were applied in substance  by  the  judge.  Mr  Whitwell
    sought to rely on the fact that at [20] the judge had stated:

         "The appellant states she now meets  the  Rules  and  it  would  be
         disproportionate to make her apply again.  I accept that looking at
         the wage slips provided from November 2017 to the date  of  hearing
         that the Sponsor has earned the required threshold over  6  months.
         This is also demonstrated by entries in the bank statements."

13.  Mr Whitwell submitted that  the  judge  clearly  implicitly  found  the
    Appellant met the financial  requirement  of  Section  117B.   He  also
    sought to rely on the judge's finding at [22]:

         "On the appellant's side of the scales is her claim that she  would
         now meet the Rules if she made a fresh application. Is this  enough
         to  make  it  disproportionate  to  refuse  her  clearly  deficient
         application made in December 2017?  I find it is not.  There  is  a
         strong public interest in firm but fair immigration control and the
         Rules apply to all those who wish to enter or remain in the UK.  It
         would not be in the public interest  to  allow  those  who  make  a
         deficient application, which in this case was based on her need  to
         make  some  sort  of  application  before  her  leave  expired   on
         24.12.2017 to jump the queue of all those who wish to remain.   The
         integrity of the Rules is important.  They can only  be  disapplied
         if strong reasons are shown  and  I  have  been  shown  none.   The
         decision is proportionate."

14.  Mr Whitwell submitted that the judge was clearly here referring to  the
    public interest and thus implicitly addressing section  117B(1),  which
    had been applied in substance if  not  expressly.  In  respect  of  the
    requirement that the Appellant speak  English,  Mr  Whitwell  submitted
    that this is at best a neutral point following the judgment in Rhuppiah
    [2018] UKSC 58.  In  relation  to  the  Chikwamba  point,  Mr  Whitwell
    submitted that R  (ota  Chen)  at  [39]  now  represented  the  correct
    position, where it provides that the Rules need to  be  met  and  there
    then needs to be a disproportionate interference with family  life  due
    to the temporary separation.  Mr Whitwell submitted  this  was  because
    Chen was considered against the backdrop of the material change in  the
    amendments to the Rules in 2014  and  that  the  Secretary  of  State's
    policy had also  changed,  which  was  now  that  there  needed  to  be
    insurmountable obstacles rather than a  focus  on  queue  jumping.   He
    submitted that it is clear from [13] of the judge's decision  and  [21]
    that  the  Appellant  was  asked  whether  there  were   insurmountable
    obstacles and did not provide any, nor any reason as to why  she  would
    be unable to make a new application from Pakistan.

15.  In relation to the financial requirement, Mr Whitwell submitted it  was
    clear from Appendix FM-SE paragraph 2, A1, that the requirement is  six
    months' worth of evidence and payslips prior to making the  application
    and if there is a changed employer this needed  to  be  twelve  months.
    Thus, it was clear that  that  requirement  was  not  met  because  the
    payslips now available were from November 2017 when the Sponsor started
    work at Ignius, which he had  only  done  so  seven  weeks  before  the
    application. Thus he needed to have shown  payslips  for  the  previous
    twelve months at the date of application due to the change in employer.



16.  Mr Whitwell submitted that the Appellant's evidence  that  the  Sponsor
    relied on evidence of a second form of employment, which was  "off  the
    books", this employment was not accepted by the judge and  this  was  a
    finding open to her on the evidence.

17.   In  response,  Mr  Azmi  submitted  that  it  was  notable  from   the
    jurisprudence that the Appellants in those cases did not have leave  or
    were overstayers, whereas this  Appellant's  case  was  distinguishable
    because she had been lawfully resident  in  the  United  Kingdom  since
    2012.

18.  I reserved my decision, which I now give with my reasons.




    Findings and reasons

19.  It is apparent and was not disputed  by  Mr  Whitwell  that  the  Judge
    failed to have regard to the statutory public interest  considerations,
    set out at section 117B of the NIAA 2002. His  argument  was,  however,
    that this was not material given that although no express reference was
    made  to  section  117B,  the  Judge  considered  the  public  interest
    considerations in substance as part of his  overall  findings  e.g.  at
    [20] and [22].

20.  The difficulty with this argument is that it is simply not possible  to
    tell  that  the  Judge  did  have  all  the  material  public  interest
    considerations set out within section 117B in his mind  when  assessing
    the proportionality of removal of the Appellant. I find that it is  far
    from clear at [20] that the Judge took into account in the  Appellant's
    favour that she met the requirements of section 117B(3), given that the
    Judge found simply that he accepted looking  at  the  wage  slips  from
    November 2017 to the date of hearing that the Sponsor has  earned  over
    the required threshold over  6  months  as  was  also  demonstrated  by
    entries in the bank statements. I  find  he  was  here  clearly  having
    regard to the requirements of the Immigration  Rules  rather  than  the
    statutory public interest considerations.

21.  Similarly, in respect of the  findings  at  [22],  the  Judge  held  as
    follows:

         "On the appellant's side of the scales is her claim that she  would
         now meet the Rules if she made a fresh application. Is this  enough
         to  make  it  disproportionate  to  refuse  her  clearly  deficient
         application made in December 2017? I find it is  not.  There  is  a
         strong public interest in firm but fair immigration control and the
         Rules apply to all those who make a deficient application, which in
         this case was based on her need to make some  sort  of  application
         before her leave expired on 24.4.17, to jump the queue  of  all  of
         those who wish to remain. The integrity of the Rules  is  important
         and they can only be disapplied if strong reasons are shown  and  I
         have been shown none. The decision is proportionate."

22.  I find that it is far from apparent that the Judge  here  had  in  mind
    anything  other  than  the  general  public  interest  in   maintaining
    immigration control. There is no reference in the decision and  reasons
    either to whether the Appellant can speak  English  [s117B(2)]  or  the
    basis upon which she developed her private life in the  United  Kingdom
    [s117B(5)]. I find this last factor is particularly material, given the
    undisputed evidence that the Appellant has resided lawfully  since  her
    arrival in the United Kingdom at the age of 16 and that  her  admission
    was as a dependent on her mother in a category that led to  settlement.
    This is clearly a material factor in considering  the  public  interest
    and I find it could have made a material difference to the  outcome  of
    the appeal.

23.  I further find that the Judge erred materially in  law  in  failing  to
    consider  the  Chikwamba  line  of  jurisprudence,  in  light  of   his
    acceptance at [20] that  the  Sponsor  had  earned  over  the  required
    threshold over 6 months and his finding  at  [22]  that  the  Appellant
    would meet the requirements of the Rules if she were to  make  a  fresh
    application. I find that this could have made a material difference  to
    the outcome of the appeal.

24.  I set the decision of First Tier Tribunal Judge Watson  aside  and  re-
    make the decision.

25.   In  respect  of   the   section   117B   statutory   public   interest
    considerations, I find,  in  light  of  the  fact  that  the  Appellant
    produced at AB 16 a Grade 2 certificate in  spoken  English,  level  A1
    with distinction dated 7 December 2017, that  she  speaks  English  and
    thus the requirements of section 117B (2) of the NIAA 2002 are met.  In
    light of the Judge's finding, which is  supported  by  the  documentary
    evidence at AB 35-84 that the Sponsor earns sufficient  funds  to  meet
    the financial requirement of E-LTRP  3.1.(a)  of  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules, I find that the requirements of section  117B(3)  is
    met. In respect of section 117B(5), I  find  that  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant entered the United  Kingdom  as  a  child  dependent  of  her
    mother, in a category which leads to settlement, is  material,  bearing
    in mind the judgment of their Lordships in Rhuppiah [2018] UKSC  58  at
    [49]:

         "But, as both parties agree, the effect of  section  117A(2)(a)  is
         clear. It recognises that the provisions of section 117B cannot put
         decision-makers  in  a  strait-jacket  which  constrains  them   to
         determine claims under article 8 inconsistently  with  the  article
         itself. Inbuilt into the concept of "little  weight"  itself  is  a
         small degree of  flexibility;  but  it  is  in  particular  section
         117A(2)(a)  which  provides  the  limited  degree  of   flexibility
         recognised to be necessary in para 36 above.  Although  this  court
         today defines a precarious immigration status for  the  purpose  of
         section 117B(5) with a width from which most applicants who rely on
         their private life under  article  8  will  be  unable  to  escape,
         section   117A(2)(a)   necessarily   enables   their   applications
         occasionally to succeed."

26.  The House of Lords judgment in Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40 per Lord  Brown
    at [44] established that:

         "... only comparatively rarely, certainly in family cases involving
         children, should an article 8 appeal be dismissed on the basis that
         it would be proportionate and more appropriate for the appellant to
         apply for leave from abroad."

27.  Mr Whitwell argued  that  since  the  advent  of  the  changes  to  the
    Immigration Rules and the coming into force of  Appendix  FM  that  the
    position had changed and that the judgment in R (ota Chen)  IJR  [2015]
    UKUT 00189 IAC now represents the correct position in law:

         "39. In my judgement, if it is shown by an individual  (the  burden
         being upon him or her) that an application for entry clearance from
         abroad would  be  granted  and  that  there  would  be  significant
         interference with family life by temporary removal, the  weight  to
         be accorded to the formal requirement of obtaining entry  clearance
         is reduced."

28.  However, the  Applicant  in  Chen  was  in  the  United  Kingdom  on  a
    temporary basis as a student; her leave expired well before she and her
    husband began  their  relationship;  they  were  married  in  the  full
    knowledge that the  applicant  did  not     have  leave  and  that  her
    immigration status was precarious [43]. I accept Mr  Azmi's  submission
    this Appellant's  case  is  distinguishable  from  Chen  in  that  this
    Appellant has at  all  times  been  residing  lawfully  in  the  United
    Kingdom, having been admitted as the dependent of her mother,  who  was
    present and settled and then obtained an extension of leave in the same
    category. Whilst at the time the Appellant made an in time  application
    for further leave on the basis of her marriage, her husband and Sponsor
    had not been working for sufficiently long with the  same  employer  to
    meet the requirements of Appendix FM SE, I find it was reasonable  that
    they sought to make an in time application rather than wait, given that
    this would have meant that the Appellant became an overstayer.

29.  I find, for the reasons set out above, that the  public  interest  does
    not require the Appellant to leave  the  United  Kingdom  in  order  to
    return to Pakistan simply for the purpose of obtaining entry  clearance
    to re-join her husband in the United Kingdom and that to require her to
    do so would be disproportionate.




    Decision

30.  The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds.
