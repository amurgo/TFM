                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision of Judge Upson made
    following a hearing at Bradford on 24th May 2013.



Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of India  born  on  11th  March  1947.   She
    applied to come to the UK to join her husband Mr Gurdip Singh  who  had
    gone to the UK in 1991 and he obtained indefinite leave  to  remain  in
    2010.  No application was made for  her  to  join  him  at  that  stage
    because it was known that she would not be able  to  meet  the  English
    language requirements.  The Appellant became 65 in March 2012 at  which
    point she became exempt.

 3. The central issue in this appeal is when she made  her  application  to
    join the Sponsor.   The  facts  are  not  in  dispute.   The  Appellant
    submitted an online application on 6th July 2012 three days before  the
    changes in the Immigration Rules.   She  was  then  given  a  reference
    number which was valid for 28 days and told that within that period she
    could book an appointment and pay the fee.  The fee was paid two  weeks
    later on 19th or 20th July.

 4. The Appellant was refused under the new Rules on the grounds  that  the
    Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  not  satisfied  that  the   Appellant's
    relationship with the Sponsor was genuine and subsisting nor  that  she
    could meet the maintenance requirements.

 5. The judge found that the Appellant had applied in person  on  19th/20th
    July and agreed with the Entry Clearance Officer that the appeal should
    fail on both counts.

The Grounds of Application

 6. The Appellant appealed on the grounds that  the  judge's  decision  was
    against the weight of evidence and had not applied the proper  standard
    of proof.

 7. Secondly he had failed to take into account that  in  India  applicants
    are not allowed to visit the High Commission or their nominated  agents
    without first submitting an online application.  The Appellant  did  so
    on 6th July 2012 and was not given a date until 19th  July  2012  which
    was unfair because it was not her fault that she was not given  a  date
    until after the rule change.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by Designated Judge  Campbell  on  the
    date  of  application  point.   He  said  that  if  the  administrative
    procedure requires an online application in all cases it  was  arguable
    that the relevant date was the date of the online submission.

 9. On 29th July 2013 the Respondent served a reply defending  the  judge's
    determination but in any  event  arguing  that  the  finding  that  the
    parties do not have a genuine and  subsisting  marriage  had  not  been
    challenged and therefore irrespective of which  Rule  was  applied  the
    appeal could not succeed.

Submissions

10. Mr Janjua accepted that his firm completed  the  application  form  and
    advised the Appellant to put in the application before  the  change  in
    the law and that he was not aware that the relevant date would  be  the
    date on which the fee was paid, but submitted that it was incumbent, as
    a matter of fairness, on the  British  High  Commission  New  Delhi  to
    inform the Appellant that she had only four days to pay the fee or  the
    application would be considered under the new Rules.

11. In the USA or Europe it was possible for an online  application  to  be
    accompanied by a card payment but the  British  High  Commission  India
    could not take payments online.  If they had the facility to do so  the
    payment could have been made at the same time as the online application
    which would have been before the Rule change.  It was  a  principle  of
    English law that all applicants should be treated equally but the  High
    Commission in New Delhi  was  not  in  a  position  to  process  online
    applications in the way that European embassies did.  They should  have
    stopped accepting online applications at the point when they could  not
    be processed before the Rule change. There was no warning that  if  the
    Appellant did not make the payment before 9th July she would be treated
    under the  new  Rules,  and  there  ought  to  have  been  transitional
    provisions.  In  accepting  the  application  on  6th  July  the   High
    Commission had made a contract with the Appellant that the  application
    would be treated under the old Rules.

12. Secondly he submitted that the judge's decision on the  subsistence  of
    the marriage  was  against  the  weight  of  the  evidence.   Both  the
    Appellant and Sponsor were elderly and illiterate  but  they  had  been
    married for over 30 years and had communicated with each  other  during
    the Sponsor's absence by telephone cards and there had  been  a  recent
    visit.  Furthermore the Sponsor had  assisted  his  wife  to  make  the
    application - there would have been no reason for him to pay a  fee  of
    ï¿½1,000 and embark on a lengthy and expensive procedure if the  marriage
    was not subsisting.

13. Mrs Pettersen relied on the case of Kaur (Entry  Clearance  -  date  of
    application) [2013] UKUT 00381 in which the Upper  Tribunal  held  that
    the date on which an application for entry clearance  is  made  is  not
    effectively established by any of the  provisions  of  the  Immigration
    Rules and has to be established by reference to statute  and  secondary
    legislation.  An application which does not comply with the requirement
    in Regulation 37 of the Immigration and Nationality (Fees)  Regulations
    2011 to be accompanied by payment of a fee is  a  nullity  and  not  an
    application for the purpose of the Immigration Rules or  any  statutory
    provisions.  An application for entry clearance is  therefore  made  on
    the date on which  payment  of  the  relevant  fee  is  made.   If  the
    application is made online and payment of the relevant fee is also made
    online contemporaneously with submission of the online application  the
    date of application is the date  of  submission.   If  payment  of  the
    relevant fee  is  not  made  until  the  printed  application  form  is
    submitted the date of application is the date on which those are handed
    over.

14. Accordingly it was clear that the relevant date in this case  was  when
    the fee was paid i.e. after the Rule change.  It had been open  to  the
    Appellant to make  her  application  earlier,  specifically  after  she
    became 65 in March 2012, or following the  announcement  on  19th  June
    2012 that the Rules would be  changed.  She  was  assisted  by  legally
    qualified  persons  who  would  be  expected  to  be  aware  that   the
    Regulations make it clear that no application is made until the fee  is
    paid and who should  have  ensured  that  the  application  was  either
    accompanied by the fee or made 28 days  before  the  Rule  change.  The
    Appellant had the alternative of making her visa application by courier
    or FedEx and accompanied by the fee payment when  it  would  have  been
    stamped as received on the date given by the courier.

15. With respect to the substantive issue she  said  that  the  judge  made
    findings open to him on the evidence.  The Sponsor was not accepted  to
    be a credible witness and the judge's conclusions were sustainable.

Findings and Conclusions

16. This application was made on 19th July, after the Rules  were  changed,
    when the fees were paid.

17. Regulation 37 of the Immigration  and  Nationality  (Fees)  Regulations
    2011 provides

         "Where an application to which these Regulations  refer  is  to  be
         accompanied by a specified fee, the application is not validly made
         unless it has been accompanied by that fee."

18. The Appellant's professional advisors were therefore  aware  or  should
    have been  aware,  of  the  relevant  date  for  consideration  of  the
    application.

19. Mr Janjua submits that it is discriminatory against  Indian  applicants
    that the British High Commission  India  is  unable  to  accept  online
    payments and therefore European applicants had  an  advantage  in  that
    they would have been able to submit an application on the same date  as
    an Indian applicant but have their application considered under the old
    Rules.

20. This argument would have had more force if it could properly be  argued
    that the Appellant was taken by surprise and that she could have had no
    reasonable expectation that the application would be  considered  under
    the new Rules.  However Janjua & Associates were plainly aware that the
    British High Commission could not receive card payments  and  therefore
    could and should have advised the Appellant to make the application  28
    days before 9th July 2013 or to submit by courier  and  accompanied  by
    the relevant fee.  The Appellant had been in a  position  to  make  the
    application which she did since March 2012 and, had she  done  so  more
    promptly, the application would have  been  considered  under  the  old
    Rules.

21. There is no generalised duty on an entry clearance  officer  to  inform
    each  Appellant  of  an  imminent  change  in  the  Immigration  Rules.
    Immigration advisors are expected to keep themselves  informed  of  the
    relevant Rules and Regulations and to advise their clients accordingly.
    The fact that other embassies were able to take card payments does  not
    make  the  actions  of  the  High  Commission  in  India  unlawful   as
    discriminatory or unfair because every party knew  precisely  what  the
    position was.  Moreover the Appellant  had  two  distinct  alternatives
    available to her namely to make the application earlier or  in  another
    way.

22. Mr Janjua is simply wrong to say that the High Commission entered  into
    a contract with the Appellant to consider the application under the old
    Rules on 6th July 2012 since no consideration i.e. the  fee,  was  paid
    until 19th July 2012.

23. So far as this  Appellant  is  concerned  the  date  is  in  any  event
    immaterial since the requirement that there be a subsisting marriage in
    which both parties intended to live with each other is the  same  under
    the old Rules as the new.  The judge  made  sustainable  findings  that
    there was not.  He found that there was no record of his claimed  visit
    to India in 2010 and discrepant evidence as to whether the Sponsor  and
    Appellant used a mobile phone number or a landline to communicate.

24. The Appellant's  representative's  submissions  were  recorded  in  the
    determination and there is no mention of the  present  submission  that
    the mere fact that the application was made in itself shows  that  this
    is a subsisting marriage.  The judge could not be expected to deal with
    submissions which were not made to him.  In any event it  is  not  made
    out.  If that were the case  no  application  could  ever  be  properly
    refused on subsistence grounds.

Decision

25. The original judge did not err in law and  his  decision  stands.   The
    Appellant's appeal is dismissed.
