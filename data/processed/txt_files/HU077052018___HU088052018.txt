                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against a decision of Judge  Owens  (the
    judge) of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (the  FtT)  promulgated  on  29th
    November 2018.

 2. The Respondents before the Upper Tribunal were  the  Appellants  before
    the FtT and I will refer to them as the claimants. They are citizens of
    Bangladesh.

 3. The first claimant was in the UK with leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (General) Migrant with leave valid until 23rd May 2016.   On  20th  May
    2016 he lodged an application for indefinite leave to remain as a  Tier
    1 (General) Migrant.  On 17th July 2017 this application was varied  to
    an application for indefinite leave to remain in the UK on the  grounds
    of long residence, relying  upon  paragraph  276B  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 4. The second claimant is the first claimant's wife.  She was  in  the  UK
    with leave as the dependant of her husband.  In May  2016  she  applied
    for leave to remain as the dependant of her husband, and in  July  2017
    varied her application to an application for leave to remain in the  UK
    as the spouse of her husband who was applying for indefinite  leave  to
    remain.

 5. Following refusal of the applications the claimants appealed to the FtT
    and their appeals were heard together on 30th October 2018.

 6. The judge noted that the Secretary  of  State  had  refused  the  first
    claimant's application with reference to paragraph 276B(ii)  and  (iii)
    and with the reference to paragraph 322(5) on the basis that  it  would
    be undesirable to permit the first claimant to remain in the UK in  the
    light of his  conduct,  character  or  associations.   The  reason  for
    refusal was that  the  Secretary  of  State  believed  that  the  first
    claimant had acted dishonestly because his claimed income  when  making
    his Tier 1 applications far exceeded the income that he  declared  when
    completing tax returns.

 7. The judge found that the Secretary of State had failed  to  prove  that
    the first claimant had acted dishonestly.  It was not accepted that the
    Secretary of State had proved that the first claimant had inflated  his
    income from self-employment for the purpose of submitting  his  Tier  1
    applications, finding  at  paragraph  55  that  the  assertion  by  the
    Secretary of State was "simply not substantiated."

 8. The judge found that the Secretary of State had failed  to  prove  that
    the first claimant had acted dishonestly in failing to declare  all  of
    his income for income tax purposes.  The judge concluded that the first
    claimant had not dishonestly submitted false tax returns but had  acted
    carelessly in failing to check his tax returns.

 9. The judge found that the second claimant could satisfy the requirements
    of Appendix  FM,  including  the  financial  requirements  and  English
    language requirement.

10.  The  judge  concluded  that  as  the  claimants  could   satisfy   the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules in respect of private  or  family
    life, there would be no public interest in their removal  from  the  UK
    and the appeals were allowed.

11. The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal contending that the judge had made a material misdirection  in
    law, and failed to provide adequate reasons for findings.

12. The  Secretary  of  State  relied  upon  the  guidance  in  R  (on  the
    application of Khan) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC).  Specific  reference  was
    made to paragraphs (iv) and (v) of the headnote to Khan.

13. It was submitted that the judge had failed to  correctly  consider  the
    guidance in Khan as the judge had appeared to find the first claimant's
    explanation as to why his tax bill was so low to  be  implausible,  but
    went on to find that this was in fact explained satisfactorily  because
    it was the first tax return that the first claimant had submitted.

14. It was submitted that the judge had erred by accepting, without  giving
    reasons, that the first claimant did not check or sign his tax returns.
     It was submitted that the judge had materially  erred  in  considering
    whether the first claimant's actions were dishonest,  especially  given
    the large discrepancies in the declared income, and the  fact  that  it
    went unnoticed for so long.

15. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Mark Davies of the  FtT,  who
    after granting permission gave the following reasons for that decision;



         "1.  The Respondent seeks permission to appeal against the decision
             of the First-tier Tribunal Judge promulgated on 29th  November
             2018 who allowed the appellants' appeals against the  decision
             to refuse them indefinite leave to remain.

         2.   It is arguable that the judge failed to take into account  all
             aspects of the guidance given by the  Upper  Tribunal  in  the
             case of Khan.

         3.   The grounds are simply a disagreement with the  findings  made
             by the judge.

         4.   The judge considered all the evidence and made findings on the
             evidence applying the correct burden and standard of proof.

         5.   The grounds and the decision do not disclose an arguable error
             of law."

16. Following the grant of permission the claimants made an application  to
    the FtT pursuant to rule 31 of the Tribunal Procedure Rules 2014  which
    relates  to  clerical  mistakes  and  accidental  slips  or  omissions,
    contending that Judge Davies had clearly meant to refuse permission  to
    appeal but erred by granting permission.

17. An application was  made  to  adjourn  the  hearing  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal so that the FtT could consider the rule 31 application.

18. The application for an adjournment was refused by Upper Tribunal  Judge
    Rintoul in the following terms;

         "The application for an adjournment is refused.  While the grant of
         permission is difficult  to  follow,  rule  31  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal (Procedure) Rules cannot be used to reverse the effect  of
         a decision - see Katsonga (slip rule; FtT's general powers)  [2016]
         UKUT 228 (IAC).

         In the circumstances there is no prospect of the  application  made
         to the First-tier Tribunal succeeding, and I consider that it would
         be better if the appeal were to proceed on 27th February 2019."

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

19. I heard oral submissions from both representatives.  They are  recorded
    in my Record of Proceedings and briefly summarised below.

20. On behalf of the Secretary of State Mrs Kenny relied upon  the  grounds
    upon which permission to appeal had been  granted.   It  was  submitted
    that the judge had not complied with the guidance given  in  Khan.   It
    was contended that the judge had failed to provide adequate reasons for
    accepting the explanation given by the first claimant that he  had  not
    acted dishonestly.

21. Mr Hodgetts relied upon a response submitted pursuant to rule 24 of the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.  In  brief  summary  it
    was submitted that the grounds relied on  by  the  Secretary  of  State
    amounted to a disagreement and did not disclose  a  material  error  of
    law.

22. It was submitted that the judge had made findings which  were  open  to
    make on the evidence and given adequate  and  sustainable  reasons  for
    those findings.  The judge had considered  all  the  evidence  and  the
    decision did not disclose any irrationality or perversity.

My Conclusions and Reasons

23. I find it appropriate, as the Secretary of State's  challenge  contends
    that the judge gave insufficient reasons for findings, to set  out  the
    guidance given in Budhathoki (reasons for decisions) [2014] UKUT  00341
    (IAC);

         "It is generally unnecessary and unhelpful for First-tier  Tribunal
         judgments to rehearse every detail or issue raised in a case.  This
         leads to judgments becoming overly long and confused and is  not  a
         proportionate  approach  to  deciding  cases.   It   is,   however,
         necessary for judges to identify and resolve key conflicts  in  the
         evidence and explain in clear and brief  terms  their  reasons,  so
         that the parties can understand why they have won or lost."

24. In my view the judge followed the guidance in Khan, and  that  guidance
    is summarised at paragraphs 21-26.  I do not find that the judge made a
    material misdirection of law, nor do I find  that  the  judge  provided
    inadequate reasons for findings made.  I reach  these  conclusions  for
    the following reasons.

25. The judge correctly set  out  the  burden  and  standard  of  proof  at
    paragraphs 19-20.  At paragraph 21 the judge correctly recognised  that
    each appeal will be fact sensitive.

26. At paragraph 45 the judge found there  was  a  significant  discrepancy
    when the first claimant's Tier 1 application and tax return for the tax
    year ending April 2011 were compared.  There was undisclosed income  of
    approximately �40,000.

27. At paragraph 49 the judge found that when a further Tier 1  application
    was compared with a tax return for the year ending  April  2013,  there
    was undeclared income of approximately �11,999.

28. It is apparent the judge was well aware of  substantial  discrepancies.
    The judge at paragraph 54 summarised the issue in the  appeal,  on  the
    basis that findings needed to be made as to whether the first claimant,
    was deliberately dishonest or careless or negligent.

29. At paragraph 55 the judge dealt with the issue as to whether the  first
    claimant had inflated his earnings for the purpose  of  making  Tier  1
    applications.  The judge noted that when those applications were  made,
    the Secretary of State accepted that the  first  claimant  supplied  "a
    full paper trail of his  self-employed  income."   The  first  claimant
    adduced different evidence in respect to the various sources of  income
    which included bank statements and invoices.  The  Secretary  of  State
    had not provided any evidence to show that the bank statements or other
    documents were fraudulent or manufactured, and the judge  was  entitled
    to find "that this assertion is simply not substantiated."

30. The judge, at paragraph 56, found that the real  issue  in  the  appeal
    related to whether the first claimant  had  deliberately  underreported
    his self-employed income in order to dishonestly benefit by paying less
    tax.

31. The judge considered the  first  claimant's  explanation  and  provided
    reasons for accepting that  explanation  at  paragraphs  57-67  of  the
    decision.

32. The judge found that the first claimant had not previously submitted  a
    tax return in the UK until the return submitted  in  2012.   The  first
    claimant had provided evidence from his  accountants,  that  they  were
    responsible for the error in the  tax  returns.   The  accountants  had
    submitted a letter accepting responsibility.

33. Once aware of the discrepancy the first claimant rectified the  mistake
    prior to submitting his application for indefinite leave to remain  and
    entered into an arrangement to pay the outstanding tax.

34. The judge was entitled to find that the first claimant  is  not  a  tax
    expert and relied upon his accountant, who is a certified and chartered
    accountant.  The judge was entitled to find that the first claimant had
    provided consistent evidence, and provided evidence from his accountant
    who took responsibility for the errors.

35. The judge at paragraph 61 took into account the significant discrepancy
    and that  this  was  not  picked  up  for  several  years.   The  judge
    considered whether it was plausible that the first claimant  would  not
    realise that the amount of tax he was paying on  a  substantial  income
    was very low.  The judge  found  that  the  first  claimant  had  never
    previously submitted a tax return  in  the  UK.   The  judge  noted  at
    paragraph 62 that the accountant had in fact submitted three  different
    versions of the same tax return on the same day which was 15th  January
    2014, which indicates that the accountant was fallible.

36. It is appropriate to note that the judge heard oral evidence  from  the
    first claimant, who was cross-examined and the  judge  found  that  the
    evidence given by the first  claimant  was  not  undermined  in  cross-
    examination.

37. In my view the judge was entitled to conclude  that  the  Secretary  of
    State had not proved that  the  first  claimant  dishonestly  submitted
    false tax returns, and was entitled to conclude that the error was made
    by the accountant, which was accepted by the accountant, and the  first
    claimant acted carelessly in failing to check his tax  returns  and  to
    make sure he paid the correct tax.

38. I conclude that  the  judge  considered  all  relevant  evidence,  made
    findings open to  make  on  the  evidence,  and  gave  sustainable  and
    adequate reasons for those findings.  The duty to  provide  reasons  as
    set out in Budhathoki, has been complied with.

39.  I  find  the  challenge  by  the  Secretary  of  State  amounts  to  a
    disagreement with findings made by the judge, but does not  disclose  a
    material error of law.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the FtT does not disclose a material error  of  law.   I  do
not set aside the decision.   The  appeal  of  the  Secretary  of  State  is
dismissed.

There has been no request for anonymity and no anonymity direction is made.
