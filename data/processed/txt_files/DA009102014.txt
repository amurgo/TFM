Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Jaisri, instructed by ADH Law Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Cyprus born in 1983. He  appeals  against
    the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge J Bartlett, dated 27th  April
    2017,  dismissing  his  appeal  against  deportation  on  human  rights
    grounds.

2.   The Appellant appealed on four grounds.  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Hill QC  refused  permission  on  three  of  the  grounds.  He  granted
    permission on the following basis:


         "It is arguable that the judge made an error of law in paragraph 48
         in  having  regard  to  a   juvenile   conviction   for   wounding,
         notwithstanding the approach apparently advocated in Rexha  (S.117C
         - earlier  offences)  [2016]  UKUT  00335.  If,  as  the  applicant
         submits, the respondent did not rely upon it when making the order,
         it may not have been open to the judge to do so."

Submissions


3.    Mr  Jaisri  submitted  that  the  judge  considered  the   Appellant's
    conviction  for  grievous  bodily  harm  in  January  1999   [the   GBH
    conviction] at paragraph 48 when considering whether it would be unduly
    harsh for the Appellant to  be  deported.  Following  paragraph  14  of
    Rexha, the judge was not able to take the GBH conviction  into  account
    because it was not relied on as part of  the  Respondent's  deportation
    decision. At paragraph 34, the judge agreed with the submission by  the
    Presenting Officer and found that the GBH conviction  was  relevant  to
    the consideration of section 117C of the  Nationality  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002. However, the  Respondent  did  not  rely  on  the  GBH
    conviction, for  which  the  Appellant  was  sentenced  to  a  term  of
    imprisonment of more than four years,  as  the  index  offence  in  the
    decision letter. Therefore, the judge was not able to rely on  it  when
    assessing proportionality and the relevant factors in section 117C.

4.   The consequences of the judge's findings were apparent  from  paragraph
    52 of the decision where the judge  stated  "Taking  all  factors  into
    account, I do not find that it is  unduly  harsh  for  the  Appellant's
    children to remain in the UK without the Appellant." It was clear  that
    the judge had taken into account the GBH conviction  and  she  was  not
    entitled  to  do  so.  Had  she  disregarded  this  conviction  in  her
    assessment under section 117C, she  could  have  come  to  a  different
    decision.

5.   Mr Melvin relied  on  the  Rule  24  response  and  accepted  that  the
    Respondent was not relying on the sentence of imprisonment in excess of
    four years under the Immigration Rules. However, the judge was entitled
    to consider the GBH conviction under section 117C. Mr Melvin  submitted
    that just because the Respondent was not relying on the GBH  conviction
    in coming to her decision to deport the Appellant, it did not mean that
    the judge could not consider the whole  of  the  Appellant's  offending
    behaviour when looking at  whether  his  deportation  would  be  unduly
    harsh.

6.   Mr Melvin submitted that it was clear from the panel's finding  in  the
    case of Johnson (deportation - 4 years imprisonment)  [2016]  UKUT  282
    (IAC), that the judge was not prevented from  looking  at  the  overall
    immigration history when considering section 117C. The judge had  taken
    into account the warning letter sent to the Appellant in this case  and
    the judge's findings at paragraphs 48 and 59 were open to the judge  on
    the evidence before her.

7.   Mr Melvin submitted that paragraphs 31 and 32 of  Johnson  demonstrated
    that the judge was entitled to take into account the factors  she  did.
    The Appellant's GBH conviction in 1999 could not be ignored even though
    it was not directly relied upon by the Secretary of State  because  the
    judge could not ignore something that factually happened. It was  clear
    in the refusal letter, when the  Respondent  set  out  the  Appellant's
    immigration history, that the GBH conviction was taken into account and
    therefore there was no material error of law in the judge's decision.

8.   In response, Mr Jaisri submitted that the Respondent had not relied  on
    the GBH conviction and therefore the judge could  not  rely  on  it  in
    assessing section 117C.


The Appellant's Immigration History

9.   The Appellant was born in northern Cyprus and  arrived  in  the  UK  on
    18th May 1991 when he was 7 years of age.  He was  accompanied  by  his
    mother  and  brother.  His  father  subsequently   lodged   an   asylum
    application with the Appellant as his dependant.  On 21st August  2000,
    the Appellant was granted indefinite leave to enter the United  Kingdom
    in line with his father, who had been granted refugee status.


The Appellant's Criminal Convictions

10.  On 4th January 1999, the  Appellant  was  convicted  of  wounding  with
    intent to do grievous bodily harm and sentenced to five years  and  six
    months' imprisonment.  On 31st  January  2010,  he  was  convicted  for
    driving a motor vehicle with excess alcohol and fined �200, ordered  to
    pay �50 costs, disqualified from driving for sixteen  months,  and  had
    his driving licence endorsed. On 27th October 2010, he was convicted of
    possessing class B controlled drugs (cannabis) with  intent  to  supply
    and facilitating the acquisition of criminal property and sentenced  to
    six months' imprisonment. On  1st  February  2011,  the  Appellant  was
    convicted of possessing class B controlled drugs (cannabis) with intent
    to supply and acquiring criminal property. He was sentenced to one year
    and nine months' imprisonment.

The Respondent's Decision

11.  The Respondent's decision is summarised as follows.  In  light  of  the
    Appellant's conviction of one year and nine months, it  was  considered
    that paragraph 398(b) applied. The Respondent then considered paragraph
    399A as the Appellant claimed to have a parental relationship with  two
    British children, R and I. The  Respondent  did  not  accept  that  the
    Appellant had a genuine and subsisting relationship with  his  children
    and records showed that he lived with his parents in Hackney,  but  his
    children lived with their mother in Enfield.

12.  The Respondent did not accept that it would be unreasonable for R or  I
    to reside in northern Cyprus with the Appellant. They were young enough
    to adapt with the help of the Appellant and their mother. Their  mother
    was born in Northern Cyprus and she was familiar with Turkish  culture.
    In addition, English was widely spoken there. The children's mother was
    able to care for them in the UK and contact could be maintained through
    modern means of communication or visits. It was not accepted  that  the
    Appellant's right to family  life  with  his  children  outweighed  the
    public interest in the Appellant being deported.

13.  It was not accepted that the Appellant was in a genuine and  subsisting
    relationship with AT, his wife. It was accepted that she was a  British
    citizen and that she had lived in the UK with valid leave for at  least
    fifteen  years  preceding  the  immigration  decision.   However,   the
    Respondent did not accept that there were insurmountable  obstacles  to
    family life continuing outside the UK. There was no evidence  that  the
    Appellant had been living with AT. She was able to join  the  Appellant
    abroad or maintain contact through visits.

14.  The Appellant could not  satisfy  paragraph  399A  of  the  Immigration
    Rules. Once his criminal convictions had been discounted his  residence
    in the UK immediately preceding  the  decision  was  less  than  twenty
    years. The Appellant spent his formative years in Northern  Cyprus,  he
    spoke Turkish and would be able  to  build  an  adequate  private  life
    there. The Appellant had extended family members in Northern Cyprus and
    they had friends or other contacts.

15.  The Appellant's brother was deported from the United Kingdom to  Cyprus
    on 16th  March  2009  following  his  conviction  for  five  counts  of
    possession  with  intent  to  supply  drugs.  The  Appellant  also  had
    grandparents in Northern Cyprus.  The  Appellant's  other  brother  was
    served with a deportation order in  2011  following  a  conviction  for
    possessing a class A controlled drug (cocaine) with intent  to  supply.
    He was appeal rights exhausted and removal had not yet been enforced.

The Judge's Conclusions

16.  The judge's findings relevant to the issue on appeal are as follows:

         "29.  Section  32  of  the  Borders  Act  2007  provides  that  the
             Appellant's deportation is conducive to the public  good  save
             for the applicability of one of the exceptions in Section 33."


         "31. The Appellant's deportation is conducive to  the  public  good
             and in the public interest in accordance with paragraph 398(b)
             because he was convicted of an offence in 2011  for  which  he
             was sentenced to a period of one year and nine months which is
             less than four  years  but  greater  than  twelve  months.  In
             accordance with  paragraph  398(b)  I  must  consider  whether
             paragraph 399 or 399A applies."


17.  The judge then considered MM (Uganda) [2016] EWCA Civ 450 and  properly
    directed herself on the meaning of unduly harsh.  At paragraph  33  she
    stated:

         "33. I have given consideration to Section 117C and Rexha (S.117C -
             earlier offences) [2016] UKUT 00335 (IAC) which states:


                  'In our judgment the expression 'has  been  convicted'  in
                  the context of Section 117C(6) and (7) does not limit  the
                  application of  that  Section  to  solely  the  conviction
                  immediately  prior  to  and  prompting  the  making  of  a
                  decision to deport.'"


18.  At paragraph 34 the judge agreed with the submissions made by the  Home
    Office representative, stating that:

         "34. In carrying out the assessment under Section 117C I must  have
             regard to all of the Appellant's offending  history  including
             his previous sentence to a term of imprisonment in  excess  of
             four years. However for  completeness  I  state  that  I  have
             considered whether Exception 1  and  Exception  2  of  Section
             117C(4)  applies  in  the  Appellant's  case  as  part  of  my
             assessment under the Immigration Rules which as I have set out
             above is the same in Section 117C.


19.  The judge considered the best interests of the children and noted  that
    "the Appellant's convictions for possessing and dealing drugs  in  2010
    and 2011 were at a time when he had two reasonably young  children.  In
    relation to the second conviction the Appellant was arrested with drugs
    paraphernalia  at  the  family  home  where  his  children  live.   The
    Appellant's evidence was that he did not store  it  at  his  children's
    home and that his customers did not come to the family  home.  However,
    on the Appellant's own evidence he was smoking cannabis up to ten times
    a day, he had a drugs paraphernalia and drugs in the  family  home.  In
    addition, I find that he carried out  activities  relating  to  dealing
    drugs at the family home because he had drugs, scales and bags for  the
    drugs at the family home. It is obvious that drug dealing at the family
    home is not in the best interests of the  children.  I  find  that  the
    Appellant had a complete disregard for the welfare of his children  and
    instead prioritised his own drug habit  and  drug  dealing.  I  do  not
    accept the Appellant's evidence that  he  only  started  dealing  drugs
    shortly before he was arrested. By January 2011, the date of his second
    drugs conviction, the Appellant's second  child  was  approximately  14
    months old and he had had problems with his marriage due to  his  drugs
    from the pregnancy of his second child  which  would  have  been  early
    2009.  On the Appellant's own evidence he had smoked cannabis for  some
    time, two of his brothers have been convicted of drug dealing  offences
    and in these circumstances I find that the Appellant was surrounded  by
    and involved in drugs. I do  not  accept  the  Appellant's  attempt  to
    portray his involvement in cannabis dealing as a very minor activity."


20.  The judge dealt with the comments  of  the  sentencing  judge  and  the
    evidence of AT's depression and  then  the  evidence  relating  to  his
    children. At paragraph 48 the judge stated:

         "48. In considering whether it is unduly harsh I must also consider
             the  Appellant's  immigration  and   criminal   history.   The
             Appellant has a long offending history which I  have  set  out
             above. The Appellant's evidence was that  he  had  a  troubled
             youth and now he is a  reformed  character.  I  disregard  the
             caution relating to shoplifting but I must give  consideration
             to the  Appellant's  conviction  when  he  was  14�  years  of
             wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm which involved
             hitting a man with a sword.  This is a  very  serious  offence
             and the Appellant was charged with attempted murder though  he
             was found not guilty of that  charge.  The  Appellant  rightly
             points out that this was his only  offence  of  violence.  The
             Appellant then remained crime-free  for  approximately  eleven
             years after which he was convicted of drink driving in 2010...


             Later in 2010  he  received  his  first  conviction  for  drug
             dealing and then in early 2011 he was  again  convicted  of  a
             drug dealing offence.  I  recognise  that  the  Appellant  has
             pleaded guilty to all these offences. I  also  recognise  that
             this last conviction was six years ago....
             I find that the Appellant's history of offending is  long  and
             varied.  I accept that the evidence  before  me  is  that  the
             Appellant is at low risk  to  the  public  but  the  Probation
             Service identifies that he was at medium risk  of  reoffending
             because of his connections to  the  drugs  world  in  a  drugs
             lifestyle...."

21.  The judge took into account the Appellant's length of lawful  residence
    in the UK and the warning  letter  from  the  Respondent  in  2002  and
    concluded that it  would  not  be  unduly  harsh  for  the  Appellant's
    children and wife to remain in the UK without the Appellant or for  the
    Appellant's children and wife to live in Northern Cyprus.


22.  At paragraph 56 the judge found:

         "56. I have considered paragraph 399A and Exception  1  in  Section
             117C(4). I find that at the date of the hearing the  Appellant
             has lived in the UK for the majority of his life even when his
             periods of imprisonment have been excluded.  I  consider  that
             the Appellant is culturally and socially integrated  into  the
             United Kingdom due to his fluency in the English language, his
             long period  of  residency  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  his
             employment.  This however does not  diminish  his  familiarity
             with the culture Northern Cyprus. I do not accept  that  there
             would be very significant obstacles to  his  integration  into
             northern Cyprus."


23.  The judge then gave her reasons  for  coming  to  that  conclusion  and
    recognised, at paragraph 57, the considerable weight to be attached  to
    the public interest in the Appellant's deportation.


24.  At paragraph 59 the judge stated:

         "59. I note that the Appellant's life and that of  his  family  has
             not been unlawful or precarious in terms of  Section  117B.  I
             find that the Appellant speaks English and he  has  a  job  so
             that he is financially  independent.  I  have  considered  the
             Appellant's and his  family's  circumstances,  the  children's
             best interests and whether the  circumstances  may  be  unduly
             harsh.  As set out above and for the reasons set out  above  I
             find that the  Appellant's  wife  and  children  returning  to
             Northern Cyprus with him or remaining in the UK without him is
             not unduly harsh.   I  remind  myself  of  the  provisions  of
             Section 117C of the 2002 Act and I find that  even  if  I  was
             required to consider Section 117C(3) Exceptions 1 and 2 do not
             apply for the reasons set out above. In  relation  to  Section
             117C(6) I consider in all of the circumstances and in light of
             my detailed findings  above  including  the  Appellant's  long
             residency in the United Kingdom, his  family  life,  the  best
             interests of his children, and even according him a  low  risk
             of  reoffending   that   there   are   not   very   compelling
             circumstances. I find that the deportation of the Appellant is
             proportionate to the public interest in his  deportation.  For
             completeness I note that the public  interest  in  deportation
             has several elements including the risk  of  reoffending,  the
             need to deter foreign criminals from committing serious crimes
             and  the  expression  of  society's  revulsion   at   criminal
             behaviour  and  the  building  and   maintenance   of   public
             confidence in the treatment of foreign criminals."


Relevant Law

25.  Section 117C provides as follows:

     "117C Article 8: Additional considerations in cases  involving  foreign
    criminals
 1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.
 2) The more serious the offence  committed  by  a  foreign  criminal,  the
    greater the public interest in deportation of the criminal.
 3) In the case of foreign criminal ('C') who has not been sentenced  to  a
    period of imprisonment for years or more, the public interest  requires
    C's deportation unless Exception 1 or Exception 2 applies.
 4) Exception 1 applies where -
 a) C has been lawfully resident in the United  Kingdom  for  most  of  C's
    life,
 b) C is socially and culturally integrated in the United Kingdom, and
 c) there would be very significant obstacles to C's integration  into  the
    country to which C is proposed to be deported
 5) Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship
    with  a  qualifying  partner  or  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect of C's deportation
    on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.
 6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to a period of
    imprisonment of at least  four  years,  the  public  interest  requires
    deportation unless there are very compelling  circumstances,  over  and
    above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2.
 7) The considerations in sub-sections (1) to (6)  are  to  be  taken  into
    account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to deport a
    foreign criminal only to the extent that the reason  for  the  decision
    was that the offence or  offences  for  which  the  criminal  has  been
    convicted.'
26.  In Johnson, the panel, Mr  Justice  Turner  and  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Jordan, held:

         "When a foreign offender has been convicted of an offence for which
         he has been sentenced to imprisonment of at least  four  years  and
         has successfully appealed on human rights grounds,  this  does  not
         prevent the Secretary of State from relying on the  conviction  for
         the purposes of paragraph  398(a)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and
         Section 117C of the 2002 Act if and when he reoffends even  if  the
         later offence results in less than  four  years'  imprisonment  or,
         indeed, less than twelve months' imprisonment."

27.  The panel made the following findings relevant to this appeal:


         "31.     ......Our conclusion is that, once the Appellant has  been
             sentenced to a term of imprisonment of four years or more,  he
             falls within the terms of paragraph 398(a) and  the  Secretary
             of State is entitled to rely upon it in  deciding  whether  or
             not to make  a  deportation  order.   It  is  no  bar  to  the
             Secretary of State that she  took  no  action  to  deport  the
             offender as a result of the conviction and sentence  nor  that
             the Appellant successfully appealed following  his  conviction
             and sentence. Such a claimant is no longer  entitled  to  rely
             upon the exceptions set out within Section 117C."


         "32.  It  is  impermissible  to  rely  upon  the  contents  of  the
             Respondent's own instructions to caseworkers  as  a  means  of
             interpreting  the  contents   of   a   statutory   instrument.
             Immigration Directorate Instructions (IDIs)  may  be  used  to
             identify a policy more favourable to  an  Appellant  than  the
             Immigration Rules but cannot impose requirements more  onerous
             to a claimant than the Rules.  Hence, the IDIs are of  limited
             use as a means of construction.   However,  the  relevant  IDI
             (Chapter 13) in this case is in  the  following  terms,  where
             material:


                  'Chapter 13: criminality guidance in Article 8 ECHR cases


                  2.2.2    Once a foreign criminal has been sentenced  to  a
                      period of at least four years' imprisonment, he  will
                      never  be  eligible  to  be  considered   under   the
                      exceptions. This applies even if deportation was  not
                      pursued at the time of the four year sentence because
                      there were very compelling  circumstances  such  that
                      deportation would have been disproportionate, and the
                      foreign criminal goes on to reoffend and is sentenced
                      to a period of imprisonment of less than four  years.
                      This is because his deportation will continue  to  be
                      conducive to  the  public  good  and  in  the  public
                      interest for the four year sentence as  well  as  any
                      subsequent sentences.'"




28.  In Rexha (S.117C - earlier offences) [2016] UKUT 335 (IAC),  the  panel
    of Mr Justice Dove and Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Grimes held:

         "The purpose and intention of Parliament in  incorporating  Section
         117C of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  was  to
         ensure that all of the criminal convictions providing a reason  for
         the deportation decision are to be examined  within  the  framework
         provided by that Section.


         What is required when undertaking the exercise required by Sections
         117C(1) to (6) is careful scrutiny of those offences which are on a
         person's criminal record which  have  provided  a  reason  for  the
         decision to deport.


         The IDIs do not fully reflect Section 117C(7) in  that  it  is  not
         necessarily the  case  that,  once  a  foreign  criminal  has  been
         convicted and sentenced to more than four years'  imprisonment,  he
         will never be eligible to be considered under the exceptions."

29.  At paragraphs 14 and 15 the panel concluded:

         "14. In our judgment the expression 'has  been  convicted'  in  the
             context  of  Section  117C(6)  and  (7)  does  not  limit  the
             application  of  that  Section  to   solely   the   conviction
             immediately prior to and prompting the making of a decision to
             deport. Whilst it may be said that the phrase is expressed  in
             the present perfect  tense,  we  can  see  little  sense  when
             examining the public interest identified  in  Section  117C(1)
             and (2)  to  limiting  the  application  of  these  provisions
             designed to protect the public interest  to  solely  the  most
             recent episode of criminal behaviour by a foreign criminal. We
             are satisfied that the purpose and intention of Parliament  in
             incorporating   this   Section   providing   for    additional
             considerations and specific treatment of foreign criminals was
             to ensure that all of the  criminal  convictions  providing  a
             reason for the deportation decision were to be examined within
             the framework provided by Section 117C."


         "15. We see no reason for construing Section  117C(7)  as  limiting
             the considerations relevant to  sub-Sections  (1)  to  (6)  to
             solely the most recent  offence  or  offences  for  which  the
             person has been convicted.  Firstly,  that  is  not  what  the
             Section expressly says. It does not  say  in  Section  117C(7)
             that only the offence or offences  immediately  prior  to  the
             deportation decision are to be taken into account.   Secondly,
             the use of the phrase 'only to the extent that the reason  for
             the decision  was  the  offence  or  offences  for  which  the
             criminal has been convicted' expressly requires an examination
             of the decision to identify  which  parts  of  the  criminal's
             antecedent history provide the basis  for  the  decision.   It
             will be a matter for the Respondent to  decide  in  each  case
             which parts of a candidate for deportation's criminal past  is
             to be relied upon in support of the making  of  a  deportation
             order.  It may well be that in the vast majority of cases  the
             totality of the criminal offending will provide the reason for
             the decision.  Equally, there may be cases where some  of  the
             person's criminal past could  not  properly  be  relied  upon.
             This could occur, for instance, because of their youth at  the
             time  of  the  offending  or  because  of  the  passage  of  a
             significant period of  time,  or  because  the  offending  was
             rooted in beliefs or circumstances now quite irrelevant to the
             justification for a deportation order being  made.   Thus,  in
             our view what is required  is  careful  scrutiny  pursuant  to
             Section 117C(7) of those offences which are  on  the  person's
             criminal record which have provided a reason for the  decision
             to deport.  All of those  convictions  are  then  relevant  to
             undertaking the exercise required by Section 117C(1) to (6)."

30.  At paragraph 18 the panel found: "Whilst in our view it  was  necessary
    for the Respondent to give  consideration  to  which  of  the  offences
    within the Appellant's criminal past were relied upon  as  reasons  for
    the  decision  to  deport  him,  the  Respondent  was   not,   in   the
    circumstances, precluded by Mr Bailey's findings from relying upon  the
    2002 conviction as part of the overall appraisal of the appropriateness
    of deportation in his case."


31.  The panel considered the guidance at paragraph 2.2.2 of  the  IDIs  and
    commented at paragraph 20: "The contents of the IDI have had no bearing
    on the construction of Section 117C that we have arrived at above.   We
    note that broadly  speaking  it  reflects  our  interpretation  of  the
    meaning of that Section to some extent. It is  not,  however,  entirely
    consistent with the interpretation since, for the reasons we  have  set
    out above, it is not necessarily the case that once a foreign  criminal
    has been convicted and sentenced to more than four years'  imprisonment
    that he will never be eligible to be considered under  the  Exceptions.
    The Secretary of State in reaching  her  decision  on  deportation  may
    conclude that that conviction and sentence should not properly  form  a
    reason for the decision to deport (for instance, for the reasons  which
    we set out above). In the light of the provisions of Section  117C  (7)
    that conviction would then not form part of the  exercise  required  by
    Section 117C (1) to (6). Since the IDI was drawn to  our  attention  we
    felt it appropriate to make this observation."


Discussion and Conclusions

32.  The issue in this appeal  is  a  narrow  one:  whether  the  judge  was
    entitled to take into account the entirety of the Appellant's offending
    behaviour in considering section  117C  when  the  Respondent  had  not
    relied on a previous conviction, in which the Appellant  was  sentenced
    to a period of more than four years' imprisonment,  in  coming  to  the
    decision to deport him under paragraph 398 of the Immigration Rules.

33.  In this case the Respondent relied on the Appellant's  last  conviction
    for which he was sentenced to a  term  of  imprisonment  of  more  than
    twelve  months.  Therefore,   Exceptions  1  and  2  of  section   117C
    (paragraphs 399 and 399A of the Immigration Rules) applied.

34.  Mr Jaisri argued that since the Respondent had not taken the course  of
    relying on the sentence of more than four years' imprisonment, the  GBH
    conviction, as the index offence giving rise to the decision to deport,
    then it was not open to  the  judge  to  consider  that  conviction  in
    assessing the public interest. The judge clearly had considered the GBH
    conviction when assessing the  public  interest  and  in  balancing  it
    against the Appellant's Article  8  rights.  It  was  accepted  by  all
    parties  that  she  had  taken  into  account  the  GBH  conviction  in
    considering whether the Appellant's deportation was unduly  harsh.  The
    question was whether she made an error of law in doing so.

35.  I am persuaded by Mr Melvin's submissions that,  on  reading  both  the
    authorities of Rexha and Johnson, the whole of the Appellant's criminal
    behaviour was relevant to any assessment under section 117C.  The  fact
    that it was not specifically relied on as the index offence giving rise
    to the decision to deport under paragraph 398 of the Immigration  Rules
    did not preclude the judge from taking it into account.

36.  The Respondent referred to all of the Appellant's criminal  convictions
    in her decision. She was entitled to rely on the GBH conviction in 1999
    for which the Appellant received a sentence of more than of four years,
    as the index offence. However, she did not do so and the Appellant  had
    the benefit of Exceptions 1 and 2.  The judge was entitled to take into
    account all Appellant's criminal convictions under section 117C(7).

37.  In any event, I find that any error of law was not material because  it
    is quite clear, from the paragraphs I have  set  out  above,  that  the
    judge dealt with the Appellant's drug dealing  in  assessing  the  best
    interests of the children and she attached significant weight  to  both
    of the convictions for supplying drugs. It is clear that  she  attached
    little weight to the GBH conviction because she  acknowledged  that  it
    was the Appellant's only offence of violence, he was 14 � years old and
    he remained crime free  for  a  period  of  11  years  thereafter.  The
    proportionality assessment  was  not  finely  balanced  in  this  case.
    Removing the GBH conviction from the proportionality balancing exercise
    would not result in a different decision.

38.  I find that there was no material error of law in the judge's  decision
    of 27th April 2017 and I dismiss the Appellant's appeal.
