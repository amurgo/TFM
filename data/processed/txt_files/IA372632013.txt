                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Snape promulgated on 3rd March 2014 following  a  hearing  at
        Sheldon  Court  in  Birmingham.  Having  considered  the  available
        evidence the Judge dismissed the appeal under the EEA Regulations.


     2. Permission to appeal was sought and granted on the basis the  Judge
        may arguably have erred  in  her  interpretation  of  a  'qualified
        person' in terms  of  paragraph  6  of  the  Immigration  (European
        Economic Area) Regulations 2006.


     3. This is an  appeal  in  which  the  Judge  clearly  considered  the
        evidence and relevant case law after which she made  the  following
        finding:


     21.  In accordance with the relevant Regulations, the  Appellant  needs
   to             show that her husband has been  exercising  Treaty  rights
   for a               continuous period of five years. In  support  of  her
   case the Appellant           has produced a letter from HMRC addressed to
   her husband dated            10 September 2013. The letter shows that  in
   2008 her husband earned               �3,752 from  Swan  Mill  Processing
   limited. In 2009, he earned �361              from ServiceMaster Contract
   Services, prior to which in 2008 his          earnings were  �4,865  from
   Sellers Engineering Ltd and �3,471 from            Swan  Mill  Processing
   Limited.


     4. The Judge found, having considered the evidence and the decision of
        the Upper Tribunal in Begum [2011]  UKUT  275,  that  she  was  not
        satisfied that the Appellant's husband's  activities  as  a  worker
        were other than "on such a small scale as to be regarded as  purely
        marginal and ancillary".


     5.  Before  the  Tribunal  today  the  Judge's  refusal  to   adjourn,
        specifically mentioned in paragraph 3  of  the  determination,  was
        attacked although there is no merit in a claim there has  been  any
        procedural unfairness sufficient to amount to an error of law.   In
        any event, permission to appeal was not given on this ground  which
        has not been raised prior to today's hearing.


     6. The question in issue is whether the findings made by the Judge are
        ones properly open to her on the evidence. The  evidence  that  was
        filed is limited and it cannot be said that  the  findings  of  the
        Judge are outside the range of findings that were available to  her
        on the evidence. No error of law has been established  in  relation
        to any misdirection of the law and the Judge's reasoning cannot  be
        said to not be adequate. It is a finding  that  the  Appellant  had
        failed to prove her case and no more.


     7. In addition to the case  of  Begum;  in  Mohammed  Barry  v  London
        Borough of Southwark (2008) EWCA Civ 1440 the Court of Appeal  said
        Community law gave the term worker a very  wide  interpretation.  A
        person might be a worker even though he worked for  less  than  the
        minimum wage and even if he only  worked  part  time.  The  service
        provided had to be real and actual and not marginal  or  subsidiary
        but the duration of the work in  the  relevant  period  was  not  a
        conclusive factor in deciding whether a person  was  a  worker  for
        community law purposes.  A  worker  might  in  the  course  of  his
        employment have a number of short  term  jobs.  The  fact  that  Mr
        Barry's work for Wimbledon was  of  short  term  duration  did  not
        deprive it of its ability to render him a worker.   That  work  was
        for economic value since if he had not  done  it  the  organisation
        would have employed someone else  to  do  it.   The  work  was  not
        ancillary to any other relationship between the Appellant  and  the
        organisation and it was not marginal - a significant sum  was  paid
        for it.


     8. In Kempf v Staatsecretaris van justite 19871  C.M.L.R  764  ECJ,  a
        case which  concerned  a  part-time  music  teacher  giving  twelve
        lessons a week topped up with Dutch Social Security  payments,  the
        ECJ held that so long as the work was 'effective  and  genuine'  he
        was a worker for Community purposes and  entitled  to  a  residence
        permit even if he was also receiving public funds.


     9. The failure of the Appellants husband to attend the hearing and  of
        the Appellant to provide adequate evidence meant  that  the  issues
        raised in the above cases could not  be  explored  further  by  the
        Judge.  Accordingly no error of law material  to  the  decision  to
        dismiss the appeal has been proved.  Discussions within the hearing
        indicated that a fresh application  is  to  be  made  supported  by
        better evidence which the  Secretary  of  State  will  be  able  to
        consider on its merits.


Decision

    10. There is no material error of law in the First-tier Tribunal
        Judge's decision. The determination shall stand.


   Anonymity.


    11. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules
        2005. I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008) as there was no application
        for anonymity which is not justified on the facts in any event.
