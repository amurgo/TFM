For the Respondent:    Miss H Aboni (Senior HOPO)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Hawden-Beal, promulgated on 6th July 2018, following a hearing on
    28th June 2018.  In the determination, the judge allowed the appeal  of
    the  Appellant,  whereupon   the   Respondent   Secretary   of   State,
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of India, born on 15th May 1955,  and  is  a
    female.  She is the spouse of a Mr [AS], who is an Indian citizen, with
    indefinite leave to remain in the UK.  She applied for leave to  remain
    on the basis of her dependency and  relationship  with  her  sponsoring
    husband.  The application was refused on 14th December 2017 because the
    Respondent was not satisfied that the Appellant met the suitability and
    eligibility requirements of  the  Rules,  in  that  the  Appellant  had
    fraudulently obtained  a  false  TOEIC  certificate,  and  displayed  a
    flagrant disregard of the public interest.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that she came to the UK in 2008.  She made her
    application in 2012 to remain here.  She knew the Respondent needed  an
    English language certificate.  She was not aware that she could not pay
    to avoid taking  the  test.   Someone  advised  her.   She  obtained  a
    certificate.  She was now remorseful and apologised for this.  She  was
    not aware of the system in this country.  She did not think  to  ask  a
    solicitor.  She was not educated.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge observed how the Appellant's sponsoring husband was 75  years
    old and she herself was 63 years old.  They both  had  medical  issues.
    They cannot return to India  because  they  have  no  accommodation  or
    employment such that they could support themselves.  This was the  case
    on behalf of the Appellant, as put before the  judge.   The  Respondent
    did not have regard to the medical evidence  even  though  it  was  put
    before the Secretary of State.  There was no mention of  this  evidence
    under the section on insurmountable obstacles.  There had also been  no
    proper consideration of the Appellant and her  husband's  circumstances
    as a senior couple.  Family life could not continue out of the  UK  and
    therefore  there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  under  EX.1.    Such
    circumstances existed because if the Appellant had to go back to India,
    the Sponsor could not support her application to return because he is a
    pensioner and would not have the finances to be able to bring her back.
     That would mean that the family would be separated permanently,  which
    in itself was disproportionate.  It was, therefore,  contended  on  her
    behalf that the appeal should be allowed on the basis that  there  were
    insurmountable  obstacles  and  the  Appellant's   removal   would   be
    disproportionate (see paragraphs 13 to 15 of the determination).

 5. The judge, against the background of the evidence before her, proceeded
    to apply the well-established case  law  in  relation  to  private  and
    family life, drawing attention to Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 and Hesham  Ali
    [2016] UKSC 60.  The judge took full  account  of  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant had admitted that she had engaged in fraudulent  activity  as
    far as  the  obtaining  of  a  TOEIC  certificate  was  concerned  (see
    paragraphs 23 to 26).  The judge also considered whether, the fact that
    she was 63 years of age, not educated, and had followed the  advice  of
    those who had tended it to her, meant that it would be  undesirable  to
    remove her (paragraph 26).  In this respect, the judge  concluded  that
    it was not desirable to allow the Appellant to remain (paragraph 27).

 6. However, the Respondent Secretary of State had "completely disregarded"
    the medical evidence that had been put in on her behalf (paragraph 27).
     Consideration was given to the fact that both the  Appellant  and  her
    sponsoring husband regularly returned to India for two weeks'  holidays
    and stayed there (paragraph 28).  However, visiting a country for three
    weeks was not the same as living there, even though the judge  was  not
    satisfied that the Sponsor's ill health was as bad as they  would  have
    the judge believe (paragraph 29).  The Appellant  also  had  a  son  in
    India (paragraph 30).  The judge concluded that there was  no  evidence
    before the Tribunal of any  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
    between the Appellant and her husband  continuing  outside  the  UK  in
    India (paragraph 30).

 7. The judge then went on to consider the fact that the  decision  may  be
    disproportionate in other respects.   The  sponsoring  husband  was  in
    receipt of a private pension of �140 per week, plus pension  credit  of
    some �33 per week, which equated to  an  annual  income  of  just  over
    �8,000.  However, he had to show an income of �18,600.  However, he had
    to show an income of �18,600, "which he will never be able to do which,
    in turn means that the Appellant if she goes back to India  will  never
    be able to join him here in the UK on a permanent  basis".  That  being
    so, the appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

 8. The grounds of application state that the  judge  erred  in  law  in  a
    number of respects.  First, the judge had  found  that  there  were  no
    insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing in India.   Yet  the
    appeal had then been allowed.  Second,  the  judge  had  concluded  (at
    paragraph 36) that the Sponsor's financial ability to support an  entry
    clearance application was an exceptional circumstance, but  it  is  not
    easy to see why this is so.  Consideration  had  to  be  given  to  the
    public interest and the Appellant had no right to remain in the UK  and
    did not speak English.  Her circumstances were not so exceptional  that
    her appeal should be allowed.  Third, her family life "was created at a
    time when the  Appellant  was  aware  that  her  stay  in  the  UK  was
    precarious ...".

 9. On 3rd August 2018, permission to appeal was granted on the basis  that
    the judge failed to give adequate reasons for allowing  the  appeal  on
    Article 8 grounds.

Submissions

10. At  the  hearing  before  me  on  4th  July  2019,  the  Appellant  was
    represented by Mr R Martin of Counsel.  He handed up the decision in TZ
    (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA Civ 1109, which the judge had  relied  upon  (at
    paragraph 13).  Mr Martin submitted that,

         "The  consideration  of  Article  8  outside   the   Rules   is   a
         proportionality  evaluation  i.e.  a  balance  of  public  interest
         factors.  Some factors are  heavily  weighted.   The  most  obvious
         example is the public policy in immigration  control.   The  weight
         depends on the legislative and factual context.  Whether someone is
         in the UK unlawfully  or  temporarily  and  the  reason  for  their
         circumstance will affect the weight  to  be  given  to  the  public
         interest in his or her removal and the weight to be given to family
         and/or private life ..." (paragraph 28).

11. Mr Martin submitted that this is exactly how the judge  had  proceeded.
    She had balanced out the various public interest factors.  She had come
    to the view as to which factors weighed heavily.  In this respect,  she
    had  concluded  that  although  there  was  no  initial  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life continuing in India as a factual  matter,  the
    circumstances of this  couple  were  that  the  Appellant's  sponsoring
    husband only had income that amounted to �8,000, and could not show the
    �18,600 needed to sponsor her return back to the UK.   That  being  so,
    the judge had concluded that "he will never be able" to sponsor her and
    she "will never be able to join him here  in  the  UK  on  a  permanent
    basis" (paragraph 35).  That was an important  observation  given  that
    the  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  had   a   genuine   and   subsisting
    relationship.  Moreover, the Grounds of Appeal were entirely  wrong  in
    submitting  that  their  relationship  was  formed  at  a   time   when
    immigration status  was  precarious,  because  it  was  a  longstanding
    relationship that had arisen in India, prior to the couple's arrival in
    the UK.  That too was an important factor.  The  judge  had  looked  at
    everything carefully in the round and concluded in a  manner  that  was
    open to her.

12. For her part, Miss Aboni submitted that the  judge  had  erred  in  two
    respects.  First, the judge  had  already  found  that  there  were  no
    insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  continuing  in  India.   The
    Appellant could not  satisfy  the  English  language  requirements  and
    therefore the public interest condition was not satisfied.   The  judge
    had in terms concluded that, "I find that the decision  to  refuse  her
    application for further leave to remain  to  be  justified"  (paragraph
    33).  Second, in allowing the appeal under Article  8,  the  judge  had
    failed to give proper regard to Section 117B  and  the  fact  that  the
    Secretary of State had a constitution  of  responsibility  to  maintain
    immigration  control  and  that  this  was  an  important   factor   in
    immigration decisions.

No Error of Law

13. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.  First,  it  is  well-established
    that the threshold for  demonstrating  that  the  decision  reached  is
    "perverse" is a high one, and all too often,  as  Lord  Justice  Brooke
    made clear in R (Iran) [1985], practitioners use the term loosely  when
    there is no perversity in the decision below.  This is a case where the
    judge has indeed considered every single aspect of the claim before her
    in a thoughtful and deliberate manner.  In fact, throughout the bulk of
    the determination, the judge veers firmly in favour of the Secretary of
    State, and the public interest in immigration control,  even  observing
    that there were no insurmountable obstacles to family  life  continuing
    in India.

14.  Second,  however,  having  looked  at  the  position   following   the
    Appellant's  removal  to  India,  the  judge  had  concluded  that  the
    sponsoring husband's inability to show an income of �18,600, would mean
    that they would be separated "on a  permanent  basis"  and  that  under
    Article 8 this would be a disproportionate outcome for a couple who are
    aged 75 years and 63 years.  Indeed, the judge at this stage  comes  to
    the conclusion that, "The Appellant cannot meet the requirements of the
    Immigration Rules but the consequences of not being able to do so  will
    be unjustifiably harsh for the Sponsor"  (paragraph  36).   That  is  a
    conclusion that the judge was entitled to come to.

15. In fact, if regard is had to Agyarko [2017] UKSC 1, there  the  Supreme
    Court explained that the Secretary of State "has not imposed a test  of
    exceptionality in the sense that the case should  exhibit  some  highly
    unusual feature", but that had  on  the  contrary,  "defined  the  word
    'exceptional', as already explained, as meaning circumstances in  which
    refusal would  result  in  unjustifiable  harsh  consequences  for  the
    individual such that the  refusal  of  the  application  would  not  be
    proportionate" (see paragraph 60).

16. That is, indeed, precisely how the judge came to  the  conclusion  that
    the Appellant would succeed under freestanding Article 8 jurisprudence.
     The judge was entitled to come to that conclusion.  There is no  error
    of law in the decision.

Notice of Decision

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point of law.  The decision shall stand.

18. No anonymity direction is made.

19. The appeal is allowed.
