For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwnycz, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.    The  Appellant,  a  national  of   Albania,   appealed   against   the
    Respondent's decision to make removal directions under  Section  10  of
    the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, an asylum and human  rights  based
    claim having been refused.  The decision of 26 March 2015  as  appealed
    came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  R  E  Barrowclough  who,  on  21
    December 2015, dismissed  the  appeal  under  the  Refugee  Convention,
    Humanitarian Protection and Article 8 ECHR grounds.

2.   The judge made an anonymity order which has continued.   Permission  to
    appeal was given by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  McDade  on  21  January
    2016.

3.   The principal criticism of the judge is that  his  analysis  failed  to
    properly assess the risk on return of the Appellant as a  single  woman
    with her children in terms of societal, family and other discrimination
    and persecution likely to be faced because of her  status.   The  issue
    was not one of whether single women with children  faced  the  risk  of
    societal discrimination or state discrimination  or  faced  persecution
    for a Convention reason but whether or not the Appellant with reference
    to findings of fact was shown to be such a person.  The judge,  in  the
    decision [D19-26], concluded that the Appellant's claim was simply  not
    believable, the Appellant was telling untruths, her account  was  false
    and that none of it was believed vis-ï¿½-vis her claim to  be  trafficked
    or put to work as a sex worker against her will.

4.   The judge said this:

         "24.  The inescapable effect of this  overwhelming  damage  to  the
             Appellant's credibility in relation to virtually  all  aspects
             of her account is that it is impossible, I find, to place  any
             reliance on anything she said, either in her  interviews,  her
             witness statement or her oral evidence to the  Tribunal,  save
             where  it  is  expressly   supported   and   corroborated   by
             independent evidence; which,  in  the  circumstances  of  this
             case, Immigration Rules practically non-existent.  It follows,
             in my judgement, that  the  Appellant  has  got  nowhere  near
             proving even to the relatively modest standard required,  that
             she is at risk from Alban  (assuming  he  even  exists,  about
             which I remain in doubt), or from her husband or her family if
             she or her children are returned to Albania. Whilst  there  is
             certainly evidence that trafficking for  sexual  exploitation,
             and domestic violence and abuse are present and  not  uncommon
             in Albanian society, the Appellant's evidence and account  is,
             in my judgement so unreliable and flawed that she  has  failed
             to establish or prove that she either has been  or is at  risk
             of being a victim of either. Additionally, it  is  uncontested
             that the Appellant's eldest child was born within wedlock; and
             given the  chronology  set  out  above,  it  is  by  no  means
             impossible that her younger child was as well.   I  note  that
             both children  have  been   given  and  bear  the  Appellant's
             husband's name.  Since I do not accept the Appellant's account
             of her past life, and am unconvinced by  her  account  of  her
             dispute with her husband and her association with Alban Likaj,
             the perils and  dangers  normally  associated  with  returning
             single woman accompanied by illegitimate children to  Albania,
             and  the  difficulties  associated  with  internal  relocation
             there, do not arise or apply.


         25.   Accordingly in my judgement the Appellant has  not  succeeded
             in proving to the required  standard  that  she  has  a  well-
             founded fear of persecution if returned  to  Albania,  or  the
             existence of substantial grounds for believing that she  would
             face  a  real  risk  of  suffering  serious   harm   in   that
             eventuality.  It follows therefore that both  the  Appellant's
             claim for asylum and  humanitarian  protection  fail  and  her
             appeal must be dismissed. I find that the  Appellant  has  not
             discharged the burden of proof of having a  well-founded  fear
             of  persecution  for  a  Convention  reason   and   that   the
             Appellant's removal would cause the United Kingdom  to  be  in
             breach of its obligations under the 1951 Convention."

5.   For the same  reasons  the  judge  rejected  the  claimant's  need  for
    humanitarian protection or the risk of Articles 2 or 3 proscribed  ill-
    treatment.

6.   Mr Khan says that the judge  failed  to  make  a  specific  finding  of
    whether the Appellant was still married and/or with her husband because
    that was material as to how her presence would be assessed on a  return
    to Albania.  It is correct to say the judge does not  make  a  specific
    finding that the Appellant remains married but the inevitable inference
    to be drawn from the way the judge's consideration [D24 and 25]  of  is
    that she did remain married, and it is plain that  the  judge  did  not
    think the Appellant would be returning as a single woman unaccompanied,
    other than by children, and thus therefore at risk either from her  own
    family or indeed third parties.

7.   Indeed I find the wording  [D24]   clear  beyond  any  doubt  that  the
    judge's finding that the Appellant was not at risk to that low standard
    of proof applied in Refugee Convention claims from a man  called  Alban
    or from her husband or  from  her  family  if  the  Appellant  and  her
    children were returned to Albania.

8.   In  those  circumstances  it  seemed  to  me  that  the  only  sensible
    inference that can  be  drawn  is  that  the  Appellant  would  not  be
    returning as a single woman bereft of  husband and at  the  mercies  of
    her family who would now look upon her in a different light as a single
    unaccompanied woman other than by children.

9.   The judge made sufficiently reasoned findings that he  did  not  accept
    the Appellant's account of her past life nor  her  account  of  dispute
    with her husband nor her association with Alban, nor did the perils and
    dangers normally associated with a returning single woman apply to this
    Appellant.  It is not for me to go behind the judge's findings of fact.
     Despite Mr Khan's best efforts it simply seemed to me that the  ground
    is really trying to reargue the merits of  the  case.   Indeed  further
    evidence was prepared on the basis that it  was  thought  there  was  a
    resumed hearing today essentially to reargue those factual issues.

10.  I find the Original Tribunal  made  no  error  of  law.   The  Original
    Tribunal's decision stands. The appeal is dismissed.

11.   An  anonymity  order  was  previously  made.   I  agree  to  it  being
    continued.

DIRECTION REGARDING ANONYMITY - RULE 14 OF  THE  TRIBUNAL  PROCEDURE  (UPPER
TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
