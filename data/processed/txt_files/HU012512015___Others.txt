Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr N Garrod, Counsel instructed by Staines &
Campbells
     Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appeal of the appellants, [Clovis H] and  her  husband  and
    children, against in her case the decision of the respondent of 5  June
    2015 and I think that may be the decision that applies  to  the  entire
    family refusing applications for leave to remain in the United Kingdom.
     The appeal was heard by Judge Courtney at  Hatton  Cross  in  November
    last year and all the appeals were dismissed.

2.   In the grounds of appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  respect  of
    which permission was granted by Judge McClure, the essential  point  is
    that at paragraph 3 referring to the respondent's policy of August 2015
    which it may be helpful if I quote:-

         "11.2.3. Would it be unreasonable to expect a British Citizen child
                  to leave the UK?  Save in cases involving criminality, the
                  decision maker must not take a decision in relation to the
                  parent or primary carer of a British Citizen  child  where
                  the effect of that decision would be to force that British
                  child to leave the EU,  regardless  of  the  age  of  that
                  child.   This  reflects  the  European  Court  of  Justice
                  judgment in Zambrano."

3.   The relevance of this is with respect  to  the  first  two  appellants'
    eldest child, [IC], who was born in [ ] 2006 and at a point before  the
    decision was made in this case had become a British citizen, so she  is
    a British citizen child to whom the policy is relevant  in  this  case,
    and as I say, Judge McClure granted permission on that basis, and today
    very helpfully Mr Jarvis on behalf of the Secretary  of  State  accepts
    that there is an error of law in the judge's decision in  this  regard,
    although as he says the policy may perhaps go beyond what  is  required
    by Zambrano.  In fact, the facts of this case  fall  very  much  within
    Zambrano I think in that neither parent has any settled status  in  the
    United Kingdom and there are decisions refusing them leave  to  remain.
    The case then falls squarely within the policy.

4.   The judge erred in law and as Mr Garrod, on behalf of  the  appellants,
    points out there seems little need for anything more to  be  said  than
    that the consequence of the error is in a sense  the  remaking  of  the
    decision as well.

Notice of Decision

5.   In light of the policy and its application to the facts of  this  case,
    it is clear in my view that  the  appeal  falls  to  be  allowed  under
    Article 8 and therefore for the judge's decision dismissing the appeal,
    this substituted a decision allowing it under Article 8.

No anonymity direction is made.
