Representation:

For the appellant:         Ms Z Harper, of Counsel, instructed  by  Birnberg
                 Peirce & Partners
For the respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Presenting Officer.

                           Decision and Directions


 1. This is an appeal  against  a  decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  Abebrese  who,  following  a  hearing  on  11  October  2019,
    dismissed the appellant's appeal against a decision of  the  respondent
    of 16 May 2019 to refuse his asylum, humanitarian protection and  human
    rights claims of 14 March 2018.

 2. There were five grounds of appeal. It is only necessary to mention  the
    following:

     i)  Ground 1: This ground advanced three  separate  points  but  it  is
          only necessary to mention the first which  may  be  summarised  as
          follows: The judge  did  not  consider  the  medical  evidence  in
          reaching his conclusions on the appellant's credibility, rejecting
          the corroborative value of the  medical  evidence  after  deciding
          that the appellant's account lacked credibility.

     ii) Ground 4: The judge erred in  his  consideration  of  the  risk  of
         suicide, in that, he made no findings on the evidence regarding the
         appellant's psychiatric condition, failed to consider that evidence
         with reference to J v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 629, failed  to  provide
         reasons for his conclusion  that  the  impact  of  removal  on  the
         appellant's mental health would not reach the threshold for Article
         3 and Article 8 and failed to  make  sustainable  findings  on  the
         availability of treatment in Afghanistan to mitigate the  risks  to
         his mental health.

 3. At the hearing before me, Ms Everett agreed that the judge had erred in
    law, as summarised above in relation to grounds 1 and 4, as well  as  2
    and 5 as set out in the written grounds and not summarised  above.  She
    accepted that the errors of law were material and, in particular,  that
    ground 1 was fatal to the judge's credibility assessment. She  accepted
    that the judge's decision fell to be set aside in its entirety. In  her
    view, the appeal should be remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  Ms
    Harper also requested that the appeal be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 4. I agree that the judge had erred in law as contended in grounds 1, 2, 4
    and 5. In relation to the ground as summarised at para 2.i) above  (one
    of the three grounds raised in ground 1), the judge considered  various
    credibility points at paras 26-32 and then said, at para 33 as follows:

         "33. Therefore on the basis of the above findings  the  appellant's
             account of the incidents with the Taliban are not accepted and
             I am of the view that any  specific  threats  relate  to  [the
             appellant's brother] and not to the appellant."

 5. At para 36, the judge said:

         "36. I consider  all  of  the  medical  evidence  provided  by  the
             appellant and I am of the view that due to lack of credibility
             of the core of  the  appellant's  account  that  they  do  not
             corroborate the appellant's claim."

 6. It is therefore plain, from paras 26-36 of the judge's decision that he
    reached his adverse credibility findings on the appellant's accounts of
    the basis of his asylum claim without taking into account  the  medical
    evidence and that, having reached his adverse credibility findings,  he
    rejected the potentially corroborative value of the  medical  evidence.
    He therefore put the cart before the horse and committed the same error
    as did the Special Adjudicator in R v  Special  Adjudicator,  ex  parte
    Virjon B [2002] EWCA Civ 1302, an authority referred to in the grounds.
    A more recent and better known  authority  is  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    judgment in Mibanga [2005] EWCA Civ 367 in which the  Court  of  Appeal
    said that the judge in that  case  had  used  her  adverse  credibility
    findings as justification for dismissing the medical evidence.

 7. Taken on its own, this part  of  ground  1  is  fatal  to  the  judge's
    credibility assessment in relation to the appellant's protection claim,
    irrespective of the merits of the remaining grounds.

 8. In relation to ground 4, the judge  considered  the  appellant's  human
    rights claim based on his medical condition at para  42,  the  relevant
    part of which reads:

         "42. ... I  am  also  of  the  view  that  the  appellant  has  not
             established a claim under Article  3  of  ECHR  and  that  the
             report of Dr. Guistozzi does indicate that  medical  treatment
             is available to the appellant in Afghanistan even though  they
             may not be of the same standard and less widespread throughout
             the country. I referred  myself  to  paragraph  78-90  of  the
             report. The appellant could also relocate  to  Kabul  and  the
             central highlands of the country the appellant would face high
             cost of living and  difficulties  in  employment  nevertheless
             these are options for him. I referred myself to paragraphs 75-
             77 of the report."

 9. It is not enough for the judge simply to have said that he had referred
    himself  to  various  paragraphs  of  Dr.  Guistozzi's  report  without
    explaining how Dr. Guistozzi's evidence featured in  his  consideration
    of the report of Dr Neil Egnal concerning the appellant's mental health
    condition and the risk of suicide and how he had applied the  Court  of
    Appeal's guidance on this issue in J v SSHD.

10. Ground 4 is therefore plainly established. It is fatal to  the  judge's
    assessment of the appellant's Article 3  claim  based  on  his  medical
    condition and his related Article 8 claim.

11. It follows that the whole of the judge's  decision  stands  to  be  set
    aside. I therefore set aside the decision  of  Judge  Abebrese  in  its
    entirety. It is therefore necessary for the decision on the  appeal  to
    be re-made on the merits on all issues.

12. In the majority of cases, the Upper Tribunal  when  setting  aside  the
    decision will re-make the relevant decision itself.  However, para  7.2
    of the Practice Statements for the Immigration and Asylum  Chambers  of
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  the  Upper  Tribunal   (the   "Practice
    Statements") recognises that it may  not  be  possible  for  the  Upper
    Tribunal to proceed to re-make the decision when it is satisfied that:

         "(a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the
             First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for
             that party's case to be put to and considered by the First-
             tier Tribunal; or

         (b)  the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which is
             necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-
             made is such that, having regard to the overriding objective
             in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case to the First-
             tier Tribunal."

13. Given the evidence filed in this case, in particular the expert reports
    including the medical evidence, I  agree  with  the  parties  that  the
    nature and extent of the judicial fact-finding  that  is  necessary  is
    such that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2,  it  is
    appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  errors  on
points of law such that the decision is set aside. This case is remitted  to
the First-tier Tribunal for the decision on the appellant's appeal to be re-
made on the merits on all issues by a judge other than Judge of  the  First-
tier Tribunal Abebrese.
