                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria, born on  7  March  1984.   On  4
    March 2013 he entered with  student  leave  to  pursue  studies  for  a
    Master's Degree in Bio-Technology.  The course finished in August  2014
    but the Appellant had failed certain aspects and on the day before  his
    leave expired he applied for further leave to enable  him  to  complete
    his studies.  On 27 November 2014 the Respondent refused the  applicant
    further leave to remain as a  Tier  4  (General)  Student  Migrant  for
    general grounds relying on  paragraph  322  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    because the Respondent considered the Appellant had failed to  disclose
    that he had been "convicted of  possessing/controlling  article(s)  for
    use in fraud(s) on April 2014 and making false representation to make a
    gain for self or  another  on  29  April  2014  at  North  West  London
    Magistrate's Court".

The First-tier Tribunal Proceedings

 2. On 11 December 2014 the Appellant lodged notice of appeal under Section
    82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as amended  (the
    2002 Act).  The grounds did not deny the conviction and  asserted  that
    the Appellant had been advised by the solicitors who had acted for  him
    in the criminal proceedings by way of a letter that in respect of  both
    offences he had been sentenced to a conditional discharge for two years
    and that if he was asked if he had been convicted of an offence he  was
    entitled to reply in the negative.  If he  was  asked  whether  he  had
    committed an offence or been guilty of an offence then he would have to
    disclose  the  fact  that  he  had  been  sentenced  to  a  conditional
    discharge. A copy of the solicitor's letter was attached to the  Notice
    of Appeal.

 3. By a decision promulgated on 19 March  2015  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Stott found that the Appellant had failed to disclose  in  his
    application  for  further  leave  his  convictions  and  so  had   made
    misrepresentations in his application. He dismissed the appeal.

 4. On 1 June 2015 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal and Lambert refused the
    Appellant permission to appeal. The Appellant renewed  his  application
    for permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  tribunal.  In  his  renewed
    application for permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  he  stated
    that he would be graduating on 23 July and "after that I will  be  gone
    for good. Please I don't want to stay any more."

 5. On 3 August 2014 Upper Tribunal Judge  Plimmer  granted  the  Appellant
    permission to appeal on the basis that it was arguable  the  Judge  had
    failed to apply the learning in Omenma (Conditional discharge -  not  a
    conviction of an offence) [2014] UKUT 314 (IAC).

 6. In her response of 20  August  2015  under  Rule  24  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, the Respondent stated  that  she
    did not oppose the application for permission to appeal and invited the
    Upper Tribunal to allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules  in  the
    light of the decision in Omenma.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

 7. The Appellant was unrepresented when he attended the hearing.   He  had
    not been able successfully to  complete  his  studies  and  obtain  his
    Master's Degree but he had obtained a Post-graduate  Diploma.   He  had
    been unable to focus on his studies because the Respondent had retained
    his passport and  he  had  been  unable  to  take  on  any  employment.
    Additionally, he had been the victim of a theft.  This had  meant  that
    he had been unable to obtain money to travel to return  home.   In  the
    meantime he had managed to survive by borrowing money from friends  and
    incurring debts on his credit card.

 8. I referred to the Respondent's response under Rule 24.  For the reasons
    given by Upper Tribunal Judge Plimmer in her  grant  of  permission,  I
    find the Judge's decision contains an error of law such that it  should
    be set aside and I re-make the decision allowing the Appellant's appeal
    against the Respondent's refusal  to  grant  him  further  leave  as  a
    student.

 9. The Respondent when considering the length of leave to be  granted  the
    Appellant in the light of my decision, may wish to  take  into  account
    the information that the Appellant gave to the Tribunal.

NOTICE OF DECISION

    The appeal is allowed on immigration grounds.

    No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT: FEE AWARD

The appeal has been allowed and so I have considered whether to make  a  fee
award.  Having regard to all the  circumstances  and  the  reasons  for  the
appeal being allowed, I consider a partial fee award of ï¿½70 is  appropriate.
