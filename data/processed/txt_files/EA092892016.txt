                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction

      1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision  of  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge S J Walker who  in  a  decision  promulgated  on  13
         September 2017 dismissed his  appeal  against  a  decision  of  the
         Respondent refusing to issue a residence card to the  Appellant  as
         an extended family member under the Immigration (European  Economic
         Area) Regulations 2006.

      2. I do not need to set out the background to this  case  because  the
         parties agree that the decision of Judge Walker  cannot  stand  for
         the reasons given below.

      3. The First-tier Tribunal concluded that it had  no  jurisdiction  to
         entertain the appeal following the case of  Sala  (EFMs:  Right  of
         Appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411.

      4. In the light of Khan v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
         [2017] EWCA Civ 1755, the First-tier Tribunal was wrong in  law  to
         conclude that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

      5. I therefore set aside the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
         pursuant  to  section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals,   Courts   and
         Enforcement Act 2007. I remit the case to the  First-tier  Tribunal
         at Taylor House for a hearing of the Appellant's appeal on  a  date
         to be notified.

    Decision

    The Appellant's appeal against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    is allowed. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Taylor
    House to be heard on the next available date  by  a  judge  other  than
    Judge S J Walker.




    Signed       Date: 22 March 2018
