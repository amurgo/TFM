                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1) The parties are as above, but this determination refers to them  as  they
   were in the First-tier Tribunal.

2) The SSHD appeals against a determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
   Lea, promulgated on 5 November 2013, dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal
   under the Immigration Rules, but allowing it under Article 8 of the ECHR.
    The grounds are  that  Article  8  provides  no  general  discretion  to
   dispense with the requirements of the Rules; that there is no human right
   to remain in the UK to work; and that Article 8 is not  a  means  whereby
   the Rules may be ignored or rewritten  because  a  judicial  fact  finder
   regards a person as having only narrowly failed to comply.

3) Those grounds disclose error of law  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The
   European Charter is "for the protection of human rights  and  fundamental
   freedoms."  The ground of appeal under section 84(1)(c) of the  2002  Act
   is that "the decision is unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act
   1998 ... as being incompatible with the appellant's  Convention  rights."
   It is necessary in a case involving qualified rights to show a real  risk
   of flagrant denial or gross violation, where  the  very  essence  of  the
   right will be completely denied or nullified in the destination  country.
   After applying the Rules, only if there are  arguably  good  grounds  for
   granting leave outside them is it necessary to go on to consider  whether
   there are compelling circumstances not recognised under them.   If  there
   are no insurmountable obstacles to relocation, it has to  be  shown  that
   there are particular features such that  removal  will  be  unjustifiably
   harsh.  Article 8 cannot be used to excuse near misses.

4) The judge at �28 found the interference  in  this  case  disproportionate
   because it was not in the public interest, but that was to use Article  8
   for a purpose for which the right of appeal under the Convention  is  not
   intended, and which goes beyond the case law on the  circumstances  under
   which an Article 8 ground outwith the Immigration Rules  may  be  upheld.
   This might have been a "hard" case (cf Allam [2012] EWCA Civ 960  at  �45
   and Rodriguez [2014] EWCA Civ 2  at  �100)  but  it  was  not  one  which
   entitled a judge to allow it outwith the Rules.

5) However, all was not lost for the appellant.  Mr Stevenson raised  a  new
   point in his written submission received by the Upper Tribunal on 9  July
   2014.  The application in this case  was  made  on  4  January  2013  and
   decided on 17 April 2013.   The provisions for implementation  of  HC1039
   say that the changes take  effect  on  6  April  2013,  subject  to  sub-
   paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).  This application fell under paragraph  281.
   Sub-paragraph  (a)  of  the  provisions  for  implementation  applies  to
   paragraph 281, while (b) and (c) do not.  Sub-paragraph (a)  applies  "if
   an applicant has made an application ... on or after 6 April 2013 using a
   certificate of sponsorship ... assigned by his sponsor ... before 6 April
   2013."  The certificate in this case was assigned before that  date,  but
   the application was not made on or after 6 April 2013.  This  application
   having  been  made  prior  to  that  date,  and  there  being  no   other
   transitional provision applicable, it should have been decided  according
   to the Rules as amended on 6 April 2013, and should have  resulted  in  a
   grant of leave.

6) Mr Stevenson had sent a copy of his submission also to the respondent  in
   advance of the hearing, but unfortunately this had not been  received  by
   Mrs Saddiq.  I allowed her 20 minutes to consider the new point.   Having
   had an opportunity to do so, she offered  no  argument  against  it,  but
   asked for an adjournment to consider the matter further  because  it  was
   novel and she wished to take instructions.  I had some sympathy with  her
   position, but the case has a history of  previous  adjournments  and  the
   point although novel is essentially a short one, once identified.  I  was
   not willing to adjourn further.

7) The point is of a nature which should  be  allowed  even  although  taken
   late.  If the respondent should on a correct reading of the  transitional
   provisions have allowed the application in  the  first  place,  then  its
   refusal should not stand.  I agree with Mr  Stevenson's  submission  that
   the application should have been decided with reference  to  the  amended
   Rules.  It is common ground that, if so, it should have been granted.

8) The determination of the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside,  and  the
   following decision is substituted.   The  appeal  is  allowed  under  the
   Immigration Rules, but would not have succeeded under Article 8.
