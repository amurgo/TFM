For the Respondent:    No appearance


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer, Islamabad  against  a
    decision of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal ("AIT")  issued  on  04
    June 2007 allowing the claimant's appeal against the decision  made  on
    15 October 2006 refusing to grant him entry clearance as a visitor.  In
    this determination we will refer to the parties as they were before the
    AIT, the entry clearance officer as the respondent and the claimant  as
    the appellant.

 2. There has been a most unfortunate delay in this appeal  being  relisted
    for hearing. The application by the appellant  for  a  visit  visa  was
    refused on 15 October  2006.  His  appeal  against  that  decision  was
    allowed on 04 June 2007 but the respondent applied for and was  granted
    an order for reconsideration notified to the parties on 25  June  2007.
    The appeal was listed for hearing on 10 August 2007 but adjourned.  The
    file has been inactive ever since, neither  party  making  any  enquiry
    about a fresh hearing date.

 3. The file came to light again in March 2014 and on 1 May 2014  a  notice
    of hearing was issued for 20 May 2014. As the appellant's last notified
    address was in Lahore, Pakistan this was not  adequate  notice  and  we
    have deferred making our decision until 56 days has  expired  from  the
    date the notice was issued. No response  has  been  received  from  the
    appellant and we now proceed to reconsider his matter  which   proceeds
    by virtue  of  transitional  provisions  as  an  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Background

 4. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on  15  October  1968,  who
    sought entry to the UK as a visitor to attend  a  Digital  Print  World
    Exhibition in London between 17 and 19 October  2006.  His  application
    was refused as the respondent was not satisfied that  he  had  produced
    satisfactory evidence that he  had  legitimate  business  interests  or
    contacts that required his presence in the  UK  leading  him  to  doubt
    whether the circumstances of the trip were as  claimed.  The  appellant
    had stated that he was married with three children and earned Rs 125000
    a month (�1100) but had �4000 available to spend on the trip to the UK.
    The respondent did not consider this  expenditure  to  be  commensurate
    with his economic circumstances. The appellant had failed to submit his
    personal bank statements and had only submitted company statements. The
    respondent  was  therefore  not  satisfied   that   he   had   produced
    satisfactory evidence of his personal and  financial  circumstances  in
    Pakistan. For these reasons he was not satisfied that the appellant was
    genuinely seeking entry as a visitor for a limited period  or  that  he
    intended to leave the UK at the end of his proposed stay.

 5. The appellant filed a notice of appeal against  this  decision,  saying
    that he was self employed, he owned his own printing business in Lahore
    and his assets included a house valued at Rs 5 million. He said he  had
    been invited to a conference by the International  Council  of  Graphic
    Design Associations, an organisation based in Montreal.  He  had  money
    set aside for the visit and had no intention of staying in  the  UK  in
    the light of his family responsibilities in Pakistan.

 6. The decision was reviewed by a senior officer and  was  confirmed.  The
    appellant's appeal was not a full right of appeal but  was  limited  to
    the grounds set out in  s.84  (1)  (b)  and  (c)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, namely that the decision was  unlawful
    by virtue of s.19B of the Race Relations Act 1976 or unlawful under s.6
    of the Human Rights Act 1998 as being incompatible with the appellant's
    Convention rights.

 The Judge's Findings

 7. The judge noted that appellant only had a limited right of  appeal  and
    said in [8] of his decision that the only relevant legislation on which
    he could rely was s.6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 namely that a public
    authority should not act  contrary  to  the  ECHR  and  that  the  only
    possible article relevant to the application was article 6,  the  right
    to a fair and public hearing.

 8. The judge approached this issue as follows:

     "11. The first question to be asked is whether there  is  evidence  to
    establish if                                                        the
    appellant's appeal does in fact engage the European Convention of Human
    Rights. This has to depend on whether the respondent can show  that  he
    or she  has  carefully  considered  and  evaluated  all  the  documents
    submitted by the appellant in support of his  application.  Only  then,
    can the decision said  to  be  "fair".  I  will  therefore  review  the
    evidence and come to my conclusion on that matter, before coming to any
    conclusion on whether the appeal should be allowed or dismissed on  its
    merits,  if  there  are  grounds  to  invoke  the  1998  Act  and   the
    accompanying ECHR."

 9. The judge reviewed the documentary evidence which had been submitted in
    support of the application and in  [15]  said  that  he  was  perfectly
    satisfied that there was satisfactory evidence of  legitimate  business
    interests in that his bank clearly confirmed that the appellant was the
    sole proprietor of his business and the respondent should have accepted
    that the appellant had full power over that bank account. The  business
    was a firm, not a company  and  was  therefore  not  a  separate  legal
    identity. The judge said that this was a very important fact.  He  then
    said at [16] :

     "All this shows is that the respondent has not  fully  understood  and
    comprehended the documents in support of the  application.  Given  that
    the decision was reviewed, albeit only on the grounds of appeal and not
    on the documents submitted with the original application, I  find  this
    to be very unfortunate, if not unprofessional. The appellant  has  been
    denied  an  opportunity  to  advance  his  business  by  attending  the
    exhibition in London."

10. The Judge went on to conclude that article 6 of the ECHR applied and he
    was satisfied that the burden of proof had been  discharged.  In  these
    circumstances he held that all the requirements of para 41  of  HC  395
    were met and the decision was not in accordance  with  the  Immigration
    Rules and Human Rights Act legislation and  he  therefore  allowed  the
    appeal.






Submissions

11.  After the  order  for  reconsideration  further  representations  were
    received from the appellant on 20 July 2007. He asked for  the  judge's
    decision to be sustained. He said that he had obviously  been  deprived
    of the chance to grow and enhance his business by the refusal of  entry
    clearance and in consequence his trade and business had suffered. There
    were a number of events he could not attend due to this refusal and  he
    referred to future events and conferences which he had hoped to attend.
    Ms Holmes submitted that the judge's decision was plainly wrong and  an
    appeal on human rights grounds could not simply be used  as  a  vehicle
    for a full appeal on the merits.

The Error of Law

12. We must consider whether the judge erred in law such that the  decision
    should be set aside. When basing his decision on article 6,  the  judge
    failed to take into account the fact that ECtHR has held in  Maaouia  v
    France 33 EHRR 42 that article  6  has  no  application  to  "decisions
    regarding the entry, stay or deportation of  aliens  as  these  do  not
    concern civil rights or a criminal charge". There  was,  therefore,  no
    power to review the merits of the decision under article 6.   The  fact
    that this article does not apply does  not  of  course  mean  that  the
    respondent is not bound by the common  law  duty  of  fairness  in  the
    decision making process: see Thakur (PBS decision: common law fairness)
    Bangladesh [2011] UKUT 151 but in any event there was no  proper  basis
    on which it could be said that the  respondent  did  not  observe  that
    obligation. The respondent reached a decision falling within the  range
    of decisions properly open to him on the available evidence. The  judge
    came to a different view of the evidence but there  was  no  lawful  or
    rational basis on which he could find that the decision was  in  breach
    of the appellant's human rights.

13. In Patel and Others v Secretary of State [2013] UKSC 72, Lord Carnworth
    in the context of an appeal by a student  against  refusal  of  further
    leave to remain said that it was important to remember that  article  8
    was not a general dispensing power [57]. To all  intents  and  purposes
    the judge was seeking to use article 6  to  suspend  or  dispense  with
    statutory provisions. In primary legislation Parliament has set out the
    grounds of appeal available to an appellant in a visit  appeal  and  it
    was not open to the judge to use human rights grounds as a cloak for  a
    merits appeal.

14. For these reasons we are satisfied that the judge erred in law in a way
    material to the outcome of the appeal. We set aside his  decision.  For
    the reasons we have already given, the appellant is not  able  to  show
    that the respondent's decision was unlawful  under  s.6  of  the  Human
    Rights Act 1998 and the appeal should have been dismissed.





Decision

15. The appeal by the respondent is allowed. The decision of the AIT is set
    aside and replaced by a decision dismissing the appeal by the appellant
    against the refusal of entry clearance as a visitor.
