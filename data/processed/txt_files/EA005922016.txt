Representation:

For the Appellant:          Mr A Pipe (Counsel, instructed by BHB Law)
For the Respondent:      Mr D Mills (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The Appellant, a national of Gambia, had applied for a residence card as
   the spouse of an EEA national in the UK exercising treaty rights, her
   children were also applicants. The applications were refused on the 6th
   of December 2015 and the Appellants appealed. The Grounds of Appeal
   asserted that the marriage was valid and genuine and that that the
   decision was flawed. The appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge
   Bart-Stewart in Birmingham on the 24th of March 2017.

2. The appeals were allowed by Judge Bart-Stewart in a decision promulgated
   on the 4th of April 2017. The decision in the appeals of the children are
   not in issue and do not form part of the proceedings before the Upper
   Tribunal. So far as the Appellant was concerned the Sponsor had
   previously supported a previous application by someone else on the basis
   of their being married, a marriage certificate had been provided and
   there was no evidence of divorce. The Judge found that the Appellant was
   an extended family member (EFM) but allowed the appeal on the basis that
   the Appellant was a family member having been previously granted a
   residence permit on that basis.

3. At the time of the hearing the case of Sala (EFMs: right of appeal)
   [2016] UKUT 411 (IAC) was the case that governed rights of appeal for
   EFMs under the EEA Regulations 2006. In paragraph 19 of the decision
   Judge Bart-Stewart distinguished the circumstances of this appeal from
   those in Sala. The Judge allowed the appeal on the basis that the
   Appellant was a family as that was the basis on which she had been
   granted entry to the UK in that capacity.

4. The grounds of application submitted by the Secretary of State
   maintained that there had been no application on the basis of a durable
   relationship under regulation 8 of the EEA Regulations 2006. Even if
   there had been such an application there would have been no right of
   appeal following Sala. The family permit that had been issued to the
   Appellant had been obtained on false pretences as it was now clear that
   the Appellant and Sponsor were not married and the declaration that they
   were was wrong.


5. The Appellant's application was as a family member which conferred a
   right of appeal, she had not applied as an EFM. I would have found that
   the Appellant did have a right of appeal on the basis of the application
   that had been made. It would have failed on that basis and the Judge did
   not on the basis of the law as then understood have the power to consider
   the alternative bais following the decision in Sala. However the point
   about Sala is now entirely academic as the case of Khan [2016] EWCA Civ
   1755 has overturned the Upper Tribunal decision and found that in EFM
   cases there is a right of appeal.


6. At the hearing the representatives indicated that they were agreed on
   the way forward for the appeal. As the Appellant could only be found to
   be an EFM, given the date of the divorce, it was not open to the Judge to
   allow the appeal on the basis that the Appellant was a family member. The
   findings at paragraph 18, that the Appellant and Sponsor are in a durable
   relationship, are not challenged by the Respondent.


7. I was invited to find that the decision of Judge Bart-Stewart contains
   an error of law to the extent that the Appellant is a family member and
   that the appeal was allowed under regulation 7, to set the decision
   aside. I was invited to remake the decision on the basis of the findings
   in paragraph 18 and allow the appeal under regulation 8 as an EFM for the
   Secretary of State to exercise her discretion under regulation 17(4) with
   regard to the issuing of a residence card.


8. Having regard to how this case has proceeded and with regard to the way
   that the law and appeal rights have changed I agree that the approach
   proposed is the appropriate way for this appeal to be disposed of. The
   effect is that the appeal is now allowed to the limited extent that the
   Appellant is found to be an EFM and it is for the Secretary of State to
   make a decision on the exercise of discretion under regulation 17(4) of
   the EEA Regulations 2006.

CONCLUSIONS

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making
of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

I re-make the decision in the appeal allowing the appeal of Mariama Marong
to the extent that I find that she is an extended family member within the
meaning of the regulation 8 of the EEA Regulations 2006. It is for the
Secretary of State to make a decision on the exercise of discretion under
regulation 17(4) of the EEA Regulations 2006.


Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and I make no
order.


Fee Award

In the light of the decision to re-make the decision in the appeal by
allowing it, I have considered whether to make a fee award (rule 23A
(costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and
section 12(4)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance Note: Fee Awards in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

The First-tier Tribunal's fee award of ï¿½140 stands.

Reasons: The Appellant's original application was on an erroneous basis but
the appeal has been allowed on the basis of facts found by the First-tier
Tribunal Judge.

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal (IAC)
