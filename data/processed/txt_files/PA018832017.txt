Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A. Adophy, Solicitor-Advocate of Rana & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Singh, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on 10 October 1988.
     He appeals against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Hodgkinson promulgated on 23  March  2017  in  which  he  rejected  the
    appellant's appeal against the earlier decision  of  the  Secretary  of
    State to refuse his protection and human rights claims.   The  relevant
    decision made by the respondent was made on 9 February 2017.

 2. It is perhaps worthwhile at this stage pointing out the nature  of  the
    decision making conducted  by  the  respondent.   In  paragraph  3  the
    decision maker set out the basis of the appellant's  protection  claim.
    He said that in 2006 the  appellant  formed  a  Shia  group  whilst  in
    college.  This caused friction between some of the other students.   He
    left and joined another Shiite group later in 2006 and participated  by
    collecting funds.  Later on, in 2011, he re-opened a Shia mosque  which
    had been closed down earlier and he described an event which took place
    on 13 June in which he was returning from  Lahore  and  was  in  a  car
    outside his home when shots were fired in the air before the  attackers
    left the scene.  The appellant was not injured and  did  not  recognise
    his attackers.  He reported the incident to the police and  the  police
    registered an FIR.

 3. Subsequently, on 6 March 2012,  the  appellant  referred  to  a  second
    incident where he was  approached  by  five  men  on  motorcycles.   He
    managed to escape from those men, even though they had been  armed  and
    began firing at the appellant.  He then moved to Lahore and after about
    six weeks he decided that he should leave Pakistan.

 4. The Secretary of State did not accept  that  claim,  and  part  of  the
    reasoning in the decision letter is a consideration of  the  background
    material which referred to the fact that 95% of  Pakistan's  population
    were Muslim.  The Shia Muslim population is in the minority, between  5
    and 20%.  There is no doubt that the appellant was part of  a  minority
    Shia Muslim community.  The background information supported the  claim
    that the Shia population is spread throughout Pakistan.  There  are  no
    provinces where the Shias constitute a majority, but that  the  overall
    background information does not suggest that Shias as a community  are,
    as a whole, at risk.  So, in  paragraph  23,  the  Secretary  of  State
    reasoned that whilst in general the Shias  are  a  minority  group,  it
    cannot be said that simply being a Shia would entitle the appellant  to
    international protection.  It was  against  this  background  that  the
    Secretary of State came to consider the claim.

 5. In support of her approach, and it became a central feature of the case
    this morning, the Secretary of State  relied  upon  answers  that  were
    given in interview by the appellant.  The appellant was asked about the
    incident which took place in June of 2011 and was asked about what  the
    police did when they arrived at the scene of the crime.  He  was  asked
    at question 55 what did the police do and he answered,

         "They took down the FIR."

     The appellant pointed to document number 6.  We know  from  C7  of  the
    bundle that document number 6 was an  English  translation  of  an  FIR
    which is dated June 2011.  Similarly, when he was asked about the later
    incident, he repeated his claim that the FIR was filed at the moment of
    the incident, so in answer to question 81 his last response was,

         "The police filed the FIR  and  then  the  police  left.   This  is
    document number 7".

     So, on both of those occasions the appellant  said  that  the  FIR  was
    created  at  the  scene  of  the  crime  when  the  police  arrived  to
    investigate the crime.  It was not created, according  to  the  answers
    given in response to questions 55 and 81 at the police station.

 6. The Secretary of State made the point in paragraph 33 and paragraph  34
    of the decision letter:

         "33. You have submitted English translations for the FIRs.   It  is
             noted that you claim that you were attacked on 13/06/2011  and
             the police arrived at the scene within 5 minutes and took down
             an FIR.  However, it is noted that the  FIR  states  that  the
             date of  report  being  15/06/2011,  some  2  days  after  the
             incident.  This inconsistency has been noted.

         34.  It is further noted that whilst you indicate that  the  second
             attack which took place on 06/03/2012, you state  an  FIR  was
             filed at the scene on the day of the  attack  and  the  police
             left.  Again, this is considered  inconsistent  with  the  FIR
             which states that the report date was 10/03/2012."

 7.  Accordingly,  what  the  refusal  letter  was  saying  was  that   the
    appellant's answers given in response  to  questions  55  and  81  were
    wrong.  They were simply  incorrect  or  untrue.   On  that  basis  the
    Secretary of State relied upon those answers as being inconsistent with
    the true facts.  In the determination the judge deals with  this  point
    and refers to the appellant's responses in interview between paragraphs
    24 and 29.  In paragraph 24 he merely recites what is said in paragraph
    33 of the refusal letter, and in particular repeats the evidence in the
    interview that the appellant said the first  FIR  was  created  at  the
    scene of the incident.  At paragraph 25 the judge refers to the refusal
    letter again, at paragraph 34, where once again  the  appellant  stated
    that the second FIR was produced at the incident.  We know that to have
    been wrong.  All that the judge is doing in paragraphs  24  and  25  is
    reciting something that is factually accurate.

 8. At paragraph 27  the  judge  refers  to  the  appellant's  evidence  in
    relation to this and quotes paragraph 11 of his statement in which  the
    appellant said:-

         "The Respondent erred  in  her  findings  that  the  dates  of  the
         incidents are different to the  date  the  FIRs  were  filed.   The
         Respondent is mistaken about the report made when the police  first
         attend the scene to the one that is officially filed at the  police
         station.  On both occasions when the police attended the scene they
         took first response report which is a note  that  an  incident  has
         happened.  Then FIR is a report that  is  made  in  person  at  the
         station,  a  formal  complaint  and  request  to  the   police   to
         specifically investigate the crime committed against me."

 9. I entirely accept that that is what occurs in such cases.   Inevitably,
    the policeman involved at the scene of the crime will use his  notebook
    to record whatever he sees and hears when questioning the  persons  who
    are potential witnesses, but that is not what the appellant said.   His
    answers to questions 55 and 81 are clear.  He was saying  the  FIR  was
    created at the scene of the incident.  That is precisely what the judge
    records in paragraph  28  of  the  determination  by  saying  that  the
    appellant's evidence did not accord with what we know to  be  the  true
    position.  He referred to the answers  that  he  gave  as  to  the  two
    incidents.  He recites the answer to question  55  that  the  appellant
    provided.  He recites also in paragraph 28 the question and the  answer
    that was provided by the appellant in relation to the  March  incident.
    Accordingly, paragraph 28 is factually correct.  He does no  more  than
    recite the material.

10. When it therefore comes to paragraph 29 he makes the point:-

         "Thus, the appellant's indication, in his asylum interview, is that
         the FIRs were taken by the  police  on  the  actual  dates  of  the
         alleged two incidents, and not thereafter.  I find his  attempt  to
         explain this date discrepancy to be unsatisfactory and  to  be  one
         which lacks credibility.  I  find  that  the  date  discrepancy  is
         damaging to the reliability of the  FIRs  and  to  the  appellant's
         credibility as a whole."

11. The explanation provided by  the  appellant  in  paragraph  11  of  his
    statement is not that the respondent made a mistake  in  recording  his
    answers.  He said they were made at the time of the incident.  He  made
    no reference to a notebook entry followed by a  subsequent  arrival  at
    the police station.  Thus, paragraph 29 of the  determination  is  also
    factually correct.

12. It would have been open to the appellant to say:-

         "I'm sorry, I got  that  all  confused.   When  I  referred  in  my
         interviews to the FIRs as I did by reference to document  number  6
         and document number 7, I wasn't in fact referring to FIRs  at  all.
         I was referring to the notebook entries  which  were  made  at  the
         scene and the FIRs were made later"

    If that had been provided as an explanation, it would have required the
    judge to consider whether his explanation was a truthful one  but  that
    was not what the evidence was. Consequently, I find  it  impossible  to
    say that paragraphs 24 to 29 in the passages to which I  have  referred
    contain any errors of law.  They are all factually accurate and it  was
    open to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  to  find  that  this  was  a
    credibility issue.

13. There is, however, a more telling point as to the reliability that  can
    be placed upon the FIRs.  They are to be found at  D6  and  D7  of  the
    respondent's bundle.  In one version of the documents  they  are  found
    side-by-side; in other words, one is able to make a  direct  comparison
    between the  two  documents  by  looking  at  them  side-by-side.   The
    striking feature is that both of these incidents,  which  are  entirely
    separate incidents and which did not take place at the same  spot,  are
    each described in paragraph 4 of the FIR in these terms:-

         "Place of occurrence and direction from Police Station

         In the vicinity of Mohallah Sutanpura distance 1 � K.M Towards East
         from Police Station"

     Exactly the same description is provided in paragraph 4 of  the  second
    FIR which, on its face, was created on 10 March 2012 referring  to  the
    incident on 6 March 2012.

14. It was open to the judge to find that it was simply wrong to  say  that
    the two incidents took place at exactly the same spot.  It is  said  on
    behalf  of  the  appellant  by  Mr  Adophy  that  this  is   merely   a
    jurisdictional reference and that it does not refer  to  the  place  of
    occurrence itself; it refers to the area in which  the  police  station
    has jurisdiction over.  There is no evidence to that  effect.   But  in
    any event I reject it because that is simply not what  is  being  said.
    The place of occurrence and direction from the police station  is  what
    is described; not the jurisdiction of the relevant police station.   In
    each case it is said  that  it  took  place  one-and-a-half  kilometres
    towards east from the police station and, therefore, in the same  area.



15. There is, in my view, another matter which indicates  that  these  FIRs
    are falsified.   If  one  looks  at  the  typesetting  side-by-side  of
    paragraph 4 which describes the place where the incident occurred,  the
    words 'In the vicinity'  are  inset  and  are  somewhat  further  inset
    compared with the second line which says "1 �  K.M  Towards  East  from
    Police Station".  If one then looks at the description of what happened
    at the place of occurrence in the second of the FIRs,  once  again  the
    first line is inset slightly towards the right of the line that follows
    where the distance is described as "1 � K.M".  Exactly the same  occurs
    in both documents.  There is a full stop after the "K"  but  not  after
    the "M".  "Towards East" are both typed with uppercase letters.

16. I am satisfied that both of those entries are not simply the same words
    but exactly the same typesetting.  This looks to  me  like  a  cut  and
    paste job.  These were matters which the judge  was  entitled  to  take
    into account and did so at paragraph 26 of the determination by relying
    on the very point made to that effect at paragraph 35  of  the  refusal
    letter and concluding,  in  paragraph  30,  that  these  documents  are
    unreliable.

17. Not only do I determine that that was a finding that was properly  open
    to the judge, but I too consider to the extent that I am sure,  looking
    at these documents, that their internal evidence is such that they  are
    falsities.  No adequate explanation was provided by the  appellant  for
    these striking coincidences in the FIRs.  Accordingly whatever  may  be
    said about the appellant's claim that the FIRs were made at  the  place
    of the incident, the assessment by the judge as to  the  similarity  in
    the description of the two separate incidents in the two separate First
    Information Reports is such as to render them unreliable.

18. On the basis of those sustainable findings it was therefore open to the
    judge to assess the  affidavits  in  the  sense  that  the  substantive
    content of all three affidavits was largely  identical,  and  that  the
    contents  did  not  address  the  core  of   the   appellant's   claim.
    Accordingly, it was open to the judge  to  place  limited  weight  upon
    those.

19. Similarly, having made sustainable findings in relation to the FIRs and
    the appellant's evidence as to how they came about, it was open to  the
    judge  to discount the reliability of the evidence in relation  to  the
    newspaper reports which were dealt with by the judge in paragraph 35 of
    the determination.

20. In these circumstances I am satisfied that the judge  made  sustainable
    findings.  It is also the case that the judge  took  into  account  the
    background information about Shia Muslims in Pakistan as assisting  him
    in reaching his conclusion.  In the totality, he went  on  to  consider
    that the appellant's account of the adverse events  which  occurred  to
    him in Pakistan was fabricated and accordingly he was not  entitled  to
    his protection claim.  I do not find there was an error of law  in  the
    judge's determination and the conclusions that he reached were properly
    open to him.

DECISION


        The Judge made no  error  on  a  point  of  law  and  the  original
        determination of the appeal shall stand.
