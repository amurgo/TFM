Representation:

For the Appellant:  Mr Tufan Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.

For the Respondent: No appearance.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal  against  a  determination  of  First-tier  Judge
        Conrath who, on the 11th April  2013,  allowed  Mr  Rifat's  appeal
        against the refusal to grant him further leave to remain as a  Tier
        1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant dated 27th September 2012.


     2.  The  key  issue  in  the  appeal  was  whether  Mr  Rifat's   ACCA
        qualification met the requirements of the Rules, so  as  to  enable
        him to claim the requisite points under  Appendix  A  (Attributes).
        Judge Conrath found it was.


     3. The Secretary of State appealed alleging a misdirection in  law  as
        the ACCA qualification did not satisfy  the  specific  requirements
        set out in Appendix A, para 68, Table 10(a) of the Rules.



Discussion



     4. Neither Mr Rifat  nor  his  representative  attended  although  the
        Tribunal did receive a letter dated 17th June 2013 asking  for  the
        appeal to be determined on the papers and recognising  the  reality
        of Mr Rifat's position in light  of  the  developing  case  law  in
        relation to this issue.


     5. In Mirza (ACCA Fundamental  level  qualification-not  a  recognised
        degree) [2013] UKUT 00041 the Tribunal found that as the ACCA  does
        not have degree awarding powers the qualifications which it  awards
        are not UK recognised degrees. In the case of  Syed  and  Kamran  v
        Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 985  (Admin)
        the High Court confirmed this decision.


     6. We find Judge Conrath materially erred in law by finding  that  the
        ACCA qualification met the requirements of the Rules  when  clearly
        it did not on the law in force at the date of the hearing as stated
        in the later decision of Mirza. It is accepted that in light of the
        case law Mr Rifat cannot succeed  with  his  appeal.  We  therefore
        substitute our decision dismissing the appeal.
Decision

     7. The Immigration Judge materially erred in law.  We  set  aside  the
        decision of the original Immigration Judge. We remake the  decision
        as follows. This appeal is dismissed.
