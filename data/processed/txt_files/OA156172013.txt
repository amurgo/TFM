                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. Although the Entry Clearance Officer is the Appellant before me I will,
    for ease of reference, refer to him as the Respondent  as  he  was  the
    Respondent before the First-tier Tribunal at the hearing on 5 September
    2014. Similarly I will refer to Mrs Ameen as the Appellant as  she  was
    the Appellant before the First-tier Judge.

 2. The Respondent was granted permission to appeal against the decision of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Hawden-Beal (the Judge),  who  dismissed  the
    Appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules, because  the  Appellant
    could not meet the evidential provisions of Appendix FM-SE in  relation
    to the income of the Sponsor, and allowed it under Article 8 ECHR.  She
    found that (i) it was accepted by the  Respondent  that  the  specified
    evidence provided by the Appellant in relation to the  Sponsor's income
    was 13 days short of the six month period during which he had  to  show
    that he earned  �18,600  in  the  twelve  months  before  the  date  of
    application; (ii) that he met all  the  other  requirements  for  entry
    clearance and it was therefore a disproportionate interference with the
    Sponsor's life and breached his right to a family life with  his  wife;
    and (iii) that the Sponsor could not return to Kirkuk to  enjoy  family
    life with he Appellant due to the security situation and level of  risk
    to British citizens [19].

 3. In  the  grounds  of  application,  it  is  submitted  that  the  Judge
    materially misdirected herself in law because:

        a. As stated in the grounds at paras 1 - 7, 9 - 11 and 13,  Gulshan
           [2013] UKUT  00640  (IAC)  make  is  clear  that  an  Article  8
           assessment  should  only  be  carried   out   where   compelling
           circumstances not  covered  by  the  Rules  are  established.  R
           (Nagre)  SSHD  [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin)  provided  that   such
           compelling  circumstances  would  only  be  established  if  the
           refusal would lead to an unjustifiably harsh outcome. The  Judge
           had  not  established  such  compelling  circumstances,  thereby
           failing to apply the correct test, and  had  failed  to  provide
           reasons as to why  it  would  be  unjustifiably  harsh  for  the
           Appellant and the Sponsor to continue family life in Kirkuk; the
           Appellant's  security  fears  were   generalizations   and   the
           Appellant and the Sponsor had failed to show that either of them
           would be at risk directly or that they would  be  of  particular
           interest. It is  submitted  that  the  income  requirements  are
           within the Immigration Rules and there was no prejudice  to  the
           Appellant in the application of the law. The Appellant chose  to
           submit her application when there was no realistic  prospect  of
           success under the Immigration Rules,  rather  than  delaying  it
           until such time as there was sufficient evidence, and the  Judge
           failed to make findings on whether the Appellant could have made
           a further application. There was no analysis by the Judge of why
           the Appellant could not submit a further application.

        b.  The  Judge  used  the   "...proximity   of   success   of   the
           application/near miss as  a basis for allowing under  Article  8
           ECHR", when Article 8 should  not  be  used  to  circumvent  the
           Rules; there were no  exceptional  circumstances  to  warrant  a
           grant of  leave  outside  the  Immigration  Rules.  The  Judge's
           finding amounted to a reliance on the near miss argument  and  a
           finding that the Immigration Rules will never  be  proportionate
           in a case involving a British national.

 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge Levin granted permission on  the  basis  that
    "The failure on the part of the Judge to follow  the  Upper  Tribunal's
    guidance in Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules -  correct  approach)  [201]
    UKUT 640 (IAC) and in effect to allow the Appeal on human rights ground
    as a "near miss" arguably amounts to a material error of law".

The Hearing

 5. I heard submissions from the Mr Mills and Mr Ali, which are recorded in
    the record of proceedings and I will refer to them where  necessary  in
    my findings of fact. On finding that the Judge had materially erred  in
    law, I also heard oral evidence from the Sponsor which again is set out
    in the record of proceedings. I will refer to these where necessary  in
    my decision and reasons.

Decision and reasons

 6. Mr Mills essentially relied on the grounds of  application,  submitting
    that although the case law had moved on from Gulshan and  Nagre,  still
    it had been confirmed in SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 at paragraph 17
    that  compelling  circumstances  needed  to  be  established   if   the
    Immigration Rules were not met. SS (Congo) at para 40 provides:

         "... we consider that the state has a wider margin of  appreciation
         in determining  the  conditions  to  be  satisfied  before  LTE  is
         granted, by contrast with the position  in  relation  to  decisions
         regarding LTR for  persons  with  a  (non-precarious)  family  life
         already established in the United Kingdom. The Secretary  of  State
         has already, in effect, made some  use  of  this  wider  margin  of
         appreciation by excluding section EX.1 as a basis for grant of LTE,
         although it is available as a basis for grant of LTR. The LTE Rules
         therefore maintain, in general  terms,  a  reasonable  relationship
         with the requirements of Article 8 in the ordinary  run  of  cases.
         However, it remains possible to imagine cases where the  individual
         interests at stake are of a particularly pressing nature so that  a
         good claim for LTE can be established outside  the  Rules.  In  our
         view, the appropriate general formulation for this category is that
         such cases will arise where an applicant  for  LTE  can  show  that
         compelling  circumstances  exist  (which   are   not   sufficiently
         recognised under the new  Rules)  to  require  the  grant  of  such
         leave."

 7. Mr Mills further submitted that the Judge at [19] allowed the appeal on
    a straight 'near miss' basis because the Appellant  had  only  been  in
    employment for 5 � months prior to the  date  of  application.  However
    allowing an appeal on human  rights  grounds  where  an  appellant  had
    narrowly missed meeting the Immigration Rules had been rejected in Miah
    v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 261 and to some extent in Patel  v  SSHD  [2013]
    UKSC 72 by the Supreme Court. He relied on paras 54 - 57 of SS  (Congo)
    which provide:

         "54. At the hearing, there was debate about the proper approach  to
         be adopted in 'near miss' cases, for example if the sponsor  of  an
         applicant for LTE could provide evidence  of  an  annual  income  a
         little less than the �18,600 required  or  could  provide  evidence
         which might be regarded as similar to (but not the  same  as)  that
         required under Appendix FM-SE.  Mr  Payne,  for  the  Secretary  of
         State, made submissions to the effect that 'a miss is as good as  a
         mile' and that the fact that one is dealing with a 'near miss' case
         should be irrelevant to the Article 8 balancing exercise  required.
         The general position of the respondents, on  the  other  hand,  was
         that great weight should be attached to the fact that there  was  a
         'near miss' by an applicant in relation to the requirements of  the
         Rules.

         "55.  In  our  judgment,  the  true  position  lies  between  these
         submissions. Contrary to the argument of the respondents, that fact
         that an applicant may be able to say that their  case  is  a  'near
         miss' in relation to satisfying the requirements of the Rules  will
         by no means show that compelling circumstances exist requiring  the
         grant of LTE outside the Rules. A good deal more  than  this  would
         need to be shown to make out such a case. The respondents' argument
         fails to recognise the value to  be  attached  to  having  a  clear
         statement of the standards applicable to everyone and fails to give
         proper weight to  the  judgment  of  the  Secretary  of  State,  as
         expressed in the Rules, regarding what is needed to meet the public
         interest which is  in  issue.  The  'near  miss'  argument  of  the
         respondents  cannot  be   sustained   in   the   light   of   these
         considerations and the authority of Miah v Secretary of  State  for
         the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 261, especially at [21]-[26].

         "56. However, it cannot be said that the fact that a case  involves
         a 'near miss' in relation to the requirements set out in the  Rules
         is wholly irrelevant  to  the  balancing  exercise  required  under
         Article 8. If an applicant  can  show  that  there  are  individual
         interests at stake covered by Article 8 which give rise to a strong
         claim that compelling circumstances may exist to justify the  grant
         of LTE outside the Rules, the fact that their case is also a  'near
         miss' case may be a relevant consideration which tips  the  balance
         under Article 8 in their favour. In such a case, the applicant will
         be able to say that the detrimental impact on the  public  interest
         in issue if LTE is granted in their favour will  be  somewhat  less
         than in a case where the gap between the applicant's  position  and
         the requirements of the Rules is great, and the risk that they  may
         end up having recourse to public funds and resources  is  therefore
         greater.

         "57. In certain of the appeals before us, the respondents said that
         improvements in the position of their sponsors were on the horizon,
         so that there appeared to be a reasonable prospect  that  within  a
         period of weeks or months they would in fact be able to satisfy the
         requirements of the Rules. They maintained that  the  Secretary  of
         State should have taken this into account when deciding whether  to
         grant LTE outside the Rules. In our judgment, however, this affords
         very weak support for a claim for grant of LTE outside  the  Rules.
         The Secretary of State remains entitled to enforce the Rules in the
         usual way, to say that the Rules have not been satisfied  and  that
         the applicant should apply again when the circumstances have indeed
         changed. This reflects a fair balance between the interests of  the
         individual and the public interest. The Secretary of State  is  not
         required to take a speculative risk as to whether the  requirements
         in the Rules will in fact be satisfied in the future when  deciding
         what to do. Generally, it is fair that the  applicant  should  wait
         until the circumstances have changed and the  requirements  in  the
         Rules are satisfied and then apply, rather than attempting to  jump
         the queue by asking for preferential treatment outside the Rules in
         advance."

 8. He submitted that although the  Court  of  Appeal  in  SS  (Congo)  had
    watered down the application of Miah, it had been expressly approved by
    the Court who maintained that  missing  the  requirements  by  a  small
    margin  was  not  irrelevant  but  that  compelling  circumstances  for
    allowing an appeal outside the Rules had to be established.

 9. Mr Mills submitted that the only other issue relied on by the Judge was
    the inability of the Sponsor to relocate to  Kirkuk  and  the  security
    situation there. However, the Appellant was not a refugee  and  he  had
    resided in Kirkuk for a year with his wife after  marriage.  The  Judge
    heard the appeal in September 2014; ISIS had stepped up their offensive
    in June of 2014 but the Judge had over-reacted to  the  threat;  Kirkuk
    was  in  the  control  of  the  Kurdish  Authorities  and  the  Kurdish
    Government Area was safe and was in fact the place where others went to
    find safety from ISIS. This is the area where failed asylum seekers are
    still returned and that remains the policy position. Both the Appellant
    and the Sponsor are Kurdish and there is no reason why they cannot live
    there.

10. Finally, Mr Mills submitted  that  the  Judge  completely  ignored  the
    ability of the Appellant to re-apply; having failed to delay submitting
    the application under appeal for two weeks, it was not unreasonable for
    them to re-apply and this was expressly approved in SS (Congo) at  para
    57. He submitted that the Judge's decision was unsafe and must  be  set
    aside.

11. Mr Ali submitted that Gulshan had been drawn to the  attention  of  the
    Judge; she had been provided with a copy and  it  was  referred  to  in
    submissions and in the skeleton argument before  her.  He  argued  that
    decisions such as Gulshan were  not  a  'trump  card'  and  should  not
    qualify or fetter an Article 8 assessment and failure to mention it did
    not mean that the Judge erred in  law.  Furthermore,  Gulshan  required
    some form of exceptionality to be established and all that needed to be
    established were 'compelling circumstances' as provided by  SS  (Congo)
    at paras 40 and 41.

12. As to the compelling circumstances, Mr Ali  submitted  that  the  Judge
    focused on: (i) the narrow margin by which the Appellant failed to meet
    the  financial  requirements;  she  met  all  the  other   requirements
    including the English  language  test;  (ii)  the  strong  relationship
    between the Appellant and Sponsor; she did  not  reject  the  Sponsor's
    evidence at [10]; (iii) the Sponsor is a British national, he has lived
    here for 13 years and has been a British citizen since  2008;  he  gave
    reasons as to why he could not live in Iraq which the  Judge  accepted;
    (iv) there was pressure from the family which is  why  the  application
    was made earlier; they were blaming him for the  delay  in  making  the
    application and if he had had to  make  a  further  application,  there
    would have been further delays. He submitted that the Judge  was  aware
    that the policy reason for the financial requirements was so that those
    who came to the UK could be maintained at a reasonable  level  and  not
    become a burden on the state [19] and acknowledged the public  interest
    considerations. She was entitled to conclude that it was  a  compelling
    case and there was no prejudice to the Respondent who accepted that  he
    was earning sufficient  income;  she  found  that  there  would  be  no
    recourse  to  public  funds  and  that  the  facts  were   sufficiently
    compelling.

13. Regarding how long the application had taken to process from  the  date
    it was submitted, it appeared from the documentary  evidence  that  the
    form was submitted online on 2 April 2103 but that the  paper  copy  of
    this was signed on 22 April 2013. Mr Mills confirmed that  it  was  not
    unusual for this to occur where an applicant  had  gone  in  to  submit
    documentary evidence. As the date of decision is 18 June 2013, it  took
    less than 2  months  for  the  application  to  be  processed.  Mr  Ali
    submitted that even if a further application had been  submitted,  they
    could not rely on the ECO granting an entry clearance visa.

14. In reply, Mr Mills submitted that in allowing the appeal, the Judge had
    in mind the delay which occurred to the date of  hearing;  this  was  a
    further error on her part because in an entry clearance case, even  for
    the purposes of the Article 8 assessment, she  was  bound  to  consider
    circumstances as they were at the  date  of  decision  pursuant  to  AS
    (Somalia) [2009] UKHL 32; she did not consider the availability of  the
    option to re-apply and SS (Congo) now provides that such a  requirement
    is fair and proportionate. The mistake which led to the refusal  was  a
    mistake on the part of the Appellant; it was not  the  mistake  of  the
    ECO.

15. At the end of the hearing I stated that I  found  that  the  Judge  had
    materially erred in law and that her decision must  be  set  aside.  My
    reasons for so doing are:

16. I accept as submitted by Mr Mills that whilst a near miss  argument  is
    capable  of  strengthening  a  claim,  compelling   reasons   must   be
    established for a grant of leave outside the  Immigration  Rules.  This
    was not particularly in dispute, Mr Ali's main  submission  being  that
    the Judge had in fact established compelling circumstances.

17. Whilst the Judge gave some reasons for applying  Article  8,  she  gave
    insufficient  reasons for (i) her finding that the  security  situation
    in Kirkuk rendered it unsafe for the Appellant and  Sponsor  to  reside
    together there (bearing in  mind  that  that  there  was  no  objective
    evidence regarding the ISIS offensive having spread to  Kirkuk  at  the
    date of decision). It would appear that the Judge  had  in  fact  taken
    into account circumstances at the  date  of  hearing  in  reaching  her
    decision, contrary to AS (Somalia); and (ii) why it was unsafe for  the
    Sponsor to reside in Kirkuk, bearing in mind that he had  resided  with
    the Appellant in Kirkuk from the time they were married on 28 September
    2011 to the time he left on 23 August 2012. Furthermore, the Judge  did
    not take into account that if the Appellant was  able  to  provide  the
    specified evidence by the date of decision (and he could have if it was
    accepted that he had not in fact been employed for a period of 6 months
    by the date of application and had been by the date  of  decision),  it
    was open to her to make a further application. These considerations are
    capable of making a material difference to the outcome of the appeal.

Remaking the decision

18. The Sponsor then gave further evidence in support of the appeal  and  I
    heard submissions from  Mr  Mills  and  Mr  Ali.  The  additional  oral
    evidence and submissions are set out in the record of proceedings.

19. Mr Mills submitted that the Immigration Rules could not  be  met,  that
    there was no room for discretion and although the Sponsor  had  pleaded
    that the delay had caused problems with his in-laws,  they  could  have
    made a further application at  any  point.  Furthermore,  although  the
    Sponsor stated that he did not know that he would not be able  to  meet
    the Immigration Rules, he had legal advice throughout the hearing;  all
    they  had  to  do  was  submit  an  application  and   that   was   not
    disproportionate.

20. Mr Ali submitted that he relied on the submissions made in relation  to
    the the error of law part of the hearing and from a lay person's  point
    of view, they had only missed the requirements by 13  days;  it  was  a
    near miss but there were  compelling  circumstances  also.  If  another
    application was made there would be serious  adverse  consequences  for
    the relationship and there was  considerable  family  pressure  on  the
    Sponsor, who was afraid that if he made another application,  it  would
    lead to the breakdown of the  marriage.  This  was  a  highly  relevant
    consideration and there was no guarantee that  if  the  Appellant  made
    another application she would succeed. He stated that  there  was  room
    for these matters and there was no prejudice to the Respondent.

21. I find that the policy requirement for evidence of income for a  period
    of 12 months where an Appellant has not been in the same employment for
    a period of 6 months prior to the date of application is underpinned by
    the need to ensure as far as possible that there will be no recourse or
    no additional  recourse  to  public  funds  by  ensuring  stability  of
    employment. Where the Appellant could not meet the requirements at  the
    date of application but can do so subsequently, the correct  course  of
    action is to make a further application (SS (Congo)).

22. When asked why the Appellant had not simply made a further application,
    the Sponsor stated that (i) he had been  told  that  his  evidence  was
    'short'; if it was short, then it  was  necessary  to  correct  it  and
    provide the necessary evidence; (ii) the Appellant  had  been  given  a
    right of appeal; if it was not going to succeed, then  the  ECO  should
    have simply told them to make a fresh application; (iii) there had been
    a lot of delay since they appealed; he did not think that he would, two
    years later, still be waiting for his wife to join him; and (iv)  there
    was a lot of pressure from his in-laws to get the visa; his  mother-in-
    law had said that she would take her daughter back and they would get a
    divorce and that if he had  said  that  they  needed  to  make  another
    application, they would think that he was lying. There were many people
    in this situation where they had married a British citizen and not been
    able to get a visa and it is now difficult for a British citizen to get
    a wife.

23. When asked when the question of divorce arose, the Sponsor said that it
    was because it had taken nearly three years to get his wife here  (they
    were married in 2011) and he had had to telephone the courts to  get  a
    date for the hearing. He stated that if he had known that it would take
    so long, he would not have appealed and that he could not live with his
    wife in Kirkuk because it was unsafe whatever you  might  hear  on  the
    BBC.

24. In assessing whether compelling circumstances have been established for
    a grant of leave outside the Rules, I cannot take into account  matters
    that have arisen since the date of decision. I cannot, therefore,  take
    into account the deterioration in the security situation  and,  in  any
    event, no background evidence was presented to  establish  that  Kirkuk
    was unsafe at the date of decision. It  is  clear  from  the  preserved
    findings of fact that there was no mention of divorce which led to  the
    making of the application earlier than it should  have  been  made;  at
    that stage, the Sponsor had simply stated that there was pressure  from
    his in-laws [16]. Pressure from in-laws is not a compelling reason  for
    failing to comply with Immigration Rules. He also stated at the hearing
    before the Tirst-tier Tribunal that if his appeal was refused he  would
    have no option but to re-apply for his wife to join him.  I  find  that
    the prolonged period of separation, and any problems that  have  arisen
    as  a  result  of  it,  are  due  not  to  the  system  for  processing
    applications but to the course of action that the Appellant has  chosen
    to take in not submitting a new application with the correct  evidence.
    Although both the Sponsor and Mr Ali stated that a new application  may
    have been refused for other reasons, there is no reason why a  properly
    prepared application accompanied by the specified evidence  should  not
    succeed and compelling circumstances have not been  established  for  a
    grant of leave outside the Rules.  Even if I were to find that  Article
    8 should be applied directly, taking into account the factors  set  out
    in Mr Ali's skeleton argument at para 10, in response to  step  two  of
    the Razgar [2004] UKHL 27  five  step  approach,  the  interference  by
    reason of refusal of the application does not result in consequences of
    such gravity as to potentially engage the operation of Article 8.  This
    is simply because all that the Appellant needed to do is make a further
    entry clearance  application,  particularly  when  there  has  been  no
    excessive delay in the processing of  the  application,  and  this  has
    always been open to them. Contrary to Mr  Ali's  submission,  there  is
    prejudice to the Respondent if an appeal  is  pursued  when  a  further
    application can be submitted; the Respondent has the task, and expense,
    of defending proceedings where the clear  and  reasonable  approach  is
    simply to submit a new application supported by the specified evidence.



Decision

25. There are material errors of law in the decision of  Judge  Hawden-Beal
    as set out above in relation to her consideration  of  Article  8.  Her
    decision is set aside on the basis of Article  8  only.  I  remake  the
    decision to dismiss the Appellant's appeal under Article 8.

26. The Respondent's appeal is allowed.

Anonymity

27. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)
    of the Asylum and immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and I see
    no reason why an order should be  made  pursuant  to  Rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

TO THE RESPONDENT

In light of my decision, I have considered  whether  to  make  a  fee  award
under Rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (procedure)
Rules 2005 and section 12(4) (a) of the  Tribunals  Courts  and  Enforcement
Act 2007.

As I have dismissed the Appellant's appeal, I make no fee order.
