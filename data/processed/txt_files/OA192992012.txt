Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr G Hodgetts, Counsel instructed by South West Law
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Archer in which he dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  a
    citizen of Somalia, against the  Respondent's  decision  to  refuse  to
    grant entry clearance as a partner. The Respondent's refusal  was  made
    by reference to paragraph EC-P.1.1 of Appendix FM  of  the  Immigration
    Rules (HC 395) (as amended)  on  6  September  2012.   The  Appellant's
    application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was  granted
    by First-tier Tribunal Judge Chohan on 10 October 2013. By  a  rule  24
    response dated 31  October  2013  the  Respondent  confirmed  that  the
    Appellant's appeal was opposed.

 2. At the hearing before us Mr Hodgetts appeared for the Appellant and the
    Sponsor, the  Sponsor's  daughter  and  other  relatives  all  of  whom
    identified  themselves  to  us,  were  present  in  Court.  An  indexed
    consolidated bundle was submitted on behalf of the Appellant.


Submissions

 3. For the Appellant Mr Hodgetts said that the First-tier Tribunal had not
    grappled with the correct legal framework. The Respondent was  referred
    to as the Secretary of State rather than the Entry  Clearance  Officer.
    The Judge refers to the application under  appeal  not  being  one  for
    entry clearance and to the relevant date  as  being  the  date  of  the
    appeal hearing. The in-country spouse rule is quoted and applied rather
    than the relevant entry clearance rule.

 4. So far as the substance of the appeal was concerned the only issue  for
    the First-tier Tribunal to decide was whether there would be additional
    recourse to public funds on the Appellant's  admission  to  the  United
    Kingdom yet the Judge failed to refer to or apply the test  in  KA  and
    Others (Adequacy of maintenance) Pakistan [2006] UKAIT  00065.  Figures
    had been submitted supported by evidence showing that at  the  time  of
    the Respondent's decision the Sponsor had a  total  income  of  �278.35
    made up of �200.90 in pension credit and �77.45  Attendance  Allowance.
    This exceeds the notional income support level  for  a  married  couple
    which would amount to �276.10 being �217.90 pension credit  and  �58.20
    severe disability addition. The Judge did not deal with these  figures:
    rather he says that because  the  Sponsor's  daughter  had  said  in  a
    previous appeal that the Sponsor would not claim public funds  and  the
    fact that she went  on  to  claim  caused  him  to  conclude  that  the
    Appellant may do the  same.  This  finding  is  inconsistent  with  the
    positive credibility finding made in respect of the Sponsor's  daughter
    and her evidence that she had never intended to apply for benefits  for
    the Sponsor and only did so six months after the Sponsor's arrival when
    advised that the Sponsor was not getting  the  benefits  that  she  was
    entitled to.

 5. For the Respondent Mr Richards relied on the rule 24 response and added
    that the Judge was entitled to look at the past conduct of the  Sponsor
    and her daughter.

Error of Law

 6. In our judgement it is clear that the First-tier Tribunal erred in  law
    in three particular ways. Firstly, although it  is  apparent  that  the
    Judge  was  at  all  time  aware  that  this  was  an  entry  clearance
    application and  the  reference  to  the  Secretary  of  State  as  the
    Respondent and to this not being an  application  for  entry  clearance
    (paragraph 9) appear to be 'cut and paste' errors rather than  ones  of
    substance, the reference to the E-ELTRP (leave to remain)  rather  than
    the E-ECP  (entry  clearance)  sections  of  the  Rules  together  with
    reference to the relevant date as being the date of hearing amount to a
    substantial misdirection. Secondly the failure to consider by reference
    to the submitted evidence whether, it being accepted that  the  Sponsor
    is in receipt of attendance allowance and  therefore  exempt  from  the
    requirements of paragraph E-ECP.3.1, the  Appellant  and  Sponsor  were
    able at the time of decision to  maintain  and  accommodate  themselves
    adequately without further recourse to public funds. Thirdly it was  in
    our judgement irrational for the Judge to hold  adversely  against  the
    Appellant's integrity the Sponsor's daughter's statement to a  previous
    Tribunal that she had no intention that the Sponsor would claim  public
    funds, particularly given that he regarded the Sponsor as  credible  in
    her evidence before him. These  errors  of  law  are  material  to  the
    decision to dismiss  the  appeal  and  accordingly  we  set  aside  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal.


Remaking the decision

 7. In remaking the decision our starting point is that the only matter  in
    issue is maintenance. The Appellant is a 78 year old citizen of Somalia
    who applied for entry clearance to join his wife (now aged 84)  in  the
    United Kingdom. The application was refused firstly because  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer was satisfied that a false statement had been made by
    the Appellant, secondly because the Entry  Clearance  Officer  did  not
    accept that the couple were related as claimed or  if  they  were  that
    their relationship was genuine and subsisting and thirdly  because  the
    Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that the Appellant  could  be
    adequately maintained  and  accommodated  without  recourse  to  public
    funds.  When  the  matter  came  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the
    Appellant had submitted DNA evidence to substantiate  his  relationship
    to the Sponsor  and  their  daughter,  written  and  oral  evidence  to
    substantiate the subsistence of the relationship and an explanation for
    the  statement  that  the  Respondent  considered  to  be  false.   The
    Presenting Officer at the First-tier Tribunal agreed that the only live
    issues were maintenance and accommodation and at the hearing before  us
    Mr Richards did not  demur  from  this.  So  far  as  accommodation  is
    concerned evidence was submitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  the
    Judge found that the proposed accommodation was adequate. This  is  not
    challenged before us.

 8. So far as maintenance is concerned the Notice of Refusal  accepts  that
    the sponsor is exempt from meeting the  requirements  of  paragraph  E-
    ECP.3.1 as she is in receipt of attendance allowance.  The  only  issue
    therefore is whether the Appellant can be maintained  and  accommodated
    without additional recourse  to  public  funds.  In  this  respect  the
    unchallenged evidence is that the Sponsor's income exceeds the notional
    income support level for a married couple.  The  figures  are  detailed
    above. The Sponsor  is  receiving  what  she  is  legally  entitled  to
    receive; there is no suggestion to the contrary. Following the dicta in
    KA and others it is our judgement that the Appellant can be  maintained
    and accommodated without additional  recourse  to  public  funds.  This
    appeal is therefore allowed.


CONCLUSION


 9. The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law. We set aside that decision.

10. The Appellant meets the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  We
    remake the decision and allow this appeal.
