                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. By a decision promulgated on 11th January  2019  I  set  aside  the
         First-tier Tribunal decision in the following terms:

          i. The appellant,  a  Peruvian  citizen,  applied  for  Permanent
             Residence on the grounds that he had  resided  in  the  UK  in
             accordance  with  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
             Regulations 2006 for a continuous period of five years and had
             retained a right of residence as the former spouse of  an  EEA
             national. That application was refused for reasons set out  in
             a decision dated 18th January 2017. His  appeal  against  that
             decision was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  J  Wyman
             for reasons set out in a decision promulgated  on  23rd  April
             2018.

         ii. He sought and was granted permission to appeal on the  grounds
             that:

               1. The First-tier Tribunal judge took the relevant  date  for
                  calculation as the date of divorce (15th October 2010)  as
                  opposed to the date of initiation of divorce proceedings -
                  see Baigazieva [2018] EWCA Civ 1088;

               2. That the judge referred to a lack  of  evidence  that  the
                  appellant and his wife had 'lived together' for  one  year
                  in the UK rather than the correct test which is that  they
                  have lived in the UK for one year exercising Treaty Rights
                  - see Diatta v Land Berlin [1985] EUECJ R-267/83;

               3. The Tribunal should have noted and  actioned  the  crucial
                  point that the  respondent  failed  in  due  diligence  in
                  seeking information for HMRC in relation to  the  spouse's
                  income and should have made an Amos direction.

        iii. Mr Tufan accepted that the judge had incorrectly  stated  that
             the relevant date was the date of divorce and not the date  of
             initiation of divorce  proceedings  but  that  the  error  was
             immaterial.  There  was  no  evidence  before  the  First-tier
             Tribunal as to the date of initiation of divorce  proceedings;
             it was not possible to state the relevant date.

         iv. Mr Tufan submitted that the only evidence  before  the  First-
             tier Tribunal regarding the former spouse's residence  in  the
             UK was a P45 that stated that Ms Fekete  left  her  employment
             with City University on 31st July 2010. Her gross pay  is  not
             noted on Part 1 (copy for employee) or  Part  2(copy  for  new
             employee. On Part 3 (for completion by new employer)  her  tax
             to date is recorded as �407.60. Her national insurance  number
             is not recorded. Mr Tufan accepted that at the date  of  issue
             of the residence permit (actual  date  unknown  but  it  seems
             sometime in 2007 or early 2008) the respondent would have been
             satisfied that his spouse was exercising Treaty Rights.

          v. The appellant married Ms Fekete on 11th August  2007.  He  was
             granted a family permit to enter the UK (no copy produced)  in
             2007 and thereafter was granted  a  5  year  residence  permit
             which expired in 2012 (no copy produced).   His  evidence  was
             that they separated about 2 � years after their  marriage  but
             that she continued to work in the UK.  A  child  was  born  in
             Hungary on 3rd July 2009 - birth certificate  produced  noting
             him as the father. The decree nisi in the divorce  proceedings
             was made on 25th June 2010 - information  extracted  from  the
             decree absolute. A respondent in a  divorce  action  (in  this
             case the appellant) has 29 days from service  of  the  divorce
             proceedings upon him to file an  acknowledgement  of  service.
             Thereafter the petitioner (in this case Ms Fekete)  can  apply
             for decree  nisi.  At  the  latest,  the  divorce  proceedings
             between Ms Fekete and the  appellant  were  more  than  likely
             instituted no later than mid-May 2010.

         vi. The First-tier Tribunal judge could have reached  a  different
             conclusion as to whether the  appellant's  former  spouse  was
             exercising Treaty Rights on the date of initiation of  divorce
             proceedings given that it appears that she  had  paid  tax  of
             �407.60 in July 2010. The First-tier Tribunal judge  erred  in
             law such that the decision is set  aside  to  be  remade.  The
             appellant did not seek an Amos direction; there is no error of
             law by the First-tier Tribunal judge in that regard but  given
             I have set aside the decision and the  directions  made,  that
             point is covered in any event.

      2. I made the following directions:

          i) The appellant to  disclose  all  the  divorce  papers  in  his
             possession or he is to  obtain  them  from  Wandsworth  County
             Court, including the child arrangements order;

         ii) The appellant to  use  his  best  endeavours  to  obtain  such
             information as he is able in connection with Child Benefit for
             his  daughter;  in  the  absence  of  such  information  being
             forthcoming he is to disclose  the  efforts  made  by  him  to
             obtain such information.

        iii) The respondent to obtain such  employment  information  as  is
             available from HMRC, DWP and  City  University  in  connection
             with the appellant's former  spouse,  Rita  Eva  Fekete  whose
             National Insurance number from the application form  completed
             in 2008 appears to be SE471634C and whose date of  birth  from
             the same form appears to be 25 December 1977.

         iv) Both parties have leave to  file  and  serve  an  indexed  and
             paginated bundle of documents that they intend to rely upon no
             later than 14 days before the date of the resumed hearing.

      3. The  respondent  produced  a  witness  statement  from  an  officer
         employed by HMRC which confirmed the appellant's former spouse  had
         been employed from the tax years 2007/2008 until 2010/2011. No date
         of ceasing employment was set out in those documents.

      4. The appellant produced a copy of a letter dated  5th  January  2016
         from City University London to the University of Pannonia,  Hungary
         which confirmed she had been employed by City University until 31st
         July 2010. The respondent did not  dispute  the  validity  of  that
         letter.

      5. I am satisfied on the basis  of  the  evidence  produced  that  the
         appellant's former spouse was exercising Treaty Rights  until  31st
         July 2010.

      6. The appellant had been unable to  obtain  a  copy  of  the  divorce
         petition. As referred to in the error of Law decision,  the  decree
         nisi was pronounced on 25th June 2010. The proceedings  would  have
         been initiated prior to that date. I am satisfied on the balance of
         probabilities that  the  appellant's  former  wife  was  exercising
         Treaty Rights in the UK  on  the  date  of  initiation  of  divorce
         proceedings.

      7. It follows from these findings -  the  only  issues  that  were  in
         dispute and upon which the First-tier Tribunal  had  made  findings
         which were the subject of appeal - that  the  appellant  meets  the
         Regulations for the grant of permanent residence.







    Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

    I set aside the decision.

    I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it.
