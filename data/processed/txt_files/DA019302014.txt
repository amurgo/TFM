                                   NOTICE

 1. This matter came before Upper Tribunal  Judge  Gleeson  on  2  February
    2016.  She made a number of directions, including the following:

        "(a) This appeal is to be  heard  at  the  Upper  Tribunal  hearing
             centre in Newport, or such other hearing centre  as  the  Upper
             Tribunal may direct, on a date to  be  fixed,  subject  to  the
             Secretary of State giving to the claimant and the  Tribunal  14
             days' notice of her intention to proceed with her appeal,  once
             the decision of the Court of Appeal in KMO is known.
        ...
       (c) If the Secretary of  State  gives  no  notice  of  intention  to
          proceed, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall  stand  and
          this appeal shall stand dismissed at the expiry of 6  months  from
          the date hereof."

 2. KMO, to which the Secretary of State was a party, was  decided  by  the
    Court of Appeal on 20 April 2016 (sub nom MM (Uganda) and  anr  v  SSHD
    [2016] EWCA Civ 450).  No notice has been received from  the  Secretary
    of State and for the avoidance of doubt I record that her appeal stands
    dismissed in accordance with Judge Gleeson's directions.



                                                           C. M. G. OCKELTON
                                        VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
