                                  JUDGMENT
                                    [pic]




    Previous orders and judgments

      1) The applicant applied on 10th January 2018 for judicial  review  of
         the respondent's decision to remove him from the UK;  and  for  the
         linked decisions in which the respondent certified his asylum claim
         on third country grounds and certified his human  rights  claim  as
         clearly unfounded, to be quashed. He also sought damages for breach
         of his rights under Article 8 of the European Convention  on  Human
         Rights ('ECHR') and under EU law, including under  the  Dublin  III
         Regulation.

      2) In the previous order and judgment of Mr Justice William  Davis  on
         4th December 2018, sitting as a Judge in the Upper Tribunal  (IAC),
         which is not recited in full for the sake of  brevity,  he  granted
         the applicant's  claim  for  judicial  review;  declared  that  the
         respondent had unlawfully removed the applicant from the UK without
         proper notice, in breach of the respondent's own policy  on  notice
         and in breach of Article 27  of  the  Dublin  III  Regulation;  and
         ordered that the decisions to remove the applicant from the UK,  to
         certify the applicant's asylum claim on third country grounds,  and
         to certify the applicant's human rights claim as clearly unfounded,
         were quashed. The same orders required the return of the  applicant
         from Germany, to where he had been removed, back to the UK.

      3) Mr Justice William Davis  did  not  carry  out  an  age  assessment
         judicial review, but nevertheless  made  adverse  findings  on  the
         adequacy of a third-party age assessment, on which he said that the
         respondent ought not to have relied in treating the applicant as an
         adult, when removing him. The applicant has never sought permission
         to apply for  judicial  review  of  the  third-party  (Lincolnshire
         County Council) age assessment.

      4) Mr Justice William Davis  also  did  not  determine  the  issue  of
         whether the applicant's removal breached his rights under Article 8
         of the ECHR and  the  resumed  hearing  was  relisted  to  consider
         liability and the applicant's claim for damages on 5th March 2020.

      5) In advance of the resumed hearing, staff of this Tribunal wrote  to
         both parties' representatives on 2nd March 2020  in  the  following
         terms:

         "In light  of  a  forthcoming  Presidential  panel  which  will  be
         considering the issue of damages for breach of Dublin III in  other
         separate  cases,  the   Tribunal   is   considering   whether   the
         determination of an award  of  damages  in  the  above  application
         should be linked to that Presidential Panel considering those other
         cases or  adjourned  pending  the  decision  in  those  cases.  The
         Tribunal therefore  intends  that  only  questions  of  "Article  8
         liability" should be addressed and considered  at  the  hearing  on
         Thursday. The parties' representatives should attend, ready to:

          1) make submissions  on  the  remaining  areas  of  liability  in
             dispute;

          2) to discuss, and if possible, agree, case management directions
             for  future  conduct  of  the  litigation,  on  the  issue  of
             damages."

      6) In the respondent's written skeleton argument dated  27th  February
         2020 (�[2(1)]) the respondent conceded that the applicant's removal
         did breach his rights to respect for his private life under Article
         8 ECHR, but asserted that no damages were  required  to  give  just
         satisfaction for the breach.

      7)  Nevertheless,  the  respondent  continued  to  dispute  that   the
         applicant had a family life with his uncle in the UK,  respect  for
         which was capable of engaging  Article  8,  which  the  applicant's
         removal had breached.

    The hearing in the upper Tribunal on 5th March 2020

      8) The sole issue that had been  identified  to  be  resolved  at  the
         hearing was whether the applicant had a family life with his  uncle
         capable of engaging Article 8 ECHR. If such family life did  exist,
         then just as the applicant's removal  had  breached  his  right  to
         respect for his private life, it would similarly breach  his  right
         to respect for his family life. It became apparent, in the  context
         of whether there was family life, that  the  applicant's  age,  and
         whether he had been a minor at the time of  his  interactions  with
         his  uncle,  remained  in  dispute.  Lincolnshire  County   Council
         confirmed on 27th November 2019 that the age  assessment  which  it
         had carried out, dated 27th April 2016, assessing the applicant  as
         19 years' old, had been withdrawn,  following  Mr  Justice  William
         Davis's conclusion that that assessment was flawed.  The  applicant
         asserted that he was a minor at the relevant time.  The  respondent
         did  not  accept  this,  notwithstanding  the  flaws  in  the   age
         assessment.

      9) This Tribunal regarded it as necessary to determine the applicant's
         age and the hearing had not been scheduled for an  age  assessment.
         The applicant was now living with his uncle in the  London  Borough
         of Sutton. This Tribunal therefore directed both parties  to  write
         to both  local  authorities,  asking  for  their  position  on  the
         applicant's  age,  with  a  further  direction  then  seeking   the
         respondent's position.

    Case management hearing by telephone on 25th March 2020

     10) The respective Councils  (Lincolnshire  and  Sutton  LBC)  did  not
         express a view on the applicant's age,  and  Covid-19  subsequently
         intervened. With the assistance of the parties' representatives,  a
         case-management hearing took  place  and  directions  were  issued,
         which are not set  out  in  full  here,  but  which  permitted  the
         respondent to contact Sutton LBC again to ascertain if  they  would
         be willing to carry out a new age assessment; and to  set  out  the
         basis of any continuing dispute on  the  applicant's  age,  in  the
         context where a German local authority  had  since  determined  the
         applicant to be a minor. In the  absence  of  subsequent  agreement
         between the parties on the applicant's age, this Tribunal  directed
         that it would reach a  decision  on  the  applicant's  age  on  the
         papers, without the need for a hearing, following which  a  further
         case management hearing would take place. Sutton  LBC  subsequently
         indicated that it had no view on the applicant's status as a minor,
         and  it  became  necessary  for  this  Tribunal  to  determine  the
         applicant's age, in light of a continuing  dispute  on  that  issue
         between the parties.

    The age assessment decision and directions

     11) By a decision dated 14th May 2020 and reissued on today's date,  to
         replace a typographical error,  this  Tribunal  declared  that  the
         applicant had a date of birth of 18 January 2000, for  the  written
         reasons set out in that decision.  The  consequence  was  that  the
         applicant was a minor when he lived with his uncle in the  UK  from
         in or around 28th April 2016, and prior to being removed to Germany
         on 11th April 2017, after which he has since been returned  to  the
         UK. The decision also included directions for future conduct of the
         litigation. The directions included seeking  clarification  on  the
         remaining issues, including:

           a. whether the respondent continued to dispute that the applicant
              had a family life with his uncle, the respect  for  which  was
              capable of engaging Article 8 ECHR; and

           b. in light of the Court of Appeal's  decision  in  Secretary  of
              State for the Home Department v R (on the application of  FTH)
              [2020] EWCA Civ 494,  whether  the  respondent  maintained  or
              sought to withdraw her previous concession that her  decisions
              breached the applicant's right  to  respect  for  his  private
              life, for the purposes of Article 8 of the ECHR.

     12) In correspondence dated 29th May 2020, the respondent  subsequently
         confirmed that she maintained  her  previous  concession  that  her
         removal of the applicant (as  opposed  to  the  other  decisions  -
         certification of the applicant's asylum and  human  rights  claims)
         was in breach of the applicant's right to respect for  his  private
         life under Article 8 ECHR, distinguishing 'R (FTH)'  on  the  basis
         that she had removed the  applicant  unlawfully  before  he  had  a
         chance to properly challenge that decision (which had  resulted  in
         its quashing by Mr Justice William Davis), and so was more  serious
         than  circumstances  where  the  Dublin  III   procedure   for   an
         unaccompanied  child  to  be  reunited  with  a  relative  remained
         available.

     13) The respondent also confirmed that she  continued  to  dispute  the
         existence of family life between the applicant and his  uncle.  The
         respondent referred to the authority of Paradiso and  Campanelli  v
         Italy (2017) 65 EHRR 22 on the relevance of the limited duration of
         cohabitation and other qualities in the relationship between and  a
         minor and relatives other than their parent.

     14) The applicant confirmed in correspondence dated 11th June 2020 that
         he continued to pursue damages for both the acknowledged breach  of
         his private life and the asserted breach of  his  family  life,  as
         well as under EU law.

    The issues to be resolved

     15) We identified and agreed with the parties that we needed to  decide
         on the following issues:

           a. Liability: while the respondent accepted that her  removal  of
              the applicant from the UK to Germany had breached  his  rights
              under Article 8 ECHR with regard to respect  for  his  private
              life, we still needed to  decide  whether  the  applicant  had
              family life with his uncle in the UK, respect  for  which  had
              been infringed as a result of  his  removal  to  Germany.  The
              respondent accepted that if we were to find that  family  life
              did exist prior to his removal, then the  applicant's  removal
              did breach his right to respect for that family life  for  the
              purposes of Article 8 ECHR.

           b. Damages:

                i. Whether an  award  of  damages  was  necessary  for  just
                   satisfaction of a breach of Article 8,  (whether  private
                   life and/or family life), or whether  a  declaration  was
                   just satisfaction for  the  respondent's  breach  of  his
                   Article 8 rights;

               ii.  Whether  the  applicant  was  entitled  to  'Francovich'
                   damages. The respondent accepted that Article 27  of  the
                   Dublin  Regulations  conferred  individually  enforceable
                   rights (see the opinion of Advocate General Sharpston  in
                   Ghezelbash v Staatssecretaris van Veiligheid en  Justitie
                   (Court of Justice of the European Union ("CJEU") Case  No
                   C-63/15)  [2016]  1   WLR   3969   ("Ghezelbash")).   The
                   respondent also accepted that there  was  a  causal  link
                   between her breach of  the  applicant's  rights  and  the
                   damage suffered by  him,  so  that  the  sole  issue  was
                   whether the conceded breach was sufficiently serious.

              iii. Assuming that an award of damages was  appropriate,  what
                   should the quantum of damages be? The  applicant  claimed
                   damages for breach of his Article 8 ECHR and EU rights of
                   �15,000; damages for the delay in vindicating  his  right
                   under EU law of �5,000; and aggravated damages of �6,000.
                   The respondent asserted that the claim for delay had been
                   impermissibly added  as  a  head  of  claim  without  any
                   application to amend the claim and it  was  too  late  to
                   make  such  an  application  at  this   late   stage   of
                   proceedings.

     16) We deal in this Judgment with each  of  the  issues  in  turn:  the
         existence of family life; whether Article 8 ECHR damages should  be
         awarded; whether 'Francovich' damages should  be  awarded;  whether
         aggravated damages should be awarded; and if damages are awarded on
         any of the heads, the amount of such damages.

    Family life

    The applicant's submissions

     17) In the particulars of claim dated  18th  January  2019  (�[8])  the
         applicant asserted (and it is not disputed) that he was living with
         his uncle at the time of his removal and given his minority and his
         vulnerability, their relationship constituted family life  for  the
         purposes of Article 8 ECHR.

     18) In the written skeleton argument  dated  20th  February  2020,  the
         applicant  asserted  that  the  situation   was,   on   any   view,
         exceptional. He was (i) extremely vulnerable; (ii)  highly  reliant
         on his uncle; (iii) a child; and (iv) both he  and  his  uncle  had
         fled persecution, which was relevant to  the  existence  of  family
         life: see Entry Clearance Officer, Addis Ababa v H (Somalia) [2004]
         UKIAT 00027; Tuquabo-Tek1e and others  v  Netherlands  (Application
         no: 60665/00).

     19) The applicant distinguished his case from those relied upon by  the
         respondent where family  life  had  been  deliberately  created  by
         adults at a time when one party was living in the UK unlawfully. He
         had a family life with his uncle. The respondent's  assertion  that
         the applicant  and  his  uncle  would  have  known  about  the  age
         assessment conducted by Lincolnshire County Council, which assessed
         the applicant as an adult and  consequently  they  could  not  have
         assumed that the applicant would be  allowed  to  remain  with  his
         uncle, was not  consistent  with  the  reality  of  the  situation,
         specifically that the applicant and his uncle could not have  known
         that the respondent would unlawfully fail to apply the  Dublin  III
         Regulation in removing him.

     20) While the authority of Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 31  remained
         good law, the applicant's case fell within the narrow paradigm of a
         child and a blood relative caring for him. There  was  no  need  to
         consider whether there were more than normal emotional ties between
         the applicant and his uncle, as  that  analysis  applied  to  adult
         relatives. The alternative case of Paradiso and Campanelli v  Italy
         (Application number: 25358/12) was not  relevant,  noting  in  that
         case that there was neither a biological relationship  between  the
         putative parents and child, nor a legally recognised  relationship.
         It was  in  those  circumstances  that  the  Strasbourg  court  had
         considered the duration of cohabitation and quality of the putative
         parental relationship.

     21) Instead, we should focus on the ordinary ties between the applicant
         and his uncle as being "real" and "normal" within  the  meaning  of
         Marckx v Belgium [1979] 2 EHRR 330. The respondent's denial of  the
         existence of family life was at odds with the wider recognition  of
         the expanded  concept  of  family  life  beyond  those  limited  to
         consanguinity  or  marriage  and  included  opposite  sex   couples
         (Whittington Hospital NHS Trust v XX [2020] UKSC 14);  foster  care
         arrangements (AU v SSHD [2020] EWCA Civ 338); and  extended  family
         relationships (Singh v Entry clearance  officer  New  Delhi  [2004]
         EWCA Civ 1075). Family life had been held to exist between an uncle
         and niece or nephew, for example, see: Boyle v UK  (1994)  19  EHRR
         179.

     22) Even if it were suggested that the  applicant's  relationship  with
         his uncle fell outside  the  quintessential  family  paradigm,  the
         requirements of Kugathas, specifically a  dependency  amounting  to
         more than emotional ties was plainly met,  noting  his  exceptional
         vulnerability  and  the  background  of  both  fleeing  Afghanistan
         because of persecution. While Mr  Justice  William  Davis  made  no
         finding  as  to  the  applicant's  vulnerability,  he  doubted  the
         validity  of  the  respondent's  argument  that   the   applicant's
         relationship with his uncle gave no rise to a significant level  of
         dependency, (�[25] of that judgment).

     23) The two had been part of the same household in Afghanistan and  the
         uncle had looked after the applicant within less than  a  fortnight
         after the applicant entered the UK.

     24) When we canvassed whether there was a necessity for reciprocity  in
         a familial  relationship  between  the  applicant  and  his  uncle,
         specifically  in  the  context  of  assertions  about  the  initial
         reticence on the part of the uncle to help  the  applicant  in  any
         way, Ms Naik submitted that this was not a claim by the uncle of  a
         family relationship with the applicant, as one might have in family
         reunion cases, but instead a claim by the applicant and  we  should
         consider  the  claim  solely  from  the  child's  perspective.  The
         existence of family life did not require reciprocity - a baby could
         not, for example,  reciprocate  in  any  way.  In  any  event,  the
         applicant's relationship with his uncle  was  a  paradigm  case  of
         cohabitation and dependency.

     25) The fact that the applicant might have close relations for an equal
         length of time with a wider network of those supporting him in  the
         UK such as two volunteer workers,  one  of  whom  he  addressed  as
         "mum," did not take away from the dependency between the  applicant
         and his uncle. Any  reference  to  "mum"  might  be  reflective  of
         culturally explicable respect for older adults.

     26) Moreover, as confirmed by the uncle's first witness statement,  the
         uncle, "DD", initially lived with the applicant and his  mother  in
         2000 in Afghanistan  and  had  since  visited  Afghanistan  on  two
         further occasions prior to the applicant  coming  to  UK  in  2016.
         Whilst the respondent  suggested  that  DD  had  been  reticent  in
         becoming involved with the applicant, as indicated at �[12] of DD's
         witness statement, DD had not ruled out helping the  applicant  and
         had merely said that he could not look after the applicant and that
         the applicant should remain in  his  accommodation  "for  the  time
         being"[pic]

     27) Whilst DD had then left the UK in late September 2017 for  40  days
         to visit  Afghanistan,  it  was  reasonable  to  suppose  that  the
         applicant was cared  for  by  DD's  wife,  although  there  was  no
         evidence on this, whether in terms of a witness statement from DD's
         wife, DD's children; in the correspondence from volunteer  workers;
         from the applicant himself in his two witness statements,  in  DD's
         two witness statements; or in the various medical reports.

     28) This Tribunal needed to evaluate the  applicant's  family  life  of
         cohabitation as a minor with an older family relative, in  contrast
         to the case of Entry Clearance Officer, Sierra Leone v Kopoi [2017]
         EWCA Civ 1511, where there was an absence of cohabitation prior  to
         the refusal  of  entry  clearance.  In  that  case,  there  was  no
         dependency between the applicant and the sponsor, despite emotional
         ties felt on both sides which did not go  beyond  normal  emotional
         ties experienced in very many families.

     29) When we asked Ms Naik whether the applicant asserted that he had  a
         family life with DD before the applicant's arrival  in  the  UK  in
         April 2016, she indicated that the applicant did not need  to  show
         the existence of such family life before that date. We knew that DD
         was present at the applicant's birth  and  briefly  cohabited  with
         him. While we do not know the nature of their relationship  between
         2000 to 2016, what was relevant was the existence of family life at
         the date of the applicant's removal. The argument that  because  of
         the precariousness of the status of the applicant in the UK,  there
         was no such family life, ignored the context that the applicant was
         entitled to claim asylum as an unaccompanied minor  with  a  family
         member in the UK under the Dublin III Regulation. He was  therefore
         not removable pending a decision on that claim and the respondent's
         reference to precariousness ignored that context.

     30) Referring to the case of Uddin v SSHD  12020]  EWCA  Civ  338,  the
         Court of Appeal re-emphasised  the  need  for  real  and  effective
         family ties; and also at �[31] that "dependency" was not a "term of
         art", but a matter of substance over form. There was no rigid  test
         of exceptional dependency (�[32]).

     31) The case of R (Ahmadi  &  Ahmadi)  v  SSHD  [2005]  EWCA  Civ  1721
         demonstrated the limited role that duration of  cohabitation  could
         play - the brothers in that case had only cohabited for weeks.

    The Respondent's submissions

     32) The respondent disputed that there was a family  life  between  the
         applicant and DD prior to the applicant's  removal  to  Germany  on
         11th April 2017, despite their cohabitation in the UK  from  in  or
         around 28th April 2016. In  summary,  the  respondent  asserted  as
         follows:

          a) the applicant was not a member of  DD's  immediate  family  as
             opposed to an extended family member, applying  the  authority
             of Kugathas and there was no pattern of support provided by DD
             prior to the applicant's unlawful entry to UK;

          b) co-habitation for a ten-month period (taking into account DD's
             absence in Afghanistan) was not long enough  to  constitute  a
             family life, see the authority of Paradiso and  Campagnelli  v
             Italy (application no: 25358/12); which could be distinguished
             from the case of D  and  others  v  Belgium  (application  no:
             29176/13), where  there  had  been  a  direct  biological  tie
             between at least one of the parents and the child;

          c) the applicant did not have a previous history of  family  life
             with DD before he moved in  with  him  and  DD  had  initially
             refused to help the applicant;

          d) prior to his time living with DD, the applicant was aware that
             the arrangement was precarious, given that he had entered  the
             UK illegally and had not established the right  to  remain  in
             the UK for any period. In  the  circumstances,  the  applicant
             could not assume that the arrangement of living  with  DD  had
             'sufficient constancy' to constitute family life;

          e) the applicant's position became especially precarious when  he
             was assessed, albeit inaccurately, as an adult by Lincolnshire
             County Council;

          f) the applicant must also have been aware that his  fingerprints
             had previously been recorded in both Germany  and  Greece,  in
             which countries he had, by his own admission, lied and claimed
             to be an adult, making a transfer back under  the  Dublin  III
             Regulation to those countries at least a realistic prospect.

     33) Kugathas confirmed that neither blood ties  nor  natural  affection
         between family members was sufficient to establish family life  and
         there was no presumption that a  person  had  a  family  life  with
         relatives, even within their immediate family  (�[19]  and  �[24]).
         The claim of  family  life  in  Kopoi  had  been  rejected  as  the
         applicant was not a member of her cousin's  immediate  family,  was
         not dependent on them; and had not established a pattern of support
         from them (�[20]). The case of Boyle, where there was  family  life
         between uncle and nephew was in sharp contrast to  the  applicant's
         facts. In Boyle the uncle had had contact throughout the  nine-year
         old's life; the nephew would often stay with his uncle at weekends;
         the uncle saw his nephew every night for the first  five  years  of
         the child's life; lived only a short distance  away  from  him  and
         both were British citizens.

     34) In the case of Paradiso, the court  rejected  the  assertion  of  a
         family life when considering other de facto family ties. The  court
         had assessed the existence of family  ties,  and  relevant  factors
         included whether the relationship had sufficient constancy (�[40]).
         Ms Naik's submission of a clear demarcation line  between  Kugathas
         and Paradiso was not sustainable. The court  accepted  in  Paradiso
         that there could  be  de  facto  family  life  in  the  absence  of
         biological or legal ties including foster parents  and  even  where
         the court refused to recognise an adoption order made by a court of
         another  country.  Pulling  the  strands  together,  the  court  in
         Paradiso at �[151] stated that it was  necessary  to  consider  the
         quality of ties, the roles played by the  applicant  vis-a-vis  the
         other family  member  and  the  duration  of  cohabitation.  Whilst
         Paradiso confirmed that it was inappropriate to  define  a  minimum
         duration of shared life, the duration of the  relationship  was  an
         important factor. In the case of Paradiso,  the  putative  father's
         mistaken  belief  that  he  was  the  biological  father  did   not
         compensate for the short duration  of  the  cohabitation  of  eight
         months.

     35) Whilst there was a need to scrutinise the facts carefully, it was a
         trap to say that the legal authorities provided no guidance on  the
         broad parameters in which family life existed, as  otherwise  there
         would be no difference between family and private life.

     36) Considering the authorities referred to in Paradiso at �[149],  the
         court considered Moretti and Benedetti v Italy (application  number
         16318/07)  of  family  life  between  a  baby  and   carers   where
         cohabitation began when the child was a month old; the cohabitation
         had endured and had now reached 19 months and the carers had shared
         the first important stages of the baby's young life.

     37) In Kopf and Liberda v Austria (application  number  1598/06)  there
         was family life between the foster family  and  looked-after  child
         where the care had started when the child was aged two and had  now
         lasted 46 months.

     38) In Wagner and JMWL v Luxembourg (application number 76240/01) close
         family ties had existed for over 10 years.

     39) However, as Paradiso emphasised, the duration of  cohabitation  was
         not the sole factor, but the quality of ties  was  also  important.
         Paradiso went on to assess whether there could be private  life  in
         the absence of family life and private life was a broad concept.

     40) Returning to Kugathas, Lady Justice Arden reiterated  that  it  was
         necessary to scrutinise the precise facts. On any  legal  analysis,
         no Article 8 family life existed between the applicant and DD prior
         to the applicant's arrival in the UK in April 2016. The case  of  R
         (Ahmadi and Ahmadi) [2005] EWCA Civ 171 was not on all  fours  with
         the  applicant's  case,  as  in  that  case,  the  sibling   family
         relationship was in the context of one of  the  brothers  suffering
         from schizophrenia with  florid  symptoms  and  the  other  brother
         acting as his protector. Taking the applicant's  and  DD's  witness
         statements at their highest, the applicant had been born in January
         2000; DD had left Afghanistan in  the  winter  of  2000,  when  the
         applicant was not even a toddler, and DD left  as  an  adult.  They
         next lived together sixteen years later. DD had the opportunity  to
         see  the  applicant  regularly  as  soon  as  he  obtained  British
         citizenship and visited Afghanistan but saw him briefly,  twice  in
         those 16 years, not staying with the  applicant's  family  and  the
         applicant's family travelling to visit him.

     41) Contrary to the applicant's case,  the  evidence  did  not  support
         heavy dependency on DD once the applicant entered the  UK.  DD  had
         initially refused to help him (see  �[12]  of  DD's  first  witness
         statement), in contrast to the uncle in Boyle  who  was  ready  and
         willing from the outset and over  a  nine-year  period  to  assist.
         Moreover even after the initial refusal, DD took no  initiative  in
         offering further help or enquiring after the applicant and  it  was
         only when the police contacted DD again, following a change in  the
         applicant's  accommodation,  that  he  agreed  to  accommodate  the
         applicant.

     42) In terms of interactions between the two when they were cohabiting,
         as DD's first witness statement confirmed at �[15] to [19], DD felt
         that there was very little he could do to  support  the  applicant.
         Most of the day, the applicant isolated himself in his room  alone;
         the applicant would play with DD's  children  and  on  DD's  return
         home, would then  withdraw  away  from  DD.  DD  stated  that  this
         behaviour meant it was difficult for  a  strong  connection  to  be
         established between the two. In reality, the applicant relied  much
         more on local health  services;  from  2017,  an  English  language
         course at college; and local charities and support workers. He  was
         getting external support which  was  in  contrast  to  the  limited
         support provided by DD. Bearing  in  mind  that  DD  had  initially
         refused to help him, prior to the applicant's entry to the UK,  the
         applicant could have no reasonable expectation that DD  would  help
         him. This suggested an absence of constancy  of  family  life.  The
         absence of unwavering support (contrast Boyle); the limited support
         that  was  eventually  provided;  and  the  limited   duration   of
         cohabitation (11 months, less a period of 40 days when DD left  the
         applicant and there is no evidence of who cared for  the  applicant
         while DD was away) demonstrated a lack of reciprocity. It was  this
         reciprocity that distinguished family life from private  life.  The
         former was a mutual enjoyment of  a  collective  unit  whereas  the
         latter was the exploration of other relationships which may or  may
         not be reciprocated.

     43) Contrary to the applicant's assertions, it was also  relevant  that
         the applicant had entered the UK irregularly and  not  through  the
         Dublin III channel.

    Family Life - the Law

     44) We considered first of all the scope of Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA
         Civ  31,  and   whether   it   supported   the   proposition   that
         consanguinity, cohabitation and dependence were sufficient to  form
         the basis of family life without  the  need  for  consideration  of
         real,  effective  or  committed  support;  the   quality   of   the
         relationship; a consideration of wider ties; and  the  duration  of
         cohabitation. The Court in Kugathas quotes, at �[14], the case of S
         v United Kingdom (1984) 40 DR 196:

         "Generally, the protection of family life under Article 8  involves
         cohabiting dependents, such as parents and their  dependent,  minor
         children. Whether it extends to other relationships depends on  the
         circumstances of the particular case. Relationships between adults,
         a mother and her 33 year old son in the  present  case,  would  not
         necessarily acquire the protection of Article 8 of  the  Convention
         without evidence of further elements of dependency, involving  more
         than the normal emotional ties. "

     45) Kugathas involved a single adult male challenging refusal of  entry
         clearance. The Court noted that when  assessing  family  life,  the
         analysis was different between entry and removal cases (�[14])  and
         at �[17] that there was no requirement of dependency,  particularly
         in an economic sense. However, there was an irreducible minimum  of
         real, committed or effective support  for  family  life  to  engage
         Article 8. The Court went on to state at �[19]:

         "Returning to the present case, neither blood ties nor the  concern
         and affection that ordinarily go with them are,  by  themselves  or
         together, in my judgment enough to constitute family life. Most  of
         us have close relations of whom we are extremely fond and  whom  we
         visit, or who visit us, from time to time; but none of us would say
         on those grounds alone that we share a family life with them in any
         sense capable of coming within the meaning and purpose  of  Article
         8"[pic]

     46) It continued at �[24]:

         "There is no presumption that a person has a family life, even with
         the members of a  person's  immediate  family.  The  court  has  to
         scrutinise the relevant factors. Such factors  include  identifying
         who are the near relatives of the  appellant,  the  nature  of  the
         links between them and the appellant, the  age  of  the  appellant,
         where and with whom he has resided in the past, and  the  forms  of
         contact he has maintained with the other members of the family with
         whom he claims to have a family life. "

     47) The Court of Appeal in Uddin v SSHD [2020] EWCA Civ 338  reaffirmed
         and applied Kugathas, in the context of the applicant  becoming  an
         adult while living with foster parents. At �[31], the Court began:

         "[31] Dependency, in the Kugathas sense, is accordingly not a  term
         of art. It is a question of fact, a matter of substance  not  form.
         The irreducible minimum of what family life  implies  remains  that
         which Sedley LJ described as  being  whether  support  is  real  or
         effective or committed.

         [32] Subsequent case law has built  upon  but  not  detracted  from
         Kugathas. In Ghising v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
         [2012] UKUT 160 (IAC), Lang J sitting with UT Judge Jordan  in  the
         UT considered the authorities since Kugathas,  They  observed  that
         family life between adult children and  their  birth  parents  will
         readily be found without evidence of exceptional dependence. In  so
         far as it has been suggested that Kugathas  had  ever  described  a
         rigid test of exceptional dependency,  this  was  dispelled  and  I
         respectfully agree with their conclusion that  each  case  is  fact
         sensitive. "

     48) At �[34], the Court continued:

         "The Secretary of State goes further and submits that  foster  care
         is a "special category", in which it is incumbent upon an applicant
         to prove family life in a way that would otherwise be presumed in a
         birth family. I can find no support for  this  proposition  in  the
         case law. The principles in Kugathas, as described in the judgments
         to which I have referred, are of general application. I can discern
         no intention, articulated or implied, to limit the test of real  or
         effective or committed support to birth families. Rather,  at  para
         18 of Kugathas the court describes the special case  which  is  the
         converse of that asserted by the Secretary of State, namely that in
         some cases a natural tie between parent and infant may displace the
         principle of general application that a family life will need to be
         proved based on the substance of the relationship asserted. "

     49) At �[40], the Court drew together the following principles:

         "(i) The test for the establishment of Article 8 family life in the
         Kugathas sense is one of  effective,  real  or  committed  support.
         There is no requirement to prove exceptional dependency.

         (ii) The test for family life within the foster care context is  no
         different to that of birth families: the court or tribunal looks to
         the substance of the relationship and no significant  determinative
         weight is to be given to  the  formal  commerciality  of  a  foster
         arrangement. It is simply a factual question to be  considered,  if
         relevant, alongside all others.

         (iii) The continued existence of family life after  the  attainment
         of majority is also  a  relevant  question  of  fact.  No  negative
         inference should be drawn from the mere fact of the  attainment  of
         majority, while continuing cohabitation  after  adulthood  will  be
         suggestive of ongoing real, effective or committed support which is
         the hallmark of a family life."

     50) Whilst Kugathas gave the example of a paradigm case as an adult and
         their dependent minor children and referred, in discussing  further
         dependency,  to  adult  children,  we   accept   the   respondent's
         submission that there is no hard-line  between  on  the  one  hand,
         consanguineous,  cohabiting  and   dependent   relatives   (whether
         immediate family members or otherwise),  beyond  which  no  further
         enquiry need to be made as to the extent of real  or  effective  or
         committed support; and on the other hand,  cases  where  the  three
         criteria (consanguinity etc.) are not all met and a wider  analysis
         is necessary. We are fortified in this conclusion not only  by  the
         reference at �[19] of Kugathas to  consanguineous  relations  where
         family members are fond of one another and may  visit  one  another
         (without any stipulation as to the duration  of  that  visit);  but
         also the Court of Appeal's clear direction that the  principles  in
         Kugathas  are  of  general  application;  without  the   need   for
         exceptional dependency and with a careful scrutiny of the facts. We
         accept  that  factors  such  as  lack  of  consanguinity;  lack  of
         cohabitation;  and  the  lack  of  dependency,  particularly  in  a
         financial sense will be relevant to a pattern of real, effective or
         committed support but we do not accept that we should exclude  from
         our analysis the duration of cohabitation; nor,  while  noting  the
         duty to promote the best interests of children under section 55  of
         the Border, Citizenship and Immigration  2009,  of  which  we  have
         taken full account,  should  we  limit  our  analysis  because  the
         applicant in question is, or was at the  time  of  his  removal,  a
         child.

     51) We further accept the respondent's  submission  that  the  support,
         which is the irreducible minimum for family life to engage  Article
         8 ECHR, is one which is typically reciprocal in nature, but  it  is
         important not to  confuse  reciprocity  with  equivalence.  In  the
         paradigm case of consanguineous parents and their  child,  contrary
         to Ms Naik's submission that there could not be reciprocity between
         a  baby  and  their  parents  because  the  child  is   unable   to
         reciprocate, being  wholly  dependent,  in  fact  the  support  can
         properly be analysed as being two-way: an  absolute  dependency  by
         the child from its perspective; and an acceptance by the parents of
         responsibility. To draw a different distinction, where there  is  a
         desire by a child, even a  minor  one,  for  parental  or  familial
         support, (which we remind ourselves does not  need  to  be  a  high
         level  of  dependency)  but  the  parent  refuses  to  accept  such
         responsibility, there may not be the real, effective  or  committed
         support which is necessary as the  irreducible  minimum  of  family
         life. That is equally consistent with the absence of Article 8 ECHR
         family life between, for example, an uncle and nephews  and  nieces
         where there might be  real  affection  and  even,  on  occasion,  a
         willingness to provide assistance, but not as part of  a  committed
         pattern of support.

     52) It is in the context of our analysis that the case of  Paradiso  is
         consistent with Kugathas and provides additional  guidance  on  the
         nature of support. The analysis in  Paradiso  of  the  duration  of
         cohabitation and the quality of the relationship is consistent with
         the irreducible minimum requirement and is an example of the  wider
         assessment of facts which is  not  only  permissible,  but  may  be
         necessary in cases of consanguineous relations, just as  for  those
         lacking consanguinity. The Court in that case was careful  to  note
         that there was no minimum period of cohabitation.

    Discussion and conclusions on family life

     53) We discussed with Ms Naik the  extent  of  the  findings  which  we
         needed to make to decide the issue of family life. The  context  of
         the discussion is that the applicant has yet to have a  substantive
         asylum interview, prior to which the respondent would then be  able
         to decide whether his outstanding protection claim is  accepted  or
         resisted. Ms Naik indicated that it was necessary for  us  to  make
         findings on whether the applicant's father  and  brother  had  been
         murdered, which the applicant had witnessed and as result of  which
         he had fled Afghanistan. She argued that we need to do  so  because
         of Afghan culture, of which we needed to take judicial notice, that
         the loss of the applicant's father would in turn contextualise  the
         applicant's  desire  to  be  reunited  with  his  sole  older  male
         relative, DD, in the UK. She asserted, but did not direct us to any
         evidence, that there would be a de facto  transfer  of  patriarchal
         responsibility from deceased father to DD as 'head of the  family',
         so  that  greater  weight  should  be  placed  on  the  applicant's
         relationship with DD as his de facto father. We discussed  with  Ms
         Naik the  alternative  that  it  would  be  possible  to  take  the
         applicant's case at its highest for the purposes of  this  judicial
         review, except where necessary, so that we do not  impinge  on  any
         subsequent possible decisions or appeal  against  an  asylum  claim
         which has yet to be assessed by the respondent. On the one hand, we
         were conscious that the applicant cannot be criticised for the fact
         that the respondent has yet to assess his claim. On the other hand,
         large parts of the applicant's claim before us are  undisputed,  in
         particular his significant mental vulnerabilities. We regard it  as
         appropriate that we take the remainder of his claim at its highest,
         without making any findings  in  relation  to  issues  which  might
         impinge on an assessment of his  protection  claim,  unless  it  is
         necessary for us to  do  so.  We  note,  in  any  event,  that  the
         invitation to take judicial notice of what was submitted to be, but
         without evidence to which we  were  directed,  a  general  cultural
         aspect of Afghan society that there is an  assumption  of  parental
         responsibility by a surviving maternal male relative on the loss of
         a male parent appears inconsistent with the facts  here,  where  DD
         initially refused to help the applicant and where he had  not  been
         informed of the applicant's imminent arrival in the UK.

     54) As we had previously found, the applicant was born  in  Afghanistan
         on 18th January 2000. DD lived briefly with the applicant  and  his
         parents in a shared home and was present at the applicant's  birth.
         DD describes at �[4] of his first witness statement  (page  E78  of
         the applicant's bundle ("AB")) leaving Afghanistan in the winter of
         2000  when  the  applicant  was  crawling.  The  cohabitation   was
         therefore very brief (a matter of months) and the  applicant  would
         have had no recollection of DD at that time.

     55) DD then left Afghanistan in the winter of 2000 and  claimed  asylum
         in the UK and was recognised as a refugee in 2001. It follows  from
         the recognition of his  refugee  status  that  DD  did  not  simply
         abandon his relatives out of choice  but  had  a  genuine  fear  of
         persecution and we take this  into  account  in  assessing  whether
         family life subsequently existed between the applicant and DD.

     56) DD applied for indefinite leave  to  remain  and  was  subsequently
         granted British citizenship on 15th February 2008, following  which
         he visited Afghanistan on three occasions, two of which were  prior
         to the applicant leaving Afghanistan. The  first  occasion  was  in
         July 2008 and the second was in July 2011. DD confirmed that he did
         not visit the applicant's home but instead remained  at  his  "own"
         family's home in Mazar-e-Sharif. He drew  the  distinction  between
         his family and  the  applicant's.  The  applicant  and  his  family
         visited DD's family in Mazar-e-Sharif and it was  common  for  them
         travel to that city to visit relatives.

     57) The applicant arrived in the UK clandestinely on 13th  April  2016.
         He  was  encountered  by  the  authorities   almost   straightaway;
         confirmed to them that he was a minor;  and  was  taken  to  nearby
         Lincolnshire  County  Council's  childrens'  services   staff   for
         assessment.  During  that  time  until  28th  April  2016  he   was
         accommodated by Lincolnshire County Council's childrens'  services.
         The applicant claims that through a person whom the  applicant  had
         met in Peterborough, he contacted DD. DD's  account  is  different,
         stating that he received a call from the police explaining that the
         applicant asked to stay with him. At �[11] of  DD's  first  witness
         statement, he continued:

         "[11] As a result of conversations with  [the  applicant]  and  his
         mother, [S], after [the applicant] arrived in the UK, I have become
         aware  of  the  terrible  experiences  which  he  went  through  in
         Afghanistan, where his  father  and  brother  were  killed  and  he
         himself was tortured. [The applicant] has also told me about how he
         fled Afghanistan and travelled to the UK. [The applicants']  family
         had not told me that he had fled from Afghanistan, and it was  only
         made aware he was in the UK after I was contacted by the police.

         [12] In April or June 2016, I received  a  call  from  the  police,
         telling me that [the applicant] had arrived in the UK.  The  police
         explained that [the applicant] had asked to stay with  me.  When  I
         first talked to [the applicant], I told him I couldn't  look  after
         him. I explained  to  him  that  he  should  stay  in  his  current
         accommodation for time being. I was concerned I couldn't afford  to
         look after the applicant, as I have two  young  children.  At  that
         point I  didn't  know  anything  about  his  case.  As  the  police
         explained to me that [the applicant] had applied for asylum, I  was
         also concerned that I did not have the money to pay for a solicitor
         to assist with his claim.

     13] Several weeks later the police called me again and  explained  that
         the applicant had tried to walk to London  to  find  my  house  and
         desperately wanted to stay with me.  I  travelled  to  Peterborough
         that evening and picked [the applicant] up from the police station.

     14] When [the applicant] first came under my care, I was not  aware  of
         the severity of his mental health condition prior to his arrival in
         Sutton. We were not informed by the police or by the  council  that
         had been responsible for his care since his arrival in the UK about
         the severity or complexity of his mental health concerns. I do  not
         think his mental health was ever examined by social  services  when
         he originally arrived in the UK.

         [15] When I first [the applicant] [sic] he was very  happy  to  see
         me, and appeared normal. But it was only after  the  first  several
         nights that I realised that [the applicant] was  suffering  greatly
         from the trauma had experienced in Afghanistan. I often would  find
         him awake in the middle of the night, and he would tell me that  he
         was having flashbacks where he could see the death of  his  brother
         and finding his father's body. I felt like I could  not  help  [the
         applicant], and I did not know what to do."

     58) Prior to the initial telephone call, either from the police or  the
         acquaintance with whom the applicant made contact in  Peterborough,
         it is clear at �[11] of DD's witness  statement  that  he  was  not
         aware that the applicant had left Afghanistan or that  he  was  the
         focus and proposed  end-destination  for  the  applicant.  Ms  Naik
         suggested in submissions that there had been an  agreement  between
         the applicant's mother and DD for the transfer  of  responsibility.
         Even taking DD's evidence at its  highest,  that  is  an  assertion
         unsupported by any evidence  to  which  we  were  directed  and  is
         contradicted by DD's lack of knowledge of the  applicant's  arrival
         in the UK, which also explained his clear unwillingness,  at  least
         initially, to look  after  the  applicant.  Just  as  DD  drew  the
         distinction between his own family  and  that  of  the  applicant's
         family in his prior visits to Afghanistan in 2008 and 2011,  so  he
         also drew the distinction between the applicant on the one hand and
         his own two  young  children  on  the  other  when  explaining  his
         refusal. He makes clear in his statement at �[11] that he  did  not
         know anything about the applicant's case until after the  applicant
         arrived in the UK.

     59) Ms Naik submitted that DD  then  accepted  responsibility  for  the
         applicant because he had taken into account the applicant's  mental
         health issues. That is not an assertion  that,  once  again  taking
         DD's evidence at its highest, is supported by evidence, because  as
         DD's witness statement made clear, he did not know  anything  about
         the applicant's mental health  issues  until  after  the  applicant
         began living with him.

     60) Ms Naik also submitted that the initial refusal was also  qualified
         as being for the "time being." She submitted that DD's  refusal  to
         assist the applicant was only intended to be temporary,  whilst  he
         made arrangements in order to assist the applicant  and  that  this
         refusal was only maintained for a couple of weeks until DD took the
         applicant in on 28th April 2016.  In  particular,  Ms  Naik  argued
         against any suggestion that DD  was  only  willing  to  assist  the
         applicant because of pressure from the police.

     61) The timing of DD's willingness to assist the applicant is explained
         in three events in around late April 2016. The first was a  Eurodac
         search on 28th April 2016 (page D32, AB) which confirmed  that  the
         applicant had been fingerprinted in both Germany and Greece and had
         claimed to be aged 20 to those authorities. The second was  an  age
         assessment conducted by Lincolnshire social services as recorded in
         the GCID records (page D33  AB),  albeit  an  assessment  that  was
         subsequently regarded as deficient by Mr Justice William Davis. The
         consequence of that age  assessment  was  that  the  applicant  was
         informed  by  social  workers  that  he   was   no   longer   their
         responsibility and that he was going to be moved into  new,  adult,
         accommodation. Third, the applicant  then  sought  assistance  from
         social services; who contacted the police, who  in  turn  contacted
         DD. None of this was at the instigation  of  DD  and  there  is  no
         suggestion or evidence that DD communicated with the  applicant  in
         the meantime to check on his  welfare,  even  though  he  knew  the
         applicant was a minor.

     62) Ms Naik suggested that the question of whether family life  existed
         prior to the applicant's entry to the UK was not relevant and  that
         we should consider family life at the date on which  the  applicant
         was subsequently removed on 11th April 2017. We agree  that  family
         life needed to have existed at the date on which it  is  said  that
         his removal engaged the protection of Article 8, namely 11th  April
         2017, but we do not regard it as impermissible for us  to  consider
         the history and quality of the applicant's relations with DD and in
         particular whether there was a pattern of support over part or  the
         whole of that period up to 11th April 2017.

     63) Even taking DD's evidence at its highest, it does not  support  any
         contention that family life,  so  as  to  engage  protection  under
         Article 8 ECHR, existed prior to the applicant's entry to the UK in
         2016. We conclude this for the following reasons:  first,  although
         we accept that DD  left  Afghanistan,  not  of  his  own  choosing,
         nevertheless DD's cohabitation with the applicant was  for  a  very
         brief period in 2000 when the applicant was an infant and would not
         have remembered DD living  with  him.  Second,  while  we  make  no
         criticism of  DD,  on  obtaining  British  citizenship,  he  almost
         immediately returned to  Afghanistan  to  visit,  but  he  did  not
         subsequently recommence cohabitation  with  the  applicant  or  his
         family and they merely visited one another on two occasions in 2008
         and 2011. We do not regard such brief visits as the  recommencement
         of family relations in the sense that they would engage  Article  8
         ECHR. Using  Ms  Naik's  own  test,  whilst  they  remained  "blood
         relations", there was no cohabitation; nor is there any  suggestion
         of any dependency, for example by way of financial  remittances  or
         any particular emotional or other pattern of committed support.

     64) The absence of a  pattern  of  support  in  a  real,  effective  or
         committed sense is illustrated by the fact  that  DD  was  entirely
         unaware of the applicant's arrival in UK or his journey to  the  UK
         beforehand, notwithstanding  the  fact  that  DD  had  remained  in
         contact with the family previously and there is no suggestion  that
         DD was unable to speak with the applicant's  mother  prior  to  the
         applicant leaving Afghanistan. There was no prior acceptance by  DD
         of the transfer of responsibility as part of  a  wider  pattern  of
         committed  support.  There  is  no  evidence  that  DD   was   even
         particularly close to the applicant's family prior to 2016.

     65) When analysing the relationship  in  the  context  of  reciprocity,
         there is no evidence that the applicant was dependent on  DD  prior
         to entering the UK, as he travelled  from  Afghanistan  across  the
         world during the course of 2015/2016. There could be no reciprocity
         on DD's  part  as  DD  was  entirely  unaware  of  the  applicant's
         intentions or travel.

     66) Once again, while we do not criticise DD,  we  regard  his  initial
         refusal to assist the applicant  as  telling  in  analysing  family
         life. We do not accept the DD's refusal was qualified by the phrase
         "for the time being." DD's concern  that  he  would  be  unable  to
         support his own family financially (with two young  children)  does
         not suggest DD was seeking to make alternative arrangements to help
         the applicant while refusing him support for a temporary period.

     67) We accept that there is no suggestion that the police pressured  DD
         into helping the applicant, but it is  clear  from  �[13]  of  DD's
         first witness statement, where he records the applicant  as  having
         tried to walk to London to find his house and  desperately  wanting
         to stay with him, that DD felt he had little choice but  to  accept
         the applicant.

     68) The  applicant  then  lived  with  DD  and  his  family  until  his
         subsequent removal on 11th April  2017.  We  come  on  to  consider
         whether, even if there  was  not  Article  8  family  life  on  the
         applicant's  arrival  in  the  UK,  family  life  subsequently  was
         established and developed between the applicant and  DD  on  living
         together. DD accepted a willingness to help him. He also  attempted
         to register the applicant with the  local  GP  when  the  applicant
         attempted suicide, fairly early on in their cohabitation in May  or
         June 2016.

     69) The evidence also suggests that while accommodating the  applicant,
         the relationship between DD and  the  applicant  was  strained  and
         their contact was in fact very limited. As DD recorded at �[19]  of
         his first witness statement, most of the day,  when  the  applicant
         was in the family home, he would sleep and stay in his room  alone.
         He played games with DD's children when they came back from school.
         DD said that while from  the  beginning,  he  tried  to  treat  the
         applicant as his own son, whenever DD's children were  absent,  the
         applicant reverted to the  same  withdrawn  state,  within  a  room
         alone. DD candidly admitted to it being difficult  to  establish  a
         strong connection with the applicant.

     70) DD then visited Afghanistan in late  September  2016  for  40  days
         including visiting his own family, at which point he met  with  the
         applicant's mother. The period of DD's absence from the  UK  was  a
         not insignificant period during which time there  was  no  evidence
         about the basis of ongoing support or contact between  DD  and  the
         applicant;  or  how  his  undoubted  mental   health   issues   and
         vulnerability were supported. On DD's return to the UK which  would
         have been in November 2016, DD did make  efforts  to  register  the
         applicant with an  English  language  college  but  it  is  unclear
         whether DD paid for  this.  The  suggestion  is  that  his  limited
         finances made this impossible, but there was then some form of  fee
         remission which made the applicant's attendance possible.

     71) DD refers at �[23] to the applicant's mental health improving after
         attending college and making friends through  the  Refugee  Network
         and contacts at a support group. In particular,  one  volunteer  at
         that support group, "JH", had become a strong maternal  figure  for
         the applicant. It is noteworthy that  when  interacting  with  such
         volunteers, the applicant would project familial  relationships  on
         to those who could  not  be  seen  as  Article  8  family  members,
         particularly in respect of a matriarchal relationship. JH refers in
         correspondence at page E6, AB to a relationship akin  to  a  mother
         and son; and a running theme of how much the applicant  missed  his
         mother in Afghanistan and a teacher at the college referred to  his
         only wish being to wanting to find his mother. JH stated:

         "My relationship with [the applicant] became  one  more  synonymous
         with mother/son. He shared with me his journey to the  UK  and  how
         difficult it was, in particular the treatment towards  him  by  the
         agent responsible for bringing him here.... There were a couple  of
         running themes with [the applicant] - how much she missed his  mum,
         if he ever met the agent that brought him to the UK he  would  kill
         him because of what he had done to  [the  applicant]  and  that  he
         wanted to kill himself."

     72) A second volunteer worker,  'PP',  referred  to  being  a  maternal
         figure  and  the  applicant  calling  her  "mum".  Whilst  Ms  Naik
         suggested that references to "mum" might be explicable  because  of
         cultural respect (although we were not directed  to  such  evidence
         that supports such a cultural context), what in fact is clear is  a
         pattern of the applicant projecting onto others forms  of  maternal
         relationships, where Article 8 family relationships plainly do  not
         exist. We  note  that  there  is  no  evidence  before  us  of  the
         relationship between DD's wife  and  the  applicant,  despite  them
         living in the same house for a  number  of  months.  We  accept  Ms
         Naik's submission that the closeness of  these  relationships  with
         volunteers does not detract in any way from  whatever  relationship
         the applicant might have with  DD.  However,  just  as  it  is  not
         asserted, nor could it be  said,  that  the  applicant  has  family
         relationships with the volunteers who met the applicant on a weekly
         basis, there is a sense in which the  applicant  was  projecting  a
         desired dependency on others, when it was clearly not reciprocated.
         The example is of the applicant travelling across the world to stay
         with DD, who at least initially disclaimed any  responsibility  and
         when accepted, was limited in its scope.

     73) Whilst DD refers in his witness statement to the contact  from  the
         respondent, while awaiting the progress of  his  protection  claim,
         there is equally no evidence or suggestion that DD  himself  chased
         for  any  progress,  or  assumed  any  form  of   guardianship   or
         representation. He would have been  aware  of  the  process  of  an
         asylum appeal and there is limited evidence of his  involvement  in
         it when, given the applicant's young  age,  that  might  have  been
         expected. While DD did  attend  on  the  first  occasion  when  the
         applicant was  examined  by  a  psychiatrist,  Dr  Belea,  on  21st
         February 2017, he did not on the second occasion. We  do,  however,
         note that DD attempted to  assist  in  preventing  the  applicant's
         removal by visiting him on two occasions at Brook House  IRC  prior
         to the applicant's removal; in seeking to instruct  solicitors  and
         indeed he visited Germany once, for an  unspecified  period,  after
         the applicant was removed to Germany, but  the  sole  reference  to
         contact after the applicant's removal was telephone  calls  between
         the two for the first two or three months after April  2017,  after
         the applicant was removed to Germany,  and  by  the  time  of  DD's
         witness statement in December 2017, it is unclear how  often  there
         was telephone contact.

     74) The assessment dated 7th December 2017 made by the German  Children
         and  Youth  Services,  Gera  who  were  appointed  the  applicant's
         Guardian, refers to the applicant's acutely unstable  mental  state
         and in the assessment of the German doctors, it being of  paramount
         importance for the applicant to be allowed to  live  together  with
         DD. The report continues (page E40, AB):

         "He often emphasises that he appreciates what is being done for him
         in Germany, but at the same time, it causes him  a  great  deal  of
         suffering to have to live in separation from his uncle, who is  his
         last remaining relative and who acted as his reference person  [our
         emphasis] when [the applicant] lived in England.... As reported  by
         [the applicant] the worries around not being able to live with  his
         uncle are consuming his thoughts every single day... He  is  having
         nightmares and misses his remaining relatives, which is causing him
         suffering.... In the United Kingdom as [the applicant]  reports  he
         was allowed to meet people in whom he confided. Thanks to  this  he
         felt mentally better and able to concentrate on other things rather
         than his trauma and fears[pic]

     75) Considering all of the facts in the round, on the one hand,  up  to
         his arrival in the UK, the relationship between the  applicant  and
         DD would have been very remote, to the extent that DD  was  unaware
         that he was the intended destination. DD initially did  not  accept
         responsibility for  the  applicant  although  he  was  subsequently
         willing to accommodate the applicant and indeed lived with him  for
         a not insignificant period, namely ten and a half months. Moreover,
         following  discussions  between  DD  and  the  applicant's   family
         including his mother in Afghanistan in late September  2016  (which
         does not sit easily with the applicant being unable to contact  his
         mother after leaving Afghanistan in 2015, as reported by  Dr  Belea
         at page E3, AB) DD arranged for  an  English  language  course  and
         provided support in registering the applicant with his GP.  Support
         was also provided through the volunteering  networks  to  which  we
         have already referred. However, as we have also  already  recorded,
         DD's relationship with his nephew appears to be remote. This  could
         well be a function of the applicant's undoubted vulnerability,  but
         beyond accommodating the applicant during the period prior  to  the
         applicant's removal on 11th April 2017, all of the evidence  points
         against there being any meaningful emotional  relationship  between
         the applicant and DD. The  letter  from  Gera  Children  and  Youth
         Services also refers to the relationships the applicant has  formed
         with those in whom he confides, which is reflected in  the  letters
         from the volunteers. Indeed the correspondence from  third  parties
         refer to the applicant continually referring to his wish to  be  in
         contact with his mother with whom it appears he was not in  contact
         or had only indirect contact, whereas DD had met her. There appears
         to be a real disconnect between the quality of  the  communications
         between the applicant and DD, as it appears that the applicant  was
         not even aware that DD had met the applicant's mother in late 2016.

     76) In terms of those with whom the applicant was  able  to  speak  and
         open up with in the UK, the German Guardian report does not  record
         this as relating to DD, and it is more consistent as  referring  to
         his close relations with volunteers and  also  with  Dr  Belea.  In
         other words, the applicant has  benefited  from  the  support  from
         volunteers which he has found critical to  improving  mentally,  as
         opposed to his UK relatives.

     77)  While  there  is  no  requirement  for  dependency  to  be  of   a
         particularly serious or exceptional level, or even for there to  be
         dependency at all, we conclude that there is an absence of evidence
         of  real,  committed  or  effective  support  between  DD  and  the
         applicant prior to his removal on 11th April 2017. DD  accommodated
         the applicant; he accompanied  him  to  a  local  GP  surgery;  and
         following discussions with the applicant's mother  in  Afghanistan,
         (with  whom  the  applicant  claimed  to  have  lost  contact   or,
         alternatively, had only indirect contact), registered  him  with  a
         local English-language school and finally attempted to arrange  for
         legal assistance. The applicant's projection of dependency was  not
         limited to DD, but extended to a wider group of volunteers  in  the
         UK. The projection of dependency,  while  entirely  understandable,
         was not  reciprocated  by  an  acceptance  of  real,  effective  or
         committed support by DD. We are also far  from  satisfied  that  we
         have the full picture in terms of the  nature  of  the  discussions
         between DD and the applicant's mother in Afghanistan; nor we do not
         accept that there has been a transfer,  as  asserted,  of  parental
         responsibility from the applicant's mother to  DD.  When  assessing
         the quality of the relations between DD and the applicant, we  must
         consider the wider ongoing relations between the applicant and  his
         continuing family members in Afghanistan and there is a  clear  gap
         in evidence in relation to that.

     78) We therefore concluded the applicant did not, at the relevant  time
         (his removal from the UK), have family life with  DD,  respect  for
         which would engage Article 8 of the ECHR.

    Article 8 damages

     79) We nevertheless needed to consider whether in principle  we  should
         award the applicant damages for the conceded  breach  of  right  to
         respect for his private life, including with DD in the UK, as  just
         satisfaction for that breach  or  whether  a  declaration  to  that
         effect was sufficient.

    The applicant's submissions

     80) In initial written submissions, the applicant asserted that damages
         were  necessary  for  just  satisfaction  on  the  basis  that  the
         declaration was not sufficient. The breach was not only in  respect
         of his removal, but the  manner  of  his  removal  (which  Ms  Naik
         confirmed was not included in a separate false  imprisonment  claim
         being pursued in the County Court), as set out in  the  applicant's
         witness statement,  in  particular  the  effect  of  handcuffs  and
         restraints on a flight to Germany, when he was  a  child;  and  the
         delay in the respondent facilitating  his  return.  The  respondent
         relied on an  'obviously'  flawed  age  assessment;  ignored  fresh
         evidence (specifically a Taskera) that the applicant  was  a  child
         for almost a year; ignored repeated  requests  to  assess  evidence
         including whilst he was in detention;  summarily  and  irrationally
         rejected that evidence; breached her own policy by  preventing  him
         from challenging his removal and tried to prevent him from bringing
         a claim in the UK by first insisting that he  had  to  contact  the
         German authorities. The medical evidence supported the  applicant's
         vulnerability and his heavy reliance on DD. There was no  challenge
         on causation and there was a sufficiently serious breach to make an
         award of damages appropriate.

     81) In relation to Article 8 damages, the  applicant  referred  to  the
         comparable authorities where awards had been made  of  Kaushal  and
         Others v. Bulgaria, no. 1537/08;  Gapaev  and  Others  v.  Bulgaria
         (41887/09); Guliyev and Sheina v. Russia (App no. 29790/14);  Zezev
         v.  Russia  (application   no.   47781/10).   The   applicant   was
         particularly vulnerable as an  asylum  seeker,  was  a  child,  had
         suffered from trauma and had been entitled to consideration of  his
         asylum claim in the UK. We were also  referred  to  the  unreported
         judgment of the Family Court in Medway Council v M and  T  (by  her
         Children's Guardian) (Case No: ME15C00859), which included a  table
         of cases where Article 8 damages had been awarded.

     82) The correct approach to damages was as set out in DSD  and  Anor  v
         Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [2014] EWHC 2493  (QB)  at
         �[18]:

         "18. In relation to any claim for  an  award  of  compensation  the
         starting point for the analysis is to answer the question whether a
         non-financial remedy is necessary for "just satisfaction"?  In  the
         present case I have already made declarations  in  favour  of  each
         Claimant to the effect  that  their  Convention  rights  have  been
         violated:  Liability  Judgment  paragraphs  [298]  and  [313].  The
         importance of declaratory relief in an appropriate case is  not  to
         be underestimated. It provides a formal, reasoned, vindication of a
         person's legal rights and an acknowledgment in a public forum  that
         they have been wronged. It is an integral part  of  the  democratic
         process whereby a public body can be called to  account.  Case  law
         suggests that there are (at least) two components to  the  question
         whether a financial award should supplement a  declaration.  First,
         it is necessary to consider whether there is a causal link  between
         the breach and the harm which should appropriately be reflected  in
         an award of compensation in addition to  a  declaration?  Secondly,
         and regardless of the answer to the first question, it is necessary
         to consider whether the violation is of  a  type  which  should  be
         reflected in a pecuniary award?"

     83) This Tribunal had evidence of the impact of  removal  from  witness
         statements and uncontested medical evidence. This was  in  contrast
         to the case of Lazoriva v Ukraine - (application no: 6878/14) where
         the limit of a remedy to a declaration was  in  the  context  of  a
         purely  procedural  breach.  There  had  been  no  attempt  by  the
         respondent to recognise or engage with the seriousness of what  had
         happened. The seriousness of the respondent's actions was not  only
         in relation to the applicant's removal but a catalogue of errors in
         failing to acknowledge  and  review  the  Taskera  which  had  been
         provided and treating him as an adult  unless  other  evidence  was
         provided, as recorded in the GCID notes;  the  recording  that  the
         applicant had no family in the UK (page D34, AB) while later in the
         record, there were notes suggesting that the applicant  was  living
         in accommodation paid for by DD (page D38, AB). The  applicant  had
         been detained  and  his  protection  claim  was  certified  without
         evaluation of his Taskera and even when it was  evaluated,  it  was
         merely  rejected  on  the  basis  that  there  were  no  comparable
         documents with which to assess it.

     84) Following the applicant's unlawful removal there was  frequent  and
         extensive pre-action correspondence,  as  a  result  of  which  the
         respondent not only attempted  to  resist  any  assistance  to  the
         applicant but positively sought to persuade the German  authorities
         that the applicant was an adult.

     85) Finally, there was no presumption under  section  8  of  the  Human
         Rights Act that damages should not be awarded. Section 8  specified
         a requirement to consider whether a financial award was necessary.

    The respondent's submissions

     86) Section 8(3) of the Human Rights Act  1998  provided  the  starting
         point that there should be no damages at all  unless,  taking  into
         account other available remedies, this Tribunal is  satisfied  that
         an award is necessary  to  afford  just  satisfaction.  Noting  the
         authority of R (Greenfield) v SSHD [2005]  1  WLR  673,  the  court
         stressed that the remedy of damages played a less prominent role in
         actions for breaches of the ECHR than for private law  obligations,
         where in the latter case often the only  remedy  was  damages.  The
         declaration had been sufficient in the authority of  Lazoriva.  The
         applicant had secured his return from Germany and had  remained  in
         the UK ever since.

     87) The  applicant's  case  was  weaker  than  in  Lazoriva  given  the
         precariousness of the applicant's living arrangements with DD  from
         the outset, having entered the UK illegally. In any event, transfer
         of the applicant to Germany did not affect the applicant's  ability
         to remain in contact with DD and indeed  DD  had  on  one  occasion
         visited the applicant. The assertion that the applicant was heavily
         reliant on DD when they were living together was not borne  out  in
         the evidence.

    Discussion and conclusions - Article 8 damages

     88) We take as our starting point section 8 of  the  Human  Rights  Act
         1998:

         "(1) In relation to any act (or proposed act) of a public authority
         which the court finds is (or would be) unlawful, it may grant  such
         relief or remedy, or make such  order,  within  its  powers  as  it
         considers just and appropriate.

         (2) But damages may be awarded only by a court which has  power  to
         award damages, or to order the payment of  compensation,  in  civil
         proceedings.

         (3) No award of damages is to be made unless, taking account of all
         the circumstances of the case, including -

             (a) any other relief or remedy  granted,  or  order  made,  in
             relation to the act in question (by that or any other  court),
             and

             (b) the consequences of any decision (of  that  or  any  other
             court) in respect of that act,

         the court is satisfied that the award is necessary to  afford  just
         satisfaction to the person in whose favour it is made."

     89) We accept the respondent's  submission  that  a  declaration  would
         ordinarily be sufficient as a remedy, unless an award is  necessary
         in addition. We have considered the loss  or  harm  caused  to  the
         applicant by his removal and the manner of that  removal.  In  that
         context, the respondent must take the applicant as she  finds  him,
         in the sense that she was removing a minor, with significant mental
         health difficulties and vulnerabilities.  Dealing  first  with  the
         fact of removal and its impact, the first impact was  the  harm  to
         the relationship between the applicant and DD, which the  applicant
         had begun to develop while cohabiting with him. However, as we have
         already recorded, and as DD accepts,  there  had  been  significant
         difficulties in establishing a strong relationship between the two;
         and we think it unlikely  that  there  was  a  particularly  strong
         relationship, albeit that the applicant missed DD as  part  of  his
         private life. The applicant  missed  DD  just  as  he  missed  (and
         contacted) a volunteer, PH after his removal,  between  August  and
         September 2017, indicating that what she had written  to  him  made
         him  felt  strong  and  saying  that  he  missed  her  and  another
         volunteer, JH; his teacher; and DD (page E35, AB). The reports from
         the German Guardian and  social  workers  refer  to  this,  missing
         "remaining relatives" (although no express  reference  to  DD)  and
         grappling with suicidal thoughts, although these have now  settled.
         The report continues that DD has the interpersonal skills  to  care
         and offer him a "bit of a family" (page E42, AB). A separate report
         while the applicant was in Germany recorded his suicide attempt  in
         the UK (in 2016,  while  living  with  DD),  but  referred  to  the
         importance that that the applicant placed in his later  attainments
         in  English  language  proficiency  (page  E47,  AB),   and   which
         presumably helped his mental health. When in Germany, the applicant
         was now having to start back at square one, and was scared that  on
         becoming an  adult,  he  would  be  deported  to  Afghanistan.  The
         assessment was that it would be "better for his  mental  health  to
         live together with his uncle." It describes suicidal  thoughts  and
         flashbacks, and that the applicant  appears  happier  when  talking
         about England and his uncle and "talks most of all about his friend
         [JH]. He is closely and constantly in touch with her. She  is  very
         important to him and he wants to see her again at all costs."

     90) At page E51, AB, the report continues:

         "What is the most important for [the applicant] is to be able to be
         back with his uncle in England and to make a living  together  with
         him. He is only "physically" in Germany but everyday his heart  and
         his head are with his family in England. Here at our facility  [the
         applicant] feels trapped and is unable to  lead  a  carefree  life.
         Thoughts about his uncle in England are bothering him  on  a  daily
         basis and he is suffering incredibly because of this. He is finding
         it  difficult  to  concentrate  on  things,  as  his  thoughts  are
         constantly revolving around the one thing. The separation from  his
         uncle has affected his  life  all  round  and  it  has  limited  it
         immensely. "

     91) What is reflected in the German report is the profound effect  that
         the applicant's separation from his support network in the  UK  had
         on him and the distress that this had caused, which meant  that  he
         had only a limited life in Germany. However, there is  no  evidence
         the removal had a long-lasting effect on  the  applicant's  already
         significant mental health issues. There is no evidence of any long-
         lasting, wider impact  on  the  applicant's  private  life  and  in
         particular his close friendship and support with his friend,  'JH',
         about whom he spoke most of all.

     92) We considered not only the type of loss or effect on the applicant,
         which in this case was his obvious distress and sense that  he  was
         living some form of half-life in Germany, but also  the  period  of
         time during which the applicant was separated from his  friendships
         and support network. This was the period from 11th April 2017 until
         his eventual return, following the judgement of Mr Justice  William
         Davis, on 20th December 2018. The period of  absence  is  therefore
         not insignificant. However, a large part of that delay  has  to  be
         seen in the context of the pre-action litigation and the subsequent
         judicial review proceedings.

     93) We set out as an Annex to these reasons a  chronology,  summarising
         the  correspondence  between  the   applicant's   solicitors,   the
         respondent and the German authorities during the  period  from  the
         date of the applicant's  removal  on  11th  April  2017  until  the
         applicant's solicitors issued  these  judicial  review  proceedings
         nearly 9 months later, on 8th January 2018, when the applicant then
         sought expedited relief. Whilst Mr Justice William Davis made clear
         that the respondent ought not to have relied upon an age assessment
         which he regarded as flawed, there was a notable lack of urgency on
         the part of those representing the applicant to seek enforcement of
         his immediate return.

     94) In the context of a suggestion that the respondent was obstructive,
         one  initial  theme  of  the  correspondence  was  the  applicant's
         solicitors repeatedly seeking disclosure of the Lincolnshire County
         Council age assessment and  respondent's  case  records  (so-called
         'GCID' records). Two points  emerge.  First,  in  response  to  the
         disclosure  requests,  the  respondent  repeatedly   referred   the
         applicant's solicitors to its subject access  request  unit,  which
         the applicant's  solicitors  repeatedly  ignored.  The  applicant's
         solicitors never explained their unwillingness  to  do  so  to  the
         respondent,  only  later  referring,  in  their   judicial   review
         application to  this  Tribunal,  9  months  after  the  applicant's
         removal,  to  the  respondent  'refusing  disclosure'  (which   the
         respondent would clearly  dispute)  'in  reliance  on  the  Subject
         Access Bureau procedure, particularly in  circumstances  where  the
         applicant is overseas and providing  identification  acceptable  to
         the SAB is difficult' (page A12,  AB).  We  do  not  criticise  the
         respondent  for  requiring  the  applicant's  solicitors  to   make
         document requests to a dedicated unit,  nor  have  the  applicant's
         solicitors provided any evidence that the  subject  access  request
         unit was uncooperative or that the process was  difficult.  Indeed,
         the unit can hardly be criticised, when they were  never  contacted
         in this case. The lack of explanation by the applicant's solicitors
         to the respondent of why using the subject access request unit  was
         not appropriate is more indicative of the  applicant's  solicitors,
         regrettably, becoming more entrenched in their position.

     95) A second point is that while the applicant's  solicitors  continued
         to ask for copies of the GCID notes until their last correspondence
         dated 28th December 2017, they stopped asking for  a  copy  of  the
         Lincolnshire County Council age assessment after 21st August  2017,
         after the German local  authority  (Gera)  age  assessment  of  the
         applicant, which was favourable to him. The applicant's solicitors'
         focus  was  clearly  on  the  positive  Gera  local  authority  age
         assessment, rather than challenging  the  conflicting  Lincolnshire
         County Council age assessment.

     96) The consequence of both points is that there emerged a conflict and
         confusion between the authorities responsible for, and processes by
         which, the dispute over the applicant's age, which was the  central
         basis of the applicant's removal, could be resolved. The respondent
         was  informed,  on  17th  August  2017,  that  the  German  central
         authorities (as opposed to the Gera local authority)  continued  to
         regard  the  applicant  as  an  adult,  notwithstanding  the   Gera
         authority's assessment of the applicant as  a  child  on  8th  June
         2017. The German central authorities maintained that the  applicant
         was an adult and had been correctly transferred  back  to  them  as
         late as 4th  December  2017,  when  they  refused  the  applicant's
         solicitors'  request  to  make  a  'take  charge'  request  to  the
         respondent.  The  respondent   was   therefore   faced   with   the
         Lincolnshire County Council assessment, as yet (and  indeed  never)
         challenged; the applicant's assertion of the Gera  local  authority
         assessment to the contrary; and indications, when she checked  with
         the German  central  authorities,  that  they  still  regarded  the
         applicant as an adult. It was  the  fact  that  the  applicant  was
         regarded as an adult by both  the  respondent  and  German  central
         authorities which was key to the process. If he were an adult, that
         would have made him removable under the Dublin III Regulation, with
         certification of the asylum claims on safe  third  country  grounds
         being entirely appropriate.

     97) The lack of progress (and frankly,  sustained  initiative)  by  the
         applicant's solicitors in 2017 can be seen  following  the  initial
         intense period of activity between late April and the  end  of  May
         2017, at the end of which the respondent confirmed that it believed
         the German authorities were in the process of carrying out  an  age
         assessment. While the age assessment was carried out  on  8th  June
         2017, there was no further activity for over two months  until  the
         applicant's solicitors wrote to the respondent on 14th August  2017
         and indeed they did not have any direct contact  at  all  with  the
         applicant, even by telephone, until 21st September 2017, which they
         later asserted was due to  'complications  in  securing  legal  aid
         finding to travel to Germany,' (page C64, AB), although this  fails
         to explain why no telephone contact was possible earlier,  when  DD
         had been able to be in  contact  in  the  three  months  after  the
         applicant's removal in April 2017.

     98) The attempts by the applicant's solicitors to seek assistance  from
         the German authorities from 15th  September  2017  will  have  been
         hampered by their sending  correspondence  to  an  incorrect  email
         address, although it remains unclear why it  took  the  applicant's
         solicitors until 27th November 2017, more  than  two  months  later
         (perhaps by way  of  a  simple  telephone  call)  to  rectify  this
         mistake.

     99) The applicant's solicitors did then seek to speed up the process in
         January 2018 by seeking urgent consideration of  their  application
         for  judicial   review,   albeit   the   application   for   urgent
         consideration was rejected by this Tribunal on 12th  January  2018,
         and the process of judicial review litigation then took its course,
         for the remainder of 2018.

    100) Indeed it was this delay in  applying  for  judicial  review  which
         formed the basis of the refusal of  the  application  for  judicial
         review on the papers by Upper Tribunal Judge  Keki?  on  6th  April
         2018, albeit later  reversed  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  McWilliam
         following an oral renewal application on  19th  July  2018.  Whilst
         there  was  a  further  delay  as  a  result  of  the  respondent's
         application to file the detailed grounds of defence,  a  lawyer  of
         this Tribunal  accepted  as  adequate  the  reasons  given  by  the
         respondent for needing an extension, namely  a  response  from  the
         German authorities to give the full picture.

    101)  In  summary,  the  gist  of  the  course  of  events  between  the
         applicant's removal on 11th April 2017 and his return  in  December
         2018 was a lack of any challenge to the age assessment;  the  delay
         in applying for judicial review  between  April  2017  and  January
         2018; the delay in liaising with the German central authorities and
         their reaffirmed view of the applicant as an adult; the common view
         of the respondent and  the  German  central  authorities  that  the
         Dublin III process had been applied  correctly;  and  the  apparent
         confusion over the appropriate channel  to  challenge  that  common
         view, with the respondent believing  this  to  be  via  the  German
         authorities; and the German  authorities  believing  the  opposite,
         complicated by the  fact  of  a  Taskera  which  was  not  assessed
         properly. The  procedural  complexities  did  not  make  resolution
         simple and we conclude on balance that  while  the  respondent  has
         been criticised for relying on the Lincolnshire County Council  age
         assessment, the respondent cannot be criticised for not relying  on
         the Gera local authority age assessment, when  the  German  central
         authorities regarded the applicant as an adult.

    102) In these far from straightforward circumstances, while we do not in
         any way condone or justify the applicant's  unlawful  removal,  the
         delay in return reflects the complex process involved in  resolving
         matters.

    103) The final aspect we considered was the manner  of  the  applicant's
         removal. He described at �[86] onwards of his witness statement (at
         page E69, AB) having handcuffs put on him and being pulled  onto  a
         plane like an animal; he had his trousers pulled off and still  had
         scarring from deep, bloody cuts on  his  wrists  from  the  use  of
         handcuffs. We do not take this element of his claim at its highest.
         While he referred at �[54] of the judicial  review  application  to
         injuries sustained to his leg and arm, we  take  into  account  the
         absence of any reference by the German authorities to the  scarring
         or ill-treatment in  their  subsequent,  detailed  social  services
         reports which recounted the applicant's other recollections of ill-
         treatment or unkindness (for example being sworn at by  drivers  as
         he attempted to kill himself whilst in London); we also  take  into
         account the absence of  any  scarring  evidence,  with  which  this
         Tribunal is  very  familiar  and  which  is  frequently  available.
         Instead, the detailed Gera medical assessment notes at:  page  E51,
         AB:

         "On bad days, [the applicant] also mentions leg pains  and  stomach
         aches.... The  doctors  have  been  unable  to  determine  anything
         medically in relation to his leg and  stomach  problems.  They  say
         that these are related to his mental health."

    104) On balance, we are not prepared  to  accept  that  element  of  the
         applicant's account as reliable. Whilst we have no  doubt  that  he
         was highly distressed during the course of his removal, we  do  not
         accept the claim of what amounts to a serious physical assault,  in
         the absence of scarring evidence which was obviously  open  to  the
         applicant, with legal representation, to adduce; and in the context
         of the Gera authority's assessment, which found no  physical  cause
         of any leg pains.

    105) We take into account  the  effect  of  the  declaration  where  the
         applicant has already been returned to the  UK;  the  fact  of  his
         unlawful removal and the  consequential  period  in  which  he  was
         absent  from  the  UK,  in  circumstances  which   were   obviously
         distressing to him but where there was no evidence of  long-lasting
         impact and in circumstances where the delay is explicable, at least
         in part, by the complexity of the procedures to challenge a return,
         in the absence of any challenge to the Lincolnshire County  Council
         age assessment. In these circumstances, we regard a declaration  as
         just satisfaction of the applicant's claim.

    Francovich damages

    The applicant's submissions

    106) In respect of EU damages, the parties accepted that Article  27  of
         the Dublin III Regulation conferred direct  individual  rights  and
         there was a causal link between the loss and damage suffered by the
         applicant and  the  breach  of  his  rights.  Therefore,  the  sole
         question was whether that breach was a sufficiently serious one. In
         that context, both representatives agreed that the factors set  out
         in R v Secretary of State for transport ex  p  Factortame  (No.  5)
         [2000] 1 AC 524 by Lord Clyde. Adopting those criteria, the  breach
         was one of a general and superior principle of community law, of  a
         right to an effective remedy in  the  context  of  the  applicant's
         removal where the applicant was a minor. The right to an  effective
         remedy could not be clearer and  the  respondent  had  provided  no
         explanation  beyond   an   assertion   without   evidence   of   an
         administrative error. The respondent  simply  broke  the  law.  The
         respondent  deliberately  removed  the  applicant  and  refused  to
         facilitate his return and  the  behaviour  was  more  egregious  in
         fighting the matter right to the end.

    The respondent's submissions

    107) Adopting the same criteria  set  out  by  Lord  Clyde,  Article  27
         provided a specific, narrow procedural safeguard in the context  of
         the Dublin III  Regulation  and  related  to  the  applicant  being
         provided an effective remedy, which he had at all times, namely the
         ability to judicially review the age assessment, which he failed to
         utilise. The real failure was that the applicant had not been given
         sufficient time to challenge his  removal  before  it  took  place.
         Article 27(2) did not define what was meant by a reasonable  amount
         of time and the lack of such precision militated against  an  award
         of damages. The suggestion of a deliberate intention of  inadequate
         notice was not sustained and it was reasonable, and indeed natural,
         to infer that there had  been  an  administrative  clerical  error.
         There was no relevant judgment  on  the  question  of  what  was  a
         reasonable period within Article 27(2) and after it became  evident
         that the infringement had occurred, i.e. after the judgment  of  Mr
         Justice William Davis, the applicant was promptly returned  to  the
         UK. In terms of the effect on the applicant, he continued  to  have
         access, albeit not in the same way, to his friends and DD while  in
         Germany. There was no other EU guidance which  the  respondent  had
         breached. In summary,  the  breach,  while  acknowledged,  was  not
         sufficiently serious to meet the relatively high threshold  for  an
         award of Francovich damages.

    The Law

    108) R v Secretary of State for transport ex p Factortame (No. 5) [2000]
         1 AC 524 provides the following guidance at page 538, paragraph C:

         "Liability to compensate - the principle

         My Lords in the Francovich case [1995] I.C.R. 722, 772,  para.  37,
         where there had been  a  failure  to  implement  a  directive,  the
         European Court said: "it is a principle of Community law  that  the
         member states are obliged to make good loss and  damage  caused  to
         individuals by breaches of Community law for which they can be held
         responsible." The court did not indicate what were  the  conditions
         for such liability or what if any defences would be available to  a
         member state in breach of Community law obligations, save  that  in
         the case of a directive liability was conditional on there being  a
         grant of rights to individuals by the directive, that the  contents
         of those rights were clear, and that the loss suffered was shown to
         be caused by the state's breach. The further scope  of  the  remedy
         was left to be worked out in subsequent cases as  it  has  been  in
         Factortame III""

    109) Paragraph G continues:

         "The basic approach is clear. Before a member  state  can  be  held
         liable, a national court must find (i) that the  relevant  rule  of
         Community law  is  one  which  is  intended  to  confer  rights  on
         individuals; (ii) the breach must be  sufficiently  serious;  (iii)
         there must be a direct causal link between the breach and the  loss
         or damage complained of....."

    110) At page 554, paragraph E provides additional guidance:

         "1. In paragraph 38 of its judgment in Factortame III, at  p.  497,
         the court has affirmed that the liability of  a  member  state  for
         damages for a breach of Community law depends on the nature of  the
         breach. This gives rise  to  consideration  of  a  number  of  more
         particular matters, one of the  most  prominent  of  which  is  the
         importance of the principle which has been breached. Thus in Mulder
         v. Council and Commission of the European Communities (Joined Cases
         C-104/89 and C-37/90) [1992] E.C.R. I-3061 the court  founded  upon
         the fact that the breach in question was of a general and  superior
         principle of Community law, namely  the  protection  of  legitimate
         expectations.

      2. Another consideration relating to the nature of the breach  is  the
         clarity and precision of the rule breached. If the breach is  of  a
         provision of Community law which is not framed  in  clear  language
         and is readily open to construction, then the  breach  may  be  the
         less serious. Questions of the clarity of the rule may  require  to
         be associated with questions  of  the  complexity  of  the  factual
         situation. The application to complex facts even of a rule which is
         reasonably clear in itself may render the situation open to doubt.

      3. Closely related  to  that  last  consideration  is  the  degree  of
         excusability of an error of law. (That could arise  on  account  of
         the ambiguity of a Community text. It could also arise out  of  the
         uncertainty of the law in some  particular  area,  where  there  is
         little or no guidance and evident room for difference of opinion.

      4. Another factor relating to the clarity of the law is the  existence
         of any relevant judgment of the on the point. If there  is  settled
         case law, the failure to follow it may add to  the  seriousness  of
         the breach. On the other hand if the point  is  novel  and  is  not
         covered by any guidance from the then liability should less readily
         follow.

      5. It is also relevant to look at the state of mind of the  infringer,
         and in particular whether the infringer was acting intentionally or
         involuntarily. A deliberate intention to infringe  would  obviously
         weigh heavily in the scales of seriousness. An  inadvertent  breach
         might be relatively less serious on  that  account.  Liability  may
         still be established without  any  intentional  infringement.  More
         broadly, the purpose of the infringer should be considered. If  the
         purpose was to advance the interests  of  the  Community  a  breach
         committed with that end in view might be seen as less serious  than
         one  committed  with  the  purpose  of  serving   merely   national
         interests.

      6. The behaviour of the infringer after it has become evident that  an
         infringement has occurred may also be of  importance.  At  the  one
         extreme the immediate taking of steps to undo what  has  been  done
         and correct any error which  has  been  committed  may  operate  to
         mitigate the seriousness of the breach.  At  the  other  extreme  a
         persistence in the breach, the retention of measures  or  practices
         which are contrary to Community  law,  especially  where  they  are
         known so to be, will add to the seriousness of what has been  done.
         Indeed, in paragraph 57 of the judgment in Factortame  III,  at  p.
         499, the court stated  that  persistence  in  a  breach  despite  a
         judgment finding an infringement or clear case law  on  the  point,
         "will clearly be sufficiently serious."

      7. Another aspect relates to the persons affected by  the  breach.  In
         the Mulder case [1992] E.C.R. I-3061 the court  also  founded  upon
         the fact that there had been a complete failure to take account  of
         the specific situation of a  defined  economic  group,  namely  the
         producers of milk. The fact that the  exclusion  of  the  producers
         from the allocation of a reference quantity was not foreseeable and
         was beyond the limits of ordinary economic risk made the breach all
         the more obvious (pp. 3132, 3133, paras. 16 - 17).

      8. A further consideration  is  the  position  taken  by  one  of  the
         Community institutions in the matter. It may be  that  one  of  the
         institutions has, to use the language of the court in the  judgment
         in Factortame III  [1996]  QB.  404,  500,  para.  56  "contributed
         towards the omission." In the present context this  is  not  to  be
         seen as bearing upon the third of the  three  necessary  conditions
         for liability which the court has prescribed, namely the  existence
         of a  direct  causal  link  between  the  breach  and  the  damages
         sustained. Here it is a factor relating to the seriousness  of  the
         breach. As phrased in para. 56 it  is  presented  as  a  mitigating
         factor and it is wide enough to include various kinds of actions on
         the part of the institution concerned. But  it  also  includes  the
         giving of information or advice and in that connection  the  factor
         could operate in either direction so far as the seriousness of  the
         breach is concerned. Advice from  the  Commission  that  the  state
         would not be  acting  in  breach  of  Community  law  in  taking  a
         particular step would plainly be a mitigating factor. The  decision
         to persist in a proposed step in the  face  of  warnings  from  the
         Commission that the state would be in breach of Community law in so
         doing would add to the seriousness of the state's action.

         What then remains is the application of the test to  the  facts  of
         the case. In para. 58 at p. 500 of the judgment the  court  records
         that the national courts have the sole  jurisdiction  to  find  the
         facts and to decide how to characterise the breaches  in  question.
         But the court then states that it will be  helpful  to  indicate  a
         number of circumstances which the national courts might  take  into
         account." The first of these appears to be a plain indication  that
         at least the  nationality  condition  was  manifestly  contrary  to
         Community law. But it is still for  the  national  court  alone  to
         determine whether there was a sufficiently serious breach......"

    Discussion and conclusions

    111) Applying the guidance above, we accept the respondent's  submission
         that whilst it expresses  a  general  principle  of  the  right  to
         effective remedy, in practice, Article 27(2) does not  include  any
         specific guidance on how much time should be provided in  order  to
         exercise an effective remedy, because to do so would  infringe  the
         rights of different member States to issue and  comply  with  their
         own guidance. Whilst the respondent breached her own guidance,  the
         Article itself did not have sufficient clarity. We also accept  the
         respondent's  submission  that  there  was  an  ability   for   the
         applicant,  albeit  limited,  given  the  curtailment  of  time  to
         challenge removal, to have applied for an immediate  injunction  to
         prevent his removal;  or  alternatively  to  have  applied  for  an
         emergency order requiring his return, shortly after his removal. DD
         had visited the applicant while  the  applicant  was  in  detention
         prior to his removal; the applicant was legally  represented  prior
         to his removal (DD had instructed, possibly  different,  solicitors
         to apply for bail); and the applicant's removal took place nearly a
         year after Lincolnshire County Council's  age  assessment  on  27th
         April 2016, of  which  the  applicant  was  verbally  informed  the
         following day.

    112) Whilst the fact of removal was deliberate and whilst the respondent
         plainly had the Taskera document and had  failed  to  consider  the
         applicant's claimed age in light  of  it,  the  age  assessment  of
         Lincolnshire County Council had not been challenged legally.  While
         the respondent ought to  have  appreciated  that  the  Lincolnshire
         County Council assessment could not be relied upon,  that  did  not
         mean that she ought to have treated the applicant as a minor, given
         the German central authorities' treatment of the  applicant  as  an
         adult. There was not  a  wilful  disregard  by  the  respondent  or
         intention to remove the applicant, knowing him to be  a  child.  In
         the  circumstances,  we  do  not  accept  that   the   breach   was
         sufficiently serious, even noting that it is  now  known  that  the
         applicant was a child and his best interests were breached  by  his
         removal, so as to engage a right to damages under the  'Francovich'
         principle.

    Aggravated damages

    113) For completeness, having declined to award damages under Article  8
         ECHR or damages under the Francovich principle, we decline to award
         aggravated damages. It would be clearly inappropriate  to  make  an
         aggravated award where we have declined to do so for the underlying
         claims.

    Declaration

    114) We make a declaration that the applicant's  right  to  respect  for
         family  life  under  Article  8  ECHR  was  not  engaged   by   the
         respondent's unlawful actions.

    115) We  make  a  declaration  that  the  respondent's  removal  of  the
         applicant breached his right to respect for his private life  under
         Article 8 of the ECHR and his right under Article 27 of the  Dublin
         III Regulation.

    116) We regard our declarations as just satisfaction of the  applicant's
         claims and decline to award him any damages.

|Date           |Description                                             |
|13th April 2016|The applicant enters the UK.                            |
|27th April 2016|Lincolnshire County Council assesses the applicant as an|
|               |adult and informs him verbally the following day, as a  |
|               |result of which he is transferred to adult              |
|               |accommodation.                                          |
|28th April 2016|The applicant is collected by DD, to live with him.     |
|Late September |DD returns to Afghanistan for 40 days without the       |
|2016           |applicant, returning to the UK in November 2016 (the    |
|               |actual dates are unclear.                               |
|11th April 2017|The applicant is removed from the UK to Germany         |
|26th April 2017|Duncan Lewis writes to the respondent, as a pre-action  |
|               |protocol letter, pointing out the applicant's unlawful  |
|               |removal; that his age was disputed and his mental health|
|               |problems had worsened since his removal to Germany; and |
|               |requiring a response within 14 days. The letter referred|
|               |to Lincolnshire CC's age assessment, which Duncan Lewis |
|               |had not seen, but provided a further copy of the        |
|               |Taskera, previously sent to the respondent and asserted |
|               |that the applicant had not had the opportunity to       |
|               |challenge the age assessment. Duncan Lewis sought the   |
|               |applicant's return as a matter of urgency and a copy of |
|               |the age assessment.                                     |
|3rd May 2017   |The respondent sends a holding response, proposing a    |
|               |reply by 10th May 2017.                                 |
|10th May 2017  |The respondent sends a further holding response, pending|
|               |further enquiries. The respondent proposes a new        |
|               |response date of 24th May 2017.                         |
|11th May 2017  |Duncan Lewis writes to the respondent, disputing the    |
|               |need for further enquiries, requesting immediate        |
|               |confirmation of the applicant's return, and copies of   |
|               |the age assessment, GCID notes relating to the          |
|               |applicant's detention and removal; and documents        |
|               |relating to the German authorities' initial refusal of  |
|               |the respondent's 'take back' request under the Dublin   |
|               |III Regulation.                                         |
|19th May 2017  |Duncan Lewis writes to the respondent, asserting that   |
|               |while no formal age assessment has been carried out by  |
|               |the German authorities, they accepted him as a minor;   |
|               |and seeking the applicant's return, together with       |
|               |relevant documentation and consideration of his Taskera,|
|               |by 24th May 2017, failing which the applicant would be  |
|               |advised to pursue remedies in the Upper Tribunal.       |
|23rd May 2017  |The respondent writes to Duncan Lewis setting out the   |
|               |events from her perspective; indicating that the German |
|               |authorities regarded the applicant as making no claim   |
|               |nor offering any evidence that he was a minor, since    |
|               |returning to Germany; disputing the Taskera as reliable |
|               |evidence of the applicant's age; pointing out the option|
|               |of an out-of-country right of appeal against the refusal|
|               |of the asylum claim; and, in response to the requests   |
|               |for evidence, requesting that the request be made to its|
|               |subject access request team.                            |
|31st May 2017  |The respondent writes to Duncan Lewis, confirming that  |
|               |it now understands that the German authorities are      |
|               |carrying out a formal age assessment and it would not be|
|               |appropriate to anticipate the outcome of that           |
|               |assessment.                                             |
|8th June 2017  |The German local authorities (Gera) accept the applicant|
|               |as a child, following an interview with him on 2nd June |
|               |2017.                                                   |
|14th August    |Duncan Lewis writes to the respondent, providing a copy |
|2017           |of the applicant's German identity card confirming his  |
|               |age as a minor and referring to the detrimental effect  |
|               |on health and his mental health treatment in Germany.   |
|               |Duncan Lewis reiterates their request for his return and|
|               |provision of the previously requested documents by 29th |
|               |August 2017.                                            |
|21st August    |Duncan Lewis writes to the respondent, enclosing the    |
|2017           |German identity document. They seek the GCID notes, but |
|               |no longer seek the Lincolnshire Count Council age       |
|               |assessment documents.                                   |
|21st August    |The respondent writes to Duncan Lewis, providing a      |
|2017           |substantive response; disputing that the German         |
|               |authorities had accepted claimed age; if they later did |
|               |so, asserting that it would be for the German           |
|               |authorities to issue a 'take charge' request; and       |
|               |directing the document requests to be made to the       |
|               |respondent's subject access request unit.               |
|25th August    |The respondent writes to Duncan Lewis, acknowledging    |
|2017           |receipt of the photocopy of the German ID card, but not |
|               |accepting the photocopy as it could not be verified; and|
|               |being contrary to the information provided to the       |
|               |respondent by the German central authorities on 17th    |
|               |August 2017, as to the applicant's accepted age. The    |
|               |respondent once again directs that any document requests|
|               |be sent to its subject access request unit.             |
|15th September |Duncan Lewis writes to the German central authorities,  |
|2017           |using an incorrect email address, requesting their      |
|               |assistance to make a 'take charge' request. They refer  |
|               |to his poor treatment during the transfer, for the first|
|               |time.                                                   |
|22nd September |Duncan Lewis writes to the respondent, asking them to   |
|2017           |liaise with the German authorities to verify the German |
|               |ID document; confirming that they have written to the   |
|               |German authorities, asking them to make a 'take charge' |
|               |request and are awaiting a response, which will provide |
|               |the respondent with the opportunity to verify the ID    |
|               |document; asserting that the respondent's failure to    |
|               |disclose documents requested amounts to a breach of her |
|               |duty of candour, and saying that Duncan Lewis is in the |
|               |'process of making a request' to the respondent's       |
|               |subject access request unit. The letter requires a      |
|               |response by 29th September 2017.                        |
|27th September |The respondent writes to Duncan Lewis, asserting that it|
|2017           |is the applicant's obligation to provide original,      |
|               |verifiable ID document, rather than there being an onus |
|               |on the respondent to liaise with the German authorities.|
|               |The respondent notes that it remains open to the German |
|               |authorities, having previously accepted the applicant as|
|               |an adult, to then make a 'take charge' request, should  |
|               |they now regard him as a minor. The respondent disputes |
|               |failing to disclose documents; rather it had asked for  |
|               |any document request to be made to its subject access   |
|               |request unit.                                           |
|15th October   |Duncan Lewis writes again to the German central         |
|2017           |authorities, using an incorrect email address,          |
|               |reiterating their request for a 'take charge' request.  |
|               |They refer to contact with the applicant's German       |
|               |Guardian on 23rd August 2017, introducing themselves and|
|               |providing details obtained of the applicant's mental    |
|               |health. The letter refers to the only direct contact    |
|               |with the applicant being on 21st September 2017 by      |
|               |telephone.                                              |
|24th October   |Duncan Lewis writes to the respondent, enclosing the    |
|2017           |documentation received from the applicant's German      |
|               |Guardian and asking them to verify the applicant's age; |
|               |and referring to the lack of disclosure by the          |
|               |respondent; and requiring a response by 31st October    |
|               |2017.                                                   |
|1st November   |The respondent writes to Duncan Lewis, disputing the    |
|2017           |lack of disclosure and referring to the subject access  |
|               |request process; noting that the German ID pre-dates the|
|               |German central authority's confirmation of a different  |
|               |date of birth; and relies on the availability of the    |
|               |German authorities to be able to make a 'take charge'   |
|               |request.                                                |
|27th November  |Duncan Lewis chase the German central authorities.      |
|and 3rd        |                                                        |
|December 2017  |                                                        |
|4th December   |The German central authorities write to Duncan Lewis,   |
|2017           |pointing out they have been writing to the wrong email  |
|               |address; and declining to issue a 'take charge' request |
|               |on the basis that the applicant was transferred to them |
|               |as an adult and should be treated as an adult, and if   |
|               |the transfer is unlawful, it should be raised with the  |
|               |UK authorities.                                         |
|28th December  |Duncan Lewis writes to the respondent, enclosing        |
|2017           |substantial documentation and asserting that the burden |
|               |should not be on the German central authorities and that|
|               |the respondent remains under a duty to investigate the  |
|               |applicant's age, if not satisfied that he is a minor;   |
|               |the letter again refers to the respondent's failure to  |
|               |disclose documents; and requires the respondent to make |
|               |a 'take charge' request.                                |
|8th January    |The respondent writes to Duncan Lewis, in similar terms |
|2018           |to its letter dated 1st November 2017.                  |
|10th January   |The applicant issues his judicial review application,   |
|2018           |seeking an extension of time, partly on the basis that  |
|               |the German authorities only refused to issue a 'take    |
|               |charge' request on 4th December 2018; and citing lack of|
|               |disclosure and not utilising (or suggesting a 'refusal')|
|               |by the respondent on the basis of the subject access    |
|               |request unit because it is slow and cumbersome and      |
|               |difficult to access from overseas. The application seeks|
|               |interim relief within '48 days'. That application is    |
|               |later initially refused.                                |





                                                                      UTIJR6

(1)  The Tribunal makes a declaration that  the  applicant  has  a  date  of
      birth of 18 January 2000.

Case management directions

   2) Within 14  days  of  these  directions  being  sent  to  the  parties'
      representatives, in light of the  Tribunal's  declaration  as  to  the
      applicant's date of birth, the respondent is directed  to  confirm  to
      the Tribunal and the applicant's representatives whether  she  accepts
      or disputes that the applicant has a family life with  his  uncle,  to
      the extent that respect for which is capable of engaging article 8  of
      the European Convention on Human Rights ('ECHR').

   3) Within 14  days  of  these  directions  being  sent  to  the  parties'
      representatives, in  light  of  the  Court  of  Appeal's  decision  in
      Secretary of State for the Home Department v R (on the application  of
      FTH), [2020] EWCA Civ 494, the respondent is directed  to  confirm  to
      the Tribunal and the applicant's representatives whether she maintains
      or seeks to withdraw her previous concession that her decisions, which
      were  determined  as  unlawful  by  William  Davis  J,  breached   the
      applicant's rights to respect for his private life, for  the  purposes
      of article 8 of the ECHR.

   4) Within 28  days  of  these  directions  being  sent  to  the  parties'
      representatives, and provided that the respondent  has  complied  with
      the  directions  set  out  in  (2)  and  (3)  above,  the  applicant's
      representatives are directed  to  confirm  to  the  Tribunal  and  the
      respondent's representatives:

        a. in the event that the respondent seeks to withdraw the  previous
           concession, whether she objects to such a withdrawal and if  she
           does, the basis of such an objection;


        b. whether the applicant continues to pursue a claim for damages on
           the basis of a breach of article 8 of the ECHR, both in  respect
           for his family and private life.


   5)  Following  receipt  of  the  parties'  submissions  in  response   to
      directions (2) to (4), the Tribunal has reached the  provisional  view
      that it would, in this case, be appropriate to determine the following
      questions without a hearing:

        a.  whether  the  respondent's  impugned   actions   breached   the
           applicant's rights to respect for his family  and  private  life
           under article 8 of the ECHR;


        b. whether the applicant should be able to recover damages for  any
           breach of article 8 of the ECHR (as opposed  to  the  amount  of
           such damages).


   6) Any party who  considers  that  despite  the  foregoing  directions  a
      hearing is necessary to consider the questions set  out  in  paragraph
      (5) (or either of them) above may submit reasons  for  that  view  and
      they will be taken into account by the Tribunal if received  no  later
      than 42 days after  this  notice  is  sent  out.   The  directions  in
      paragraphs (2) to (5) above must be complied with in every case.

   7) The Tribunal proposes to list a hearing for any  remaining  issues  on
      the quantum of damages, including as a result of breach of the  Dublin
      III regulations, via Skype for Business, for one  day  in  the  period
      between 29 June and 14 August 2020.   The parties' representatives are
      directed to confirm within 14 days of these directions being  sent  to
      the parties:

        a. whether they object to the hearing being conducted by Skype  for
           Business;


        b. if they agree to such a hearing, the email address  and  contact
           details for their representatives to join the hearing via Skype;




        c. any unavailable dates in the listing window.


   8) Documents and submissions filed in response to these directions may be
      sent by, or attached to, an email  to  [email]  using  the  Tribunal's
      reference number (found at the top of these directions) as the subject
      line.  Attachments must  not  exceed  15  MB.   This  address  is  not
      generally available for the filing of documents.

   9) Costs remain reserved.

Reasons

Background

10) The applicant applied on 10 January 2018  for  judicial  review  of  the
respondent's decision to remove  him  from  the  UK;  and  for  the  linked
decisions in which the respondent certified his asylum claim on third party
grounds, and certified his human rights claim as clearly unfounded,  to  be
quashed.

11) In the previous order and judgment of William  Davis  J,  which  is  not
recited in full for the sake of brevity, he granted the  applicant's  claim
for judicial review; declared that the respondent  had  unlawfully  removed
the applicant from the UK without proper notice in breach of her policy and
article 27 of the Dublin III regulations; and ordered that the decisions to
remove the applicant from the UK; to certify the applicant's  asylum  claim
on third country grounds; and to certify the applicant's human rights claim
as clearly unfounded, were quashed. The same orders required the return  of
the applicant from Germany, to which he had been removed, back to the UK.

12) William Davis J did not determine the issue of whether  the  applicant's
removal breached his rights under article 8 of the  ECHR  and  the  resumed
hearing was relisted to consider the applicant's claim  for  damages  on  5
March 2020.

13) In advance the resumed hearing, Tribunal staff wrote  to  both  parties'
representatives on 2 March 2020, in the following terms:

      "In  light  of  a  forthcoming  Presidential  panel  which   will   be
      considering the issue of damages for breach of  Dublin  III  in  other
      separate cases, the Tribunal is considering whether the  determination
      of an award of damages in the above application should  be  linked  to
      that Presidential Panel considering those  other  cases  or  adjourned
      pending the decision in those cases.  The Tribunal  therefore  intends
      that only questions of "Article 8 liability" should be  addressed  and
      considered at the hearing on Thursday.  The  parties'  representatives
      should attend, ready to:


        1) make submissions on the remaining areas of liability in dispute;




        2) to discuss, and if possible, agree, case  management  directions
           for future conduct of the litigation, on the issue of damages."


14) In the respondent's written skeleton argument dated  27  February  2020,
the respondent conceded that the applicant's removal did breach his  rights
to respect for his private life under article 8 ECHR, but asserted that  no
damages  were  required  to  give  just  satisfaction   for   the   breach.
Nevertheless, the respondent continued to dispute that the applicant had  a
family life with his uncle in the UK, capable of engaging article 8,  which
the impugned decisions had breached.

15) At the hearing on 5 March 2020, in identifying the  issues  between  the
parties, it  became  apparent  that  the  respondent  did  not  accept  the
applicant's claimed date of birth; his claim to have been a minor  when  he
entered the UK; and that he was a minor when he began living with his uncle
in the UK from in or around June 2016, prior to being removed to Germany on
1 April 2017. Instead, the respondent referred to evidence which  was  said
to demonstrate a year of birth of 1996, which would mean that the applicant
was an adult when entering the UK and living with his uncle, which in  turn
was one of the grounds for disputing the existence of family  life  between
the two. If such family life did exist, then just as the impugned decisions
had breached the applicant's right to respect for  his  private  life,  the
respondent accepted that they would similarly breach his rights to  respect
for his family life.  We confirmed to the representatives that in assessing
the existence of family life, it  was  necessary  for  us  to  decide  what
assigned date of birth the applicant has.  Lincolnshire County Council  had
previously confirmed on 27 November 2019 that  its  age  assessment  of  27
April 2019 had been withdrawn and the representatives at the hearing before
us had not come prepared to participate with regard to an  age  assessment.
As a result, the hearing on 5  March  2020  was  adjourned  and  we  issued
directions, which included requiring the parties  to  correspond  with  two
local authorities (Lincolnshire CC and Sutton LBC) in whose localities  the
applicant had lived, to establish their position on the applicant's age, in
preparation for a resumed hearing over two days on 22 and  23  April  2020,
the first day of which could deal with an age assessment.

16) Following the outbreak of Covid-19, the resumed  hearing  did  not  take
place and by consent of the parties, instead,  a  case  management  hearing
took place by telephone on 25 March  2020.   The  gist  of  the  directions
issued was that the respondent would write to Sutton LBC, within whose area
the applicant currently lived, to seek their view on the  applicant's  date
of birth; both  parties  were  then  to  confirm  their  positions  on  the
applicant's date of birth; and in the absence of an agreement  between  the
parties, this Tribunal would then reach a decision on the applicant's  date
of birth, without the need for a further hearing, following which a further
case management hearing would then take place.

17) In response to the directions, Sutton LBC indicated that it had no  view
on the applicant's status as a minor, as he was not and  had  not  been  in
their care; and could not form a view, given the passage of  time  and  the
fact that he was now, on any view, an adult.

18) In her submissions dated 15 April 2020,  the  respondent  asserted  that
there was credible and clear documentary evidence that the applicant had an
allocated date of birth of 1996, specifically  Eurodac  records,  when  the
applicant's fingerprints were taken in Greece and Germany, in which he  had
given 1996 as his year of birth.  The earlier date  of  birth  was  further
recorded in NHS records and in a report of a  consultant  psychiatrist,  Dr
Belea, which the respondent said should have more weight  attached  to  it,
together with the other documentary evidence, than a witness  statement  of
the applicant's uncle, which was said to  be  subjective,  as  he  was  not
trained in age assessments; and an assessment carried  out  by  the  German
authorities (Gera City Council), which had assessed the applicant's date of
birth as being in 2000, i.e. as the applicant had  claimed,  on  the  basis
that the respondent could not know the robustness of  Gera  City  Council's
methodology.

19) We are conscious that in assessing the applicant's age, our role is  not
to choose between the ages claimed by the applicant or the respondent.  The
burden is a neutral one and we must  decide  the  applicant's  age  on  the
available evidence, as best we can. The standard of proof is the balance of
probabilities.  While we refer to specific evidence, we have considered  it
all in the round.  Lincolnshire CC have withdrawn their age assessment. The
applicant's uncle provides a categoric statement about having been  present
at the applicant's birth. In that context, we conclude  that  any  lack  of
experience in age assessments is irrelevant, contrary to  the  respondent's
submissions.  In his evidence, the uncle corroborates the prompt disclosure
of the applicant's age when the applicant arrived in the  UK  and  explains
the replication of the earlier claimed date of birth in NHS  sources.   His
account is,  in  turn,  corroborated  in  that  regard  by  Dr  Belea.  The
respondent does not dispute the uncle's  evidence  based  on  his  lack  of
honesty or integrity.

20)  The  impression  given  by   the   respondent   of   multiple   sources
corroborating a year of birth  of  1996,  confuses  references  in  various
sources, with  them  each  containing  an  independent  assessment  of  the
applicant's year of birth.  They in fact draw from the same source,  namely
what the applicant told the German authorities in 2016. Reference  to  1996
as the applicant's year of birth in the NHS records and Dr  Belea's  report
stems from the information originally in the Eurodac records, (as confirmed
in Dr Belea's letter of 7 March 2017, when she  says  that  the  respondent
does not have the correct date of birth and she understands him to  be  17,
at the date of the report; and her supplementary report dated 4 May  2020).
The Eurodac records in turn confirm what  the  applicant  told  the  German
authorities  in  2016.   Other  than  the  withdrawn  age   assessment   by
Lincolnshire CC, the sole evidence pointing  to  the  applicant's  date  of
birth being 1996 is what the applicant himself told the German  authorities
in 2016, which is what he has been seeking to retract ever  since  arriving
in the UK in 2016 and following his removal back to Germany.

21) Reliance on the applicant's self-reported age to the German  authorities
in 2016, as reflected in  the  Eurodac  records,  ignores  the  applicant's
explanation in his witness statements that: if he had revealed that he  was
a minor in 2016 to the German authorities, he would not be able  to  travel
across Europe and would have  been  kept  in  childrens'  accommodation  in
Germany, with serious implications for his family in Afghanistan; and  that
he was threatened by the agent who was trafficking him not  to  reveal  his
true age.  Such reliance also ignores the applicant's prompt  revealing  of
his claimed age when he entered the UK, as confirmed in the uncle's witness
evidence, when the uncle attempted to register the applicant with a GP.

22) The uncle's  witness  evidence  is  corroborated  by,  or  is  at  least
consistent with, evidence from other sources: the Taskera or identification
document for the applicant, the translation of which was  made  on  2  June
2016 and provided to the respondent; and the Gera City  Council  childrens'
services assessment of the applicant as  having  a  date  of  birth  of  18
January 2020. While the respondent raises concerns about the robustness  of
the methodology of the assessment  in  as  much  as  she  states  that  its
robustness is  unknown,  the  report  was  clear  and  transparent  in  its
methodology.  It referred to an interview having been  conducted  with  the
applicant on 2  June  2017,  during  which  the  applicant  repeatedly  and
confidently stated his  date  of  birth  of  2000;  provided  coherent  and
credible descriptions; and described a comprehensible sequence  of  events.
While the interview notes have not been provided, the  description  of  the
methodology does  not  appear  markedly  dissimilar  from  age  assessments
carried out by UK Councils.  The respondent does not seek  to  assert  that
the process by which German age assessments are undertaken cannot be relied
upon in general and offers no substantial or sustainable  critique  of  the
process utilised by them.  In the  circumstances,  we  do  not  accept  the
respondent's proposition that we should attach no weight to the  Gera  City
Council report.

23) Having considered  all  of  the  above  evidence  in  the  round,  which
supports the applicant's allocated date of birth being 18 January 2020, and
the only evidence of an alternative  date  of  birth  being  satisfactorily
explained, we find it more likely than not that  the  applicant's  date  of
birth is 18 January 2000.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  applicant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any member of his family.     Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.



Having considered all documents lodged and having heard Ms  Sonali  Naik  QC
and Mr Greg � Ceallaigh, instructed on behalf of the applicant and Mr  Gwion
Lewis, instructed by the  Government  Legal  Department  on  behalf  of  the
respondent at a hearing at Field House, London on 22nd  and  23rd  September
2020 and upon judgment being handed down  on  5th  November  2020,  and  the
application for  judicial  review  having  previously  been  granted  by  Mr
Justice William Davis in a Judgment dated 4th December 2018




    Declaration

      1) In accordance with the Judgment attached,  we  make  a  declaration
         that the applicant's right to respect for family life under Article
         8 ECHR was not engaged by the respondent's unlawful actions.

      2) We  make  a  declaration  that  the  respondent's  removal  of  the
         applicant breached his right to respect for his private life  under
         Article 8 of the ECHR and his right under Article 27 of the  Dublin
         III Regulation.

      3) We regard our declarations as just satisfaction for the applicant's
         claims and decline to award him any damages.

    Costs

      4) We note the principles set out in M v  London  Borough  of  Croydon
         [2012] EWCA Civ 595.

      5) Mr Justice William Davis had awarded the applicant his costs up  to
         the date of his orders of 4th December 2018, as set out  in  �2  of
         the attached Judgment.  The applicant  continued  his  application,
         seeking a declaration that the respondent's acts,  assessed  by  Mr
         Justice William Davis as in breach of Article 27 of the Dublin  III
         Regulation, also breached his right to respect for his  family  and
         private life, for the purposes  of  Article  8  of  the  ECHR.  The
         applicant  sought  damages  for  those  breaches,  asserting   that
         declarations were not just satisfaction for them.

    The respondent's position

      6) The respondent, in  a  written  skeleton  argument  filed  on  27th
         February 2020, (prior to a hearing before us on  5th  March  2020),
         conceded that the respondent's unlawful removal  of  the  applicant
         had breached his  right  to  respect  for  his  private  life,  but
         asserted that a declaration was just satisfaction; that  his  right
         to respect for his family life was not  breached;  and  no  damages
         were due under EU law (so-called 'Francovich' damages).

      7) While the respondent accepts that she  should  be  liable  for  the
         applicant's reasonable costs up to and including 3rd March 2020, (3
         working days after 27th February 2020, which  was  enough  time  to
         have proposed settlement of the application), the respondent should
         now be awarded her costs after that date, on  the  basis  that  the
         respondent's position on the above issues has been vindicated.  The
         respondent seeks that her liability for the applicant's costs up to
         3rd March 2020 should be set off  against  the  respondent's  costs
         after that date.




    The applicant's position

    (8)  The applicant asserts that he should be awarded his costs up  14th
         May 2020, when we concluded,  as  a  preliminary  issue,  that  the
         applicant was a minor at the time of his removal; and this amounted
         to a significant success as the declaration of breach of article  8
         ECHR in respect of his private life was as a child.  The  applicant
         argues that there should be no order as to costs after  that  date,
         as the respondent repeatedly delayed in complying  with  directions
         (for example in serving a late Acknowledgement of Service) and  had
         succeeded in resisting the transfer  of  this  application  to  the
         County Court, to be considered together with his civil  action  for
         false imprisonment, thereby needlessly duplicating costs.  Any set-
         off of costs would not be appropriate, given that the applicant  is
         publicly funded, with the  implication  of  set-off  of  costs  for
         publicly funded practices.

    Discussion on costs

      9) We accept  the  respondent's  submission  that  the  bases  of  her
         continuing resistance to the application, after her  concession  on
         27th February 2020, have all been in the  respondent's  favour.  In
         that specific sense, the  respondent  has  'succeeded'.  Any  delay
         between the initial order of Mr Justice  William  Davis  dated  4th
         December 2018 and the concession by the respondent of 27th February
         2020 is reflected by the award of the applicant's costs up  to  3rd
         March  2020.   We  do  not  accept  that  our  declaration  of  the
         applicant's date of birth on 14th May 2020 represents  a  'success'
         for the applicant.  The application did not seek  to  challenge  an
         earlier age assessment of the  applicant  (by  Lincolnshire  County
         Council) as an adult, and it was only at  our  initiative,  at  the
         hearing on 5th March 2020, that we  regarded  it  as  necessary  to
         determine the applicant's age, for which  neither  party  had  come
         prepared; both appeared to suggest that it was unnecessary to carry
         out a further age assessment; and having determined that it was, we
         had to adjourn that hearing.   Also,  even  in  light  of  our  age
         assessment, (which the applicant had never sought),  the  applicant
         was unsuccessful in the aspects of  his  application  that  he  had
         continued to pursue.

     10) We do not accept that in this case, any breaches by the  respondent
         in complying with the timescales  for  directions,  and  subsequent
         grants of extensions of time, should prevent  the  respondent  from
         being awarded her costs.  As we noted  at  �100  of  the  Judgment,
         while there were delays and the respondent applied to file detailed
         grounds of defence, the reasons for that  delay  were  accepted  as
         adequate by a Lawyer of this Tribunal in granting the  respondent's
         application.

     11) We also accept that, notwithstanding that the applicant is  legally
         aided, it is appropriate that the respondent's  liability  for  the
         applicant's costs should have set off against  it  the  applicant's
         liability for the respondent's costs, as permitted by the Court  of
         Appeal in R (Burkett) v London Borough of  Hammersmith  and  Fulham
         [2004] EWCA (Civ) 1342, particularly �[67] to  [73]).   We  do  not
         accept  that  ZN  (Afghanistan)  v  SSHD  [2018]  EWCA   Civ   105,
         particularly �[87] to [94], to which the appellant refers, supports
         the proposition that the fact that the applicant is  legally  aided
         is a bar, or material factor, against set-off.

     12) We further do not accept that no order for  costs  should  be  made
         because the respondent had  successfully  resisted  a  transfer  of
         these proceedings to the County Court, to be considered with  other
         proceedings there.   The  proceedings  are  separate,  as  are  the
         issues, which Ms Naik confirmed to us when we  discussed  with  her
         whether there was any overlap, at �80  of  our  Judgment.   It  was
         fortunate that Mr Justice William Davis allowed this application to
         remain in this Tribunal, noting our  later  identification  of  the
         need to carry out an age assessment, and this Tribunal's specialist
         expertise on that issue.

    Decision on costs

     13) The respondent is to pay the applicant's reasonable  costs  of  the
         proceedings up until and including 3rd March 2020.

     14) The applicant is to pay the respondent's reasonable  costs  of  the
         proceedings since 4th March 2020, subject to regulation 16  of  the
         Civil Legal Aid (Costs) Regulations 2013, (as he has the benefit of
         cost protection under section 26 of the Legal Aid,  Sentencing  and
         Punishment of Offenders Act 2012).

     15) These costs are to be subject to detailed assessment if not agreed,
         with the applicant's publicly  funded  costs  subject  to  detailed
         assessment in any event, in accordance with  the  Civil  Legal  Aid
         (Costs) Regulations 2013 and CPR 47.18.

     16) The amount in costs which the applicant is required  to  pay  under
         paragraph (14) above is to be set-off against the  costs  that  the
         respondent must pay under paragraph (13) above, with the respondent
         then to pay the balance to the applicant (if any).

    Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal

    (17) The applicant seeks permission to appeal to the  Court  of  Appeal
         against our Judgment on three grounds:

         a. Ground (1): this asserts that we have erred in  concluding  that
            the applicant's relationship  with  his  uncle,  'DD',  did  not
            engage his rights to respect for family life under article 8  of
            the ECHR.

             i. The ground asserts that we  assessed  the  relationship  as
                though the two were not related, impermissibly  considering
                the authority of Paradiso and Campanelli v Italy (2017)  65
                EHRR 22.  Contrary to the ground, we  did  not  ignore  the
                fact that DD and the applicant were related; rather, as  we
                explained at ��50 and  52,  there  was  not  a  'hard-line'
                between those cases of blood-relatives and other cases, and
                that  a  wider,  careful  scrutiny  of  the  facts  may  be
                necessary.

            ii. We did not, as the grounds assert, base our conclusions  on
                the fact that DD  had  been  unwilling  to  return  to  his
                country of origin to cohabit with his family. We recognised
                that DD had not abandoned his family out  of  choice  (�55)
                and had a genuine fear of persecution. There was,  however,
                no  arguable  error  in  us  considering  DD's  return   to
                Afghanistan after his grant of British citizenship and  his
                stay with his 'own' family (his evidence) rather  than  the
                applicant's (�56).

           iii. We did not arguably err in considering DD's initial lack of
                awareness that the applicant was travelling to be with  him
                or his  willingness  to  support  the  applicant.  We  were
                entitled to consider this in the context of the absence  of
                reciprocity in the relationship between the two (��51;  58;
                and 62 to 64).

            iv. Contrary to  the  grounds  that  we  treated  the  strained
                relationship   between   the   applicant    and    DD    as
                'determinative' when DD took "full responsibility  for  the
                applicant's   care,   accommodation,   health,    financial
                support", we did  not  regard  it  as  'determinative';  we
                considered all of the factors, including their relationship
                prior to cohabitation (�64);  DD's  initial  reaction  when
                asked to help the applicant (�66); DD's assistance  with  a
                GP and  accommodation  (�69);  DD's  help  in  arranging  a
                psychiatrist at �73; college attendance (�70); as  well  as
                the  absence  of  evidence  of  support  while  DD  was  in
                Afghanistan for 40 days (�70) and we  expressly  considered
                all of the facts in the round  (�75).   We  also  expressly
                stated that the applicant's friendships with others did not
                detract from our appraisal  of  his  relationship  with  DD
                (�72). We drew our consideration of all of the  factors  in
                the round together, at �77.

         b. Ground (2): this asserts that we have erred in  finding  that  a
            declaration  was  just  satisfaction  for  the  breach  of   the
            applicant's Article 8 ECHR right  to  respect  for  his  private
            life.

             i.  The  ground  refers  to  us  ignoring  to  the  length  of
                separation between the applicant and DD, as  a  child;  the
                respondent's  repeated   refusal   to   engage   with   the
                applicant's case  over  many  months  and  her  attempt  to
                frustrate his attempts to secure his  return.  Contrary  to
                this ground, we analysed not only the period of separation,
                but  the  reasons  for  the  length  of   that   separation
                (including delay on the part of the applicant's  solicitors
                - ��92 to 93); the effect on the applicant (��89 to 91) and
                whether the respondent was obstructive (�94).

            ii. We considered the issue of the respondent's request that  a
                subject access request  be  made  for  documents,  and  the
                applicant's solicitor's lack of pursuit of this  at  (�94).
                Contrary to the grounds,  the  impossibility  of  complying
                with a specific requirement for a certified photograph,  in
                order to make a subject access request, was  not  drawn  to
                our attention and we did not err in  not  considering  that
                proposition.

           iii. Contrary to the ground that we  erred  in  criticising  the
                applicant's solicitors  for  not  challenging  Lincolnshire
                County Councils' age assessment, we considered  the  reason
                why they did not, after the applicant received  the  German
                local authority assessment which was favourable to  him  at
                �95, but we then explained that the lack of  challenge  had
                consequences, at set out at ��96 to 97.  In  that  context,
                contrary to the assertion that we ignored the  respondent's
                refusal  to  assist,   we   considered   the   respondent's
                interaction  with  the  German  central  authorities,   who
                maintained that the applicant was an adult (�96).

            iv. In summary, we approached the issue  of  whether  to  award
                damages, recognising the period of separation  between  the
                applicant and his friends and DD; we considered  in  detail
                the context of the period of separation and  the  far  from
                straightforward circumstances of this case; the  manner  of
                the applicant's removal; and the effect of the  appellant's
                removal and separation on him, which we  drew  together  at
                �105.  There is no arguable error in our analysis.

         c. Ground (3): this asserts we have erred in our conclusion not  to
            award Francovich damages, in  presuming  that  the  respondent's
            actions were as a  result  of  a  simple  administrative  error,
            without considering evidence to that effect;  and  ignoring  the
            respondent's various  errors,  referred  to  above.  As  already
            noted, we explained fully our analysis of the assertion that the
            respondent refused to engage with  the  German  authorities.  We
            explained why we concluded that the applicant could have applied
            for an immediate injunction to prevent his  removal  (�111)  and
            why we did not  accept  that  the  respondent  had  removed  the
            applicant, knowing him to be a child (�112), in the absence of a
            challenge to the age assessment, about which the  applicant  was
            informed months earlier.

    Decision on permission

    For the above reasons, we do not regard the grounds as  disclosing  any
    arguable error in our  decision.  We  therefore  refuse  permission  to
    appeal to the Court of Appeal.

    Notification of appeal rights


    A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial  review
    is a decision that disposes of proceedings.


    A party may appeal against such a decision to the Court of Appeal on  a
    question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to
    the Upper Tribunal for permission, at the hearing at which the decision
    is given. If no application is  made,  the  Tribunal  must  nonetheless
    consider at the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to  appeal
    (rule 44(4B) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008).




    If  the  Tribunal  refuses  permission,  either  in  response   to   an
    application or by virtue of rule 44(4B),  then  the  party  wishing  to
    appeal can apply for permission from the Court of Appeal  itself.  This
    must be done by filing an applicant's notice  with  the  Civil  Appeals
    Office of the Court of Appeal within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's
    decision on permission  to  appeal  was  sent  (Civil  Procedure  Rules
    Practice Direction 52D 3.3).
