                            DECISION AND REASONS


The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of  Nigeria  born  on  15th  May  1984.   He
    appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated 17th  March  2014
    to refuse his application for further leave to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom and to remove him by way of directions under Section 10 of  the
    Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.  The Appellant's appeal was allowed at
    first instance by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Hunter  sitting  at
    Hatton Cross on 23rd October 2014.  The Respondent appeals  with  leave
    against that decision.  As a consequence  the  matter  came  before  me
    initially as an appeal by the Respondent but as I have for the  reasons
    which I set out below set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    and have remade the decision in this case I shall continue to refer  to
    the parties as they were known  at  first  instance  for  the  sake  of
    convenience.

2.   The Appellant entered the United Kingdom in 2003 as  a  family  visitor
    at the age of 19.  After his visit visa expired  he  remained  in  this
    country and has had no leave to remain  since  then.   The  Appellant's
    sister Ms Kofowrorola  Ogungbayi,  also  a  Nigerian  citizen  born  in
    Nigeria on 6th June 1994 came to the United Kingdom  six  months  after
    the Appellant in July 2003 and she too  has  remained  ever  since.  In
    February 2012 both the Appellant and his sister Ms Ogungbayi  submitted
    applications for leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  In March  2013
    Ms Ogungbayi's application was granted but the Appellant's was refused.
     It was the refusal of the Appellant's application which gave  rise  to
    the present proceedings. The reason  for  the  delay  in  deciding  the
    Appellant's application after  that  of  his  sister  was  because  the
    Respondent made an initial decision on the  Appellant's  case  on  27th
    March 2013 but it was withdrawn and a new decision made on  17th  March
    2014.

3.   The Appellant's case was that whilst  in  the  United  Kingdom  he  had
    obtained A levels before going  to  university  where  he  had  studied
    Chemical Engineering.  He had been unable to obtain a  job  because  of
    his immigration status.  He was supported by his aunt Ms  Kate  Abu,  a
    British citizen who provided accommodation and food. She did  not  give
    evidence at first instance, the Appellant telling the Judge that Ms Abu
    was unable to attend the hearing because she had to go to work.

The Proceedings at First Instance

4.   As the Appellant's application for leave to  remain  was  made  on  1st
    November 2011 that is to say prior to 9th July 2012, Judge Hunter  held
    following the case of Edgehill [2014] EWCA Civ 402 that the Appellant's
    appeal fell to be determined so far as Article 8  was  concerned  under
    the legal position which existed prior to 9th July 2012.

5.   The Judge found both the  Appellant  and  his  sister  to  be  credible
    witnesses.  They came from  a  polygamous  family  in  Nigeria,  having
    limited contact with their father and a mother who had come in and  out
    of their lives.  This had led to both  the  Appellant  and  his  sister
    being looked after by their grandmother for a number  of  years  before
    both the Appellant and his sister travelled to the UK in  2003,  albeit
    at separate times.  Ms Abu had supported the Appellant and  his  sister
    and that they had lived together in the UK since  2003.   The  type  of
    upbringing that the Appellant and his sister had living apart from  one
    parent and for a lengthy period of time both parents  had  brought  the
    relationship between the Appellant and his  sister  closer  than  might
    otherwise have been the case particularly since 2003 when they moved to
    a new country.  Neither the Appellant nor his sister  had  married  and
    they continued to live together at the same address  in  South  London.
    At paragraph 48 the Judge wrote:

         "I  consider  their  relationship  goes  further  than  the  normal
         emotional ties which might exist between adult siblings and amounts
         to an emotional dependency which in my view constitutes family life
         within the meaning of Article 8".

6.   The Judge also accepted that during the twelve years the Appellant  had
    been in the United Kingdom he had  established  a  private  life  which
    would be interfered with by his removal from the United  Kingdom.   The
    Judge  reminded  himself  that  in  assessing  the  proportionality  of
    interference with protected rights he should have regard to the  public
    interest considerations set out at Section  117B  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.   The  maintenance  of   effective
    immigration control was in the public interest and in  this  particular
    case the Appellant was unable to succeed under the  Immigration  Rules.
    The Appellant spoke English and had obtained A levels and a  university
    degree.  He was being  supported  by  Ms  Abu  who  provided  him  with
    accommodation.  The private life established by the  Appellant  in  the
    United Kingdom had  been  largely  at  a  time  when  he  had  been  an
    overstayer.  However at paragraph 55 the Judge said,

         "I consider his relationship with his sister should  be  considered
         differently firstly because of the nature of the  relationship  but
         secondly because of his sister being in the UK was not a matter  of
         her choice she having been brought to the UK when she was  9  years
         of age".

7.    The  Judge  accepted  that  without  family  members  to  support  the
    Appellant it would  be  potentially  difficult  for  him  to  establish
    himself in Nigeria given the length of time he had been in  the  United
    Kingdom notwithstanding the qualification he had obtained whilst  being
    in the UK.  The Respondent had written to  the  Appellant's  sister  Ms
    Ogungbayi stating that she did not consider it would be reasonable  for
    Ms Ogungbayi to leave the United Kingdom.  The Judge found it would  be
    a disproportionate interference with the Appellant's right to a  family
    life under Article 8 if he were to be removed to Nigeria and he allowed
    the appeal.

The Onward Appeal

8.   The Respondent appealed against that decision arguing that the case  of
    Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 and Nagre  [2013]  EWHC  720  meant  that  an
    Article 8 assessment should only be  carried  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules where there were compelling circumstances not recognised  by  the
    Immigration Rules.  The meaning of exceptional  circumstances  was  one
    where refusal would  lead  to  an  unjustifiably  harsh  outcome.   The
    relationship between  adult  siblings  would  not  normally  constitute
    family life unless there were special  elements  of  dependency  beyond
    normal emotional ties.  In this case the Appellant  was  an  adult  and
    whilst he and his sister may have lived together there was no  evidence
    of any dependency beyond normal emotional ties between  the  two.   The
    evidence relied upon to demonstrate that they had resided together  was
    approximately three years old so this did not confirm  their  residence
    together.  Even if they were this did not demonstrate  any  dependency.
    If the Appellant's  sister  wished  to  she  could  relocate  with  the
    Appellant if not she could continue to remain in contact with  him  via
    modern means of communication.

9.   The Judge had overlooked the decision in the case of Nasim [2014]  UKUT
    00025 that Article 8 has limited utility and private life  cases  where
    such cases are "far removed from  the  protection  of  an  individual's
    moral and physical integrity".  The Tribunal in the instant  case  made
    no reference to the Appellant's moral and physical integrity and in any
    event little weight should be given to a private life established  when
    a person's immigration status was unlawful or precarious.

10.  The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Page  on  29th  January  2015.   In
    granting permission to appeal he wrote:

         "The Judge's reasoning at paragraphs 51 to 58 of  the  decision  is
         open to challenge because the Judge at paragraph 58 of the decision
         accepted that the Appellant was an overstayer but said  that  given
         that the Appellant had been in the United Kingdom for eleven  years
         and had acquired a degree which allowed him to make  a  useful  and
         productive contribution to society and had family  members  in  the
         United Kingdom with whom he lived it would be disproportionate  and
         in breach of Article 8 rights to family life under Article 8 if  he
         were removed to Nigeria.  At paragraph 56 the Judge said  that  the
         Appellant is now 30 years of age and had obtained  a  qualification
         in the UK so it could be argued that he could  return  to  Nigeria,
         the country where he spent the majority of the first eighteen years
         of his life.   Even  though  the  Appellant's  appeal  fell  to  be
         determined so far as  Article  8  was  concerned  under  the  legal
         position which existed prior to 9th July 2012 the Judge's  decision
         does appear to be somewhat generous to the Appellant.  The  grounds
         of appeal are arguable so permission to appeal is granted".

Documentation Considered

11.  On the file was the Respondent's bundle  which  comprised:  immigration
    information on form PF1; Appellant's application for further  leave  to
    remain on form FLR(O) received 29th February 2012; Appellant's judicial
    review grounds running to six  pages;  decision  of  27th  March  2013;
    consent order whereby the Respondent agreed to withdraw the decision of
    27th March 2013 and issue a fresh decision within  three  months  dated
    29th November 2013, this led to the decision of 17th  March  2014;  and
    explanation for refusal dated 17th March 2014. The  Appellant's  bundle
    submitted at first instance comprised  the  witness  statement  of  the
    Appellant 17th October  2014;  statement  of  the  Appellant's  sister,
    documents common to the Respondent's bundle; documents relating to  the
    judicial review proceedings.

The Error of Law Stage

12.  At the hearing before me I initially had to decide  whether  there  was
    an error of law in the First-tier decision such that it fell to be  set
    aside and the matter reheard.  If there was not then the decision would
    stand.  Whilst the permission to appeal had referred to the decision of
    the First-tier appearing "to be somewhat generous to the Appellant"  of
    itself that  would  not  constitute  an  arguable  error  of  law.  The
    Respondent would have  to  show  that  there  had  been  some  material
    misdirection by the Judge in the determination.

13.  One such misdirection did appear  on  the  face  of  the  determination
    namely the Judge's view that Article 8 was to be assessed  without  any
    reference to the post-July 2012 Rules.  There had been two  conflicting
    Court of Appeal decisions in Edgehill and Haleemuddeen [2014] EWCA  Civ
    558 one of which had said that the post-July 2012 Rules could not apply
    where the application had been made before  that  date  (Edgehill)  and
    another case which had appeared to assume that the post-July 2012 Rules
    applied as soon as they came into force (Haleemuddeen).  The matter was
    finally resolved by the case of Singh [2015] EWCA Civ 74 which held but
    for a brief window between July and September 2012 decisions made after
    July 2012 were to be assessed  under  the  post-July  2012  Immigration
    Rules.

14.  That might not lead to a material error of law such that  the  decision
    should be set aside depending on how the  Judge  had  carried  out  the
    proportionality  exercise  in  this  case.   In  oral  submissions  the
    Presenting Officer stated that following the case of Singh the  Judge's
    decision that the appeal fell to be determined under the pre-July  2012
    jurisprudence  was  clearly  wrong.   The  Judge  had  failed  to  find
    compelling circumstances not recognised by the Rules.  The  Appellant's
    sister was now looking for a job and was taking  first  steps  to  look
    after herself.  She was thus not dependent upon the Appellant.  It  was
    conceded by the Respondent that the Judge had not in fact  allowed  the
    appeal under Article 8 on private life grounds, he had  allowed  it  on
    the family life relationship with the Appellant's sister.

15.  In reply Counsel for the Appellant (who had represented  the  Appellant
    at first instance) relied on a passage from the case  of  Re  B  [2013]
    1WLR 1911 [2013] UKSC 33 a decision in care proceedings  but  important
    for this case because it reminded an Appellate  Court  in  reviewing  a
    Judge's first instance decision that the Appellate Court:

         "had to take into account both the advantages which the trial Judge
         had enjoyed in seeing the witnesses and the parties  and  also  the
         fact that in focussing on future possibilities involved he had been
         making a valued judgment  not  exercising  a  discretion  and  that
         accordingly the Appellate Court should only intervene where it  was
         satisfied that [the trial Judge's]  decision  was  wrong  and  that
         having regard to the conclusions reached by the Judge he  had  been
         justified for the reasons he had  given  in  determining  that  the
         threshold had been crossed".

     If the Appellant could not meet the Rules then  Article  8  had  to  be
    considered and there was family life  between  the  Appellant  and  his
    sister.  They had been brought up together, the sister was now an adult
    but if the relationship was severed there would be an impact upon her.

16.  Having heard submissions and considered the papers in this case  (there
    was no Rule 24 response to the grant of permission), I indicated that I
    found there was a material error of law such that the decision  of  the
    First-tier should be set aside and the decision  remade.   I  indicated
    that I would give fuller reasons in my determination which  I  now  do.
    The Judge had approached the assessment of proportionality in this case
    on the mistaken basis that he should consider the law as it was  before
    July 2012.  Following Singh that was wrong and it led to the error that
    insufficient weight was placed by  the  Judge  in  the  proportionality
    exercise on the fact that the Appellant could  not  succeed  under  the
    Rules.

17.  Furthermore the relationship between the Appellant and his  sister  had
    been formed in this country at a time when the Appellant had no  status
    to be here and thus little weight could be  afforded  it.   The  actual
    provision in Section 117B refers to a relationship  with  a  qualifying
    partner.  Neither the Rules nor the section  makes  specific  provision
    for relationships between  adults  who  are  close  family  members  as
    opposed to partners/spouses.  Nevertheless such a gap means that it  is
    even more important for an Appellant relying on a relationship with  an
    adult sibling as in this case to demonstrate that there are  compelling
    or compassionate circumstances such  that  the  application  should  be
    allowed outside the Rules.

18.  The Judge's finding was that there was an emotional dependency  between
    the Appellant and his sister, placing  weight  on  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant's sister came to this country when she was 9 years of age and
    thus the fact that she had overstayed as a minor could not be something
    which could be held against her.  That may well be so but the Judge had
    to assess the case under Article 8 as at the  date  of  hearing  before
    him, 23rd October 2014 by which time  the  Appellant's  sister  was  20
    years of age.  It was not clear from the determination what aspects  of
    the relationship between the Appellant and his  now  adult  sister  had
    created a present emotional dependency  over  and  above  normal  ties.
    That they had been brought up together would apply in a high proportion
    of cases of adult siblings and  the  Judge  had  failed  to  adequately
    demonstrate why  in  this  particular  case  it  led  to  an  emotional
    dependency. I therefore set aside the decision at  first  instance  and
    proceeded to rehear the appeal there being no  reason  why  the  matter
    should be remitted back  to  the  First-tier  to  be  heard  again.   I
    enquired what further evidence if  any  the  Appellant  wished  to  put
    forward (the Appellant's bundle filed for the  first  instance  hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal was on file).  I was informed  that  the
    Appellant would give evidence but the Appellant's sister would  not  as
    she was not able to attend the court hearing due to  work  commitments.
    Neither would Ms Abu (who had not given evidence at first  instance  in
    any event).

The Appellant's Evidence

19.  In oral testimony the Appellant stated that he had  nothing  to  return
    to in Nigeria as there was nobody there and he could not  find  a  job.
    The only living relative in Nigeria was his father  with  whom  he  had
    never lived under the same roof.  The impact on the Appellant's  sister
    of the Appellant's removal would be  terrible.   Although  she  was  an
    adult he was still responsible for her.  One  difficulty  she  had  was
    that she was not entitled to student loans and therefore  "we  come  up
    with the fees".  She had had to  defer  the  second  year  of  her  Law
    degree, having completed the first year, whilst the balance of the fees
    for her first year were paid and the fees in  advance  for  the  second
    year were found.  Both the Appellant and  his  sister  had  lived  with
    their aunt Ms Abu since being in the  United  Kingdom.   The  Appellant
    repeated that he had been unable to find a  job  despite  his  Chemical
    Engineering qualification because of his immigration status.

20.   In  cross-examination  the  Appellant  was  asked  why  his   Chemical
    engineering qualification would be of no use to him  in  Nigeria.   The
    Appellant replied that as far as he was aware there was a high level of
    unemployment in Nigeria.  To find a job it was a question  of  who  you
    knew and his chances would be virtually zero.   He  was  not  sure  how
    specialised the job market would be.  The Appellant was not sure  which
    country his mother was in, last time he had heard from her  he  was  14
    years of age.  Today the Appellant said his sister was at work  as  she
    was trying to raise funds to get back to college.  She had to get  some
    cash together and on balance it was considered it  was  more  important
    that she should  be  working  that  day.   She  worked  for  the  store
    "Target".  The money for the first part of his sister's fees  had  been
    obtained from family friends more by way of a loan.   He  doubted  that
    these family friends  could  help  him  integrate  back  into  life  in
    Nigeria.  They had given them  money  because  they  thought  that  the
    Appellant's application would be successful, he would be able  to  work
    and pay them back.

21.  His own fees when he had studied for Chemical  Engineering  were  about
    �1,000 per year.  He had been able to afford that from doing odd  jobs.
    The Appellant's sister proposed to continue her studies  at  University
    of Westminster.  She had 30 months' discretionary leave  (which  I  was
    informed would expire in September 2015).  The Appellant said that they
    owed �5,000 as the balance for the first  year's  fees  and  a  further
    �9,000 in advance for the second year's fees.  He then added  that  she
    had not come to the Tribunal today because "I can't see  her  losing  a
    week's pay".  I  queried  this  with  the  Appellant  as  his  sister's
    attendance to give evidence would only  have  taken  up  one  day.   He
    repeated that on balance he did not consider it was important  for  her
    to be here today.  In re-examination he said he had no contact with his
    aunt in Ogun State in Nigeria, he did intend to repay the loan for  his
    sister's course fees.

Closing Submissions

22.  In  closing  for  the  Respondent  it  was  argued  that  in  assessing
    proportionality of interference the Immigration Act and the Rules  were
    relevant.  The Appellant could not satisfy the Rules, he had  not  been
    in the United Kingdom for twenty years and  therefore  the  application
    had to go outside the Immigration Rules.  There was no family  life  in
    this case for the purposes of Article 8.  There was no evidence showing
    that the relationship between the Appellant and his sister was over and
    above normal family ties.  The Appellant's  sister  and  the  Appellant
    were taking their own steps in life.  She was now 21 years of  age  and
    was studying law while working as  a  retail  assistant  for  the  shop
    Target. She was  not  present  to  support  the  Appellant's  evidence.
    Indeed the contrary was the case, a conscious decision  had  been  made
    that she should work rather than attend the  Tribunal.   The  Appellant
    had said he was to a large extent dependent on Ms Abu.   The  financial
    provisions in Section 117B weighed against the Appellant.  He was 17 or
    18 years old when he entered the United Kingdom  but  he  had  spent  a
    large part of his life in Nigeria.  His sister only  had  discretionary
    leave until September 2015.  The Appellant had qualifications which  he
    could use on return to Nigeria.  For the Appellant to  say  he  had  no
    family ties in Nigeria was insufficient.  His removal was proportionate
    to the public interest.

23.  In closing for the Appellant it was argued that  categories  of  family
    life were never closed and that there was  family  life  in  this  case
    between the Appellant and his sister.  Where family life did exist  the
    United Kingdom was obliged to encourage it to flourish.  The  only  way
    the Appellant could  be  removed  would  be  pursuant  to  the  aim  of
    immigration control.  If the Appellant was removed it would have  harsh
    consequences for the Appellant and reliance was placed on the five step-
    by-step approach  set  out  in  Razgar.   The  Appellant  came  from  a
    political family in Nigeria.  He had no  contact  with  his  father  or
    mother.  There were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  renewing  his  life
    there.  Following European Court  of  Human  Rights  decisions  such  a
    Boultif one had look at all the factors and weigh them.  The  Appellant
    did speak English, he was fully integrated into society and his  appeal
    should be allowed.

Findings

24.  The Appellant seeks to remain in this country outside  the  Immigration
    Rules under the provisions of Article 8.  His appeal in relation to his
    private life was not allowed at first instance, the Judge stating  that
    the Appellant might be able to establish a  private  life  in  Nigeria.
    The Judge allowed the appeal on the basis of the Appellant's right to a
    family life specifically his relationship with his sister.

25.  As I have indicated neither the Rules nor  the  section  make  specific
    provision for a family life  argument  to  be  put  forward  where  the
    parties are adult siblings as opposed to partners.  Whilst I appreciate
    that the categories of family life are not closed in order  to  succeed
    outside the Rules the Appellant would have to  demonstrate  that  there
    was  something  very  compelling   and/or   compassionate   about   his
    relationship with his sister and  the  disruption  that  removal  would
    cause.

26.  In assessing the claim under Article 8 outside  the  Rules  I  bear  in
    mind  the  step-by-step  approach  required  by  the  case  of  Razgar.
    (1)  Will the proposed removal be an interference by a public authority
    with the exercise of the applicant's right to respect for  his  private
    or (as the case may be) family life? (2)  If so, will such interference
    have  consequences  of  such  gravity  as  potentially  to  engage  the
    operation of article 8? (3)  If so, is such interference in accordance
    with the  law?  (4)  If  so,  is  such  interference  necessary  in  a
    democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety
    or the economic well-being  of  the  country,  for  the  prevention  of
    disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or  for  the
    protection of the rights and freedoms of others? (5)  If so,  is  such
    interference proportionate to the legitimate public end  sought  to  be
    achieved?

27.  That the Appellant has  a  family  life  with  his  sister  is  not  in
    dispute.  What is in dispute is the nature and extent  of  that  family
    life.  The evidence strongly suggests that the Appellant and his sister
    are leading their own independent lives.  Whilst they may be living  at
    the same address, the Appellant's sister who is now 21  is  working  to
    support herself and has ambitions to  continue  her  studies  (assuming
    that she is granted an  extension  of  leave  when  her  current  leave
    expires September  this  year).   It  is  difficult  to  see  in  those
    circumstances how the Appellant and his sister can now be said to  have
    an  emotional  dependency  on  each  other  which  goes  beyond  normal
    emotional ties.  I appreciate the point made by the Supreme Court in Re
    B that due weight should be given to the fact that the trial Judge  has
    seen and heard the witnesses.  However the Judge approached  this  case
    on a mistaken legal basis and therefore the decision at first  instance
    was set aside.  Since then I too have had the  benefit  of  seeing  the
    Appellant give evidence and am therefore in a position  to  assess  the
    evidence myself. The Appellant's sister was not prepared  to  take  one
    day off work to come to the Tribunal to support the  Appellant  in  his
    evidence.  In fact the case was listed at 2 o'clock indicating that she
    probably needed only to have taken off half  a  day.   That  there  are
    debts to be repaid in connection with the studying that the Appellant's
    sister has undertaken so far is not necessarily of  crucial  importance
    in this case but it does  show  that  the  Appellant's  sister  is  not
    financially dependent on the Appellant.

28.  He is financially dependent on a third person Ms Abu who did  not  make
    herself known to the Tribunal at first instance and did not  attend  to
    give evidence before me.  The family life between the Appellant and his
    sister would be interfered with by the  removal  of  the  Appellant  to
    Nigeria.  I do not need for the purposes of this case to  go  into  the
    issue of whether it is reasonable to expect the Appellant's  sister  to
    return to Nigeria with him.  She is an  adult  and  can  make  her  own
    decision.  She can however continue her relationship with the Appellant
    through modern means of communication if she chooses to remain  in  the
    United Kingdom.

29.  It is in the public interest that persons who seek  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom are financially independent because such persons are not
    a burden on tax payers and are better able to  integrate  into  society
    (Section 117B(3)).  The Appellant is not financially independent and it
    is not therefore in the public interest that he should  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom.  He has a qualification which he could put  to  use  in
    Nigeria where UK  qualifications  are  considered  to  have  particular
    value.  He has lived the majority of his life in Nigeria and appears to
    have a relative there who he admits to, his aunt.  I  do  not  consider
    that he has lost all cultural, family and social ties with his  country
    of origin.  I consider that there are no  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    his relocation to Nigeria and re-establishing his life there.  In  this
    connection I note that the Judge at first instance considered that  the
    Appellant might be able to establish a private life in Nigeria.

30.  I do not consider that the consequences for the Appellant's  sister  of
    the Appellant's removal to Nigeria would be such as to lead this appeal
    to being allowed outside the Immigration Rules.  I do not consider that
    the consequences of the  disruption  to  their  relationship  would  be
    unduly harsh.  As I have indicated the Appellant's  sister  is  already
    living her own life and would continue  to  do  so.  In  assessing  the
    proportionality of the interference with the  Appellant's  relationship
    with his sister, due weight should be afforded to  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant cannot bring himself within the Immigration Rules, that he is
    not financially independent and that he can re-establish  his  life  in
    Nigeria.  On the other side of the equation, I do not consider that the
    effect on the Appellant's sister  would  be  unduly  harsh  as  she  is
    capable of living her own life and is doing so.  I  consider  therefore
    that such interference as there might be would be proportionate to  the
    legitimate  aim  being  pursued.  The  legitimate  aim  is  immigration
    control, as the Appellant is  here  unlawfully  as  an  overstayer.   I
    therefore dismiss the Appellant's appeal against the decisions  of  the
    Respondent. I make no anonymity order as  there  is  no  public  policy
    reason for so doing.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set it aside.

I have remade the decision by dismissing the Appellant's appeal against  the
Respondent's decisions of March 2014.

Appellant's appeal dismissed.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Although the file is not marked with evidence  of  payment  of  a  fee  (the
appeal being against a decision to remove) the Judge at first instance  made
a fee award against the Respondent.  To the extent that any fee was  payable
and that therefore a fee award could be made, I set that decision  aside  as
well for the same reasons which I have set aside the decision  allowing  the
Appellant's appeal.
