Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Bradshaw (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills (HOPO)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Camp promulgated on 7th July 2014 following  a  hearing  on  11th
    June 2014 at Birmingham, Sheldon  Court.   In  the  determination,  the
    judge allowed the appeal of the Appellant.  The Respondent Secretary of
    State, subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to  appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Pakistan, who was  born  on  20th
    March 1991.   He  appealed  against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State against his removal on grounds that such  a  removal
    would involve a breach of his rights under the Refugee Convention 1951,
    and that such a decision would be incompatible with  his  rights  under
    the European Convention of Human Rights.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The essence of the Appellant's claim is that he is a Pakistani national
    of Jowar village in Bunir District near the Khyber Pass, and  that  his
    father was a member of the Awami National Party (ANP) and  was  in  the
    "district cabinet".  The Appellant himself was also a  "active  member"
    of the ANP.  When in June or July 2001 the Taliban took over the  Bunir
    District, they started to attack ANP members.  The  Appellant  fled  to
    Mardan.  He did not feel safe there.  He relocated to Peshawar.   There
    he received a call from the Taliban saying that they knew he  had  gone
    to Mardan and was now in Peshawar, and as a result of this he moved  to
    Karachi.  He stayed there for about a year and a half.

 4. When, one night in 2011, he was out of usual place of board in Karachi,
    he stumbled upon a friend, and he was informed that his room  had  been
    broken into, and so  he  moved  to  Lahore.   From  there  he  went  to
    Islamabad.  There an agent helped him to arrange to leave Pakistan on a
    student visa.  His fear now is that if he returns, he will not be  safe
    from the Taliban and he relies upon a report from  the  expert  by  the
    name of Mrs Mooen who claims that  the  reach  of  the  Taliban  is  so
    extensive that the Appellant would not be safe anywhere in Pakistan.

The Judge's Findings

 5. The judge heard submissions from the Respondent's  representative  that
    even if the Appellant was found to be a member of  the  ANP,  "internal
    relocation was possible" (paragraph 22).  This was despite  the  expert
    opinion of Mrs Mooen.  The Appellant had, after all,  lived  in  Lahore
    and he had lived in Islamabad, and he had done so "without interference
    from the  Taliban.   He  had  spent  a  significant  time  in  Pakistan
    arranging his student visa" (paragraph 22).

 6. The judge accepted that the Taliban have a strong grip in  some  areas,
    which included Bunir and have  infiltrated  other  parts  of  Pakistan,
    including Karachi (see paragraph 25).  He accepted  that  some  of  the
    objections against the Appellant's claim lacked cogency (paragraph 26).



 7. Nevertheless, there were question marks in relation to the  Appellant's
    own conduct, including the fact that  the  Appellant  had  not  claimed
    asylum timeously, had fled, had not reported back to  the  authorities,
    and when apprehended subsequently, had made a run for it (see paragraph
    13 of the determination).

 8. In addition, the "considerable detail" in the witness statement for the
    Appellant, albeit prepared by experienced solicitors,  showed  that  on
    the lower standard, that the Appellant had a viable claim on the  basis
    of which he would succeed (paragraph 38).  On  this  basis,  the  judge
    accepted that the Appellant was a member of the ANP, that he  had  been
    targeted by the Taliban, and that he risked physical harm  if  returned
    to Pakistan (see paragraph 41).  The appeal is allowed.

Grounds of Application

 9. The grounds of application state that the judge did not give reasons or
    adequate reasons for his findings on material matters.  It is said that
    he failed to take into account the conflicts  of  opinion  or  material
    matters.

10. On 25th July 2014, permission to appeal was granted on the  basis  that
    the judge appears not to have given proper reasons for his  finding  at
    paragraph 42 that sufficiency of protection  was  inadequate  and  that
    internal relocation was "unrealistic".

11. On 7th August 2014, a Rule 24 response was entered by Mr Bradshaw.

Submissions

12. In his submissions before me, Mr Mills,  appearing  on  behalf  of  the
    Respondent Secretary of State, explained that the personal  history  of
    the Appellant was such that his evidence could  simply  not  be  relied
    upon.  He had not entered the UK as an asylum seeker.  He  had  on  9th
    October 2011 applied for a Tier 4 (General) Student visa and  this  was
    issued.  Nevertheless, the Appellant did not  enrol  and  commence  his
    studies by  20th  February  2012  as  required.   When  his  leave  was
    curtailed, he was given a right of appeal, which he did  not  exercise.
    Subsequently he was arrested for fraud and overstaying.  He  was  taken
    to Collindale Police Station where he told officers that  he  had  done
    casual building work and had been paying rent of ï¿½40 per week.

13. When he was released from detention on 8th February 2013, and  required
    to maintain regular reporting, he did not report.  He did not attend  a
    substantive asylum interview date on 18th February 2013.  Where on 24th
    July 2013 he was encountered again during an  immigration  arrest  team
    visit to the "Afghan Bazaar" in Edgware, the Appellant made a  run  for
    the rear exit and had to be apprehended.   During  all  this  time  the
    Appellant maintained that he wished to make an asylum  claim  which  he
    did not.

14. This was the reason why the refusal letter had drawn attention  to  the
    proper  application  of  Section  8  of  the  Asylum  and   Immigration
    (Treatment of Claimants) Act 2004 in this case.  It is in this  context
    that the Appellant's claim had to be evaluated.

15. Second, in evaluating the Appellant's claim in  this  context,  it  was
    remarkable that the judge had found the Appellant to  be  efficient  in
    all these respects outlined, together  with  ANP  membership  documents
    that were produced by the Appellant which could not be properly  relied
    upon (see paragraph 30) as well as other aspects  in  relation  to  the
    claim that he was making, which could not be properly verified.

16. All of this, however, changed when the judge came around to making  his
    final decision at paragraph 39 of the determination.  Here,  the  judge
    observes  that  the  Appellant's  witness  statement  of  "considerable
    detail" was one which "was not the sort  of  document  which  might  be
    expected if the claim  was  not  genuine"  (paragraph  39).   This  was
    perplexing given that in the next breath, the judge observed that,

         "The witness statement is clearly drafted by solicitors and not the
         Appellant's direct record of the matters contained in it (which  is
         not, of course, to suggest that the solicitors have  done  anything
         other than  turn  what  the  Appellant  said  into  an  appropriate
         format).  It would obviously be absurd  to  assess  credibility  by
         reference to the length of  a  witness  statement"  (paragraph  38,
         paragraph 39).

17. Yet, this was exactly what the judge appears to have done in looking at
    the twenty page witness statement.  This is because the judge concluded
    that,

         "I have formed the view that the corrections and additions  in  the
         witness statement have been made in a genuine attempt to deal  with
         the matters which were unclear or apparently discrepant.  If I  may
         use a vernacular expression, I do not consider that the  Appellant,
         finding himself in a hole, has  gone  on  digging.   The  level  of
         detail is such as to persuade me that there is a core of  truth  in
         the Appellant's account, despite his abhorrent behaviour and  other
         matters cited as affecting his credibility" (paragraph 39).

    The judge had then gone on to accept the  conclusions  reached  by  Mrs
    Mooen in her report (paragraph 40) which had not been accepted  by  the
    Secretary of State and had not been subject to a proper analysis.

18. The judge then at paragraph 41 concluded that the Appellant's claim was
    credible in all the three different  respects  that  he  had  outlined.
    Yet, no reasons were given to reach these  conclusions  in  the  manner
    that they had been reached.

19. For his part, Mr Bradshaw submitted that he had  placed  reliance  upon
    his Rule 24 response, which properly analysed the findings of paragraph
    39 made by the judge.  He submitted that if one  looked  at  the  well-
    known case of Chiver (10758), it was quite clear that,

         "It is perfectly possible for an  Adjudicator  to  believe  that  a
         witness is not telling the truth about matters, has exaggerated his
         story to make  his  case  better,  or  is  simply  uncertain  about
         matters, and still be persuaded that the centrepiece of  the  story
         stands".

20. When looked at in this context, it was clear that the judge's  findings
    at paragraphs 28 and 29, referring to the expert report  by  Mrs  Mooen
    was such as to properly lead him to conclude that the Appellant's claim
    was a genuine one.

21. In reply, Mr Mills submitted that the only reason why the judge allowed
    the appeal was on the basis of the lengthy witness statement  that  had
    been prepared by professional solicitors.  That in itself was no reason
    to allow the appeal.



Error of Law

22. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside the decision.   My  reasons  are  as
    follows.  It is  well-known  that,  "it  is  necessary  for  judges  to
    identify and resolve key conflicts in the evidence and explain in clear
    and brief terms their reasons, so that the parties can  understand  why
    they have won or lost" (see Haddon-Cave J in  Budhathoki  (reasons  for
    decisions) [2014] UKUT 341).

23. This is a case where it is not possible to decipher why  the  Appellant
    in this case wins and the Respondent Secretary  of  State  loses.   The
    core of the difficulty lies at paragraph  39.   Mr  Bradshaw's  valiant
    attempts to suggest (which he does also in his Rule 24 response) do not
    persuade me otherwise.

24. First, the judge is clear that, despite "his  abhorrent  behaviour  and
    other matters cited as affecting his credibility" the appeal is  to  be
    allowed because of a witness statement prepared and "clearly drafted by
    solicitors".  Yet, even if this is an account given by  the  Appellant,
    this is an Appellant who in every other respect has been  found  to  be
    lacking in credibility up to the point of the  Witness  Statement,  and
    thereafter it is simply not possible to discern why a witness statement
    in itself tilts the balance in favour of the Appellant as it does.

25. Second, this is all the more so given that the judge himself recognises
    that, "it would obviously be absurd to assess credibility by  reference
    to the length of a witness statement".

26. Third, insofar as the judge does attach the level of credence  that  it
    does to the witness statement, it is  unclear  what  is  meant  by  the
    statement that, "if I  may  use  a  vernacular  expression,  I  do  not
    consider that the Appellant, finding himself in a  hole,  has  gone  on
    digging".  This is a  curious  statement  in  circumstances  where  the
    Appellant has done next to nothing to set out his claim for  asylum  up
    to the point that the witness statement is prepared  and  he  comes  to
    court.

27. Just because the Appellant has stopped digging, to use  the  vernacular
    again, does not mean to say that his claim succeeds as  a  genuine  and
    viable claim for asylum, for that reason alone.

28. Finally, it is in this context, that  the  firm  conclusions  that  the
    Appellant is a member of the ANP, that he  has  been  targeted  by  the
    Taliban, and that he does risk physical harm if  returned  to  Pakistan
    (see paragraph 41) is highly questionable.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside  the  decision  of  the
original judge.  This appeal is  to  be  remitted  back  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal in Birmingham to be determined by a judge other than Judge Camp  on
a substantive basis to be determined de novo under  Practice  Statement  7.2
because the nature or extent of the judicial fact-finding exercise  is  such
that it is deemed necessary in order for the decision in the  appeal  to  be
remade that it be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

No anonymity direction is made.
