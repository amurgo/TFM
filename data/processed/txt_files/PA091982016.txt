Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Martin, of Jain, Neil & Ruddy, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Porter, promulgated on 5 June 2017.  His  grounds  are  stated  in  the
    application for permission (which in terms of the TP (UT)  Rules  2008,
    rule 23 (1A), now stands as the notice of appeal to the UT).

 2. The following outcome is agreed between the parties.

 3. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal errs in law, and is set aside.

 4. In remaking the decision, the respondent accepts that account should be
    taken of new  evidence  to  show  that  the  relationship  between  the
    appellant and his wife is genuine and subsisting, and  that  since  the
    date of hearing in the FtT, they have had a child.

 5. The appellant's appeal, as brought to the  FtT,  is  allowed  on  human
    rights (article 8) grounds.

 6. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
