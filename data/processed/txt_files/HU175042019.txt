Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Tan, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Leighton-Jones, Sponsor


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to the Respondent as the Appellant as she was before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  She is a citizen of Zambia.  Her date of birth is
    8 April 1978.

 2. The Secretary of State was granted permission by First  -tier  Tribunal
    Judge (FTTJ) O'Garro on 30 December 2020 to appeal against the decision
    of FTTJ Turner allowing the Appellant's appeal against the decision  of
    the ECO on 10 October 2019 to refuse her application for leave to enter
    the UK.  The matter was determined by Judge Turner  on  the  papers  as
    requested by the Appellant.

 3. The Appellant made an application to join  her  husband  (the  Sponsor)
    here in the UK.  He is a British citizen.  Her application was  refused
    by the  ECO  on  the  basis  that  she  could  not  meet  the  language
    requirements of the Rules.  However, it was  accepted  that  she  could
    meet all other requirements of the Rules.  There had  been  an  earlier
    application made by the Appellant which was refused by  the  ECO  on  a
    number of grounds including the Appellant not being able  to  meet  the
    English language requirements of the Rules.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 4. The FTTJ summarised the Appellant's evidence, namely, that  she  speaks
    English fluently and did not anticipate that she would need to evidence
    this.  She speaks English with the Sponsor.  In addition, her  evidence
    is that since she and her husband have been separated she has  suffered
    issues with her mental health due to the  stress  that  separation  has
    caused.

 5. The FTTJ, in his findings at paragraph 27, stated  that  the  Appellant
    did not dispute that she had failed to complete  the  test  before  she
    submitted her application form.  She had  been  given  dates  after  to
    complete the test; however, she was not offered a date  for  completion
    of the test before the expiry of the 28-day appeal period and therefore
    she did not consider there was any point in sitting the test.

 6. The FTTJ considered whether there were exceptional circumstances in the
    context of  GEN.3.1  and  3.2.   The  judge  found  that  the  evidence
    demonstrated  that  the  Appellant  and  her  husband  understood   the
    requirements of the Rules and were in a position to  make  arrangements
    for the completion of the test.

 7. The FTTJ found as follows:

         "32. I note however in the application for entry clearance that the
             Appellant claimed that she spoke English fluently and that she
             communicates with her husband in English.  The Appellant  also
             claims in her documentation that she has built a  relationship
             with her husband's  family  whilst  communicating  via  Skype,
             again suggesting that this was conducted in English.

         33.  Overall, the Appellant has produced evidence that she has made
             enquiries of the various tests providers and explained a  lack
             of understanding of the requirements of the Rules.   Alongside
             this, she has  explained  that  she  does  speak  English  and
             evidences this by fact that she communicates with her  husband
             and extended family in English.  I  find  therefore  that  the
             Appellant is likely to be able to speak English certainly to a
             basic standard.

         34.  The Appellant had met  her  husband  in  Zambia  when  he  was
             present  having  intended  to  relocate.   He  had  sold   his
             businesses in the UK to facilitate this.  He was then made  to
             leave Zambia when his Visa was  terminated.   The  Appellant's
             husband has not since travelled back to  Zambia,  despite  the
             Appellant's husband's clear fondness  for  the  country.   The
             Appellant describe living a dream  life  in  Zambia  with  her
             husband which again indicates that if  given  the  choice  the
             pair would have remained  in  Zambia  to  enjoy  married  life
             there.  Although the Appellant has not  evidenced  any  formal
             barrier to her husband returning to Zambia, the evidence to me
             indicates that there is a barrier to the  Appellant's  husband
             returning to Zambia.

         35.  The Appellant refers to the impact that this process has taken
             upon her mental health however I have seen no medical evidence
             to support this connection."

 8. The FTTJ directed himself in respect of R v Secretary of State ex parte
    Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 and made the following findings:

         "43. The consequence of refusal  in  this  case  is  to  delay  the
             Appellant joining her husband in the UK until such  time  that
             she passes the English language test.  I say that as based  on
             my findings above, it is likely that when she is able to  take
             the test, she is likely to pass it.  All other requirements of
             the Rules have been satisfied.

         44.  As noted above, I find that there are barriers preventing  the
             Appellant's husband from joining her in Zambia.

         45.  In ordinary times, it could be said that a short delay to  the
             Appellant being able to join her husband may well  not  amount
             to unjustifiably harsh consequences.  However, we are  not  in
             ordinary times.  The Appellant has been unable to  arrange  an
             English language test anywhere in  Zambia  or  a  neighbouring
             African country on account of the Covid 19 pandemic.  This has
             been evidenced.  It is unclear  how  long  the  pandemic  will
             impact upon such matters.  The  delay  could  be  substantial.
             All the while the Appellant and her husband  remain  separated
             because of this failure to pass the test which is likely to be
             passed when arrangements are made.

         46.  I  balance  that  against  all  other  Rules  that  have  been
             satisfied.  The Appellant intends  to  go  to  live  with  her
             husband who meets the financial requirements.   There  are  no
             other issues arising that would weight against  the  Appellant
             being able to join her husband in the UK, noting section  117B
             above.  It appears that the relationship between the Appellant
             and her husband developed whilst her husband was in Zambia  on
             a temporary Visa however the evidence provided shows  that  he
             had every intention of resettling in Zambia to the extent that
             he had sold his businesses in the UK.

         47.  In consider the issue that the English language test seeks  to
             address.  The Rule and provision in section 117B is to  ensure
             that people who remain in the UK can speak to  a  basic  level
             the English language.  It is agreed fact that this saves  cost
             to the  public  purse.   As  noted  above,  I  find  that  the
             Appellant on balance is likely to be able to speak English  to
             at least the basic level, thus addressing this issue.

         48.  Overall, I find that the refusal of the application for  leave
             to enter the UK is a disproportionate  interference  with  the
             Appellant's  family  life  when  noting   the   objective   of
             maintaining effective immigration control."

The Grounds of Appeal

 9. The Secretary of State's grounds of appeal at paragraphs 1 and 2 do not
    identify a potential arguable error of law.  At paragraph 3 the grounds
    assert that the FTTJ's  finding  at  [33]  of  the  decision  that  the
    Appellant speaks English to at least a basic standard  is  "surprising"
    not only because the appeal was determined on the papers but because it
    was not for the FTTJ to make their own assessment of  English  language
    competency.

10. In addition the FTTJ's finding at [45]  that  the  Appellant  has  been
    unable to make a test appointment due to the Covid-19 pandemic is not a
    basis for allowing the appeal in the light of the  finding  that  there
    were no exceptional circumstances.

11. Mr Tan essentially relied on the grounds of appeal;  however,  he  also
    raised another ground of appeal namely that the finding at [44],  there
    are barriers preventing the  Sponsor  from  joining  the  Appellant  in
    Zambia, is not grounded in the evidence.

12. Mr Leighton-Jones, the Sponsor, was very helpful  in  assisting  me  to
    navigate my way through the evidence that was before the ECO.

Conclusion

13. It is accepted that this Appellant cannot succeed under  Article  8  as
    informed by the Rules.  In assessing proportionality, the policy of the
    Secretary of State as expressed in the Rules is not to be ignored  when
    a decision about Article 8  is  to  be  made  outside  the  Rules:   TZ
    (Pakistan) and PG (India)  v  The  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2018] EWCA Civ 1109.  The Court of Appeal in GM (Sri Lanka)
    [2019] EWCA Civ 1630 said that the test to be applied outside the Rules
    is whether a "fair balance" is  struck  between  competing  public  and
    private interests (and not one of exceptionality).

14. The grounds of appeal are essentially that the FTTJ's finding that  the
    Appellant could not speak English which was not open  to  him  and  the
    finding that the Appellant had not been able to take the  test  due  to
    the Covid-19 pandemic was not a lawful reason for allowing  the  appeal
    (in any event the failure to sit the test pre-dates the pandemic).   As
    a result of these two errors the proportionality assessment is flawed.

15. I conclude that the FTTJ attached weight to a letter from the Sponsor's
    father dated 21 October 2019 stating that he and  his  wife  had  built
    their own relationship with the Appellant through phone calls and video
    calls.  The Applicant also stated on  her  application  form  that  she
    spoke English fluently (recorded by the FTTJ at [32]).   The  FTTJ  was
    entitled to attach weight to this evidence.  It was not challenged that
    the Appellant could speak English as she claimed  in  her  application.
    The issue is that she had not passed the English  language  test.   The
    conclusion that the Appellant speaks English was  open  to  the  judge.
    There was no reason to disbelieve the Appellant. Credibility was not an
    issue raised by the ECO.  The judge attached significant weight to  the
    delay caused by the pandemic to the Appellant being able to re-sit  the
    test.  He was entitled to take this into account.  Section  85(4)  NIAA
    2002 states:

         (4)  On an appeal  under  section  82(1)  against  a  decision  the
             Tribunal may consider any matter which it thinks  relevant  to
             the substance of the  decision,  including  a  matter  arising
             after the date of the decision.

16. There was not a pandemic at the date of the  application  or  decision,
    but the FTTJ was entitled to infer that  the  pandemic  would  cause  a
    further delay to the  Appellant  being  able  to  meet  the  Rules  and
    therefore to  make  a  further  application.   This  was  a  reasonable
    inference to draw.  The FTTJ was entitled to attach weight to this.

17. In respect of the ground raised at the hearing by Mr Tan, there was  no
    application to amend the grounds, however,  no  material  error  arises
    from the finding at [44].  I accept that the judge did not explain what
    he meant by "barriers" to the husband remaining in Zambia.  However, at
    [5] the judge recorded that the Sponsor's visa expired  "unexpectedly".
    It appears from the evidence (the letter  from  the  Sponsor's  father)
    that the Sponsor was unable to  renew  his  business  visa.   The  FTTJ
    recorded at [46] that  he  had  intended  to  settle  in  Zambia.   The
    evidence before the judge disclosed  difficulties  explaining  why  the
    Sponsor had to leave Zambia and was not able to return at the  date  of
    the decision.  Perhaps the judge put it too high, describing  barriers;
    however, no material error arising from this. The judge was entitled to
    take into account why the Sponsor left Zambia.

18. The challenge in the grounds is to the assessment  of  proportionality;
    the fifth Razgar question: R (Razgar) v Home Secretary [2004]  UKHL.[1]
    It is not suggested that the  decision  does  not  interfere  with  the
    Appellant's family life under Article 8.

19. Although he did not specifically refer to  s117B  (1),  [48]  discloses
    that the FTTJ put into the balance that the  maintenance  of  effective
    immigration control is in the public interests.  This in any event,  is
    not an issue raised in the grounds.  The FTTJ found that factors  under
    s117B of the NIAA 2002 Act would not weigh  against  the  Appellant.[2]
    The decision does not disclose that  he  considered  this  as  anything
    other than neutral.

20. While the decision in respect of proportionality could have gone either
    way, the judge was entitled to allow the appeal. The  decision  is  not
    irrational.  Irrationality is not a basis of challenge, in any event.

21. Baroness Hale  in  AH  (Sudan)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department at [30] stated:

         "Appellate courts should not rush to find such misdirections simply
         because they might have reached a different conclusion on the facts
         or expressed themselves differently."

22. The FTT dealt with the appeal against the decision-maker's decision  on
    the basis of the evidence before it  and  draw  reasonable  inferences.
    The FTTJ  made  an  evaluative  assessment  of  proportionality  having
    engaged with material issues raised and he made  material  findings  on
    the evidence before him.  The decision is rational.

23. The grounds do not identify a  material  error  in  the  assessment  of
    proportionality.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow  the
    appeal under Article 8 stands.

No anonymity direction is made.

Upper Tribunal Judge McWilliam

-----------------------
[1] Lord Bingham's speech, which had the assent of Lord Steyn and Lord
Carswell, and in large part too of Lord Walker and Baroness Hale
notwithstanding their dissent as to the outcome, proposed at �17 the
following questions as those which were likely to have to be answered by an
adjudicator on an art. 8 appeal:
(1)  Will the proposed removal be an interference by a public authority
  with the exercise of the applicant's right to respect for his private or
  (as the case may be) family life?
(2)  If so, will such interference have consequences of such gravity as
  potentially to engage the operation of article 8?
(3   If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?
(4)  If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic society in the
  interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being
  of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the
  protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and
  freedoms of others?
(5)  If so, is such interference proportionate to the legitimate public end
  sought to be achieved?

[2] 117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all cases
(1)  The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public
  interest.
(2)  It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of
  the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to
  enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able to speak English, because
  persons who can speak English-
  (a)    are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
  (b)    are better able to integrate into society.
(3)  It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of
  the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to
  enter or remain in the United Kingdom are financially independent,
  because such persons
  (a)    are not a burden on taxpayers, and
  (b)    are better able to integrate into society.
(4)  Little weight should be given to-
  (a)    a private life, or
  (b)    a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the United
Kingdom unlawfully.
(5)  Little weight should be given to a private life established by a
  person at a time when the person's immigration status is precarious.
(6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the public
  interest does not require the person's removal where-
  (a)    the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with
    a qualifying child, and
