For the Appellant:     Mr Patel, Hiren Patel Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Singh, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS
Background

1. The Appellants are nationals of India who were born on  3  November  1982
   and 25 December 1969. On 20  August  2014  the  First  Appellant  made  a
   combined application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a  Tier
   1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the Points Based System (PBS)  and  for  a
   Biometric Residence Permit. The second Appellant  was  her  dependent  in
   that application and consequently I refer to the first Appellant as  'the
   Appellant' in this appeal. The application  was  refused  on  14  October
   2014. The Appellant lodged an appeal against the decision on  28  October
   2014 and the appeal was withdrawn by the Presenting Officer on 14 January
   2015 and remitted back to the Respondent for reconsideration.


2. On 28 May 2015 the Respondent refused  the  application  under  paragraph
   245DD of the  Immigration  Rules  as  the  Appellant  did  not  meet  the
   requirements of paragraph 245DD (b) under Appendix A.   The  reasons  for
   refusal were that although the Appellant had provided a  job  title  that
   was listed in  Appendix  J,  the  evidence  that  she  had  submitted  to
   demonstrate that she was active in that occupation  was  not  acceptable.
   Paragraphs 41-SD(e)(iii) and 41-SD (e) (iv) listed the evidence that must
   be submitted to demonstrate that the business was actively  trading.  The
   evidence that the Appellant had  submitted  in  relation  to  advertising
   material, and personal registration with  a  trade  body  linked  to  her
   occupation was not acceptable as it did not  cover  a  continuous  period
   commencing before 11 July 2014, up to no earlier than three months before
   the date of the occupation. Additionally the Appellant had  submitted  no
   evidence to confirm the ownership of the domain of the business  for  her
   website. The  evidence  she  had  submitted  in  relation  to  a  trading
   contract/an original letter from  a  UK-regulated  financial  institution
   with which she had a business bank account, on the  institution's  headed
   paper, confirming the dates that the business had been  trading  was  not
   acceptable as it did not cover a continuous period commencing  before  11
   July 2014, up to no earlier than three months  before  the  date  of  her
   application and the bank letter did not state the dates that her business
   had been trading. As a result the Secretary of State concluded  that  she
   had not  submitted  the  evidence  specified  at  paragraph  41-SD(e)  of
   Appendix A of the Immigration Rules and not demonstrated that she met the
   requirements of the Rules to be awarded points under provision (d) in the
   first row of Table 4 of Appendix A. The Appellant was not awarded  points
   for 'funds held in regulated financial institutions' or 'funds disposable
   in the United Kingdom' under Appendix A for the same reasons.


3. The Appellants appealed against this decision under  section  82  (1)  of
   the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (NIAA). Their appeal was
   determined on the papers by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  M  Eldridge  who
   dismissed  it  in  a  determination  promulgated  on  22  July  2016.  He
   considered the evidence submitted by the Appellant under paragraph  41-SD
   (e) (iii) and concluded that the adverts did not  bear  any  dates  other
   than 19 August 2014 and the trade certificate was dated 9 August 2014 and
   therefore did  not  meet  the  requirements  of  specified  evidenced  of
   continuous trading before 11 July 2014.  He further found that the letter
   submitted by the  Appellant  from  Santander  Bank  did  not  demonstrate
   trading before 11 January 2014; the contracts were dated 30 July or later
   and the letter from Santander Bank only confirmed credit in the  bank  on
   15 August 2014. The First-tier Tribunal Judge then  stated  that  he  has
   considered all of the documents in the Appellant's bundle but  that  they
   did  not  demonstrate  when  the  business  commenced  trading.  He  also
   concluded that  this  was  not  a  case  where  paragraph  245AA  of  the
   Immigration Rules could apply.


4. In a decision sent to the parties on 31  March  2017  I  found  that  the
   First-tier Tribunal had made a material error of law.  My  core  findings
   are at paragraphs 10 to 12 of the decision:


       "10. I am satisfied that the First-tier  Tribunal  made  a  material
       error of law for the following reasons. The First-tier Tribunal  did
       not have the benefit of hearing submissions  as  this  was  a  paper
       case. However, the Appellant's case was comprehensively set  out  in
       grounds of appeal at page 28 of her bundle. The Appellant set out at
       page 33 that she had submitted a letter from Santander Bank dated 24
       October 2014 confirming that her business was trading since  1  July
       2014. That letter was at page 119 of her bundle. In Nasim the  Upper
       Tribunal held that:


          "As held  in  Khatel  and  others  (s85A;  effect  of  continuing
          application)  [2013]  UKUT  00044  (IAC),  section  85A  of   the
          Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002   precludes   a
          tribunal, in a points-based appeal, from considering evidence  as
          to compliance with points-based Rules, where  that  evidence  was
          not before the Secretary of State when she took her decision; but
          the section does not prevent a tribunal from considering evidence
          that was  before  the  Secretary  of  State  when  she  took  the
          decision, whether or not that evidence reached her only after the
          date of application for the purposes  of  paragraph  34F  of  the
          Immigration Rules."


       11.  The reasoning for that conclusion is at paragraphs 72 to 75  of
       the decision and rests on a concession by the Respondent in Raju and
       in Nasim that that Respondent had never suggested that she  was  not
       entitled to consider post-submission but pre-decision evidence.  The
       Respondent has also made it clear that, in any event,  the  Tribunal
       was entitled to  consider  the  evidence  that  the  decision  maker
       considered. The Respondent in this case has not sought to argue that
       the letter of 24 October 2014 was not submitted in relation  to  the
       appeal in January 2015 and was therefore not before  the  Respondent
       when the decision was made or that the Respondent  has  now  reneged
       from the concession in relation to s85A. In the  circumstances,  the
       First-tier Tribunal should have considered whether that  letter  met
       the requirements of paragraph 41-SD(e)(iv). Further,  the  Appellant
       had submitted with her application dated  20  August  2014  business
       bank statements from Santander Bank for the period from 1 July  2014
       to 15 August 2014 at ages 57  to  61  of  her  bundle  which  showed
       trading of this period and consequently,  notwithstanding  the  fact
       that the Santander Bank letter dated August 2014 confirming that the
       Appellant's  business  was  trading  did  not  state  that   trading
       commenced before 11 July 2014, this information was verifiable  from
       the  other  documents  submitted  with  the  application.   In   the
       circumstances,  paragraph  245AA(d)(iii)   and/or   the   evidential
       flexibility policy applied and the Respondent should have considered
       exercising her discretion.


       12.  In the circumstances I conclude that there was a material error
       of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and in view of the
       limited fact-finding required I conclude that the decision should be
       re-made in the Upper Tribunal. "


The Re-making of the decision in the appeal

    5. The  Appellants'  application  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
       Entrepreneur  was  made  on  20  August  2014  and  consequently  the
       Appellants have a full right of appeal under the 'old' section 84  of
       the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as  the  Immigration
       Act 2014 (Commencement No.4  Transitional and Saving  Provisions  and
       Amendment) Order 2014 No 371 introduced the  new  provisions  to  any
       person who made an application after 2 March 2015 for leave to remain
       as a Tier 1, 2 or 5 Migrant or partner or child.


    6. Both representatives agreed that in the light of my findings, as  the
       decision was not in accordance with the law, it remained  outstanding
       before the Secretary of State for a lawful decision to be made.


    7. In the light of my findings, the Respondent's  decision  was  not  in
       accordance  with  the  law  as  paragraph  245AA(d)(iii)  and/or  the
       evidential flexibility policy applied and the Respondent should  have
       considered exercising her discretion for  the  reasons  given  in  my
       decision in relation to the error of law as set out above.

Conclusions:

    8. The appeal is allowed to the extent that it is not in accordance with
       the  law.  The  Respondent's  decision  was  unlawful   and   remains
       outstanding for a lawful decision to be made.

No anonymity direction is made.


Signed                                             Dated 8 July 2017
