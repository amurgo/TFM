Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Wilding, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Unrepresented


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State  has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  the
    decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Fowell   who   allowed   the
    respondent's appeal on human rights grounds against the decision of the
    Entry Clearance Officer dated 3 February 2016 refusing the respondent's
    application for entry clearance to the United Kingdom as the spouse  of
    a British national.  The Entry  Clearance  Officer  accepted  that  the
    requirements as to suitability, eligibility as to the relationship, and
    English language were met.  The financial requirements were not however
    met on the basis that the declared income fell short of  the  threshold
    of �18,600 per annum.


 2. The respondent was  not  represented  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    however her husband gave evidence before the judge.   He  is  not  here
    today and according to a letter signed by the respondent dated  6  July
    2018 he is with her in Pakistan.   The  respondent  proposed  that  her
    father-in-law will attend the hearing, but  he  has  not.   We  see  no
    justification in adjourning the hearing of this appeal in  the  absence
    of any explanation for his absence and having regard to the  nature  of
    the issues that we are to address


 3. The Secretary of  State  has  been  granted  permission  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Saffer on the basis that it was obvious from  a  reading
    of the decision that the judge allowed the appeal by a slip of the  pen
    having regard to the reasons given which were  leading  to  the  appeal
    being dismissed.


 4. The First-tier Tribunal Judge sets out in detail in his  decision,  the
    evidence relied on by the respondent as to her husband's employment  by
    McDonalds since 2012 and by Three Diamonds Indian Lounge which  it  was
    contended, in aggregate, resulted in an overall  income  of  just  over
    �25,000 a year.  The judge had concerns about the  reliability  of  the
    evidence in support of the Three Diamonds employment and  concluded  at
    [23] that the payslips provided were bogus and that the respondent  had
    relied on false evidence in support of her application.   Paragraph  24
    of his decision sets out detailed reasons for this  finding.   At  [27]
    the judge observed that:


         "Even without the concerns raised in the refusal letter  about  the
         inability to contact Three Diamonds,  the  mis-match  between  bank
         statements and pay statements leads to the  inescapable  conclusion
         that this claimed second employment is not genuine and so Mr Afridi
         did not meet the income requirement under the Rules."


 5. The judge also considered the appeal under Article 8.  After  directing
    himself correctly as to the jurisprudence in MM (Lebanon)  [2017]  UKSC
    10 and the impact on the financial criteria of the birth of a daughter,
    the judge concluded that it would not be justified, particularly having
    regard to the use of false evidence, to conclude that the decision  was
    disproportionate under Article 8.  The judge added to  that  conclusion
    the impact of Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002.  At [34] he concluded:


         "Accordingly, and for all of  the  above  reasons,  the  appeal  is
         dismissed."


 6. On the next page however under the heading "Notice of Decision"  it  is
    stated that the appeal was allowed on  human  rights  grounds.   It  is
    clear that this was a slip of the pen, nevertheless  we  are  bound  to
    have regard to the decision of the Tribunal in Katsonga  ("Slip  Rule":
    FtT's general powers) [2016] UKUT 228 (IAC).  The Slip Rule (Rule 31 of
    the First-tier Tribunal Procedure Rules) cannot be used to reverse  the
    effect of a decision.


 7. With permission having been granted we are seized of this appeal in the
    Upper Tribunal.  No reasons were advanced by the respondent to persuade
    us that the judge was  correct  in  allowing  the  appeal.  Mr  Wilding
    correctly argued that in allowing the appeal the judge  had  erred.  In
    our view the judge gave sound and sustainable  reasons  for  dismissing
    the appeal and there was no basis for allowing the appeal.


 8. We are satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in  allowing  the
    appeal.  We set aside the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    remake the decision. There has been no challenge by the  respondent  to
    the findings by the First-tier Tribunal pursuant to a notice under Rule
    24 or by a cross-appeal if that were available.  We adopt the  findings
    and reasons of the First-tier Tribunal that were rationally open to the
    First-tier Tribunal  on  the  evidence  and  conclude  that  unreliable
    evidence had been submitted in support of the contended income to  meet
    the requirement under the Rules.


 9. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal by the respondent against the  Entry
    Clearance Officer's decision.


Signed                                  Date 11 July 2018
