                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   Mr Abraham has been in the United Kingdom since January 2010,  when  he
    was given leave to enter as a Tier 4 Migrant until 16th May 2012.  Just
    in time before this leave expired, he applied to vary it, in  order  to
    study for a Diploma in Travel  and  Tourism  Marketing  at  the  London
    College of Social and Management Science.  At  K1  of  the  application
    form he set down the number  of  his  Confirmation  of  Acceptance  for
    Studies ('CAS'), while at Part L of the form he stated that the  course
    fee of �2,000 had been paid in full, as could  be  seen  from  the  CAS
    record.  In order to  satisfy  the  'maintenance'  requirement  of  the
    Rules, therefore, Mr Abraham just  had  to  have  �1,600  in  his  bank
    account for a 28-day period ending no earlier than 31 days  before  his
    application was lodged (the figure is misstated at L21 as �1,800).   At
    L22 and L24 he confirmed that he had this money in  his  own  name,  as
    could be seen from personal bank statements.  Finally, at  page  30  of
    the form, Mr Abraham listed the documents which he was  enclosing  with
    his application.  These comprised : his passport, two photographs,  two
    educational certificates, a CAS statement and a bank statement.

2.     When  the  application  came  to  be  assessed  by  a  caseworker  in
    Sheffield, she could not find a valid CAS  among  the  documents.   She
    also thought that no CAS reference number had been submitted  with  the
    application.  In that, she was mistaken, since the reference number had
    been written out at K1 of the application  form.   At  all  events,  no
    points were  awarded  for  Attributes,  while  ~  rather  oddly  ~  the
    caseworker said she was "unable"  to  assess  whether  Mr  Abraham  had
    sufficient Maintenance funds, because he had no provided  a  valid  CAS
    with his application.  The application was  therefore  refused  on  9th
    January 2013, and a decision was also taken to remove Mr Abraham  under
    section 47 of the 2006 Act.

3.    With  their  notice  of  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  Kumar
    Associates included a print-out of their client's CAS, which  had  been
    assigned on 14th May 2012, just before the application was made, and in
    the grounds of appeal it  was  contended  that  a  copy  of  this  'CAS
    statement' had been sent off  with  the  application  form.   When  the
    appeal came before Judge Hillis on 18th March 2013, he noted  that  the
    CAS reference number had indeed been written down  on  the  application
    form, and that the respondent was in error in supposing  that  the  CAS
    number had not been submitted with the application.  He noted also that
    the grounds of appeal included the contention that a copy  of  the  CAS
    statement had been enclosed with  the  application  form,  and  he  was
    surprised that the solicitors had not thought to submit a copy  of  the
    CAS with their notice of appeal.  In his view, they  had  not  rebutted
    the respondent's contention that  the  CAS  was  not  attached  to  the
    application.  Judge Hillis therefore dismissed  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules and, as it had also been claimed that the refusal  to
    vary the appellant's leave was a breach of his  Article  8  rights,  he
    also dismissed the appeal in respect of the human rights claim.

4.   Being under the impression that  the  'reconsideration'  procedure  was
    still   in   force,   Kumar   Associates   submitted    'Grounds    for
    Reconsideration', in which they  pointed  out  that  Judge  Hillis  had
    failed to spot the CAS at pages 17-20  of  the  bundle  containing  the
    notice of appeal.  Despite that, when  Judge  Pooler  considered  these
    grounds, he complained that they "do not identify any  documents  which
    the judge failed to take into account", and concluded that no  arguable
    error of law had been disclosed.

5.   The same grounds (with the  addition  of  a  reference  to  K1  of  the
    application form) were now submitted directly to  the  Upper  Tribunal,
    and fared better before  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Perkins,  who  granted
    permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.   When  the  matter  came
    before me today, I drew attention to the CAS, which did  indeed  appear
    at pages 17-20 of the  bundle  comprising  the  notice  of  appeal  and
    accompanying documents.  It is astonishing that it  was  overlooked  by
    Judge Hillis and again by Judge  Pooler,  even  when  the  Grounds  for
    Reconsideration had pointed out where to find it.  To overlook material
    evidence is certainly an error of law.  Miss Isherwood,  on  the  other
    hand, argued that the CAS was not admissible as evidence under  section
    85A of the 2002 Act, if it had not been included with the  application,
    and was only adduced for the first time before the Tribunal.   Although
    the Respondent's Bundle in the present case  had  only  reproduced  the
    application form and Mr Abraham's passport, Miss Isherwood was able  to
    extract  from  the  Home  Office  file  all  the  documents  which  had
    accompanied the application.  These comprised all the  documents  which
    had been listed at page 30  of  the  form,  including  the  educational
    certificates and the bank statement, except for the CAS.  It simply was
    not there.

6.   For his part, Mr Earnest was sure that the CAS  would  have  been  sent
    off with the application form.  It seems to me very likely  that  Kumar
    Associates, who  completed  the  application  form  on  their  client's
    behalf, did have a copy of the CAS and did intend to send it.   One  of
    two things must have happened.  Either the CAS got mislaid and was  not
    put into the envelope posted to the Border Agency, or it was  put  into
    that envelope  and  got  mislaid  after  reaching  its  destination  in
    Sheffield.   It  was  not  before  the  caseworker  who  examined   the
    application.

7.   I cannot say which of  these  alternatives  is  the  likelier.   As  it
    happens, Miss Isherwood was able to demonstrate  that  the  appeal  was
    doomed to failure in any event.  Mr Earnest did not have a copy of  the
    bank  statement  which  accompanied  the  application  form,  but  Miss
    Isherwood produced the original from the Home  Office  file.   It  runs
    from 5th April to 10th May 2012, and at no point does it come  anywhere
    near the �1,600 which Mr Abraham needed to show for  a  28-day  period.
    If the caseworker  in  Sheffield  had  taken  that  point,  instead  of
    adopting the illogical argument that Mr Abraham  scored  0  points  for
    Maintenance because he scored 0  points  for  Attributes,  this  appeal
    would never have got off the ground.  If Kumar Associates are competent
    immigration lawyers, they must have realised, when  they  enclosed  the
    Halifax bank statement with the application, that the application would
    fall to be refused on Maintenance.  Perhaps they were  just  hoping  to
    buy time for their client.

8.   The upshot is that any error of law made by the First-tier Tribunal  is
    not material, as the appellant did  not  satisfy  the  requirements  of
    Appendix C to the Immigration Rules, regardless of whether he satisfied
    Appendix A.  Therefore the  appeal  was  rightly  dismissed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  Article 8 was not canvassed before  me  today,  and
    rightly so, because the contention  is  completely  hopeless.   On  the
    other hand, as Miss Isherwood readily accepted, the decision to  remove
    Mr Abraham was, as Ahmadi [2013] EWCA Civ 512 has  recently  confirmed,
    invalid.  It may be that Mr Abraham will wish to  make  representations
    to the Secretary of State, based on his current  circumstances,  before
    she makes another 'immigration decision' in his case.


     DECISION

     The First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  a  material  error  of  law  in
    dismissing the appeal against  the  refusal  to  vary  the  appellant's
    leave, and the appeal to the Upper Tribunal against  that  decision  is
    dismissed.

     But the appeal is allowed to the limited  extent  that  the  concurrent
    decision to remove the appellant under section 47 of  the  Immigration,
    Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 is not in accordance with the law.
