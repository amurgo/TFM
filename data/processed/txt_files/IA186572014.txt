For the Appellant:     Mr Ikie (Solicitor)
For the Respondent:    Mr Tarlow (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISIONS AND REASONS

 1. The appellant was formerly a citizen  of  Nigeria  but  then  became  a
    citizen of Sweden. On November 29, 2002 the appellant  was  issued,  in
    Nigeria, with a visit  visa  enabling  her  to  travel  to  the  United
    Kingdom. On March 5, 2004 the appellant was granted Swedish citizenship
    and was issued with a Swedish  passport  as  the  child  of  a  Swedish
    national. This was valid until January 29, 2007  and  was  subsequently
    renewed and extended until  January  29,  2012.  In  January  2012  she
    approached the Swedish Embassy to renew her passport  but  was  advised
    that before this could  be  done  she  had  to  renounce  her  Nigerian
    nationality. On January 25, 2012 she  attended  at  the  Nigerian  High
    Commission and was advised to make a written application  and  she  did
    this the following day. She then  approached  the  Swedish  Embassy  to
    complete the renewal of her passport but was then  told  that  she  had
    lost her citizenship for failing to submit an application, prior to her
    22nd birthday, proving she had close links  to  Sweden.  The  appellant
    submitted on April 29, 2013 an  application  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain on the grounds of ten years  lawful  residence.  The  respondent
    refused her application on December 9, 2013 and on December 18, 2013  a
    removal notice under section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act  1999
    was issued to her.

 2.  The  appellant  appealed  under  section  82(1)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on January 3, 2014 and the matter  came
    before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Kempton  (hereinafter  referred
    to as the "FtTJ") on November 26, 2014 and in a decision promulgated on
    December 12, 2014 he refused her appeal under  the  Immigration  Rules,
    EEA Regulations and human rights.

 3. The appellant lodged grounds  of  appeal  on  December  16,  2014.  She
    submitted the FtTJ erred primarily on three grounds namely  by  failing
    to find the appellant was stateless, failing to find the appellant  had
    already obtained permanent residence and consequently demonstrated  she
    had accrued ten years lawful residence  and  failing  to  consider  the
    claim under article 8 ECHR properly.

 4. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Osborne granted permission  to  appeal
    on January 28, 2015 although exact areas of error were not specifically
    identified.

 5. The appellant was present and was represented as set out above. My full
    record of Mr Ikie's submissions are recorded in the note of proceedings
    but for the purpose of this error of  law  determination  I  intend  to
    concentrate on two issues namely:

          a. Had the  appellant  obtained  permanent  residence  under  the
             Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 and if so was  it  possible
             for her to lose it?

          b. If she could demonstrate she had been here  lawfully  did  she
             satisfy the requirements of paragraph 276B HC 395.

 6. Mr Ikie argued that the appellant had been in the country  since  March
    2004 as a Swedish citizen and  had  produced  evidence  from  McDonalds
    dated September 17, 2007 that confirmed she commenced work on  May  25,
    2007 and a letter from HM Revenue and Customs dated  February  4,  2014
    that confirmed she had been economically active in tax years 2007 2012.



 7. She lost her Swedish citizenship on August 22, 2012 by which  time  she
    had been economically active for five years.

 8. Mr  Tarlow  considered  the  documents  submitted  in  the  appellant's
    additional bundle (pages  13  and  14)  and  agreed  that  the  records
    supported her claim  to  have  been  exercising  treaty  rights  for  a
    continuous period of five years and  consequently  Mr  Tarlow  did  not
    disagree with Mr Ikie's submission  that  she  had  obtained  permanent
    residence under Regulation  15  of  the  2006  Regulations.  Mr  Tarlow
    further agreed that she could only lose this right if  she  was  absent
    from the United Kingdom for  two  years  and  the  respondent  was  not
    asserting this.

 9. In those circumstances I was persuaded that  as  she  had  a  permanent
    right of residence and  consequently  had  demonstrated  she  had  been
    living here for ten years lawfully (since  March  2004)  the  FtTJ  had
    erred in refusing her appeal under the Immigration Rules. Mr Tarlow did
    not disagree with this conclusion and did not seek to  argue  that  the
    appellant did not meet the requirements of paragraph 276B HC 395.

10. I therefore found there had been an error in law and allowed her appeal
    under the Immigration Rules.

11.  The  citizenship/statelessness  issue  is  misconceived.  Whilst   the
    appellant had renounced her Nigerian citizenship and had been told  she
    could not have her Swedish passport renewed, Section 14 of the  Swedish
    Citizenship Act 2001 makes clear that the loss of  Swedish  citizenship
    does not apply if it would result in the person becoming  stateless.  I
    am therefore satisfied that Grounds A and B have no substance.  Grounds
    C to E are dealt with above and I make no finding on Ground F in  light
    of my finding on the main application.

    DECISION

12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did disclose an error in law. I
    set aside the decision and I allow the appeal under Paragraph  276B  of
    the Immigration Rules.

13. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction pursuant to
    Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and I see
    no reason to alter that order.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

No fee award is made because none was requested. If a request had been  made
I would not have made an award because documents supporting the appeal  were
submitted after the application had been submitted.
