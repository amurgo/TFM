                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellants:    Ms S Anzani, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The first appellant is an Indian national born  on  26  November  1988.
    The second appellant  is  his  wife  who  is  dependent  on  the  first
    appellant's application and appeal.

2.   The appellants appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge N M K Lawrence dismissing  the  appeal  of  the  first  appellant
    against the refusal of the respondent to grant him leave to  remain  in
    the UK as an entrepreneur.  The  second  appellant  was  named  as  his
    dependant in this application.

3.   The issue in this is stated by the judge as following at paragraph 4

     "4. In order to achieve points under 'Applicant  has  access  to  funds
             are required' the appellant has not [sic] has  to  demonstrate
             he has access to �50,000 to invest, with his team partner,  in
             the UK but he has [sic] also has to demonstrate that the funds
             are from a source or held in  an  account  of  an  institution
             listed  on  the  Financial  Conduct  Authorities  (hereinafter
             'FCA') website, thereby indicating it is regulated by FCA.  In
             the instant appeal the funds in question are to be provided by
             Nomisma  Venture  Capital  LLP.   The  respondent  found  that
             Nomisma  is  not  registered  with  the  FCA.   Further,   the
             respondent found that the offer from  Nomisma  is  couched  in
             conditional terms.  It  reads  I  (one)  hereby  confirm  that
             subject  to  prevailing  market  conditions  Nomisma   Venture
             Capital LLP will make available �50,000 for investment ..."

      The  respondent  found  this  conditional  offer  does  not  meet  the
    requirements.

4.   The judge's findings are as follows

              "My Findings

         9.   The appellant's  case  is  quite  simple.   He  relies  on  an
             'expert' report prepared by one Daniel  Tunkel.   This  report
             stipulates that Nomisma is 'connected to  a  regulated  entity
             Providentia Captial LLP  .....  Providentia  is  the  Managing
             Member of  Nomisma."   A  flow  chart  has  been  provided  to
             demonstrate the connection between  Providentia  and  Nomisma.
             The 'expert' slates that "(I)t seems to me to be  self-evident
             that  when  the  Immigration  Rules  refer  to  funding  being
             generated from 'one or  more  registered  venture  capitalists
             firms regulated by Financial Conduct  Authority  this  has  to
             refer  to  the  competence  of  a  regulated  firm   such   as
             Providentia to arrange for an entity like  Nomisma,  which  it
             manages, to make this funding available" (see: para 18 of  the
             report).


         10.  The relevant provisions in  Table  4  of  Appendix  A,  namely
             "(T)he applicant has access to not less than �50,000 from: (i)
             one or more registered venture capitalists firms (regulated by
             the FCA)."  The report does not dispute that Nomisma is itself
             registered with FCA but it is in turn managed  my  Providentia
             and that should be sufficient for  the  purposes  of  relevant
             Immigration Rule.  The wording of the relevant Rule  is  clear
             and, to me, is unambiguous.  It stipulates  that  the  venture
             capital firm itself must be registered and not must be managed
             by an entity registered with the FCA.  In my view, the wording
             of the relevant Rule does  not  bear  the  interpretation  the
             'expert' seeks to put on them.  I reject the expert's opinion.




         11.  The second point raised by the respondent is that the offer is
             conditional,  namely  'prevailing  market   conditions.'    Mr
             Hossain submits that the venture capitalist will itself decide
             when the conditions are met.  The relevant Rule does not  read
             "(T)he applicant has access to not less than �50,000 from  one
             or more registered venture capitalists, subject to  conditions
             stipulated  by  the  venture  capitalists."   On  simple   and
             straightforward constructions of the  words  in  the  relevant
             Rule indicates to me that the funds has [sic] to be  available
             to the applicant, without conditions, for him/her  to  invest.
             Accordingly, I find the appellant and his team member  has  no
             access to �50,000 to invest in the UK."


5.   Permission was granted on the following  basis  "it  is  arguable  that
    because the Rule is unclear the judge has misconstrued the relationship
    between the financial institutions involved and their regulatory body."
     Miss Anzani relied on her skeleton argument and the expert  report  by
    Daniel Tunkel. She submitted that it provided a clear  picture  of  the
    position of Nomisma in relation to its trade as a venture capital  firm
    as well as its FCA registration.  In her grounds she submitted that  it
    was confirmed in the expert report that Nomisma was in fact managed  by
    Providentia LLP ("Providential"), which  is  listed  as  on  the  FCA's
    register.  While it was accepted that Nomisma is not itself listed as a
    regulated entity, it was clear from the expert report that  Providentia
    clearly had a legal  commitment  to  manage  Nomisma  and  arrange  for
    Nomisma to make the venture capital funding available  and  that  Judge
    Lawrence failed to identify that.

6.   Miss Anzani submitted  that  the  judge  dismissed  the  expert  report
    without any explanation.  Since the case rests entirely on  the  expert
    report, it was incumbent on the judge to give reasons why  he  did  not
    accept  it.   Further,  she  argued  that  as  Nomisma  is  managed  by
    Providentia, it meets the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules.  She
    also argued that there is clearly an inconsistency  in  the  manner  in
    which the Home Office operates this Rule.  Some First-tier Judges  have
    allowed appeals of this kind and some have been dismissed by First-tier
    Judges.

7.   Mr Walker submitted that the Immigration Rule is clear and  unambiguous
    and that was why the judge  disregarded  the  expert  opinion  on  this
    point.

8.   He relied on the Rule 24 response.  It said "one  of  the  reasons  for
    the refusal of the appellant's application was that the Venture Capital
    firm  Nomisma  Venture  Capital  LLP  does  not  have  the  appropriate
    permission, and the Secretary of State was therefore  unable  to  award
    the required  points  for  Attributes.   Under  the  Immigration  Rules
    Venture Capital firms must be registered  with  the  Financial  Conduct
    Authority (FCA)  and  their  entry  in  the  register  must  include  a
    permission to arrange, deal in or  manage  investments,  or  to  manage
    alternative investment funds.  The First-tier Tribunal considered  this
    ground of refusal at paragraphs 9  and  10.   The  First-tier  Tribunal
    considered the evidence before, including the expert report prepared by
    Mr. Daniel Tunkel, before concluding that the appellant does  not  have
    access to the required  funds  from  one  or  more  registered  venture
    capital firms (regulated by the FCA).  Cogent and adequate reasons  are
    provided for that conclusions."

9.   Miss Anzani's second argument relied on the submission in her  skeleton
    argument that the judge erred in his interpretation of the  Immigration
    Rules and his understanding of the  relationship  between  Nomisma  and
    Providentia and the relevant regulatory law.  Mr Tunkel made clear that
    the FCA regulates managers of funds, not  the  funds  themselves.   The
    Immigration  Rules  require  a  Tier  1   Entrepreneur   applicant   to
    demonstrate that he has received funding from "one or  more  registered
    venture capitalist firms regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority."
    Ms Anzani submits that the Investment Management Agreement ("the  IMA")
    under the terms of which Nomisma's business is managed  by  Providentia
    means that this requirement  is  met.   Further,  that  an  alternative
    interpretation would mean "the Rule can never have any utility."   This
    would produce an absurd result and must, therefore, be  interpreted  in
    some other manner.

10.  My understanding of  the  alternative  argument  put  forward  by  Miss
    Anzani in her skeleton argument is that Mr Tunkel made  clear  the  FCA
    regulates managers of funds, not the funds themselves.  But,  according
    to paragraph 4 of the Rule 24 response,  under  the  Immigration  Rules
    venture capital firms must be registered with the FCA and  their  entry
    in the register must include a permission to arrange, deal in or manage
    investments, or to manage alternative investment funds.  The  appellant
    sought leave to remain in the UK as an entrepreneur  on  the  basis  of
    funds he was to receive directly from Nomisma.  It is not disputed that
    Nomisma is not a venture capital firm that is registered  by  the  FCA,
    albeit that it is managed by Providentia which  is  registered  by  the
    FCA.  Therefore, as Nomisma does not meet the  criteria  identified  in
    the respondent's Rule 24 response, in that it is not a venture  capital
    firm that  is  registered  with  the  FCA,  notwithstanding  that  it's
    managing member, Providentia, is registered with the FCA, it means that
    the appellant cannot succeed in this appeal as found by the judge.

11.  I find that the judge gave  reasons  why  he  disregarded  Mr  Tunkel's
    report.

12.  I note that the judge also  dismissed  the  appeal  because  the  funds
    being made available by Nomisma  were  conditional  on  market  forces.
    However, this particular refusal was not dealt with  in  Miss  Anzani's
    skeleton argument or in her oral arguments.

13.  I have not heard any further from the respondent  as  to  whether  this
    rule is applied inconsistently because of the different judgments being
    made by different judges.

14.  On the substantive issues, however, I find that the appellant's  appeal
    cannot succeed.  The  judge  did  not  err  in  law  and  his  decision
    dismissing the appellant's appeal shall stand.
