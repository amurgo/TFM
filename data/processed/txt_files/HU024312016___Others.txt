                                     and


               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Murphy, instructed by Farid Javani Taylor
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants appeal with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Rodger promulgated on 31  January  2017  dismissing
    their appeals against the  decisions  of  the  respondent  made  on  15
    January 2016 to refuse their human rights claims.

 2. Rule 40 (1) of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
    provided that the Upper Tribunal  may  give  a  decision  orally  at  a
    hearing. Ruled 40 (3) provides that the  Upper  Tribunal  must  provide
    written reasons for its decision with  a  decision  notice  unless  the
    parties have consented to the Upper Tribunal not giving written reasons
    which both Mr Murphy and Mr Walker did,  it  being  accepted  that  the
    judge had erred in her approach  to  the  best  interests  of  the  3rd
    appellant, it being unclear also what weight had been attached  to  his
    position as a qualifying child; and, that the judge  had  at  [78]  and
    [81] erred in failing to note that this is  not  an  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules. It is observed also that the decision is lacking  in
    proper structure.

 3. Accordingly, given the acceptance by the respondent that  none  of  the
    relevant findings could be preserved, and the lapse of time since those
    findings, and with the consent of the parties, I am satisfied that  the
    appeal should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and I set it aside. The appeal is  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a fresh decision on all issues.

 2. The appeal must not be listed before First-tier Tribunal Judge Rodger
