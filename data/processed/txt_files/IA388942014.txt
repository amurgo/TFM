For the Respondent:    Ms A Christie, Counsel, instructed by Bindmans LLP


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to  the  parties  as  they  were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Thus the Secretary of State is once more the Respondent, and
    Mr Jhahan is the Appellant.

 2. This is an appeal by the Respondent against the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge S J Clarke (the judge), promulgated on 14 November 2016,
    in which she allowed the Appellant's appeal.  That appeal arose from  a
    decision of the Respondent dated 9 October 2014, cancelling  his  leave
    to remain and refusing leave to enter.

 3. The Appellant had come to the United Kingdom some years previously as a
    student.  His last grant of leave to remain in the  same  category  ran
    from 26 March 2013 to 30 November 2015.   Upon  return  from  a  family
    holiday in Bangladesh the Appellant was stopped  at  port  and  in  his
    circumstances examined.  The Respondent alleged that  he  had  provided
    false English language test certificates and that as a result  of  this
    paragraph 321A of the Immigration Rules applied,  namely  that  he  had
    made false representations or submitted false documents in relation  to
    the application.

    The judge's decision

 4. The judge's findings and conclusions  begin  at  paragraph  10  of  her
    decision.  She notes at the outset that  there  were  discrepancies  as
    between the actual English language certificates and  the  Respondent's
    evidence provided in support of the allegation that the  Appellant  had
    practised deception.  The judge referred to the other evidence provided
    by the  Respondent  and  categorised  that  as  being  "generic"  (that
    evidence consisted of witness statements from Rebecca  Collings,  Peter
    Millington and Professor French).  She noted the absence  of  any  live
    witnesses for the Respondent despite there being a request for this  by
    the Appellant.

 5. The judge looked in detail at the nature  of  the  interview  conducted
    with the Appellant at port, and concludes that it was  conducted  in  a
    hostile manner at a time when the Appellant was particularly tired  and
    nervous.  As a result the judge specifically finds that no  weight  was
    to be placed upon apparent admissions made  by  the  Appellant  in  the
    course of that interview.

 6. The judge notes the absence of any particular evidence in  relation  to
    the  Appellant's  English  language  tests.  She  concludes  that   the
    Respondent has discharged the evidential burden.  She goes on  to  find
    that in securing his place  at  Hertfordshire  University  he  had  not
    submitted English language certificates as there was no need to do  so:
    that institution made  its  own  assessment  of  his  English  language
    ability.  The judge specifically finds that the Appellant had not  made
    false representations in respect of obtaining the CAS.

 7. At paragraph 30 the judge sets out  the  Appellant's  academic  history
    insofar as it was relevant to the  issue  of  his  proficiency  in  the
    English language.  Ultimately, the judge concludes that  the  Appellant
    had not been dishonest in any  respect  and  that  the  Respondent  had
    failed to discharge the legal burden resting upon her.

    The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 8. The grounds of appeal are very narrow in their remit.  They assert that
    the judge had not  provided  adequate  reasons  for  finding  that  the
    Respondent had failed to discharge  her  legal  burden.   Reliance  was
    placed on the generic evidence put before the judge  and  the  apparent
    admission made by the Appellant during the port interview.

 9. Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Parkes  on  3  May
    2017.







    The hearing before me

10. Prior to the hearing  I  had  carefully  considered  all  the  relevant
    materials on file including a Rule 24 response and a skeleton  argument
    prepared by Ms Christie.

11. At  the  outset  of  the  hearing  Ms  Ahmad  confirmed  that  she  was
    effectively conceding the appeal. She stated that she  could  not  rely
    upon the grounds of  appeal  in  this  case  and  was  not  making  any
    application to amend those grounds.

    Decision on error of law

12. In light of Ms Ahmad's position at the  hearing  I  conclude  that  the
    judge's decision contains no material errors of law and it shall stand.



13. I am bound to say that even if Ms Ahmad  had  sought  to  maintain  the
    grounds of appeal I would have no hesitation  in  concluding  that  the
    judge's findings and conclusions were entirely open to  her.   She  was
    fully entitled to take into account the absence of any  live  witnesses
    on the Respondent's behalf.  She was fully entitled  to  conclude  that
    the witness statements of Mr Millington and Ms Collings were generic in
    nature.   She  was  entitled  to  take  into  account  the  Appellant's
    impressive academic history and the relevance of that to his ability to
    speak English, and in turn the absence of any reason for  him  to  have
    cheated in respect of the English language tests.

14. She was  fully  entitled  to  take  into  account  the  fact  that  the
    Respondent's  own  evidence  contained  within  the  Lookup  Tool   was
    inconsistent with the actual certificates, thus rendering what specific
    evidence  there  might  have  been  on  the  Respondent's  part  to  be
    unreliable.  The judge was fully entitled to reach the finding that  no
    reliance should be placed upon the port interview.  That point, I note,
    had not been challenged in the grounds, a failure which is significant.

15. The judge was entirely  correct  in  finding  that  the  University  of
    Hertfordshire had in fact made his offer and provided the  CAS  on  the
    basis of their own assessment  of  the  Appellant's  ability  to  speak
    English.  She was correct in finding that the Appellant had not in fact
    submitted the TOEIC certificates when obtaining the CAS: there  was  no
    need to do so on the basis that the relevant institution was conducting
    its own assessment. The judge was fully entitled to find, as she did in
    paragraph 29, that the Appellant had not made false representations.

16. In light of what I have set  out  above,  not  only  were  the  judge's
    findings and conclusions open to her, but the grounds of appeal  lacked
    any merit whatsoever.  It  is  difficult,  for  my  part,  to  see  why
    permission to appeal was granted in the first place.

17. There is a further point here raised by Ms  Christie  in  her  Rule  24
    response  and  skeleton  argument.   The  Appellant  had  not  in  fact
    submitted any  of  the  language  test  certificates  when  making  his
    application in 2013.  As the judge found, the Appellant had been issued
    with a CAS based upon the University of Hertfordshire's own  assessment
    of his language abilities.  Further, there had been no application made
    when the Appellant sought to re-enter the  United  Kingdom  in  October
    2014; he had extant leave, and this acted as  entry  clearance.   As  a
    result of the foregoing it could not be said that paragraph 321A(2)  of
    the Immigration Rules applied at all.  Therefore, on any view  of  this
    case, the Respondent's challenge to the  judge's  decision  was  always
    bound to fail.

    Additional Comments

18. Ms Christie has asked me to include a number of additional comments  in
    my decision relating to what will happen next.  She has referred me  to
    paragraph 25 of her  skeleton  argument,  which  refers  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal decision in Mohibullah [2016] UKUT 00561 (IAC).  Ms Ahmad  has
    no objection for me including these  comments  in  my  decision.   What
    follows are not directions, but observations which I would  expect  the
    Respondent to take into account fully:

 i. If the Appellant makes a further application for leave to remain  by  7
    August 2017 the Secretary of State  shall  treat  that  application  as
    having been made in time, in other words, at a time when the  Appellant
    had leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 Student;

ii. The Secretary of State shall waive the requirement that  the  Appellant
    must be applying for leave to remain for the purpose of  studies  which
    commence within 28 days;

iii. Should the Secretary of State  refuse  that  application  on  the  sole
    ground that she considers that the Appellant obtained  his  2012  TOEIC
    certificates by deception then that will not be taken into  account  in
    relation to the sponsoring university's refusal rate for the purpose of
    Tier 4 sponsorship requirements;

iv. The Secretary of State shall not refuse any further application by  the
    Appellant for leave to remain in the United Kingdom by reason  only  of
    his not having had leave to remain  between  30  November  2015  and  7
    August 2017.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal's decision does not contain any material  errors  of
law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.

The appeal of the Secretary of State to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
