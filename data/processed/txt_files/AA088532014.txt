                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

1.    The appellant, a national of Afghanistan,  has  appealed  against  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal of  26  May  2015  to  dismiss  his
    appeal against the respondent's  decision  to  refuse  him  asylum  and
    remove him from the United Kingdom.

2.    The appellant is male and arrived illegally in the United  Kingdom  to
    claim asylum on 26 January 2010.  He gave his date of birth as  1  July
    1976.  His application for asylum was refused on 19 March  2010  but  h
    was given discretionary leave to remain until 1 March 2013.  No  appeal
    against that decision was made.  He applied for further leave to remain
    on 14 March 2013.  On  13  October  2014  the  respondent  refused  his
    application for asylum, humanitarian protection and under ECHR.

3.    The appellant claimed  that  his  father  had  been  abducted  by  the
    Taliban, was released after about a month and then  proceeded  to  work
    for  them.   After  some  time  the  appellant's  father  informed  the
    appellant that the Taliban wanted the appellant to  join  the  Taliban.
    The appellant's mother was unhappy with that arrangement.   Six  police
    officers came to his house and  asked  about  the  whereabouts  of  the
    appellant's father.  The following day they returned and the  appellant
    was assaulted with a butt of a gun which broke the appellant's arm.  He
    thereafter fled and was handled  by  an  agent  who  took  him  out  of
    Afghanistan in a lorry.

4.    The appellant was  subjected  to  a  screening  in  January  2010  and
    substantive interview in February 2010.  The respondent did not  accept
    that the appellant was at risk in Afghanistan or that his father was  a
    member of the Taliban.  She did not accept that the  appellant  had  to
    flee as a result of a police raid  on  his  house.   At  the  screening
    interview on 26 January 2010 the appellant  claimed  to  have  been  13
    years and 5 months old placing his date of  birth  at  about  1  August
    1996.

5.    An age assessment was carried  out  on  18  December  2009  which  had
    assessed his date of birth as being 1 July  1995,  about  seven  months
    older than the appellant claimed to be.

6.    The First-tier Tribunal heard evidence from the appellant and it  also
    had a witness statement from him dated 14 February 2014.  In a skeleton
    argument before the  First-tier  Tribunal  counsel  for  the  appellant
    argued that the appellant's evidence was supported by the fact that  he
    had entered the United Kingdom with his arm in a  sling  and  that  the
    evidence of Dr Juistozi, in a report in the  appellant's  supplementary
    bundle, corroborated the appellant's claim.  In relation to Article  8,
    reference was made to R (AA) Afghanistan v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 1643, a
    Court of Appeal case,  which  addressed  the  position  in  respect  to
    restitution for incorrect age assessment.

7.    It was  argued  that  the  screening  and  substantive  interviews  in
    January and February 2010  had  to  be  viewed  in  the  light  of  the
    appellant's true age at that time which was approximately 13 years  and
    5  months.   In  view  of  the  respondent's  policy  in   respect   of
    unaccompanied asylum seeking children (UASC)  the  appellant  ought  to
    have been granted discretionary leave until he was 17� years of age and
    on that basis the period of discretionary ought to have  expired  on  1
    March 2014.  Instead, his period of discretionary leave  expired  on  1
    March 2013 on the basis of an incorrect age assessment.

8.    That had caused "gross procedural unfairness" and in terms of  R  (AA)
    Afghanistan he was entitled to restitution.

9.    At paragraph 22 of the determination of the  First-tier  Tribunal  the
    question of the appellant's age is dealt with.  The judge was  prepared
    to accept that the appellant's date of birth was as claimed in July  or
    August 1996.  He then proceeds as follows:

         "Thus at the time his asylum claim was first refused  on  19  March
         2010 he was aged 13 year and 8 or 9 months.  On this basis he would
         have  been  17  years  and  7  or  8  months  when  the  period  of
         discretionary leave expired on 1March 2013.  That is in  accordance
         with Home Office policy."

    Unfortunately, the penultimate sentence quoted contains a  mathematical
    error since the appellant would in fact have been 16 years and 7  or  8
    months when the period of discretionary leave expired on 1 March  2013.
    Accordingly, to  refuse  discretionary  leave  and  to  return  him  to
    Afghanistan when the period of discretionary leave expired on  1  March
    2013 would, in fact, have been contrary to Home Office policy.

10.   Having considered the evidence, the Tribunal rejected the  appellant's
    contention that his father was a member of the  Taliban  and  that  his
    home was raided by the police.  It was not accepted that he was at risk
    in Afghanistan from the authorities, the Taliban, or from his father.

11.   The Tribunal recognised that at  the  time  of  the  First  Tribunal's
    hearing the appellant was over 18 and  therefore  no  longer  a  minor.
    Reference was made to KA (Afghanistan) and Others v  SSHD  [2012]  EWCA
    Civ 1014 in which the Court of Appeal made it clear that the  Secretary
    of State's duty towards unaccompanied minors included a duty  to  trace
    family members and that was not discharged simply by giving them  leave
    until they reached the age of 17�.  A breach of that duty, however, did
    not automatically result in a successful appeal and a grant  of  asylum
    or indefinite leave to remain.  Some tangible disadvantage required  to
    be identified to the appellant which would have resulted in a grant  of
    asylum or humanitarian protection.  In EU and Others [2013] EWCA Civ 32
    the Court of Appeal stated that an appellant had to show  that  on  the
    particular facts there was a causative link between  the  Secretary  of
    State's breach of duty and the claimant's claim  for  protection.   The
    Tribunal did not find any such causative link in the current  case  nor
    did they find any prejudice that would render it unfair now  to  remove
    the appellant to Afghanistan (see R (on the application of  Jabarkhail)
    v SSHD [2013] EWHC 1798 (Admin)).  In respect of his being returned  to
    Afghanistan he had his parents and other relatives there.  Since he had
    only been in the UK for 5 years his cultural and linguistic  ties  were
    Afghanistan.  Notwithstanding the fact that he was just over  18 years
    of age, he was fit and well and could get support in Afghanistan.   The
    Tribunal concluded that the wrong age assessment  had  not  caused  him
    prejudice.  The decision  to  refuse  his  claim  for  asylum  was  not
    disproportionate.

12.   In respect of his Article 8 claim it was accepted that  the  appellant
    had established private  life  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  that  the
    decision to remove him interfered  with  his  right  to  private  life.
    However, in balancing the competing interests of the appellant and  the
    respondent's duties and obligations  to  the  community  at  large  the
    Tribunal found that the balance fell in favour of  the  respondent  and
    that his decision to return the appellant to Afghanistan was lawful and
    proportionate.

13.   The appellant appealed to the  Upper  Tribunal  upon  the  basis  that
    various points which had not been put to the appellant and which  would
    have been relevant in respect of findings of fact made were not put  to
    him and that had caused such unfairness as amounted to a material error
    of law.  Further, the Tribunal's acceptance that the  appellant's  date
    of birth was in August or July 1996 together with the finding that  the
    appellant was 17 years or 7 or 8 months at the expiry of  discretionary
    leave in March  2013  was  wrong  and  the  fact  that  he  was  denied
    entitlement to discretionary leave in line with the Home Office  policy
    was a further material error and the appellant entitled to  restitution
    therefore.  Accordingly that factor, which was not taken  into  account
    in the overall proportionality exercise under Article 8,  rendered  the
    removal disproportionate.  Accordingly, the Article 8 claim ought to be
    allowed.

14.   Mr Chelvan for the appellant advanced his argument  primarily  on  the
    second ground of appeal.  He referred to  AA  (Afghanistan)  where  the
    Appeal Court at paragraph 21 referred to Morris Kay LJ's judgment in KA
    (Afghanistan) [2012] EWCA Civ 1014 at paragraph 46.  There Lord Justice
    Kay refers to the need to provide some sort of causative  link  between
    the Secretary of State's breach of duty and a claim to protection.   At
    paragraph 47 his Lordship emphasised that there is a burden of proof on
    the applicant not simply to establish the failure to discharge  a  duty
    (in that case the duty of tracing relatives in the country  of  return)
    but also that he is entitled to that which he seeks.

15.   At paragraph 10 in AA (Afghanistan) Lord Justice Laws emphasised  that
    no relief or remedy  for  a  breach  of  policy  on  the  part  of  the
    respondent can be given unless the appellant can point to an  error  of
    law by the Secretary of State.  He defined at  paragraph  13  the  real
    question in that case as being whether it could be said that,  even  if
    there was no specific legal wrong in the Secretary  of  State  deciding
    the case when she did, nevertheless in the events  which  had  happened
    there was a legal duty to recognise in the substance  of  the  decision
    complained of that the appellant had lost or may have  lost  "potential
    benefits by virtue of his being over 18 at the time of decision".

16.   In the result, the  decision  complained  of  ought  in  law  to  have
    proceeded on "a  notional  basis"  that  the  appellant  was  under  18
    (paragraph 29).  In those circumstances the  court  declared  that  the
    Secretary of State was obliged to consider whether, in the light of the
    position as it ought to have been if the case had been  decided  before
    the appellant reached 18, some order should now be made in his favour.

17.   Mr Chelvan argued that was a clear breach of the  Home  Office  policy
    in this case.  The appellant had not received  discretionary  leave  to
    remain until he was 17�.  The consequences of  that  were  not  clearly
    articulated but appeared to be that the appellant would or  might  have
    been given another substantive interview some time later than  February
    2010 had he been granted discretionary leave until March 2014.  In that
    event his account of his fear of persecution  may  have  been  assessed
    differently.  In any event, he was denied a year's discretionary  leave
    to which, under Home Office policy, he was entitled.

18.   Mr Chelvan also pointed out  that  that  policy  involved  recognition
    that unaccompanied children  should  not  be  returned  to  their  home
    country unless  there  are  adequate  reception  arrangements  in  that
    country it is for that reason the duty of  making  enquiries  to  trace
    relatives in the home country exists.  Indeed, as  pointed  out  in  AA
    (Afghanistan) at paragraph 23 tracing  enquiries  are  central  to  the
    resolution of claims by a UASC.  In this case  the  result  of  tracing
    enquiries had not been known at the date of the decision but  reference
    was made to a letter dated 21 May 2015 from the British Red Cross which
    stated that efforts to obtain information about the  relatives  of  the
    appellant in Afghanistan had been unsuccessful.

19.   Mr Melvin, on behalf of the respondent,  advanced  little  by  way  of
    rebuttal of the submissions advanced by the  appellant's  counsel.   He
    acknowledged that there had been a technical error on the part  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  He stated however, that  there  was  no  material
    prejudice  occasioned  by  that  error.   By  the  date  of  the  First
    Tribunal's hearing the appellant was, on any view, not a minor.

20.   Mr Melvin, however, did not make any  application  to  obtain  further
    instructions or assistance and did not move for any continuation of the
    hearing for that purpose.

21.   It is clear that the First-tier  Tribunal  fell  into  error  when  it
    concluded at paragraph 22 that the period of discretionary leave  which
    expired on 1 March 2013 was  in  accordance  with  Home  Office  policy
    because the appellant would have been over 17 at that  time.   That  is
    plainly incorrect since he would,  on  the  findings  of  the  Tribunal
    itself, been only 16 years and 7 or 8 months.  Accordingly, the refusal
    of further discretionary leave amounts to a breach of the policy of the
    Home Office to which we have  referred.   Applying  the  same  sort  of
    reasoning as the Appeal Court did in AA (Afghanistan), we consider that
    there is a  legal  duty  to  recognise  that  the  decision  to  refuse
    discretionary leave on 13 October 2014 meant  that  the  appellant  may
    have lost potential benefits because it was thought at that  time  that
    he was one year older than he in fact has now been found to be  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  Had his true age been recognised  he  would  have
    been entitled to further leave to remain until March 2014.  As a result
    he may have been re-interviewed and the credibility of his responses at
    that time would have had to  be  assessed  of  new.   Furthermore,  the
    decision to grant him discretionary leave to remain until only 1  March
    2013 was one which breached Home Office policy.  He ought to have  been
    granted that leave until 1 March 2014.

22.   In the circumstances it seems to us, in the light of  that  breach  of
    policy together with its potential consequences, right to grant  him  a
    remedy.  Accordingly, we consider that the appeal on Article 8  grounds
    ought to be allowed in order to give the appellant  an  opportunity  to
    make such further application as he considers appropriate and  for  the
    respondent  to deal with any such application in a regular  and  proper
    manner.  It is not necessary for us to express any view  on  the  first
    ground of appeal which is directed at the alleged failure to put to the
    appellant certain matters on which findings of fact were based.

23.   We accordingly allow the appeal.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
