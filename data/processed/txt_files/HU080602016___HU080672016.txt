For the Appellant:      Mr Al-Hadi, Stevjeme & Co
For the Respondent:     Mr G. Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting
                       Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




 1. The Appellants are both nationals of Jamaica. They are  respectively  a
    mother and daughter, who is now aged three.




    Anonymity Order

 2. The adult Appellant is  a  foreign  criminal  and  as  such  would  not
    ordinarily merit protection of her identity.  This  case  does  however
    turn, in large measure, on the involvement of the second appellant (LG)
     and her British siblings, who both remain minors. Having had regard to
    Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellants are granted anonymity.  No report of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly  identify  either  Appellant  nor  any
        member of their family.  This direction applies to, amongst others,
        both the Appellants and the Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with
        this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"






    Background and Matters in Issue before the First-tier Tribunal

 3. KH first arrived in the UK in June 1999. She was  in  possession  of  a
    valid visit visa and was then aged 18.  In approximately December  1999
    her child SJ was  brought  from  Jamaica  to  join  her  here.  KH  was
    subsequently arrested and charged with possession with intent to supply
    a Class A controlled drug (heroin). She  claimed  asylum,  asserting  a
    fear of the criminal elements who had lured her into the drug business.
    On the 13th April 2000 KH was convicted at Woolwich Crown Court of five
    counts of possession with intent to supply heroin and  sentenced  to  a
    total of 33 months' imprisonment, to be served concurrently.    On  the
    5th October 2000 she got  a  further  three  months,  consecutive,  for
    common assault. Her asylum claim was rejected and appeal dismissed.  KH
    was removed from the United Kingdom  on  the  23rd  January  2002.   SJ
    remained here, living with his maternal grandmother.


 4. On the 12th October 2002 KH illegally  entered  the  UK.    She  passed
    through immigration control by using a false identity.  She  was  given
    leave to enter until the 12th April 2003, presumably as a visitor.   KH
    remained in the UK.   She entered  into  a  relationship  with  British
    national FBC. In May 2006 her daughter S was born, and in June 2009 her
    son T was born. It is not in dispute that both of  these  children  are
    British and that at present they are living with the Appellants.

 5. In March 2010 KH made an application to the Home Office using her false
    identity. She was seeking leave to remain on human rights grounds.  She
    was granted three years Discretionary Leave.

 6. In June 2013 she made a further application but this time was  required
    to register her biometric  information.  When  she  did  so,  her  true
    identity, and the earlier convictions, were revealed.

 7. LG, the second appellant, was born in  March  2014.   FBC  is  not  her
    father. LG's father  is  believed  to  be  a  Jamaican  national  whose
    immigration status is unknown, and with whom she has no contact.

 8. On the 12th  November  2014  the  Respondent  served  notice  that  she
    intended to deport KH on the grounds that her presence in  the  UK  was
    not conducive to the public good. On the 10th January 2016  a  decision
    was made to deport LG as the  family  member  of  a  person  liable  to
    deportation.  Representations were made on  human  rights  grounds  but
    these were rejected in a 'decision to  refuse  a  human  rights  claim'
    dated 14th March 2016.

 9. It was against the latter  decision  that  these  linked  appeals  were
    brought to the  First-tier  Tribunal.    There  has  to  date  been  no
    deportation order signed. The matter came  before  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Morris on the 13th July 2016.





    The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal


10. The Respondent's position before the First-tier Tribunal was  that  the
    KH had committed a serious crime, for which she had been  sentenced  to
    33 months imprisonment. This  brought  her  within  the  ambit  of  the
    automatic deportation provisions and (although a deportation order  had
    not in fact been signed) it was in the  public  interest  that  she  be
    removed from the UK.   By virtue of paragraph 398(b) of  the  Rules  KH
    could successfully resist deportation by showing one  or  more  of  the
    'exceptions' at paragraphs 399 and 399A of the rules applied.   It  was
    agreed between the parties that the only one of the  'exceptions'  that
    could possibly apply to KH was that set out at paragraph 399(a):

         399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c) applies
         if -
         (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship
         with a child under the age of 18 years who is in the UK, and
         (i) the child is a British Citizen; or
         (ii) the child has lived in the UK continuously for at least the 7
         years immediately preceding the date of the immigration decision;
         and in either case
         (a) it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in the country
         to which the person is to be deported; and
         (b) it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain in the UK
         without the person who is to be deported;


    It being accepted that KH had two children living in the UK  who  might
    potentially engage this  exception[1],  the  Tribunal  was  invited  to
    consider that issue.

11. The First-tier Tribunal accepted, as did the Respondent, that KH had  a
    genuine and subsisting parental relationship  with  S  and  T,  British
    citizens who were at the date of the appeal aged 10 and 7  respectively
    [see �62]. It then turned to consider whether it could be  demonstrated
    that it would be "unduly harsh" for the children to go to Jamaica  with
    their mother, and for it to be "unduly harsh" for them to  remain  here
    without her if she were to be  deported.   In  doing  so  the  Tribunal
    directed itself to take the approach set out by the Upper  Tribunal  in
    KMO (section 117 - unduly harsh) Nigeria [2015] UKUT 00543.


12. The Tribunal reminded itself that KH had  been  found  guilty  of  five
    counts of supplying heroin. It was satisfied that  these  were  serious
    offences and that weighed against  the  impact  on  the  children,  the
    consequences of her deportation  could  not  be  said  to  be  "unduly,
    inordinately or excessively harsh".  The Tribunal found that as British
    citizens S and T can remain living in the  UK.   Their  father  FBC  is
    living in Leeds. He speaks to the children on the phone and visits them
    at their home in Manchester when he can. They stay with him during  the
    holidays.  The Tribunal notes "no evidence was presented to me  to  the
    effect that it would not be possible for him  to  provide  a  home  for
    these children" [at   �66].   The  children  would  receive  additional
    support  from  their  grandmother,  aunt  and  uncle.    The   Tribunal
    considered that it might be possible for these relatives to provide  an
    alternative home for the children. It then says this:


         "In this connection, it is appropriate that I should record that in
         his closing submissions, the Appellant's representative raised, for
         the first time, that their father [FBC] had suffered a  stroke  and
         was incapable of providing a home for his children, and showed me a
         photograph of a man who appeared to be  in  hospital.  I  heard  no
         evidence to that effect. Indeed, I repeat that the evidence of  the
         Appellant was to the contrary regarding the contact he has had with
         his children as set out above. She  made  no  mention  of  any  ill
         health.  That  said,  since  the  hearing,  I  have  noted  in  the
         Appellant's bundle of documents a  letter  from  a  Dr  Blatherwick
         dated 8 June 2016 in which she states of  [FBC]  "he  is  still  an
         inpatient in the Stroke Unit at the LGI, and he will likely  be  an
         inpatient for a further two-three months". The letter  was  neither
         drawn to my attention nor relied upon at the hearing in any way".


    Having found that the children could live with their father,  or  other
    relatives, the appeal was thereby dismissed.




    The Appeal

13. On the 8th February 2017 I heard submissions on  whether  the  decision
    contained an 'error of law' and should therefore be set aside.


14. The grounds of appeal are straightforward. It is submitted that it  was
    irrational and/or otherwise unlawful for the Tribunal to disregard  the
    evidence of FBC's incapacity. The fact that none of the  witnesses  had
    been asked questions about it was irrelevant given  that  the  evidence
    was plainly in the bundle, and was expressly relied  upon  at  hearing.
    It is further submitted that the  alternative  arrangements  suggested,
    that the  children  could  live  with  another  family  member,  was  a
    suggestion unexplored in the evidence. None of those family members had
    volunteered to look after the children, they had not been  asked  about
    that possibility and there had been no assessment of their  suitability
    to do so. The Appellants submit that the "unduly harsh" assessment had,
    as a starting point, to involve a lawful appraisal  of  the  children's
    welfare. It was only once that assessment had been conducted  that  the
    Tribunal could proceed to  weigh  against  those  findings  the  public
    interest in the removal of KH.


15. I do not need to address these grounds in  any  great  detail  save  to
    record that they were accepted as made out in  their  entirety  by  the
    Respondent.   I find this to have  been  a  concession  properly  made.
    There was evidence before the Tribunal relating to the illness of  FBC,
    not just in the form  of  the  letter  from  Dr  Blatherwick,  but  for
    instance in the statement of  S1:  "Recently  my  sister's  father  has
    suffered from a stroke and as he  is  still  in  a  critical  state  my
    siblings really only have my mum to  depend  upon".    The  finding  at
    paragraph 66 of the determination that there was "no evidence" that FBC
    would be unable to provide a home for these children was  not  strictly
    speaking correct, since there was evidence before the Tribunal that  he
    had  suffered  a  stroke,  remained  hospitalised  and  in  a  critical
    condition.   As for the alternative arrangements suggested, namely that
    the children could live with their grandmother, aunt  or  uncle,  there
    was certainly no evidence to that effect.  If that was to be considered
    as a viable care plan for these children, it had  to  be  explored  and
    evaluated in light of s55 of the Borders, Citizenship  and  Immigration
    Act 2009.

16. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal was therefore set aside.



    The Re-Made Decision

17. As the chronology set out above illustrates, in the case  of  KH,  this
    was an appeal against a human rights decision. KH was notified that the
    Secretary of State for the Home Department  had  taken  a  decision  to
    deport her (not in itself an appealable decision) and invited  to  give
    reasons as to why she should not  be  deported.  These  representations
    were treated as a human rights application, which were refused. This is
    the decision under appeal. Mr Harrison informed me that no  deportation
    order has to date been made. It is unclear whether there  was  actually
    an order signed in 2002: if there was, I have  not  seen  it,  and  the
    Respondent  has  at  no  stage  treated  KH's  representations  as   an
    application for revocation.


18. This rather confused legal picture notwithstanding,  the  parties,  and
    the First-tier Tribunal, have all proceeded  on  the  basis  that  this
    should be treated as a deportation appeal: KH is a 'foreign  criminal',
    she is liable to deportation,  and  those  facts  underpin  the  public
    interest in her removal.   Paragraphs  398-399A  of  the  Rules  should
    therefore be the starting point in the assessment of her  human  rights
    appeal.  It was further agreed that the  matters  weighing  against  KH
    were not confined to her criminal convictions (5 counts  of  possession
    of heroin and intent to supply, a single count of assault). It was  not
    disputed that  KH  had  an  appalling  immigration  history,  including
    prolonged deception in the assumption of a false identity, the use of a
    national insurance number to which she was not  entitled,  and  working
    illegally.  These were matters that had to be weighed  in  the  balance
    when considering the tests in  paragraph  399(a),  ie.  when  assessing
    whether KH's deportation would have  an  unduly  harsh  impact  on  her
    British children:  MM (Uganda)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2016] EWCA Civ 450.


19. There is no dispute that  the  second  appellant,  S  and  T  all  live
    together  with  their  mother,  and  have  done  so  since  birth.  The
    Respondent accepts that S and T are both minors (they are currently  11
    and 8 respectively), and  that  they  have  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with their mother.   It is further accepted  that
    since they are both British, they are "qualifying children" as  defined
    by s117D(1)(a) of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  (as
    amended).

20. There are two distinct limbs to paragraph 399(a).   In order for KH  to
    succeed  in  her  appeal  she  must  satisfy  me,  on  a   balance   of
    probabilities, that it would be unduly harsh for the children  to  live
    without her in the United Kingdom, and that it would  be  unduly  harsh
    for S and T to leave the UK and travel to Jamaica.

21. LG has been served with a decision to deport pursuant to  s.3(5)(b)  of
    the Immigration Act 1971. That provides:

          (5) A person who is not a British citizen is liable to deportation
         from the United Kingdom if-

         (a) the Secretary of State deems his deportation to be conducive to
         the public good; or

         (b ) another person to whose family he belongs is or has been
         ordered to be deported.



22. There has of course been no deportation order signed. KH  has  not,  at
    least not since she became LG's mother,  been  deported.    Mr  Al-Hadi
    however took no issue  with  the  legality  of  the  decision.  He  was
    apparently happy to proceed on the basis that  LG's  appeal  stood  and
    fell with her mother's, and advanced no  discrete  submissions  on  her
    behalf.   That is therefore the approach that I shall take. I note that
    MacDonald[2]  cites  the  Court  of  Appeal  authority  of  Ibrahim   v
    Immigration Appeal Tribunal [1989] Imm AR 111 (CA) to the  effect  that
    s3(5)(b) should be given a broad interpretation:
         "The power can be exercised where a decision to deport has been
         taken against the head of the family. No actual deportation order
         is necessary".
    The Evidence

23. I heard oral evidence from KH.   She  adopted  her  witness  statements
    dated 11th June 2016 and 6th May 2017.  Her account is as follows.


24. KH was born in Kingston, Jamaica in 1980.  As a teenager  she  met  and
    formed a relationship with a boy who lived locally. In 1996 she  became
    pregnant with his child.  Shortly before the baby was due her boyfriend
    was shot dead.   In her oral evidence KH told me that where they  lived
    there had been a lot of gang warfare. He had not been directly involved
    but had come from the 'wrong street'. He was shot dead in his own home.
    KH's first child, SJ, was born in Kingston in  November  1996.  KH  was
    afraid for her and her child's safety, and resolved to leave the  area.



25. In February 1999 KH's mother came to the UK.  She sent for KH  and  SJ.
    KH explained that when her mother sent her the money for the ticket she
    had thought that she and SJ could both travel on one ticket, because he
    was on her passport. When she realised that she had to leave him behind
    she arranged for him to be cared for by a friend. She arrived in the UK
    in June, with the immediate aim of raising the funds to bring  her  son
    here to join her.   KH was given leave to enter the UK for 6 months  as
    a visitor[3].  She went to live in Nottingham with her mother.

26. KH explained that she had not long been here when she was introduced to
    someone who suggested that she could make money by doing "some selling"
    for him. The selling in question involved KH being supplied  with  pre-
    wrapped bags of heroin and a mobile phone. She  was  told  that  people
    would call her and  arrange  collection.  She  explained  in  her  oral
    evidence that the bags sold for between �10 and �20, depending on size.
      She did not directly keep the money, she was required to pass  it  on
    to the man who was supplying her with the bags. He would then pay her a
    'wage'.  She was open  for  business  every  day.  How  much  she  sold
    depended on whether the phone rang. Some days she  sold  nothing,  some
    days she had up to 15 customers. She  did  this  for  4-5  months.  She
    stopped because she was caught.   She  had  however  succeeded  in  her
    objective of obtaining enough money to bring  SJ  to  the  UK.  He  was
    brought to the UK in September 1999. After KH  was  arrested  he  lived
    with her mother in Nottingham.

27. KH was convicted on the 13th April 2000 and sentenced  to  prison.   In
    October 2000 she received a further conviction, for common assault. She
    told me that this arose from a fight that she had  with  another  woman
    whilst she was in prison.   KH claimed asylum during this  period.  She
    tried to avoid deportation by claiming a fear of the gangs in her  home
    area. This was rejected and she was removed  from  the  UK  in  January
    2002.

28. On the 12th October 2002 KH came back to the UK. She  gained  leave  to
    enter using someone else's passport. After her arrival she assumed that
    identity.  She obtained a national insurance number, and did care work.
    She met FBC in Nottingham and had a brief relationship  with  him.   In
    2005 they met again and got back together. She and SJ moved to Leeds to
    live with him. In May 2006 S was born. T was born in June 2009.    They
    all lived together as a family unit until September 2011  when  KH  and
    FBC split up.   After the children were born KH gave up the  care  work
    and was supported financially by TBC, who always worked.

29. In the period immediately after  the  relationship  ended  KH  and  the
    children lived close by to FBC in Leeds. The three  children  continued
    to see him on a regular, if not daily basis.   In November 2012 KH  and
    the children moved to Manchester. From this point on S and T would  see
    their father every other weekend and often in the holidays. They  would
    go on the train to Leeds and he would also come to  Manchester  to  see
    them. They continued to have a close and loving relationship with  him.
     This continued until he had a devastating stroke, on  the  15th  April
    2016.

30. KH told me that  both  children  have  been  badly  affected  by  their
    father's illness. S has  become  withdrawn  and  anxious.  KH  recently
    received a telephone call from a teacher at school who said that S  had
    broken down at school and that she had had a long talk with  her  about
    the stresses she was facing at home.  S  expressed  concern  about  her
    mother facing removal, and said that she is very distressed  about  her
    father's condition. She hates seeing him in a wheelchair and  finds  it
    very upsetting when she can't understand what he  is  saying.  KH  said
    that FBC's speech is improving now but it is still  hard  to  make  out
    what he is saying, particularly on the telephone.   S  has  been  doing
    well at school generally and  is  due  to  start  secondary  school  in
    September.  T's behaviour has also changed. He  was  quite  settled  at
    school previously but now he does not play like he used to and  he  has
    told KH that he is very worried.   His  school  have  referred  him  to
    CAMHS[4] for support.  He has been "lashing out"  at  school  and  they
    have expressed concerns about his behaviour.

31. The children continue to live with KH and their  elder  brother  SJ  in
    Manchester. SJ is now 21 years old. KH said that he has  a  very  close
    relationship with his brother and sister. SJ has  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in the UK and intends to remain living here.

32. The family have other family  members  in  this  country.  KH  has  her
    mother, step-father, sister and brother who all live in Nottingham. Her
    brother has two children who live with their mother. KH said  that  she
    and the children do see these relatives on a  regular  basis,  but  not
    often.   The children probably see their grandmother  the  most,  about
    once per month when she comes to  Manchester.    KH's  mother  has  got
    indefinite leave to remain, and has just applied  to  naturalise  as  a
    British citizen. Her sister and brother both have ILR.

33. KH said that she has very little connection with Jamaica now. She  does
    still have friends there but she has not seen them for many years.  She
    has relatives, but these are all distant. All of her close  family  are
    either in the UK, or the United  States  of  America.    Since  leaving
    Jamaica in 2002 KH has returned there twice. In summer 2010 she and FBC
    took the children for four week holiday  to  meet  FBC's  parents.  His
    father has since passed away. His mother is still  there  but  she  has
    only ever met her grandchildren twice; one on that trip, and once  when
    she came to visit the UK.   KH does not keep in touch with her. KH also
    visited Jamaica in September of that year. Her brother had been  living
    in America and had fallen ill and died; she went for one week in  order
    to attend his funeral.

34. In respect of her offending, KH  told  me  that  she  has  nothing  but
    regret. She wishes that she could take the whole thing back  and  start
    over. She was young but she does not regard that as an excuse. She  now
    understands the very detrimental effect that hard drugs such as  heroin
    have on the individuals who use them, and on how that can  impact  upon
    society as a whole.

35. I was given statements in  support  of  the  appeals  by  KH's  mother,
    sister, brother, stepfather and adult son. All aver that S  and  T  are
    happy and settled in the UK, that SH is a good  mother  and  that  they
    have nothing to return to in Jamaica.

36. I have been shown a letter from School Liason Officer at the children's
    primary school. It is dated 20th April 2017 and states that it  is  the
    school's view that it would be in  the  children's  best  interests  to
    remain with their mother. It reads:


         "The  children  are  settled  here  in  Manchester  and  have  been
         attending this school since 01.10.2015. [T] is having  difficulties
         with his behaviour and has been referred to CAMHS to  gain  support
         with this. Mum has worked with school and is very approachable  and
         we have built a good relationship with her.  [KH]  brings  [LG]  to
         Play and Stay and is a proactive member of the group. I  would  say
         [KH] has her children's best interests at  heart  and  to  separate
         them would be detrimental to her and the children, particularly [T]
         at this time when he needs stability".

37. Mr Al-Hadi further relies on an updated letter from the clinicians with
    care of FBC. On the 7th April  2017  Dr  Elizabeth  Iveson,  Consultant
    Stroke Physician at the Christchurch Neurological Rehabilitation Centre
    has written in the following terms:

         "[FBC]  has  had  a  stroke  which  has   affected   his   balance,
         coordination and speech. He has made some progress  with  intensive
         neurological rehabilitation but is still requiring  the  assistance
         of 2 people to transfer from bed to chair, he requires  help  of  2
         people to wash and dress and is unable to make meals independently.


         He is likely to be receiving inpatient neurological  rehabilitation
         for another 3 months, the future aim is for him to be discharged to
         his home environment in Leeds with a care package. [FBC]  has  been
         referred for 2 carers 4 times per day to  help  with  his  personal
         cares. He is not in a position to look after his own  children  and
         is unlikely to be so in the future. His mood is very  variable  and
         is affected by the thought of not seeing his children on a  regular
         basis".

    My Findings


38. I begin by considering the best interests of the  British  children  at
    the heart of these linked appeals.


39. I am satisfied, having regard to the evidence of  Dr  Iveson,  that  it
    would not be possible, or at least it would be  extremely  undesirable,
    for these children to live with their father.   He is very unwell,  and
    requires the care of others.  She believes it to be  unlikely  that  he
    would be in a position to look after the children  in  the  future.  It
    would not be appropriate for me to go behind that medical opinion.  The
    reality is that life with father, for S at  least,  would  very  likely
    result in her taking on a caring role. That would be wholly contrary to
    her best interests.

40.  The  children  could,  with  considerable  difficulty  and   financial
    constraints, go and live with grandma in Nottingham. There has been  no
    social services assessment of that household, but presumably this could
    be arranged.  They do not have the  room,  but  presumably  they  could
    move.  They do not have the money  to  look  after  two  children,  but
    presumably they  could  claim  benefits.  None  of  these  adults  have
    confirmed that they would be willing  to  take  on  the  children,  but
    presumably they could be persuaded to do so. Mr  Harrison  reminded  me
    that grandma did look after SJ when KH was in prison,  and  that  today
    she has the benefit of her husband, daughter and son all  close  by  to
    support her.   I have therefore considered this as an alternative  care
    arrangement.   The children obviously know these  family  members,  and
    have grown up with regular contact with them. They see  their  maternal
    grandma approximately once a month and I have no reason to suppose that
    they have anything other than a warm and loving relationship with  her.
      Whilst I accept that  there  would  be  a  series  of  financial  and
    practical difficulties in the children going to live with these  family
    members in Nottingham, I am satisfied that it would be possible.

41. I am not satisfied that moving to live with grandma would however be in
    their best interests. These are  children  who  have  faced  some  very
    challenging life  events.  Their  parents  split  up  with  they  were,
    respectively, 5 and 2.   Their father suffered  his  stroke  when  they
    were 9 and 6. It is clear  from  KH's  evidence  (uncontested  on  this
    point) as well as the evidence of the school, that seeing their  father
    transformed from a healthy adult into someone entirely dependent on the
    care of others has been a very  traumatic  experience  for  them  both.
    The  school  has  emphasised  the  need  for  stability,  and  in   the
    circumstances I consider that to be is self-evident.

42. KH has been their carer since birth, they have always  lived  with  her
    and there is no reason to believe that she is  anything  other  than  a
    good mother to them.  Although Mr Harrison was at pains  to  point  out
    her appalling history of criminality, deception and  the  circumvention
    of immigration control,  I did not  understand  the  Respondent  to  be
    making a case to the contrary.  The evidence from the wider family, and
    the school, certainly supports that view. Having had an opportunity  to
    hear directly from KH myself I am wholly satisfied that she  loves  her
    children and  that  they  are  her  priority.  I  even  accept  that  -
    perversely and stupidly - she believed she was doing  the  right  thing
    for her son when she started dealing in heroin. That sordid fact  marks
    her out as a criminal, but it does not negate the fact that  she  loves
    her children. There is generally an assumption that it would be in  the
    best interests of young children to remain with their mother,  in  this
    case there are additional reasons why that is  so.  The  children  have
    already suffered the disruption that divorce always  brings.  It  would
    appear that both their parents made a concerted effort to insulate them
    as far as possible from this turmoil, ensuring that they could continue
    to see their father as often as possible. Their close relationship with
    their father meant that his stroke has been particularly difficult  for
    them. I agree with the primary school that now  more  than  ever  these
    children need the stability that being with their mother, in their  own
    home, can give them.


43. Mr Al-Hadi submitted that life in Jamaica would be "alien" and  "harsh"
    for these children. I do not attach  any  significant  weight  to  that
    matter.  It is true that the children have never lived in Jamaica,  but
    I consider it to be unlikely that  they  would  have  no  knowledge  or
    awareness of Jamaican culture given  that  their  mother,  grandmother,
    aunt and uncle are all first generation migrants from that country, and
    their father is of Jamaican origin  himself.   Children  can,  and  do,
    adapt to their environments, particularly where their primary carer  is
    with them.   I accept that life in Jamaica would be different, but I am
    unable to say that simply by virtue of it being Jamaica that life there
    would be contrary to their best interests.  Mr Al-Hadi did not  support
    his submission with, for instance,  any  reference  to  the  health  or
    education systems there, nor to the likely socio-economic circumstances
    that these children would find themselves in.

44. I am nevertheless satisfied that it  would  be  contrary  to  the  best
    interests of S and T if they were to go to Jamaica with  their  mother.
    The principle reason why, and one  that  I  have  attached  significant
    weight to, is the fact  that  their  British  father  remains  in  this
    country. He is entitled to have regular contact with his children,  and
    I am wholly satisfied that it is in their best interests that the close
    bond that they have with him is not  reduced  to  intermittent  contact
    through "modern means of communication" and the occasional holiday.  It
    is clear that the adults in this family have made a concerted effort to
    ensure that the breakdown of their relationship does not interfere with
    the children's relationships with FBC.  They are close to him, and have
    continued to see him on  a  regular  basis  throughout  his  period  of
    illness. It is firmly in the best interests of the children that  their
    relationship with their father continues as it is now.

45. Against these findings,  I  must  weigh  the  public  interest  in  the
    deportation of KH.

46. KH received a sentence of 33 months in a  young  offenders  institution
    for possession of heroin with intent to  supply.  Before  me  she  gave
    candid evidence of how that operation worked. She was by no  means  the
    person who profited the most from it. She was in effect paid a wage  by
    another dealer, to whom the takings were all handed over. She  was  not
    involved in the importation or large scale distribution  of  the  drug.
    She was however a key part of the supply chain.  She  had  day  to  day
    contact with the users who were her customers, and it  must  have  been
    all too evident the  extent  to  which  they  were  affected  by  their
    addiction. By her own admission she did this  "work"  for  4-5  months,
    selling up to fifteen wraps per  day.   She  stopped  because  she  was
    caught.  This is a matter that  weighs  very  heavily  in  the  balance
    against her.

47. Eight months after her deportation in 2002 she re-entered this  country
    using someone else's passport, an identity that she was to  assume  for
    the next 12 years, even using it to obtain discretionary leave  in  the
    UK, and using it when she registered the  births  of  her  two  British
    children. To say that this showed a  flagrant  disregard  for  the  law
    would be an understatement.  KH  behaved  as  if  her  removal  was  an
    irrelevance, and as if the immigration laws  of  this  country  had  no
    application to her.  She  applied  for  a  national  insurance  number,
    worked, and  generally  got  on  with  her  life  as  if  her  criminal
    conviction and deportation had never happened.      These  are  matters
    that weigh very heavily in the balance against her.

48. It does not appear to be disputed by the Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department that the deportation of KH is likely to  have  a  harsh
    impact on her children. I must determine whether it would  be  "unduly"
    so. The more serious the criminality the more serious  the  detrimental
    impact on the children would have to be if the public interest were  to
    be outweighed. "Unduly" has been  held  to  import  a  high  test:  put
    another way I must be satisfied that the effect on the  children  would
    be "inordinately bleak" or "excessively harsh".

49. This was not an easy case to determine. KH has, I have found,  shown  a
    flagrant disregard for the  laws  of  this  country  over  a  prolonged
    period, and this adds to the already  heavy  weight  attracted  by  her
    sentence of 33 months for dealing heroin.   I have  little  doubt  that
    she would have continued to exercise deception by living in her assumed
    identity indefinitely, had she not been caught.  It  would  however  be
    wrong to disregard the context of these events.  The KH who decided  to
    deal in heroin was a  young  woman  who  had  faced  some  considerable
    challenges in the preceding years. Becoming pregnant at the age of  16,
    bereaved and finding herself to be a single mother just weeks after her
    17th birthday,  she  set  about  her  migration  to  the  UK  with  the
    deliberate aim of getting her son out of Jamaica.   I accept that  this
    was her primary motivation. Similarly, I accept that  her  decision  to
    return to this country after her deportation was driven by her wish  to
    be  reunited  with  SJ.   Her  behaviour  since,  in  maintaining   the
    deception, has been fuelled by her  desire  to  remain  here  with  her
    children. None of that provides KH with an excuse, nor  mitigation.  It
    does not lessen the weight to be attached to the public interest in any
    way. What it does do is  serve  to  underline  her  commitment  to  her
    children. The decisions that this relatively uneducated and young woman
    took were stupid, misguided and criminal, but I accept that  they  were
    not driven simply by self-interest.


50. The reality is  that  these  children  have  already  suffered  a  very
    significant detriment by the loss of a healthy  father.  Having  had  a
    parent who was able to take a full and active role in their lives  they
    must now face a period of readjustment, where the father who once cared
    for them will be replaced by a father who will, by necessity,  need  to
    look to them for assistance.  It was clear from the evidence of  KH  as
    well as that of Dr Iveson that S and T will still be  able  to  benefit
    from regular contact with  their  father;  he  continues  to  love  and
    support them, but the relationship will be of a qualitatively different
    nature. The consequences of FBC's stroke for this appeal are  profound.
    I accept that it has made the bond between S, T and their  mother  even
    stronger, if that is possible in the context of such young children.

51. Applying all of this to the two limbs of paragraph  399(a)  I  find  as
    follows.

52. It would be unduly harsh for the children to  travel  to  Jamaica  with
    their mother. I place no weight, or at least very little weight, on  Mr
    Al-Hadi's assertions about how difficult they would  find  life  there.
    That might be true but I was given no evidence at  all  upon  which  to
    base a finding about that.   I  do  accept  that  it  would  be  deeply
    disruptive for them, and that this would be very much contrary  to  the
    best interests of children who  have  already  faced  divorce  and  the
    trauma of their father's sudden illness. More importantly it would make
    their continued relationship with  their  father  extremely  difficult.
    In light of Dr Iveson's evidence I consider it to be very unlikely that
    FBC will be able to travel to Jamaica. I accept that KH  has  no  close
    family members left in Jamaica who would be able to bring the  children
    back here on a regular basis (for obvious reasons KH herself  would  be
    unable to  act  as  a  travel  companion).  That  responsibility  would
    therefore fall on the children's respective grandmothers, the mother of
    FBC whom  they  hardly  know,  and  the  mother  of  KH  who  lives  in
    Nottingham. Whilst it is entirely possible that these  women  would  be
    willing and able to facilitate the children's relationships with  their
    father, I consider it likely that such visits  would  be  few  and  far
    between, given the cost and logistics involved. The  'modern  means  of
    communication' that are a  feature  of  life  for  so  many  dislocated
    families are not available here, given the evidence about how difficult
    it is for FBC to make himself understood, particularly over the  phone.
    I find that the children's relationship with their father would be  all
    but nullified if they were to leave the  UK  for  Jamaica.    I  remind
    myself that it is neither S nor T, nor indeed FBC  who  have  committed
    any criminal offences nor breached immigration control, yet it is  they
    would  bear  the  consequences  in  this  scenario.  In  all   of   the
    circumstances, I consider that this would be excessively harsh for  the
    children.


53. I am satisfied that it would be unduly harsh for the children to remain
    in the United Kingdom without their mother.  Their father is unable  to
    care for them in the short to medium term. It may be that at some point
    in the indeterminate future he would be well enough to  do  so,  albeit
    with significant input from social services, but I reject Mr Harrison's
    suggestion that this might be reasonably foreseeable. He was  right  to
    point out that the  medical  evidence  was  limited  -  Dr  Iveson  was
    apparently unable to offer a long-term prognosis- but I do not  propose
    to fill that lacunae with my own speculation about the extent to  which
    FBC might recover. The evidence before me indicates that he is not well
    enough at present, and nor will he be so after he  is  discharged  from
    hospital in three months' time.   The  alternative  would  be  for  the
    children to live with their maternal grandmother in Nottingham. I  have
    no evidence at all about the suitability of such  an  arrangement,  but
    even assuming that she  at  all  times  behave  as  you  might  expect,
    offering these children a warm and loving home, I have serious concerns
    about how separation from their mother  would  affect  these  children.
    Absent direct abuse or neglect most young children are likely to suffer
    detriment if separated from their mother, but I am satisfied  that  for
    these children such separation would be inordinately bleak. The  secure
    and happy life that they enjoyed in their early years - living with mum
    and dad in Leeds - has slowly but surely crumbled around  them.  It  is
    very difficult to imagine how hard it would be for them if their mother
    were to be removed. Many children whose mothers are facing  deportation
    have already known a prolonged separation from her by the time that the
    matter comes before this Tribunal. Not so these children, whose  mother
    went to prison and served her sentence  long  before  they  were  born.
    They have only ever known life  with  her,  and  I  am  satisfied  that
    separation from her would be excessively, or unduly harsh.  It  follows
    that the appeal of KH must be allowed, and so too the appeal of LG.


54. I might add this. At the outset of these proceedings I  was  very  much
    minded to dismiss this appeal, so substantial the weight to be attached
    to this history of offending behaviour.   In the end  the  balance  was
    however tipped by the requirement that I pay  close  attention  to  the
    best interests of these  children,  to  the  circumstances  surrounding
    them, and that of their mother's criminality.  I had an opportunity  to
    hear directly from KH at the hearing. Although this played a negligible
    role in my decision making, I should record that I was  left  with  the
    impression that she was relieved to have  been  uncovered.  I  have  no
    doubt whatsoever that she experiences profound regret for her actions -
    for all of her actions, and for the impact that they have had on all of
    her children.

      Decisions


55. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error  of  law
    such that must be set aside.


56. The decisions in the appeals are remade as follows:


    "the appeals are allowed on human rights grounds".


57. There is an order for anonymity.
