Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Jafar, Counsel, instructed by Liyon Legal Limited
For the Respondent:    Mr Armstrong, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I do not make an anonymity direction under  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

 2. The appellant is a Sri Lankan national.   The  appellant  entered  this
    country on September 13, 2004 with entry clearance as a  student  until
    January 31, 2009. On January 21, 2009 he applied to extend his stay  as
    a Tier 1 Highly Skilled (Post Study) Migrant but this  application  was
    refused on March 18, 2009. His appeal rights were exhausted on July  6,
    2009 and he left the United Kingdom on July 30, 2009.

 3. He then applied for entry clearance as a Tier 4  (General)  Student  on
    August 17, 2009 and this  was  successful.  He  re-entered  the  United
    Kingdom on October 10, 2009 and  his  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) student was extended on March 7, 2011,  April  16,  2012  and
    finally on November 19, 2013 his leave was  extended  until  March  14,
    2015.

 4. On March 5, 2015 he applied to remain under paragraph 276B  HC  395  on
    the basis  he  had  been  living  here  lawfully  for  ten  years.  The
    respondent refused his application on the basis he had left the country
    on July 30, 2009 and did not apply to return  until  August  17,  2009.
    This broke the continuity of his lawful residence.

 5. The appellant lodged grounds of  appeal  on  September  1,  2015  under
    Section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  His
    appeal  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal   Swinnerton
    (hereinafter called "the Judge") on October 21, 2016 and in a  decision
    promulgated on November 18, 2016 the Judge refused his appeal.

 6. The appellant appealed this decision on December 1, 2016. Permission to
    appeal was initially refused by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Grant-
    Hutchinson on May 19, 2017 but when those grounds were renewed  to  the
    Upper Tribunal permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge
    McWilliams on July 13, 2017.

 7. The respondent lodged a Rule 24 response dated August 1, 2017 in  which
    she opposed all grounds of appeal.

 8. The matter came before me on the above date.  The appellant was present
    and represented as set out above.

    Submissions

 9. Mr Jafar adopted his grounds of appeal and submitted that the Judge had
    erred by failing to give any weight  to  what  happened  in  2009.  The
    appellant had been wrongly  refused  leave  to  remain  as  student  as
    evidenced by the Court in the case of Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department v Pankina [2010]  EWCA  Civ  719.  Like  in  that  case  the
    appellant's application had been refused because the respondent wrongly
    stated he was required to have held his funds (ï¿½700) for three  months.
    The ten-year lawful residence period had only been broken  because  the
    respondent refused his application and the appellant  left  the  United
    Kingdom and applied for entry clearance. This was a historic  injustice
    that should have been corrected. The Judge erred because he attached no
    weight to this issue when considering proportionality.

10. Mr Armstrong relied on the Rule 24  response  and  submitted  the  fact
    remained his continuous lawful residence was broken  and  whichever  Mr
    Jafar argued the case the appellant could not have succeeded under  the
    Immigration Rules.  The  Judge  considered  the  relevant  matters  and
    reached a decision open to him on the facts presented.

    FINDINGS

11. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper  Tribunal  Judge  McWilliams.
    She found it arguable that the circumstances of the events in 2009 were
    a material consideration in the proportionality assessment.

12. Mr Jafar sought to persuade me that the respondent  should  never  have
    refused the appellant's  current  application  because  she  had  acted
    unfairly in 2009 when refusing  his  application  for  Tier  1  status.
    However, I reminded Mr Jafar that the Judge  had  only  been  concerned
    with a human rights appeal and in any event the  circumstances  clearly
    demonstrated there had been a break in his lawful residence and even if
    the  Judge  had  been  empowered  to  consider  an  appeal  under   the
    Immigration Rules the facts remained that there  was  a  break  in  his
    lawful residence and his application under paragraph 276B  HC  395  was
    bound to fail.

13. However, this was a human rights appeal and it was necessary  therefore
    for the Judge to consider all  the  evidence  for  the  purposes  of  a
    proportionality assessment. The Judge's assessment of the evidence  can
    be found between paragraphs [21] and [28] of his decision.

14. During the hearing I raised with Mr Armstrong whether he felt the Judge
    had given any weight to the events  of  2009  in  that  assessment.  He
    agreed with me:

      a) Paragraphs [21] to [23] set out the paperwork and  the  appellant's
         family circumstances.

      b) Paragraph [24] set out that he left  the  United  Kingdom  and  his
         continuous residence had been broken.

      c) Paragraphs [25] to [28] dealt with the current situation.

      d) The Judge did not attach any weight to the events of 2009.

15. Given the above facts I indicated to the  representatives  that  I  was
    satisfied there was a clear error in law for the reason given by  Upper
    Tribunal McWilliams. I asked the representatives if they  were  content
    for me to remake this matter in the Upper Tribunal without the need for
    any further submissions and both representatives agreed that this was a
    matter  that  could  be  concluded  without  any  further  evidence  or
    submissions.

16. The relevant factors I have considered are:

      a) The appellant is now 33 years of age and with the exception of  254
         days  he  had  lived  continuously  in  the  United  Kingdom  since
         September 13, 2004. He spent 21 years living in Sri Lanka prior  to
         coming to the United Kingdom in 2004.

      b) The appellant has lawfully obtained  undergraduate  degrees  and  a
         Master's degree in the United Kingdom.

      c) The appellant and his wife, an Egyptian national,  married  in  Sri
         Lanka and have a daughter. His daughter and wife went  to  live  in
         Egypt in August 2014 and they have lived there since. The appellant
         last saw his wife and child in November 2014 when he visited them.

      d) The appellant's  sister  and  brother-in-law  live  in  the  United
         Kingdom. The appellant is a godfather to their children.

      e) The appellant's application as a Tier 1 (Post study) migrant failed
         because the Judge found he had not held  sufficient  funds  in  his
         account for three months. The basis for this finding, which  upheld
         the respondent's refusal  letter,  was  subsequently  found  to  be
         legally flawed  by  the  Court  in  Pankina.  The  appellant  never
         appealed his decision.

      f) The appellant left the United Kingdom and applied to re-enter as  a
         Tier 4 migrant in August 2009 and was granted permission  to  enter
         in October 2009.

      g) The appellant's parents and three siblings live in Sri  Lanka.  His
         father has a business there.

17. The respondent originally considered this application  under  paragraph
    276ADE(vi) HC 395 because he had spent  less  than  20  years  in  this
    country. In order to have succeeded under that Rule the appellant would
    have had to demonstrate there were very significant  obstacles  to  his
    integration into Sri Lanka. The  appellant's  own  immigration  history
    demonstrates his ties to Sri Lanka. He returned there for  26  days  in
    September 2010, for 24 days in November 2011, for 17  days  in  October
    2012, for 9 days in January 2013 and in 2014. His parents and  siblings
    continue to live there. He has studied here with a view to returning to
    Sri Lanka better qualified for work and I am satisfied  the  respondent
    was entitled to find there were no very significant  obstacles  to  his
    integration into Sri Lanka. There was also no claim under  Appendix  FM
    of the Immigration Rules because the appellant's wife and child  reside
    in Egypt-his wife is Egyptian.

18. I am invited to consider the appeal under article 8 ECHR. Mr  Armstrong
    submitted there had to be exceptional reasons for me  to  consider  the
    appeal under human rights but having considered the background and  all
    the circumstances I accept the length of time he has spent  here  is  a
    reason to consider his claim on human rights grounds.

19. The correct approach to an article 8 claim is set out in Razgar  [2004]
    UKHL 00027. The appellant has studied and worked here for over 12 years
    and I accept he has established a private  law  and  requiring  him  to
    leave would interfere with the life he has created here. Such a refusal
    is in accordance with the law because he failed to meet the Immigration
    Rules and it was for reasons set out in article 8(2) ECHR. The issue is
    one of proportionality.

20. In Strbac v SSHD 2005 EWCA Civ  848  the  Court  of  Appeal  said  that
    discrimination  in  respect  of  accommodation  or  employment   cannot
    normally engage Article 8.  This Article confers no right to a home  or
    a job and Article 14 does  not  confer  a  free-standing  right  to  be
    protected from discrimination.


21. Whilst a long period of employment can give rise  to  a  valid  private
    claim I am satisfied that the appellant  has  not  established  a  work
    record in this country. He would have been allowed part-time work as  a
    student and rightly or wrongly he never worked as a Tier 1 migrant.


22. In MG (2005) UKIAT 00113 the Tribunal suggested that it must  be  asked
    in any  event  whether  that  interference  (removal  from  the  United
    Kingdom) will "have consequences of such gravity" as actually to engage
    Article 8 at all.


23. The appellant came here to study and he studied between 2004 and  2015.
    In that time he passed his  exams  and  obtained  a  degree  at  Brunel
    University in aerospace engineering in 2008 and a Master of Science  at
    the same university in Advanced Mechanical  Engineering  in  2012.  His
    status throughout this period is deemed under section 117B of the  2002
    Act as precarious because his status was never settled.


24. When he came to this country in 2004 it would have been  his  intention
    to return to Sri Lanka after he gained his qualifications and whilst  I
    accept he has always been here lawfully the fact remains he would  have
    been aware that his visa gave him no entitlement to remain here.

25. The fact he speaks English is a neutral factor.  I  was  provided  with
    some evidence of his private life outside of his studies.  The  letters
    of support confirm he  is  well  thought  of  by  extended  family  and
    friends.


26. He is a Sri Lankan national and has lived the majority of his  life  in
    Sri Lanka. His parents and  sisters  continue  to  live  there  and  he
    clearly has close contacts with them and extended family  as  evidenced
    by his regular trips to Sri Lanka. He is  a  33-year-old  male  with  a
    degree and a Masters in engineering.


27. I do not overlook his immigration history and in  particular  the  fact
    that but for what happened  in  2009  he  may  have  been  entitled  to
    indefinite leave to remain  under  paragraph  276B  HC  395.  Mr  Jafar
    invited me to attach significant weight to this immigration history and
    what he describes as a historical injustice. As I indicated  above  the
    respondent was entitled to refuse that application and the main  reason
    I am considering his appeal outside of the Rules is his length of  time
    in this country. It is therefore a factor I have given weight  to  when
    assessing whether it would be proportionate to  require  him  to  leave
    this country.


28. His wife and child have never lived here for any period  of  time.  His
    wife has been refused entry clearance as a family visitor  already  and
    in her statement expresses a view that she would be unable to  live  in
    Sri Lanka. However, when they married she and the appellant would  have
    been fully aware that he had no right to remain here and their  married
    lives, when they married, would ultimately be in either  Sri  Lanka  or
    Egypt.


29. I have balanced all the above factors and having done so I find that it
    would not be disproportionate to refuse the appellant's appeal on human
    rights grounds.

    DECISION

30. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

31. I have re-made the decision and I dismiss  the  appellant's  appeal  on
    human rights grounds.
