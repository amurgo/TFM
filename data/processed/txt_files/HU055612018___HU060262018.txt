Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   On 13 February 2018 a decision was made by the  appellant  (hereinafter
    the Secretary of State or SSHD) to refuse leave to remain to the  first
    respondent (hereafter the first  claimant).   The  first  claimant  had
    applied for ILR on the basis of ten years long  residence  and  on  the
    basis of private life.  He  had  entered  he  UK  as  a  student  on  1
    September 2006 and he received grants of leave including as  a  Tier  1
    (General) Migrant until 30 March  2016.   The  claimant's  appeal  came
    before Judge Spicer  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (FtT)  which  in  a
    decision sent on 19 October 2018 dismissed the appeals of his  and  his
    dependent sponsor the second claimant.  The couple  have  two  children
    aged 5 and 3.

2.   At paragraphs 36 and 37 the judge stated:

         "36. I  make  the  following  findings  of  fact  relating  to  the
             Appellant's tax and immigration history.


               i) I accept  that  the  Appellant  runs  an  off-licence  and
                  convenience store situated in Brighton.


              ii)  I  accept  that  the  First  Appellant  relied   on   his
                  accountants to prepare his accounts and  to  submit  self-
                  assessment tax returns on his behalf.


             iii) I accept that, on 19 October  2015,  the  First  Appellant
                  requested his SA302 Self-Assessment tax  calculations  for
                  the years 2011/2012, 2012/2013 and 2013/2014.  I find that
                  the First Appellant's tax calculation  for  the  tax  year
                  2013/2014 disclosed a profit of �23,570.00.


              iv) I find that the First Appellant notified HMRC that he  had
                  additional tax to pay for the year 2013/2014,  because  he
                  subsequently declared that his profit was  �26,785.00  and
                  this was confirmed by HMRC in a letter dated 6  May  2016.
                  The extra tax was  assessed  as  �932.35.   HMRC  did  not
                  penalise the Appellant for amending his tax return.


               v) The First Appellant's application for indefinite leave  to
                  remain submitted on 30 March 2016, postdates the amendment
                  of his tax return and the payment of the extra tax.


              vi) The First Appellant has submitted his tax return  for  the
                  tax  year  2014/2015  showing  total  income  received  as
                  �26,000.00.


             vii) The First Appellant has submitted his tax return  for  the
                  tax year 2015/2016 showing the total  income  received  as
                  �26,210.00.


         37.  The sole issue between the parties in relation  to  the  First
             Appellant's application for indefinite leave to remain relates
             to paragraph  322(5).   There  is  no  issue  taken  with  the
             Appellant's length of lawful residence."


3.   Having set out paragraph 322(5)  of  the  Rules  at  paragraph  39  and
    summarised the SSHD's, policy guidance  in  relation  to  the  type  of
    conduct likely to meet the threshold set out in the  Rules,  the  judge
    concluded:

         "41. I am satisfied that the First Appellant has not been  involved
             in criminality.  He voluntarily contacted HMRC  to  amend  the
             tax return for  2013/2014,  and  incurred  an  additional  tax
             liability.   The  First  Appellant  adequately  explained  the
             circumstances leading to the  amendment  of  his  tax  return,
             namely that he changed accountants towards the end of 2015 and
             requested his tax calculations for the years 2011 to  2014  so
             that they could be checked by his  new  accountants.   It  was
             following the check by his  new  accountants  that  the  First
             Appellant discovered that his profit for  2013/2014  had  been
             wrongly calculated.  It cannot properly be said that the under-
             declaration by his previous accountants  calls  into  question
             his  character  conduct  and  associations.    There   is   no
             suggestion that he  has  been  or  is  a  threat  to  national
             security or subject to a travel ban or has been involved in  a
             sham marriage.


         42.  No other reason has been relied  upon  by  the  respondent  in
             relation to refusing the First Appellant indefinite  leave  to
             remain on the  basis  of  ten  years'  lawful  and  continuous
             residence."


4.   The judge went on to assess the two claimants' Article 8  circumstances
    outside the Rules.  At paragraphs 51 - 53 the judge concluded:

         "51. The First Appellant has established that he has been in the UK
             for ten years lawfully and continuously.  I  have  found  that
             the  Respondent's  decision  to  invoke  paragraph  322(5)  is
             inconsistent  with  the  Respondent's  own  policy   guidance.
             Taking all of the evidence  into  account,  I  find  that  the
             Respondent's decision is a disproportionate interference  with
             the First Appellant's private life.


         52.  Given that the First Appellant satisfies the  requirements  of
             paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules, and  is  entitled  to
             settled status, I find that it would  be  disproportionate  to
             refuse the Second Appellant indefinite leave to remain in  the
             United Kingdom as the partner of the First Appellant.


         53.  I have also considered the best interests of the  children  of
             the First Appellant and the Second Appellant, and find that it
             is in their best interests to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom
             with both of their parents."


    and accordingly allowed their appeals on human rights grounds.

5.   The SSHD's written grounds  contend  that  the  judge  failed  to  give
    adequate reasons for finding on material matters.  In  particular  they
    maintain that the judge failed to take account of the key issue  raised
    in the Reasons for Refusal Letter, namely that:

         "A tax calculation for 2013/14 shows you initially declared a total
         income received of �23,570 from self-employment.  On this basis for
         the period 01 April 2014 to  28  February  2014  had  you  declared
         profit of �23,570 to UKVI you would have been awarded a total of 70
         points so would have been 5 points short of  the  required  75  and
         your application for Tier 1 (General) on 7 March  2014  would  have
         been refused."


6.   The grounds also submitted  that  the  judge  was  wrong  to  give  any
    consideration to the  [first  claimant's]  efforts  to  blame  previous
    accountants, as responsibility for the contents of the tax returns  lay
    entirely with the first claimant.

7.   Mr Howells' oral submissions amplified the written grounds  emphasising
    that the judge  had  not  addressed  the  connection  between  the  tax
    discrepancy and the  first  claimant's  immigration  history.   He  had
    sought to amend his tax return only shortly before he applied for  ILR.
    The SSHD was entitled to regard the first claimant's delay  in  seeking
    to rectify his tax returns with the HMRC as significant.  In respect of
    the judge's observations about  the  mistake  made  by  the  claimant's
    accountants, Mr Howells sought to  rely  on  the  case  of  R  (on  the
    application of Khan) v SSHD (Dishonesty, tax return, pre 322(5)) [2018]
    UKUT 384 (IAC), especially paragraph (iv) of  (v)  the  headnote  which
    states:

         "(iv)    For an Applicant simply to blame his or her accountant for
             an "error" in relation to the historical tax return  will  not
             be the end of the matter, given that the  accountant  will  or
             should have asked the tax payer to confirm that the return was
             accurate and to have signed the tax  return.  Furthermore  the
             Applicant will have known of his or her earnings and will have
             expected to pay tax thereon.  If the Applicant does  not  take
             steps within a reasonable time to remedy  the  situation,  the
             Secretary of State may  be  entitled  to  conclude  that  this
             failure justifies a conclusion that there has been  deceit  or
             dishonesty.


         (v)   When considering whether or not the Applicant is dishonest or
             merely careless the Secretary of  State  should  consider  the
             following matters, inter alia, as well as the extent to  which
             they are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):


              i.  Whether the explanation for the error by  the  accountant
                  is plausible;


              ii. Whether the documentation which can be assumed  to  exist
                  (for example, correspondence between the Applicant and his
                  accountant at  the  time  of  the  tax  return)  has  been
                  disclosed or there is a plausible explanation for  why  it
                  is missing;


             iii.  Why the Applicant did not realise that an error had been
                  made because his liability to pay tax  was  less  than  he
                  should have expected;


              iv. Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken  steps  to
                  remedy the situation and, if so,  when  those  steps  were
                  taken and the explanation for any significant delay."


8.   Mr Slatter submits that the SSHD's grounds merely seek to re-argue  the
    case based on speculation as to  the  first  claimant's  motives.   The
    judge clearly understood the SSHD's position as set out in the  Reasons
    for Refusal Letter.  The first claimant's case has always been that  he
    made the correct  application  to  the  UKVI  and  that  the  incorrect
    declaration initially made to HMRC regarding his earnings was due to an
    error by his accountants.  The error was not discovered  until  he  had
    switched to a different set of accountants.  The SSHD had  not  alleged
    fake representatives under paragraph 322(2).  The  judge  had  resolved
    the issues of fact in the claimant's  favour.   Unlike  the  discrepant
    amounts at issue in Khan, which were over �30,000, the amount  involved
    in this case was relatively small.  The SSHD was also wrong to  suggest
    that continuous residence of ten years was dependent on  the  perceived
    misconduct of the first claimant relating to 2015.

My Decision

9.   I see no merit in Mr Slatters' contention that  somehow  the  paragraph
    322(5) issue was irrelevant to the first claimant's  ten  years  lawful
    residence.  It is correct that no action was taken to  revoke  it,  but
    clearly, if the SSHD was right to refuse his incorrect tax  return  for
    2013/14 as dishonest, then  that  amounted  to  misconduct  within  the
    meaning of paragraph 322(5).

10.  However, I am not persuaded that the SSHD's grounds are  made  out  for
    three main reasons.  First of all, the contention that the judge failed
    to take account  of  the  SSHD's  view  that  the  first  claimant  had
    deliberately submitted an incorrect tax return to HMRC for the tax year
    2013/14 in order to achieve an immigration advantage is belied  by  the
    judge's clear identification of this issue at paragraph 7:

         "The First Appellant's application was refused on 8  February  2018
         under paragraph 322(5) of the General  Grounds  for  Refusal.   The
         Respondent   was   satisfied   that   the   First   Appellant   had
         misrepresented his earning at various times and had changed what he
         had represented in respect of his earning to HM Revenue  &  Customs
         (HMRC) and/or to UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) for the purpose of
         reducing his tax liability or for the purpose of obtaining leave or
         both.  This was because of an amendment in the Appellant's  claimed
         income for the tax year 2013/2014.


11.  Second, the judge clearly considered the first  claimant's  explanation
    for the delay in spotting the mistake on his tax return and  in  taking
    action to  rectify  it.  In  essence,  the  judge  accepted  the  first
    claimant's explanation that he had  little  understanding  of  the  tax
    system and that  he  had  only  realised  the  error  when  he  changed
    accountants in late 2015: see paragraph 41.  These findings  were  ones
    which the judge was entitled to reach  on  the  evidence  and  did  not
    involve any failure to take account of any relevant matter.

12.  Third, insofar as the SSHD's grounds seek to argue that the  judge  was
    wrong to accept the first claimant's blaming of the tax  error  on  his
    accountants, the case of Khan is not authority for the proposition that
    accountant error is irrelevant in paragraph  322(5)  cases.   Paragraph
    (v) of the headnote clearly contemplates that explanation for the error
    by the account may be considered plausible  in  certain  circumstances,
    especially when there has been adequate explanation for  the  delay  in
    realising the error and acting to rectify it.  On the  judge's  finding
    in this case  the  first  claimant  had  only  realised  the  error  in
    September 2015 and had then moved relatively quickly to rectify it  (in
    January 2016).

13.  In short, I concur with Mr Slatter that the SSHD's grounds amount to  a
    mere disagreement with the  judge's  findings  of  fact  regarding  the
    circumstances surrounding the first claimant's incorrect tax claim  for
    2013/14 tax year.

14.  Mr Howells did  not  dispute  that  if  the  judge's  findings  on  the
    paragraph 322(5) issue were upheld,  she  was  entitled  to  allow  the
    claimant's appeal on Article 8 grounds

15.  For the above reasons, I conclude that the  judge  did  not  materially
    err in law.

No anonymity direction is made.
