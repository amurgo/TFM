                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. For ease of reference purposes the parties are referred to as they were
    in the First-tier Tribunal so that hereafter Mr Patel is referred to as
    the appellant and the Secretary of State for the Home Department as the
    respondent.

 2. The background to this appeal is that on 6 November 2009 the  appellant
    was granted leave to enter the United Kingdom as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student until 31 July 2011.  On 7 March 2012 he was  granted  leave  to
    remain in the same capacity until 24 November  2014.   However,  on  16
    August 2012 his leave was curtailed to expire on 15 October  2012.   On
    12 October 2012 He made a further application for leave to remain as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant. That application  was  refused  on  8
    January 2013 and it is that  decision  that  is  the  subject  of  this
    appeal.

 3. The appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Hunter who  determined
    it on the papers. The determination  was  promulgated  on  14  November
    2013.   The  judge  found  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet   the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules but then went  on  to  allow  the
    appeal on human rights grounds "to the extent of allowing the appellant
    to remain in the United Kingdom until 30 September 2014".

 4. The judge found that the appellant was a student at the  UK  School  of
    Business from March 2012. However, its licence  was  suspended  in  May
    2012 although he continued with his studies for some time  after  that.
    There is a letter dated 28 September 2012 from UK  School  of  Business
    which refers to the appellant enrolling and studying with them, but the
    letter went on to say that unfortunately the  appellant  would  not  be
    able to continue his studies  any  further  as  the  college's  Tier  4
    licence had been revoked.

 5. Following curtailment of the appellant's leave he found another college
    at which to study, namely London State College, and was assigned a  CAS
    on 11 October 2012 to undertake a two year course.   As  found  by  the
    judge the appellant  thought  that  he  came  within  the  "established
    presence studying in the United Kingdom" definition under paragraph  14
    of Appendix C of the Immigration Rules at the time the application  was
    made.  The Secretary of State found that he did not  come  within  that
    definition as did the judge.  If the appellant had come within it,  the
    maintenance requirements would have been at a far lesser  sum.   As  he
    had not proved an established presence he needed to show that he was in
    possession of �7,200 for a consecutive  28  day  period  prior  to  his
    application but the  bank  statements  produced  showed  that  for  the
    relevant period he was in possession of no more than �2,651.69  at  any
    time.

 6. The judge in what is a carefully considered and reasoned  determination
    found that the appellant could  not  benefit  from  any  of  the  cases
    regarding evidential flexibility or common-law fairness etc.   However,
    he decided that in line with the decision  in  CDS  (PBS:  "available":
    Article 8) Brazil [2010] UKUT 0035 (and in particular paragraphs 19 and
    20 which appear at paragraph 29 of the determination)  it  would  be  a
    disproportionate interference in the appellant's private life to return
    him to India before he completed his (current) course. He  went  on  "I
    would propose to  allow  his  appeal  under  Article  8  to  allow  the
    appellant to remain in the UK until 30 September 2014".

 7. The difficulty with the reasoning for coming to the conclusion that  he
    did is revealed by looking at CDS itself.  Paraphrasing paragraph 17 it
    is apparent that Article 8 does not provide a general discretion for  a
    judge to dispense with the requirements of the Immigration Rules merely
    because the way that they impact in an individual case may appear to be
    unduly harsh.  Acknowledging in paragraph 18 that the appellant in that
    case had been admitted to the UK for the purpose  of  higher  education
    and having made progress enabling an extension of stay in that capacity
    since 2007, gave her no right or expectation of an  extension  of  stay
    irrespective of the provisions of the Immigration Rules at the time  of
    the relevant decision on extension.

 8. As set out in the judge's determination, paragraphs 19 and  20  of  CDS
    refer to circumstances in which courses of study may amount to  private
    life that deserves respect and a change in sponsorship rules during the
    course of a period of study had a serious affect on the ability of  the
    appellant to conclude that course.  In that case the appellant was able
    to establish by evidence that she had funds available to support her if
    needed and the strength of the  public  interest  in  refusing  her  an
    extension based on somewhat arbitrary provisions of  guidance  attached
    to an Appendix to the Rules was, in the panel's judgment, somewhat less
    than a failure to meet a central requirement of the Rules.

 9. In the current appeal there was no change in  sponsorship  rules.   The
    appellant was never able to meet the Rules once it was  clear  that  he
    did not have an "established presence" in the United Kingdom.  In  Miah
    [2012] EWCA Civ 261 it was  established  that  there  is  no  near-miss
    principle applicable to the Immigration Rules.  The Secretary of State,
    and on appeal the Tribunal, must assess the strength of  an  Article  8
    claim, but the requirements of immigration control are not weakened  by
    the degree of non-compliance with those Rules.

10. In MM (Tier 1 PSW; Art 8; "private life") Zimbabwe [2009]  UKAIT  00037
    it was established that a student here on  a  temporary  basis  has  no
    expectation of a right to remain in order to  further  these  ties  and
    relationships if the criteria of the points-based system are  not  met.
    Also, the character of an individual's "private life"  relied  upon  is
    ordinarily by its very nature, of a type which can be formed elsewhere,
    albeit through different social ties, after the individual  is  removed
    from the UK.  In that respect, "private life" claims of this  kind  are
    likely to advance  a less  cogent  basis  for  outweighing  the  public
    interest in proper and effective immigration control  than  are  claims
    based upon "family life" where the relationships are more likely to  be
    unique and cannot be replicated once the individual leaves the UK.

11. Having made the findings that he did and  in  light  of  the  case  law
    referred to, had the judge properly directed himself he would not  have
    concluded that the appeal should  be  allowed  under  Article  8  ECHR.
    Alternatively, if the judge was to decide  that  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State  to  return  the  appellant  to  India  would  be  a
    disproportionate interference in  his  private  life,  then  the  judge
    needed to provide far better reasons for  finding such disproportionate
    interference than in the event he did.  The appellant did not meet  the
    PBS requirements as to maintenance.  There was no evidence  before  the
    judge that the appellant had ample funds available  to  him  and  there
    were no exceptional circumstances as to why  the  appellant  could  not
    continue his private life abroad.  His stay in the United  Kingdom  was
    always on a limited basis and upon completion of his studies  he  would
    be required to return to India.  He had resided in the  United  Kingdom
    less than four years and could fully readapt to life in India.

12. Having found that the judge erred  materially  for  the  reasons  given
    above, I set the determination aside. There was no good reason  not  to
    proceed with the rehearing straightaway.

13. I heard brief evidence from the appellant in English as to his life  in
    the United Kingdom.  He continues to study here but "I am not  thinking
    about after September" as to what the future will bring.   He  accepted
    that he could not meet the maintenance requirements of the Rules and as
    to his private life, he said that he spends most of his time studying.

14. I announced at the hearing that although I had some  sympathy  for  the
    appellant, the fact is that for all the reasons set out earlier in this
    determination the respondent has  shown  that  in  furtherance  of  the
    legitimate aim to maintain an effective system of  immigration  control
    the decision to refuse is proportionate. The appellant  came  here  for
    temporary purposes, in the knowledge that  he  would  be  returning  to
    India, he has been unable to meet the requirements of the Rules and  he
    is able to return to India to pursue his private life  there.   Respect
    that his private life in this country deserves does not show  that  the
    respondent's decision is a disproportionate one.

Decision

15. For the reasons above stated, the judge erred materially in law and the
    decision is set aside.  I substitute for that decision that the  appeal
    is dismissed under the Immigration Rules and under Article 8 ECHR.

16. I was not addressed on the matter  of  anonymity.  There  has  been  no
    anonymity direction made previously and the circumstances of  the  case
    do not warrant such a direction being made. Therefore  I  do  not  make
    one.

17. As to the matter of fees, ultimately the appellant has  failed  in  his
    appeal and therefore there is no fee award made.
