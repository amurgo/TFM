                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant: Absent
For the Respondent: Ms S Jones, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

DECISION AND REASONS

1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.




2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  of  First-tier
Tribunal  Judge  Lodge  promulgated  on  10/08/2018,  which  dismissed   the
Appellant's appeal.

Background


3. The Appellant was born on 31/07/1983 and is a national  of  Pakistan.  On
19/04/2018 the Secretary of State refused the  Appellant's  application  for
leave to remain in the UK because the respondent believes the appellant  had
fraudulently obtained an English Language certificate to support an  earlier
application for leave to remain.

The Judge's Decision

4. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Lodge ("the Judge") dismissed  the  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
decision. Grounds of  appeal  were  lodged  and  on  02/11/2018  Judge  Bird
granted permission to appeal stating inter alia

      It is arguable  that  in  relying  on  the  generic  evidence  in  the
      supplementary bundle in the absence of specific evidence  in  relation
      to the appellant (see paragraphs 21 - 24) the Judge made  an  arguable
      error of law in finding that the respondent has established  that  the
      appellant had employed deception. Further the Judge's findings of fact
      are speculative and not supported by adequate reasoning -paragraphs 28
      to 30. An arguable error of law has been made.

The Hearing

5. The appellant is unrepresented. She did not attend the hearing.  Instead,
she sent a letter dated 7 December 2018 explaining that  she  is  unable  to
attend and asking that the appeal be dealt with in her absence. Attached  to
her letter there are written submissions together with  the  documents  upon
which the appellant relies.

6. (a) Ms Jones, for the respondent, told me  that  the  decision  does  not
contain an error, material or otherwise. I drew Ms Jones' attention to  [24]
of the decision. Ms Jones told me that, before the First-tier Tribunal  both
the appellant and the respondent were represented.  Despite  the  fact  that
there was no Home Office bundle  and  transcripts  of  interviews  were  not
produced, neither party asked for an adjournment. She told me that at  first
blush one might think that the initial evidential burden was not  discharged
by the respondent, but urged me to read [25] of  the  decision,  where,  she
told me, there is an admission from the appellant that she did  not  sit  an
English language test at Cauldon College, despite the fact that her  earlier
application relied on a TOIEC certificate issued from Cauldon College.

(b) Ms Jones took me through the rest of the decision and told me  that  the
appellant could not provide reliable  evidence  about  an  English  language
test which she claims that she took. She told me that the  Judge's  findings
were open to the Judge on the evidence presented and  that  the  grounds  of
appeal amount to nothing more than a disagreement  with  the  facts  as  the
Judge found them to be. She urged me to dismiss the  appeal  and  allow  the
decision to stand.

Analysis

7. On 4 April 2017 the appellant submitted  an  application  for  indefinite
leave to remain in the UK. The respondent refused  that  application  on  19
April 2018.  That  is  the  decision  the  appellant  appeals  against.  The
appellant entered the UK on 2 September 2007 as a student. Leave  to  remain
as a student was extended until 27  January  2014.  The  appellant  made  an
unsuccessful application for leave to remain as a  tier  1  entrepreneur  in
2012. After seeking review and permission to appeal, her appeal rights  were
exhausted on 21 March 2017.

8. The respondent refused the appellant's application relying  on  paragraph
322(1A) and (5) of the immigration rules. The respondent  says  that  in  an
application made on 12/12/2012 the appellant relied on an  English  language
test certificate obtained from Cauldon College on 19/9/2012. The  respondent
says that the test certificate was obtained fraudulently.

9. In SM and Qadir (ETS - Evidence - Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 229  (IAC)
it was held that (i) The Secretary of  State's  generic  evidence,  combined
with her evidence particular to these two appellants, sufficed to  discharge
the evidential burden of proving that  their  TOEIC  certificates  had  been
procured by dishonesty; (ii) However,  given  the  multiple  frailties  from
which this generic evidence was considered to suffer and, in  the  light  of
the actual evidence adduced  by  the  appellants,  the  Secretary  of  State
failed (in this case) to discharge the legal burden  of  proving  dishonesty
on their part. During the course of the determination  Tribunal  added  that
"every case belonging to  the  ETS/TOEIC  stable  will  invariably  be  fact
sensitive.  To this we add that every  appeal  will  be  determined  on  the
basis of the evidence adduced by the parties".

10. From the  case  file,  I  can  see  that  the  respondent  relied  on  a
supplementary bundle of generic evidence containing witness statements  from
Rebecca Collings and  Peter  Millington  and  an  expert  report  from  Prof
French. The bundle also contains the Home Office  guidance  note  containing
findings  about  Cauldon   College,   Essex,   drawn   from   the   criminal
investigation known as "Project Faï¿½ade". Crucially, items 2  and  3  of  the
bundle contain test results dated 19 September 2012 in the appellant's  name
from Cauldon College, together with an analysis from  the  ETS  test  centre
look up tool showing that 100%  of  the  English  language  tests  taken  at
Cauldon College on 19 September 2012 are "questionable".

11. At [25] the Judge records the appellant's admission  that  she  did  not
sit the test at Cauldon College. The Judge finds  that  the  statement  from
the appellant combined with the generic bundle of evidence is sufficient  to
discharge the initial burden of proof. In the  first  sentence  of  [26]  he
says that the burden shifts to the appellant.

12. The appellant's admission that she did not sit an English language  test
at Cauldon College together with evidence  that  Cauldon  College  issued  a
test certificate in the  appellant's  name,  dated  19  September  2012,  is
enough to discharge the initial burden of proof. The  Judge  is  correct  to
find that the respondent's  generic  bundle  bolstered  by  the  appellant's
admission is sufficient  to  shift  the  initial  burden  of  proof  to  the
appellant

13. Between [26] and [31] the Judge considers the  appellant's  explanation.
He analyses the appellants evidence and asks himself whether  that  evidence
amounts to an innocent explanation. He gives clear reasons for finding  that
the appellant cannot explain how  she  obtained  an  English  language  test
certificate from a college that she did not go to. He  gives  clear  reasons
for finding that the appellant cannot provide any meaningful details of  the
college that she says she did go to (to sit the English language test  which
she says she sat). Notwithstanding the terms of the grant of  permission  to
appeal, the Judge's findings of fact are  not  tainted  by  speculation  and
assumption. The Judge's findings are evidence-based findings of fact.

14. The Judge finds that the appellant does not meet the immigration  rules.
He then considers article 8. The Judge goes straight to  paragraph  276  ADE
of the Immigration Rules, and is  right  to  do  so  because  the  appellant
cannot meet the terms of  appendix  FM  (because  none  of  her  family  are
British citizens, none of them have  leave  to  remain  as  a  result  of  a
protection claim)

15. The Judge's  findings  in  relation  to  paragraph  276ADE  are  clearly
sustainable on the facts as the Judge found them to be. The Judge  considers
article 8 outside the rules from [33] of the decision. He takes  account  of
the best interests  of  the  appellant's  two  children.  He  considers  the
appellant's  family  as  a  whole  and  takes  account   of   section   117B
considerations. There is nothing  wrong  with  the  Judge's  proportionality
assessment.

16. In Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013] UKUT 85  (IAC)  the
Tribunal held that (i) Although there is  a  legal  duty  to  give  a  brief
explanation of the conclusions on the central issue on which  an  appeal  is
determined, those reasons need not be extensive if the decision as  a  whole
makes sense, having regard to the  material  accepted  by  the  judge;  (ii)
Although a decision may contain an error of law where  the  requirements  to
give adequate reasons are not met, the Upper  Tribunal  would  not  normally
set aside a decision of the First-tier Tribunal  where  there  has  been  no
misdirection of law, the fact-finding process cannot be criticised  and  the
relevant  Country  Guidance  has  been  taken  into  account,   unless   the
conclusions the judge draws from the primary data were not  reasonably  open
to him or her.

17. A fair reading of the decision demonstrates that the Judge  applied  the
correct test in law. The Judge carried out a holistic assessment of  all  of
the  evidence.  There  is  nothing  wrong  with  the  Judge's   fact-finding
exercise. In reality the appellant's appeal amounts to little  more  than  a
disagreement with the way the Judge has applied the facts as he  found  them
to be. The appellant might not like the conclusion that  the  Judge  arrived
at, but that conclusion  is  the  result  of  the  correctly  applied  legal
equation. The correct test in law has been applied. The  decision  does  not
contain a material error of law.

18.   The decision does not contain a material error  of  law.  The  Judge's
decision stands.

DECISION

19.   The appeal is dismissed. The  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
promulgated on 10 August 2018, stands.
