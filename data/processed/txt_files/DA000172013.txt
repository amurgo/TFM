                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent



                  NOTICE OF VACATION OF HEARING AND REASONS

 1. The hearing on 19 July 2016 is vacated as there is  no  appeal  pending
    before the Upper Tribunal. The matter was listed in error.

 2. This case was initially allowed by Lord Bannatyne and UTJ Kopieczek  on
    26 September 2013. The respondent sought leave to appeal to  the  Court
    of Appeal which was granted. The respondent's appeal was allowed  after
    a full hearing, reported as [2014] EWCA Civ 1636.   The  order  of  the
    Court of Appeal sealed on 17/12/2014 allowed  the  respondent's  appeal
    and remitted the case to the  Upper  Tribunal.   It  then  came  before
    Knowles  J  and  UTJ  Smith  on  23  July  2015.   They  dismissed  the
    appellant's  appeal,  and  on  21  October  2015,  UTJ  Smith   refused
    permission  to  appeal  to  the  CoA.   According  to  the  appellant's
    solicitors, that application was not renewed to the Court of Appeal  so
    there is no appeal pending before either  the  Upper  Tribunal  or  the
    Court of Appeal.

 3. While the Court of Appeal issued an order sealed on  13  January  2016,
    this states that it "has been amended pursuant to the  slip  rule,  and
    supersedes the order sent to the parties on 17/12/2014".   The  purpose
    of this was solely to correct an  error  in  the  earlier  order  which
    recorded wrongly that the appellant was legally aided.  It did not have
    the effect of remitting any appeal to the Upper Tribunal as  there  was
    as at 13 January 2016 no appeal in this matter  pending  before  either
    the Upper Tribunal or the Court of Appeal.
