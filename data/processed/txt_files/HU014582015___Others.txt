For the Appellant:     Ms S Iengar, Counsel instructed by Aston Bond,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants are citizens India and their appeal was dismissed by the
    First-tier Tribunal in a  decision  promulgated  on  10th  March  2017.
    Their only right of appeal was on human rights grounds. As the grant of
    permission states the Judge dismissed the appeals under the Immigration
    Rules not on human rights grounds.  That was  a  fundamental  error  of
    law. The Home Office in the Rule 24  notice  conceded  that  there  was
    indeed an error of law and that the matter should be reheard at a fresh
    oral (continuance) hearing.

 2. At the hearing before me Ms Iengar pointed out  that  the  grounds  for
    permission advanced that the judge had  adopted  the  wrong  burden  of
    proof.  That was clear from paragraph [9] of the decision.  The  burden
    in respect of Article 8 and whether the matter  was  proportionate  lay
    with the Secretary of State.  The judge concentrated  on  consideration
    of whether there are significant obstacles to return  and  appeared  to
    conflate any consideration under Article 8 with the Immigration  Rules.
    His findings are similarly conflated.

 3. Mr Duffy conceded that the  matter  should  return  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge for full consideration. I find that there is an error of
    law and the decision shall be set aside with no findings preserved.

 4. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified. I set aside  the
    decision pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007).  Bearing in mind the nature and extent
    of the findings to be made the matter should be remitted to the  First-
    tier Tribunal under section 12(2) (b) (i) of the TCE 2007  and  further
    to 7.2 (b) of the Presidential Practice Statement.
