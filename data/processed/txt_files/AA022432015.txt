Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of  Bangladesh  born  on  8  June  1987.  He
    appealed against a decision of the respondent dated 23 January 2015  to
    refuse to vary leave to remain in the United Kingdom and to remove  him
    by way of directions under Section 47 of the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.   His appeal came before Judge of the  First-tier
    Tribunal A J M Baldwin ("the FTTJ") who in a decision promulgated on 24
    June 2015 dismissed his appeal on asylum and human rights  grounds  and
    under the Immigration Rules.

 2. The appellant sought permission to appeal.  It was granted by Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal R A Cox on 16 July 2015 who considered  it  was
    arguable that the FTTJ had failed to  give  adequate  reasons  for  his
    findings under the Refugee Convention and in respect of Article  8;  he
    also considered it arguable that the FTTJ  had  made  certain  material
    errors of fact.  Thus the appeal came before me.

Submissions

 3. For the appellant, it was submitted that the  FTTJ  had  been  provided
    with a considerable number of documents yet had only taken into account
    information relating to the charges against the appellant. Furthermore,
    the FTTJ had misinterpreted one of the documents such as to  give  rise
    to an error of fact which impacted on the credibility findings. It  was
    submitted  that  there  had  been  insufficient  consideration  of  the
    documentary  evidence  which,  if  considered,  would  have  shown  the
    appellant was still at risk because of his role  in  the  party.   This
    failure, together with the factual error, constituted a material  error
    of law. It was also  submitted  that  the  FTTJ's  adverse  credibility
    findings on risk on return had tainted his assessment of the Article  8
    claim.

 4. It was submitted for the respondent that  the  FTTJ  had  made  a  fair
    reading of the arrest warrants which were fundamental to the assessment
    of risk. She submitted that other documentary evidence was  of  limited
    relevance. She agreed with the appellant's  counsel  that  the  adverse
    credibility findings as regards risk on  return  had  impacted  on  the
    FTTJ's assessment of his private and family life but averred  that  the
    appellant's fiancï¿½e's oral evidence that she would return to Bangladesh
    with the appellant overrode this.

Discussion

 5. In the words of the FTTJ (paragraph 16), the appellant provided "a very
    large number of documents".  These are listed in the decision  but  are
    not all analysed by the FTTJ.

 6. The  FTTJ  accepted  that  the  appellant's  party  was  known  to  the
    authorities and that members had attracted adverse  interest.  He  also
    found (at paragraph 25) that the "Appellant was a key figure"  in  that
    party.  However, he identified a number of concerns about  the  content
    of the official documents produced by the appellant at the hearing  and
    found "it would appear more likely than not that the  persons(s)  [sic]
    who completed these Warrant Forms is not one familiar  with  the  task"
    (my emphasis).  Furthermore, he concluded, having set out his  analysis
    of some of the evidence, including the documentary evidence of  charges
    against the appellant, that the appellant was "unlikely to be  regarded
    as a threat to the Ruling Party". The standard of proof for  an  asylum
    appeal is lower than the balance  of  probabilities  (R  v  SSHD  ex  p
    Sivakumaran [1998] AC 958).  As  was  said  by  Lord  Simon  Browne  in
    Ravichandran [1996] Imm AR 97, "the question whether someone is at risk
    of persecution for a Convention reason should be looked at in the round
    and all the relevant circumstances brought into account".  In  PS  (Sri
    Lanka) v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 1213 the Court of Appeal  said  that  the
    single test of whether a fear of persecution or ill treatment was  well
    founded was whether on the evidence  there  was  a  real  risk  of  its
    occurrence or re-occurrence. In the present case, the wording  employed
    by the FTTJ leads me to conclude that he has applied the wrong standard
    of proof in reaching his conclusion on the evidence, particularly  that
    some of it is "of very doubtful authenticity".

 7. The FTTJ goes on to conclude in paragraph 25 that  the  appellant  "has
    not, I find, proved to the required standard  that  he  faces  a  well-
    founded fear of persecution for the reasons claimed". Given the  FTTJ's
    earlier reference to the wrong standard of proof, his  conclusion  that
    the Refugee Convention is not engaged is not sustainable.

 8. Furthermore, in relation to the Article 8 claim, the FTTJ took note  of
    his earlier adverse credibility findings. He  states  at  paragraph  26
    "Given the doubts I have as to  the  Appellant's  credibility  and  his
    keenness to remain in the UK for reasons not proven to be those he  has
    proffered, I find his intentions are probably not genuine".  Thus I  am
    satisfied that the findings of the FTTJ on the  Article  8  issues  are
    similarly not sustainable, being tainted  by  the  adverse  credibility
    findings made earlier in the decision.

 9. For these reasons, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains  an
    error of law in the assessment of the evidence and the FTTJ's  decision
    must be set aside in its entirety.  All parties were  agreed  that,  in
    such circumstances, it was appropriate for the  appeal  to  be  decided
    afresh in the First-tier Tribunal.

Decision

10. The making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
    making of an error on a point of law.  The decision is set aside.   The
    appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal, to be dealt with afresh,
    pursuant to Section 12(2)(b)(i) of the Tribunal Courts and  Enforcement
    Act 2007 and Practice Statement 7.2(v), before  any  judge  aside  from
    FTTJ A J M Baldwin.

11. The anonymity direction made in the First-tier Tribunal is maintained.
