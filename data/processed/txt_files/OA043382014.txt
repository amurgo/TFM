For the Appellant:     Mr Reid, Counsel, instructed by Lei Dat Baig
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Miss Johnson, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant Mrs Cezi Zhao, date of birth 13th July 1985, is a citizen
    of the People's Republic of China.

 2. I have considered all of the circumstances and I  do  not  consider  it
    necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 3. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Nicol promulgated on 27th April 2015 whereby  the  judge
    dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the   decision   of   the
    Respondent. The decision by the Respondent is dated 14th February 2014.
     The decision was to refuse the Appellant entry clearance to the United
    Kingdom as the spouse of a person present and  settled  in  the  United
    Kingdom under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules and/or under Article
    8 of the ECHR.

 4. In the decision of 14th  February  2014  the  ECO  gave  the  following
    reasons in brief for refusing the application:-

      a) The ECO was not satisfied that this was a  genuine  and  subsisting
         marriage.

      b) The Sponsor and the Appellant had not  proved  that  the  financial
         requirements of the Rules were met.

      c) As judgment was awaited in the case of MM in the Court of Appeal  a
         final decision had not  yet  been  taken  on  whether  or  not  the
         Appellant met the financial requirements of the Rules.

 5. It appears to be  accepted  that  the  remaining  requirements  of  the
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules, E-ECP, were satisfied by the

    evidence submitted in support of the application.

 6.  An appeal was lodged against that decision. Post the decision of

 7.  the ECO the application was reviewed by the Entry Clearance Manager in
    light of the case of MM v SSHD 2014 EWCA Civ 985.  It was noted by  the
    ECM on the review that the  Appellant's  representative  had  indicated
    that:-

         ... They will supply additional documents at  the  hearing.   I  am
         therefore unable to make any further assessment of her appeal.  Her
         representatives should know well that the standard procedure is  to
         provide any and all documentation with the appeal papers  in  order
         that the ECM can fully review the case  with  a  view  to  possibly
         avoiding a costly and timely appeal hearing.   However  no  further
         documentation has been forthcoming.

 8. In the light  of  the  failure  to  submit  further  evidence  the  ECM
    maintained the refusal both on the grounds that he  was  not  satisfied
    that this was a genuine and subsisting marriage but also on  the  basis
    that the Appellant had not proved  that  she  could  be  maintained  in
    accordance with the requirements of the Rules.

 9. The issue with regard to entry clearance is dealt with  under  Appendix
    FM at Section EC-P: Entry Clearance as  a  Partner.   No  grounds  were
    raised under the suitability criteria.  Under E-ECP.1.1  the  Appellant
    had to meet all of the requirements of  paragraphs  E-ECP.2.1  to  4.2.
    The material provisions are under:-

      a) Paragraph E-ECP.2.6 whereby it  was  necessary  to  show  that  the
         relationship between the applicant and the partner was genuine  and
         subsisting:-and

      b)  Paragraph E-ECP.3.1 whereby it was necessary for the Appellant and
         the Sponsor to show either that the  Sponsor  had  a  gross  annual
         income  of  at  least  �18,600   (see   E-ECP.2.10(a))   or   under
         subparagraph 3.1(b) savings  of  �16,000  plus  additional  savings
         amounting to the equivalent of two and  a  half  times  the  amount
         which is the difference between the  gross  annual  income  of  the
         Sponsor as proved by the specified documents and the sum of �18,600
         set out in E-ECP.3.1(a).

10. Further to that in accordance with Appendix  FM-SE  the  applicant  was
    required to satisfy the  evidential  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE.
    Appendix FM-SE provides as follows:-

    A)   This Appendix sets out the specified evidence applicants  need  to
         provide to meet the requirements of the Rules contained in Appendix
         FM. ...

    B)   Where evidence is not specified by Appendix FM, but is of  a  type
         covered by this Appendix the requirements of  this  Appendix  shall
         apply.

    ...

    D)   (a) In deciding an application in relation to which this  Appendix
             states that specified documents must be  provided,  the  Entry
             Clearance Officer or Secretary of State ("the decision-maker")
             will consider documents that  have  been  submitted  with  the
             application, and will only consider documents submitted  after
             the application where subparagraph (b) or (e) applies.

         (b) If the applicant:

             (i)  has submitted:

             (aa) a sequence of documents and some of the documents in  the
                      sequence  have  been  omitted  (e.g.  if   one   bank
                      statement from a series is missing):

             (bb) a document in the wrong format (for example, if a  letter
                      is not on letterheaded paper as specified): or

             (cc) a document that is a copy and not an  original  document:
                      or

             (dd) a document which does not contain all  of  the  specified
                      information: or

             (ii) has not submitted a  specified  document,  the  decision-
                  maker may contact the applicant or his  representative  in
                  writing or otherwise, and  request  the  document  or  the
                  correct version.  The material requested must be  received
                  at  the  address  specified  in  the  request   within   a
                  reasonable timescale specified in the request.

         (c) The decision-maker will not request documents where he or  she
             does not anticipate that  addressing  the  error  or  omission
             referred to in subparagraph (b) will lead to a  grant  because
             the application will be refused for other reasons.

         (d) If the applicant has submitted:

             (i)  a document in the wrong format; or

             (ii) a document that is a copy and not an  original  document;
             or

             (iii)    a document that does not contain  all  the  specified
                  information but the missing information is verifiable from
                  ...

         (e) Where the decision-maker is satisfied that there  is  a  valid
             reason why a specified cannot be supplied ... he  or  she  may
             exercise discretion not  to  apply  the  requirements  or  the
             documents or to request alternative or additional  information
             or documents be submitted by the applicant.

         (f) Before making a decision under Appendix FM  or  this  Appendix
             the  decision-maker  may  contact   the   applicant   or   the
             representative in writing  or  otherwise  to  request  further
             information or documents.   The  material  requested  must  be
             received at the address specified  in  the  request  within  a
             reasonable timescale specified in the request. ...

11. Thus the  ECM  had  specifically  noted  that  the  Appellant  and  her
    representative had chosen not  to  submit  further  documents  but  had
    indicated  that  they  would   be   submitting   such   documents   for
    consideration at the appeal.

12. The appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Nicol on  15th  April
    2015.

13. Further documents were submitted at the hearing and it appears that  no
    objection was taken to the documents being produced including  evidence
    that the sponsor was earning �10,400 per annum at Ju Fu Restaurant  and
    that he had savings of �53,700 in account [             ],  �10,060  in
    account [                 ]  and  �10,061  in  account  [             ]
    [total �73,121].

14. It may be that the approach  of  the  Respondent's  representative  was
    sensible and pragmatic. The decision appealed against was the  decision
    of the ECO and no final assessment  of  the  finances  had  been  made.
    Equally within appendix FM-SE there is under paragraph D (b) and (e)  a
    discretion to be exercised and the ECO has  not  considered  exercising
    the discretion, which may have resulted in the appeal being allowed and
    returned to the ECO as there may have been an  outstanding  application
    which required a  valid  decision.  To  deal  with  the  documents  and
    determine the appeal on the evidence was a sensible way of  seeking  to
    decide the application and appeal. It is to be noted that in  part  the
    reason for not originally accepting the sponsor's bank account  showing
    the required level of savings was that certain required information was
    missing.  The  bank  account  documents  now  submitted   contain   the
    information.   Whatever the reasons the documents were admitted without
    any objection and the documents prove  that  the  Appellant  meets  the
    financial requirements.

15. As stated by decision  promulgated  on  27th  April  2015  Judge  Nicol
    dismissed the appeal.  In dismissing the appeal the  judge  appears  to
    have dealt in the main with the two issues raised  within  the  refusal
    letter.  Having dealt in paragraphs 30 to 36 with the issue of  whether
    this was a genuine and subsisting relationship the judge  in  paragraph
    37 deals with the financial requirements.

16. Paragraph 37 provides as follows:-

         37.  With regard to the  financial  requirements,  I  am  satisfied
             there was sufficient funds in  the  savings  accounts  of  the
             Sponsor for the required length of time to meet the  financial
             requirements.  However given the Sponsor's declared income, it
             is far from clear how the Sponsor managed to achieve the level
             of savings that he has.  He has indicated that they  had  been
             amassed over the period of his working life,  from  gifts  and
             the business that he conducts with his  brother.   Saving  his
             gross pay in total each year, it would take several  years  to
             reach the level  of  savings  shown.   However  the  financial
             requirements of the Regulations appear to have been met at the
             time that the Entry Clearance Officer made  the  decision  and
             there is insufficient evidence to show that the savings  might
             not be available to the Sponsor to maintain  himself  and  the
             Appellant.

17. Accordingly it appears that the  judge  was  making  the  finding  that
    documentation had been submitted to show that the Appellant and Sponsor
    did in point of fact meet the financial requirements of the  Rules.   I
    am fortified in that view for the comments contained within  paragraphs
    38 and 39 of the decision.  Paragraphs 38 and 39 provide:-

         38.  If, which I do not accept, the Appellant and the  Sponsor  are
             in a genuine and subsisting relationship, it would be open  to
             them to make a fresh application  with  additional  supporting
             evidence.

         39.  Having regard to  all  of  the  above  and  in  particular  my
             findings in respect of the relationship, the appeal under  the
             Immigration Rules fails because of the absence  of  a  genuine
             and subsisting relationship.

18. It is clear that it was on the basis that the judge had not found  that
    this is a genuine and subsisting relationship that he has dismissed the
    appeal.  I am satisfied on the basis of paragraph  37  that  the  judge
    found that the Appellant met the financial and evidential  requirements
    of the Rules in  Appendix  FM  and  Appendix  FM-SE.   The  only  issue
    outstanding was the issue with regard to whether  or  not  this  was  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship.

19. The Appellant appealed against the decision.

20. In paragraph 4 of the Grounds of Appeal to the Upper Tribunal the first
    point made is that the judge had accepted  that  the  Sponsor  had  the
    requisite savings to meet the financial requirements of the Rules under
    Appendix FM.  As set out above  I  am  satisfied  that  the  judge  was
    satisfied that the required documentation had been submitted  and  that
    the Appellant and sponsor had met the  requirements  of  the  rules  in
    respect thereof.  The grounds continue by raising the  one  issue  that
    was left that is the genuineness and  subsisting  relationship  of  the
    marriage.

21. There is a response by the Secretary of State:-

      a) ... The Respondent opposes the Appellant's appeal.  In summary  the
         Respondent will submit inter alia that the judge of the  First-tier
         Tribunal directed himself appropriately.  The findings of the judge
         of the First-tier Tribunal at paragraphs 30 to 39 are all  open  to
         the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  make.   The  findings  are,  it   is
         submitted, adequately reasoned, not perverse in the R (Iran)  sense
         and are sustainable.  It is submitted that the grounds are  nothing
         more than a disagreement with the valid and  reasoned  findings  of
         the FTTJ.

      b) The Respondent requests an oral hearing.

 1. It is with that in mind at the commencement of the hearing I asked  the
    two  representatives  to  clarify  what  points  were  in  issue.   The
    representative for the respondent submitted that it had not been proved
    that the Appellant met the  financial  requirements  of  the  Rules  as
    paragraph 37 when read with paragraphs 38 and 39  clearly  showed  that
    the  judge  did  not  find  that  the  Appellant  met   the   financial
    requirements of the Rules.  It was further submitted that the  required
    documentation  had  not  been  submitted   in   accordance   with   the
    requirements of the Rules and even, if  the  documents  were  submitted
    subsequently to the judge that did not meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules in any event.

 2. In respect of the issues no point was raised within the grounds in  the
    Rule 24 response [Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  Rule
    24].  It is clear that by paragraph 4 of the Grounds of Appeal  it  was
    being  submitted  that  the  Appellant  had  met  the   financial   and
    documentary requirements of the Rules. In response it had been accepted
    that the findings of fact made within paragraph 37  were  open  to  the
    judge to  make  on  the  basis  of  the  evidence  presented.   If  the
    Respondent wished to raise an
    issue with regard to a specific requirement of  the  Rules  and  submit
    that the judge had not  in  fact  found  that  the  Appellant  met  the
    financial requirements then the same  should  have  been  made  obvious
    within the Rule 24 response.   Further  if  the  Respondent  wished  to
    challenge the findings made by the judge within the decision then those
    findings should have been  specifically  challenged  in  that  Rule  24
    response.

 3. The material parts of Rule 24 provides as follows:-

         Response to the Notice of Appeal

         24.  ...

             (1)  (a) Subject to any direction given by the Upper Tribunal,
                      a Respondent may provide a response to  a  Notice  of
                      Appeal.

             (2)  Any response provided under paragraph  1(a)  must  be  in
                  writing and  must  be  sent  or  delivered  to  the  Upper
                  Tribunal ......

             (3)  The response must state-

                  ...

                  (e) whether the Respondent opposes the appeal;

                  (f) the grounds on which the Respondent relies, including
                      in the case of an  appeal  against  the  decision  of
                      another Tribunal, any grounds on which the Respondent
                      was unsuccessful in the  proceedings  which  are  the
                      subject of the appeal, but intends  to  rely  in  the
                      appeal; and

                  (g) whether the Respondent wants the  case  to  be  dealt
                      with at a hearing.

                  ...

 4. In accordance with subparagraph 3(f) the  Respondent  was  required  to
    give notice of any grounds on  which  they  were  unsuccessful  in  the
    proceedings.  As indicated in paragraph 37  a  finding  had  been  made
    which would have been a basis for dismissing the appeal but upon  which
    I am satisfied the Respondent was not successful.

 5. As indicated the response by the  Respondent  under  Rule  24  did  not
    indicate that they challenged any of the findings of  fact  or  put  in
    issue any of the findings  of  fact,  they  merely  asserted  that  the
    findings of fact made by the judge with regard to this being a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship could be maintained.

 6. The Appellant's representative submitted at  the  commencement  of  the
    hearing before me  that  Judge  Nicol  had  found  that  the  financial
    requirements and the manner of proving such were met as  determined  in
    paragraph 37 and that therefore the issues were no longer  in  dispute.
    The Respondent's representative argued that the issue of finances  were
    still in dispute and the required evidence had not  been  submitted  to
    the ECO or to the Secretary of State.

 7. I have no doubt that within paragraph 37 the judge has found  that  the
    Appellant and the Sponsor met the financial requirements of  the  Rules
    on the basis of the additional  evidence  submitted.   There  does  not
    appear  to  have  been  any  challenge  to  that  documentation   being
    considered and assessed by the  judge.   The  judge  has  assessed  the
    evidence and has made the findings accordingly.  I find that  the  Rule
    24 notice does not challenge that finding and accordingly I  rule  that
    the Respondent cannot raise in an appeal an issue which was not  raised
    before the First-tier Tribunal and which has not been raised  in  their
    Rule 24 response to the Tribunal.

 8. Accordingly I rule that the judge's finding that on the  basis  of  the
    additional evidence of the finances of the sponsor submitted  that  the
    Appellant met the financial requirements of  the  Rules  in  accordance
    with Appendices FM and FM-SE is to stand and that that was not an issue
    before me in the appeal.

 9. That leaves the issue with regard to the genuineness and subsistence of
    the relationship.  That is dealt with by the judge in paragraphs 30  to
    36.  Besides the evidence that is referred to within those  paragraphs,
    there was other  evidence  submitted  by  the  Appellant  and  sponsor.
    Additional to the evidence referred to by the judge the  Appellant  and
    sponsor have provided money transfer receipts to show that the  Sponsor
    was  sending  money  to  the  Appellant,  correspondence  between   the
    Appellant  and  the  sponsor  via  QQMail,  telephone  records,  travel
    itineraries to confirm the details of the sponsor travelling  to  China
    and photographs of recent trips.

10. In that regard I draw attention to the case of Goudey [Sudan] 2014 UKUT
    00041, which in part deals  with  the  issue  of  telephone  cards  and
    contact by telephone. The case clearly establishes that  such  evidence
    can be corroborative of the relationship of an appellant and a  sponsor
    existing. I draw attention to  paragraphs  7-10  wherein  it  is  clear
    established  that  money  payments   and   telephone   cards   can   be
    corroborative evidence of a subsisting relationship.

11. I note within paragraphs 30 to 36 Judge Nichols considers the facts  of
    the marriage of the parties.  He goes on to consider the  circumstances
    of the Appellant's statement and referred to it as vague and  in  error
    in certain respects.  The sponsor has referred to a visit made to China
    and the parties living together. There is no reference to such  in  the
    Appellant's statement. The judge says that he does not accept  that  an
    Appellant could make a  mistake  over  such  a  matter  in  the  manner
    prescribed.  He then identifies the photographs and makes comments with
    regard to the photographs indicating that whilst they indicate a couple
    throughout a period of time  it  may  not  be  the  same  couple.   The
    photographs do not show a gathering of people that one might expect  at
    a wedding, he suggested the photographs were taken by third parties  on
    the same trip but there is no evidence from those third parties.  There
    is no supporting evidence to show that  the  two  people  are  actually
    together.

12. The judge had accepted that  the  parties  had  gone  through  a  valid
    marriage.  However  besides  the  documents  to  which  the  judge  has
    referred there were additional documents including  telephone  records,
    money transfer orders to the Appellant, telephone records, evidence  of
    contact by QQmail a form of e-mail.  Goudey makes clear  that  evidence
    of telephone cards and telephone calls and other evidence is capable of
    being corroborative evidence to show communication between the  parties
    such as to constitute evidence of the subsistence  and  genuineness  of
    the marriage.

13. The judge in paragraph 36 states "Having regard to all  the  evidence".
    However if the judge  was  rejecting  the  evidence  of  the  telephone
    records, the money transfers and the  QQmail  the  judge  had  to  give
    justifiable reasons for finding that the evidence was not supportive of
    a genuine and subsisting. The judge has  failed  to  give  reasons  and
    failed to explain why that evidence did  not  support  the  Appellant's
    claim that this was a genuine and subsisting relationship.

14. In respect of the evidence submitted the judge has failed to  give  any
    reason for finding that the evidence  submitted  did  not  support  the
    claim that this was a genuine and subsisting marriage.  Such  evidence,
    as was presented, was capable of amounting to corroborative evidence of
    their being a subsisting and genuine  marriage.  The  failure  to  give
    valid reasons for not accepting that evidence  or  for  rejecting  that
    evidence was an error of law.

15. I intimated to the representatives that if that was my  view  how  best
    could the appeal be further determined.   The  representative  for  the
    Respondent requested that the appeal be remitted to  be  heard  afresh.
    The Appellant's representative was content for the matter to  be  dealt
    with on the basis of the existing evidence and for the appeal to be re-
    decided without further evidence being heard.

16. I indicated that it was in my mind to deal with the matter on the basis
    of the evidence presented I could determine the appeal.

17. I take account of the evidence submitted before Judge Nicol.

18. The sponsor had submitted his  travel  itinerary.  That  itinerary  was
    consistent with the sponsor having been to China to see  the  Appellant
    and staying in China for a  period  of  time.  To  that  extent  it  is
    corroborative of the claims that the sponsor had been to China  to  see
    the Appellant.  In the evidence were Chinese travel cards. Again  those
    travel cards supported the claims by the Sponsor as to his having  been
    to China. That of itself may not have been sufficient to establish that
    the sponsor was visiting the Appellant or was in  a  relationship  with
    the Appellant. However it was evidence that the sponsor was in China at
    material times and gave some support to the Appellant's account in  his
    statement as to where he was at material times.

19. There are a series  of  money  transfers  to  the  Appellant  from  the
    sponsor. That certainly shows that the sponsor is sending some money to
    support the Appellant since their marriage. [see Goudey paragraphs 8and
    9].

20. The electronic mail in the Appellant's bundle, run from  pages  35-124.
    The documents commence in September 2013  some  five  months  and  more
    before the decision.  Much of the  detail  on  the  e-mail  appears  in
    Chinese script. However consistent with the guidance in Goudey such  is
    capable of constituting supporting  evidence  to  show  a  relationship
    between the Appellant and the sponsor. There are also telephone records
    that have to be taken into account. Again there are substantial records
    to show that the sponsor has been telephoning and contacting someone in
    China, ostensibly the Appellant and there is no reason to question that
    iti is the Appellant. As set out in the case of Goudey such are capable
    of constituting supportive evidence of a subsisting relationship

21. I find that there is significant supporting evidence to show that there
    is a genuine and subsisting relationship between the Appellant and  the
    sponsor. There is evidence that the sponsor went to  China  by  way  of
    travel documents, itineraries and Chinese travel cards  which  supports
    his claim to have been to China and to have stayed with the  Appellant.
    There is further evidence of money is being sent by the sponsor to  the
    Appellant. There is evidence of  contact  by  electronic  mail  and  by
    telephone, which again  I  am  satisfied  provides  further  supporting
    evidence that there is a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  between
    the Appellant and the sponsor. Taking all that  evidence  into  account
    and the evidence by the sponsor in his statement, I find that there  is
    a genuine and subsisting relationship between  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor.

22. I find therefore that the  appellant  meets  all  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE. I therefore allow the appeal under  the
    Immigration Rules.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD
As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make no  fee  award
as the proceedings were  brought  about  in  part  by  the  failure  of  the
Appellant to lodge the required documents with the Application.

Signed                              Date
