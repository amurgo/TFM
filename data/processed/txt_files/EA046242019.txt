For the Respondent:    Ms Julie Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals, with permission, against  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dated 14th January 2020 dismissing the  appellant's
    appeal against the Secretary  of  State's  decision.   The  appellant's
    application for a residence card as an extended family member based  on
    his EEA rights under Regulation 8 of the Immigration (European Economic
    Area) Regulations 2016 was refused by the Secretary of  State  on  20th
    August 2019.

 2. The appellant appealed on the following grounds:-

    Ground 1

    First-tier Tribunal Judge Clark failed to direct her mind and apply the
    burden and standard of proof relevant to the EEA appeal.

    At paragraph 21 of the decision the judge stated, "I do  not  find  the
    appellant has substantiated his claim on a balance of probabilities and
    I dismiss it."

    It was contended that this paragraph was merely a closing paragraph and
    it is normally expected that the judge should set out at the  beginning
    of the decision that he/she had expressly directed his or her  mind  to
    the burden and standard of proof before going on to consider the  facts
    in conjunction with the applicable  law  and  this  was  a  fundamental
    error.  It was further contended that the judge had materially erred in
    law in failing to set out the legal test in terms of  Regulation  8  of
    the 2016 Regulations and it is unclear  which  parts  of  Regulation  8
    Judge Clarke referred her mind to.

    Ground 2

    Judge Clarke had criticised the fact  that  the  date  of  the  tenancy
    agreement  (15th  November  2015)  had  been  written  on  the  tenancy
    agreement by hand by the signature of the  property  manager.   It  was
    entirely in the hands of the property manager as to what was written on
    the document. It was  contended  that  the  judge's  criticism  of  the
    evidence was unjustified and amounted to a material error of law.

    Ground 3

    At paragraph 8 of the decision the judge stated that  the  evidence  of
    the payment of rent was contradictory in that the  bank  statements  of
    the sponsor, the  appellant's  sister-in-law,  recorded  rent  payments
    whereas the appellant's brother stated in evidence  that  he  paid  the
    rent.   It  was  contended  that  the  judge's  criticism  was  without
    justification and failed  to  understand  the  evidence  given  at  the
    hearing that the payment of the rent was paid by the sponsor and by the
    appellant's brother.  It was contended that the  payment  of  the  rent
    could have been made in cash as per the appellant's brother and also by
    bank transfer as by the sponsor and the judge  was  wrong  to  fail  to
    address that payments for rent in cash could have been and were paid as
    well as by bank transfer.

    Ground 4

    The judge stated at paragraph 11 that what was missing was  documentary
    evidence to place the appellant at the address given the gaps  in  rent
    being paid.

    It was contended, however that the judge failed to address her mind  to
    the fact that the person had no status in the United Kingdom and  would
    have no documentary evidence to show him at that address. For the judge
    to make a finding that there was a requirement of documentary  evidence
    of the  appellant  living  at  the  address  has  placed  too  high  an
    evidential burden on the Appellant and unrealistic burden.

    Ground 5

    The judge stated at paragraph 13,

         "I find it implausible that a landlord would accept  another  adult
         to live in the property and not be named as a tenant and  there  is
         no letter from the landlord to  confirm  such  permission  and  the
         explanation is implausible  because  the  purpose  of  the  tenancy
         agreement amongst other things is  for  the  landlord  to  lawfully
         evict the adults residing in the property."

    However, the judge failed to understand basic immigration law that  the
    appellant had no status in order to hold a tenancy  agreement  and  was
    forbidden in law to do so under Section 21(1) and (2) of the  2014  Act
    from holding any residential tenancy.  Secondly, the  judge  failed  to
    understand the legal consequences of a landlord  giving  a  tenancy  to
    such a person who had no legal  status  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    landlord could be served with a  penalty  notice  of  up  ï¿½3,000  under
    Section 23 of the 2014 Act.  Hence it was an error  for  the  judge  to
    find that the explanation by the appellant was implausible  because  he
    had no documents and because there was no letter from the  landlord  to
    confirm his residence.  Contrary to the views expressed by the judge it
    was contended that the explanation by the appellant  was  entirely  and
    fundamentally sound.

    Ground 6

    The judge found at paragraph 15,

         "I do not find the appellant has shown he has  ever  lived  in  the
         same household as the sponsor.  The godfather has told me  that  he
         has provided money for the appellant and I find he  has  not  shown
         there are not alternatives for him to reside in, either with family
         or friends or alone elsewhere."

    The judge had materially erred in law in finding "I  do  not  find  the
    appellant has shown he has ever lived in  the  same  household  as  the
    sponsor."  Such a finding was contrary to the evidence provided and the
    weight of the evidence provided by the appellant and his witnesses.  It
    was considered it was not for the appellant  to  show  that  there  are
    alternatives for him to reside either with family or friends  or  alone
    elsewhere and such an issue had not been raised by the appellant in his
    evidence.

    Ground 7

    Further or in the alternative at paragraph 19 of the decision the judge
    made the following finding,

         "I find the sponsor has very occasionally  given  a  small  sum  of
         money, and not enough to show that she has  been  maintaining  him.
         The  brother  has  assisted  the  appellant  financially,  and  the
         godfather and uncle may also have assisted but  the  appellant  has
         not shown how else he has been maintaining himself."

    It was contended that the judge had materially erred  in  that  he  had
    failed to show that she had directed herself properly  or  applied  the
    law in respect of the issue of "maintenance"  in  accordance  with  the
    terms of Regulation 8.

Submissions

 3. At the  start  of  the  hearing  Mr  Collins  had  some  difficulty  in
    connecting to the Tribunal but managed to join using  the  Skype  link.
    He relied on his written grounds of appeal and emphasised  in  relation
    to ground 4 that the appellant could not be on  the  tenancy  agreement
    because of the penalties on landlords and the judge had relied  on  the
    points made under that ground.  Grounds 4 and 5 were linked.  Ground  1
    was a minor point but in the overall reading the judge did  not  appear
    to have directed herself to the burden and standard of proof by setting
    out the same at the outset of the decision.  In relation  to  ground  3
    the judge did not consider the evidence given.  At  ground  6  he  said
    that there was evidence that Mr Gjoni was living in  the  household  of
    the brother and sister.  This was not challenged  in  the  reasons  for
    refusal letter.  At ground 7 it is clear that it is a dependency  issue
    not maintenance.  Some money was paid by the sponsor to  the  appellant
    although it was accepted that the sponsor and  brother  did  not  marry
    until 2017 however, there was no definition of what relative was  under
    Regulation 8.

 4. Ms Isherwood maintained there was no error of law.  The  judge  applied
    the correct standard of proof.  There was no legal basis  to  say  that
    the brother of a boyfriend and girlfriend were  family  members.   This
    brother married an EEA national after the appellant came to the UK  and
    there was no evidence of prior dependency and therefore  the  appellant
    could not meet the Regulations.

 5. The judge did not simply rely on  the  tenancy  agreement.   The  judge
    noted the travel history of  the  sponsor,  that  the  appellant  never
    formed part of the household out of the UK and  looking  at  the  dates
    they could not succeed.  At paragraph 8 the judge was  looking  at  the
    bank statements and rejected that the rent was paid for the  appellant.
    There were contradictions in the evidence identified  at  paragraph  8.
    At paragraph 9 the judge looked at the evidence and found  it  did  not
    support the claim that the  appellant  had  met  the  EEA  Regulations;
    simply  the  judge  had  found  that  the  rent  had  not   been   paid
    consistently.  There was missing evidence, gaps in the rent and no name
    on the tenancy agreement.

 6. Mr Collins rejoindered that the relevant  test  was  a  dependency  not
    maintenance and that the EEA national contributed to money sent to  the
    appellant in Albania cited at paragraphs  16  and  17.   There  was  no
    finding under Regulation 8(2)(a) but that was  not  challenged.   There
    was no concern about being a relative of the appellant.







    Analysis

 7. The Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 have now been
    revoked by  The  Immigration  and  Social  Security  Co-ordination  (EU
    Withdrawal) Act 2020  Schedule 1(1) paragraph 2(2) (December 31,  2020.
    Revocation, however, has effect subject to savings  specified  in   The
    Citizens' Rights (Restrictions of Rights of Entry  and  Residence)  (EU
    Exit) Regulations 2020, Regulation 2 and Schedule 1 and The Immigration
    and  Social   Security   Co-ordination   (EU   Withdrawal)   Act   2020
    (Consequential, Saving, Transitional  and  Transitory  Provisions)  (EU
    Exit) Regulations 2020 Regulations ("The Transitional Provisions").

 8. Schedule 3 paragraph  5  of  the  Transitional  Provisions  deals  with
    existing appeal rights and appeals and as this appeal was extant  prior
    to commencement day, I consider that I retain jurisdiction.  Regulation
    8 of the 2016 Regulations is specified in Schedule 3,  paragraph  6  of
    the Transitional Provisions.

    Existing appeal rights and appeals
        5.-(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (4),  the  provisions  of  the  EEA
      Regulations 2016 specified in paragraph 6 continue to apply-

             (a)to any appeal which has been brought under the Immigration
             (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 and has not been
             finally determined before commencement day,

             (b)to any appeal which has been brought under the EEA
             Regulations 2016 and has not been finally determined before
             commencement day,

             (c)in respect of an EEA decision, within the meaning of the
             EEA Regulations 2016, taken before commencement day, or

             (d)in respect of an EEA decision, within the meaning of the
             EEA Regulations 2016 as they continue in effect by virtue of
             these Regulations or the Citizens' Rights (Application
             Deadline and Temporary Protection) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020,
             which is taken on or after commencement day.

           (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)-

             (a)an appeal is not to be treated as finally determined while
             a further appeal may be brought and, if such a further appeal
             is brought, the original appeal is not to be treated as
             finally determined until the further appeal is determined,
             withdrawn or abandoned; and

             (b)an appeal is not to be treated as abandoned solely because
        the appellant leaves the United Kingdom.

           (3) The revocation of the EEA Regulations 2016 does not  affect
           the application of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
           Regulations 2006 to an appeal that falls within  paragraph  3(1)
           of Schedule 4 to the EEA Regulations 2016.


 9. Prior to revocation Regulation 8 of the 2016  Regulations  (so  far  as
    relevant) read as follows:

    "Extended family member"
         8.-(1) In these Regulations  "extended  family  member"  means  a
        person who  is  not  a  family  member  of  an  EEA  national  under
        regulation 7(1)(a), (b) or (c) and  who  satisfies  a  condition  in
        paragraph  (1A),(2), (3), (4) or (5).

            (1A) ...

         (2) The condition in this paragraph is that the person is-

                 (a)a relative of an EEA national; and

                 (b)residing in a country other than the United Kingdom and
                 is dependent upon the EEA national or is a member of the
                 EEA national's household; and either-

                       (i)is accompanying the EEA national to the United
                       Kingdom or wants to join the EEA national in the
                       United Kingdom; or

                       (ii)has joined the EEA national in the United Kingdom
                       and continues to be dependent upon the EEA national,
                       or to be a member of the EEA national's household.

         (3) ...

         (4) ...

         (5)...

         (6) In these  Regulations,  "relevant  EEA  national"  means,  in
        relation to an extended family member-

                 (a)referred to in paragraph (2), (3) or (4), the EEA
                 national to whom the extended family member is related;

                 (b)referred to in paragraph (5), the EEA national who is
                 the durable partner of the extended family member.

         (7) In paragraphs (2), (3) and (4), "relative of an EEA national"
        includes a relative of  the  spouse  or  civil  partner  of  an  EEA
        national....

          (8) Where an extensive examination of the personal circumstances
        of the applicant  is  required  under  these  Regulations,  it  must
        include examination of the following-

                 (a)the best interests of the applicant, particularly where
                 the applicant is a child;

                 (b)the character and conduct of the applicant; and

                 (c)whether an EEA national would be deterred from
                 exercising their free movement rights if the application
                 was refused.


10. In relation to ground 1, it is not arguable that the judge  misdirected
    herself in relation to the burden and standard of proof  evidence.   It
    is noted that at paragraph 21 at the close of the  decision  the  judge
    stated, "I do not find the appellant has substantiated his claim  on  a
    balance of probabilities and I dismiss it" but a careful reading of the
    decision shows that the judge had the relevant standard and  burden  of
    proof which is that it is for the appellant to prove his  case  on  the
    balance of probabilities.

11. As confirmed in Latayan v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
    [2020] EWCA Civ 191 dependency is a question of fact and Latayan  cited
    the relevant case of SM (India)  v  Entry  Clearance  Officer  (Mumbai)
    [2009] EWCA Civ 1426 at paragraph 23 as follows:

         "23.     Dependency entails a situation of real dependence in which
             the family member, having regard to their financial and social
             conditions, is not in a position  to  support  themselves  and
             needs the material support of the Community national or his or
             her spouse or  registered  partner  in  order  to  meet  their
             essential needs: Jia v Migrationsverket Case C-1/05; [2007] QB
             545 at [37 and 42-43] and Reyes  v  Migrationsverket  Case  C-
             423/12; [2014] QB 1140 at  [20-24].   As  the  Upper  Tribunal
             noted in the  unrelated  case  of  Reyes  v  SSHD  (EEA  Regs:
             dependency) [2013] UKUT 00314 (IAC), dependency is a  question
             of fact.  The Tribunal continued (in reliance on  Jia  and  on
             the decision of this court in SM  (India)  v  Entry  Clearance
             Officer (Mumbai) [2009] EWCA (Civ) 1426):

                  "19 ... questions of dependency must not be reduced  to  a
                  bare calculation of financial  dependency  but  should  be
                  construed broadly to involve a holistic examination  of  a
                  number  of  factors,  including  financial,  physical  and
                  social conditions, so as to  establish  whether  there  is
                  dependence that is genuine.  The essential focus has to be
                  on the nature of the relationship concerned and on whether
                  it is one characterised by a situation of dependence based
                  on  an  examination  of  all  the  factual  circumstances,
                  bearing in mind the underlying  objective  of  maintaining
                  the unity of the family."

             Further, at [22]

                  "... Whilst it is for an appellant to discharge the burden
                  of proof resting on him to show dependency, and this  will
                  normally  require  production  of   relevant   documentary
                  evidence, oral evidence can suffice if not found  wanting.
                  ..."

12. Latayan also confirmed the guidance given  by  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    Moneke and Others (EEA - OFM) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 341.

         "24.     As to the approach to evidence, guidance was given by  the
             Upper Tribunal in Moneke  and  others  (EEA  -  OFMs)  Nigeria
             [2011] UKUT 341 (IAC):

                   "41.  Nevertheless dependency is not  the  same  as  mere
                  receipt of some financial assistance from the sponsor.  As
                  the Court of Appeal  made  plain  in  SM  (India)  (above)
                  dependency in the sense used by the Court  of  Justice  in
                  the case of  Lebon  [1987]  ECR  2811.   For  the  present
                  purposes we accept that the definition  of  dependency  is
                  accurately captured by the current UKBA ECIs which read as
                  follows at ch.5.12:

                      "In determining if a family member or extended family
                      member is dependent (i.e. financially  dependent)  on
                      the relevant EEA national for the purposes of the EEA
                      Regulations:

                      Financial dependency should be interpreted as meaning
                      that the person needs financial support from the  EEA
                      national or his/her spouse/civil partner in order  to
                      meet his/her essential needs - not in order to have a
                      certain level of income.

                      Provided a person would not be able to  meet  his/her
                      essential living needs without the financial  support
                      of  the  EEA  national,  s/he  should  be  considered
                      dependent on that national.  In those  circumstances,
                      it does not matter that the applicant may in addition
                      receive financial support/income from other sources.

                      There  is  no  need  to  determine  the  reasons  for
                      recourse to the financial support provided by the EEA
                      national or to consider whether the applicant is able
                      to support him/herself by taking up paid employment.

                      The person does not need to be living or  have  lived
                      in an EEA state which the EEA national  sponsor  also
                      lives or has lived."

                  42.  We of course accept (and as the  ECIs  reflect)  that
                  dependency does not have to be "necessary" in the sense of
                  the Immigration Rules, that  is  to  say  an  able  bodied
                  person who chooses to rely  for  his  essential  needs  on
                  material support of the sponsor may be entitled to  do  so
                  even if he  could   meet  those  needs  from  his  or  her
                  economic activity: see SM (India).  Nevertheless where, as
                  in these cases, able bodied people of mature  years  claim
                  to have always been  dependent  upon  remittances  from  a
                  sponsor, that may invite particular close scrutiny  as  to
                  why this should be the case.  We note further that Article
                  10(2)(e)   of   the   Citizens   Directive    contemplates
                  documentary evidence.   Whether  dependency  can  ever  be
                  proved by oral testimony alone is not  something  that  we
                  have to decide in this case,  but  Article  10(2)(e)  does
                  suggest that the responsibility is  on  the  applicant  to
                  satisfy Secretary of State by cogent evidence that  is  in
                  part documented and can be tested as to whether the  level
                  of material support, its duration and its impact upon  the
                  applicant combined together meet the  material  definition
                  of dependency.

                  43.  Where there is a dispute as to dependency  (as  there
                  was  in  the  present  case)  immigration  judges   should
                  therefore carefully  evaluate  all  the  material  to  see
                  whether  the  applicant  has  satisfied  them   of   these
                  matters."

13. Fatima and Others v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2019]
    EWCA Civ 124 held at paragraph 26 that

           "The dependency has to be on the relevant union  citizen.   That
           is clearly and correctly transposed into  the  domestic  law  by
           Regulation 8(2)(c) of the 2006 Regulations."

14.  Mr  Collins  referred  to  the  reasons  for  refusal  letter  as  not
    challenging aspects of Regulation 8, but the clear reason given for the
    application  being  refused  was  the  reference  to  Regulation  8(2).
    Further within the decision letter from the Secretary of  State,  there
    is a challenge to the "adequate evidence" that was  provided  that  the
    appellant was

           "Dependent upon and/or residing with your EEA or Swiss  national
           sponsor prior to entering the United Kingdom and that since  you
           entered the United Kingdom you have continued  to  be  dependent
           upon and/or residing with your sponsor."

15. That makes the critical question plain.

16. The judge made a clear finding at  paragraph  6  that,  "The  appellant
    never formed a part of the household of the sponsor out of the UK"  and
    further at paragraphs 16 and 17 the judge stated that  she  then  moved
    onto the issue of dependency.  Quite clearly at paragraph 16 the  judge
    rejected the  contention  that  the  brother  had  sent  money  to  the
    appellant in  cash  because  of  the  contradiction  in  the  evidence.
    Crucially the judge rejected, for sound reasoning, that  the  appellant
    had shown that, at that relevant time, the EEA  national  had  provided
    support.

17. At that time and prior to his entry to the UK in  2015,  the  appellant
    was not a relative of the EEA national.

18. In particular, when considering dependency, at paragraph 17  the  judge
    states, that the appellant did not know the  provenance  of  the  funds
    afforded him when abroad (i.e., whether they came from the EEA national
    or not) and this was when the brother and his partner were not married.
     Additionally, the brother stated he gave money but as indicated,  '200
    to 300 Euros and not too often'.  The EEA national  confirmed  that  it
    was the brother who would send the appellant money and  when  asked  if
    she contributed, the judge recorded as  follows  that  she  replied  in
    relation to her contributions that 'it was mostly the brother

           "The total amount she gave was 100 Euros and not in big sums and
           she was unable to answer about the brother giving money  to  the
           uncle if she was not present."

19. At paragraph 18 of the decision the judge recorded,  when  asked  about
    money given here in the UK the EEA national, as the judge found,

           "She was asked if the appellant had asked her for money and  she
           hesitated a long time and said she could not say, and then added
           if it was an emergency and say 3 to 5 times, she has given  some
           money in an emergency and only very small sums"

20. In essence the judge found that the

            'sponsor has very, occasionally given a very small sum of  money
           and not enough to show she has been maintaining him'.

21. The judge pointed out at paragraph 16 that there were contradictions in
    the evidence pertaining  to  funds  given  during  the  time  when  the
    applicant was abroad.   While the brother stated in  relation  to  that
    time that he gave the appellant 200 Euros to  300  Euros  and  not  too
    often when he needed the money,  by  contrast  the  appellant  said  he
    received 100 Euros to 200 month in cash.

22. The judge also clearly looked at the question of the  relationship  and
    stated at [17] that,

           "The sponsor said the brother was her boyfriend then and not her
           husband, and that the brother used to send the appellant money".



    The judge recorded,

           "She was asked if she contributed towards the money and answered
           that she would, but it was mostly the  brother",  "She  said  he
           sent 100 to 200 Albanian lek and  she  gave  the  money  to  the
           brother in Euros.  The total [my underlining]  amount  she  gave
           was 100 Euros, and not in big sums and she was unable to  answer
           about the brother giving money to  the  uncle  if  she  was  not
           present".

23. As the judge stated at paragraph 19,

         "I find the sponsor has very occasionally given a very small sum of
         money and not enough to show she has been maintaining him.  I  find
         the  brother  has  assisted  the  appellant  financially,  and  the
         godfather and uncle may also have assisted, but the  appellant  has
         not shown how else he has been maintaining himself."

    In accordance with the assessment of dependency, the evidence given  by
    the appellant in relation to his existence prior to  entry  to  the  UK
    does not support his  contention  that  he  was  dependent  on  an  EEA
    national for his essential needs prior to  his  advent  to  the  United
    Kingdom or that he was a member of the EEA national's  household  prior
    to the marriage of his brother.  It is clear,  and  the  judge  made  a
    specific finding at paragraph 7, that the brother  did  not  marry  the
    sponsor until 2017 and he had already entered  the  United  Kingdom  in
    2015.

24. As Rule 24 pointed out and for the reasons given above, that was  fatal
    to the  appeal.   The  reasons  for  refusal  letter  were  reliant  on
    Regulation 8 as a whole and I am not  persuaded  that  the  judge  went
    outside the remit particularly  as  this  was  not  challenged  in  the
    grounds of appeal.

25. Grounds 2 to 4 relate to the property let but also to a period of  time
    after the applicant came to the UK (prior to which  appellant  had  not
    shown either he lived in a household of or  was  dependent  on  an  EEA
    national).  Notwithstanding, it was open  to  the  judge  to  make  the
    observations on the letter and tenancy agreement at  paragraph  7.   In
    particular the judge found the rent had not been paid in  a  consistent
    manner from 2015 and it was open to the judge to find that there was an
    inconsistency between the evidence of the EEA national and  appellant's
    brother as to who paid the rent rather than both of them.   It  is  not
    that the judge misunderstood the evidence. It was open to the judge  to
    find that there was  a  lack  of  documentary  evidence  to  place  the
    appellant at the address claimed.  In that context, the judge  did  not
    find  that  the  limited  utility  bills  were  of  assistance.    Mere
    disagreement about the weight to be accorded to the evidence, which  is
    a matter for the judge, should not be characterised as an error of law,
    Herrera v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 412.

26.  Grounds 5 to 6 argue that the judge should  have  taken  into  account
    that the appellant was unable to go on the tenancy document because  he
    was in the UK illegally and the landlord would  suffer  penalties,  but
    the European Economic Area Regulations were said to be declaratory  and
    it is the appellant's contention that he was not in the United  Kingdom
    illegally.  His grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal state that
    he is 'a bona fide family member'.

27. Further it was open to the judge, when the evidence had been  submitted
    that the landlord was aware of the appellant's presence,  to  state  at
    paragraph 13, that it was implausible that the landlord  "Would  accept
    another adult to  live in the property and not be named as a tenant and
    there is no letter from the landlord to confer  such  permission",  and
    further "The explanation is implausible  because  the  purpose  of  the
    tenancy agreement amongst other things is for the landlord to  lawfully
    evict the adults residing in the property".

28. The grounds criticise the judge for failing  to  understand  the  legal
    consequences of giving a tenancy to someone with no status  and  it  is
    argued that the judge did not  understand  the  penalties  afforded  to
    landlords who give a tenancy to someone with no legal status.  It  does
    not, however, appear to be appreciated that the landlord's control of a
    property is a very significant factor and thus  the  judge's  reasoning
    that it was implausible that a  Landlord  would  accept  another  adult
    living in the property and not being named on the tenancy agreement was
    unarguably sound.

29. The Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2016  did  not
    dictate the nature of the evidence to be provided and the weight to  be
    placed on the existence or indeed lack of existence of  evidence  is  a
    matter for the judge.  To suggest as the  grounds  do  that  the  judge
    should be prevented from finding that the requirement  for  documentary
    evidence to show the appellant lived at the address placed too high and
    unrealistic an evidential burden on the Appellant, is not an attractive
    argument nor sustainable. Mere assertion of a fact  will  not  suffice.
    The burden of proof is on the appellant to show that he lived  in  that
    property and on the basis of the inadequate and contradictory  evidence
    of the appellant and his witnesses, it was open to the  judge  to  find
    there was nothing to place  the  appellant  at  that  property  at  the
    relevant time save for some utility bills which do not prove  residence
    in the circumstances.

30. As the judge stated some  of  the  rent  payments  were  made  by  bank
    transfer but at paragraph 20

         "Only ï¿½500 odd ever went out of his  the  brother's  account  which
         suggested the rent of one room only for him  and  the  sponsor.   I
         have  not  been  provided  with  recent  bank  statements  and   in
         particular anything to show the rent being paid on the new property
         and the appellant is not named on the council  tax.   There  is  no
         letter from the landlord either to confirm his residence."

31. It was open to the judge to criticise the lack of documentary evidence.

32. Mr Collins submitted that the judge incorrectly referred to maintenance
    as opposed to dependency  but  having  taken  a  holistic  approach  in
    relation to the consideration of the property, the missing  documentary
    evidence and the gaps in rent being paid, the reference to  maintenance
    does not show the judge has not misdirected  himself/herself.   Indeed,
    in respect of the critical  period  of  time  when  the  appellant  was
    outside the UK the evidence was so limited and contradictory  that  the
    grounds do not begin to undermine the decision.

33. In relation to ground 7,  any  such  the  reference  to  the  appellant
    showing alternative accommodation  is  not  material  to  the  decision
    because the crucial point is that the judge stated that 'I do not  find
    the appellant has shown he has ever lived in the same   same  household
    as the sponsor'.  This includes when the appellant was in Albania.   It
    was never contended that the appellant lived in the  household  of  the
    EEA national prior to his entry to the UK and on  the  facts  as  found
    such a finding in relation to current dependency or  household  is  not
    material.

34. The findings  made  by  the  judge  were  sufficiently  and  adequately
    reasoned and, on the findings, which  remain  unchallenged,  the  judge
    demonstrated that the appellant simply had not fulfilled the conditions
    of Regulation 8 of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations
    2016.

35. There has been  no  material  error  of  law  and  the  appeal  remains
    dismissed.
