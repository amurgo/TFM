For the Appellants:    Ms Patel, instructed by Amjad Malik, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants, Razia Begum [aged 63] and Abdul Majeed  [aged  69]  are
    citizens of Pakistan.  They entered the United Kingdom on 5  June  2014
    on visit visas.  On 22 September 2014, they applied for  further  leave
    to remain on the basis of private and family  life.   The  applications
    were refused by the respondent on 12 December 2014 and  the  appellants
    appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  De  Haney)  which,  in  a
    decision promulgated on 15 April  2015,  dismissed  the  appeals.   The
    appellants now appeal, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellants could not succeed  under  Appendix  FM  of  HC  395  (as
    amended) because they had entered the United Kingdom as visitors.   The
    respondent also found that the  appellants  did  not  fall  within  the
    provisions of paragraph 276ADE  and  that  there  were  no  exceptional
    circumstances although it was  noted  that  the  second  appellant  had
    suffered a stroke in 2012.   He  had  received  treatment  in  Pakistan
    following that stroke and there was no reason to believe he  would  not
    continue to receive treatment in  Pakistan.   Ms  Patel  (who  appeared
    before  both  the  First-tier  Tribunal   and   the   Upper   Tribunal)
    acknowledged (as is recorded by the judge at [12]) that the  appellants
    could not succeed under  the  Immigration  Rules.   Their  appeals  had
    proceeded before the First-tier Tribunal  on  Article  8  ECHR  grounds
    only.

 3. Judge De Haney concluded that the appeals should be dismissed on  human
    rights grounds.  He also noted [15] that, had  the  appellants  applied
    for entry clearance from abroad,  they  would  have  been  unsuccessful
    because the property in which they are currently living in  the  United
    Kingdom (two bedrooms) is  inadequate,  housing  both  the  appellants,
    their son, his wife and four children.  The son is  earning  less  than
    ï¿½10,000 per year in order to maintain these dependants.  The judge also
    found  that  the  witnesses  who  gave  evidence  before  me  had  been
    "equivocal" as to when a decision had been made by the family that  the
    appellants should apply to stay in the United Kingdom and not return to
    Pakistan.  The judge observed [18] that the son and daughter-in-law  of
    the appellants "would go to any lengths possible in order to be able to
    support the appellants [but] the fact remains there [had been] a  clear
    attempt to circumvent the Immigration Rules" by applying  to  enter  as
    visitors and shortly thereafter seeking to remain  permanently  in  the
    country.

 4. The lengthy grounds of appeal generally constitute a disagreement  with
    those findings of the judge which were plainly available to him on  the
    evidence.  The judge had noted [19] that the appellants "are  going  to
    need considerable support and treatment which will be provided  through
    the NHS if they are allowed to remain in the  UK."   The  grounds  [21]
    complain that "as visitors [the appellants] have not been eligible  for
    free treatment and have thus far paid or have been liable  to  pay  for
    any treatment they have received on the NHS and  will  continue  to  be
    liable  to  pay  under  the  current  regime."    That   statement   is
    disingenuous.  If the appellants are granted leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom then it was right for the judge to observe that the cost
    of their treatment will then fall on the public purse  (i.e.  the  NHS)
    even though, as overstaying visitors, they have hitherto been liable to
    make payments to the NHS for their  treatment.   Indeed,  in  the  last
    sentence of his decision, Judge De Haney  has  focused  upon  the  very
    factor in this case which gives such considerable weight to the  public
    interest concerned with the removal of  these  appellants.   The  judge
    found that these appellants  entered  the  United  Kingdom  having,  in
    effect, misled the Entry Clearance Officer who granted them visit visas
    because they entered with the  intention  of  remaining  here  and  not
    returning to Pakistan.  It was not speculation on the judge's part that
    they did so in order to be in the company of their relatives but  also,
    importantly, in order in the longer term to obtain free treatment under
    the NHS.  The public interest concerned with  the  enforcement  of  the
    immigration system so as to prevent such an abuse and drain  on  public
    resources  is  particularly  strong.   The   circumstances   of   these
    appellants, by contrast, are not exceptional in  any  way.   They  have
    some medical conditions characteristic of the stage of life which  they
    have now reached and which will no doubt  become  worse  as  they  grow
    older.  The stroke which the second appellant suffered in Pakistan  was
    treated there and there was no evidence before the Tribunal to indicate
    that the appellants could  not  access  appropriate  treatment  now  in
    Pakistan.

 5. With those observations in mind, the question remains whether the judge
    has erred in law.  I find that he did not do  so.   He  examined  quite
    properly the specific evidence in this case and he reached  a  decision
    which was plainly available to him.  The  Upper  Tribunal  should  only
    interfere with such  decisions  where  they  are  plainly  perverse  or
    otherwise wrong in law or where a decision is not supported by adequate
    reasoning.  That is not the case in this appeal.  The  appeals  to  the
    Upper Tribunal are, therefore, dismissed.
