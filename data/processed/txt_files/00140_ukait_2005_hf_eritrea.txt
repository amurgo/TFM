Expert evidence that married women are exempt from  call-up  for  compulsory
military service in Eritrea




Representation:





For the appellant:           Ms P  Yong  of  counsel,  instructed  by  White
Ryland, solicitors


For the respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The appellant, a citizen of  Eritrea,  has  appealed  with  permission
    against the determination of an adjudicator (now an Immigration Judge),
    Ms T Kamara, sitting at  Taylor  House,  in  which  she  dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal on both asylum and human rights grounds against  the
    respondent's decision to refuse her application for asylum and to  give
    directions for her removal  from  the  United  Kingdom  as  an  illegal
    entrant.  By virtue of article  5(1)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
    (Treatment  of  Claimants,  etc)  Act  2004  (Commencement  No  5   and
    Transitional Provisions) Order 2005, the appeal now takes effect  as  a
    reconsideration pursuant to article 5(2) of that Order.


      Background


2.    The appellant entered the United Kingdom on 28 September 2003 using  a
    passport to which she was not entitled.  She applied for asylum on  the
    following day.  The grounds on which she did so may be stated  shortly.
    Her husband, who was an officer in the Eritrean Army, had been involved
    with the banned opposition party EPLF-DP (Eritrean People's  Liberation
    Front - Democratic Party).  As a consequence, he had been  detained  by
    the Eritrean authorities.  About a month later, the  appellant  herself
    joined the EPLF-DP.  However, she was informed by other members of  the
    party that the Eritrean authorities had discovered her involvement, and
    were looking for her in order to arrest her.  It was at that stage that
    she decided to leave Eritrea.  She claimed asylum on the  grounds  that
    she would be at risk of being detained and ill-treated by the  Eritrean
    authorities on return because of her known involvement  with  a  banned
    opposition party.

3.    The respondent rejected  the  appellant's  asylum  application  on  24
    November 2003, and three days later the appellant was notified  of  the
    respondent's decision to give directions for her  removal  from  United
    Kingdom as an illegal entrant.  The appellant exercised  her  right  to
    appeal to an adjudicator against that decision.   This  is  the  appeal
    which came before Ms T Kamara on 9 February 2004.

4.    In her determination, which was promulgated on 17 February  2004,  the
    adjudicator accepted the appellant's evidence  that  she  was  married.
    However, she rejected the appellant's evidence in  all  other  material
    respects.  In particular, at paragraph 26  of  her  determination,  she
    concluded,  "the  appellant's  entire  claim  is  an  invention."   She
    rejected in terms the appellant's evidence that  her  husband  had  any
    political involvement in Eritrea, that he had been arrested,  and  that
    the appellant had ever been of any adverse  interest  to  the  Eritrean
    authorities.   It  was  on  the  basis  of  those  findings  that   the
    adjudicator dismissed the  appeal  on  both  asylum  and  human  rights
    grounds.

      Permission to appeal

5.    The appellant then sought, and was granted, permission  to  appeal  to
    the  former  Immigration  Appeal  Tribunal.   The  grounds   on   which
    permission was granted read as follows:

         "The failure to adduce material before the adjudicator is  entirely
         the fault of the representatives.  However, there has been a recent
         country guideline case in respect of the material  alluded  to  (MA
         (Female Draft Evader) Eritrea CG [2004] UKIAT  00098)  and  in  the
         premises it is appropriate to grant permission."


      Error of law


6.    The appellant's appeal came before this Tribunal  on  27  April  2005,
    albeit as a reconsideration,  rather  than  an  appeal.   The  Tribunal
    concluded that the adjudicator had made an error of law.   Its  reasons
    for arriving at that conclusion are recorded in the appeal file in  the
    following terms:

         "E and R [2004] EWCA Civ 49 - paras 65 and  66.    Risk  on  return
         generally not considered by adjudicator.
         a)  Draft  evasion  noted  by  Adjudicator  at  paragraph   23   of
         determination.  Not specifically raised  as  an  issue  before  him
         [sic] and decision was before  MA  [2004]  00098.    However  issue
         obvious one to be considered.
         b) UNHCR "Position on Eritrea"  Jan  2004  was  not  placed  before
         Adjudicator raises Malta returns and urged states [to] refrain from
         all forced returns of rejected asylum seekers.  Had Adjudicator had
         that doc (combined with US State Report which he had as evidence by
         para 23) his view on return may well have been different.
         Not easy issue.  SE [2004] 00295, AN [2004] 00300, NM [2005]  00073
         and 1 to come.  Generous view of E and R to ensure that fairness is
         done."


    Appellant 's submissions


7.    We heard submissions first from Ms Yong on behalf  of  the  appellant.
    She confirmed that she was relying principally on the  risk  which  the
    appellant would face on return to Eritrea as a perceived draft  evader.
    She was also relying on the latest CIPU (Country Information and Policy
    Unit) Report relating to Eritrea issued in April 2005  which  gives  no
    indication that married women are exempt from the obligation to perform
    military service in Eritrea.

8.    She acknowledged that the appellant had not sought to  appeal  against
    the adjudicator's findings of fact as set  out  in  her  determination.
    Nevertheless, she submitted that the appellant  would  be  at  risk  on
    return  to  Eritrea  on  the  basis  of  the  facts  as  found  by  the
    adjudicator.

9.    In support of that submission, she referred us to a  letter  dated  10
    March 2005 from the Office of  the  UK  representative  of  the  United
    Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to a member of  her  instructing
    solicitors, White Ryland.  In that letter, the UNHCR representative had
    stated inter alia:

         "Persons being deported to Eritrea have long  been  of  concern  to
         UNHCR.  Our position paper highlights the  situation  of  deportees
         from Malta in particular.  Between 30 September and 3 October 2002,
         233 persons were deported from Malta to Eritrea.  170 of them  were
         reported not to have sought asylum, whereas 53 had been rejected in
         the asylum procedure (which was not known to UNHCR  at  the  time).
         They were reportedly arrested immediately on arrival in Asmara  and
         taken to detention incommunicado.  The Eritrean authorities neither
         acknowledged the detentions nor revealed  the  whereabouts  of  the
         detainees to their families or the public.  Subsequent reports have
         suggested  that  those  with  children  and  those  over  40   (the
         conscription limit) may have soon afterwards been released, but the
         remainder  were  -  and  many  possibly  still  are   -   kept   in
         incommunicado detention in secret places, described as  halls  made
         of iron sheets and underground  bunkers.   According  to  different
         sources, the detainees were deprived of their belongings (including
         shoes  and  clothes  to  change),  subjected  to   forced   labour,
         interrogated and tortured (e.g. by beating, tying up and  prolonged
         exposure to sun at high temperatures).  The dwellings are  said  to
         be congested and lacking the facilities for personal hygiene.  Food
         and water provided for the detainees  is  inadequate  and  unclean.
         Consequently, many of the detainees have  succumbed  to  illnesses,
         notably various skin conditions and diarrhoea.   Medical  treatment
         is said not to be available.  Some detainees are believed  to  have
         died of their diseases and/or injuries.  At least  one  person  was
         allegedly killed by shooting during an escape attempt."

10.   Ms Yong also referred us to the Human Rights Watch World  Report  2005
    Index relating to Eritrea which stated inter alia:

         "The government detains about 350 refugees  who  fled  Eritrea  but
         were involuntarily repatriated in 2002 (from  Malta)  and  in  2004
         (from Libya).  They are held incommunicado in detention centers  on
         the Red Sea coast and in the Dahlak islands.  Faced with  the  grim
         prospect of incommunicado detention and torture, a planeload of  75
         Eritreans  being  forcibly   returned   to   Eritrea   from   Libya
         commandeered their Libyan  transport  and  forced  it  to  land  in
         Sudan."

11.   She drew our attention to the second page of  the  same  report  which
    states, "All Eritreans between the ages of eighteen and forty-five must
    perform two years of compulsory national  service."   She  pointed  out
    that there was nothing in that report to suggest that married women  or
    those who are medically unfit are exempt  from  that  obligation.   She
    acknowledged that Dr David Pool had stated in his report dated 4 August
    2002 (to which we shall refer in further  detail  below)  that  married
    women and the medically  unfit  were  exempt  from  the  obligation  to
    undertake military service.  However, she pointed out that Dr Pool  was
    the only expert who had asserted that married women  were  exempt  from
    that obligation.  In addition, she argued that the  objective  evidence
    showed that married women were amongst those individuals who  had  been
    detained and ill-treated on return  to  Eritrea  from  both  Malta  and
    Libya.

12.   She  referred  to  paragraphs  39  and  40  of  the  country  guidance
    determination of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal in IN (Draft evaders -
    evidence of risk) Eritrea CG [2005] UKIAT 00106 (to which we shall also
    refer in further detail below).  At  paragraph  39,  the  Tribunal  had
    stated in relation to the returnees from Malta,  "Those  released  from
    detention were those not liable for military service,  whether  because
    they are women, children or  over  the  military  service  age."   That
    appeared to indicate that women, or at least some  women,  were  exempt
    from military service. She then suggested that the  hearing  should  be
    adjourned to enable further expert evidence to be obtained in  relation
    to that issue.  Mr Avery, who appeared for the respondent, opposed  the
    application.  He pointed out that the appellant 's own expert evidence,
    in the form of the report dated from Dr  Pool,  stated  in  terms  that
    married women were not liable for military service.

13.   We concluded that it would be  wholly  inappropriate  to  adjourn  the
    hearing  part-way  through  Ms  Yong's  submissions  to  give  her  the
    opportunity to obtain further expert evidence (if indeed such  evidence
    was obtainable at all) to rebut the existing expert evidence adduced by
    the appellant herself, and on which  she  had  relied  at  the  hearing
    before the adjudicator.  We therefore refused the application.

14.    Ms  Yong  resumed  her  submissions.   She   referred   us   to   the
    determination of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal in NM (Draft evaders -
    evidence of risk) Eritrea [2005] UKIAT 00073 at paragraph 15  in  which
    the Tribunal had held inter alia:

         "The evidence of the returns from Malta and Libya indicate that the
         Eritrean  government  is  exceptionally  suspicious  of  those   of
         military age who are returned.  It is not only  the  draft  evaders
         amongst the Maltese returnees who were detained.  Those of military
         service age, even  those  not  identified  as  evaders,  remain  in
         detention.  A similar fate has happened to the Libyan returnees."

15.   She submitted that the situation in Eritrea  was  not  a  normal  one.
    The returnees from both Malta and Libya  had  been  detained  and  ill-
    treated on arrival.  The Eritrean  authorities  had  not  distinguished
    between those who were regarded as draft evaders  and  those  who  were
    not.  She also referred us to two Amnesty International  reports  dated
    28 July 2004 and 9  November  2004  respectively  which  confirmed  the
    report from the UNHCR as to the  detention  and  ill-treatment  of  the
    returnees from both Malta and Libya in 2002 and 2004.  As those reports
    effectively duplicate the report from the UNHCR, we do not consider  it
    necessary to set out the relevant extracts in this determination.

      Respondent's submissions

16.   We then heard submissions from Mr Avery on behalf of  the  respondent.
    He pointed out that the successful appellant in NM had been found to be
    at risk on return, not only because she was a returnee  of  draft  age.
    In  addition,  the  Tribunal  had  recorded  at  paragraph  16  of  its
    determination that "She [the appellant] may be additionally  vulnerable
    because of her  family's  political  history,  the  adjudicator  having
    accepted that her father  had  been  a  member  of  the  ELF  [Eritrean
    Liberation Front]."  He argued that  the  situation  of  the  appellant
    before us was different, as the adjudicator had rejected her claim that
    she and her husband had been involved in any opposition  activities  in
    Eritrea.

17.   He also pointed out that at  the  time  when  she  left  Eritrea,  the
    appellant was about 30 years old.  According to the claim  advanced  on
    her behalf, she had been liable for call-up for military service  since
    she was 18 years old.  However, she did not assert that  she  had  ever
    been required to report for military  service  during  the  intervening
    period of some 12 years.  That was indicative of the fact that she  was
    indeed exempt from military service by reason of her married status.

18.   He also drew our attention to paragraph 44(ii)  of  IN  (to  which  we
    shall refer  in  further  detail  below)  in  which  the  Tribunal  had
    concluded, "If someone falls within an exemption from the  draft  there
    would be no perception of draft evasion."   By  her  own  account,  the
    appellant is a  married  woman.   She  is  therefore  entitled  to  the
    exemption from military service referred to  by  Dr  Pool  in  his  two
    reports.




    Appellant's reply


19.   In reply, Ms Yong drew our attention once again  to  paragraph  15  of
    the determination in NM which discloses that previous  call-up  is  not
    necessary to give rise to a risk on return  to  Eritrea  for  those  of
    draft  age.   In  addition,  she  submitted,   albeit   with   palpable
    hesitation, the adjudicator had not made a clear finding  in  terms  in
    her determination that the appellant was married.


      Conclusions


20.   During the course of her  submissions,  Ms  Yong  confirmed  that  the
    appellant's claim was based on two separate limbs, namely (1) that  she
    would be at risk on return to Eritrea as a failed asylum seeker per se,
    and (2) that she would be at  risk  on  return  as  a  perceived  draft
    evader.  For the sake of completeness, we record that Ms Yong  did  not
    seek to argue that the appellant would be at risk on return  by  reason
    of her claimed involvement in political activities  on  behalf  of  the
    EPLF-DP since her arrival in the United Kingdom in the  terms  recorded
    at paragraph 6 of her supplementary witness statement dated 23 May 2005
    as follows:

          "I have been politically active for the EPLF-DP in  the  UK  since
         around May  2003.   I  participate  in  demonstrations  and  attend
         meetings in London whenever I can afford to."

    As that is not an argument on which the appellant sought to rely before
    us, we do not find it necessary to consider it further.

      General risk as failed asylum seeker

 21.  The first of the limbs on which the  appellant  relied  was  that  she
    would be at risk on return to Eritrea as a failed asylum seeker per se.
     This is an issue  which  was  considered  by  the  Immigration  Appeal
    Tribunal in its  country  guidance  determination  in  IN  notified  as
    recently as 24 May 2005.  The scope of the matters  considered  by  the
    Tribunal in that determination is indicated conveniently at paragraph 2
    of its determination in the following terms:

         "This appeal raises the issue of the nature and extent of the  risk
         of persecution or treatment contrary to Article  3  for  actual  or
         perceived draft evaders being returned to Eritrea and, if there  is
         a risk, whether it extends to all those of  draft  age.  This  case
         will review in the  light  of  the  current  evidence  the  country
         guidance cases MA (female draft evader)  Eritrea  CG  [2004]  UKIAT
         00098, SE (deportation - Malta - 2002 - general  risk)  Eritrea  CG
         [2004] UKIAT 00295 and the  reported  case  GY  (Eritrea  -  failed
         asylum seeker) Eritrea [2004] UKIAT 000327, AT (return to Eritrea -
         article 3) Eritrea [2005] UKIAT  00043  and  NM  (Draft  evaders  -
         evidence of risk) Eritrea  [2005]  UKIAT  00073.   This  appeal  is
         reported as country guidance on these issues."

22.   The Tribunal's conclusions are set out in some detail at paragraph  44
    of its determination as follows:

         "Bringing all  these  factors  together,  and  applying  the  lower
         standard of proof, the Tribunal is satisfied that at present  there
         is a real risk that those who have sought to avoid military service
         or are perceived  to  have  done  so,  are  at  risk  of  treatment
         amounting  to  persecution  and  falling  within  Article  3.    We
         summarise our conclusions as follows:


             (i) On the basis of the evidence presently available, there is
             a real risk of persecution and treatment contrary to Article 3
             for those who have sought or are regarded as having sought  to
             avoid military service in Eritrea.


             (ii)      There is no material distinction to be drawn between
             deserters and draft evaders. The issue is simply  whether  the
             Eritrean authorities will regard a returnee as someone who has
             sought to evade military service or as a deserter.   The  fact
             that a returnee is of draft age  is  not  determinative.   The
             issue is whether on the facts a returnee of draft age would be
             perceived as having sought to evade the draft by  his  or  her
             departure from Eritrea. If someone falls within  an  exemption
             from the draft there would be no perception of draft  evasion.
             If a person has yet to reach the age for military service,  he
             would not be regarded as a draft evader: see paragraph  14  of
             AT.   If  someone  has  been  eligible  for  call-up  over   a
             significant period but has not  been  called  up,  then  again
             there will normally be no basis for a finding that he  or  she
             would be regarded as a draft evader.  Those  at  risk  on  the
             present evidence are those suspected of having left  to  avoid
             the draft.  Those who received call  up  papers  or  who  were
             approaching or had recently passed draft age at the time  they
             left  Eritrea  may,  depending   on   their   own   particular
             circumstances, on the present  evidence  be  regarded  by  the
             authorities as draft evaders.


             (iii)     NM is  not  to  be  treated  as  authority  for  the
             proposition that all returnees of draft age  are  at  risk  on
             return.  In that case the Tribunal found on the facts that the
             appellant would be regarded as a draft evader  and  also  took
             into account the fact that there was an additional element  in
             the appellant's background, the fact that her father had  been
             a member of the ELF, which might put her at risk on return.


             (iv)      There is no justification  on  the  latest  evidence
             before the Tribunal for a distinction between male and  female
             draft evaders or deserters. The risk applies equally to both.


             (v) The issue of military service has become  politicised  and
             actual or perceived evasion of military service is regarded by
             the  Eritrean  authorities  as  an  expression  of   political
             opinion. The evidence also supports the  contention  that  the
             Eritrean government uses  national  service  as  a  repressive
             measure  against  those  perceived   as   opponents   of   the
             government.


             (vi)      The position for  those  who  have  avoided  or  are
             regarded as trying to  avoid  military  service  has  worsened
             since the Tribunal heard MA.


             (vii)     The evidence does not  support  a  proposition  that
             there is a general risk for all returnees.  The determinations
             in SE and GY are confirmed in this respect. In so far as  they
             dealt with  a  risk  arising  from  the  evasion  of  military
             service, they have been superseded by further evidence and  on
             this issue should be read in the light of this determination."


23.   The issue of the general risk to  returnees  was  dealt  with  by  the
    Tribunal at paragraphs 44(iii) and (vii) of its determination.  As will
    be seen from the extract  set  out  above,  at  paragraph  44(iii)  the
    Tribunal  held,  "NM  is  not  to  be  treated  as  authority  for  the
    proposition that all returnees of draft age are at risk on return."  At
    paragraph 44(vii), the  Tribunal  concluded,  "The  evidence  does  not
    support a proposition that there is a general risk for all returnees."

24.   We see nothing in the evidence relied on by  either  party  before  us
    which casts any doubt on the correctness of the Tribunal's  conclusions
    in those  terms.   The  determination  in  IN  is  a  country  guidance
    determination.  It is therefore one which we are  required  to  follow,
    unless we are satisfied that there would be a good reason for not doing
    so.  In the absence of any evidence  to  suggest  that  the  Tribunal's
    conclusions are no longer correct, there is plainly no basis  on  which
    we could arrive at a different conclusion.  We therefore  find  against
    the appellant on this issue.

      Risk as perceived draft evader

25.   We now turn to the second limb on which the appellant  relied,  namely
    that she would be at risk on return to Eritrea  as  a  perceived  draft
    evader.  Whilst the adjudicator rejected the  appellant's  evidence  in
    relation to most aspects of her claim, the one  part  of  her  evidence
    which the adjudicator did accept was the appellant's claim that she was
    married.  The significance of  this  factor  emerged  only  during  the
    course of the hearing before us.

26.    The  documentary  evidence  adduced  by  the  appellant  before   the
    adjudicator included a copy of a report dated 4 April 2004 prepared  by
    Dr David Pool in the capacity of an expert witness.  His qualifications
    to give an expert opinion appear from his CV at the end of that report.
     It discloses inter alia that he studied  Middle  Eastern  and  African
    politics, along with Arabic, for his MA at the School of  Oriental  and
    African Studies, London and for his doctorate at Princeton  University.
    He taught politics at the University of Khartoum, Sudan  from  1972  to
    1976.  Since  1978  he  has  been  a  lecturer  in  Government  at  the
    University of Manchester.

27.   At the end of his report, Dr Pool stated inter alia:

         "With the exception of married women and the medically  unfit,  all
         Eritrean citizens must undertake military service.   Draft  evasion
         is punishable by imprisonment with decisions on detention taken  by
         secret military tribunals.  There is no provision for conscientious
         objection."

28.   That view was expressed by Dr Pool in August 2002.  The fact  that  it
    remains his view is clear from paragraph 24 of the determination in  IN
    where the Tribunal recorded:

         "The appellant relied on an expert report from Dr David Poole [sic]
         dated 15 February 2005.  This confirms that, with the exception  of
         married women  and  the  medically  unfit,  all  Eritrean  citizens
         between the ages of eighteen  and  forty  must  undertake  military
         service and that draft evasion is punishable by  imprisonment  with
         decisions on the length of detention  decided  by  secret  military
         tribunals."

29.   It is unfortunate that Dr Pool has not  disclosed  his  authority  for
    his assertion in both  those  reports.   It  would  clearly  have  been
    preferable if he had identified his source in terms.  Nevertheless,  he
    holds himself out as someone who is qualified to give  expert  evidence
    on the subject.  Furthermore, it is the appellant herself  who  adduced
    his report of 4 August 2002 as part of the expert evidence on which she
    relied.  It is expert evidence which was accepted  by  the  Immigration
    Appeal Tribunal in IN some 2� years later.

30.   It is plainly  not  open  to  the  appellant,  having  adduced  expert
    evidence in support of her appeal, to seek to rely only on those  parts
    of the evidence which assist her claim, and to resile from those  parts
    of it which do not,  at  least  not  without  adducing  further  cogent
    evidence to show why the parts of the earlier report resiled  from  are
    no longer to be regarded as correct.  When this point was raised during
    the course of the hearing before us, Ms Yong was unable to direct us to
    any evidence tending to indicate that Dr Pool's assertion that  married
    women are exempt from military service was not correct.  We have  taken
    due account of her submission that Dr Pool's assertion is not confirmed
    in any of the other objective evidence.  However, the absence  of  such
    confirmation clearly does not in itself constitute a  rebuttal  of  his
    assertion.

31.   Dr Pool's statement that married women  in  Eritrea  are  exempt  from
    military service is one which he made as long ago as August  2002.   It
    is one which he was still making some 2� later in  February  2005.   In
    the absence of any evidence to suggest that it is incorrect, it is  one
    which we accept as an accurate statement  of  the  true  position.   In
    addition, whilst it is not in itself a weighty factor, we  nevertheless
    also take account of the fact that the appellant did not leave  Eritrea
    until she was about 30 years old.  She does not claim that she was ever
    called upon to perform military service prior to her  departure.   That
    in itself is consistent with Dr Pool's evidence that married women  are
    exempt from military service.

32.   As concluded by the Immigration Appeal Tribunal  in  IN  at  paragraph
    44(ii), "If someone falls within an  exemption  from  the  draft  there
    would be no  perception  of  draft  evasion.  ...If  someone  has  been
    eligible for call-up over a significant period but has not been  called
    up, then again there will normally be no basis for a finding that he or
    she would be  regarded  as  a  draft  evader."   That  is  plainly  the
    situation in which the  appellant  would  find  herself  on  return  to
    Eritrea.  In consequence, we are satisfied that she has failed to  show
    that she would be at a real risk of persecution and/or ill-treatment on
    return to Eritrea as a perceived draft evader.

33.   The appellant has failed in relation to both the limbs  on  which  she
    sought to rely before us.  As stated above, Ms Yong  did  not  seek  to
    argue that the appellant would be at risk on return to Eritrea for  any
    other reason.  Accordingly, we are satisfied that the  adjudicator  was
    right to dismiss her appeal on both asylum and  human  rights  grounds.
    Her determination discloses no arguable  error  of  law  on  her  part.
    There is no basis for interfering with it.

      Reporting

34.   It is proposed that this determination should be reported for what  we
    say in relation to the evidence  regarding  the  exemption  of  married
    women from the obligation to perform military service in Eritrea.


    Decision


35.   The Adjudicator did not make a material error of law and the  original
    determination of the appeal shall stand.
