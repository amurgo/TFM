For the Respondent:    Ms A Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of India, born on 25 May 1985.  He  appeals
    with permission against  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Turquet promulgated on 16 April 2015.  She  dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal against the decision of the respondent dated  11  December  2014
    refusing his application made on 12 June  2014  for  further  leave  to
    remain in the UK on the basis of marriage and to remove him by  way  of
    directions under s.47 of the Immigration, Asylum  and  Nationality  Act
    2006.

 2. The appellant indicated before the First-tier Tribunal that  he  wanted
    to have the appeal decided on  the  papers  without  a  hearing.  Judge
    Turquet accordingly proceeded on that basis.

 3. The appellant entered the UK in  October  2009  as  a  Tier  4  General
    Student until 30 January 2011. He was then granted further  periods  of
    leave to remain until 3 April 2014. However, his leave was curtailed so
    as to expire on 12 May 2013. He  was  then  granted  further  leave  to
    remain s a Tier 4 (General) student from 17 June 2013 to 16 June  2014.
    On 12 June 2014 he made an application for leave to remain on the basis
    of his relationship with his partner which was refused on  11  December
    2014.

 4. His case was set out in is application form. As he had a fianc�e and as
    they were engaged, they planned to marry after 13 July 2014. The  Judge
    has recorded that his fianc�e is Bianca Barboza D'Souza Mendes,  is  "a
    Portuguese national" born on 13 July 1966 [7].

 5. In the application form, however, his sponsor's nationality  is  stated
    to be "Brazilian". Accordingly, the Judge wrongly recorded that she was
    Portuguese. The date of her birth, namely 13  July  1996,  is  set  out
    correctly. His spouse would be 18 years old in July 2014 [7].

 6. Their relationship began on  18  June  2013  and  they  started  living
    together in March 2014. It  was  asserted  that  there  was  income  of
    �20,000 from self employment and �4,800 from employment. His sponsor is
    self employed as a cleaner [7].

 7. It was contended in his grounds of appeal that he had  been  a  student
    living in the UK since October 2009 and that he and his sponsor were in
    a genuine relationship and living together. He  intends  to  marry  his
    sponsor.

 8. His grounds of  appeal  contended  that  he  had  submitted  sufficient
    documents to prove his relationship and  to  satisfy  the  grounds  for
    leave to remain. His personal circumstances had not been considered  by
    the respondent. Moreover, his application should have  been  considered
    under "the exceptional  circumstances".  He  also  contended  that  the
    decision was unlawful on Article 8 grounds. The respondent should  have
    exercised her discretion  differently.  The  documents  submitted  were
    photographs, a P60, an HMRC letter, two Santander  bank  statements,  a
    residence permit and a Brazilian passport.

 9. The respondent contended that  he  had  not  provided  any  documentary
    evidence showing that he had been living with his partner. It  was  not
    accepted that the relationship was genuine and subsisting. Nor  did  he
    meet the financial requirements. In particular,  he  had  not  provided
    sufficient documentary evidence showing self employment. Nor  had  they
    provided sufficient documentary evidence to show sufficient savings  to
    meet the income threshold.

10. His private life was considered under paragraph 276ADE of the rules. He
    was 29 years old and had not lived continuously in the UK for at  least
    20 years.  There  would  not  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  his
    integration into India where he had spent 24 years  including  all  his
    formative years. He had not produced any evidence showing  problems  of
    re-integration there.

11. Nor were there any exceptional circumstances  warranting  consideration
    of leave to remain outside of the rules.

12. The appellant provided no further witness  statement  or  documentation
    from either himself or his sponsor at the appeal. Directions were  sent
    to the appellant informing him that  the  Tribunal  may  determine  the
    appeal on the basis of the appeal documents together with  any  further
    written evidence or submissions he may  wish  to  make.  Those  written
    submissions and evidence were to be filed on the Tribunal and served on
    the respondent by 12 March 2015.

13.  Notwithstanding  that  direction,  no  further  written  evidence  was
    produced or submissions made before Judge Turquet.

14. In her findings, Judge Turquet had regard to the  relevant  rules.  She
    found  that  the  appellant  was  unable  to   meet   the   eligibility
    requirements under the partner route. Nor was there any  evidence  from
    the appellant or his sponsor '....to address the  refusal  decision  of
    the respondent. There was little evidence of  their  relationship.  The
    appellant chose not to have an  oral  hearing  and  has  not  submitted
    statements from himself and his partner' [17].

15. She found that  the  appellant  was  unable  to  meet  the  eligibility
    requirements in respect of family life as set out in Appendix FM [18].

16. Nor had the appellant satisfied her that he met the requirements of  E-
    LTRP.3.1. She  was  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  had  provided
    specified evidence showing that he met the financial requirements.  Nor
    had he provided any evidence on appeal to address the issue of finances
    [19].

17. Judge Turquet also noted that the appellant  does  not  have  a  child.
    Accordingly he failed to satisfy the eligibility requirements and  EX.1
    did not apply.

18. Insofar as his private life under paragraph 276(1) ADE  was  concerned,
    she found that the appellant had not shown that he had  or  would  have
    problems re-integrating into life in India. He  had  indicated  in  his
    application that his parents, sister, nephews and nieces live in  India
    and that he speaks the language there [21].

19. Nor did  the  appellant  put  forward  any  compelling  or  exceptional
    circumstances [22]. There was no statement from the  appellant  or  his
    sponsor.  She was thus unable to make any finding that he enjoys family
    life in the UK as he had not submitted  any  evidence  in  the  appeal.
    There was little information about his private life other than that  he
    had studied in the UK. He had not demonstrated that  he  is  unable  to
    enjoy both family and private life in India. She accordingly found that
    there would be no breach of his right to family and private life [22].

20. Moreover, his private life was established whilst in the UK on  limited
    leave in the full knowledge that he may have to return to India [22].

21. She had regard to the public interest considerations  under  s.117B  of
    the 2002 Act. His status  was  precarious  when  he  entered  into  his
    relationship.

22. She stated at [23] that even if she found that Article 8  was  engaged,
    the decision to remove was not disproportionate  in  the  circumstances
    [23].

23. The grounds in the permission application contended that the Judge  had
    referred to the appellant's fianc�e as a  Portuguese  national  whereas
    she is a Brazilian national with indefinite leave to remain.

24. It was noted in paragraph 7 of the grounds that the  Judge  found  that
    the appellant does not have a child. The  grounds  however,  which  are
    drawn by his representatives, state that "..... the appellant  and  his
    fianc�e are expecting a baby together and that  she  is  more  than  12
    weeks pregnant now and also  submitting  documents  from  the  hospital
    confirming  pregnancy along with this permission to appeal application"
    (sic).

25. It was also contended that the finding that his status  was  precarious
    was wrong, as the couple started their relationship when he  had  valid
    leave for more than 15 months. Finally, the Judge  failed  to  consider
    the insurmountable obstacles for the appellant and his fianc�e.

26. In granting permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Frankish stated that it is arguable that the finding  at
    [7] that the Judge was dealing with a Portuguese and  not  a  Brazilian
    sponsor 'amounts to approaching the entire case on a false premise'.

27. Mr Earnest relied on  the  grounds  accompanying  the  application  for
    permission to appeal. That  included  the  fact  that  the  appellant's
    sponsor is pregnant.

28. In a letter dated 7 August 2015, the appellant's  solicitors  requested
    an adjournment of the appeal as the sponsor is 27 weeks'  pregnant  and
    was physically and emotionally unable to attend Court. It is  contended
    that she had been admitted to hospital for three days during July 2015,
    "due to chest pain." In a letter from the hospital dated 22 July  2015,
    it is  recorded  that  she  was  discharged  home  after  she  remained
    clinically stable and her symptoms  improved.  The  principal  resident
    Judge refused that application on the basis that there was  no  medical
    evidence to support the assertion that  the  appellant  was  unable  to
    attend Court. It was also noted that the  discharge  summary  indicated
    the basis upon which the  sponsor  was  discharged  home,  with  future
    management requiring a routine antenatal follow up.

29. On behalf of the respondent, Ms Holmes submitted  that  it  is  evident
    that  the  Judge  made  the  error  as  a  result  of  what  Ms  Holmes
    characterised as "a slip of the pen." She treated the appeal as  though
    the sponsor was Brazilian. In any event however,  the  respondent  made
    her decision on the basis of the sponsor's correct nationality.

30. There was no  evidence  or  submission  placed  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal with regard to the condition of the sponsor or on the issue of
    insurmountable obstacles.

    Assessment

31. The appellant failed to produce  any  written  evidence,  statement  or
    documentation before the First-tier Tribunal, having  elected  to  have
    his appeal considered without an oral hearing.

32. As  already  noted,  he  had  been  directed  to  produce  any  written
    statements and documentation that he sought to rely on at the  hearing.
    However, no such documentation or evidence was produced.

33. There was no evidence before the Judge that the  appellant's  wife  was
    pregnant. That was revealed for the first time when the application for
    permission to appeal was made. The Judge has thus  not  been  shown  to
    have made any error regarding the sponsor's pregnancy, as at  the  date
    of promulgating her decision.

34. As to the Judge's reference to the sponsor as a 'Portuguese'  national,
    I accept that this was an error. However, I am not satisfied that  that
    error was material. Her nationality was not relevant to the  assessment
    as to whether the requirements under the rules had been  met.  Further,
    the respondent had considered the appellant's application as presented,
    which included the assertion that the sponsor was a national of Brazil.



35. There is no contention that the appellant had  produced  the  necessary
    specified documentary evidence so as to satisfy  the  income  threshold
    requirements.  There is no contention that the appellant was  not  able
    to benefit from the criteria set out at EX.1 having failed to meet  the
    eligibility requirements under the ten year route of Appendix FM.

36. Nor was there any evidence produced before  the  Judge  which  properly
    challenged or engaged with the respondent's assertion that there  would
    not be very significant obstacles to  integration  into  India  if  the
    appellant were required to leave the UK, under paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).
    The grounds of appeal did not even engage with that contention. It  was
    simply asserted that the application should have been considered  under
    "the exceptional circumstances" and  that  the  decision  was  unlawful
    under Article 8.

37. In a detailed determination, Judge Turquet has considered and  assessed
    each of the respondent's assertions under the rules. She found that the
    appellant did not have a child. He accordingly failed  to  satisfy  the
    eligibility requirements under EX.1. There is no contention  that  that
    was not a proper finding based on the evidence adduced.  She  also  had
    regard to his  inability  to  meet  the  requirements  under  paragraph
    276(1)ADE. In particular he had failed to satisfy the  requirements  of
    paragraph 276(1)(vi).

38. As noted, there was  no  evidence  put  forward  of  any  very  serious
    problems under paragraph 276. She had regard to the fact  that  he  had
    spent 24 years in India before coming here. He had only been  here  for
    six years. She accordingly found that he had not demonstrated  that  he
    would have problems re-integrating to life in India. She had regard  to
    the fact that he  had  indicated  in  his  application  form  that  his
    parents, sister, nephews and nieces all  live  in  India  and  that  he
    speaks Malayan, the language of Kerala in India [21].

39. The Judge also had regard to the issue  of  compelling  or  exceptional
    circumstances. She found that he had not put forward any compelling  or
    exceptional circumstances. He  did  not  submit  any  evidence  at  the
    appeal. There was no  statement  from  him  or  his  sponsor.   In  the
    circumstances she not even able to find that he enjoyed family life  in
    the UK. In any event, he has immediate family in India. Apart from  the
    fact that he had studied in the UK there was little  information  about
    his private life here.

40. She went on to  consider  and  subsequently  found  that  even  if  the
    proposed removal constituted an interference with his private  life  he
    had established, that had been established in the full  knowledge  that
    he may have to return to India.

41. In the grounds set out in the permission application,  it  is  asserted
    that the finding that his status was precarious when  he  entered  into
    the  relationship  was  incorrect,  as   the   couple   started   their
    relationship when he had valid leave for more than 15 months.

42. In that respect, I have had regard  to  the  decision  in  AM  (s.117B)
    Malawi [2015] UKUT 0160 where the Upper Tribunal stated that Parliament
    has drawn a sharp distinction between any period of time during which a
    person has been in the UK "unlawfully" and any period  of  time  during
    which  that  person's  immigration  status  in  the   UK   was   merely
    "precarious."

43. Those who at any given date held a precarious immigration  status  must
    have held at that date an otherwise lawful grant of leave to  enter  or
    remain. A person's immigration status is "precarious" however if  their
    continued presence in the UK will be dependent upon their  obtaining  a
    further grant of leave.

44. The tribunal also noted that in some circumstances, it may also be that
    even a person with indefinite leave to remain,  or  a  person  who  has
    obtained citizenship, enjoys the status  that  is  "precarious"  either
    because that status is revocable by the secretary of state as a  result
    of their deception, or because  of  their  criminal  conduct.  In  such
    circumstances, the person will be well aware that he has imperilled his
    status and thus it cannot viably be claimed thereafter that his  status
    is other than precarious.

45. I accordingly find that the appellant's ground at paragraph  8  has  no
    merit and is certainly not "irrational" as contended.

46. The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  has  given  a  lengthy  and  detailed
    determination based on the documents and evidence  placed  before  her.
    She has given sustainable reasons  based  on  the  evidence  for  those
    findings.

    Notice of Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    any material error of law and shall stand.

    No anonymity direction is made.
