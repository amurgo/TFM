Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Duffy (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Ms Kabir (Legal Representative)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall, in the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.

 2. The appellants are citizens of Bangladesh.  On  October  28,  2013  the
    first-named applied to remain  as  a  Tier  4  (General)  student.  Her
    husband applied in tandem as her dependant. The respondent refused both
    applications on December 13, 2013 because the first-named appellant had
    already been granted leave to study a course at degree level  or  above
    for 4 years and 1 month and as this proposed course would take her over
    the five year maximum period allowed as  a  Tier  4  (General)  student
    studying a course that consists of degree  level  study  or  above  she
    failed to meet the requirements of paragraph 245ZX(ha) HC 395.

 3. The appellants appealed on December 23, 2013 under section 82(1) of the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 4.  The  matter  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Sweet
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") on October 16, 2014  and  in  a
    decision promulgated on October 27, 2014 he allowed  the  appeal  under
    both the Immigration Rules and article 8 ECHR.

 5. The respondent lodged grounds  of  appeal  on  October  30,  2014.  She
    submitted the FtTJ  erred  by  allowing  the  appeals  by  misdirecting
    himself in law and by failing to apply the approach in R (Nagre) v SSHD
    [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin).

 6. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Lever granted permission to appeal  on
    December 17, 2014 stating there was an arguable errors in law based  on
    the grounds.

 7. The appellants were in attendance in court and were represented as  set
    out above.

    PRELIMINARY ISSUE

 8. Mr Duffy agreed that Paragraph 245ZY HC 395 Note (iii) made clear  that
    the guidance had been incorporated into the Rules and this stated  that
    additional periods leave to remain granted further to the  table  above
    will be disregarded for the purposes of calculating whether  a  migrant
    has exceeded the limits specified at 245ZX(h) to 245ZX(hb).

 9. Mr Duffy indicated his substantive ground of appeal had no merit and as
    the appellants satisfied the Rules it would also be disproportionate to
    remove them under article 8 ECHR.

10. Ms Kabir agreed with his observations and in the circumstances  I  find
    there was no error in law and I dismiss the respondent's appeals.

    DECISION

11. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not disclose  an  error  in
    law. The original decision shall stand in its entirety.

12. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended)  an  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. An
    order was not made in the First-tier and I see no reason to amend  that
    order.
