Representation:
For the Appellant: Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents: Mr H Hersi, Hersi & Co Solicitors



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whilst this is an appeal by the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  (ECO),  for
    convenience I will refer to the parties in the  determination  as  they
    appeared before the First-tier Tribunal

 2. The appellants  are  nationals  of  Somalia.  They  are  siblings,  two
    brothers and three sisters, the youngest two are twins.  They  are  the
    children of Abdulahi Ahmed Hersi (the sponsor) who has indefinite leave
    to remain in the UK. The appellants applied for entry clearance to join
    their father in  the  UK.  The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  refused  the
    applications as he was  not  satisfied  that  the  appellants  met  the
    requirements of paragraph 297 (i), (iii), (iv) and (v) of the Statement
    of Changes in Immigration Rules, HC 395 (the Immigration Rules).  Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal Denson allowed  the  appeals.  The  ECO  now
    appeals with permission to this Tribunal.

 3. For the purposes of these appeals the relevant provisions of  paragraph
    297, as it applied at the date of the applications and refusals, are as
    follows;

"297. The requirements to be met by a person  seeking  indefinite  leave  to
enter the United Kingdom as the child of a parent,  parents  or  a  relative
present and settled or being admitted for settlement in the  United  Kingdom
are that he:
      (i) is seeking leave to enter to accompany or join a  parent,  parents
      or a relative in one of the following circumstances:
           ...
           (d) one parent is present and settled in the United  Kingdom  or
           being admitted on the same occasion for settlement and the other
           parent is dead; or
           (e) one parent is present and settled in the United  Kingdom  or
           being admitted on the same occasion for settlement and  has  had
           sole responsibility for the child's upbringing; or
           ...
       (iii) is not leading an independent life, is unmarried and is  not  a
      civil partner, and has not formed an independent family unit; and
      (iv) can, and will, be accommodated adequately by the parent,  parents
      or relative the child is seeking to join without  recourse  to  public
      funds in accommodation which the parent, parents or relative the child
      is seeking to join, own or occupy exclusively; and
      (v) can, and will, be maintained adequately by the parent, parents, or
      relative the child is seeking to  join,  without  recourse  to  public
      funds; and
      ..."

 4. The background to these appeals as put forward  by  the  appellants  is
    that the appellants' elder sister  travelled  to  the  UK  and  claimed
    asylum in 2002. She was granted asylum. The  appellants'  parents  lost
    contact with them in 2009 when Al Shabab attacked their school and  the
    children went missing and were presumed kidnapped. In fact they escaped
    to Ethiopia with a family friend and are still there.  The  appellants'
    parents were unable to trace the children. As  a  result  of  inquiries
    within the Somali community the sponsor traced his elder  daughter  and
    travelled to Ethiopia to make  arrangements  to  meet  her  there.  The
    appellants' mother died in January 2010 on the way to Ethiopia and  the
    sponsor met his elder  daughter  in  Ethiopia  and  applied  for  entry
    clearance to join her in the UK. His application was  refused  but  the
    appeal against that  refusal  was  allowed  in  May  2011  and  he  was
    subsequently issued with entry clearance and travelled to the UK. As  a
    result of his ongoing inquiries the sponsor located the appellants  and
    made arrangements for them to stay in Ethiopia with a friend in October
    2011. He travelled there to be reunited with them  in  April  2012  and
    stayed for 3 months. The appellants, who were all under 18 at the  time
    of the applications, applied on 4 April 2012  for  entry  clearance  to
    join their father. The sponsor  and  his  daughter  moved  into  larger
    accommodation to accommodate the appellants. The sponsor was in receipt
    of benefits and  the  application  was  made  on  the  basis  that  the
    appellants would be supported by the sponsor, their  sister  and  their
    father's brother-in-law.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge accepted that  the  appellants  were  the
    sponsor's children. He accepted that the appellants' mother had died as
    claimed and that the sponsor has financially supported  the  appellants
    since they were reunited. He was therefore satisfied that  the  sponsor
    had sole responsibility for the children The Judge found that there was
    no evidence that the children were  living  an  independent  life.  The
    Judge accepted that the landlord was  aware  that  the  sponsor's  five
    children  were  being  sponsored  to  come  to  the  UK  and  that  the
    accommodation was adequate.  The  Judge  calculated  the  total  income
    available from the sponsor, his daughter  and  his  brother-in-law  was
    ï¿½1355.18 per month. The Judge calculated that, using the comparator  of
    the relevant income support rates, there is sufficient funds  for  four
    out of the five appellants to be maintained without recourse to  public
    funds. The Judge went on to consider the appeal of the fifth appellant,
    one of the twins, under Article 8 of the European Convention  on  Human
    Rights and decided that the interference to her family life and that of
    the other appellants is not proportionate to the legitimate aim of  the
    enforcement of immigration control.

 6. At the hearing before me Mr Hersi raised a preliminary issue as to  the
    timeliness of the ECO's application for Permission  to  Appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal. He submitted that the ECO served  the  application  for
    Permission to Appeal on the Upper Tribunal ten months late. However the
    grant of permission by Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Eshun  states  that  the
    application was made on 21 November  2013  and,  although  a  hole  was
    punched on the date of the faxed application, it appears  to  state  21
    November 2013. On the basis of this evidence I was satisfied  that  the
    renewed application for Permission to Appeal to the Upper Tribunal  was
    lodged on 21 November 2013 which was in time as the First-tier Tribunal
    refused Permission to Appeal on 8 November 2013.

 7. There are four issues raised in the grounds  of  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal. It is firstly contended that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    erred in his consideration  of  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge who had decided the sponsor's appeal.  It  is  contended
    that the previous Judge did not make a clear finding that the sponsor's
    wife had died. However it is clear from reading  the  determination  of
    Judge Elvridge of 11 May 2011 that he did accept  the  evidence  before
    him that the sponsor's wife had died on the way  to  Ethiopia.  In  any
    event Judge Denson also made an independent  finding  at  paragraph  38
    that, based on the  oral  and  documentary  evidence  before  him,  the
    appellants' mother is deceased. The Judge did not therefore err in  his
    treatment of Judge Elvridge's determination or in his finding that  the
    appellants' mother is dead.

 8. The  grounds  of  appeal  further  contend  that  the  Judge  erred  in
    considering post-decision evidence to the effect that the accommodation
    was available for all five children. However the  Judge  properly  said
    that  the  post-decision  letter  from  the  landlord  could   not   be
    considered. He said that he accepted the oral evidence from the sponsor
    and the appellants' sister that 'at all material times the landlord was
    fully aware that all five children were being sponsored to be  reunited
    with their father'. I am satisfied that this finding was  open  to  the
    Judge on the basis of the  oral  evidence  taken  with  the  landlord's
    letter submitted with the applications. Even if  the  Judge  considered
    the post-decision letter it was clearly considered in relation  to  the
    circumstances as they appertained at the  date  of  the  decision.  The
    Judge did not err in making this finding.

 9. The grounds of appeal contend that the Judge erred in relation  to  his
    findings as to the maintenance requirements. The grounds  contend  that
    the appellants 'seek entry clearance as a unit of  siblings,  as  such,
    the Rules are there to determine if all siblings meet the Rules, not if
    4.5 siblings meet the Rules.' Mr Whitwell submitted that the Judge made
    an artificial distinction between the appellants  in  considering  four
    under the Immigration Rules and separating the fifth  on  an  arbitrary
    basis. He submitted that, as he did not have sufficient funds  for  all
    five children, the sponsor could have selected those who  could  apply.
    He submitted that the ECO was  assessing  the  maintenance  requirement
    based on the income support comparator relating to the sponsor and five
    children as a family unit.

10. Mr Hersi submitted that the wording  of  paragraph  297  says  that  it
    applies to 'a person' seeking to enter the UK. He submitted  that  each
    appellant made an individual application on a separate application form
    and paid a separate fee and that a  separate  decision  was  issued  in
    respect of each appellant who had each lodged  a  separate  appeal.  He
    submitted that one of the children could have chosen not to  appeal  or
    to withdraw the appeal. He submitted that the appeals were separate and
    were  only  considered  together  for  administrative  convenience.  He
    submitted  that  the  Judge  had  made  a  comprehensive  and  thorough
    decision.

11. I accept Mr Hersi's submissions on the issue of maintenance.  I  accept
    that the appellants made separate applications and appeals  which  were
    properly considered by the First-tier Tribunal  Judge.  Each  appellant
    was entitled to a separate decision in relation to his  or  her  appeal
    and the appeals were listed together and a joint  decision  issued  for
    administrative convenience. The Judge was  entitled  to  consider  each
    appeal  separately.  He  did  not  arbitrarily   consider   the   fifth
    appellant's case separately. He made a reasonable decision to  consider
    the appellants on the basis of  their  ages,  although  this  was  less
    straightforward than it may  have  been  as  the  youngest  are  twins.
    However it was reasonable to consider one of the  twins  as  the  fifth
    appellant. As the applications and appeals  were  individual  it  would
    have been perverse for the Judge to have  decided  that  none  of  them
    could meet the maintenance requirements. The Judge made no error in his
    approach to the maintenance requirements of the Immigration Rules.

12. The final issue  raised  in  the  grounds  of  appeal  is  the  Judge's
    assessment under Article 8. It is contended that the  Judge's  decision
    under Article 8 is unsound as it is  erroneously  based  on  the  fifth
    appellant's inability to satisfy the Rules and has been considered on a
    'near miss' basis. In light of my findings above I  am  satisfied  that
    the Judge was right to consider  the  fifth  appellant's  appeal  under
    Article 8. There  is  no  specific  error  identified  in  the  Judge's
    approach to the  Article  8  assessment  and  I  do  not  see  any.  In
    considering family life and the five stages set out  in  R  v  SSHD  ex
    parte Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 the Judge took all  relevant  factors  into
    account and made a decision open to him on the evidence.

Conclusions:

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
