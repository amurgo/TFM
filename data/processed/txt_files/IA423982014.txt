Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis (24.11.15) and Mr T. Melvin (08.01.16),
                             Senior Presenting Officers
For the Respondent/Claimant:    Ms Malhotra, Counsel, instructed by Law &
                             Lawyers Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Youngerwood sitting at  Taylor  House
    on 28 April 2015) allowing the claimant's appeal against  the  decision
    of a Border Force officer to cancel at  port  the  claimant's  existing
    leave to remain as a student and to refuse him  leave  to  enter.   The
    stated justification of the decision was that,  on  the  basis  of  the
    information provided by Educational Testing Service (ETS), his test  of
    English for international communication (TOEIC) test on 16  April  2013
    was taken by proxy and therefore his certificate  was  deemed  invalid.
    He needed the certificate to apply for further leave to remain  in  the
    United Kingdom as a student, and it was considered that he had  thereby
    employed false  representations  and  deception  for  the  purposes  of
    obtaining  such  leave.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an
    anonymity direction, and I do not consider that the  claimant  requires
    to be accorded anonymity for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

The Initial Refusal Permission

 2. It is convenient to refer to the reasons given for  initially  refusing
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal as they  provide  a  helpful
    introduction to the issues which lie at the heart of this  appeal.   On
    16 July 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Osborne refused the Secretary of
    State permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         "1.  The grounds seek permission to appeal a decision  and  reasons
             of First-tier Tribunal Judge Youngerwood who in a decision and
             reasons promulgated 14 May 2015 allowed the Appellant's appeal
             against the Respondent's decision to refuse leave to enter the
             UK under the Immigration Rules.

         2.   The grounds assert that the Judge erred in law in  failing  to
             give adequate reasons for findings on a material matter.   The
             Judge failed to reason the finding  that  the  Respondent  has
             totally failed to provide clear evidence as to what tests took
             place in relation to  this  particular  Appellant,  making  it
             impossible to judge the reliability of any such tests  in  the
             circumstances.  The Respondent provided at appeal a bundle  of
             documents  in  support  of  the  allegation  (in  respect   of
             paragraph  321A  Immigration  Rules).   Additionally   witness
             statements and an email from ETS Task Force dated 10 September
             2014 were adduced.  In the light of the evidence it  is  clear
             that the Judge erred in the above findings.  It is clear  from
             the evidence that where ETS invalidates the test result, as in
             this case, it is because  there  is  evidence  of  proxy  test
             taking or impersonation.  The Judge failed entirely to provide
             adequate reasons for finding to the contrary.

         3.   In  a  careful  and  forensically  nuanced  and  well-reasoned
             determination the Judge set out the pertinent issues, law  and
             evidence relating to the facts of the appeal.  In  appeals  of
             this nature it is the task of the Judge to  make  findings  of
             fact on the basis of the evidence and  to  provide  adequately
             clear reasons for those findings.  That is precisely what  the
             Judge did.   The  Judge  scrutinised  the  evidence  of  Peter
             Millington and Rebecca Collings.  If the  whole  decision  and
             reasons is read and given full context, the Judge's finding at
             [29] is better understood.  The Judge properly and  adequately
             set out the reasons for his findings at [24, 25,  26,  27  and
             28].  When the contents of those paragraphs  are  given  their
             full effect, the meaning of [29] is adequately clear."

The Eventual Grant of Permission

 3. On a renewed application to the Upper Tribunal,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Chalkley granted permission for the following reasons:

         "I think that it may be  possible  that  the  judge  has  erred  by
         failing to properly understand and appreciate the evidence  of  the
         two witnesses."

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 4. Both parties were represented before Judge Youngerwood, and  the  judge
    received oral evidence from the claimant.  He confirmed  attending  the
    test centre on 16 April 2013 and taking the speaking and writing tests,
    with a two hour break, before  then  taking  the  listening  test.   He
    stated he had to show his photograph identification at the  centre  and
    that photographs were taken of him there.  He left the test  centre  in
    the evening.  In cross-examination, he  stated  he  did  not  have  any
    evidence of CCTV footage.  There were a total  of  some  60  candidates
    taking the exams, in three rooms, and eighteen of  those  were  in  the
    room he was in.  He had chosen the test centre because it was close  to
    his home.  He had not personally gone to ETS after the cancellation  of
    his leave to question the allegations. He had returned  to  the  UK  in
    October 2014 when he was stopped, and ETS had now closed.  He  did  not
    question the allegation with the governing body.  His current two  year
    course had started in March 2014.

 5. In his subsequent decision, the judge set out  the  evidence,  and  the
    competing cases  of  the  claimant  and  the  Secretary  of  State,  in
    considerable  detail,  before  going  on  to  state  his  findings   at
    paragraphs [22] onwards.  I reproduce these findings below:

         "22. This appeal was listed as a 'float' and, frankly, should never
             have  been  so  categorised.   There  were   complicated   and
             difficult factual issues to be resolved  and  whilst,  in  the
             event, I allowed  some  time  for  consideration  and  further
             inquiries to be made, this was not an ideal solution.

         23.  One point made, in her submissions,  by  Ms  Malhotra  can  be
             fairly easily dealt with.  She referred to  the  evidence,  at
             paragraph 29 of the witness Rebecca  Collings,  to  raise  the
             possibility that the appellant's leave had been cancelled  due
             to suspicion and suggestion only, as some candidates had  been
             listed as 'questionable'.  However, that assertion is not made
             out.  It is clear from the  spreadsheets  provided  before  me
             that the appellant was listed as  'invalid',  and,  therefore,
             the assertion was that testing had been carried  out  and  the
             view taken that there had been abuse in the form of a proxy.

         24.  The use of  generic  statements,  as  in  this  case,  is  not
             uncommon in appeals before  this  Tribunal,  especially  where
             there  are  allegations  of  widespread  abuse  in  particular
             testing centres, or, in general, over  many  testing  centres.
             As stated above, the appellant is clearly identified as having
             been the subject of testing and a conclusion by  ETS  that  he
             has used abuse to obtain his TOEIC result  in  2013.   Without
             knowing the result of the judicial  review  proceedings  there
             is, on the face of it, sufficient evidence before me to assess
             that  the  testing   quality,   based   on   biometric   voice
             recognition, is reliable.

         25.  However, however complicated the  process  used  to  undertake
             testing, at the end of the day, this Tribunal  must  be  in  a
             position to know what testing was carried out in  relation  to
             the particular appellant before it, and  to  then  assess  the
             reliability of that testing.  What can certainly  be  inferred
             is  that  voice  recognition  samples  were   obtained,   and,
             therefore, were tested, based  on  the  person  who  took  the
             speaking and reading tests  at  the  centre  on  the  date  in
             question, on 16 April 2013.  During the course of the  hearing
             and submissions, I invited Ms Choudry  to  address  me  on  an
             issue, which appeared to be absolutely  vital  -  namely  what
             other sample or samples were checked to  justify  the  result.
             Clearly, any other samples  checked,  as  with  a  fingerprint
             check,  must  be  proven  to  be  that   of   the   appellant.
             Notwithstanding her best efforts, and, possibly,  affected  by
             the fact that this was a float case, she was unable to do more
             than submit that the tests must have  been  based  on  samples
             relating to the suspect.  However, having again looked at  the
             written evidence before me, I am still totally unaware of what
             samples, identified as coming from the appellant, were checked
             with the voice samples clearly obtainable from the tests taken
             on 16 April 2013.  The appellant has  confirmed  that  he  has
             taken two other tests, one in Lahore, and one subsequently  in
             2014.  However, unless I have missed  a  very  obvious  point,
             those could not be the sources of the samples tested,  because
             Mr  Millington  in  his  witness  statement,  makes  it  clear
             (paragraph  19)   that   the   individual   electronic   files
             transmitted and stored to or by ETS are in relation  to  tests
             'administered in the UK' - so that this would not relate to  a
             test taken in Pakistan or, so it seems to me, in  relation  to
             the subsequent IELTS test, taken on  15  March  2014,  because
             that test was not administered by ETS.

         26.  Whether I am right or wrong in surmising what other  sample(s)
             were used to conclude that the appellant had used a proxy, the
             simple fact remains that, nowhere in  the  statements,  is  it
             plainly  and  simply  stated,  what  other  samples,   clearly
             identified in relation to the appellant, were used.  If  other
             samples  were  not  used,  then,  again,  the  basis  of   the
             conclusion that a proxy had been used is  simply  not  stated.
             This is simply not good enough.  The burden of proof is on the
             respondent and, given the consequences  for  an  appellant  in
             relation to their educational progress, the  burden  of  proof
             must be strictly complied with.  I cannot  see  any  practical
             reason whereby, the  most  complicated  generic  statement  or
             statements, cannot be accompanied, or include, in clear terms,
             the basis on which the individual appellant, whose  appeal  is
             being dealt with, was assessed to have used a proxy,  if  that
             is the allegation.

         27.  Quite apart from my concerns about the documentation  provided
             before me, the respondent  has  not  answered  the  assertion,
             whether true or not, raised in the appeal grounds, that  there
             was a CCTV recording of him at the  actual  premises  when  he
             took the test.

         28.  The fact that the appellant has taken previous and  subsequent
             English Language tests, whilst indicative of  his  ability  to
             speak English, which he did before me at the appeal, does  not
             necessarily mean that  a  proxy  could  not  have  been  used,
             whether because of a lack of confidence  or  for  convenience.
             All the above matters emphasise the importance of having clear
             evidence of what  samples  were  used  to  conclude  that  the
             appellant had used a proxy.  It seems to me that that  testing
             might have been easier  than  with  others,  for  the  obvious
             reason that the appellant spoke with  a  fairly  frequent  and
             marked stammer before me - this may possibly be in  situations
             of stress, but that would likely also  be  a  situation  where
             this appellant took a reading or speaking test.

         29.  At the end of the day, because of the reasons provided  above,
             the respondent in my view has totally failed to provide  clear
             evidence as to what tests  took  place  in  relation  to  this
             particular  appellant,  making  it  impossible  to  judge  the
             reliability of any such tests, in such circumstances."

The Error of Law Hearing

 6. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Mr Jarvis directed my attention to the  passages  in  the  witness
    statements of Mr Millington and Ms Collings on  which  he  particularly
    relied.  Ms Malhotra referred me to Gazi v Secretary of State  for  the
    Home Department (ETS - judicial review) IJR [2015] UKUT 00327 (IAC) and
    to R (Ali and Mehmood) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 744.  She submitted  that
    the judge had rightly considered the particular  circumstances  of  the
    claimant,  and  if  he  had  misunderstood  the  Secretary  of  State's
    evidence, the error was not material.  He had still reached a  decision
    that was reasonably open to him on the totality of the evidence.

 7. I found that an error of law was made out, and gave my reasons  for  so
    finding in short form, with written  reasons  to  follow.  The  parties
    agreed that there should be a further hearing before me to  remake  the
    decision, and it was provisionally agreed (subject to listing) that the
    hearing would be at the beginning of January 2016.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

 8. Giving the leading judgment in the Ali and  Mehmood  case,  Beatson  LJ
    said at paragraph [24] that in February 2014 the  television  programme
    Panorama revealed, using covert recording, that  there  was  widespread
    fraud in the taking of language tests, in  particular  by  the  use  of
    proxy test takers.  As a result of this, ETS reviewed  all  its  tests.
    It did so using computerised voice recognition software and two reviews
    by anti-fraud staff trained in voice recognition.  ETS  concluded  that
    thousands of tests, including Mr Ali's test, had not been taken by  the
    person who was named on the certificate but by another person.

 9. At paragraph [25], Beatson LJ noted that the Secretary of State  relied
    on the witness statements, both dated 23 June 2014, of Rebecca Collings
    and Peter Millington, which had originally been  filed  in  proceedings
    brought by Zaheer Hussain Mohammed, and  which  had  subsequently  been
    relied on in all cases in defence of challenges to removal decisions on
    the ground of deception in  language  testing  and  TOEIC  certificates
    issued by ETS.  Beatson LJ continued in paragraph [26]:

         "These   statements   describe   the   way   anti-fraud    measures
         (particularly online verification systems) were introduced, and the
         steps  taken  following  the  'Panorama'  programme  and  the  Home
         Office's contact with ETS, and why the Home Office  accepted  that,
         where ETS had cancelled a test score because of  impersonation  and
         proxy test taking, that test score had been obtained by  deception.
         Mr Millington stated that ETS's statistics bore out the  underlying
         reliability of the voice biometrics technology, and the reason  the
         Home Office considered that, where ETS  identifies  positive  voice
         matches for two candidates with different names, it is because  one
         person has sat the speaking and writing exam for  both  candidates.
         That, he stated,  is  clear  evidence  that  both  candidates  have
         fraudulently  obtained  their  TOEIC   certificate   and   employed
         deception in their application for leave to remain.  In R (Gazi)  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department (ETS - judicial  review)
         [2015]  UKUT  00327  (IAC)  at  6  and  9,  the  President  of  the
         Immigration and  Asylum  Chamber  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  (UTIAC)
         described these as 'generic' witness statements, because  they  did
         not show the exact reason why ETS invalidated the certificate of  a
         particular person or provide  evidence  relating  to  the  personal
         circumstances of an individual."

10. One of the issues in Gazi was whether the Secretary of State's reliance
    on the generic evidence of Mr Millington and Ms Collings was  compliant
    with the following published guidance, which  is  quoted  at  paragraph
    [28] of Gazi:

         "The evidence must always prove to a  high  degree  of  probability
         that deception had been used to gain the leave, whether or  not  an
         admission of deception is made.  The  onus  -  as  always  in  such
         situations - is on the officer making the assertion  to  prove  his
         case."

    The President said as follows at paragraph [35]:

         "In my view, taking  into  account  Chapter  50  of  the  EIG,  the
         respondent's  evidence,  summarised  in  Chapter  II   above,   was
         sufficient to warrant the assessment that the applicant's TOEIC had
         been  procured  by  deception  and,  thus,  provided  an   adequate
         foundation for the decision made under Section 10 of the 1999  Act.
         True it is that,  at  this  remove  and  with  the  benefit  of  Dr
         Harrison's report, there may be grounds for  contending  that  said
         evidence is not infallible, and there may  be  sufficient  material
         for a lively debate about its  various  ingredients  ...   For  the
         purpose of disposing of this ground of  challenge  and  bearing  in
         mind that the jurisdiction being exercised is  one  of  supervisory
         review rather than merits appeal, it suffices for this Tribunal  to
         be satisfied that the evidence upon which the impugned decision was
         made has the hallmarks of care, thoroughness, underlying  expertise
         and sufficient reliability.  The  cornerstone  of  the  applicant's
         case is that the evidence was insufficient  for  this  purpose.   I
         reject this challenge."

11. The claimant before me was pursuing a merits-based appeal, and  it  was
    open to the First-tier Tribunal judge to find on the  particular  facts
    of his case that the Secretary of State had not discharged  the  burden
    of proving that the TOEIC certificate had not been obtained through the
    use of a proxy text taker, and thus the claimant's leave to remain as a
    student had not been procured by deception.  But the reasoning  of  the
    judge in paragraphs [25] and  [26]  shows  that  he  misunderstood  the
    evidence relied on by the Secretary of State.  As summarised by Beatson
    LJ in the Ali and Mehmood case, the methodology used  to  identify  the
    use of a proxy test taker  in  any  given  case  is  to  compare  voice
    recordings to see  if  there  is  an  identical  match.  This  involves
    comparing the voice recording for Candidate  A  with  voice  recordings
    made on other occasions. Unless Candidate A has sat the  same  language
    test on two separate occasions, there should not be  another  recording
    with an identical match to Candidate A's voice.

12. Matthew Harold, who has been employed by the Home Office  as  a  senior
    caseworker since February 2014,  made  a  witness  statement  with  the
    claimant's appeal reference on it (as the judge noted at  paragraph  10
    of his decision) and he thus gave evidence which was  specific  to  the
    claimant.  Mr Harold confirmed  that  the  claimant  was  one  of  many
    individuals in respect of whom leave to enter was refused by  the  Home
    Office  following  the  invalidation  of  his  English  language   test
    certificate by ETS.  He  confirmed  that  the  test  results  had  been
    cancelled by ETS because its own analyses indicated the test result had
    been obtained by the use of a proxy tester.  This was notified  by  way
    of an entry on a spreadsheet copy, which was attached to his  statement
    as Annex A.

13. The judge found  that  this  spreadsheet,  and  a  further  spreadsheet
    produced during the  course  of  the  appeal,  clearly  identified  the
    claimant's test result, following the purported test on 16 April  2013,
    as being invalid.

14. As stated by the judge at the beginning of  paragraph  [25],  what  can
    certainly be inferred from that representation by ETS  was  that  voice
    recognition samples were obtained, and were therefore tested, based  on
    the person who took the speaking and reading tests at the centre on the
    date in question.

15. What the judge apparently failed to appreciate was that the  sample  of
    the candidate  purporting  to  be  the  claimant  was  checked  against
    numerous other samples of other candidates who did not  purport  to  be
    him, in order to see whether there was a  match.   Instead,  the  judge
    proceeded on the wholly erroneous  premise  that  the  voice  recording
    which purported to relate to the claimant was checked, or  should  have
    been checked, against other identifiable recordings of  the  claimant's
    voice, which were known to be authentic and reliable.

16. The judge thus criticises the Secretary of State's evidence for a  non-
    existent defect, as the evidence  does  not  purport  to  be  based  on
    identifiable discrepancies between the  candidate's  actual  voice  (as
    reliably recorded on one or more other occasions) and the voice of  the
    speaker who sat the language test.

17. As a consequence, the judge has not given adequate reasons for  holding
    that the Secretary of State's  evidence  against  the  claimant,  which
    included not  only  the  generic  evidence  of  Mr  Millington  and  Ms
    Collings, but  also  the  specific  evidence  of  Mr  Harold,  did  not
    constitute clear prima facie evidence that  the  claimant  had  used  a
    proxy.  By the same token, the judge was wrong to hold that the failure
    to state what other samples of the claimant's voice had  been  used  to
    compare with the sample taken on 16 April 2013 made it  impossible  for
    him to judge the reliability of the exercise which had been carried out
    in respect of the claimant.  On the contrary, as established inter alia
    in Gazi, the generic evidence relied on by the Secretary  of  State  in
    these cases is prima facie reliable, and  this  should  have  been  the
    judge's starting point.

18. Accordingly, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is vitiated  by  a
    material error of law, such that it must be set aside and remade.

The Resumed Hearing on 8 January 2016

19. The appellant was called as a witness, and he adopted as his  evidence-
    in-chief the same witness statement which he  had  adopted  before  the
    First-tier  Tribunal.   In  total  he  had  attended  three  interviews
    conducted by Immigration Officers, "To determine  my  English  language
    competency".  He was told by the Immigration  Officer  that  they  were
    happy with his command of English.  He  had  taken  an  IELTS  test  in
    Pakistan in order to obtain entry clearance to follow a level 5 course.
     In June 2003 he applied for leave to remain in  the  UK  to  follow  a
    level 6 course, and he wanted to take the IELTS test again.  But  there
    were no vacancies at the test centre, as they were  fully  booked.   He
    checked on line with the website but the TOIEC was an alternative  test
    that was acceptable to UKBA.  He located a centre near where  he  lived
    to sit for the test.

20. After obtaining his TOEIC certificate, he completed his level 6 course.
     In April 2014 he wanted to progress to level 7.  In his interview with
    his prospective new college, he sought to rely on his TOEIC certificate
    as evidence of his English language competency.  But  he  was  told  to
    take another English test, as the Home Office were not accepting  TOEIC
    certificates.  He did a second IELTS test,  and  passed  it  with  good
    grades.

21. In his oral evidence, he had confirmed that he had taken  the  test  at
    the Premier Language Training Centre in Barking on 16 April  2013.   He
    attended at 8am in the morning, when he produced his ID.  He  initially
    said they started at 9.  He then said  they  started  at  9.30  with  a
    speaking test.  He indicated that the speaking  and  writing  test  had
    lasted some two hours altogether.  He clarified that the speaking  test
    had taken about half an hour.  He said it might have been as  short  as
    eighteen minutes.  It involved looking at  pictures  on  a  screen  and
    explaining what he could see.  There were ten to fifteen others in  the
    room.  They each had headphones, and a microphone was installed in each
    of the headphone sets.  There was a  break  between  the  speaking  and
    writing tests.  They brought him a keyboard, and  they  gave  them  "an
    essay" shown on the computer screen to explain.   There  were  actually
    two different topics which he  had  to  address.   This  exercise  took
    fifteen to twenty minutes.  He had a two hour break.  They gave him the
    option of doing the  remainder  of  the  test  the  following  day,  or
    straight after the two hour break, or in the evening.  He chose  to  do
    it as soon as possible.  He had gone out to eat  something  during  the
    two hour break.

22. The next series of tests started between 1 and 2pm.  Neither of the two
    remaining tests, reading and listening, involved the use of a  computer
    or headphones.  The reading test involved reading a handout,  and  then
    answering questions which were printed on the handout.   He  wrote  out
    the answers to the questions in manuscript.  It took 40 to 45  minutes,
    and there were 30 or 40 people in the room.  The  listening  test  also
    took about 45 minutes.  They played a CD for everyone in the hall,  and
    they gave them a sheet to write down the answers to the questions  they
    were given.

23. In cross-examination, the appellant said that the test  for  the  TOEIC
    certificate had cost him between �160 and �180.  He could not  remember
    the precise figure.  He had not kept a receipt  for  the  payment.   He
    finished between 4 and 5pm.  He could not  recall  the  nature  of  the
    photographs that he was asked  to  explain  for  the  purposes  of  the
    speaking test. He confirmed that the questions he was asked  about  the
    photographs which were shown on the screen were also on the screen.

24. It was put to him  that  at  his  interview  at  Gatwick  he  had  told
    Immigration Officers that the first set of tests had taken two to three
    hours in the morning, and the second set of  tests  had  taken  two  to
    three hours in the evening.  He agreed that in fact the second  set  of
    tests had taken place in the afternoon.  His explanation  was  that  he
    had just come off a long flight.

25. In re-examination, he agreed that the interview in question  had  taken
    place at Gatwick a week after his arrival.  He had made a mistake.  The
    second set of tests had taken place in the afternoon between 2 and 4.

26. In his closing submissions on behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State,  Mr
    Melvin relied on the additional evidence that had been produced  by  Mr
    Jarvis at the  previous  hearing,  which  was  a  report  by  Detective
    Inspector Andrew Carter of the Immigration and Enforcement Criminal and
    Financial Investigation  team  dated  5  May  2012  about  the  Premier
    Language Training Centre in Barking.  On the topic of  the  appellant's
    oral evidence, he submitted that the appellant had been unable to  give
    a coherent explanation of the speaking  test,  and  what  it  entailed.
    Furthermore, his account of what had taken place at the hearing  centre
    during the day was at best vague.

27. In reply, Ms Malhotra submitted that the appellant  had  given  a  very
    detailed account of what the tests had entailed, and he had  been  very
    fluent.  As had been highlighted by the expert  evidence  discussed  in
    Gazi, there were flaws  in  the  generic  evidence  relied  on  by  the
    Secretary of State, and the consequences of a false positive were  dire
    for someone such as the appellant.  He was a bona fide student,  and  a
    vital link was missing in the Secretary  of  State's  case,  which  was
    motive. He had no  motive  for  using  a  proxy  when  he  clearly  had
    sufficient competency in English not to require the use of a  proxy  in
    order to acquire a TOEIC certificate.  As the appellant could not  gain
    access to the recordings on which the allegation of use of a proxy were
    based, the Tribunal  was  not  the  fairest  forum  for  examining  the
    allegation of dishonest use of a proxy.

Discussion and Findings on Remaking

28. In The Queen (On the application Of Bijendra Giri) v Secretary of State
    [2015] EWCA Civ 784 Richards LJ reviewed two reported decisions of  the
    Upper Tribunal on the issue of standard  of  proof  at  paragraph  [35]
    onwards.  The Upper Tribunal had been wrong in JC  (Part  9  HC  395  -
    burden of proof) China [2007] UKAIT 0027 to hold that the  standard  of
    proof in relation to a question of deception will be at the higher  end
    of the spectrum of balance of probability.  The law had been  correctly
    stated in NA and Others (Cambridge College of Learning) Pakistan [2009]
    UKAIT 0031.  The seriousness of the  consequences  did  not  require  a
    different standard of proof, citing  Lord  Hoffman  in  Re  B  Children
    [2008] UKHL 35 where he said at paragraph [15]:

         "... there is only one rule of law, and only the occurrence of  the
         fact and issue must be proved to be more probable than not.  Common
         sense, not law, requires that in  deciding  this  question,  regard
         should  be  had,  to  whatever  extent  appropriate,  to   inherent
         probabilities."

29. Detective Inspector Andrew Carter explains that  Project  Fa�ade  is  a
    nationwide Home Office criminal enquiry into the  abuse  of  the  TOEIC
    exam.  As part of this enquiry,  21  separate  criminal  investigations
    have taken place into specific test centres which have been prioritised
    according to a number of factors, including high test  volumes,  audits
    that  highlighted  cheating  and  other  intelligence  and  information
    indicated widespread abuse  of  the  exam.   The  criminal  enquiry  at
    Premier Language Training Centre in Barking has revealed  that  between
    20 May 2012 and 5 February 2014, Premier Language undertook 5,055 TOEIC
    speaking and writing tests at which ETS identified the following:

           . Invalid 3,780

           . Questionable 1,275

           . Not withdrawn (no evidence of invalidity) 0

           . Percentage invalid 75%

30. The following information, although not  covering  the  entire  testing
    period, was provided in support of  and  to  corroborate  the  analysis
    completed by ETS to show the "organised and widespread"  abuse  of  the
    TOEIC that took place at this test centre.  On 18  September  2013  ETS
    carried out an audit inspection during which  a  test  centre  employee
    admitted that cheating took place.  Documents relating to  TOEIC  exams
    were discovered during a search on 16 June 2014.  They list  the  tests
    taken between 19 November 2013 to 5 February  2014  that  involved  167
    candidates,  all  of  which  the  Home  Office  were   satisfied   were
    fraudulent.  Alongside the names of the candidates were  the  names  of
    "pilots" (imposters) who sat the test  on  behalf  of  the  candidates.
    There were also the names of agents who were suspected as acting as the
    middle men in the deception.  Analysis of telecom devices  seized  from
    test centre employees revealed numerous SMS messages discussing the use
    of "pilots".

31. Detective Inspector Carter concludes  by  saying  this  is  an  ongoing
    criminal investigation, and revealing further information may prejudice
    future prosecutions.

32. As Ms Malhotra submits, the appellant is plainly not  one  of  the  167
    candidates whose name was found on a list next to the name of  a  pilot
    who sat the test on his behalf.  The period to which this list  relates
    started some months after the date when the appellant  claims  to  have
    attended the test centre to  sit  the  test.   However,  the  appellant
    purportedly took the test in the period between 20  March  2012  and  5
    February 2014 in respect  of  which  75%  of  tests  were  assessed  as
    invalid, and the remainder were  assessed  as  questionable.   This  is
    consistent with there being organised and widespread abuse in place  at
    the  test  centre,  with  the  connivance  of  test  centre  employees.
    Supplementary evidence of widespread abuse has  been  obtained  in  the
    form of an admission from a test centre  employee  that  cheating  took
    place, and the discovery of the highly incriminating list  referred  to
    in paragraph 14 of the report.

33. As was held by the President in the case of  Gazi  at  paragraph  [35],
    "With the benefit of Dr Harrison's report, there  may  be  grounds  for
    contending  the  [generic]  evidence  is  not  infallible".   But   the
    Secretary of State's evidence does  not  need  to  be  infallible.  The
    generic evidence relied on before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  taken  in
    conjunction with  the  additional  evidence  now  relied  on  which  is
    specific to the Premier Language Training Centre,  discloses  a  strong
    prima facie case against the appellant that a proxy  sat  the  speaking
    element of the test on his behalf.

34. The explanatory rubric on the back of the appellant's first IELTS  test
    explains Bands 5 and 6 as follows.  Band  5  corresponds  to  a  modest
    user, who has a partial command of the language,  coping  with  overall
    meaning in most situations, though is likely  to  make  many  mistakes.
    They should be able to handle basic communication in own field.  Band 6
    is a competent  user,  who  has  generally  effective  command  of  the
    language,   despite   some    inaccuracies,    "inappropriacies"    and
    misunderstandings.  Can usually  understand  fairly  complex  language,
    particularly in familiar situations.

35. The appellant took his first  IELTS  test  on  19  November  2010.   He
    achieved scores of 6.0 listening and reading,  and  scores  of  5.0  in
    writing and speaking, giving him an overall band score of 5.5.

36. The appellant took his second IELTS test on 27 March 2014, in which  he
    showed a modest improvement from his  earlier  test  scores.   In  each
    category, he had improved his grade by 0.5.   In  speaking,  he  scored
    5.5.  His overall band score was 6.0.

37. The IELTS scoring system has three higher bands, Bands 7 to 9.  Band  7
    is a good user, Band 8 is a very good user, and Band  9  is  an  expert
    user.

38. Although the TOEIC scoring system is different from that of the  IELTS,
    it is possible to draw some meaningful comparisons from the explanatory
    rubric in the TOEIC official score report.  The highest score that  the
    appellant could have obtained for speaking was  200.  He  was  given  a
    score of 190, and assessed as having a proficiency level of 8, which is
    the highest proficiency level available under the TOEIC scoring system.
     The explanatory rubric states as follows about the significance  of  a
    level 8 scale score range between 190 and 200:

         'Typically, test takers at level 8 can create connected,  sustained
         discourse appropriate to the typical workplace.  When they  express
         opinions or respond to complicated requests, their speech is highly
         intelligible.  Their use of basic and complex grammar is  good  and
         their use of vocabulary is accurate and precise.

         Test takers at level 8 can  also  use  spoken  language  to  answer
         questions and give basic information.

         Their pronunciation and intonation and  stress  are  at  all  times
         highly intelligible.'

39. On the face  of  it,  the  level  of  proficiency  that  the  appellant
    purportedly displayed in the TOEIC test is significantly  greater  than
    that which he displayed in his second IELTS test, eleven months  later.
    Furthermore, his account of what the speaking test  allegedly  involved
    does not correlate with what he is supposed to  have  been  tested  on,
    according to the explanatory rubric.  It is very difficult to see  from
    his  account  how  he  displayed  proficiency  in  creating  connected,
    sustained discourse appropriate for the typical workplace,  or  how  he
    displayed  highly  intelligible  speech  when  expressing  opinions  or
    responding to complicated requests.

40. In addition, the explanatory rubric makes specific reference to reading
    aloud.  The certificate states that when reading aloud, the appellant's
    pronunciation was highly intelligible.  But his account of his  testing
    did not involve any reading aloud.  According to  him,  he  was  simply
    shown photographs  and  asked  to  respond  to  questions  about  these
    photographs that were written on the screen.

41. I accept that the appellant was being asked to recall details of a test
    he  claimed  to  have  sat  some  time  ago,  which  placed  him  at  a
    disadvantage.   I  also  accept  that  the  appellant  had   sufficient
    competency in the English language, including in speaking and  writing,
    in order to be able to follow a course of study at level 7.  So he  did
    not need to cheat  in  order  to  demonstrate  the  required  level  of
    competency in the English language in order to continue  his  education
    in the UK as a student.

42. Nonetheless, having considered all the available evidence, I find  that
    the Secretary of State has discharged the burden of  proving  that  the
    appellant obtained his TOEIC certificate  fraudulently,  and  therefore
    his appeal must be dismissed.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the  decision  is  set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is
substituted: the appellant's appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
