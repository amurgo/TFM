                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008  (SI  2008/2698)  I  make  an  anonymity  order  prohibiting   the
    disclosure or publication of any matter likely to lead  to  members  of
    the public identifying the appellant.  A failure to  comply  with  this
    direction could lead to Contempt of Court proceedings.



Introduction

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who was born on 28 April 1976.

 3. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 17  June  2019.   On  23
    September 2019 she attended the Asylum Intake Unit in  Croydon.   On  1
    October 2019, the appellant claimed asylum.

 4. The basis of the appellant's claim was that she would  be  at  risk  on
    return to Nigeria because she is bisexual.  She claimed  that  she  had
    been caught in a compromising situation  with  another  woman  by  that
    woman's husband on 15 or 16 May 2018.  The incident was reported to the
    appellant's husband and on 17 May 2018 she was questioned at  a  police
    station about her sexuality.  She was warned by the police not to carry
    out similar activities in the future.   Subsequently,  on  12  December
    2018 whilst she was on her way home, she was shouted at by some  people
    in her local area and when she went to the police station  to  lodge  a
    complaint she was harassed and they  were  hostile  to  her.   She  was
    subsequently warned by her husband that if  she  returned  to  Nigeria,
    after she had come to the UK, for a holiday, he would report her to the
    authorities.  On 25 July 2019, her sister called her and told her  that
    some people had  confronted  her  husband  about  her  sexuality.   The
    appellant claimed that on return  she  feared  that  her  husband,  her
    girlfriend's husband and her neighbour would report her to the Nigerian
    authorities who would ill-treat her.

 5. On 29 November 2019, the Secretary of  State  refused  the  appellant's
    claims  for  asylum,  humanitarian  protection  and  under  the   ECHR.
    Principally, the Secretary  of  State  did  not  accept  that  she  was
    bisexual or that her account of events in Nigeria was credible.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a  determination
    sent on 16 March 2020,  Judge  A  J  Blake  dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal.  He made an adverse credibility finding and did not accept that
    the appellant was bisexual or that her account of events in Nigeria was
    true.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 7. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  on  a
    number of grounds.  Permission was initially refused by the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Adio) on 18 May 2020.  On renewal of  that  application
    to the Upper  Tribunal,  on  21  July  2020  the  Upper  Tribunal  (UTJ
    Blundell) granted the appellant permission to appeal.

 8. Following the grant of permission, on 16 September 2020  the  Secretary
    of State filed a rule 24 response seeking to uphold the decision.

 9. Following an initial adjournment of a  remote  hearing  on  3  November
    2020, the appeal was listed at the Cardiff Civil Justice Centre  for  a
    remote hearing by Skype for Business.  The court was  working  remotely
    and Mr Onipede, who represented the appellant, and Mr  C  Howells,  who
    represented the Secretary of State, also joined the  hearing  by  Skype
    for Business.

The Grant of Permission

10. In granting permission to appeal, UTJ Blundell limited the grant to two
    specific  points  relating  to  paras  81  and  85   of   the   judge's
    determination.

11. In para 81 Judge Blake, in finding the appellant not  to  be  credible,
    said this:

         "I also note that the appellant has not made any mention  of  being
         harassed by the  police  at  the  time  of  her  initial  screening
         interview.  I noted this formed a major part of her claim.  I found
         that it had undermined her  credibility  that  she  had  failed  to
         mention it at the early stage."

12. In granting permission to appeal, UTJ Blundell said this:

         "It is arguable that Judge Blake erred when he concluded  at  [81],
         that the appellant had not made any mention of  being  harassed  by
         the  police  at  the  time  of  her  initial  screening  interview.
         Although there is no mention of police harassment in the  interview
         itself, the conduct described in the witness  statement  which  was
         adduced at that interview might aptly be described as harassment."

13. Then, at para 85  of  his  determination  Judge  Blake  considered  the
    evidence, given orally, by  the  appellant's  cousin,  Mr  Aminu.   His
    evidence was supportive of the appellant's  account  and  claim  to  be
    bisexual.  The judge said this:

         "I considered the evidence of the appellant's cousin, Mr Aminu.   I
         found his evidence also lacked credibility.  I noted in his witness
         statement of 11 January 2020 he had made no mention of a number  of
         important issues.  I noted in evidence he had stated that his  wife
         had discovered the appellant's sexual orientation and demanded that
         she leave their home.  I  noted  this  was  not  mentioned  in  his
         witness statement.  I further noted that he claimed in his  witness
         statement that the appellant had originally stayed with him in  his
         home until his wife had found out about her sexuality and  that  he
         had then let her live in his offices.  I noted that  this  had  not
         been mentioned in the witness statement.  I further noted  that  on
         one account he stated that both he and his wife paid the  rent  for
         the appellant of �550 per month.  I noted he had  stated  that  the
         accommodation the appellant was in was a three-bedroomed house that
         was rented by him.  In contrast, I noted  that  the  appellant  had
         stated in evidence that he was living in a bedsit."

14. In granting permission to appeal, UTJ Blundell said this in relation to
    the second half of that paragraph:

         "It is also arguable that the judge misunderstood the evidence when
         he made the findings he did at [85], concerning the evidence  of  a
         witness.  I cannot read the Record of Proceedings.   The  complaint
         does not prove itself and, if it is to be maintained, there must be
         proper evidence to show that the judge fell into the error claimed.
          A witness statement from the appellant's advocate,  together  with
         his contemporaneous  record  of  the  evidence  may  suffice.   The
         advocate must obviously not appear at  the  hearing  of  the  Upper
         Tribunal."

15. In response  to  that  grant  of  permission,  the  appellant  filed  a
    statement from Mr Edward Akoheni dated 2 October 2020  who  represented
    the appellant before the judge.  At  paras  4  and  5  of  his  witness
    statement he says this:

         "(4)   Unfortunately I have a practise of disposing of my Record of
             Proceeding once a determination is promulgated in case I  have
             been instructed.  However my recollection of the evidence from
             Mr Aminu is that his oral evidence was that the appellant  was
             staying in his matrimonial home prior to his wife  discovering
             the appellant's sexuality.

         (5)  Mr Aminu then  stated  in  evidence  that  he  was  forced  to
             accommodate the appellant in his office  for  a  short  period
             because he secured a tenancy for the  appellant.   Finally  Mr
             Aminu made two clear statements in his oral evidence.  Firstly
             he stated that he alone paid for the monthly rent  of  �550.00
             for the bedsit that the appellant was living in.  Secondly, Mr
             Aminu stated that both he and his wife paid jointly for  their
             three- bedroom property rent.  He did not  mention  an  amount
             for the three-bedroom property in oral evidence."

16. Mr Howells was content that this evidence, not in evidence  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal, should  be  admitted  under  rule  15(2A)  of  the
    Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  (SI  2008/2698  as
    amended).

The Submissions

17. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Onipede submitted  that  the  judge  had
    materially erred in law in both paras 81 and 85 of his determination.

18. As regards para  81,  Mr  Onipede  submitted  that  the  appellant  had
    referred to the police harassing her prior to the  Screening  Interview
    in her statement dated 1 October 2019.  He relied upon para 8 where she
    said this:

         "Around December  2018  I  was  confronted  on  the  road  by  some
         neighbours who were aware of the incident of 16 May 2018,  attacked
         and embarrassed me on the street for being bisexual.  I went to the
         police to report but the police were  very  aggressive  to  me  and
         abused me for whom I am.  Immediately I saw their response to me  I
         quickly left the station as they have started threatening to detain
         me.  At the police station the officers recognised me  and  started
         abusing me for being a lesbian  even  before  I  could  report  the
         attack I suffered.  I had to run out of the station without lodging
         my complaint."

19. In his opening submissions, Mr Onipede submitted  that  it  was  plain,
    therefore, that the judge had  been  wrong  to  take  into  account  in
    assessing the appellant's credibility that  she  had  not  referred  to
    harassment by the police prior to her screening interview on 21 October
    2019.  He referred me to the respondent's decision letter at page 75 of
    the Home Office  bundle  which  referred  to  the  appellant's  witness
    statement dated 1 October 2019.  He also referred to  page  26  of  the
    bundle which referred to the appellant submitting her witness statement
    at the asylum interview (although he did not at this point recognise it
    was not her Screening Interview),.  He submitted, therefore,  that  the
    appellant had at the time of the Screening Interview mentioned that she
    had been harassed by the police and the judge had made a material error
    in para 81 when he had counted against her in assessing  credible  that
    she had not done so.

20. In response, Mr Howells submitted that  the  judge  had  not  made  any
    factual error.  Although the statement of the  appellant  was  dated  1
    October 2019, he submitted that it had not been provided  to  the  Home
    Office prior to the Screening  Interview.   He  pointed  out  that  the
    reference, to which Mr Onipede referred me, to the appellant submitting
    her witness statement (at page 26 of the bundle) was on the occasion of
    her asylum interview which had taken place on 31 October 2019 after the
    Screening  Interview.   He  pointed  out  that  at  para  6.2  of   the
    appellant's Screening Interview (page 17 of the bundle)  the  appellant
    when asked whether she had documents said "I will bring to  the  asylum
    interview".   Although  apparently   written   before   the   Screening
    Interview, Mr Howells submitted the  witness  statement  had  not  been
    provided to the Home Office and the judge had,  therefore,  not  fallen
    into error in taking into account that the appellant had not raised the
    issue of police  harassment  prior  to  the  Screening  Interview.   In
    addition, Mr Howells submitted that the judge had  given  a  number  of
    reasons for not accepting the appellant's  credibility  and  any  error
    would not be material.

21. In response, Mr Onipede submitted, on instructions,  that  the  witness
    statement had been provided at the time of the Screening Interview.  He
    relied on the fact that it was dated before the Screening Interview  on
    21 October 2019 and it appeared in the respondent's bundle,  apparently
    in chronological order, prior to the Screening Interview.   As  regards
    materiality, Mr Onipede submitted that the judge had, himself, referred
    to her claim to have been harassed by the  police  as  something  which
    "formed a major part of her claim" and  was,  he  submitted,  therefore
    material to the judge's adverse credibility finding.

22. As regards para 85 of the judge's determination,  Mr  Howells  accepted
    the evidence of Mr Akoheni particularly given that it was supported  by
    a tenancy agreement (at pages 20-25 of the  bundle)  which  was  for  a
    single room as Mr Aminu had claimed in his evidence that he rented  for
    the appellant and also the implausibility point made by the judge  that
    the witness had said the appellant was being accommodated in  a  rented
    three-bedroom house as an  asylum  seeker.   Nevertheless,  Mr  Howells
    again submitted that this error was not material to the decision  given
    the judge's multiple reasons for not accepting the credibility  of  the
    appellant.

23. Mr Onipede submitted that this (now accepted) error was  also  material
    to the decision and he invited me to set the decision aside.

Discussion

24. I deal first with para 81 of the determination.

25. There is no doubt that there is in existence a witness statement  dated
    1 October 2019 - and therefore dated before the  appellant's  Screening
    Interview - which, if taken at  face  value,  contradicts  the  judge's
    premise in para 81 that the appellant's credibility on "a major part of
    her claim" is undermined by the fact that she had not  mentioned  being
    harassed by the police prior to her Screening Interview.  There  is  no
    clear evidence as to when this  document  was  submitted  to  the  Home
    Office.  The Screening  Interview,  itself,  refers  to  the  appellant
    wishing to provide  documents  at  her  "asylum  interview"  which,  of
    course, was later.  Likewise, at that interview it is recorded (at page
    26) that the appellant wished to submit three documents one of which is
    a "witness statement".  Mr Onipede relied on that  latter  document  as
    supporting his submissions but, as became plain following  Mr  Howells'
    submissions, it does not provide that support because it  concerns  the
    submission of a witness statement at the  asylum  interview  which,  of
    course, was later than the Screening Interview.  There is no suggestion
    that the appellant has submitted more than  one  witness  statement  in
    support of her asylum claim.  Mr Onipede told me, on instructions, that
    the witness statement had been submitted for the  Screening  Interview.
    Further, Mr Akoheni's statement dated 2 October 2020 also  states  that
    he:

         "received clear instruction from the  appellant  that  the  witness
         statement dated 01 October 2019 was presented  to  the  Immigration
         Officer prior to the screening interview on the 21 October 2019."

26. It is also the case, for what it is worth, that the appellant's witness
    statement appears in an apparently chronological bundle produced by the
    Home Office prior  to  the  Screening  Interview  and  not  the  asylum
    interview.

27. As I have said, the evidence is somewhat ambiguous and equivocal.   The
    judge, however, seems to have treated it  as  a  given  fact  that  the
    appellant's witness statement  dated  1  October  2019,  which  was  in
    evidence before him, was not made available to the Home  Office  before
    the Screening Interview.  That was not self-evidently the case  on  the
    basis of the material that was before the judge.  The statement  itself
    predated the Screening Interview by twenty days and reflected the  date
    upon  which  the  appellant  had,  in  fact,  claimed  asylum.   In  an
    apparently chronological bundle produced by the Home Office it appeared
    before the Screening Interview rather than  after  it  and  before  the
    asylum  interview.   Of  course,  there  was   also   the   potentially
    conflicting material in para 6.2 of the Screening Interview and at page
    26 of the bundle which pointed to the witness statement being  produced
    at the time of the asylum interview.

28. Given the equivocal evidence and  material  before  the  judge,  it  is
    difficult to assess  whether  the  judge  made  an  actual  mistake  in
    concluding that the witness statement had not been  provided  prior  to
    the Screening Interview so as to provide evidence  of  the  appellant's
    claim to have been harassed by the police.  It does not appear to  have
    been an issue which was explored at the hearing.  It was not  suggested
    before me that the issue had arisen at the hearing although  it  was  a
    point raised in the decision letter at para 37 (referred to as part  of
    the respondent's case at para 50 of the determination).   Nevertheless,
    the judge does not grapple with  the  apparently  conflicting  evidence
    about when the witness statement was provided to the Home  Office.   He
    simply finds, as if uncontroversial, that it was not made available  at
    the time of the Screening Interview.  His failure to  engage  with  the
    evidence and to give reasons for preferring one understanding  of  that
    evidence over another was, in itself, an error of law.

29. Given the prominence of this point, as the judge made clear in para  81
    of his determination, and given  the  ambiguity  in  the  evidence  and
    material before the judge, prior to reaching a firm finding against the
    appellant it was, in my judgment, also  incumbent  upon  the  judge  to
    raise this issue so that the appellant had a fair opportunity  to  deal
    with the contention that  she  had  not  raised  the  issue  of  police
    harassment, in particular through her statement dated 1  October  2019,
    prior to the Screening Interview.  That also amounted to  an  error  of
    law.

30. As regards para 85 of the determination, Mr Howells  accepts  that  the
    judge made a mistake  of  fact,  amounting  to  an  error  of  law,  in
    misstating the evidence of Mr Aminu concerning  his  (and  his  wife's)
    arrangements for providing accommodation to the appellant  in  the  UK.
    That error was relevant  to  the  judge's  assessment  of  whether  the
    evidence of Mr Aminu, supportive in other respects of  the  appellant's
    claim was credible or reliable.

31. Whilst it cannot be gainsaid that the judge gave a  number  of  reasons
    for rejecting the evidence of the appellant  and  the  evidence  of  Mr
    Aminu, overall I accept the submissions of Mr Onipede that these errors
    were material to the judge's adverse credibility findings.

32. As regards para 81, any finding in relation to  whether  the  appellant
    had raised prior to the Screening Interview, what the  judge  describes
    as a "major part of  her  claim",  was  something  that  undermined  an
    important part of her  claim  that  she  had  been  discovered  with  a
    girlfriend and, as a result of that, both through her husband  and  her
    girlfriend's husband the police had harassed her and,  indeed,  treated
    her with  hostility.   If  that  latter  element  of  her  account  was
    disbelieved, it significantly undermined the veracity  overall  of  her
    claim to be bisexual and, as a result of what had  previously  occurred
    to her in Nigeria, to be at risk on return.

33. As regards the mistake in relation to Mr Aminu's evidence, it is  plain
    from paras  85  -  88,  that  the  judge  did  take  into  account  his
    misunderstanding of Mr Aminu's evidence  in  reaching  his  conclusion,
    albeit "overall", that he did not find the witness to  be  credible  or
    reliable.  I accept that the judge gave a number of  other  reasons  in
    paras 85 - 87 for reaching that overall conclusion.  However, I am  not
    persuaded that the  judge  would  necessarily  have  reached  the  same
    conclusion in relation to Mr Aminu's credibility had he not fallen into
    this error.

34. In any event, the error  disclosed  in  relation  to  para  81  of  the
    determination  relates  to  a  significant  building   block   in   the
    appellant's asylum claim that, in itself, materially contributed to the
    judge's adverse credibility finding which, for that reason,  cannot  be
    sustained.



Decision

35. For these reasons, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  to  dismiss
    the appellant's appeal involved the making of an error  of  law.   That
    decision cannot stand and is set aside.

36. In the light of the nature and extent  of  fact-finding  required,  and
    having regard to para 7.2 of the Senior President's Practice Statement,
    and as was  agreed  between  the  representatives  if  I  accepted  the
    appellant's submissions, the proper disposal of this appeal is to remit
    it to the First-tier Tribunal for a de novo re-hearing.   None  of  the
    factual findings made by Judge Blake are preserved.

37. The appeal is, therefore, remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a  de
    novo re-hearing before a judge other than Judge A J Blake.
