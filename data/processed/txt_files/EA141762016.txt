Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Layne, Counsel instructed by Andy D Legal and
                    Immigration Associates
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

         Background

      1. By a decision promulgated on 27 July 2018, I found an error of  law
         in the decision of First-Tier Tribunal Judge Coutts promulgated  on
         3  April  2018  dismissing  the  Appellant's  appeal  against   the
         Secretary of State's decision dated 2 December 2016 refusing him  a
         permanent right of residence based on his retained  rights  as  the
         former spouse of an EEA (French) national, Ms  [SK].  I  set  aside
         Judge Coutts' decision and gave directions for the re-making of the
         decision. My error of law decision is annexed to this decision  for
         ease of reference.

      2. The background facts are adequately set out at [2] and  [3]  of  my
         error of law decision and I do not repeat them.  I also have regard
         to the evidence set out at [18] and [19] of  my  earlier  decision.
         The Judge's misunderstanding as to what that evidence shows is  the
         basis on which I found an error of law.

         Submissions

      3. I received written  submissions  from  the  Respondent  immediately
         before the hearing.  Having regard  to  my  earlier  decision,  the
         Respondent  no  longer  takes  issue  with  whether  Ms  [SK]  (the
         Appellant's ex-wife) was exercising Treaty rights as at the date of
         divorce on 30 March 2016 (see in particular the evidence  cited  in
         second bullet point at [18] of my earlier decision).  That evidence
         also shows a reasonably complete picture of employment for Ms  [SK]
         between June 2010 (when the Appellant  applied  for  the  residence
         permit which was later granted) and the date of divorce, over  five
         years later.

      4. The only point on which the Respondent takes issue in  his  written
         submissions is whether there is evidence  that  the  Appellant  has
         himself been exercising Treaty rights as if he were an EU  national
         at all relevant times.  As Mr Melvin pointed out  at  the  hearing,
         the Respondent's consideration of this issue was  confined  to  the
         documents which the Respondent had before him when the  application
         leading to the decision under appeal was made.  The Respondent  was
         not represented at the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal  and
         did not therefore have the Appellant's bundle.

      5. I therefore  passed  to  Mr  Melvin  the  Tribunal's  copy  of  the
         Appellant's bundle and gave him time to consider the documents  put
         forward in  support  of  the  Appellant's  employment.   Mr  Melvin
         accepted that the documents showed that the Appellant was  employed
         in the period October 2011 to 2016.  Accordingly, he accepted  that
         the Appellant meets all the requirements for permanent residence on
         the basis of a retained right  of  residence  as  at  the  date  of
         hearing (and as at the date  of  the  Respondent's  decision  under
         appeal).

         Decision and reasons

      6. In light of the Respondent's concession  which  I  consider  to  be
         rightly made and in light of the evidence as set out in my  earlier
         decision (in relation to Ms [SK]'s employment) and that accepted by
         the Respondent in relation to the Appellant's own  employment,  the
         Appellant is entitled to a permanent  right  of  residence  on  the
         basis of a retained right of residence following his  divorce  from
         his EEA national spouse.




    DECISION

    The Appellant's appeal is allowed under the EEA Regulations 2006

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Adama-Adams, Counsel instructed on a direct
                    access basis by the Appellant
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

         Background

      1. The Appellant appeals against a  decision  of  First-Tier  Tribunal
         Judge  Coutts  promulgated  on  3  April  2018   ("the   Decision")
         dismissing the Appellant's appeal against the Secretary of  State's
         decision dated 2 December 2016 refusing him a  permanent  right  of
         residence based on his retained rights as the former spouse  of  an
         EEA (French) national, Ms [SK].   The Respondent's decision is made
         under The Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006
         ("the 2006 Regulations").

      2. The Appellant is a  national  of  Ghana.   On  14  June  2010,  the
         Appellant applied for a residence card as the  spouse  of  Ms  [SK]
         which was granted valid until 3 November  2015.   The  couple  were
         divorced on 30 March 2016.  The  Appellant  applied  for  permanent
         residence on 26 May 2016.  That was refused by the  decision  under
         appeal.

      3. The Respondent accepted that the marriage had lasted for  at  least
         three years prior  to  divorce  and  that  the  parties  had  lived
         together in the UK for at least one year.  However, the  Respondent
         was not satisfied that Ms [SK] had been exercising Treaty rights at
         the date of the divorce or that they had both  been  residing  here
         under the 2006 Regulations for five years before  that  date.   The
         Respondent was also not  satisfied  that  the  Appellant  had  been
         residing in the UK as if he were an EEA national since his divorce.

      4. The Respondent was not represented at the hearing before the First-
         tier Tribunal.  The Judge found at [18] of  the  Decision  that  Ms
         [SK] was exercising Treaty rights at the time of divorce.  However,
         the Judge did not accept that she had been exercising Treaty rights
         for a period of five years prior to the divorce.  The Judge did not
         therefore go on to determine whether the Appellant was residing  in
         accordance with the 2006 Regulations before or after his divorce.

      5. The Appellant's grounds of appeal turn  on  the  interpretation  of
         Regulations 10 and 15 of the 2006 Regulations.  He  says  that  the
         Judge was wrong to require proof that Ms [SK] had  been  exercising
         Treaty rights throughout a continuous five years' period.  He  says
         that he is required to show only that he has been exercising Treaty
         rights throughout  that  period.   He  relies  in  that  regard  on
         Regulation 15(1)(b) of the 2006 Regulations.

      6. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge P J M
         Hollingworth on 2 June 2018 in the following terms:

             "[1]      The application for permission was out of  time.   I
             extend time  in  the  light  of  the  factors.   I  grant  the
             application.   The  Respondent  was  not  represented  at  the
             hearing before the Judge.   Given  the  Judge's  findings  and
             reasons it is arguable that the  presence  of  the  Respondent
             would have enabled enquiry to have been made with HMRC  as  to
             whether any further evidence was available in relation to  the
             exercise of treaty rights by the Sponsor.  It is arguable that
             the absence of a representative for  the  Respondent  deprived
             the Judge of the opportunity for making such enquiry  and  has
             potentially led to unfairness or unfairness which can be  seen
             to have arisen in the circumstances.  In the alternative it is
             arguable  that  the  interpretation  of  the  Regulations  set
             forward in the permission  application  has  not  attracted  a
             sufficient analysis from the Judge."

      7. The matter comes before me to decide whether the Decision  contains
         a material error of law.

         Decision and Reasons

      8. Since the last sentence of the  permission  grant  does  apparently
         find arguable the grounds of appeal which were actually put forward
         by the Appellant, I will begin with those grounds even if they were
         not pursued with any vigour (or indeed at all) by Mr Adama-Adams.

      9. The Appellant was right to abandon reliance on the pleaded  grounds
         for the following reasons.

     10. The application which the Appellant made was for a permanent  right
         of residence.  As the Respondent's decision makes clear, therefore,
         Regulation 10(5) and (6) has to be read  with  Regulation  15(1)(f)
         which provides that a non-EEA national family member will only have
         the right to reside permanently in the UK  provided  that  he  "has
         resided in the United Kingdom in accordance with these  Regulations
         for a continuous period  of  five  years".   In  other  words,  the
         Appellant must show that he has been the family member  of  an  EEA
         national exercising Treaty rights (or on some other basis under the
         Regulations) for a period of five years as well as showing, as  the
         Appellant has done, that the marriage has lasted for at least three
         years and that the parties lived together in the UK  for  at  least
         one of those years.

     11. I turn then to the main basis on which permission was granted which
         is on a ground which is not pleaded by the Appellant.   In essence,
         the basis of the grant is that,  because  the  Respondent  was  not
         represented at the hearing before Judge Coutts, the Appellant  lost
         the opportunity to plug gaps in the evidence he had about Ms [SK]'s
         employment, as a result  of  which  the  Appellant  was  unable  to
         satisfy the requirements of the 2006 Regulations.

     12. There are a number of reasons why I am not satisfied that there  is
         any error in this regard.

     13. First, the Appellant did not himself complain of any unfairness  in
         this regard.  I recognise that a Judge can be expected to  identify
         any procedural unfairness for himself.  However, the Appellant  was
         represented by Counsel who could be  expected  to  raise  any  such
         issue on his behalf. It cannot  be  said  that  the  procedure  was
         obviously unfair in circumstances where the Appellant  had  managed
         to produce some documentation about Ms [SK]'s employment.

     14. Second and more importantly, if the  Appellant  wished  to  seek  a
         direction that the Respondent obtain information as  to  Ms  [SK]'s
         working history, he did not need to wait for the hearing  in  order
         to do so.  Neither would the  absence  of  the  Respondent  at  the
         hearing before Judge Coutts have prevented an  application  on  his
         behalf for  an  adjournment  and  request  for  such  a  direction.
         However, as Mr Tufan pointed out, no such application has been made
         or even intimated until Judge Hollingworth  granted  permission  in
         the way that he  did  (and  in  fact  no  such  application  for  a
         direction is made even now).

     15.  Third,  the  Appellant  was  able  to  supply  quite  a   lot   of
         documentation about Ms [SK]'s working history.  Generally, in  such
         cases, the former spouse will have access  to  documents  from  the
         time when the marriage was subsisting but will be  in  difficulties
         obtaining evidence from the period after the  marriage  has  broken
         down.   Here,  the  Appellant   was   clearly   able   to   provide
         documentation for the latter period and for most of the five years'
         period but could not provide documents for a  period  in  2011  and
         2012.

     16. That then leads  me  on  to  the  basis  of  Mr  Adama-Adams'  oral
         submissions to me which focussed  rather  less  on  any  unfairness
         arising from the Respondent's absence and the Appellant's inability
         to obtain the necessary documents and more on what he  said  was  a
         failure by the Judge to exercise flexibility  in  relation  to  the
         documents which were produced.  That was perhaps in recognition  of
         the factual difficulty, as identified above, that the Appellant had
         not actually taken any steps to ask the Respondent to  provide  the
         documents  at  any  stage  (including  after  Judge  Hollingworth's
         permission grant).

     17. The focus of Mr Adama-Adams' submissions is [27]  to  [34]  of  the
         Decision which reads as follows:

             "[27]      Unfortunately,  the  evidence   produced   by   the
             appellant in respect of the sponsor's employment situation  is
             incomplete.  The appellant accepts the same but  asks  that  I
             take an overview or holistic  approach  to  assessing  matters
             because this is all the information that he can provide; he is
             no longer in contact with the sponsor and does  not  know  her
             whereabouts.

             [28]      For tax year 2015, I am prepared  to  take  such  an
             approach because, in addition to some payslips, there is a P60
             produced for the sponsor showing her end of year earnings  for
             that tax year.

             [29]      I am also prepared to do so for tax years  2013  and
             2014, notwithstanding that there  are  no  payslips  produced,
             because these are also supported by P60s showing end  of  year
             earnings for the sponsor which  are  broadly  consistent  with
             each other and the later tax year of 2015.

             [30]      There is no P60 produced for tax year 2016 which  is
             not surprising as this would not have been  available  at  the
             time of the appellant's divorce from the sponsor  and  I  have
             already indicated above that I accept that treaty rights  were
             being exercised at the time of the divorce on 30 March 2016.

             [31]      This leaves tax year 2012 and the first three months
             of 2011.

             [32]      I find that I am unable to be as  flexible  here  in
             approach as I  have  been  with  the  other  tax  years.   The
             payslips produced do not show a complete period as  there  are
             only seven months for 2012 and the month of January is missing
             in 2011; moreover, there are no P60s produced  for  these  tax
             years.

             [33]      I therefore cannot be satisfied that the sponsor was
             employed  continuously  during  these  periods  and  therefore
             exercising treaty rights for the required five years prior  to
             her divorce from the appellant.

             [34]      If P60s had been provided for  these  tax  years  as
             well then it would have been open for me to conclude with  any
             level of earnings shown that employment  was  likely  to  have
             continued throughout the period; however,  this  was  not  the
             case."

     18. I agreed that, in considering the Appellant's submission,  I  would
         need to assess for myself the evidence which the Judge  had  before
         him in relation to Ms [SK]'s exercise of Treaty rights.  That is as
         follows:

                . Payslips from NBS Guarding (UK) Ltd for the months of June
                  2010 to March 2012  inclusive  except  those  for  August,
                  September and December 2010 and January,  June  to  August
                  and November 2011. Those payslips showing  monthly  income
                  of roughly �320 per month;

                . Payslips from Hashmat Property  Maintenance  Ltd  for  the
                  months from April 2015 to  March  2016  inclusive  showing
                  income of roughly �425 per month rising  to  roughly  �620
                  per month from September 2015;

                . P60 for  year  ending  5  April  2013  showing  income  of
                  �3930.46

                . P60 for  year  ending  5  April  2014  showing  income  of
                  �4557.16

                . P60 for  year  ending  5  April  2015  showing  income  of
                  �5039.20

     19. In considering the documents before the Judge,  it  is  immediately
         apparent to me that there is an error in what is said by the  Judge
         at [32] of the Decision.   In  fact,  the  Judge  appears  to  have
         confused at [22] of the Decision documents which relate to 2011 and
         not 2012.  As such, there was a relatively complete picture  of  Ms
         [SK]'s  employment  from  June  2010  to  March  2012  but  nothing
         thereafter until April 2015.  There are gaps of eight months within
         that period but documents either side of those gaps which show that
         Ms [SK] was working for the same employer on roughly the same wage.
          Thereafter, the gap in documentation is covered by the P60 for the
         year ending April 2013 which shows that she earnt �3930.46 which is
         consistent with the monthly wage which she was earning up to end of
         March 2012.

     20. Although neither party drew my attention to this error,  it  is  an
         obvious error of fact.  The next issue which arises is whether that
         error of fact is capable of amounting to an error of law.

     21. I have regard to the Court of  Appeal's  judgment  in  E  and  R  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] EWCA Civ 49 which
         deals with this issue.  At [66]  of  the  judgment,  the  Court  of
         Appeal set out its approach to the issue of  whether  an  error  of
         fact can amount to an error of law as follows:

             "In our view, the time has now come to accept that  a  mistake
             of fact giving rise  to  unfairness  is  a  separate  head  of
             challenge in an appeal on a point of law, at  least  in  those
             statutory contexts where the parties share an interest in  co-
             operating to  achieve  the  correct  result.   Asylum  law  is
             undoubtedly such an area.   Without  seeking  to  lay  down  a
             precise code, the  ordinary  requirements  for  a  finding  of
             unfairness are apparent  from  the  above  analysis  of  CICB.
             First, there must have been a mistake as to an existing  fact,
             including a mistake as to the availability of  evidence  on  a
             particular matter.  Secondly, the fact or evidence  must  have
             been "established", in the sense that it was uncontentious and
             objectively  verifiable.   Thirdly,  the  appellant  (or   his
             advisers) must not have  been  responsible  for  the  mistake.
             Fourthly,  the  mistake  must  have  played  a  material  (not
             necessarily decisive) part in the Tribunal's reasoning."

     22. Although E and R was an asylum case,  it  arose  from  a  statutory
         appeal before this Tribunal (or  its  predecessor)  and  I  see  no
         reason to distinguish it simply because the current  case  involves
         determination of the Appellant's status under EU law.  In terms  of
         the  factors  raised,  the  Judge  has  clearly  misunderstood  the
         documentation relating to Ms [SK]'s employment.  That evidence  was
         in fact before the Judge and as such the error of law is not simply
         one predicated on the error of fact but is also a failure  to  take
         into account material evidence by reason of the misunderstanding of
         what  that  evidence  shows.   The   evidence   which   the   Judge
         misunderstood and his finding on that evidence is clearly  material
         to the legal issue which he had to  decide.   Indeed,  the  Judge's
         mistake was the sole reason for him dismissing the appeal (although
         it is fair to note that he did not go on to  consider  whether  the
         Appellant had also shown that he was exercising Treaty rights as if
         he were an EEA national during the relevant period).   Accordingly,
         the mistake has given rise to unfairness which amounts to an  error
         of law.  As I have also noted, separately, it also gives rise to  a
         failure properly to consider material evidence which is  itself  an
         error of law.

     23. For that reason alone, I find that there is an error of law.   That
         error is capable of being material since the evidence may  well  be
         sufficient to show that Ms [SK] was working for the  relevant  five
         years'  period.   However,  since  the  above   analysis   of   the
         documentation and the error committed by the Judge was not  brought
         to my attention by either party in the course of the hearing before
         me, I do not re-make the decision on that basis.  In any  event,  I
         cannot do so without hearing from the parties in  relation  to  the
         final issue of whether the documents show that  the  Appellant  has
         himself been exercising Treaty rights throughout the period.   That
         was also put at issue in the Respondent's decision.

     24. For that reason, I  have  given  directions  below  for  a  resumed
         hearing to re-make the decision.

    DECISION

    I am satisfied that the Decision contains a material error  of  law.  I
    therefore set aside the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Coutts
    promulgated on 3  April  2018.  I  give  the  following  directions  in
    relation to the re-making of the decision




    DIRECTIONS

    This appeal is to be relisted for an oral hearing in order  to  re-make
    the decision on the first available date after 28 days  from  the  date
    when this decision is sent.  Time estimate � day.
