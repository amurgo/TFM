Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Bahja, Counsel instructed by Duncan Lewis & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms K Pal, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant is a citizen of India. His date of birth  is  3  December
    1981.  He made an application for leave to remain which was refused  on
    27 October 2015. He appealed against that decision and his  appeal  was
    dismissed  under  Article  8,  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Nicholls, following a hearing  on  9  December  2016.   Permission  was
    granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Osborne on 24 July 2017.

2.       The Appellant came to the UK as a visitor in 2006. He has  been  an
    overstayer since the expiry of his leave  in  2007.   The  judge  heard
    evidence from the Appellant, his wife and his mother-in-law.

3.   The Appellant gave evidence in English at the  hearing.  The  Appellant
    and his wife were married in a Hindu ceremony on 19 August 2016.   They
    have lived together since 2011.  The Appellant's family do not  approve
    of his marriage to his wife and their  relationship  generally  because
    she is a divorc�e. They could not live  together  in  India.  His  wife
    would not be welcomed by his family.

 4.      Ms Sheth, the Appellant's wife, was born in the UK in 1985  and  is
    a British citizen. Her evidence was that she is employed  by  Santander
    Bank and she also studies.  In relation to  her  employment  she  is  a
    senior member of a team dealing with high  net  worth  clients  looking
    after investment portfolios and dealing with the client's requirements.
    Her evidence was that she earns  enough  to  support  herself  and  the
    Appellant.  At the hearing before me it was confirmed that the evidence
    before the judge was that she was  earned  in  excess  of  �30,000  per
    annum.  She is the only child of parents  here  and  they  have  health
    problems and she helps them.  She would not be able to  live  in  India
    because it is not generally accepted in India for  people  to  divorce,
    she has always been taken ill when travelling to India previously,  she
    has never met any of the Appellant's family and that she believes  that
    the human rights position as regards women in India is such that it was
    unreasonable to expect her to live there.

5.   The Appellant's mother-in-law, Mrs  Shakuntala  Sheth,  gave  evidence.
    Her evidence was that she and her husband were born in  Tanzania.   Mrs
    Sheth is employed as a cashier at Sainsbury's.   Her  daughter  is  her
    only child. Mrs Sheth  suffers  from  rheumatoid  arthritis  and  other
    health problems. She and her husband  rely  on  her  daughter  and  the
    Appellant for a considerable amount of day-to-day assistance.

6.   The judge's findings are found at paras 16 to 23.  The judge,  at  para
    17, stated that the Appellant's representative did not  seek  to  argue
    insurmountable obstacles or very significant obstacles in  the  context
    of the Immigration Rules. The judge found, at paragraph  18,  that  the
    Appellant cannot meet the terms of the Immigration Rules, but  went  on
    to consider proportionality. The  judge  recorded  that  the  Appellant
    relied on the fact that he had entered the UK lawfully  and  married  a
    British citizen and that she was well-paid in a responsible  job  here.
    The judge concluded that there was no "independent confirmation" of the
    Appellant's family having rejected him. In any event, he concluded that
    the original home area of the Appellant and his family is Haryana  this
    is only a small part of the large Indian sub-continent. He  noted  that
    the Appellant's evidence was that he had lived independently  in  Delhi
    and he found that the Appellant had not given any reason why  he  could
    not return there and find work.  The judge found at para 20, in respect
    of the human rights position,  that there was no evidence to show  that
    there would be such a level of discrimination  and  disapproval  as  to
    amount to a "sufficiently serious interference  with  article  8".   In
    respect of the wife's parents' medical needs the judge concluded:-

     "The evidence is, however, that  the  parents  both  manage  to  retain
         employment and to  live  independently.   Mrs  Sheth  attended  the
         hearing and although she was assisted by walking stick  (sic),  she
         was clearly able  to  move  around  and  she  was  obviously  fully
         mentally capable.  There is no indication that there has  been  any
         form of professional independent assessment which shows  that  they
         are in need of special care provision.  Whilst  the  assistance  of
         their daughter is, undoubtedly, valuable, I am not  satisfied  that
         the evidence  in  this  appeal  demonstrates  factors  which  could
         properly be described as  exceptional  or  particularly  compelling
         which would serve to outweigh the substantial weight which must  be
         given to immigration control".

7.    The  judge  attached  little  weight  to  the  relationship  that  the
    Appellant had  formed  with  his  wife,  taking  into  account  section
    117B(4) of the 2002 Act.  The  judge  went  on  to  conclude  that  the
    interference would be justified and proportionate.  In respect  of  any
    potential application for entry clearance the judge concluded  at  para
    23 :-

     "It is wrong for me to speculate about the outcome  of  an  application
         for entry clearance for settlement.  That will be a matter  for  an
         entry  clearance  officer  on  the  basis  of  the   evidence   and
         documentation submitted with the application"



8.   The grounds before Judge Osborne are  twofold.   It  is  asserted  that
    there was no assessment  under  the  Immigration  Rules  with  specific
    reference to EX.1. which was raised in the skeleton argument before the
    First-tier Tribunal and the judge erred in not making an assessment  of
    insurmountable obstacles.  In respect of this ground I accept that  the
    judge should have considered insurmountable obstacles, but did  not  do
    so. He misunderstood how the Appellant's case was to be advanced in the
    skeleton argument that was before him.  However, the issue  is  whether
    or not this is material to the outcome, which I will go on to  consider
    in due course.   The  second  ground  relates  to  the  proportionality
    assessment generally and it is asserted in the grounds that  the  judge
    failed to make findings in respect of  four  matters;  the  Appellant's
    estrangement from his  family;  whether  the  Appellant's  wife  has  a
    genuine well-founded fear of her human rights being breached in  India;
    whether the Appellant took steps to renew his  passport  and  if  there
    were any difficulties for him doing so and whether  the  Appellant  has
    been reporting, as he asserted, since 2009.  It is also asserted in the
    grounds that there were no  credibility  findings  in  respect  of  the
    evidence Appellant's wife and mother-in-law.  Mr Bahja expanded on this
    ground in his oral submissions to  me.   He  asserted  that  the  judge
    failed to consider that the  Appellant  and  his  wife  were  different
    nationalities  and  that  she  originates  from  Tanzania,   that   the
    Appellant's spouse is an only child and that her  father  is  disabled.
    He also relied on the unreported case  of  Iman  (IA/20153/2013).   The
    point as I understood it to be is that the judge failed to  factor  the
    issues mentioned into the proportionality exercise.

9.   At the hearing before me Mr Bahja made  an  application  to  amend  the
    grounds to add a further ground that the judge failed to  consider  the
    Chikwamba point (Chikwamba v Secretary of State for the Home Department
    [2008] UKHL 40), although  he  accepted  that  this  was  not  directly
    advanced before the First-tier  Tribunal.  Ms  Pal's  response  to  the
    application was that she was able to engage  with  the  issue.  It  was
    engaged with by the Respondent in the Rule 24 response (at para 7)  and
    this was relied on in submissions by Ms Pal; namely that there  was  no
    error of law because first; it was not an issue that  had  been  raised
    before the First-tier Tribunal Judge  and;  secondly,  because  of  the
    public interest argument.  I could see no prejudice to  the  Respondent
    in allowing the application  to  amend  the  grounds  and  allowed  the
    Appellant to pursue the ground on the Chikwamba point.


10.      The  Supreme Court in Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11, stated:-

         "51. Whether the applicant is in the UK unlawfully, or is  entitled
             to  remain  in  the  UK   only   temporarily,   however,   the
             significance of this consideration depends on what the outcome
             of immigration control might otherwise be. For example, if  an
             applicant would  otherwise  be  automatically  deported  as  a
             foreign criminal, then the weight of the  public  interest  in
             his or her removal will generally be very considerable. If, on
             the other hand, an applicant - even  if  residing  in  the  UK
             unlawfully - was otherwise certain  to  be  granted  leave  to
             enter, at least if an application were made from  outside  the
             UK, then there might be no  public  interest  in  his  or  her
             removal. The point is illustrated by the decision in Chikwamba
             v Secretary of State for the Home Department."

11.  In respect of grounds 1 and 2, it is unarguable that the judge did  not
    consider the Appellant's evidence of estrangement from his  family  and
    the evidence generally in respect of the Appellant's  wife's  fears  in
    having to live in India (see paras 20 and 21).  Whilst the judge stated
    that there was no "independent confirmation" of the  rejection  by  the
    Appellant's family of the Appellant and his wife  (see  para  19),  the
    judge went on to conclude that the Appellant on his own evidence  lived
    independently in Delhi and that  the  couple  could  live  anywhere  in
    India, and there is no challenge to this  finding.  The  judge,  in  my
    view, properly engaged with the  evidence  in  terms  of  human  rights
    abuses in India.  He concluded that there was no evidence to show  such
    a level of discrimination, as asserted by the Appellant, and  there  is
    no challenge of  substance  to  this  finding  of  the  judge.   It  is
    unarguable that the judge did not engage with the evidence in  relation
    to the wife's parents and their health concerns  (see  para  21).   The
    judge did not find the witnesses lacking in credibility, but  concluded
    that the evidence relating to the health of the Appellant's  parents-in-
    law was not  sufficient  to  establish  that  their  respective  health
    conditions were such to amount to compelling circumstances.  The  judge
    was mindful that the Appellant's partner was a British citizen and  did
    not have ties are connections with India.  There is  no  indication  by
    the judge whether he  accepted  the  Appellant's  evidence  or  not  in
    relation to renewal of his passport,  but  this  was  not  material  to
    insurmountable obstacles or Article 8 generally. The Respondent's  case
    was not that the Appellant had failed to report  and  this  was  not  a
    material consideration.

 12. The judge made extensive and adequate findings which  are  grounded  in
    the evidence in respect of the substantive Article 8 assessment.  There
    was no evidence before the judge which could have justified  a  finding
    of insurmountable obstacles. The unrepresented case relied  on  by  the
    Appellant does  not  assist  his  case.   The  judge  was  entitled  to
    conclude, on the evidence before him, that  there  were  no  compelling
    circumstances. Having regard to the judgment  in  Agyarko,  I  conclude
    that the error in failing to make a  discrete  finding  in  respect  of
    insurmountable obstacles was not material to the outcome in this case.

13.  I have gone on to consider the third ground of appeal relating  to  the
    Chikwamba point.  Ms Pal accepted that  the  Appellant's  wife  was  in
    employment and that he met the requirements of the Rules  and  that  an
    application for entry clearance would be granted, but  maintained  that
    there is no error of law because the case  was  not  advanced  on  this
    basis and because of the public  interest  argument.  Ms  Pal  did  not
    expand on the public interest argument.  In my  view  the  judge  erred
    because he should have gone on to consider proportionality in the light
    of Chikwamba. He  touched on it  at  para  23,  but  his  reference  to
    speculation was misconceived because the evidence before him  was  that
    the Appellant would meet the maintenance  requirements  of  the  Rules.
    The Supreme Court decision of Agyarko post-dates the  decision  of  the
    FtT, but it resurrects the Chikwamba  argument.  The  judge  materially
    erred for the above reasons and I set aside the decision. I went on  to
    remake the decision.

14.    I have  taken  into  account  section  117B  of  the  2002  Act.  The
    Appellant is an overstayer and the maintenance of immigration is in the
    public interest. Little weight should be  accorded  to  a  relationship
    with a qualified  partner  established  when  the  Appellant  was  here
    unlawfully.  However, the weight to be attached to the public  interest
    is not fixed and is reduced,  in  this  case,  by  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant would meet  the  requirements  for  entry  clearance.   I  am
    persuaded that the Appellant has  shown  compelling  circumstances  and
    that the decision is  not  proportionate  to  the  public  interest  in
    removal.  I remake the decision and allow the appeal under  Article  8.



Notice of Decision

15.  For the above reasons  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    dismiss the appeal under Article 8 is set aside and I go  on  to  allow
    the appeal under Article 8.


15.  No anonymity direction is made.
