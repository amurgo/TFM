                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who was born  on  13  June  1972.
    She appeals against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Zahed promulgated on 5 December 2016  following  a  hearing  at  Hatton
    Cross on 14 September 2016.  I am satisfied  that  notwithstanding  the
    fact that somewhat less than three months passed  between  the  hearing
    and the promulgation of this determination the appellant  has  suffered
    no prejudice.  It was a matter which was  dealt  with  largely  on  the
    basis of material  that  was  placed  before  him  and  there  were  no
    credibility findings or issues on credibility  which  might  have  been
    tainted by the fact that there was a delay between the hearing and  the
    promulgation of the determination.

 2. The appeal to the  Tribunal  was  against  the  decision  made  by  the
    respondent on 21 May 2015 refusing to vary her leave on the basis of an
    application which had previously been made using what is called FLR(O),
    that is, on the basis of a family and private life outside the Rules.

 3. The immigration history of this appellant is as follows.   She  entered
    the United Kingdom on 5 April 2006 with leave granted as a visitor from
    28 February 2006 until 28 August 2006 and  during  the  period  of  her
    extant leave she returned to Nigeria.  Whilst she was  in  Nigeria  she
    was issued with a multi-entry visit visa.  She did so in the name which
    we know her as, namely Mrs Hope Ukpene.  It was valid from 9  May  2007
    until 9 May 2009.

 4. She then re-entered the United Kingdom and remained during a period  in
    which she was convicted and sentenced to  twelve  months'  imprisonment
    for possessing false  or  improperly  obtained  or  another's  identity
    documents.  As a result of that she made a voluntary removal to Nigeria
    on 21 August 2007.  However, the conviction and  the  voluntary  return
    were all done under a different name; that is under  the  name  of  Mrs
    Hope Odoemena.

 5. The appellant then re-entered the United Kingdom  on  8  December  2007
    using the multi-entry visa  which  had  been  issued  on  9  May  2007.
    However, bearing in mind the removal which had been effected some  time
    before and the fact that she had been convicted of an offence  under  a
    different name, it is  clear  that  her  activities  on  re-entry  were
    unlawful in character because of the deception that had previously been
    used.  Once again using the  name  Odoemena,  she  was  subject  to  an
    exclusion order dated 4 November 2008.  That  is  consistent  with  her
    voluntary removal on 21  August  2007.   Such  an  exclusion  order  is
    approved by the Secretary of State and it appears to have been  put  in
    place because the decision maker in relation to  that  exclusion  order
    did not know of her entry into the United  Kingdom  under  a  different
    name.  It was likely that the order was put in place on the  assumption
    that the appellant  was  still  in  Nigeria,  having  been  voluntarily
    removed in 2007.

 6. The immigration history continues with an application that was made  on
    9 October 2008 for leave to remain as the spouse of a  settled  person.
    Unfortunately that was refused because the appellant had provided false
    documents in the form of bills in  support  of  her  application.   The
    refusal was therefore made on that basis.  Consequently, up until  2008
    there had been a number of instances where the appellant  had  breached
    immigration law.  In doing so she had  accumulated  what  can  only  be
    described as a poor immigration record.   Clearly  her  conviction  and
    sentence of imprisonment counted against her; so, too, her  application
    for entry clearance or entry into the United Kingdom on  the  basis  of
    using two different names; and also the application that was made on  9
    October 2008 which had been supported by false documents.  In  addition
    her immigration history was marred  by  the  fact  that  there  was  an
    exclusion order, albeit in a different name from the name I am  dealing
    with, which had been approved and which in essence reflected  the  fact
    that she had no right to be in the United Kingdom.

 7. The decision maker then went on to deal with the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules  and  concluded  by  reference  to  Appendix  FM  and
    paragraph 276ADE that the appellant did not meet the  requirements  for
    entry clearance or for further leave  to  remain  and  accordingly  the
    application was refused  under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  was  then
    considered under Article 8 by reference  to  exceptional  circumstances
    and the circumstances were not said to be exceptional.

 8. Running through the application there are two matters which require  my
    separate consideration.  The first is that the application was made  on
    the basis of FLR(O) and the application which I have seen,  which  runs
    to 36 pages, made a reference at page 13 to the fact  that  she  was  a
    widow and that her husband's estate was the subject of litigation.  She
    said at page 13 of the application:

         "Bereaved partner.  Death certificate, marriage certificate.  I  am
         applying for an extension of stay in the UK as a  bereaved  partner
         of a British citizen.  I was legally married  to  my  late  husband
         till he died.  My husband left properties behind for me to stay and
         take care of in the United Kingdom.   I  have  my  notice  of  home
         rights on one of my husband's properties.  I entered  a  caveat  in
         probate court under Family Law Act over my late husband estate",

    and that is indeed exactly what happened.  There was a  caveat  entered
    in relation to her husband's estate.  She had met her husband  in  2007
    or 2008 and they had married in 2008.  He died in 2014.

 9. There was also a reference on page 29 of 36 in the application  to  the
    fact that she is a bereaved partner and she was married to her  husband
    until he died, that they married on 4 July 2008, he died on 15 February
    2014.  They had therefore been together as man and wife  for  something
    slightly under six years and in support of that part of her  claim  she
    produced letters about not only her husband's death  and  the  marriage
    but also evidence as to the fact that they were living together when he
    died.  The caveat was also produced.

10. It was on this basis that the Secretary  of  State  came  to  make  the
    decision under the  private  life  outside  the  Rules.   The  decision
    letter, which is featured in  the  bundle,  went  through  the  various
    elements to the Rules and it looked at  the  decision  in  relation  to
    claim that she was involved in litigation over the estate of  her  late
    husband under the general heading of  exceptional  circumstances.   The
    decision maker said:

         "In support of your claim you state that you wish to remain in  the
         United Kingdom as during the time you cared for your  late  husband
         you both had private life in this country.  You further state  that
         you  are  contesting  your  husband's  children's  application  for
         probate.  This has been  carefully  considered  as  an  independent
         adult who  is  not  dependent  on  family  members.   This  is  not
         considered to be a compelling  or  compassionate  reason  to  grant
         leave to remain.  Therefore it  is  not  accepted  that  there  are
         exceptional circumstances which would mean removal is inappropriate
         in your case."

11. The grounds of appeal pick up in somewhat limited form the point  about
    the probate proceedings, saying in paragraph 7:  "Appellant  has  civil
    proceeding pending before UK court and the matter is  disputed  by  the
    other parties and the SSHD failed to take into consideration."  That of
    course as a matter of fact is wrong because from  the  passage  that  I
    have already read out on the last page of the decision letter, which is
    page 5 of 8, the Secretary of State had indeed given  consideration  to
    the claim.  Nevertheless it is a point which I am required to  consider
    now.  Under paragraph 8 of the grounds the appellant also alleges  that
    the Secretary of State had failed to  consider  the  application  under
    those parts of the Rules which deal with a bereaved spouse.  It  is  in
    this way that the matter comes before me.

12. The evidence that was adduced in relation to the probate  dispute  was,
    as I have said, very limited and it was treated by the  judge  in  that
    limited fashion.  The  determination  deals  with  the  fact  that  the
    applicant  had  a  poor  immigration  history  and  that  her   various
    applications had failed and that she was  not  able  to  succeed  under
    Appendix FM as she failed to meet the suitability  requirements  having
    been convicted of an offence for which she had  been  sentenced  to  at
    least twelve months' imprisonment  and  that  she  was  subject  to  an
    exclusion order.  Both of those matters are raised in  the  suitability
    requirements of the Rules.

13. The First-tier Tribunal Judge then recited the fact that the respondent
    could not succeed under paragraph 276ADE(1) as she was  then  43  years
    old, she had been in the United Kingdom only since  2007  and  although
    there would be initial hardship in her returning  to  Nigeria  she  had
    remained in Nigeria for many years of her life prior to her arrival  in
    the United Kingdom.

14. The First-tier Tribunal Judge went on to deal with the evidence and the
    submissions that had been made and recorded in  paragraph  8  that  the
    appellant wished to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  because  she  was
    contesting the wills that her husband purportedly made in 2012  and  in
    2013 which make no mention of her.  He  then  went  on  to  recite  the
    estate of her late husband, an estate valued in the region of �600,000,
    and that the two wills made in 2012 and 2013 respectively were  created
    in circumstances which rendered them  unenforceable.   That  is  itself
    supported by the copy of the particulars of claim in the  action  which
    has been commenced by the appellant against the defendants, who are the
    beneficiaries under the will of her late husband.  Those  beneficiaries
    are the deceased's seven children.  The allegations  contained  in  the
    particulars of claim make serious reading.

15. It appears that when the will was made on  27  August  2013  there  was
    evidence that he was suffering from advanced vascular dementia and  had
    had a deteriorating memory since 2009, that he was  completely  reliant
    on others for all his personal and medical needs, that he was unable to
    walk or get out of bed without assistance or to feed  himself  and  was
    unable  to  remember  his   medication   or   indeed   toilet   himself
    independently.  He had no control over his financial affairs and it  is
    said that he was disorientated and had difficulty in communicating.  He
    scored just 2 out of 30 on a mini mental state examination  on  29  May
    2013.  That was just a few  months  before  he  executed  the  will  in
    question and, at that same time, he was unable to  sign  the  sheet  to
    confirm his personal property upon admission to hospital.

16. It was on the basis of those circumstances that it was said that he did
    not have a capacity to enter into his will and that  he  did  not  have
    either knowledge or approval of its contents.  There is reference  made
    in the particulars of claim to a doctor who was treating  the  deceased
    who, on 30 December 2010, noted that the deceased suffered

      "...gradually  deteriorating  memory  last  eighteen  months.    Can't
         remember to take any meds or eat.  Sometimes talks to himself".

     There is also an allegation made that the  signature  of  the  deceased
    was not witnessed by the witnesses who purported to sign it and  indeed
    that the signature may not even have been that of the deceased.

17. Those proceedings were settled by Anna Metcalfe of Counsel and  clearly
    made out a substantial claim that the appellant was pursuing an  action
    in the United Kingdom courts in relation to the will.   However,  there
    are a number of features that are significant about that claim.   First
    that it was being pursued by  the  appellant  with  the  assistance  of
    solicitors and Counsel. Secondly that the matters  which  were  raised,
    namely matters such as capacity and consent to the content of the will,
    were all based upon the deceased's medical condition.

18. These are not matters of course upon which  the  appellant  herself  is
    able to give anything but  limited  information.   It  will  of  course
    depend on careful scrutiny of the medical notes and  the  circumstances
    in which these wills of 2012 and 2013 were executed.  They are  largely
    matters outside the personal knowledge of the  appellant.   Insofar  as
    she has knowledge, that knowledge is likely to be less weighty  in  its
    content than any medical evidence.

19. That was the basis upon which the claim was advanced before the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge.  What is, however, significant is  that,  although
    the appellant herself was making out  the  claim  that  she  could  not
    pursue this claim unless she was in the United Kingdom,  there  was  no
    material (as far as I am aware) from the  appellant's  advisers  before
    the First-tier Tribunal saying that her presence in the United  Kingdom
    was a necessity.

20. First of all, there could have been an opinion in the form  of  opinion
    evidence from  the  appellant's  Counsel,  Ms  Metcalfe,  or  from  her
    solicitors in that case, which I understand to be Irwin  Mitchell  LLP.
    They might have been able to deal expressly with the necessity  of  the
    appellant's presence.

21. Secondly, for the reasons that I have said, the need for the  appellant
    to remain in the United Kingdom during the course of the litigation was
    limited  in  that  there  was  no  reason  why  she  should  not   give
    instructions to her solicitors from out of country.

22. Finally, if it was necessary for her to enter the United Kingdom  at  a
    later stage then that entry might be facilitated by an application  for
    leave to enter as a  visitor  supported  by  her  legal  practitioners.
    Indeed, that might even be supported by  an  application  made  to  the
    judge for an indication that her presence in  the  United  Kingdom  was
    necessary for the furtherance of justice in the pursuit of this claim.

23. That was  therefore  the  situation  that  was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge and he dealt with that in his determination  in  what  I
    consider to be an appropriate way.  Although the determination is short
    he makes the salient point in paragraphs 9 and 12 that he had seen  the
    probate court documents.  He had considered  her  need  to  be  in  the
    United Kingdom in order to pursue her claim  and  her  statement  that,
    were she to be removed, she would not be able to pursue her claim.   He
    did not accept this.  He said:

         "I find she has solicitors that can pursue her claim and  that  she
         can apply for her evidence to be given by video link if need be.  I
         find that the appellant can give instructions and communicate  with
         her solicitors using modern means of communication."

24. In the  determination  the  judge  goes  on  to  say  that,  since  the
    challenges that are made to the wills of 2012 and 2013  relate  to  the
    mental capacity of  the  deceased  to  enter  into  a  valid  will,  he
    concluded that this would be provided by way of medical evidence as  to
    the deceased's mental state at the relevant time and he noted that  the
    deceased was receiving treatment  for  his  mental  impairment  at  the
    relevant time.  Those matters, the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  decided,
    could be pursued without the appellant being in the United Kingdom.

25. In my judgment that was a perfectly justifiable conclusion to reach  on
    the basis of the very limited material  that  was  before  him  and  in
    particular in the absence of any evidence  from  practitioners  to  say
    that her presence was required during the course of the preparation  of
    the hearing of this claim in court.

26. The appellant has provided to me, (which I have looked  at  out  of  an
    abundance of caution), a letter which was  not  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge but post-dates the promulgation of that determination on
    5 December 2016.  By way  of  a  letter  dated  19  December  2016  the
    appellant's solicitors wrote to her solicitors acting on behalf of  her
    immigration matters in these terms:

         "We confirm that our client may be  required  to  attend  court  in
         respect of her ongoing claim.  Legal proceedings were served on the
         defendants on 30 November 2016.  Should the court request a hearing
         for all parties to attend in person or if the matter proceeds to  a
         trial Mrs Ukpene will be  required  to  give  witness  evidence  in
         representation of her claim."

27. That falls well short of saying that her presence is  required  at  the
    moment in order to pursue this action.  There may be a case  where  the
    court requests a hearing for all the parties to attend in  person  and,
    were that to be the case, then her immigration status  would  doubtless
    be the subject of comment by her advisers. Were an order  or  direction
    to be made, attempts would naturally follow for her to attend  if  that
    was necessary.  If matters were to proceed to a trial then  that,  too,
    would be the subject of a separate  application.   However,  there  are
    numerous occasions nowadays where evidence from those living in another
    country is dealt with by way of either a telephone call or by  a  video
    link, which is  permissible,  albeit  within  the  constraints  of  the
    telecommunication system in operation at the relevant venue.  So, in my
    judgment, although the judge did not have  this  letter,  it  does  not
    significantly advance the appellant's claim to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom during the pendency of this litigation.

28. The second point that is made is in  relation  to  the  nature  of  her
    Article 8 claim.  That was dealt with by the First-tier Tribunal Judge.
     I can encapsulate the nature of the claim.  Paul Orji wrote  a  letter
    in support of the appellant's claim to remain in  the  United  Kingdom.
    He described how she has been known to the family for years in  Nigeria
    and had been living with her father as a fianc�e since 8 December  2007
    before they officially got married on 4 July  2008.   Since  that  time
    they had been living together happily as a family and he described  her
    as being of good character and a nice person.  He also went on  to  say
    that his father was 64 years  old  and  had  been  medically  ill  both
    physically and mentally and life had been difficult.  As  a  result  of
    that the appellant gave him much needed support in his daily life.

29. That was the nature of the Article 8 claim principally advanced by  the
    appellant and that was dealt with by the judge by reference to  s.  117
    of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act,  2002   and   the
    limitations upon granting leave to remain to those people whose private
    life (or indeed private and family life) was established at a time when
    they had a precarious immigration status.  He concluded that since  the
    death of her husband she had no appreciable family life in  the  UK  as
    her only family member was her husband and that her husband's children,
    as defendants to the  action  that  she  was  bringing,  could  not  be
    considered  to  be  family  members  to  whom  there  was   a   special
    relationship that might require her continued presence.

30. He recorded the simple fact that the appellant had been  unlawfully  in
    the United  Kingdom  since  being  convicted  and  was  subject  to  an
    exclusion order.  He recorded the fact that she had  lived  in  Nigeria
    for some 35 years.  Although she had been in  the  United  Kingdom  for
    nine years,  those  were  nine  years  of  unlawful  presence  and  the
    relationship that developed with her late husband was  whilst  she  was
    here unlawfully and her immigration status was precarious.

31. He found that the  appellant  could  pursue  her  claim  from  Nigeria,
    communicating with her sisters using email and telephone  and  that  it
    was proportionate to remove her.  Those findings were properly open  to
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  He was entitled to treat the  claim  as
    being a claim in which it was proportionate to remove her to Nigeria.

32. The grounds of appeal are several in number.  There is a  reference  in
    ground 1 to the fact that the judge got the date wrong of her return to
    the United Kingdom in paragraph 2 of  the  decision.   However,  it  is
    plain that this is of no significance because he chose the  right  date
    in another part of the  determination.   In  any  event  it  is  not  a
    significant matter as far as the determination is concerned.

33. Ground 2 raises a matter which had not, as far  as  I  am  aware,  been
    raised in the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal Judge; at least  it
    had not been argued before him.  The judge had not expressly dealt with
    the fact that the appellant was a bereaved partner.  During the  course
    of the hearing this afternoon I have looked to see  whether  there  are
    provisions which permitted the appellant to remain on the basis of  her
    status as a bereaved partner.  They are dealt with in Appendix FM.

34. The identification of the relevant sections is somewhat  difficult  and
    so I am going to identify the relevant passages  by  reference  to  the
    Immigration  Law  Handbook  produced  by  Margaret  Phelan  and   James
    Gillespie (9th edition).  The relevant passages set out on page 1155.

35. The requirements to be met for indefinite leave to remain in the UK  as
    a bereaved partner are that the applicant must be in the United Kingdom
    and must have made a valid application for indefinite leave  to  remain
    as a bereaved partner and must not fall for refusal under  any  of  the
    grounds in the suitability requirements and the applicant must meet all
    the requirements of eligibility for indefinite leave  to  remain  as  a
    bereaved partner.  So much is clear from BPILR.1.1.

36. The eligibility requirements  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  as  a
    bereaved partner are set out in E-BPILR.  Those requirements  establish
    that all of the requirements have to have been  met.   The  requirement
    that the appellant and her partner were in  a  relationship  which  was
    genuine and subsisting and which each of the partners had  intended  to
    be a permanent arrangement was doubtless made out but  that  alone  was
    not enough.

37. The Rules go on at page 1156 to the effect that if  the  applicant  met
    all the requirements for indefinite  leave  to  remain  as  a  bereaved
    partner the applicant would be granted indefinite leave to remain, that
    is D-BPILR.1.1.  However, as far as D-BPILR.1.2  and  the  requirements
    there are concerned, these provide if the applicant does not  meet  the
    requirements for indefinite leave to remain as a bereaved partner  only
    because the suitability requirements  at  1.5.  or  1.6.  applied,  the
    applicant will be granted further limited leave to remain for a  period
    not exceeding 30 months, subject to  a  condition  of  no  recourse  to
    public funds.  Finally, if the applicant does not meet the requirements
    for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  as  a  bereaved  partner  that  the
    application will be refused.

38.  Accordingly  I  have  considered  the  effect   of   the   suitability
    requirements which are set out at page 1152 of Phelan's textbook.   The
    suitability requirements include that the  applicant  will  be  refused
    indefinite leave to remain on grounds of  suitability  if  any  of  the
    following paragraphs applied.  Those paragraphs include at S-ILR.1.4.:

         "The presence of the applicant in the UK is not  conducive  to  the
         public good because they have been  convicted  of  an  offence  for
         which they have been sentenced to imprisonment for less  than  four
         years but at least twelve months, unless a period of fifteen  years
         has passed since the end of the sentence."

39. The appellant has been sentenced to a period of at least twelve  months
    and a period of fifteen years has not  passed  since  the  end  of  the
    sentence.  Accordingly she does not meet the  suitability  requirements
    set out in paragraph 1.4.  It  follows  that  she  does  not  meet  the
    requirement for indefinite leave to remain as a bereaved partner.  That
    does  not  arise  only  because  1.5.  and  1.6.  of  the   suitability
    requirements apply because she does not meet the requirements of 1.4.

40. That rather complex route, however, establishes that whilst  there  was
    no application made by her as the status of a bereaved partner it would
    not have succeeded because she did not meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules in that capacity.  Accordingly the grounds which seek to say that
    the judge failed to take  into  account  her  position  as  a  bereaved
    partner are bound to fail.

41. I need spend no more time on the grounds of appeal.  All  that  I  have
    said so far is directed to the relevant material.  It is said that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge in  ground  4  failed  to  address  and  make
    reasoned findings on the central issue of the appeal, namely  that  the
    respondent issued the appellant with  leave  to  enter  after  she  got
    married to a British citizen whom she took care of until his demise  in
    2014.  It does not seem to me that that is a material consideration  or
    a ground for appeal as a result of the circumstances which I  have  set
    out.

42. There are  also  general  grounds  of  challenge  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge failed to take into account relevant  considerations  or
    reached a decisions not justified by  the  evidence.   I  am  satisfied
    that, although the determination was a short one, this was because  the
    issues were relatively straightforward.   The  outcome  was  an  almost
    inevitable one in view of the appellant's poor immigration history  and
    the circumstances in which she found herself as the widow of a  British
    citizen.

DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal Judge made no error in  his  determination  and  the
determination shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
