For the Appellant:     Mr E. Turfan, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr H. Kannangara of Counsel for the Respondent

                            DECISION AND REASONS

BACKGROUND TO THE APPEAL
1.   The Respondent is a national of Sri Lanka.  She  initially  arrived  in
    the United Kingdom on 18 October 2010, as a  student.   Her  leave  was
    subsequently extended until 19 October 2015.  However,  her  leave  was
    curtailed and she was served with a notice of removal on  15  September
    2014. She applied for leave to remain outside the Immigration Rules  on
    16 October 2016 but her application was refused on 27 January 2016.

2.   The Appellant made a human  rights  claim  on  22  June  2016  and  her
    application was refused on 12 March 2018. She appealed and  her  appeal
    was  allowed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Bennett  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 13 July 2018.  The  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department appealed and First-tier Tribunal Judge  Pickup  granted  her
    permission to appeal on 22 August 2018.

3.   In a decision promulgated on 1  November  2018  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Symes found that there was an error of law in First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Bennett's decision and remitted  the  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to be heard de novo. The appeal then  came  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Rai who allowed the Appellant's  appeal  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 20 September 2019. The Secretary of State  appealed  and
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Chohan granted her permission to appeal on  6
    January 2020.

ERROR OF LAW HEARING
4.   The Home Office Presenting Officer and Counsel for the Respondent  both
    made oral  submissions  and  I  have  referred  to  them  below,  where
    relevant.

ERROR OF LAW DECISION
5.   It is the Appellant's case that the Respondent used  a  proxy  to  take
    her TOEIC speaking test at New London College on 19 March 2013 and then
    relied on the result of this test in relation to  her  application  for
    further leave to remain as a student.  As a consequence, the  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department refused the  Respondent's  application
    for leave on family life grounds under paragraph R-LTRP.1.1.(d)(i)  and
    section S-LTR of Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules.

6.   S-LTR 2.1 provides that:
     "The applicant will normally be refused on grounds  of  suitability  if
    any of paragraphs S-LTR.2.2. to 2.5 apply.

7.   S-LTR.4.2 states:
     "The applicant has made false representations  or  failed  to  disclose
    any material fact in a previous application for...leave to remain".

8.   In her decision the Judge noted that this provision had to  be  applied
    but did not remind herself of any relevant case law. In particular, she
    failed to remind herself that when considering  S-LTR.4.2  she  had  to
    apply a moderately complex test. Firstly, there is an evidential burden
    on the Secretary of State for the Home  Department  to  establish  that
    there is  prima  facie  evidence  to  suggest  that  an  applicant  has
    practiced dishonesty or deception. The evidential burden then shifts to
    the applicant to show that it is at least plausible that  there  is  an
    innocent explanation for the evidence relied upon by the  Secretary  of
    State.  If the applicant meets this test, the legal burden  then  falls
    on the Secretary of State to establish on a  balance  of  probabilities
    that the applicant did practice dishonesty or deception.

9.   She also failed to undertake any such exercise.

10.  Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Judge had  not  needed  to
    do so as the Home Office  Presenting  Officer  had  conceded  that  the
    Appellant had not used any deception when taking  her  TOEIC  test.  In
    particular, he relied on an extract from paragraph 13  of  the  Judge's
    decision which stated:

     "...Ms Ayodele [the Home Office Presenting Officer] accepted  that  the
    appellant had submitted 6 months' payslips and 6 months bank statements
    showing her partner...had an income of over ï¿½18,600. She stated that if
    the appellant could produce an employer's letter confirming  the  same,
    the matter of the English language test would not be an  issue  as  the
    appellant had completed a recognised degree, and the case could proceed
    under the 5 year route".

11.  It is not clear to me why evidence had been  led  in  relation  to  the
    five year route, when paragraph 5 of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Rai's
    decision had noted that the Appellant had applied for leave  to  remain
    outside the Immigration  Rules  and  paragraph  6  indicated  that  her
    application had been considered under the 10 year route.  However,  the
    typed record of proceedings indicates that counsel  for  the  Appellant
    had raised the 5 year route at the hearing and also said  that  English
    language requirement would be met  as  the  Appellant  had  a  Master's
    degree from a [UK]  university.  Paragraph  13  of  the  decision  also
    expressly mentioned the 5  year  route.  Therefore,  the  reference  to
    having completed a recognised degree would appear  to  be  one  in  the
    context of the 5 year route and not one relating to the TOEIC test.

12.  There was a typed record of proceedings on the  Tribunal  file  but  it
    was not easy to follow as at times the Judge did not distinguish  which
    of the two representatives was addressing her. But, it  is  clear  that
    the Appellant was cross-examined about  taking  a  TOEIC  test  at  New
    London College. The record also states that at the end of  the  hearing
    the Home Office Presenting Officer merely stated: "I  make  no  further
    submissions - I ask you to take into  account  the  evidence  you  have
    heard today".

13.  There was then a record of other submissions,  which  would  appear  to
    have been made on behalf of the Appellant and which accepted  that  the
    Respondent had discharged the initial evidential burden in relation  to
    the asserted deception on the part of the  Appellant  but  went  on  to
    assert that the Respondent had  not  done  anything  to  discharge  the
    overall legal burden.

14.  The note of the hearing prepared by Ms Ayodele stated:

      "In  terms  of  the  TOEIC,   I   extensively   cross   examined   the
    appellant...There were no apparent gaps in her evidence.  I  relied  on
    the [refusal letter] as  well  as  the  supplementary  evidence  bundle
    provided for the ETS matter".

15.  Having looked at the totality of the evidence referred to above  in  my
    paragraphs 11 - 14.  I find that Ms Ayodele had not conceded the  TOEIC
    issue and that it remained before First-tier Tribunal Judge Rai.

16.  I have also taken into account the fact that First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Rai did not refer herself to the ETS case, SM and Qadir v Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department (ETS - Evidence - Burden of Proof) [2016]
    UKUT 229 (IAC), in which the Upper Tribunal found that  "the  Secretary
    of State's generic evidence, combined with her evidence  particular  to
    these two appellants, sufficed to discharge the  evidential  burden  of
    proving that their TOEIC certificates had been procured by dishonesty".
    All of this generic evidence was before the Judge. In  addition,  there
    was a report by Professor French but she did not assess it.

17.  At most, she said in paragraph 12 of her decision that she had had
    sight of a supplementary bundle from the Secretary of State regarding
    TOEIC evidence. In addition, she did not take into account the fact
    that as well as generic evidence, there was a report of the
    investigation into tests taken at New London College between 20 March
    2012 and 15 May 2013, which stated that of the 1423 taken during this
    period of time, 1055 were found to be invalid, 368 were found to be
    questionable and none were found to be valid.

18.  The report also noted that during an audit on 14 May 2013 a number of
    "pilots" were seen taking tests on behalf of others and that two test
    takers subsequently admitted under caution that they had used a pilot.
    It was also noted that the same voice had been used in multiple tests.
    The report also noted that documents seized from directors' homes
    showed that the College had kept records from 17 July 2014 which
    recorded the names of each candidate, the representative or pilots they
    had used, their agents' names and the fee paid. As the Respondent
    accepts that she took a test at that college during this period of
    time, the evidential burden fell on her to provide an explanation to
    show that she too had not used a "pilot" to take her test on 19 March
    2013. This was relevant and potentially very damaging evidence which
    needed to have been addressed by the Appellant and the Judge.

19.  Instead, at paragraph 24 of his decision First-tier Tribunal Judge  Rai
    relied on one piece of evidence which indicated that the Respondent had
    obtained a degree from Anglia Ruskin University in April 2015, to  find
    that the Respondent had not used deception in 2013.

20.  I have reminded myself  that  in  Budhathoki  (reasons  for  decisions)
    [2014] UKUT 00341 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal found that:

     "It is generally unnecessary  and  unhelpful  for  First-tier  Tribunal
    judgments to rehearse every detail of issue  raised  in  a  case.  This
    leads to judgments becoming overly long  and  confused  and  is  not  a
    proportionate approach in deciding cases. It is, however, necessary for
    judges to identify and  resolve  key  conflicts  in  the  evidence  and
    explain in clear and brief terms their reasons, so that the parties can
    understand why they have won or lost".

     This principle applied equally to both parties.

21.  The Upper Tribunal also found in MK (duty  to  give  reasons)  Pakistan
    [2013] UKUT 00641 (IAC) that:

     "If a tribunal finds oral evidence to  be  implausible,  incredible  or
    unreliable or a document to  be  worth  no  weight  whatsoever,  it  is
    necessary to say so in that determination and for such findings  to  be
    supported                        by                         reasons..."















































22.  For all of these reasons, I find that First-tier Tribunal Judge Rai
    did err in law in her decision.

23.  Both parties agreed that, due to the fact that First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Rai had not made any sustainable credibility findings on the key
    issues, it would be appropriate to remit the appeal to the First-tier
    Tribunal.

DECISION
(1)  The Secretary of State for the Home Department's appeal is allowed.

(2)  First-tier Tribunal Judge Rail's decision is set aside.

(3)  The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard  de  novo
    by a First-tier Tribunal Judge other than Judges Bennett,  Symes,  Rai,
    Pickup, Chohan or Kaler.
