For the Appellant:     Mr G Hodgetts, Counsel instructed by ATM Law
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is appealing against the decision of First-tier Tribunal
      Judge Bonavero ("the judge") promulgated on 9 August  2019  dismissing
      his human rights claim.

   2. The appellant is a citizen of India who was granted leave to enter the
      UK as a student in November 2007. He subsequently extended his  leave,
      first as a Tier 1 Postgraduate, and then as a Tier 1 General Migrant.

   3. On 5 August 2016 the appellant applied for leave to remain as a Tier 1
      General Migrant. On 3 January 2018 he varied the  application  to  one
      for Indefinite Leave to Remain on the basis  of  10  years  continuous
      long residency under paragraph 276B of the Immigration  Rules.  On  22
      January 2019 the application was refused.


   Decision of the Respondent


   4. The respondent accepted that the appellant had  accrued  10  years  of
      lawful leave as required by paragraph 276B(i)(a)  of  the  Immigration
      Rules but refused his application under 276B(iii)  with  reference  to
      paragraph 322(5). Under paragraph  322(5)  of  the  Immigration  Rules
      leave to enter or remain in the UK should normally be refused  if,  in
      light of the conduct, character or associations of the  applicant,  it
      would be undesirable to permit him or her to remain in the UK.

   5. The reason the respondent considered paragraph  322(5)  applicable  in
      this case was that in an application dated 5 April 2011 for  leave  to
      remain as a Tier 1 General Migrant the appellant claimed that  he  had
      earnings from self-employment of �55,120 covering the period between 1
      March 2010 and 28 February 2011. However, he declared income  of  only
      �1,120 from self-employment to HMRC during  the  corresponding  period
      (covering the 2009/10 and 2010/11 tax years).

   6. The respondent noted that the appellant would not  have  been  granted
      leave as a Tier 1 General Migrant in 2011 if the figures  declared  to
      HMRC had been used in the application for leave to remain.

   7.  The  appellant,  at  the  respondent's  request,  completed   a   tax
      questionnaire. In response to a question  concerning  whether  he  had
      ever corrected or resubmitted a tax return the appellant  answered  in
      the affirmative, giving as  an  explanation  that  there  had  been  a
      miscalculation and negligence by a former  accountant.  The  appellant
      submitted a letter from his current accountant stating that  they  had
      found the miscalculation when asked  by  the  appellant,  in  November
      2015, to review his tax affairs  for  the  previous  five  years.  The
      letter states that  shortly  after  they  brought  the  error  to  the
      appellant's attention he instructed them to amend his tax  return  and
      declare the correct earnings to  HMRC;  and  that  the  amendment  was
      accepted and approved by HMRC without any late filing penalty.

   8. The respondent did not accept the appellant's explanation and found he
      had been dishonest. Several reasons were given. These were:

        a. It was his responsibility to ensure the tax return was correct.


        b. With his application for leave to  remain  in  April  2011,  the
           appellant provided an accountant's letter confirming he had self-
           employment income of �55,120. However, just six months later  he
           declared an income of only �1,120 to HMRC. It is  not  plausible
           that the appellant would be unaware of the difference or that an
           accountant would provide  different  figures  to  HMRC  and  the
           respondent within such a short time period.


        c.  The  appellant  has   qualifications/education   in   business,
           accountancy and auditing.


        d. He amended his 2011 tax  return,  and  paid  the  required  tax,
           shortly before making the application in 2016.  This  timing  is
           indicative of an attempt to rectify the position because of  the
           Immigration application.


        e. The appellant's health issues do not explain why the discrepancy
           occurred.

   9. The respondent  proceeded  to  consider  the  appellant's  family  and
      private life. The application was rejected on human rights grounds  as
      it was not accepted that there  were  very  significant  obstacles  to
      return to India (under paragraph 276 ADE(1)(vi)) or  that  there  were
      circumstances which would render refusal a breach of  article  8  ECHR
      because it would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences.


   Decision of the First tier Tribunal

  10. At paragraph 12 of the decision the judge directed himself that:

         [I]t is for me to  ascertain,  on  the  balance  of  probabilities,
         whether the appellant acted dishonestly in the supplying of figures
         to either HMRC or the Home Office in relation to his  earnings  for
         2010/11


  11. The judge did not believe the appellant and found  that  he  had  been
      dishonest. The judge accepted that the appellant's former  accountants
      dissolved in 2013 and  consequently  did  not  find  damaging  to  his
      credibility the absence of correspondence from them since  that  date.
      However, he reached the conclusion that there were a number of factors
      which, considered together, established that the appellant had, on the
      balance of probabilities, been dishonest. These were:


        a. The scale of the discrepancy. The judge noted that the appellant
           paid income tax in 2010/11 of �215 instead  of  �18,217  (a  tax
           rate of 0.4% rather than 33%).


        b. The appellant's claim that he did not ever communicate with  his
           former accountant in writing was inherently implausible.


        c. Neither the appellant nor his wife suffered from "material  ill-
           health" at the relevant time.


        d.  The  appellant  had  qualifications  in  business   making   it
           inconceivable he would believe he owed so little tax.


        e. The date of repayment to HMRC makes it likely the purpose was to
           facilitate his Immigration application

  12. At paragraph 20 of the decision the judge concluded:

         As is perhaps obvious from the foregoing,  I  do  not  believe  the
         appellant's account. On the balance of probabilities,  and  bearing
         in mind the considerable caution with which a finding of dishonesty
         must be approached, I  find  it  more  likely  than  not  that  the
         appellant was dishonest in the submission of  his  2010  -  11  tax
         return.

  13. At paragraph 21 the judge briefly considered other factors relevant to
      article 8 ECHR, stating:

         I have not been provided with any reasons for which the appellant's
         circumstances in the UK are compelling, or for  which  his  private
         life here is particularly well developed. I note he has  done  some
         charity work in the UK, but I do not find this a weighty factor  in
         my assessment of the proportionality of the appellant's removal.

Grounds of Appeal

  14. There are four grounds of appeal.

  15. First, the grounds submit that the  judge  misapplied  the  burden  of
      proof.

  16. Second, the grounds  argue  that  the  judge's  consideration  of  the
      evidence was inadequate.

  17. Third, it is argued that  the  judge  failed  to  assess  whether  the
      discretion under paragraph 322(5) was appropriate.

  18. Fourth, the grounds submit that  the  assessment  of  the  appellant's
      private life was irrational and failed to take relevant  factors  into
      account.

Analysis

Ground 1: Burden of Proof

  19. It is well established - and was not  in  dispute  before  us  -  that
      where, as in this appeal, dishonesty is alleged, the burden  of  proof
      lies with the respondent in respect of the allegation.

  20. There were two strands to Mr Hodgetts' submissions on  the  burden  of
      proof.

  21. Firstly, he argued that the judge failed to direct himself properly to
      the burden of proof. This submission is unpersuasive because (a) as Mr
      Hodgetts acknowledged, the judge did  not  misstate  the  law  on  the
      burden of proof - rather, he merely did not state it; and  (b)  it  is
      not an error of law for a judge to not set out the law.  What  matters
      is whether, in substance, the law has been properly applied. This  was
      discussed by the Upper Tribunal in another context in  Dube  (ss.117A-
      117D) [2015] UKUT 00090 (IAC) where it was stated in the headnote that
      "it is  not  an  error  of  law  to  fail  to  refer  to  ss.117A-117D
      considerations if the judge  has  applied  the  test  he  or  she  was
      supposed to apply according to its terms; what matters  is  substance,
      not form".  The same applies in this case: what matters is whether the
      judge applied the burden of proof properly, not whether he set it  out
      in the decision.

  22. Secondly, Mr Hodgetts submitted that  the  judge  had,  in  substance,
      placed the burden on the appellant by expecting him to prove he had  a
      medical condition which impeded him from attending to his tax  affairs
      and by giving weight to his inability  to  adduce  evidence  from  his
      former accountants who were dissolved in 2013. This argument fails  to
      appreciate that even though the legal burden fell on the respondent, a
      substantial discrepancy between earnings  declared  to  HMRC  and  the
      respondent can give rise to a justifiable suspicion that calls for  an
      explanation. This was explained in Balajigari v SSHD [2019]  EWCA  Civ
      673 at [42], where it is stated:

         A discrepancy between the earnings declared to HMRC and to the Home
         Office may justifiably give rise to a  suspicion  that  it  is  the
         result of dishonesty but it does not by itself justify a conclusion
         to that effect. What it does is to call for an explanation.  If  an
         explanation once sought is not forthcoming, or is unconvincing,  it
         may at that point be legitimate for the Secretary of State to infer
         dishonesty; but even in that case the position is not that there is
         a legal  burden  on  the  applicant  to  disprove  dishonesty.  The
         Secretary of State must simply decide, considering the  discrepancy
         in the light of the explanation (or lack  of  it),  whether  he  is
         satisfied that the applicant has been dishonest.

  23. We are satisfied that the approach taken by the judge to consideration
      of the evidence was consistent with Balajigari. First,  having  regard
      to the size of the discrepancy, the judge took the view that it called
      for an explanation. Second, he considered the appellant's  explanation
      (along with the evidence  adduced  by  the  appellant)  and  found  it
      unconvincing. Third, the judge, after consideration of  the  evidence,
      reached the conclusion that the appellant had been dishonest. Although
      the judge did not state in terms that  he  found  the  respondent  had
      discharged the burden of proof he did state, at paragraph 20, that  he
      kept in  mind  the  considerable  caution  with  which  a  finding  of
      dishonesty must be approached. Reading the decision as a whole we  are
      satisfied that the judge appreciated that the burden of proof lay with
      the respondent and - in substance -  found  that  the  respondent  had
      discharged the burden.
   Ground 2: Inadequate Consideration of Evidence
  24. Mr Hodgetts, both in the grounds of appeal and  in  oral  submissions,
      advanced several arguments which were intended to show that the  judge
      did not properly consider the evidence and  failed  to  take  evidence
      into account. We consider each of his submissions in turn.

  25. First, Mr Hodgetts submitted that the judge failed to address his mind
      to the possibility  that  the  appellant  was  merely  careless.  This
      contention has no merit because it is plain  that  the  central  issue
      addressed by the judge was whether the appellant  had  been  dishonest
      (as maintained by the respondent) or merely careless  (as  claimed  by
      the appellant). Even from the most cursory of glances at the  decision
      it is apparent that the judge  considered  the  possibility  that  the
      appellant was careless. For example, at paragraph 13 the judge  stated
      that the appellant's case was that his former accountants had  made  a
      mistake and at paragraph 15 he stated that  the  discrepancy  did  not
      necessarily point towards a finding of dishonesty.

  26. Second, it is submitted that the judge failed to take into account the
      evidence of the appellant that his former  accountants  submitted  the
      tax return online without affording him an opportunity  to  check  the
      figures. At paragraph 13 the judge summarised the appellant's case  as
      being that his former accountants made a mistake but, as emphasised by
      Mr Hodgetts, he did not mention that the  appellant  claimed  to  have
      never seen the tax return. However, as observed by  Ms  Fijiwala,  the
      reasons given by the judge for not believing the  appellant  (such  as
      that it was not plausible he would believe he was required to  pay  so
      little tax and that he claimed to have never communicated  in  writing
      with the accountants) addressed the appellant's contention that he did
      not see the tax return before it was written. This submission  is  not
      persuasive because, although the decision is brief and  does  not  set
      out the appellant's case in detail, reading it as a whole it is  clear
      that the judge, when giving his reasons, had in mind  the  appellant's
      claim that he never saw the tax return.

  27. Third, Mr Hodgetts argued that it was irrational for the judge to find
      it implausible that the appellant had no documentation from his former
      accountant given that there is no  expectation  that  a  person  would
      maintain tax records for more than 6 years and  he  could  not  obtain
      copies from the accountancy firm as they had dissolved in  2013.  This
      argument is misconceived  because  the  claim  that  the  judge  found
      implausible was not that the appellant failed to retain documents  but
      that the former accountants never communicated with  him  in  writing.
      The judge was entitled to find  it  is  implausible  that  a  firm  of
      accountants would only communicate with a client orally.  Mr  Hodgetts
      argued that the judge erred by  not  taking  into  account  the  close
      proximity of the accountants to the appellant.  This  argument  cannot
      prevail because (a) the judge did take into account that the appellant
      lived close to the accountants (this  is  explicitly  referred  to  in
      paragraph 16) and (b) an accountant being located close  to  a  client
      does not make it any less implausible that the accountant would  never
      correspond with the client in writing.

  28. Fourth, it is argued that the judge failed to consider evidence  about
      the appellant's, and his wife's, health difficulties at the  time  the
      tax return was completed. This  argument  has  no  merit  because,  as
      highlighted by Ms Fijiwala, the judge recorded at paragraph 17 of  the
      decision that Counsel  for  the  appellant  conceded  this  point.  Mr
      Hodgetts submitted that if the concession was made as recorded by  the
      judge it was wrong and is withdrawn. However, if  the  concession  was
      made then the judge did not err by proceeding in accordance  with  it.
      The alternative - that the concession was not made as recorded by  the
      judge - was not pursued by Mr Hodgetts. He was  right  not  to  do  so
      given the absence of evidence (such as a witness  statement  from  the
      appellant's representative in the First-tier Tribunal) to support such
      a contention.

  29. In any event, the judge's conclusion that the appellant and  his  wife
      were not suffering from "material ill-health" is  entirely  consistent
      with the evidence, which shows no more than that the appellant's  wife
      travelled to India for treatment relating to  IVF/fertility  and  that
      the appellant suffered from leg pain. Given  that  the  appellant  was
      able to build a business and earn over �50,000 in 2010/11 despite  his
      wife's treatment and his leg pain, it was clearly open to the judge to
      find that these health concerns were not sufficiently  distracting  to
      explain why the appellant would not notice that he paid a vastly lower
      rate of tax than would be expected given his income.

  30. Fifth, it is argued that the judge  erred  by  having  regard  to  the
      appellant's qualifications given that he had no relevant expertise  or
      education in accountancy or tax that would equip him to understand his
      tax liability. This contention fails to appreciate that the point made
      by the judge is simply that a person running his own business who  has
      some education in commerce/business  would be unlikely to consider  it
      realistic that he was only expected to pay what the judge described at
      paragraph 18 as "an effective tax rate of 0.4% on his earnings."

  31. Sixth, Mr Hodgetts argued that the judge failed to consider the letter
      from the appellant's current accountants, which is summarised above at
      paragraph 7. However, as pointed out by Ms Fijiwala, the judge in fact
      referred to the most significant contents of the letter  at  paragraph
      9, where he noted that it was the appellant's case  that  his  current
      accountants brought  the  error  by  his  former  accountants  to  his
      attention. In any event,  it  was  not  necessary  for  the  judge  to
      consider  the  letter  in  detail  because  the  appellant's   current
      accountants were not - and did not purport to be - in  a  position  to
      comment on what occurred in 2011.  Mr  Hodgetts  maintained  that  the
      accountant's letter corroborated the appellant's  account  because  it
      showed he did not know that there was a mistake  in  the  2010/11  tax
      return until it was identified  by  his  current  accountants  several
      years later. This argument has  no  merit  because  all  that  can  be
      discerned from the letter is that when the  appellant  instructed  his
      current accountants in November 2015 to review his tax returns for the
      previous five years he did not tell them there was an issue  with  the
      2010/11 return.

  32. Seventh, it is argued that the judge erred by not considering  letters
      attesting to the appellant's good character. Mr  Hodgetts  is  correct
      that the judge did not refer to the letters. However,  the  fact  that
      friends and colleagues think highly of the appellant  -  and  that  he
      engages in charity work - is of little relevance to  the  question  of
      whether, over 8 years ago, whilst in the early stages  of  building  a
      business, he intentionally understated his income to HMRC in order  to
      reduce his tax liability (or overstated his income to  the  respondent
      in order to obtain leave to remain). A judge does not need to refer to
      every item of evidence; and whilst the decision might have been better
      had the letters been mentioned, the failure to refer  to  them,  given
      their limited relevance, does not amount to an error of  law.  In  any
      event, even if the letters were overlooked, this error would not  have
      been material because they  were  only  peripheral  to  the  issue  in
      dispute and, on any legitimate view, would have been given only little
      weight.

  33. Eighth, Mr Hodgetts argued that the  judge  fell  into  error  by  not
      taking into account the letter from HMRC  dated  14  June  2016  which
      confirmed that a penalty for late payment was not imposed. However, it
      is clear from paragraph 9 that the judge took this into consideration,
      as he referred in that paragraph to the appellant's argument that "the
      fact that HMRC chose not to impose a penalty on the appellant when  he
      brought these matters to their attention is highly significant, though
      not dispositive".

  34. Ms Fijiwala, in her submissions, did not address  all  of  the  points
      raised by Mr Hodgetts to support his contention that the evidence  was
      not adequately considered. However, she made the overarching  argument
      that the judge engaged with  the  material  evidence  and  gave  clear
      reasons which support the conclusion reached.  She  characterised  the
      second ground of appeal as a mere  disagreement.  We  agree.  Although
      some of the evidence that was before the First tier Tribunal  was  not
      referred to in the decision (such as the current  accountant's  letter
      and  letters  of  support)  and  other  parts  of  the  evidence  were
      considered only implicitly (such as the letter from HMRC), reading the
      decision as a whole it is clear that the judge has  engaged  with  the
      appellant's central argument - that he was not aware  of  the  mistake
      made by his accountant - and has given cogent  reasons,  supported  by
      the evidence, for rejecting it.

  35. Having addressed the specific points raised by Mr Hodgetts, we  remind
      ourselves that this a case in  which  there  was  a  vast  discrepancy
      between the income declared to HMRC and to the respondent.  The  judge
      found (in a finding that is  unchallenged)  that  the  appellant  paid
      income tax of �215, instead of �18,217, on an income of �55,120 in the
      2010/11 tax year. Nothing in the evidence comes  close  to  explaining
      why the appellant, who is an educated businessman, did not -  even  if
      he never saw the 2010/11 tax return - find it incongruous that despite
      earning over �55,000 in the 2010/11 tax year he was  expected  to  pay
      only  �215  in  tax.  Moreover,  even  if,  because  he  lacked  prior
      experience of the UK tax system, he did not  appreciate  at  the  time
      that he had paid far too little tax, that does not explain why,  after
      seeing how much tax he was required to pay in subsequent years, it did
      not occur to him then that a mistake might have been made in 2011. The
      evidence clearly pointed to this being a  case  of  dishonesty  rather
      than carelessness and therefore even if some of  the  shortcomings  in
      the decision could be characterised as an error of law  (which  we  do
      not accept) they were not material  to  the  outcome  as  the  judge's
      conclusion that the appellant was dishonest was clearly  open  to  him
      and consistent with the evidence.

Ground 3: Discretion under paragraph 322(5)

  36. Paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules  involves  the  respondent
      undertaking a two-stage  analysis.   The  first  stage  is  to  decide
      whether it is undesirable to grant leave to an applicant in the  light
      of his or her dishonesty. If it is, the  second  stage  -  since  such
      undesirability is  a  presumptive  rather  than  mandatory  ground  of
      refusal - is to decide as a matter of discretion whether leave  should
      be refused.  The  second  stage  involves  consideration  of  whether,
      notwithstanding the undesirability  of  the  applicant  being  granted
      leave, there are factors outweighing the presumption that leave should
      be refused. In Balajigari at [39] the Court of Appeal explained:

         There will, though no doubt only exceptionally, be cases where  the
         interests of children or others, or serious problems about  removal
         to their country of origin, mean that it would be wrong  to  refuse
         leave to remain (though not necessarily indefinite leave to remain)
         to migrants whose presence is undesirable.

  37. The grounds submit that the judge erred by "failing to assess  whether
      the  discretion  under  paragraph  322  (5)  was  appropriate".   This
      submission is not developed in the grounds of appeal and was mentioned
      only briefly by Mr Hodgetts at the hearing. It is not  entirely  clear
      what point is being made, but our understanding is that the  appellant
      is contending that the judge did not, after having  found  that  there
      was dishonesty, consider  whether,  notwithstanding  that  dishonesty,
      refusal of leave was appropriate. There is no merit to this submission
      as it is clear that the  judge  did  not  dismiss  the  appeal  solely
      because he found the appellant had been dishonest  but,  at  paragraph
      21, considered whether there were factors weighing in his favour.

   Ground 4: Assessment of private life under Article 8


  38. Mr Hodgetts argued that  the  judge's  assessment  of  article  8  was
      deficient because he did not  consider  the  obstacles  the  appellant
      would face integrating in India or the strength of his private life in
      the UK. Ms Fijiwala submitted in response that it did not appear  that
      any arguments had been made in the First-tier Tribunal to support  the
      contention that was now being  advanced.  She  also  argued  that  the
      appellant could not conceivably succeed  under  article  8  given  the
      weight that must be given to his dishonesty.

  39. We agree with Ms  Fijiwala.  The  judge  cannot  be  faulted  for  not
      addressing a point that was not put to him. In any event, the  judge's
      assessment of article 8,  although  brief,  is  sufficient  given  the
      circumstances of the case. In the article 8 proportionality assessment
      there was little that could weigh in the appellant's  favour.  He  has
      been in the UK a long time and has  developed  friendships  (and  been
      involved in charity work) but this private life was  established  when
      his immigration status was precarious and, in accordance with s117B(5)
      of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, can be given  only
      little weight. Moreover, this is clearly not a case where there  would
      be obstacles (let alone very significant obstacles) to integration  in
      India given the appellant's (and his wife's) close connection  to  the
      country. It is notable that his wife travelled to  India  for  medical
      treatment, which is strongly indicative of being an insider  in  India
      in terms of understanding how life is carried on and having a capacity
      to participate in it. Given the finding of deception, it  was  clearly
      open to the judge to conclude that the appellant's private life in the
      UK did not outweigh  the  public  interest  in  effective  immigration
      controls.

Decision

  40. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making  of
      a material error of law.

  41. The appeal is dismissed.
