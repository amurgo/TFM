    Representation:

                            For the Appellant: Ms J Isherwood a
           Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
                            For the Respondent: Mr A Wattoo a
           solicitor from Sky Solicitors Ltd

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is the Entry Clearance Officer  in  Riyadh  ("the  entry
      clearance officer") the Respondent is a citizen of  Pakistan  who  was
      born on 1 January 1984 ("the applicant"). The entry clearance  officer
      has been given permission to appeal the  determination  of  First-Tier
      Tribunal Judge Woodhouse  ("the  FTTJ")  who  allowed  the  claimant's
      appeal against the respondent's decision of 9 February 2013 to  refuse
      his application for entry clearance to come to the UK as a visitor  in
      order to get married under the provisions  of  paragraph  56D  of  the
      Immigration Rules.


   2. The entry clearance officer refused the application on the basis  that
      the claimant had  failed  to  produce  any  evidence  to  confirm  the
      arrangements  for  the  wedding  or  that  he  was  in   the   claimed
      relationship with his sponsor. The entry  clearance  officer  was  not
      satisfied that the claimant had demonstrated that he was travelling to
      the UK for the period  or  purpose  claimed.  It  was  said  that  the
      claimant's rights of appeal were limited to the grounds referred to in
      section 84 (1) (c) of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act  2002
      ("the 2002 Act").


   3. The claimant appealed and the application was reviewed  by  the  Entry
      Clearance Manager who upheld the decision. The claimant  appealed  and
      the FTTJ heard the  appeal  on  25  October  2013.  The  claimant  was
      represented but the entry clearance officer was not.  The  FTTJ  heard
      evidence from the claimant's sponsor, Ms Rozena Ali ("the sponsor").


   4. The FTTJ found the sponsor to be a credible witness. She was a British
      citizen by birth and in full-time employment as a Legal Executive. She
      accepted that the sponsor and the claimant were engaged to be  married
      and in a genuine and continuing relationship.  They  were  in  regular
      contact. The claimant and the sponsor were  aware  that  a  Nikah  was
      insufficient evidence of marriage on its own to enable the claimant to
      make  an  application  for  settlement  as  a  spouse.  They  had  had
      considerable difficulty in establishing the precise  requirements  for
      the notification of registration in order to get married in a registry
      office  in  this  country.  Initially,  they  had  been   misinformed.
      Eventually, it was established that the claimant would have to  be  in
      this country and have at least seven days residency before they  could
      give the required notice in order to get married. They could  not  get
      married in Saudi Arabia because the sponsor could not go there without
      being accompanied by a suitable male relative which she was unable  to
      do.


   5. The FTTJ found that no issues had been  raised  about  the  claimant's
      income or employment. She was satisfied that the claimant intended  to
      come here in order to marry the sponsor and  then  returned  to  Saudi
      Arabia in order to make a settlement  application.  The  claimant  had
      shown that he met the requirements of  paragraph  56D  (i),  (ii)  and
      (iii) of the Immigration Rules.


   6. The FTTJ also found that to refuse the claimant entry clearance  would
      be a disproportionate interference with his right to respect  for  his
      Article 8 private life rights.


   7. The FTTJ allowed the appeal both under the Immigration  Rules  and  on
      Article 8 human rights grounds.


   8. The entry clearance officer applied for and was granted permission  to
      appeal. The grounds argue that the  FTTJ  erred  in  law  firstly,  by
      failing to give any clear indication as  to  the  date  at  which  the
      evidence was assessed. This should have been the date of decision on 9
      February 2013. Furthermore, it was not clear what documentary evidence
      the FTT relied on when stating that this was sufficient to  show  that
      the requirements of the Immigration Rules were met. Secondly, the FTTJ
      made a "material  misdirection"  by  allowing  the  appeal  under  the
      Immigration Rules. Finally, the Article 8  findings  were  inadequate.
      The FTTJ should have considered whether the claimant and  the  sponsor
      could have  continued  their  relationship  through  modern  means  of
      communication until such time as the appellant was able to satisfy the
      requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  in  order  to  obtain  entry
      clearance as a spouse/fianc�e.


   9. The appeal came before  me  1  May  2014.  I  issued  a  Decision  and
      Directions dated 2 May 2014 which is set out in the Appendix  to  this
      determination. I found that the FTTJ erred in law by  considering  and
      allowing the appeal under paragraphs 56D  and  E  of  the  Immigration
      Rules. She had no jurisdiction to do so. The claimant's only right  of
      appeal  against  the  decision  was   on   the   grounds   of   racial
      discrimination by a public authority or on human rights grounds  under
      the provisions of section  84  of  the  2002  Act.  As  there  was  no
      suggestion of racial discrimination the only grounds of appeal open to
      the claimant were human rights grounds and, in  the  circumstances  of
      this case, Article 8 grounds.


  10. I set aside the decision of the FTTJ, adjourning it to be re-made at a
      later date and giving Directions as to what  should  be  done  in  the
      meantime.


  11. The sponsor attended  the  adjourned  hearing  before  me.  I  have  a
      skeleton argument from Mr Wattoo, a composite bundle lodged on  behalf
      of the claimant which I am told contains all the material on which the
      claimant relies, a copy of the Immigration  Appeals  (Family  Visitor)
      Regulations 2012 and the Determination of the Upper Tribunal in  Fetle
      (Partners:  two-year  requirements)  [2014]  UKUT  00267   (IAC).   Ms
      Isherwood submitted AS (Somalia) & Anor v Secretary of State  for  the
      Home Department [2009] UKHL 32 (17 June  2009) and  Shahzad  (Art  8:
      legitimate aim) Pakistan [2014] UKUT 85 (IAC) (26 February 2014).


  12. At the hearing before me on 1 May 2014 Mr  Wattoo  conceded  that  the
      claimant could not  bring  himself  within  any  of  the  relationship
      categories  set  out  in  the  Immigration  Appeals  (Family  Visitor)
      Regulations 2002 ("the 2002 Regulations"), that section 88 of the 2002
      applied and that as a result the  claimant  had  no  right  of  appeal
      against the entry clearance officer's decision except on  the  grounds
      of racial discrimination by a public  authority  or  on  human  rights
      grounds under the provisions of section 84 of the 2002 act.  As  there
      was no suggestion of racial discrimination the only grounds of  appeal
      open to him were human rights grounds and,  in  the  circumstances  of
      this case, Article 8 grounds. Mr Wattoo indicated that in the light of
      the determination in Fetle the claimant now  wished  to  withdraw  the
      concession and argue that the claimant did after all have a full right
      of appeal against the decision to refuse  him  entry  clearance  as  a
      visitor under the Immigration Rules. He accepted that Fetle was not  a
      case relating to visitors rights of appeal but argued that  it  helped
      the claimant by analogy. He now wished to argue that the FTTJ had  not
      erred  in  law  and  that  the  decision  should  be  upheld.  In  the
      alternative the appeal should be allowed on  Article  8  human  rights
      grounds.


  13. Ms Isherwood objected to the application and said that  she  had  been
      taken by surprise, regarding this as an issue which had  already  been
      resolved.


  14. The representatives agreed  that  I  should  hear  evidence  from  the
      sponsor, submissions from both of them and then determine  all  issues
      including Mr Wattoo's application.


  15. I heard brief oral evidence from the sponsor. Initially, Ms  Isherwood
      indicated that she would not wish to cross examine. However,  after  I
      had asked the sponsor some questions for the purpose of  clarification
      Ms Isherwood did ask some questions in cross examination. There was no
      re-examination. The sponsor's evidence is set  out  in  my  record  of
      proceedings.


  16. In  her  submissions  Ms  Isherwood  relied  on  the  entry  clearance
      officer's decision and  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager's  review.  The
      latest witness  statement  from  the  sponsor  added  nothing  to  the
      evidence which was before the FTTJ. The claimant  had  applied  for  a
      rule 56D visitor's visa in order to get married. Question  97  in  the
      application form asked; "what would you do  after  the  marriage/civil
      partnership ceremony?" to which the  claimant  replied;  "I  will  not
      bring my wife back to Madinah. She has a good  job  I  would  like  to
      extend visa or on my return to Madinah  I  would  like  to  apply  for
      settlement visa if I can apply from UK then I will try if not  I  will
      apply on returning. Supporting letter given."  She  argued  that  this
      called into question the claimant's intention to leave the UK  at  the
      end of the visit. There were documents in the claimant's bundle  which
      indicated that he was looking for a job in this country.


  17. Ms Isherwood submitted that the claimant and  the  sponsor  should  at
      least have considered the possibility of getting married in  Pakistan.
      In reply to my question as to the entry clearance  officer's  position
      as to whether there was  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  Ms
      Isherwood said that much of the evidence put forward by  the  claimant
      in the bundle was untranslated. There was  little  evidence  prior  to
      2012. Her submission was that they had not established a  genuine  and
      subsisting relationship.  However,  she  accepted  that  she  had  not
      challenged this in her cross examination.


  18. Ms Isherwood argued that the Article 8 grounds should be  assessed  in
      the light of the evidence at the date of the decision. She  relied  on
      AS Somalia. In reply to my question as to whether I should  adopt  the
      findings of fact made by the FTTJ, Ms  Isherwood  submitted  that  the
      claimant and the sponsor had got it wrong  about  the  effect  of  the
      Nikah. It was not clear why they had not applied for a  fianc�e  visa.
      It could well be because they  knew  that  they  could  not  meet  the
      accommodation and maintenance requirements for entry as a fiancee.  Ms
      Isherwood could not point me to anything in the determination  of  the
      FTTJ which supported the submission that the evidence been  considered
      at an incorrect date. In relation to the Art 8  grounds  she  accepted
      that I needed to look at Gulshan principles (Gulshan (Article 8 -  new
      Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC)). She  submitted  that
      the claimant  could  not  succeed  on  Article  8  grounds  under  the
      Immigration  Rules.  The  evidence  did   not   establish   compelling
      circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the Immigration Rules.


  19. In relation to the question of appeal rights, Ms  Isherwood  submitted
      that the combination of Fetle and the 2002 Regulations  did  not  give
      the claimant a full right of appeal. Fetle was a  refugee  case  under
      entirely different provisions. I was asked to find that  the  claimant
      did not have a full right  of  appeal,  to  remake  the  decision  and
      dismiss the claimant's appeal.


  20. Mr Wattoo submitted that the claimant and the sponsor had  been  in  a
      relationship since September 2009. That  is  when  their  relationship
      started. They got engaged on 16 July 2012. He accepted that  this  was
      not two years before the date of decision on 9 February 2013. However,
      his submission was that they had been  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
      relationship for at least two years before the date of decision.  This
      was akin to marriage or a civil partnership. There  was  no  need  for
      cohabitation at any time  during  the  relevant  period.  The  crucial
      factor was the strength of the relationship. The parties had  been  in
      regular contact and some of the evidence of this was  in  English.  He
      asked me to adopt the findings of credibility and  fact  made  by  the
      FTTJ. Ms Isherwood had not cross examined the  sponsor  or  challenged
      her credibility.


  21. In relation  to  the  Article  8  grounds  Mr  Wattoo  relied  on  the
      provisions outside the Immigration Rules and accepted that I needed to
      apply Gulshan principles. He  submitted  that  there  were  compelling
      circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised  under  the  Rules.   The
      claimant made the type of application he did because he was doing what
      the entry clearance officer suggested. He should not be penalised  for
      this. There was clear evidence that they  could  not  get  married  in
      Saudi Arabia. It was understandable and reasonable that  the  claimant
      would want her family to be present at the ceremony. Realistically the
      only place where this could happen was in the UK.


  22. Mr Wattoo submitted that, read carefully, the documentary evidence did
      not indicate that the claimant had been trying to find a  job  in  the
      UK. He had made his intentions clear at all times; he would leave  the
      UK after the visit. There was evidence of this  in  the  form  of  the
      letter from his employer and the return air ticket.  The  sponsor  had
      visited the claimant in Saudi Arabia on three  occasions;  July  2009,
      March 2010 and July 2012 when  they  got  engaged.  There  was  strong
      evidence supporting the contention that the relationship  was  genuine
      and subsisting not least the perseverance with which they had  pursued
      the appeal process.  The  sponsor's  father  was  unwell  and  it  was
      difficult to him to travel.


  23. Mr Wattoo asked me to find that the  claimant  had  a  full  right  of
      appeal, to conclude that the FTTJ had not after all erred in  law  and
      to preserve her decision allowing the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
      Rules. In the alternative I was asked to allow the appeal on Article 8
      human rights grounds outside the Immigration Rules.


  24. I reserved my determination.


  25. The Immigration Appeals (Family Visitor) Regulations 2012 provide;

         "The Secretary of State, in exercise of  the  powers  conferred  by
         sections 88A(1)(a),  2(a)  and  (c)  and  112(1)  and  (3)  of  the
         Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002(1),   makes   the
         following Regulations:


         Citation and commencement

         1.  These Regulations may be  cited  as  the  Immigration  Appeals
         (Family Visitor) Regulations 2012 and shall come into force on  9th

         Class or description of person to be visited

         2.  (1) A person ("P") is of a class or description prescribed for

         of the immigration rules;

         (b) has been granted asylum in the United Kingdom under paragraph
         334(3) of the immigration rules; or

         (c) has been granted humanitarian protection in the United Kingdom
         under paragraph 339C(4) of the immigration rules.


         Transitional provision

         4. These Regulations  apply  only  to  an  application  for  entry
         clearance made on or after the day on which they come into force."

  26. Mr Wattoo submits that the claimant  is  a  member  of  the  sponsor's
      family because they have been in a relationship  that  is  akin  to  a
      marriage or civil partnership for at least the two  years  before  the
      day on which his application for entry clearance was made (9  February
      2013).


  27. The summary of the decision in Fetle, prepared by the author  of  that
      determination states; "In contrast to  the  requirement  of  para  GEN
      1.2(iv) of Appendix FM, a requirement (such as in paragraph  352AA  of
      the Immigration Rules) that "parties have been living  together  in  a
      relationship akin to either a marriage or a  civil  partnership  which
      has subsisted for two years or  more";  does  not  require  two  years
      cohabitation, but two years subsistence of the relationship.   Whether
      the relationship still subsists, as required  by  the  tense  of  that
      requirement and as may be separately required, is a different issue.


  28. There is an important difference between the provision in Appendix FM
      addressed in Fetle and that in  the  2012  Regulations  which  I  must
      assess. The former includes the words; "living  together"  whilst  the
      latter does not. They have not been living together but  this  matters
      not because it  is  not  a  requirement  of  this  part  of  the  2012
      Regulations. It is clear that  they  wish  to  get  married  and  they
      consider themselves engaged to be married. It is  equally  clear  that
      they are not yet married. I find that they are not in  a  relationship
      which is akin to a marriage or civil partnership. As I read Fetle some
      degree of cohabitation, which need not have subsisted for as  long  as
      two years, is required for a relationship to be akin to a marriage  or
      civil partnership. Understandably in view  of  their  backgrounds  the
      claimant  and  the  sponsor   do   not   claim   to   have   cohabited
      notwithstanding Mr Wattoo's valiant effort to suggest that they  might
      have done so by virtue of the fact that they spent at least one  night
      under the same roof in the same hotel in Saudi Arabia but in different
      rooms. Furthermore, I find that they have not been in  a  relationship
      showing a sufficient degree of commitment and permanence for at  least
      the two years before the  day  on  which  the  application  for  entry
      clearance was made. They met in September 2009 and their  relationship
      grew as they got to know each other  better,  mostly  at  a  distance,
      until they got engaged on 16 July 2012. I find that  the  duration  of
      the relationship was  between  16  July  2012  and  the  date  of  the
      application which is less than two years. The date of the  application
      is not clear but it was either on 9 February 2013  or  shortly  before
      that.


  29. I conclude that that the claimant cannot bring himself within  any  of
      the relationship categories set out  in  the  2002  Regulations,  that
      section 88 of the 2002 Act applies and that as a result  the  claimant
      has no right of appeal against the entry clearance officer's  decision
      except on the grounds of racial discrimination by a  public  authority
      or on human rights grounds under the provisions of section 84  of  the
      2002 Act. As there was no suggestion of racial discrimination the only
      grounds of appeal open to him are human rights  grounds  and,  in  the
      circumstances of this case, Article 8 grounds. In this regard I see no
      reason to amend this conclusion in my earlier Decision and  Directions
      or the conclusion that the FTTJ erred in law in this regard.


  30. The claimant can only succeed on Article 8 human rights grounds. It is
      not suggested and I find that  he  cannot  bring  himself  within  the
      Article 8 requirements in the Immigration Rules.


  31. In the circumstances I apply the principles set out in Gulshan
      (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC). The
      summary of the provisions of Gulshan, prepared by the author of that
      determination Cranston J states;


           "On the current state of the authorities:


           (a)    the maintenance requirements  of  E-LTRP.3.1-3.2  stand,
           although Blake J in R (on the application of MM)  v Secretary of
           State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) said that
           they  could  constitute  an  unjustified  and   disproportionate
           interference with the ability of spouses to  live  together;  he
           suggested that an appropriate figure may be around �13,400,  and
           highlighted the position of young people and  low  wage  earners
           caught by the higher figure in the rules;
           (b)    after applying the requirements of the  Rules,  only  if
           there may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to  remain
           outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on  to
           consider  whether  there  are   compelling   circumstances   not
           sufficiently recognised under them: R (on the  application  of)
           Nagre v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013]  EWHC
           720 (Admin);
           (c)    the term "insurmountable obstacles" in provisions such as
           Section  EX.1  are  not  obstacles  which  are   impossible   to
           surmount: MF (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012]  UKUT  393
           (IAC); Izuazu (Article 8 - new rules) [2013] UKUT 45 (IAC); they
           concern  the  practical  possibilities  of  relocation.  In  the
           absence of such insurmountable obstacles,  it  is  necessary  to
           show other non-standard and  particular  features  demonstrating
           that removal will be unjustifiably harsh: Nagre.


           The Secretary of State addressed the Article 8 family aspects of
           the respondent's position through the Rules, in particular  EX1,
           and the private life aspects through paragraph 276ADE. The judge
           should  have  done  likewise,  also  paying  attention  to   the
           Guidance. Thus the judge should have considered the Secretary of
           State's conclusion under EX.1 that there were no  insurmountable
           obstacles preventing the continuation of the family life outside
           the UK. Only if there were arguably good  grounds  for  granting
           leave to remain outside the rules was it necessary for  him  for
           Article 8 purposes to go  on  to  consider  whether  there  were
           compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised  under  the
           Rules."


  32. I find that there are arguably good  grounds  for  granting  leave  to
      enter outside the Immigration Rules. The Rules  provide  a  route  for
      entry as a visitor in order to marry under paragraphs 56D but  do  not
      give a right of appeal against a refusal except, in the  circumstances
      of this case, on Article 8 human rights grounds.


  33.  I  must  consider   whether   there   are   sufficiently   compelling
      circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the Immigration Rules.


  34. The FTTJ found the sponsor to be a credible witness. Ms Isherwood  did
      not challenge her credibility in cross examination. I have reached the
      same conclusion as the  FTTJ.  I  find  the  sponsor  to  be  credible
      witness. I find that at the dates of the application and decision  she
      and the claimant were engaged to be married  and  had  a  genuine  and
      settled intention to get married, which has  not  changed  since.  The
      strength of the relationship has been  tested  but  has  survived  the
      prolonged application and appeals process. I accept that the appellant
      and the sponsor made the type of application they did because this was
      suggested to them by the entry clearance officer.


  35. The answers given by the claimant to Ms Isherwood in cross examination
      did nothing to support  her  contention  that  the  claimant  and  the
      appellant should get married in Pakistan or at least have explored the
      possibility of doing so. The claimant, whilst a citizen  of  Pakistan,
      with some family living there, has been living and  working  in  Saudi
      Arabia for more than seven years where he has a good job. The  sponsor
      is British and British born. She said that the last generation of  her
      family to live in Pakistan  were  her  great  great-grandparents.  She
      speaks Urdu and Punjabi but her first languages  are  equally  English
      and Urdu. She had a good job here as a Legal Executive.


  36. Having concluded that at the dates of the application and decision  it
      was the intention of the claimant and the sponsor to get  married  and
      to get married in the UK I find that it should  not  be  held  against
      them that they received inaccurate advice. The sponsor  never  thought
      that  a  Nikah  on  its  own  would  suffice.  They  had  considerable
      difficulty in finding out exactly what was required,  were  originally
      misinformed  and  only  later  enquiries   established   the   precise
      requirements for residence and notice in order to  get  married  in  a
      registry office in this country.


  37. The claimant and the sponsor had always believed that it would be very
      difficult or impossible for them to get married in Saudi Arabia.  They
      thought that this was the case  because  she  could  not  enter  Saudi
      Arabia without an acceptably close male relative and no such  relative
      was available through a combination of  circumstances  including  cost
      and ill-health. It was also thought that the  type  of  Saudi  Arabian
      visa which she had been able to obtain in  order  to  visit  on  three
      previous occasions (an Umrah visa) might not enable her to get married
      there. Subsequent enquiries have shown and I find that she  would  not
      be able to obtain a visa which would enable  her  to  marry  in  Saudi
      Arabia.


  38. I find that the claimant and the sponsor met in September 2009. Whilst
      some of the documentary evidence is post application and some  is  not
      in English I accept the sponsor's evidence  that  they  have  been  in
      regular contact ever since, usually every day. They got engaged to  be
      married in July 2012.


  39. I find that the emails referred to by Ms  Isherwood  do  not  indicate
      that either the claimant or the sponsor had been looking for a job for
      him in the UK. Her oral evidence was  that  after  the  marriage  they
      would live in her house and then decide what to do. She  thought  that
      she might be able to get a job in  Saudi  Arabia  and  live  with  him
      there. Another possibility was that he would be able to get a  job  in
      the UK and they would be able to live together here. However I  accept
      her unequivocal answer that he would go back to  Saudi  Arabia  before
      his visa expired and that this had always been  their  intention.  The
      sponsor's current hope that she might be able to get a  job  in  Saudi
      Arabia does not tally with the claimant's answer to question 97  where
      he said that he would not take her to Madinah but I find that this  is
      of little importance compared with their consistent statements that if
      nothing else could be achieved before  his  visitor  visa  expired  he
      would go back to Saudi Arabia and make  a  marriage  application  from
      there.


  40. I find that the claimant has established that he  wishes  to  come  to
      this country in order to marry the sponsor, that if he has to go  back
      to Saudi Arabia to make a marriage settlement application he  will  do
      so and that he will not overstay his visitor visa.  I  find  that  the
      claimant and the sponsor cannot get married in Saudi Arabia. It is not
      reasonable to expect them to get married in Pakistan. It has not  been
      suggested that there is anywhere else where it would be reasonable for
      them to attempt to get married. I find that if the claimant is granted
      a visitor visa they can and will get married in this country.


  41. I find that all but the last of the Razgar tests are answered  in  the
      affirmative  leaving  the  question  of  the  proportionality  of  the
      proposed interference. Maintenance of effective  immigration  control,
      whilst not in itself a legitimate aim, is an aspect of  prevention  of
      disorder or crime or an aspect  of  the  economic  well-being  of  the
      country. I find that maintenance of effective immigration control does
      not weigh heavily in favour of the entry clearance officer  where  the
      claimant has at all times observe the Immigration Rules and  done  his
      best to bring himself within their provisions. Clearly the Immigration
      Rules anticipate that individuals should  be  able  to  come  to  this
      country as visitors in order to get  married.  The  claimant  is  only
      prevented from further efforts to do so because of the lack of a  full
      right of appeal. I find that there are  compelling  circumstances  not
      sufficiently recognised under the Immigration Rules which would amount
      to a  disproportionate  interference  with  the  claimant's  right  to
      respect for his and the sponsor's Article 8 family life.


  42. Having set aside the decision of the FTTJ I remake the decision. Under
      the Immigration Rules there is  no  right  of  appeal  as  a  visitor.
      However, I allow the claimant's  appeal  on  Article  8  human  rights
      grounds.

                                  APPENDIX

                                 DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


   1. The appellant is the Entry Clearance Officer in Riyadh ("the Entry
      Clearance Officer"). The respondent is a citizen of Pakistan who was
      born 1 January 1984 ("the claimant"). The Entry Clearance Officer has
      been given permission to appeal the determination of First-Tier
      Tribunal Judge Woodhouse ("the FTTJ") who allowed the claimant's
      appeal against the Entry Clearance Officer decision of 9 February 2013
      to refuse him entry clearance to the UK as a visitor. The claimant
      wanted to come here to marry his fianc�e, the sponsor. The refusal was
      made under the provisions of paragraph 56D of the Immigration Rules
      which set out the requirements for leave to enter as a visitor for
      marriage or to enter into a civil partnership.


   2. The Entry Clearance Officer refused the application on the basis that
      the claimant had failed to produce any evidence to confirm
      arrangements for the wedding or civil partnership or evidence that he
      was in a relationship with the sponsor. The ceremony which they said
      they wish to go through would not be recognised as a valid UK
      marriage. The claimant had not established that he would be travelling
      to the UK for the period or purpose claimed.


   3. The claimant appealed and the FTTJ heard his appeal on 25 October 13.
      The claimant was represented but the Entry Clearance Officer was not.
      The FTTJ heard evidence from the sponsor. In paragraph 6 the FTTJ
      records the claimant's representative's acknowledgement that the
      claimant only had a limited right of appeal on human rights grounds.


   4. Having heard evidence from the sponsor the FTTJ found her to be a
      credible witness and that the claimant had shown that he met the
      requirements of paragraphs 56D and E of the Immigration Rules. She
      allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules and on Article 8 human
      rights grounds.


   5. The Entry Clearance Officer applied for and was granted permission to
      appeal, submitting that the FTTJ erred in law by failing to indicate
      the date at which the evidence was considered, taking into account
      post decision evidence and making inadequate findings in relation to
      the Article 8 grounds. Permission to appeal was granted and the judge
      who granted permission to appeal pointed out that the Entry Clearance
      Officer's decision attracted only a limited right of appeal on human
      rights or race discrimination grounds.


   6. At the hearing before me both representatives accepted that the
      claimant could not bring himself within any of the relationship
      categories set out in the Immigration Appeals (Family Visitor)
      Regulations 2002 and that as a result S88 of the Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 applied. The claimant had no right of
      appeal against the decision except on the grounds of racial
      discrimination by a public authority or on human rights grounds under
      the provisions of S84 of the 2002 Act. As there was no suggestion of
      racial discrimination the only grounds of appeal open to him were
      human rights grounds and, in the circumstances of this case, Article 8
      grounds.


   7. Both representatives agreed and I find that the FTTJ erred in law by
      considering and allowing the appeal under paragraphs 56D and E of the
      Immigration Rules. She had no jurisdiction to deal with this appeal on
      these grounds. She did have jurisdiction to consider the appeal on
      Article 8 human rights grounds but I find that her treatment of these
      grounds was brief and superficial and the outcome was largely as a
      result of her having allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules. I
      find that this was an error of law.


   8. Having found that the FTTJ erred in law I set aside her decision. I
      indicated to the representatives that I was inclined to re-determine
      the appeal without an adjournment. The claimant's representatives had
      not submitted any further evidence in advance of the hearing. I heard
      submissions from both representatives in connection with the course of
      action to be taken. The Entry Clearance Officer has criticised the
      findings of fact made by the FTTJ, arguing that it was not clear
      whether these were made at the correct date. If that is correct then
      there is no clear factual matrix on which I could re-determine the
      appeal. On instructions Mr Wattoo said that the sponsor wished to give
      further evidence which, it would be submitted, indicated that it was
      impossible or at best impractical for the claimant and the sponsor to
      marry in Saudi Arabia. Whilst I am conscious that the claimant's
      representatives should have submitted any further evidence in advance
      of the hearing I conclude that fairness dictates that the Article 8
      grounds be re-heard in the Upper Tribunal with all issues at large and
      that the claimant be permitted to submit further admissible evidence.
