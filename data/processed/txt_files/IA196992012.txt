Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms P Solanke, instructed by Farani Taylor,
Solicitors

     Mr J McGirr, Home Office Presenting Officer (19 June 2013)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the  appellant  against  a  determination  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal issued on 5 December  2012  dismissing  his  appeal
    against the respondent's decision made on 29 June 2007 to deport him on
    the grounds that the respondent deemed it to be conducive to the public
    good.


Background

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Algeria, born on 19 May 1970.   He  first
    came to the UK on 25 April 1989 and was granted leave  to  enter  as  a
    visitor for six months, his leave later being extended until  19  April
    1990.  He was granted further leave to remain as the spouse of a person
    present and settled in the UK on 27 October 1993 and  indefinite  leave
    to remain as a spouse on 7 February 1995.

3.   On 27  April  2004  he  was  convicted  at  Southwark  Crown  Court  of
    conspiracy to defraud and on 2 April 2004  sentenced  to  three  years'
    imprisonment.  On 31 March 2005 the appellant was served with a  notice
    of liability for deportation.  He replied setting out  reasons  why  he
    should not be deported.  He was released from prison on  20  May  2005.
    On 15 February 2007 the respondent decided to make a deportation  order
    but checks on the appellant's last known  permanent  address  were  not
    successful and a visit by an enforcement  officer  did  not  yield  any
    results.  The appellant was listed as an absconder and the decision was
    served on file on 29 June 2007.  A deportation order was signed  on  28
    August 2007.  The appellant came to light on 22 August 2012 when he was
    arrested at his place of work.  The deportation order was served on  31
    August 2012.

4.   His appeal was heard by the First-tier Tribunal on  23  November  2012.
    The Tribunal heard evidence from the appellant, his daughter Laila, one
    of his step-daughters Jessica, his former wife and a business  partner.
    The Tribunal sitting as a panel was satisfied that  the  appellant  was
    liable to deportation  as  the  respondent  deemed  deportation  to  be
    conducive to the public good.  It went on to consider whether  removing
    him from the UK would be  in  breach  of  his  article  8  rights.   It
    accepted that he had a daughter and two step-daughters  living  in  the
    UK.  His daughter, Laila, was 18 years old.   She  had  given  evidence
    about her health saying that she suffered from rectal bleeding and felt
    sick all the time.  She did not know much about Algeria but  knew  that
    her grandmother, the appellant's brother and cousins lived there.   The
    panel noted Laila's lack of  knowledge  about  her  father's  life  and
    describing it as inconsistent with her claim that they were very  close
    to  each  other  (29).   It  found  that  she  was   exaggerating   her
    relationship with him as she had exaggerated her medical  condition  in
    order to assist him in this appeal.  It found that  the  appellant  and
    Laila had normal ties as expected between an adult child and a  parent.



5.   The panel also accepted  that  the  appellant  had  two  step-daughters
    living in the UK but they were adults and no longer lived at home.   It
    found that the decision to deport the  appellant  would  not  interfere
    with his, his step-daughters' or their children's right to their family
    life.

6.   The panel heard evidence from  the  appellant's  business  partner  who
    claimed that he had entered  into  a  business  relationship  with  the
    appellant.  It did not find it credible that he would not have enquired
    in more  detail  about  his  criminal  history  before  establishing  a
    business relationship and commented on  the  lack  of  any  documentary
    evidence to support the claim about the proposed business.  It did  not
    accept that the appellant was his business partner and found  that  his
    evidence was to assist the appellant in the appeal and no reliance  was
    placed on it.

7.   However, the panel  accepted  that  the  appellant  had  established  a
    private life in the UK which would be interfered with  by  deportation.
    It went on to consider the question of proportionality referring to the
    threshold giving rise to the duty to deport under s32 of the UK Borders
    Act 2007, a sentence of imprisonment of at  least  twelve  months.   It
    referred to the amended  immigration  rules  as  setting  out  how  the
    government considered the  balance  should  be  struck  when  assessing
    proportionality in a case involving a foreign criminal.

8.   The appellant had been in the UK since 25 April 1989, a large  part  of
    the time being spent illegally.  It found that the appellant  had  been
    in the country without leave for almost 10 of his 17 years'  residence.
    It considered the judge's sentencing remarks in [39] and summarised its
    findings as follows:

         "[40]    This seriousness of the offence was reflected in the three
             years' sentence meted out to the appellant.


         [41] We find a very strong public interest in deportation outweighs
             the appellant's private and family life in the United Kingdom.
              We find that there are no exceptional  circumstances  in  the
             appellant's appeal.  We find that whatever  private  life  the
             appellant has created in the United Kingdom for the most  part
             has been created when the appellant knew that he had no  right
             to live here.  We find that the appellant could not have had a
             reasonable expectation that he could live and build a  private
             life in this country when he knew that a deportation order had
             been served against him and when he had no  leave  to  remain.
             The appellant knew about the deportation order because  of  an
             undated letter addressed to the respondent which gives reasons
             why he should not be deported.


         [42] We find that the appellant has family  contacts  and  cultural
             ties to Algeria.  His mother, brother and cousins live  there.
             His daughter continues her contact  with  her  grandmother  in
             Algeria.   The  appellant  has  visited  Algeria   and   knows
             plantation owners in Algeria who grow dates which are exported
             to the United Kingdom.  The appellant still speaks Arabic.  He
             can therefore continue his business of  exporting  dates  from
             Algeria.  We find that the appellant  can  continue  with  his
             life in that country.


         [43] We have followed the step-by-step approach in Razgar and  find
             that the appellant's removal would  be  proportionate  to  the
             legitimate aim of effective immigration  control,  and,  given
             that  the  appellant  has  been  convicted   of   the   crime,
             proportionate to the  legitimate  aim  of  the  prevention  of
             disorder or crime."


Grounds and Submissions

9.   The grounds refer to the amended immigration rules and argue the  panel
    failed  to  give  them  proper  consideration  when  assessing  whether
    deportation was conducive to the public good.  This was  a  case  which
    would succeed, so  it  is  argued,  under  the  amended  rules  and  in
    particular para 399A(a).  It is then argued that the  panel  materially
    erred in its assessment of article 8 by failing to consider whether the
    appellant was at any risk of re-offending,  failing  to  refer  to  the
    relevant guidelines set out both in European and domestic jurisprudence
    when assessing whether deportation  was  necessary  and  proportionate.
    There had been no proper consideration of the time  which  had  elapsed
    since the appellant's offence, 23 years, the panel mistakenly referring
    in  [37]  to  17  years.   It  had  failed  properly  to  evaluate  the
    relationship between the appellant and his daughter and step-daughters,
    to make any finding on the evidence of the appellant's former  wife  or
    generally to consider the relevant factors in respect of family life.

10.  Finally, it is argued that the  determination  contained  a  number  of
    mistakes of fact.  The appellant had not been released  to  an  unknown
    address from prison but to an address  in  London,  N1.   He  had  been
    subject to electronic tagging at this address between May and  December
    2005 but the respondent had not made contact with him and he then moved
    to another address.  The appellant had not been without leave  for  ten
    years as the panel stated.  As the deportation decision and deportation
    order had not been served on him, he could not be regarded  as  someone
    without leave.

11.  Permission to appeal was granted by the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  the
    following reasons:

         "1.  The appellant seeks permission in time to appeal  against  the
             decision of the First-tier Tribunal panel ... promulgated on 5
             December 2012 whereby  it  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal
             against  the  Secretary  of  State's  decision   to   make   a
             deportation order under s32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007, the
             new Immigration Rules dated 9 July 2012 and  under  article  8
             ECHR.


         2.   In the other ground it is  submitted  that  the  Tribunal  has
             arguably erred in law by (a) misdirecting themselves on  parts
             of the appellant's evidence on which the Tribunal based  their
             findings.  For example at para 37 of the determination  it  is
             recorded that the appellant has been in the UK since 25  April
             1989.  The Tribunal find that the appellant has been in the UK
             for 23 years and (b)  by  failing  to  give  any  findings  on
             material matters, for example it is recorded at para 5 of  the
             determination  that  the  appellant's  ex-wife,   Mrs   Marion
             Faulkner, gave written and oral evidence.   A  record  of  her
             oral evidence is recorded at para  10  of  the  determination.
             However there are no findings in relation to her  evidence  or
             the impact of the appellant's removal on her life (Beoku-Betts
             v SSHD [2008] UKHL 39)."

12.  Ms  Solanki  adopted  the  grounds.   She  submitted  that  although  a
    deportation order operated to invalidate any leave to remain, the order
    would only take effect when it was served.  The appellant had given his
    address to the Probation Service and had been tagged.  He was under  no
    further duty to keep the respondent informed of where  he  was  living.
    It  was  wrong  to  characterise  him  in  these  circumstances  as  an
    absconder.  These factors should have  been  taken  into  account  when
    assessing proportionality.  The Tribunal had given  significant  weight
    to the fact that much of the time the appellant's leave to be in the UK
    had been unlawful when that was not in fact the case.  It had failed to
    make any findings on the evidence given by the appellant's former  wife
    or to deal adequately with the evidence given by Laila  and  his  step-
    daughter, Jessica.  She argued that para 399A  was  applicable  as  the
    appellant had been resident for twenty years at the date of service  of
    the decision and that should have been taken into account.

13.  Mr Nath submitted that there had been proper service  as  the  decision
    was served at the appellant's last known address.  In any event, in the
    circumstances of this appeal whether the appellant's leave  was  lawful
    or unlawful had little relevance to the outcome  of  the  appeal.   The
    evidence of the  witnesses  had  been  adequately  summarised  and  its
    findings of fact made were properly open to the  panel.   The  Tribunal
    had been entitled to take the view that this was a serious  offence  as
    was clear from the judge's sentencing remarks.  The fact there may be a
    low  risk  of  re-offending  was  not  the  end  of  the  matter.   The
    seriousness of the offence had  to  be  considered  together  with  the
    issues of deterrence.

The Error of Law

14.  The issue for me at this stage of the hearing is whether  the  Tribunal
    erred in law such that its decision should be set aside.  When granting
    permission to appeal  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  said  that  the
    deportation decision was made under the UK Borders Act 2007 but this is
    not correct, it was made under the provisions of  the  Immigration  Act
    1971 s5.  The panel recorded this in [1] of its determination and  [15]
    but in [18] cited from MK (Deportation  -  foreign  criminal  -  public
    interest) Gambia [2010] UKUT 281 saying that it  must  take  that  case
    into account but that case  dealt  with  automatic  deportation  orders
    under the 2007 Act.  At the hearing submissions were made to the effect
    that the appellant could bring himself within the  provisions  of  para
    399A, the ground relying on para 399A(a) and arguing that  it  was  not
    considered, seemingly on the basis that the Tribunal  were  working  on
    the assumption that the appellant had only been resident in the UK  for
    17 years as opposed to over 20 years.  I am satisfied that the Tribunal
    erred in law by failing to  consider  the  length  of  the  appellant's
    residence in the UK not only when considering the  amended  immigration
    rules but also more generally when assessing article 8.

15.  The Tribunal referred to the evidence from the appellant's former  wife
    in its summary of the evidence but did not make any  findings  on  that
    evidence or take it into account when assessing proportionality.   That
    evidence  was  at  least  capable  of  affecting  the   assessment   of
    proportionality.

16.  I am also  satisfied  that  a  number  of  relevant  matters  were  not
    properly taken into account as set out in Uner [2006] 45 EHRR  421  and
    Maslov [2007] 47 EHRR 496 including the time which  has  elapsed  since
    the appellant's offence, length of residence in the UK and the evidence
    of the nature and extent of the  continuing  private  and  family  life
    between the appellant, his  daughter,  step-daughters  and  his  former
    wife.

17.  For these reasons I am satisfied that the panel erred in law  and  that
    these errors are capable of affecting the outcome of  the  appeal.   In
    these circumstances the decision should be set aside.  The  appeal  was
    listed for further directions on 2 May 2013  and  the  appeal  was  re-
    listed for the decision to be re-made on 19 June 2013.

Further Evidence

18.  Following a direction made on 2 May 2013, the respondent,  in  response
    to a request from the appellant to serve any evidence that she  had  in
    her  possession  of  contact  with  the  probation  service  after  the
    appellant was released from detention and any evidence  as  to  whether
    the respondent had asked the appellant to stay  in  contact  with  UKBA
    following his release from detention, confirmed in a  letter  dated  13
    June 2013 that enquiries had  not  disclosed  any  such  evidence.   Mr
    McGirr sought to rely on a number  of  further  documents  including  a
    request for information about the appellant's immigration  status  when
    considering whether he might be eligible for removal and a copy of  the
    record on  the  respondent's  computer  system  about  the  appellant's
    whereabouts following his release from prison.  The appellant sought to
    adduce further evidence of a partnership deed between the appellant and
    Mr R Brilis and submitted a skeleton argument  and  extracts  from  the
    UKBA website setting out the rules relating  to  deportation.   I  gave
    permission for this evidence to be admitted.

19.  Ms Solanke objected to the admission of the computer record but in  the
    light of the issues arising from the delay in serving  the  immigration
    decision on the appellant I took the view that it was in the  interests
    of justice for this document to be admitted  but  gave  Ms  Solanke  an
    opportunity of taking instructions from the  appellant  before  hearing
    further evidence.  The record reads as follows:

         "Subject was released from HMP Standford Hill - release address:


         418 The Strand Piccadilly London WC2


         Probation office 1-5 Dorsett Close, London NW1 5AN


         Case was referred to MIG, they confirm that  subject's  last  known
         address was 32 Swathling Close, N18 2QG (according to DWP)


         A visit was made to the address on 9  May  2006  by  Beckett  House
         Arrest Team as part of OP Scully. Subject resides  at  address  but
         was not present at time of visit.


         Call from subject's brother-in-law who declined to  leave  name  or
         number.
         He said subject had called him saying that  he  (the  subject)  had
         been at work when we visited. His flatmate  called  him  about  our
         visit and he then fled to Leeds. Caller agreed to try and  get  the
         subject to come into Beckett Reporting  Centre  after  I  explained
         that  we  needed  to  see  him  about  his  status  following   his
         conviction; the caller had imagined  that  it  was  connected.   He
         claimed that the subject's conviction for credit card fraud was his
         only involvement in criminal activity.


         Caller said he would call back if he succeeded.


         N Gornall


         Beckett Arrest Team


         On 27/2/04 at Southwark Crown Court the subject was  concocted  for
         the offence of conspiracy to defraud and sentenced to three  years'
         imprisonment.


         On 25.09.06 file allocated to Miss A Baugh."


20.  The relevant documentary evidence is set out in the appellant's  bundle
    indexed and paginated A1-88 and the respondent's bundle  R  unpaginated
    but including the record already set out in  [19].   There  is  also  a
    partnership deed between the appellant and Mr R Brilis.  I  heard  oral
    evidence from the appellant, his  former  wife,  Marion  Faulkner,  his
    daughter Laila Aknouche, his  stepdaughter  Natalie  Faulkner  and  his
    business partner Mr R Brilis.

(i)  The Evidence of the Appellant

21.  The appellant adopted his witness statement at A17-22.   This  confirms
    that he entered the UK as a visitor in 1989 with six months'  leave  to
    enter which was extended until April 1990.   In  1995  he  was  granted
    indefinite leave to remain on  the  grounds  of  his  marriage  to  Mrs
    Faulkner, a British national.  They have a daughter Laila and his  wife
    had twin daughters from a  previous  relationship.   They  lived  as  a
    family unit for the next  ten  years.   On  27  February  2004  he  was
    convicted of conspiracy to defraud having been on bail  for  two  years
    and sentenced to three years in prison on  2  April  2004.   He  served
    twelve months in HMP Stamford Hill taking a business and IT course.  On
    20 May 2005 he  was  released  and  was  given  no  conditions  by  the
    respondent nor asked to keep in contact.  Since then he  has  committed
    no further offences.  This had been a difficult period for himself  and
    his family resulting in a separation from his wife followed by  divorce
    in May 2006.  However, amicable relations have been maintained for  the
    sake of the children.  The appellant says that he is  not  a  dishonest
    person but hard working.  He has attempted to rebuild his life and  the
    one thing that made him carry on and be optimistic was the fact that he
    had children waiting for him when he came out of prison.

22.  He was very shocked when he was arrested  and  detained  on  23  August
    2012 and served with the decision dated 15  February  2007  to  make  a
    deportation order.  He remained on good terms with his former wife  and
    was bailed to her address which was very convenient as he  helped  care
    for their daughter,  Laila.   She  suffers  from  a  number  of  health
    complications and has been going through a  very  distressing  physical
    health problem.  He plays a vital  role  in  her  life  supporting  her
    emotionally and financially.  His former wife could not care for her as
    she is trying to cope  with  her  own  health  problems.   He  has  two
    stepchildren, Natalie and Jessica  Faulkner  who  are  twins.   He  has
    regular contact with them as a father.  Natalie now has two children, a
    daughter aged 5 and a son aged 4.  He regularly looks  after  them  and
    they spend a lot of time together.  He is employed as a director  of  a
    company  called  Global  Foods,  paying  tax,  national  insurance  and
    corporation tax.  He has also paid child maintenance for  his  daughter
    and stepdaughters.  The business is likely to expand and they will have
    to recruit new staff members.  He says this is a very exciting time for
    the company and it is vital that he remains in the UK.

23.  In his oral evidence he said that he used  to  live  at  32  Swaythling
    Close after he came out of prison from May 2005 until the end of  2005.
    He was tagged and there was a record of coming in and going out and  he
    had to report to Enfield probation office.  He had  never  reported  to
    the probation office at 1-5 Dorsett Close.  His wife had five  brothers
    but he did not think she had seen them since her mother's funeral  some
    twenty years ago.  His children had never seen them so far  as  he  was
    aware.  He had been working in Canning Town in a hotel.  He  had  never
    been to Leeds.  He had never been asked to report to  the  Home  Office
    after his release from prison and  had  never  been  to  Beckett  House
    Reporting Centre.  He had moved to an address in Private Road,  Enfield
    at the end of 2005 and lived there for one and a half to two years.  He
    then moved back to Potters Bar to his wife as they had  been  suffering
    some harassment and there were a number of problems.  He had moved them
    to another address in Southgate.

24.  He recalled that towards the end of his time in prison  he  had  had  a
    letter from the immigration authorities and had been asked  to  send  a
    copy of his passport and details of whether  he  was  in  this  country
    legally or illegally.  He had sent them his wife's passport and Laila's
    passport but he heard nothing back.  He was referred to the document at
    E1 of the appeal papers but said that he  had  not  seen  this  before.
    This document sets out representations apparently made on his behalf in
    response to  receiving  a  notice  of  intention  to  consider  issuing
    deportation proceedings.  He said that he did not know who prepared the
    document but he had written a signed statement on a piece of paper.  He
    confirmed that his elderly mother lived in Algeria.  He  had  not  seen
    her since 2001 but did call her at Eid and Christmas.  A brother looked
    after his mother and he had another brother living in the USA.

(ii)  The Evidence of Marion Faulkner

25.  Mrs Faulkner adopted her witness statement at A13-16.  She married  the
    appellant in 1993 and they were subsequently divorced in 2004/2005  but
    they  still  maintain  a  good  relationship.   In  her  statement  she
    describes  the  appellant  as  a  wonderful  stepfather  to  her   twin
    daughters, Natalie and Jessica and he helped her raise  them  from  the
    age of 5.  When he was arrested and sent to prison she  was  completely
    shocked as she knew what a good person he was.  When he was released he
    continued to abide by the rules for his  probation  which  demonstrated
    his compliance and  reliability.   She  suffers  from  physical  health
    problems.  She has been diagnosed with arthritis, high  blood  pressure
    and a stomach hernia which really affects her day-to-day life.  She  is
    in constant pain with arthritis and finds it difficult  to  walk,  pick
    things up and carry out chores and strenuous or demanding tasks.

26.  Her daughter Laila  also  suffers  from  a  very  distressing  physical
    problem which is ongoing and has left her  very  emotionally  unstable.
    Because of her  health  problems  she  is  unable  to  care  for  Laila
    optimally and the appellant has been her rock  through  this  difficult
    time.  In addition he plays a valuable role in Laila's religious  life.
    She is an atheist and  cannot  meet  Laila's  religious  needs  as  she
    practises Islam.  She says that the appellant plays a vital role  in  a
    number of people's lives and most importantly in his  daughter  Laila's
    life.  She would be emotionally devastated,  religiously  deprived  and
    psychologically damaged if he had to leave.

27.  In her oral evidence she confirmed that she has five brothers  but  she
    last saw them at her mother's funeral.   She  said  that  her  brothers
    would not have heard from the appellant.  When  he  was  released  from
    prison, he came to visit and she asked him where he was staying but she
    could not now remember the address.  She did not  know  of  him  living
    outside London and said that he had never lived in Leeds.  She had kept
    in touch with him and he had come to see his daughters.  She  confirmed
    that Laila's health was better than it was but she was still continuing
    to suffer from problems.  The appellant did odd jobs for her, gardening
    and shopping, as she could not do anything.  In September 2012  he  had
    been bailed to her address.

28.  In cross-examination she was asked about para 3 of her statement  where
    she said that the appellant had not committed the crime of which he was
    accused.  She said that he had told her that he had  not  done  it  and
    there had been nothing to suggest that he was acting differently.   She
    said that she knew nothing about the �12,500 in  cash  which  had  been
    found in the house.  That had been kept from her.  She thought  he  had
    lived in Edmonton when he came out of prison  but  she  did  not  visit
    there.  He had asked if he could stay with her but at  that  stage  she
    said no.  She could not remember where he moved to  when  his  tag  was
    removed but did remember that he went to  Enfield,  then  Southgate  or
    Potters Bar.  There was no reason why her brothers would wish  him  any
    harm and they would not know anything about what was going on.

(iii)  The Evidence of Laila Aknouche

29.  Ms Aknouche adopted her witness statement  at  A9-12.   There  were  no
    further questions and  no  cross-examination.   In  her  statement  she
    confirms that the appellant is her father and he  has  brought  her  up
    from birth.  She explains about her health,  how  she  has  experienced
    bouts of vomiting and severe diarrhoea which  have  led  to  her  being
    hospitalised a few times with the health professionals not knowing  the
    cause.  Following this she experienced a large amount of internal blood
    loss and it was speculated that she might have  Crohn's  disease.   She
    has had a number of appointments at the  hospital  and  with  a  doctor
    which she could not have attended without her  father's  support.   The
    colonoscopy came back clear but she is still  experiencing  blood  loss
    and pain and her consultant does not know what is causing this.

30.  She says that her mother cannot manage to look after  herself  properly
    and struggles to look after her.  Her father's role is important as  he
    looks after her mother and her to the best of  his  ability.   She  had
    fond memories of her father when she was growing up and also remembered
    how her sisters Jessica and Natalie used to play games together.  Since
    his release from prison in May 2005, her life has returned to  the  way
    it was before.  When her father was detained on 23 August 2012, she was
    very negatively affected by his detention and went into complete shock.
     She followed Islam and had been encouraged by  her  father,  whom  she
    described as a brilliant role model.  If he were  to  be  deported,  it
    would greatly affect her family life.  She would follow him to  Algeria
    if he was made to leave the United Kingdom.  She had never been  abroad
    before and the prospect of living  in  an  entirely  different  country
    scared her but she could not be apart from him.  Her father has  no-one
    in Algeria, his life was in this country and so was hers as was that of
    the family.

(iv)  The Evidence of Natalie Faulkner

31.  Natalie Faulkner's evidence is set out at A5-8.  The appellant  is  her
    stepfather and she has known him since she was 5 years  old.   She  and
    her twin sister had relied on his support and wisdom.   When  she  left
    her mother's home many years ago, the support  she  received  from  the
    appellant continued.  They saw each other regularly.  He had bought her
    a laptop so that she could complete her college work as her goal was to
    become a radiographer.  Since being released from prison in  May  2005,
    the appellant has continued to be the respectful and caring  person  he
    had always been.  Her children were born  in  2007  and  2008  and  the
    appellant had always behaved as their grandfather.  Her children  loved
    him very much and would be devastated if his deportation order was  not
    retracted.  She had acted as a surety and  her  family  life  would  be
    greatly affected if he had to return to Algeria.

32.  In her  oral  evidence  she  confirmed  that  she  had  never  met  her
    biological father and had effectively been brought up by her mother and
    the appellant.  She was a single parent as she was separated  from  her
    children's father.  She  was  now  studying  at  college  and  near  to
    completing her course.  She had the offer  of  a  university  place  in
    September.  She lived close to her mother  and  the  children  saw  the
    appellant regularly.   She  was  really  worried  that  they  would  be
    psychologically affected if they lost contact with him.

33.  In cross-examination she said that when the appellant left  prison  she
    was then about 15.  She knew he used to live in Edmonton when he had  a
    tag.  She then came back to their address as they  needed  his  support
    because they had a number of problems.  She had  met  his  mother  once
    when she visited from Algeria but that was when she was  really  young,
    of primary school age.


(v)  The Evidence of Mr R Brilis

34.  Mr Brilis confirmed the contents of his  statement  dated  15  November
    2012 at A71.  He met the  appellant  in  2005  after  being  introduced
    through a friend and later they became friends  themselves.   They  had
    stayed in touch working together  in  2009  and  later  that  year  the
    appellant approached him with  an  opportunity  to  work  with  a  date
    supplier in Algeria and they went into business together.  The business
    imports dates and date paste from Algeria used in whole fruit bars sold
    in the UK's major supermarkets.  The appellant deals  with  the  supply
    side  communications  and  handles  all  of  the  inbound  freight  and
    deliveries.  They had been working with a bodybuilder  to  develop  two
    new products aimed at the fitness industry, a high protein bread and  a
    high protein pasta.  The appellant has been invaluable in creating  the
    recipes.  He keeps in regular contact with his daughter.

35.  In his oral evidence he said the appellant  had  been  open  about  his
    offences which had not been a secret and they had  had  a  conversation
    about it.  He understood it related to a fraud when he was  working  in
    the restaurant business.  However, he believed that he was a good judge
    of character and this was borne out by the success of  their  business.
    Their turnover was now about �600,000 a  year.   There  were  no  other
    employees at present but they were  now  advertising  for  a  marketing
    assistant.  He confirmed that the appellant dealt with the supply  side
    for dates from Tunisia and Algeria.  The products they  were  producing
    were being made in France.  He said it  would  be  devastating  if  the
    appellant could not work as a partner.

36.   In  cross-examination  he  confirmed  that  the  appellant  did  speak
    regularly on the phone to his daughter.  He would not be able to  carry
    out his duties to the business from abroad.

(vi)  Witness Statement of Jessica Faulkner

37.  This witness was not able to attend because  of  work  commitments  but
    reliance was placed on her statement at A1-4.  This confirms  that  the
    appellant brought her and her twin  Natalie  up  from  the  age  of  5.
    Natalie's children adored him  and  saw  him  as  a  grandfather.   His
    detention in August 2012 came as a massive shock.   She  describes  the
    appellant as a very well respected and law abiding citizen saying  that
    after being released from prison for a crime he did not commit, he  has
    not committed any other crime but has reintegrated  himself  back  into
    society by complying with and  respecting  the  UK's  laws.   It  would
    greatly affect their family life if he were to be deported.

Submissions

38.  Mr McGirr relied on the reasons  for  refusal  letter  of  18  February
    2007.  He accepted that the appellant had at  least  a  strong  private
    life in the UK but the strength of the bond with  his  family  did  not
    outweigh the seriousness of the offence.  His  position  could  not  be
    described as exceptional.  His  daughters  were  adults.   The  unusual
    features of the case such as his daughter's  health  problems  and  the
    childcare and assistance he gave to his stepdaughters and grandchildren
    were not sufficient to make  the  case  exceptional,  neither  was  the
    length of his residence.  He was not able to meet the  requirements  of
    para 398 or 399A as he had not lived continuously in the UK for  twenty
    years immediately preceding the date of the immigration decision and in
    any event he was not someone who had no ties whether  social,  cultural
    or family with Algeria.

39.  Ms Solanke adopted her  skeleton  argument.   She  submitted  that  the
    appellant did come within the provisions of para 399A as  the  date  of
    the immigration decision should be treated as the date of service.  She
    relied on R (ex parte  Anufrijyeva)  [2003]  UKHL  36  to  support  her
    submission that 31 August 2012 was the relevant date of  service.   The
    appellant had only returned once to Algeria and this was for a  funeral
    in 2001.  Taking into account the guidance in Ogundimu (article 8 - new
    rules)  Nigeria  [2013]  UKUT  60,  the  appellant  did  not  have  any
    connection to life in Algeria and making a rounded  assessment  of  all
    the circumstances, he could not be said to have  any  social,  cultural
    and family ties.  She submitted that the appeal should  be  allowed  on
    article 8 grounds in any event, referring to MF (article 8 - new rules)
    Nigeria [2012] UKUT 393.  She referred to the criteria set out in  Uner
    v the Netherlands [2007] 45 EHRR 14, in Maslov v Austria  1638/2003  23
    June 2008 and in Sanade and  Others  (British  children  -  Zambrano  -
    Dereci) [2012] UKUT 0048.  She submitted that  the  appellant's  appeal
    should be allowed against the decision to make a deportation order  and
    further that the deportation order also served on 31  August  2012  was
    unlawful and therefore  a  nullity  as  it  had  been  made  while  the
    appellant had an appeal pending against the decision to make an  order:
    s.79(1)(a) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

Assessment of the Issues

40.  The decision to make a deportation order was made under the  provisions
    of s.3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971 and is dated 15 February 2007.
     The appellant had previously been served on 31 March 2005 with  notice
    of a person liable for deportation and he subsequently replied  setting
    out in  document  E1  the  reasons  why  he  should  not  be  deported.
    According to the immigration history set out in the appeal  papers  the
    appellant was released from  prison  on  20  May  2005  to  an  unknown
    address.   Subsequent  checks  obtained  what  was  believed  to  be  a
    permanent address but an enforcement visit did not yield any result and
    he was listed as an absconder.  Evidence has been produced in a  record
    dated 1 May 2006 of what  is  recorded  on  the  respondent's  computer
    system about the enquiries that were made.  The deportation  order  was
    made on 28 August 2007.  The appellant only came to  the  attention  of
    the authorities on 22 August 2012 when he was arrested and he was  then
    served with the decision to make a deportation  order  and  the  signed
    deportation order on 31 August 2012.  He gave notice of  appeal  on  13
    September 2012.

41.  I am satisfied that by reason of  the  provisions  of  the  Immigration
    (Notices) Regulations 2003 that the  decision  to  make  a  deportation
    order, which is an immigration decision within s.82 of  the  2002  Act,
    was served in accordance with the provisions of reg 7(2).   Ms  Solanke
    relies on the opinions of the House of Lords in R (ex parte Anufrijeva)
    but that sets out the general principles relating to  service  but  the
    2003  Regulations  make  statutory  provision  for  giving  notice   of
    immigration decisions.  Notice of  an  immigration  decision  shall  be
    deemed to have been given in cases where the requirements  of  reg  7.2
    are met when the decision maker enters a record  of  the  circumstances
    and places the notice on the relevant file.  The  decision  is  in  the
    present case is properly regarded as given on 29 June 2007.

42.  The appellant has sought to rely on the provisions of para 399A  of  HC
    395 as amended.  The provisions relating to deportation and  Article  8
    in the amended Immigration Rules are at paras 398-400.   The  appellant
    falls within the provisions of para 398(b) as he has been convicted  of
    an offence for which he has been sentenced to a  period  of  less  than
    four years but at least twelve months.   This enables him  to  rely  on
    para 399 or 399A but if those provisions do not apply, it will only  be
    in exceptional circumstances that the public  interest  in  deportation
    will be outweighed by other factors.  The provisions of para 399A apply
    if:

         "(a) The person has lived continuously  in  the  UK  for  at  least
             twenty years immediately preceding the date of the immigration
             decision (discounting any period of imprisonment) and  he  has
             no ties  (including  social,  cultural  or  family)  with  the
             country to which he would have to go if required to leave  the
             UK ..."

43.  It is argued that the  date  of  the  immigration  decision  should  be
    treated as the date when the decisions were served on him on 31  August
    2012 and that the appellant at that stage had lived in the  UK  for  23
    years.  I am not satisfied that this is the case.  The wording  of  the
    rule specifically refers to the date of the immigration decision  which
    was 15 February 2007 and in any event notice has been given  under  reg
    7(2) of 2003 Regulations.   I  am  therefore  not  satisfied  that  the
    appellant is able to show twenty years' continuous residence within the
    provisions of para 399A.

44.  I am also not satisfied that he is able to show that  he  has  no  ties
    including social, cultural or family  ties  with  Algeria.   He  has  a
    mother and brother still  living  there  and  the  evidence  about  his
    business is that he is involved in importing dates from Algeria.   This
    is not a case where it can be said that has not ties  to  Algeria.   He
    therefore does have a connection to life in  that  country  within  the
    guidance set out in Ogundimu.   In that  case  it  was  held  that  the
    natural and ordinary meaning of the word "ties" in  para  399A  of  the
    Immigration Rules imported a  concept  involving  something  more  than
    really remote or abstract ties to the country of proposed  deportation.
    It involved there being a connection to life in  that  country.   There
    should be a rounded assessment of all the relevant circumstances  which
    were not to be limited to "social, cultural and family"  circumstances.
    I am not satisfied therefore that the appellant's  appeal  can  succeed
    under the provisions of the Immigration Rules.

45.  In considering whether I should go on to  continue  the  principles  of
    Article 8 generally I have taken  into  account  the  judgment  of  the
    Administrative Court in Nagre v Secretary of State [2013] EWHC 720  and
    the guidance of the Upper Tribunal in Izuazu [2013] UKUT 45  and  Green
    [2013] UKUT 254 and I am satisfied that this is an appropriate case  to
    move on to consider  the  position  under  Article  8  apart  from  the
    provisions of the Immigration Rules.  As the appellant cannot  rely  on
    para 399A, he can only succeed under the rules if he is  able  to  show
    exceptional  circumstances  outweighing  the  public  interest  in  his
    deportation.  This test reflects the requirements of  the  rules  which
    were in force when the decision was made which provided under para  364
    that the presumption  should  be  that  the  public  interest  required
    deportation and that the respondent would consider all relevant factors
    in considering whether the presumption was outweighed in any particular
    case although it would only be in exceptional  circumstances  that  the
    public interest in deportation would be outweighed in a  case  when  it
    would not be contrary to the Human Rights Convention.  I  am  satisfied
    that this a case where all the relevant issues involved in the  article
    8 assessment are not adequately covered by the rules.

46.  When assessing whether there is a breach of article 8 I must take  into
    account the step-by-step approach set out by  Lord  Bingham  in  Razgar
    [2004] UKHL 27.  I  am  satisfied  that  private  and  family  life  is
    established in the present case.  The appellant does  not  have  family
    life with his former wife although I accept that he is  on  good  terms
    with her and plays a part in looking after her and doing work for  her.
    He is also on good terms with his daughter and  his  two  stepdaughters
    but they are over 21 so far as  his  stepdaughters  are  concerned  and
    Laila is 18.  Ms Solanke reminds me that under the  EEA  Regulations  a
    child is considered to be a minor until the age of 21.  Nonetheless,  I
    must follow the guidance in Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ  31  in  assessing
    whether there is family life and whether there is  anything  more  than
    the normal level of emotional dependency.

47.  I treat the evidence of the appellant's family with some caution as  it
    is inevitably coloured by their desire that he should not  be  deported
    but also by the belief that he is innocent of the offence of  which  he
    was convicted.  I accept that there is a private life arising both from
    the length of the appellant's residence and his continuing close  links
    with his family and his  daughters  and  step  grandchildren.   I  also
    accept that the appellant does play a continuing role in  the  life  of
    his daughters, stepdaughters and grandchildren and that family life  is
    not cut off at the age of majority.  Looking at the position as a whole
    I am satisfied that there is not only  private  but  also  family  life
    which will be affected by his deportation.  I am  also  satisfied  that
    the interference by deportation would be such as to engage  article  8,
    that the decision is in accordance with the law  and  that  deportation
    would be for a legitimate aim.

48.   I  must  then  take  into  account  the  issues  identified  in  ECtHR
    authorities of Uner and Maslov.  This was a serious offence  of  fraud.
    The appellant was employed  as  an  assistant  manager  in  an  Italian
    restaurant and the details of credit cards were copied on to a  skimmer
    and then encoded on to bogus or cloned cards for fraudulent use.   When
    police officers attended the restaurant they found the skimmer  in  the
    jacket pocket of the appellant.  There were some 49 card numbers in the
    memory.  The total amount of fraudulent use of  the  cards  cloned  was
    some �30,000 to �40,000.  The appellant had  over  �12,000  cash  in  a
    briefcase at home as well as �6,000 on  his  person.   He  pleaded  not
    guilty to the offence but was convicted by a jury.  In  his  sentencing
    remarks, the judge said:

         "To some extent this was a breach of trust against your employer in
         that you were not carrying out your duties honestly.   But  on  the
         other hand, it is right to say that your employer was not  a  loser
         here.  The losers are the banks issuing and  operating  the  credit
         cards in question.  There must also have been inconvenience to  the
         credit card holders whose cards of course would have been  returned
         to them perfectly properly, when it was discovered  that  they  had
         been debited for things that had no relation to them and  were  the
         result of fraudulent misuse of a cloned card.

         In one respect this was, in my view a mean fraud.  This was a small
         business.  Mrs W was part owner with  her  husband.   She  actually
         worked alongside you in the business and there were few  staff  and
         suspicion would inevitably fall on anybody who had been working  at
         the material time.


         Credit card fraud in whatever  form  is  all  too  common.   It  is
         lucrative.  It is relatively easy to  execute.   This  was  a  well
         planned and equipped operation.  I accept of course that others  as
         well as yourself were involved; for example, in the cloning of  the
         false cards.  But the fact is  that  you  were  in  a  position  of
         responsibility and you played an essential role in this fraud.   In
         my view your motivation could only be sheer greed."

49.  The judge took  into  account  the  fact  that  the  appellant  had  no
    previous convictions and had worked hard in this country but he had not
    accepted responsibility for his offence.  There was no credit  for  any
    guilty plea or consequential expression  of  remorse.   A  compensation
    order was made in the sum of �13,000 and the judge passed a sentence of
    three years' imprisonment.

50.  The appellant arrived in the UK in  1989.   He  had  leave  to  remain.
    There was a period where he overstayed but subsequently he married  and
    was granted limited leave and then indefinite leave to remain.  He  has
    continued to reside in this country save for one brief visit to Algeria
    many years ago.  Since the offence was committed he has remained out of
    trouble and continued his family life.   He  is  an  Algerian  national
    whereas his former wife and  his  children  have  British  nationality.
    There has been no evidence as to whether Laila  would  be  entitled  to
    Algerian nationality as the appellant is her father.  The appellant  is
    no longer married but is on good terms with his former wife.  He  plays
    a  continuing  part  in  the  life  of  his  daughters  and  his  step-
    grandchildren.  His daughter is now 18 and his stepchildren  about  25.
    No issue arises of whether his former wife should go  to  Algeria.   So
    far as  his  daughter  and  stepdaughters  are  concerned  they  cannot
    reasonably be expected to move to Algeria.  This is not  a  case  where
    deporting the appellant  inhibits  in  any  way  the  exercise  of  his
    family's rights as EU citizens. In her  witness  statement  Laila  says
    that she would follow her father to Algeria  but  she  also  makes  the
    point that the family would be torn apart if that happened.  As I  have
    already indicated their evidence is coloured  by  their  understandable
    wish that the appellant should not be deported and  I  find  that  they
    have exaggerated the extent of the impact on their family life.  Whilst
    he does have normal emotional ties with his family, I am not  satisfied
    that they can be described as exceptional.

51.  I must  take  into  account  the  interests  of  the  appellant's  step
    grandchildren as a primary consideration.  I  accept  that  they  would
    miss  the  appellant  but  I  do  not  accept  that   they   would   be
    psychologically damaged to the extent argued  by  their  mother  beyond
    missing direct contact.  The appellant's social,  cultural  and  family
    ties are now with this country and his ties with Algeria are much  more
    limited but as I have already indicated such ties  exist.   His  mother
    and brother continue to live in Algeria and he has business links  with
    the country.  I accept that the appellant is in business but I  do  not
    accept that the impact of deportation would be  as  devastating  as  Mr
    Brilis has claimed.  He would not be able to work as a partner in  this
    country but there appears to be no reason why  he  could  not  have  an
    input into the business from Algeria.

52.  The other important factor I must take into account is  the  extent  of
    the delay in the matter coming to appeal.  The delay was caused by  the
    fact that the decision could not be personally served on the  appellant
    until 2012.  Whilst I am satisfied  that  the  computer  record  is  an
    accurate record of what is recorded on the respondent's computer  about
    the enquiries made to try and locate the appellant after  the  decision
    was made, I have concerns about the accuracy of some of the information
    itself.  There is no dispute that after he was released from prison the
    appellant lived at 32 Swaythling Close during the period  when  he  was
    tagged.  I accept that he left there by the end of 2005 and that he was
    not living there  in  2006  and  I  attach  no  weight  to  information
    purporting to come from a flatmate. However, I see no reason  to  doubt
    the record that there was a call from the appellant's brother-in-law or
    someone claiming to be so who had knowledge of the  appellant'  offence
    and said that he would try and get the appellant to come  into  Beckett
    Reporting Centre.

53.  I find it hard to accept that the appellant  or  some  members  of  his
    family would not have known about this. There must be at least a strong
    possibility that the  appellant  knew  the  respondent  was  trying  to
    contact him but he chose to  wait  and  see  whether  or  when  he  was
    located.  There is no doubt that  the  appellant  was  aware  that  the
    respondent was considering making a deportation order having sought his
    submissions in March 2005. The appellant responded to a question  about
    the letter appearing at E1 saying that he had not  seen  this  document
    but it must have been drafted on the basis of information  he  provided
    and was quite specifically aimed at the issue of whether he  should  be
    deported.  I take into account that there was a delay by the respondent
    in taking the decision to make a  deportation  order.   The  subsequent
    delay before the decision was personally served on him arose  from  the
    respondent not being able to locate the appellant. I have had  concerns
    about whether the appellant took  steps  deliberately  to  evade  being
    located but the evidence is not sufficiently strong for me to make such
    a finding on a balance of probabilities.  The appellant was aware  that
    the respondent was considering making a deportation order but I am  not
    satisfied that he took positive steps to frustrate enforcement  of  the
    decision not least as it is conceded that there is no evidence  of  any
    requirements imposed by the respondent with which he failed to  comply.



54.  I am therefore satisfied that the respondent did make enquiries  in  an
    attempt to locate the appellant which were unsuccessful.   No  evidence
    has been provided to show that the appellant was under  any  obligation
    to remain in contact with the respondent before any decision  was  made
    but equally I  am  satisfied  that  the  appellant  was  aware  of  the
    possibility of a deportation order and did not bring himself  to  their
    attention.  Even so, I must take into account the lapse of time between
    the decision in 2007 and the appellant coming to light in 2012 as  part
    of his length of residence and as arising from the delay in being  able
    to serve the notice on him.  I do not attach any weight to whether  his
    residence has been lawful or  unlawful  following  the  making  of  the
    deportation order which would invalidate his leave to remain by  virtue
    of s.5(1) if the 1971 Act. The issue of the validity of that order  has
    been raised in these proceedings on the basis that it is a  nullity  as
    it was made when an appeal could be brought but I am not satisfied that
    this is the case as it was made after the expiry of the permitted  time
    in which an appeal could be brought following service.

55.  In EB (Kosovo) [2008] ImmAR 713 the  House  of  Lords  said  the  delay
    could be relevant in any one of three ways: firstly, during a period of
    delay a claimant might develop closer personal and social ties  and  so
    establish deeper roots in the  community,  secondly,  any  relationship
    entered into which was precarious might have strengthened with time and
    thirdly, if delay was shown to be the result of a dysfunctional  system
    that yielded unpredictable, inconsistent and unfair outcomes  it  could
    be relevant to reducing the weight to be attached to  the  requirements
    of firm and fair immigration control.

56.  I am not satisfied that the delay  here  occurred  as  a  result  of  a
    dysfunctional system leading to inconsistent and unfair  outcomes.   It
    occurred to a large extent because the respondent was unable to  locate
    the appellant.  Further, the legitimate aim in this appeal is  not  the
    requirement of  firm  and  fair  immigration  control  but  the  public
    interest  in  deporting  those  who  commit  serious  offences.   I  am
    satisfied that  the  appellant's  deportation  would  have  been  found
    conducive to the public good even prior to the UK Borders Act 2007  and
    the provisions of para 398 of the amended rules.

57.  I take into account that the appellant has had no  further  convictions
    and has complied with the terms of his licence.   Whilst  there  was  a
    delay in taking enforcement action, I am satisfied that the  respondent
    did take steps in attempting to locate the  appellant.   The  delay  in
    locating the appellant has had two effects.  The first is that  he  has
    been able to remain in the UK whilst Laila was a  minor  and  when  his
    stepdaughters were young adults and to  this  extent  the  interference
    with his family life is less than it would have been but on  the  other
    hand he has maintained  and  confirmed  his  family  and  private  life
    commitments and built up a relationship with his grandchildren.

58.  However, I must give weight to  the  factors  relating  to  the  public
    interest set out in cases such as OH  (Serbia)  v  Secretary  of  State
    [2008] EWCA Civ 694  including the risk of re-offending, which I accept
    is negligible in the present case, the need to deter foreign  criminals
    by making it clear that one consequence may well be deportation and  to
    reflect society's expression of outrage at the  commission  of  certain
    types of offence and in building public confidence in the treatment  of
    foreign citizens who  have  committed  serious  crimes.   I  must  also
    consider and take into account and give proper weight to the  views  of
    Parliament in the UK Borders Act 2007 and of the Secretary of State and
    the House of Commons in  the  provisions  of  the  amended  immigration
    rules.  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  is  able  to  show
    exceptional circumstances within the immigration rules to outweigh  the
    public  interest  in  deportation.   Although  there  is  no  test   of
    exceptionality  when  article  8  is  looked  at  outside  the   rules,
    nonetheless Lord Bingham made it clear in Razgar [2004] UKHL 24 at [20]
    that it would only be in a small number of cases identifiable on a case
    by case basis that removal would  not  be  appropriate  in  immigration
    cases.  That observation must apply  with  even  more  force  to  cases
    involving the commission of serious criminal offences.

59.  In summary, the appellant  cannot  bring  himself  within  the  amended
    immigration rules as falling in one of the categories where deportation
    would not be the proper course and  I  am  satisfied  that  the  public
    interest outweighs the interference to his private and family life even
    taking into account  the  delay  and  the  personal  and  compassionate
    circumstances relating to the appellant, his family  and  his  business
    and that deportation is necessary and proportionate to a legitimate aim
    within article 8(2).

Decision

60.  The First-tier Tribunal erred in law and  the  decision  has  been  set
    aside.   I  substitute  a  decision  dismissing  this  appeal  on  both
    immigration and human rights grounds.
