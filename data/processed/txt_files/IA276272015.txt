For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the appellant's appeal against the  decision  of  Judge  Khawar
    made following a hearing at Taylor House on 3rd November 2016.



Background

 2.  The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 9th July 1989.

 3. On 23rd July 2015 the Secretary of State refused  his  application  for
    leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student  Migrant  under
    the points-based  system  by  reference  to  paragraph  322(2)  of  the
    Immigration Rules on the basis that in a previous  application  he  had
    submitted false documents.  In particular the respondent relied upon  a
    false English language certificate (TOEIC test certificates) undertaken
    by the appellant on 5th December 2012  and  18th  December  2012.   The
    respondent  maintained  that  the  certificates  were  false  documents
    because the appellant  had  used  a  proxy  test  sitter  and  did  not
    personally achieve the  English  language  scores  recorded.   He  also
    refused the application because the appellant's CAS was  invalid  since
    the appellant's proposed college of study was not listed as  a  Tier  4
    Sponsor as at the date of decision.

 4. The judge recorded that the matter was listed as an  oral  hearing  but
    the appellant did not attend.  He  noted  that  he  had  been  properly
    served with notice of hearing which had been sent  to  his  last  known
    address on 30th July 2016 which  had  been  returned  to  the  Tribunal
    marked "Return to Sender No Longer at this Address".

 5. The judge wrote as follows:

         "The appellant has failed to communicate either with the respondent
         or the Tribunal any change of  address  and  consequently  must  be
         deemed to be unlawfully at large.  The court records show that  the
         appellant's appeal was adjourned from 27th June 2016  when  he  did
         attend.  On that occasion he sought an adjournment because of  late
         service of new evidence by  the  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer.
         Failure to communicate either with the respondent or  the  Tribunal
         change of address implicitly indicates a lack of intention  on  the
         part of the appellant to progress his appeal.  Therefore I deem  it
         appropriate to consider this appeal on the basis of the documentary
         evidence filed by both parties."

 6. The judge then summarised the appellant's immigration history.  So  far
    as the issue of deception was concerned he  said  that  the  burden  of
    proof in relation to dishonesty/deception  allegedly  deployed  by  the
    appellant in using a proxy test sitter was squarely on the  respondent.



 7. The respondent  had  served  generic  witness  statements  and  further
    evidence in the form of an expert report from  Professor  Peter  Finch.
    There was also a report entitled "Project  Faï¿½ade  -  Criminal  Enquiry
    into Abuse of the TOEIC at Stanford College London" dated 15th May 2015
    which reveals  the  very  substantial  extent  of  abuse  prevalent  at
    Stanford College, in that out of 1446 TOEIC speaking and writing tests,
    843 were found to be invalid and 603 were  found  to  be  questionable.
    The appellant's speaking  and  writing  tests  fall  into  the  invalid
    category.   He  was  therefore  satisfied  that  the   respondent   had
    established a prime facie case of deception and  the  burden  of  proof
    therefore  essentially  shifts  to  the  appellant  to   provide   some
    explanation.

 8. He had failed to attend his appeal.  He had provided a graduate diploma
    certificate in business administration but it was obtained in 2014, two
    years after the TOEIC test in 2012. His secondary school  certificates,
    intermediate school certificates,  international  college  certificate,
    IELTS certificate and ACCA exam transcripts all predate the tests,  but
    the standard of English language attained  by  him  cannot,  the  judge
    said, simply be assumed to be at the high standard required for  higher
    studies.

 9. The  judge then wrote:

         "It is also noteworthy that the appellant has now filed (in support
         of his appeal) a Pearson English Language Test undertaken  on  28th
         May 2014.  A comparison of the scores he achieved in this  test  in
         relation to listening, reading, speaking and writing reveals scores
         of the order of 54 to 58%, which are considerably  lower  than  the
         scores he allegedly achieved in December 2012 (of the order of  90%
         plus) as evidence from the TOEIC test scores.  What this in  effect
         means is that two years after the event of allegedly  having  taken
         personally the TOEIC tests the appellant's ability  has  diminished
         by approximately 50%.   In  my  judgment  this  comparison  of  the
         Pearson test scores obtained in May 2014 with the TOEIC  scores  he
         allegedly achieved in 2012 also points to the inevitable conclusion
         that the appellant used a proxy test sitter in 2012."

10. On that basis he dismissed the appeal.

The grounds of application.

11. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had erred in law because the notice of hearing was not served upon him.
     The Tribunal was aware that it had been returned.  The  judge  assumed
    that the appellant had moved address and not notified the Tribunal  and
    had intended to take  no  part  in  the  proceedings  which  were  both
    erroneous.  He had not moved and he  did  intend  to  take  part.   The
    question was not whether the judge was at fault but rather whether  his
    proceeding in these circumstances had resulted in unfairness.   It  was
    argued that the judge was wrong in law in upholding  the  Secretary  of
    State's submission that the appellant had employed deception  based  on
    the witness statements.

12. Permission to appeal was refused by Judge Kelly on 16th May 2017.

13. The appellant then made a further application to the Upper Tribunal and
    was granted permission on  12th  July  2017  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    McWilliam.

Submissions

14. Mr Youssefian relied on his grounds.  He said that  the  appellant  had
    produced an email address when he  had  filled  in  his  appeal  papers
    online, and could also produce evidence that he had not in fact  moved,
    and he had no explanation  as  to  why  the  hearing  notice  had  been
    returned.

15. He submitted that the judge had not properly applied  Rule  28  of  the
    Procedure Rules which required him to consider whether it  was  in  the
    interests of justice to proceed.  He accepted that it  was  the  normal
    procedure of the Tribunal to serve the notice of hearing by  post  but,
    it having been returned, there was an obligation  on  the  Tribunal  to
    consider whether further steps should be taken to notify the  appellant
    of the hearing.  His email address was available.  He  had  attended  a
    previous hearing.  It would therefore have been clear to  the  Tribunal
    that he intended to take  part  in  the  appeal  process.  This  was  a
    litigant in person and  the  seriousness  of  a  finding  of  deception
    against him would have catastrophic consequences for him in the future.
     He had been deprived of his right to a fair hearing since he  had  not
    been able to advance his case.

16. Furthermore the judge had failed to make any reference to the ETS  look
    up tool referring to the appellant.  The evidence which he was  relying
    on was truly generic.

17. Mr Melvin defended the determination.  It was not for the  Tribunal  to
    chase the appellant up by email or telephone providing  the  notice  of
    hearing had been properly served.  It was  clear  that  the  judge  had
    looked at all to the evidence holistically and  come  to  a  conclusion
    which was open to him.

Findings and Conclusions

18. There is in the file an envelope clearly  marked  "No  Longer  at  this
    Address Return to Sender" with the return address HMCTS, PO  Box  7866,
    Loughborough, UK.  It contained the hearing notice which  is  addressed
    to the appellant's last known address and where he  maintains  that  he
    has resided at all relevant times.

19. The fact that the Tribunal may also have had on file an  email  address
    for the appellant by no means establishes that the judge erred  in  law
    in proceeding to determine the appeal in the appellant's absence on the
    basis that he had been properly served with notice, in accordance  with
    the Procedure Rules.  The document was clearly  sent  by  post  to  his
    address.

20. Whilst it would have been open to the judge to  seek  to  make  further
    enquiry he had no obligation to do so.  There was no  mobile  telephone
    number on the file.  Trawling through the papers in order  to  discover
    whether there was an email address is well beyond what could have  been
    reasonably expected of the judge.

21. Neither was there any obligation upon him to set out in terms  that  he
    had considered whether the interests of justice required him to proceed
    in the appellant's absence.  He did not use that phrase in  terms,  but
    he did take into account all relevant factors at  paragraph  7  of  the
    determination including the fact that the appellant had attended  on  a
    previous occasion.

22. On the evidence before him he was plainly entitled to conclude that the
    appellant had failed to communicate a change of address  and  to  infer
    from the return of the hearing notice that he had  little  interest  in
    pursuing his appeal.  There were clear public  interest  considerations
    in proceeding, not least the waste of money to the taxpayer  caused  by
    unnecessary adjournments.

23. It cannot properly be said that there was any procedural impropriety in
    this case.

24. So far as the merits are concerned Mr  Youseffian  initially  submitted
    that the ETS look up tool was missing from the documents  but  when  Mr
    Melvin pointed out that it was there simply maintained that  the  judge
    had not referred to it.  The judge was not obliged to refer to each and
    every document.  The data was in the  papers  before  him  and  clearly
    records the appellant's test results as being invalid.

25. Moreover the  judge  makes  the  entirely  reasonable  point  that  the
    appellant himself produced evidence showing that his recent test scores
    were well below  those  obtained  in  the  disputed  2012  ones,  which
    suggests that the tests he took two years earlier  were  not  taken  by
    him.

Notice of Decision

The  original  judge  did  not  err  in  law.   The  decision  stands.   The
appellant's appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
