For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the appellant whose date of birth  is  [  ]  1953.
    She  is a national from Mauritius.  She appeals against a decision made
    by the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Stott) promulgated  on  25  September
    2015 dismissing her application for leave to remain on immigration  and
    human rights grounds.

2.   The First-tier Tribunal  (FTT)  stated  that  the  burden  was  on  the
    appellant  to  show  the  existence  of  exceptional   and   compelling
    circumstances for discretionary leave to be considered outside  of  the
    Rules.   It  was  accepted  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.  An  application  for  leave  to
    remain as a dependent  relative  was  submitted  at  the  time  of  the
    hearing, but as the appellant would not  meet  the  requirements  under
    suitability because she was in the UK, this was not pursued.

3.   The appeal proceeded under Article 8 ECHR outside of  the  Rules.   The
    FTT found that the appellant was suffering from depression, high  blood
    pressure and diabetes and had lost some ï¿½8,000 in savings and had  lost
    her home in Mauritius [8/9].

4.   At [18] the FTT did not accept that the appellant lost her  savings  in
    a pyramid fraud and that the loss of her home was not connected to  any
    fraud either.  The appellant was paid  a  pension  and  in  receipt  of
    financial support from her adult  children  in  the  UK  and  could  be
    maintained in Mauritius.  There was no medical evidence of  any  health
    difficulties and there was no evidence  showing  a  lack  of  treatment
    available in Mauritius.  The FTT found that the appellant in  her  role
    as grandmother would be able to continue making visits to and from  the
    UK.

5.   The FTT considered the issue of the mental health  of  the  appellant's
    daughter and whilst  accepting  that  she  helped  to  look  after  her
    daughter, it found and concluded that the evidence failed to show  that
    she was a carer  for  her  daughter.   It  was  acknowledged  that  the
    appellant's daughter suffered from mental  ill  health,  in  particular
    depression, and was due to have an operation for weight problems.   The
    FTT took into account that the daughter was cared for  by  her  brother
    who had limited leave to remain in the UK.

6.   In [18(g) and (h)] the FTT considered the issue of proportionality  and
    concluded that any interference was proportionate.  In this regard  the
    FTT focused on whether or not the appellant established the  burden  of
    showing that her situation was such that it would  be  disproportionate
    for the respondent to require her to return to Mauritius.

Grounds of Application for Permission

7.   In detailed and somewhat generalised grounds it was contended that  the
    FTT failed to give anxious scrutiny to the  appellant's  circumstances,
    in particular that she lived alone and had no  relatives  to  care  for
    her.  The FTT failed to consider  the  sense  of  grief  and  isolation
    suffered by  the  appellant.   Reference  was  made  to  various  cases
    including GS (Article 8 - public interest  not  a  fixity)  Serbia  and
    Montenegro [2005] UKAIT 00121, Huang and EB (Kosovo).  In  relation  to
    Article 8 reference was made in paragraph 15  to  family  life  and  in
    paragraph 16 to Beoku-Betts v SSHD which it was argued  was  overlooked
    by the FTT.

Permission to Appeal

8.   Permission to appeal was granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  E  M
    Simpson on 18 May 2016.  The permitting judge granted an  extension  of
    time and further granted permission in the following terms:

         "Permission to appeal is granted notwithstanding the manifest  lack
         of rigour of the grounds advanced, because  the  substance  of  the
         appeal concerned Article 8 of the  ECHR,  family  life,  and  there
         appeared that the  decision  lacked  a  structured  and  meaningful
         assessment  following  the  Razgar   guidelines   and   Article   8
         authorities amounting to an arguable error of law."


Application for an Adjournment

9.   Mr Subramanian made an application for an adjournment  on  the  grounds
    that the appellant was unable to  attend  the  Upper  Tribunal  hearing
    because her daughter, who had a history of mental ill health, was   ill
    and required to be taken to  hospital  today.   There  was  no  medical
    evidence in support of the application.  The appellant's representative
    accepted that in the light of the fact that this was an  error  of  law
    hearing, it was not necessary for the appellant to attend.

10.  Mr Whitwell made no observations.

Decision re adjournment

11.  I refused the application for an  adjournment.  There  was  no  medical
    evidence produced and no explanation as to why the daughter had  to  go
    to hospital on the day of the hearing in  the  event  that  it  was  an
    emergency. It was not necessary for the appellant to attend  the  error
    of law hearing as she would not be required to  give  evidence.   There
    was no unfairness caused for  the  appellant  by  proceeding  with  the
    hearing. In the event that the Tribunal required  further  evidence  or
    her attendance that could  be considered  as  and  when  the  situation
    arose.

Submissions re: Error of Law

12.  Mr Subramanian submitted that the central point for  consideration  was
    the failure by the FTT to follow the Article 8 and  Razgar  guidelines.
    The FTT failed  to  adopt  a  structured  approach  to  the  Article  8
    assessment and in particular failed to give any weight to the issue  of
    the appellant's daughter's mental ill health.  It  was  submitted  that
    the fact that the appellant took care of her daughter was a factor that
    had been disregarded by the FTT in considering Article 8 family life.

13.  Mr Whitwell submitted that the FTT at [18(h)] properly  concluded  that
    any interference caused  by  removal  was  not  disproportionate.   The
    appellant had not been disadvantaged by any failure of  approach  under
    SS (Congo). It was conceded that  the  FTT  had  not  carried  out  the
    formulaic step-by-step  Razgar  process  but  notwithstanding,  it  was
    submitted that  the  proportionality  assessment  had  been  considered
    adequately and  would  have  been  linked  also  to  an  assessment  of
    compelling and compassionate circumstances following  SS  (Congo).   Mr
    Whitwell further argued  that  the  FTT  had  taken  into  account  the
    appellant's  daughter's  health  in  [18(e)].   The  evidence  in   the
    appellant's witness statement was that she looked after  her  when  she
    could and that she was not the main carer, was  not  inconsistent  with
    the finding in [18(e)].

14.  Mr Whitwell argued that any error was therefore  not  material  as  the
    FTT properly concluded that the interference was proportionate.

15.   Mr  Subramanian  responded  that  the  proportionality  exercise   was
    incomplete without assessing the need to have the appellant present  in
    relation to the maintenance of her daughter's health and that  the  FTT
    failed to take into account evidence at paragraph 14 of the appellant's
    witness statement.  He relied on paragraph 45 of SS (Congo).

Discussion and Decision

16.  The starting point is the grounds  of  application  for  permission  to
    appeal.  The grounds  are generalised and lacking in  specific  detail.
    Yet permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Simpson on  the
    basis that the substance of the appeal under Article 8  ECHR  lacked  a
    structured and meaningful assessment following  the  Razgar  guidelines
    and Article 8 authorities.  It is on that ground that I proceed to deal
    with the error of law issues.  The FTT considered the appeal outside of
    the Rules and acknowledged  the  need  to  consider  the  existence  of
    compassionate  and  compelling  circumstances  under   Article   8   in
    accordance with SS (Congo).  The Decision and  Reasons  summarised  the
    appellant's  case  which  is  that  she  is  penniless,  vulnerable  to
    depression and has lost her home and finance in Mauritius and no longer
    has the resources to  live  and  support  herself  in  Mauritius.   The
    respondent's reasons for refusal are also set out in the  determination
    at [11 to 17].

17.  The main findings of fact are at [ 18(a) - (h)] in the decision.  I  am
    satisfied that the FTT failed to follow the  step-by-step  approach  in
    Razgar, namely to follow the five questions in relation to private  and
    family life.

18.  The burden is on the appellant to  show  that  she  has  a  private  or
    family life capable of engaging Article 8 ECHR and thereafter it is for
    the respondent under Article 8(2)  to  show  why  the  public  interest
    justifies the interference to that right i.e. proportionality.

19.  As a precursor to the  Article  8  assessment  the  FTT  must  consider
    whether or not there are circumstances not covered  by  the  Rules  for
    leave outside of the Rules to be considered.  The FTT has not  followed
    structured approach and it is difficult to ascertain whether or not the
    decision incorporated SS (Congo) guidance in concluding that there  are
    lacking sufficiently  compelling  and  compassionate  circumstances  to
    justify Article 8 outside of the Rules or whether the  FTT  has  simply
    gone beyond that stage and in considering Article 8 erred  by  omitting
    to follow the step-by-step process.   The end result is that either way
    the decision shows an error of law.

20.  The issue for consideration by this Tribunal  is  whether  or  not  the
    error of law was material.    The  evidence  before  the  FTT  and  the
    findings made are not challenged.  Mr Whitwell submitted that if it  is
    accepted that the  first  four  of  the  Razgar  stages  are  met,  the
    outstanding  issue  remains  to  be  proportionality.  I  accept   this
    submission.  Having regard to the findings made on the evidence and  in
    considering proportionality, I am satisfied that the FTT's decision was
    the only conclusion available to it on the evidence before it.

21.  Mr Subramanian  raised  the  question  of  the  appellant's  daughter's
    mental ill health and argued that the FTT  failed  to  take  this  into
    account in considering the appeal.  I disagree. The appeal proceeded on
    the basis that it was the appellant who was dependent on family members
    in the UK, indeed an application was  made  for  her  to  remain  as  a
    dependent relative.  The evidence as regards her daughter was  accepted
    by the FTT who found that she was suffering from depression  and  about
    to have an operation for weight problems. There was medical evidence to
    this effect which confirmed that her brother was  her  carer.    Whilst
    accepting that no specific reference was made or findings  made  as  to
    the precise extent of the relationship between the  appellant  and  her
    daughter, it remains clear that the appeal was not argued on the  basis
    that there was a relationship of  dependence  between  them  above  and
    beyond the normal family ties.

22.  Proceeding on the ground identified in the grant of permission, I  find
    that there is no material error of law in  the  decision  and  Reasons.
    The Decision and Reasons shall stand and the appeal is dismissed.


     No anonymity direction is made.
