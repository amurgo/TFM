Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr O Oshunrinade, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, HOPO


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant has been granted permission to  appeal  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Mailer in which he dismissed the  appellant's
    appeal against the respondent's refusal of her application for leave to
    remain on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Zimbabwe born on [ ] 1983.   She  claimed
    to have entered the UK on 8 December 2003  on  a  false  South  African
    passport.  She applied for asylum a  few  months  after  arrival  on  2
    September 2004.  Her claim was refused on 26 October 2005.  She did not
    appeal against that refusal as she was not advised by anyone to do  so.



3.   In July 2005 she met her British spouse, [RM],  and  they  commenced  a
    relationship.  They were engaged but did not get  married  until  2014.
    They commenced cohabitation in early 2006.   They  started  trying  for
    their own family but she unfortunately lost all her pregnancies.

4.   Since she started living with her British  spouse,  he  has  maintained
    and accommodated her.  In 2009, she was requested by the Home Office to
    complete an immigration mode of  entry  questionnaire  and  to  forward
    passport photographs.  She complied with that request and  was  advised
    that her application for asylum made in 2004 was being considered under
    the older asylum cases called "Legacy Casework".  She was  advised  not
    make any further application until she received an outcome in  relation
    to the Legacy case.  After waiting for  a  long  time,  she  instructed
    another firm of solicitors.  By this time she had been married to  [RM]
    and had lived as a married couple rather than partners.  The  appellant
    produced a certified copy of an entry of marriage  showing  that  their
    marriage was solemnised before the Brighton & Hove Registry on  2  June
    2014.

5.   Her solicitors then advised that she could apply for  leave  to  remain
    on the basis of her marriage and subsisting relationship with a British
    citizen.  On 11 February 2015 she submitted her application, which  was
    refused on 7 May 2015.

6.   The appellant contended that it would be difficult for  her  spouse  to
    relocate to live with her in Zimbabwe as he has never lived there.   He
    does not speak the language  and  has  no  family  there.   His  entire
    family, including his parents, lived in the UK.  She has lived  in  the
    UK continuously since 2003.  Her only parent, namely her mother, passed
    away in 2006.  She does not have anyone or anywhere that she could call
    her own in Zimbabwe.  Relocating there would bring extreme hardship  on
    her husband and as such could not be justified.

7.   She asserted that her long residence here, coupled with the  length  of
    her relationship/marriage to a British citizen  represented  sufficient
    exceptional circumstances to justify being granted leave to  remain  in
    the UK.

8.   In [ ] 2015 her husband  had  a  child,  [EM],  out  of  wedlock,  with
    another person.  The child was now about 1  year  7  months  old.   Her
    husband has played his role in her life as her father.  He was not in a
    relationship with the child's mother, but was able to  have  the  child
    spend time at their home each week.  The child's mother is not  "hands-
    on" and is happy to live her life as a single person while she and  her
    husband do all the work raising the child.  She  feeds  the  child  and
    takes her out to different places.  She stays with her when her husband
    is not around or has gone to work.  The presence of the child in  their
    lives makes it difficult for them to relocate to Zimbabwe.   The  child
    and her husband are bonded.  She seriously doubted whether he would  be
    able to leave the child in the UK and relocate with  her  in  Zimbabwe.
    She too has bonded with the child.   She  and  her  husband  are  still
    trying to conceive.

9.   The appellant said that the  presence  of  the  child  in  their  lives
    constituted sufficient exceptional circumstances,  making  her  removal
    unjustifiable.

10.  The child's birth certificate showed that the child was  born  on  [  ]
    2015.  [RM] and [CB] are recorded as the parents.

11.  The appellant said in oral evidence that she  took  the  child  as  her
    own.  They have her five days a week.  The child's mother works and  is
    busy.  The child stays with them from Monday to Friday.   She  did  not
    know that [CB] was three months pregnant at the date of their marriage.



12.  It was accepted by the  appellant's  solicitors  that  the  appellant's
    husband could not meet the specified gross annual income of �18,600  as
    he was working reduced hours while studying to increase his  vocational
    skills.  In oral evidence he said he worked for an agency.   He  was  a
    painter, decorator and bricklayer.  He has worked for nine  years.   He
    earns about �11 per hour.  He can earn between �350 and �400 a month.

13.  The judge noted  that  in  the  appellant's  application  to  the  Home
    Office, the application was based on her family life as a partner.  She
    stated that she did not have a parental relationship with a  child  who
    was British.  She signed her application on 11 February 2015,  although
    it was sent to the respondent as an enclosure in her solicitor's letter
    dated 20 March 2015.

14.  The judge noted that although the appellant's  stepdaughter,  [EM]  was
    born on [ ] 2015, there  was  no  reference  to  [EM]'s  birth  in  the
    accompanying  representations.   The  submissions  set   out   in   the
    solicitor's letter were to the effect that exception  EX.1  applied  as
    the appellant had  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  her
    partner and there would be  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
    continuing outside the UK.  Her solicitors asserted that any suggestion
    that because the appellant and  her  partner  have  no  children,  they
    somehow fell short of the Immigration  Rules  or  that  there  were  no
    insurmountable obstacles to her partner moving to  Zimbabwe,  would  be
    inconsistent with the factual circumstances of their situation.

15.  The judge also noted  that  the  representations  at  that  stage  were
    confined to the relationship between the  appellant  and  her  husband.
    With regard to the sponsor, it was stated that he was  a  British  born
    citizen who has had all of his work, family and studies in the UK.  His
    mother and sister, his only family members, are  British  citizens  who
    also live here.  His father is deceased.  He has no experience of  life
    outside the UK.  This was not a matter of preference by the appellant's
    partner, but genuine risk and concern.

16.  The judge's findings are set out at [75]-[111].

17.  The judge found that although there was a discrepancy as to the  amount
    of time spent each week  by  the  child  with  the  appellant  and  her
    husband, he accepted that [EM] does spend a significant amount of  time
    with both the appellant and [RM].   He  was  also  satisfied  from  the
    documentary evidence that [RM] could not  satisfy  the  minimum  income
    threshold requirements under the Rules, namely �18,600 per year.

18.  The judge found that the child was still  very  young.   The  appellant
    and her husband have provided free childcare to her mother.   This  has
    enabled [EM]'s mother to continue working, which is on a  shift  basis.
    She sometimes works nights as well as in the day.  The judge  found  at
    paragraph [78] that it would  be  in  the  child's  best  interests  to
    continue the pattern of shared responsibility with  the  appellant  and
    her husband and with her mother.

19.  In assessing whether there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  preventing
    the appellant from continuing her relationship in Zimbabwe,  the  judge
    considered that there were options available to the appellant  and  her
    husband.  He could decide whether to accompany her for  any  period  of
    time to Zimbabwe.  He took into account  the  concern  that  permission
    would not be given to [EM]'s mother to join him there, even  for  short
    visits.  He did not find it unlikely that [EM]'s mother would agree  to
    this.

20.  The judge noted it has not been asserted that the  appellant  and  [RM]
    would not be able to obtain employment in Zimbabwe.  There has been  no
    research undertaken as to his prospective employment opportunities  for
    either of them.

21.  The judge also found that [RM] would also be able to return to  the  UK
    in order to visit and be with his daughter.   He  could  also  continue
    their relationship via modern means of communication,  including  Skype
    and other applications.

22.  The judge found that a further option was that [RM] could  stay  for  a
    period with the appellant while  she  made  an  application  for  entry
    clearance.  Although the time it would take for a decision to  be  made
    is not given, he accepted that it is likely to be in the region of  two
    to three months.  Although the appellant has referred to  the  attempts
    she has made to conceive her own child, there was no evidence that  she
    was currently seeking any medical treatment  or  advice  regarding  her
    repeated miscarriages.

23.  In the light of the evidence relating to both  the  appellant  and  her
    husband jointly, the judge found that there would not be insurmountable
    obstacles in the circumstances.

24.  The judge found that the appellant has spent the majority of  her  life
    in  Zimbabwe.   She  has  social  and  cultural   ties   to   Zimbabwe.
    Consequently, he  found  that  there  would  not  be  very  significant
    obstacles to her integration into Zimbabwe.

25.  The judge had regard to the respondent's contention that there were  no
    exceptional circumstances found in her case.  He noted  that  this  was
    because  the  respondent  was  not  referred  to  the  fact  that   the
    appellant's husband had become the father of a British child at the end
    of January 2015.  No submissions or representations were  made  on  the
    basis of the recent birth of the appellant's husband's  daughter.   The
    position of [EM] was  raised  as  a  significant  circumstance  in  the
    appellant's appeal.  The judge found that this does constitute a  basis
    upon which a grant of leave outside  the  Immigration  Rules  might  be
    warranted.  Accordingly,  he  considered  the  appellant's  application
    under the provisions of Article 8 of the Human Rights  Convention.   He
    had regard to the best interests of the child as a  primary  factor  in
    the assessment as well as considering the  effect  of  the  appellant's
    removal to Zimbabwe on her and her husband.  The judge  had  regard  to
    relevant case law.

26.  The judge found at [96] that it was not  disputed  that  the  appellant
    enjoys family life with her husband in the UK.  They have remained in a
    subsisting relationship since their marriage.  Her husband is a British
    citizen and they both provide care for  his  19  month  old  child  for
    several days during the week.  [RM] is employed and continues to be so.
     At the moment his annual  salary  is  less  than  the  minimum  income
    required under the Rules.  He currently works on a reduced hours basis.



27.  The judge then had regard to the decision in R (on the  application  of
    Chen) v SSHD IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC) and Razgar v SSHD [2004]  UKHL
    27.

28.   The  judge  answered  the  first  four  questions  of  Razgar  in  the
    affirmative.  He  proceeded  to  consider  question  5,  where  he  was
    required  to  conduct  a  balancing  exercise  under  Article  8.    In
    considering the proportionality of the proposed  interference,  he  had
    regard to the public interest considerations under Section 117B of  the
    2002 Act.

29.  The judge found that the appellant entered the UK in December 2003  and
    has remained here ever since.  She has been supported by  her  husband.
    There has been no evidence of any recourse to public funds.   He  found
    that their private and family life enjoyed in the UK has been  unlawful
    and precarious, since shortly after her asylum application was  refused
    on 26 October 2005.  She did not appeal that  decision.   She  met  her
    future husband in July 2005 at  a  time  when  she  did  not  have  any
    immigration status.  Her continued presence in the UK has  always  been
    dependent upon her obtaining a further grant of leave.  If she returned
    to Zimbabwe, even for a temporary period, that removal would  interfere
    with her enjoyment of family and private life.

30.  The judge also considered whether an application  for  entry  clearance
    from Zimbabwe would be granted.  He  found,  for  the  reasons  already
    given,  that  the  appellant  would  not  currently   succeed   in   an
    application.  She cannot  currently  meet  the  financial  requirements
    under Appendix FM and FM-SE of the Rules.

31.  The judge did not regard their reliance on  cases  including  Chikwamba
    to be apposite in the circumstances.  Their return  to  Zimbabwe  would
    not be for the mere sake of formality.  The  appellant  would  have  to
    demonstrate that she meets the relevant requirements under  the  Rules,
    including the production of mandatory specified  evidence.   [RM]  will
    need to find employment so as to meet the relevant  requirements  under
    Appendix FM and FM-SE.  He has not contended that he would not be  able
    to find such  employment.   Such  employment  may  interfere  with  his
    studies, but it is a matter of choice.  As part of the  assessment  the
    judge also found that there were options available to [RM] which he had
    already set out from [84]-[86].

32.  Having regard to the circumstances as a whole,  the  judge  found  that
    the contemplated interference with the appellant's, her  husband's  and
    [EM]'s right to family and private life was not disproportionate.

33.  Permission was granted to the appellant on the basis that at [111]  the
    judge specifically referred to finding  the  contemplated  interference
    with the appellant's, her husband's and  [EM]'s  right  to  family  and
    private life was not disproportionate.   However,  the  judge  did  not
    refer to [EM] from [103]-[110] inclusive.  It  was  arguable  that  the
    allusion to paragraphs  [84]-[86]  was  insufficient  in  applying  the
    conclusions to be drawn from the  application  of  Section  55  and  in
    considering the position of the child.

34.  Mr Oshunrinade submitted that the judge erred  in  law  because  having
    concluded at [78] that "It would be in the child's  best  interests  to
    continue the pattern of shared responsibility with  the  appellant  and
    her husband, and with her mother", the judge should have found that the
    appellant has a genuine relationship with a British child.   He  should
    therefore have concluded that the appellant should be allowed to remain
    in the UK to continue looking after her stepdaughter.

35.   Mr  Oshunrinade  further  submitted   that   in   carrying   out   the
    proportionality assessment, the judge did not consider [EM]  who  is  a
    British child.  If he had done so the judge would have  found  that  it
    would not be disproportionate for the appellant to return to  Zimbabwe,
    particularly in the light of his finding at [78].

36.  Mr Tufan submitted that the judge made several observations as  to  how
    the child was not mentioned at all to the Secretary  of  State  in  her
    application  or  representations.   The  judge  also  found  that   the
    appellant through her husband was involved with the care of  the  child
    for a number of days in the week.   Mr  Tufan  however  submitted  that
    Section 117B(6) refers to an applicant who has a genuine and subsisting
    "parental relationship" with a qualifying  child.   He  submitted  that
    there was no evidence of the appellant's parental relationship with the
    child for paragraph 117B(6) to come into play.

37.  He submitted that at [96] the judge found that both parents  cared  for
    the child for several days of the week.  Mr  Tufan  questioned  whether
    the appellant can be regarded as the child's stepmother.  He  submitted
    that the judge's findings do not amount to a  "parental  relationship".
    The judge notwithstanding considered the matter  under  a  freestanding
    Article 8.  The evidence had to be compelling.  Mr Tufan submitted that
    strictly the judge erred because he did not consider the best interests
    of the child.

38.  Mr Tufan submitted that the decision in Chen was upheld  by  the  Court
    of Appeal in Agyarko & Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 440.    Mr  Tufan  submitted
    that there was no evidence from a social worker as regards the  child's
    best interests.  He submitted that the child's best interest is  to  be
    with her parents.  He submitted that the judge did not apply the  ratio
    that it would be disproportionate, if a  child  is  involved,  for  the
    appellant to return to Zimbabwe to make an entry clearance application.



39.  Mr Oshunrinade in reply submitted that the witness statement  from  the
    appellant and the oral evidence provided led the judge to believe  that
    there was a parental relationship between the appellant and the  child.
    Even though the judge did not deal with the  relationship  between  the
    appellant and the child, the judge used the word  "care"  to  refer  to
    their relationship.

40.  Mr Tufan relied on the decision in R  (on  the  application  of  RK)  v
    Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department  (s.117B(6);  "parental
    relationship") IJR [2016] UKUT 00031 (IAC).  Mr Tufan submitted that in
    head note 2 step-parent relationship was defined as stepping "into  the
    shoes" of a child's mother.

41.  I find that the judge erred in law in his assessment of Article 8.   At
    [102] the judge  correctly  directed  himself  that  in  proceeding  to
    consider question 5 of Razgar, he is required to  conduct  a  balancing
    exercise under Article 8.  From [103]-[110] there was no  reference  by
    the judge to the British child [EM], the relationship between [EM]  and
    the appellant and her father and the child's best interests in  all  of
    these relationships.  Accordingly, I find that the judge erred  in  his
    conclusion  at  [111]  that  the  contemplated  interference  with  the
    appellant's, her husband's and [EM]'s right to family and private  life
    was not disproportionate.

42.  Consequently, the judge's decision under Article  8  cannot  stand.   I
    remake the decision.  This is because  Mr  Oshunrinade  submitted  that
    this was an issue that I could determine if I found that there  was  an
    error of law.

43.  I find that the judge rightly made several observations as to  how  the
    child was not mentioned at all in the appellant's  application  to  the
    Secretary of State or in her representations.   This  was  despite  the
    fact that when the appellant signed  her  application  on  11  February
    2015, [EM] was 1 month old; and when the application was  sent  to  the
    respondent as an enclosure in her solicitor's  letter  dated  20  March
    2015, the child was 2 months old.  The child only became  part  of  the
    story at the hearing which took place on 30 August 2016, by which  time
    the child was about 20 months old.

44.  Mr Tufan submitted  that  Section  117B(6)  does  not  come  into  play
    because this paragraph refers to  "parental  relationship".   Paragraph
    117B(6) states as follows:-

         "(6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
             public interest does not require the person's removal where-


               (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
                  relationship with a qualifying child, and


              (b)      it would not be reasonable to  expect  the  child  to
                  leave the United Kingdom."

45.  The issue is whether the appellant qualifies as  a  parent  who  has  a
    genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship  with  [EM],  who  is  a
    qualifying child because she is a British national.  RK which,  in  its
    head note, defines a step-parent as one who steps into the shoes  of  a
    parent.

46.  On the evidence in this case I do  not  find  that  the  appellant  has
    stepped into the shoes of the child's mother.  The judge found at  [77]
    that the appellant and her  husband  provided  free  childcare  to  the
    child's mother.  This has enabled [EM]'s mother  to  continue  working,
    which is on a shift basis and sometimes works nights as well as in  the
    day.  This finding, which has not been disputed, is not  evidence  that
    the appellant has stepped into the shoes of the child's mother.  I find
    that by providing free childcare to the child's mother,  the  appellant
    is merely providing a service that is convenient  to  the  mother.   It
    enables the mother to work.  If the  appellant  were  not  around,  the
    child's mother would have to find a childminder to  provide  that  care
    while she was at work, with the child's father playing a  part  in  her
    care.

47.  Consequently, I find that Section 117B(6) does not come  into  play  in
    this case.

48.  I now consider the appellant's case outside of  the  Immigration  Rules
    under Article 8.  I find,  as  did  the  judge,  that  the  first  four
    questions of Razgar can be answered  in  the  affirmative.   Therefore,
    there remains the conduct of a balancing exercise under Article 8.

49.  I shall adopt  the  judge's  findings  of  fact  which  have  not  been
    disputed.  They are that the appellant enjoys a family  life  with  her
    husband in the UK.  They have remained  in  a  subsisting  relationship
    since their marriage.  Her husband is a British citizen and  they  both
    provide care for his 19 months old child for several  days  during  the
    week.

50.  The judge found at [78] that it would be in the child's best  interests
    to continue the pattern of shared responsibility with the appellant and
    her husband and with her mother.  I  do  not  however  find  that  this
    shared pattern amounts to exceptional circumstances for the purposes of
    Article 8.  If the appellant were not here, the child's care  would  be
    continued by the child's father, that is the  appellant's  husband  and
    the child's mother.

51.  The appellant entered the UK in December 2003  and  has  remained  here
    unlawfully ever since.  She formed a relationship with her  husband  in
    the knowledge that she had no right to be in the United Kingdom and  at
    a time when her circumstances were precarious.  I am not persuaded that
    her relationship with the child by way of childcare for several days of
    the week amounts to exceptional circumstances, such that she  ought  to
    be granted leave to remain outside the Immigration Rules.

52.  Accordingly, I find that the child's best interests are to remain  with
    her mother and her father in the UK.

53.  I find that the appellant's removal would  not  be  a  disproportionate
    interference in her family and private life.

Notice of Decision

54.  I dismiss the appellant's appeal.

55.  No anonymity direction is made.
