Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss A F Miller, of Hamilton Burns & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs S Saddiq, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. By determination promulgated on 21 May 2015, First-Tier Tribunal  Judge
    Farrelly dismissed the appellant's appeal, advanced under  the  Refugee
    Convention on the basis of risk to her  in  Pakistan  as  an  unmarried
    mother.  The Judge did not find her to be a credible witness.

 2. The appellant did not insist upon her ground of appeal number 1.

 3. Ground of appeal number 2 says:-

         "At paragraph 34 ... the Judge makes  the  finding  that  Mr  Yusuf
         [father of the appellant's child] is  the  appellant's  spouse  ...
         this is speculation ... no evidence was submitted ... with  regards
         to marriage and no submissions were made by either  party  to  this
         effect.  The Judge has failed to provide adequate reasoning why  he
         has come to this conclusion ...."

 4. Miss Miller submitted that the finding of a marriage was unsupported by
    documentary evidence, oral evidence or any reasoning.  Mr Yusuf in  his
    statement and in oral evidence said that he and the appellant  were  no
    longer together.  The issue was plainly material to a  claim  based  on
    risk as an unmarried mother,  which  the  determination  recognised  at
    paragraphs 18 and 39 to be a real possibility.  It  was  accepted  that
    the Judge gave some reasons for the negative findings regarding aspects
    of the appellant's evidence, but Miss Miller maintained that there were
    no reasons for the finding on the marriage.

 5. Ground 3 says:-

         "[If]  the Judge was entitled to come to the finding that Mr  Yusuf
         was the appellant's spouse ... the Judge has erred  in  failing  to
         carry  out  a  proportionality  assessment  with  regard   to   the
         appellant's and her "husband's" Article  8  rights  should  she  be
         removed ..."

 6. Miss Miller submitted  that  a  proportionality  exercise  fell  to  be
    carried out on the basis  of  the  alternative  finding,  although  she
    accepted that it was difficult to put such a case when the  appellant's
    instructions were that the facts were quite to the contrary.

 7. Ground of appeal number 4 says:-

         "At paragraph 34 ... the Judge states  "however,  no  evidence  has
         been led to confirm his status in the UK".  A copy  of  Mr  Yusuf's
         biometric residence permit was lodged ... the Judge failed to  take
         into consideration evidence that he should have had regard to."

 8. Miss Miller accepted that this was not a ground which on its own  might
    lead to the determination being set aside, but  said  that  it  was  an
    obvious error which added to the overall criticism.

 9. Finally, Miss Miller submitted that the  determination  should  be  set
    aside and a rehearing of the evidence undertaken to determine the  true
    extent of the relationship between the appellant and Mr Yusuf.

10. Mrs Saddiq submitted that the Judge dealt very appropriately  with  the
    credibility of the evidence of the appellant.  He had particular regard
    to the cultural background and context, for example at paragraphs 15-18
    and 24.  He explained why he did not find her to be  as  naï¿½ve  as  she
    suggested.  He gave good reasons for rejecting her  account  about  her
    immigration history, her illegal residence for over two years, why  she
    was unable to produce or replace her Pakistani passport, why a marriage
    was proposed but did not proceed, and inconsistencies in what she  said
    to the police, to the respondent and to the tribunal about the loss  of
    her  passport.   At  paragraph  33  the  judge  took  account  of   the
    possibility of the claim being true against  the  cultural  background,
    along with the implausibility of those aspects, but concluded  that  he
    did not believe the appellant's account about her child being born  out
    of wedlock, and that this allegation was made in order to remain  based
    on a false asylum claim which did not reflect any risk  of  persecution
    on return.   Those  were  more  than  sufficiently  reasoned  findings,
    properly weighed up, which were sufficient to dispose of the case.   As
    to ground 3 even if the Judge had looked  further  at  proportionality,
    based on his findings the outcome would have been no different,  in  or
    out of the Rules.  Failure to note  the  evidence  of  the  immigration
    status of Mr Yusuf made no  difference  as  the  child  was  not  a  UK
    citizen.  The determination should stand.

11. I raised the question whether the finding on the marriage at  paragraph
    34  went  further  than  was  strictly  necessary,  and   whether   the
    conclusions at  paragraph  33  would  have  been  enough.   Mrs  Saddiq
    submitted that the finding on the marriage was well within the scope of
    the Judge and did not reflect any error.  She  said  that  the  finding
    that they were spouses was intended to reflect an Islamic  ceremony  as
    mentioned at paragraph 19, not a marriage legally registered in the UK.
     An Islamic marriage would be  all  that  would  be  required  for  the
    appellant not to be perceived as an unmarried mother in Pakistan.

12. Miss Miller  in  response  acknowledged  that  the  Judge  referred  to
    background evidence and to the cultural context,  but  emphasised  that
    the finding on the marriage was material, and that it was based  on  no
    direct evidence whatsoever.

13. I indicated that I was not satisfied that there was any error  such  as
    to require the determination to be set aside.

14. While Miss Miller focussed on such points as might be criticised in the
    determination, I broadly preferred the submissions  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent, as summarised above.  The Judge was entitled to  find  that
    the appellant failed to prove her case.  He gave several good  reasons,
    set out in the determination and founded upon by Mrs Saddiq.  It  makes
    no difference that the status document of Mr Yusuf was overlooked.

15. The conclusions at paragraph 33 were sufficient to dispose of the case.

16. I do not think that the conclusion about a marriage at paragraph 34 was
    speculative or unreasonable.  Rather, it was a sensible inference  from
    all the information before the Judge.  It is  unsurprising  that  there
    was no direct evidence when the fact of the marriage, if  such  be  the
    case, is one which the  appellant  and  her  witness  were  anxious  to
    conceal from the tribunal.  I also agree that by a marriage  the  judge
    meant an Islamic marriage not given legal form in UK law (and hence not
    on UK official records).  But even if his finding  went  too  far,  the
    point would be immaterial.

17. The appellant's  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  dismissed.   The
    determination of the First-Tier Tribunal shall stand.

18. No anonymity order has been requested or made.
