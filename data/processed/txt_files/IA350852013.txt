Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Chohan, Counsel, instructed by S.Z. Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The respondent is a citizen of India born on 21st November,  1947.   He
    made application on 6th July, 2012 for indefinite leave  to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom based on his long residence.  On 12th  August,  2013
    the Secretary  of  State  refused  the  respondent's  application.  The
    respondent appealed and his appeal was  heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Deavin on 30th  January,  2014.   She  allowed  the  respondent's
    appeal.

2.   At a hearing on 11th June, 2014 the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department successfully  challenged  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge, at a hearing before Upper Tribunal Judge  Birrell,  who
    found that the First-tier Tribunal erred  in  reaching  its  conclusion
    that the respondent's appeal should be allowed.  Mr  Jarvis  today  has
    explained that in fact those errors were not material.   The  appellant
    was entitled to have his appeal allowed on the basis that  he  was  not
    required to  demonstrate  that  he  had  a  knowledge  of  the  English
    language.

3.   Mr Jarvis invited me to allow the respondent's  appeal.   I  find  that
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Deavin did not materially err in  law  and  I
    uphold her decision.
