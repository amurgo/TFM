Officer

                    Lawyers Limited


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal allowing  the  claimant's  appeal  against  the
    Entry  Clearance  Officer's  decision  to  refuse  the  claimant  entry
    clearance to join her sponsor, a British citizen, under Appendix FM  of
    the Immigration Rules HC395 (as amended).

Background

 2. The claimant is a citizen of the People's  Republic  of  China  with  a
    passport issued by the Macau Special Administration  Region.   She  was
    born on 7 June 1965 and married Kong Wai Hong in Macau  on  13  October
    1992.  They have three children together.  The claimant's children  are
    estranged from her by reason of  the  separation  and  divorce  between
    their parents.  Her mother still lives in Macau and they appear to have
    a good relationship. The claimant's marriage was dissolved by the Macau
    Primary Court, Family and Minors division, on 6 October 2017.

 3. The claimant came to the United Kingdom unlawfully in 2006.  In  August
    2007, the claimant was arrested and served with removal  directions  as
    an illegal entrant, giving her name as Yu Way  Kim.   She  was  granted
    temporary admission, but absconded without reporting as required.

 4. In December 2007, she met the sponsor, [SRM], at a New Year  party  and
    they began a relationship.  The claimant told him her name  was  Cindy,
    and later, that it was Yu Way Kim, but did not  disclose  the  identity
    which she now says is her real name, Lai Heong Lao.

 5. The claimant was arrested again three years later, on 2  October  2010,
    granted temporary  admission,  but  failed  to  comply  with  reporting
    requirements and absconded for a second time.  This  was  when  Mr  [M]
    discovered that her real name was Lai Heong Lao.

 6. The claimant was next heard of in October 2012, applying for  leave  to
    remain on the basis of her relationship with Mr [M].  The Secretary  of
    State refused her leave to remain on the basis of that relationship  in
    October 2013, and the claimant finally left the United  Kingdom  on  16
    February 2015, 18 months after the refusal.

 7. The claimant made the present application using a  passport  issued  in
    Macau on 17 March 2015 in the Lai Heong Lao  identity,  which  did  not
    disclose the two previous visits, nor the fact that she had  previously
    used a different identity, Way Kim Yu.  The claimant stated  only  that
    she had previously been known as 'Cindy', and asserted that she had not
    made an application to remain in the United  Kingdom  in  the  last  10
    years, and also that she had not been deported, removed,  or  otherwise
    required to leave any country, including the  United  Kingdom,  in  the
    past 10 years.  None of those statements was truthful.  The  respondent
    considered that the claimant had failed to disclose material facts  and
    refused the application for entry clearance under paragraph EC-P1.1.(c)
    of Appendix FM with reference to paragraph S-EC.2.2.(b).

 8. The Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that Mr [M] had  provided
    evidence of his earnings in excess of �18600 per annum.   The specified
    documents  were  not  provided,  although  the  claimant's  application
    asserted that he, as a self-employed builder,  earned  �22000  a  year.
    There was no difficulty with the English language requirement but given
    the failure on financial and suitability grounds, and the lack  of  any
    exceptional circumstances engaging paragraphs GEN.3.1 AND GEN.3.2,  the
    application was refused.

 9. The claimant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

First-tier Tribunal decision

10. First-tier Judge Aziz allowed the appeal.   He  was  impressed  by  the
    sponsor, whom he  assessed  as  a  credible  witness.   The  Presenting
    Officer did not cross-examine the sponsor and  his  evidence  therefore
    stands unchallenged.

11. The sponsor said that from 2008  onwards,  he  supported  the  claimant
    financially, but it was not until 2010 that he was made  aware  of  her
    immigration problems or her dual identity.  From that time on, he tried
    to help the applicant resolve her immigration  status.  An  application
    for leave to remain was made in December 2012, once all  the  documents
    had been assembled, in the name of Way  Kim  Yu.   It  was  refused  in
    October 2013.

12. Cindy, as the sponsor knew her, was afraid to return to  China  because
    she had no relationship with her three sons there, since her separation
    from her Chinese husband.  Her mother lived in China, but the  claimant
    had no income or life in China.  In January 2015, the  claimant  showed
    Mr [M] her passport in her real name of Lai Heong  Lao:  she  told  him
    that when arrested in 2007, she had panicked and given a false name, to
    avoid deportation. In January 2015, the sponsor took  the  claimant  to
    the Chinese embassy in London to get a travel  document  to  return  to
    China in the Lai Heong Lao identity, her real name.

13. The claimant went back to China on 16 February 2015 and obtained a  new
    passport there in the Lai Heong Lao identity.  The  sponsor  went  with
    her, accompanying her to her  mother's  home,  then  returning  to  the
    United Kingdom on 23 March 2015.  Three months later, in June 2015, the
    claimant returned on a visit visa to the United Kingdom.  She went back
    to China on 2 February 2016, just within the  6  months  of  her  visit
    visa.  In May 2016, the sponsor visited her in China for just under two
    weeks.  In October 2016, he went to China and came back to  the  United
    Kingdom with the claimant.  On 1 March  2017,  within  the  visit  visa
    period, they both went back to China,  the  sponsor  returning  to  the
    United Kingdom on 9 April 2017.

14. Two months later, the claimant came back to the  United  Kingdom  on  8
    June 2017.   At Gatwick  airport,  the  Immigration  Officer  told  the
    claimant that she could not keep coming in on visit visas as she was in
    a relationship.  She left the United Kingdom on 14 September  2017  and
    had not been admitted to the United Kingdom since  then,  although  the
    sponsor visited her in China from 23 April 2018  to  4  May  2018.  The
    sponsor says that he cannot move to China as he has elderly parents  in
    the United Kingdom and also for financial reasons.

15. On 6 October 2017 the claimant's  Chinese  marriage  was  dissolved  by
    mutual consent. The sponsor stands ready to spend the rest of his  life
    with the claimant, and marry  her,  now  that  she  is  free.   He  has
    produced evidence of the purchase of wedding rings from a jeweller's in
    China, and also a West Sussex  Superintendent  Registrar's  Certificate
    dated 28 December 2017, certifying no impediment  to  marriage  between
    these parties.  It has not been possible  for  them  to  marry  in  the
    United Kingdom, since she cannot get entry clearance to come  here  and
    do so.

16. The sponsor helped the claimant get a visa to travel to Australia  with
    him in December 2018 and January 2019,  then  they  returned  to  China
    together on 11 January 2019, where the sponsor spent another  3  weeks,
    returning to the United Kingdom on 31 January 2019.  Back in the United
    Kingdom, he investigated alternative visas and applied  for  a  fianc�e
    visa.  Local help was provided  by  JPS  Immigration  who  put  in  the
    application and included incorrect dates, also failing to  declare  the
    previous application in the claimant's false  name.   The  sponsor  has
    apologised for that omission.

17. The Judge  noted  that  the  appellant  accepted  that  she  had  given
    different names to the immigration officials with whom she  dealt:  Way
    Kim Yu, Cindy, and Lai Heong Lao.  Her case was that  the  identity  of
    Way Kim Yu which she used between 2007 and 2015 was a  false  identity,
    and that the identity of Lai Heong Lao, used first  on  the  brand  new
    passport which supported her current entry clearance  application,  was
    her real identity.

18. The Judge  was  presented  with  expired  and  current  passports,  the
    claimant's travel permit for Hong Kong and  Macau  residents,  a  Macau
    issued certificate, and her parents' identity and divorce  papers.   He
    found as a fact that Lai Heong Lao was her real identity, based on that
    evidence, and found that paragraph 320(3) was not engaged.

19. The Judge noted that the  appellant  had  entered  the  United  Kingdom
    illegally, used a false name, and not complied with the  conditions  of
    her temporary admission.  He did  not  consider  that  under  paragraph
    320(11), the claimant's absconding would make a material difference  to
    the outcome of the appeal, given her otherwise poor immigration history
    and the false representations and false identities she had used.

20.  The  Judge  noted  that  paragraph  320(11)  was  discretionary,   not
    mandatory.  The claimant had made a number of visits to the sponsor  in
    the United Kingdom since her voluntary departure in February 2015,  all
    on visit visas, and had left before the visas expired. He accepted that
    she and the sponsor were in  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship:
    indeed the Home Office Presenting Officer had not challenged that.   He
    considered that the Secretary  of  State's  discretion  should  not  be
    exercised against the claimant in this instance.   He  noted  that  the
    evidence of the sponsor's finances, which did not accompany  the  entry
    clearance application, had subsequently been provided and considered it
    to be adequate.

21. The Judge noted that the only basis for appealing  an  entry  clearance
    decision was now  that  it  was  in  breach  of  the  United  Kingdom's
    international obligations under the ECHR, as implemented by  section  6
    of the Human Rights Act 1998, specifically her family life rights under
    Article 8 ECHR.   Having satisfied himself that all of the requirements
    of the Immigration Rules were met, and that  the  claimant  had  family
    life with the sponsor, he considered the provisions of section 117B  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended) and found
    that all were neutral.  There was nothing in the public  interest  that
    'weighs against their intention to live their family life  together  in
    the  United  Kingdom'  and  the  Secretary  of  State's  decision   was
    disproportionate.  The First-tier Judge allowed the appeal.

22. The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal.

Permission to appeal

23. The Secretary of State relied on paragraph S-EC 2.2 of the  Immigration
    Rules and the failure to disclose the previous identities she had used.
     She argued that the First-tier Judge's  reasoning  was  inadequate  in
    this respect.

24. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Stephen  Smith
    on that basis, considering it  arguable  that  the  Judge  should  have
    considered whether paragraph S-EC  2.2  was  engaged,  making  this  an
    application which 'should normally be refused' and what the  impact  on
    the present application  should  be  of  the  false  information  given
    therein.

Rule 24 Reply

25. There was no Rule 24 Reply on behalf of the claimant.

26. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Upper Tribunal hearing

27. At the hearing, Mr Aiken for the claimant argued  that  the  First-tier
    Judge had applied his mind to the deception and made no material  error
    in his assessment of the proportionality of her exclusion.

28. Mr Jarvis relied on the grounds of appeal and grant of permission.

29. I reserved my decision, which I now give.

Analysis

30. The refusal letter in this appeal is dated 1  September  2018  and  was
    served on the claimant on 17 October 2018.  On that date, having regard
    to the provisions of section 82(2) of the Nationality, Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 (as amended) by the Immigration Act 2014, there was  no
    right of appeal against the substance of the Entry Clearance  Officer's
    decision to refuse entry clearance, but only on human rights grounds.

31. As the First-tier Judge identified, even if the claimant has shown  now
    that she could have adduced evidence at the date of  application  which
    would have met the requirements of the Immigration  Rules,  the  First-
    tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal are not seised of any challenge to
    the decision under the Rules.

32. The claimant was in the United Kingdom unlawfully from 2006 until 2015,
    and the relationship on which she relies  developed  from  31  December
    2007 until her departure in 2015,  and  thereafter  was  maintained  by
    visits here on visit visas, and Mr [M]'s visits to  her  in  China,  as
    well as a joint trip to Australia. The parties  are  not  married,  the
    claimant not having been free to marry until 2017.  They have spent  as
    much time as possible together since they met, both here, in China, and
    on their visit to Australia.  They assert that they  have  private  and
    family life together.

33. Section 117B is not, as the First-tier Judge thought,  neutral  to  the
    outcome of this appeal.  Having regard to  sub-section  117B(4)(b)  the
    Tribunal is required to give little weight to any private life  or  any
    relationship established with a qualifying partner (such as Mr [M])  at
    a time when the claimant was in the United  Kingdom  unlawfully,  which
    she was for her entire residence from 2006 to 2015.

34. The human rights appeal is therefore bound to fail.

DECISION


35. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law.

    I set aside the previous decision.  I remake the decision by dismissing
    the appeal.
