                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Marfat, Solicitor Newcastle Legal Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr Mangion, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

        1. The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh. He applied  for  entry
           clearance as the spouse of the sponsor on 14 July 2014, and  his
           application was refused on 29 August 2014 by  reference  to  the
           requirements of Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules.
        2. The Appellant duly appealed against  that  immigration  decision
           and his appeal was heard on 30 April 2015, when it was dismissed
           under the Immigration Rules  and  on  Article  8  grounds  in  a
           Decision promulgated on 12 May 2015 by First Tier Tribunal Judge
           Hands.
        3. The Appellant's out  of  time  application  to  the  First  Tier
           Tribunal for permission to appeal was admitted, and granted,  by
           the First Tier Tribunal Judge Landes on 7 September 2015. Whilst
           the grounds were described as convoluted, they were taken to  be
           intended to raise the complaint that the Judge had in the course
           of writing her decision taken a new point against the Appellant,
           with  the  consequence  that  he  had  been  deprived   of   the
           opportunity of dealing with that point during the course of  the
           appeal hearing, thereby rendering  the  appeal  process  unfair.
           Whilst this was said to be arguable the Appellant was  expressly
           warned that it was  far  from  clear  from  the  papers  on  the
           Tribunal file whether in the event that this argument were  made
           out it would establish any  material  error  of  law,  since  no
           calculation had been performed  by  the  Appellant  of  the  net
           deposits to the sponsor's bank account in the  relevant  period,
           which were evidenced  as  required  by  the  payslips  and  bank
           statements that were in evidence. Thus the Appellant might  fail
           to demonstrate that he met the requirements of  the  Immigration
           Rules at the date of decision in any event.
        4. The Respondent filed a Rule 24 response dated 11 September  2015
           in which it was argued the Appellant had failed to  explain  why
           the claims made for the sponsor's net wages in her payslips  did
           not tally with the sums deposited into her bank account, and had
           failed to  demonstrate  by  way  of  the  evidence  required  in
           Appendix FM-SE that the sums deposited into her bank account met
           the income threshold set out in Appendix FM.
        5. Thus the matter comes before me.

      The decision under appeal
        6. The Appellant's application for leave was made on the basis that
           he met the requirements of Appendix FM to the Immigration  Rules
           for a grant of entry clearance as the spouse of the sponsor.  As
           part of that application he had relied upon what he had declared
           to  be  the  sponsor's  true  income  of  �18,943.60.  If   that
           declaration was correct, and the sponsor's income was  evidenced
           in the way required by Appendix FM and  FM-SE  then  her  income
           would indeed exceed the minimum income threshold requirements of
           �18,600. The total income relied upon was  said  to  be  derived
           from two concurrent employments held with  different  employers;
           AR trading as AHC, and, RCL.
        7. The application was refused by the Respondent on 29 August  2014
           by reference to paragraphs EC-P.1.1(c), S-EC.2.2(a), EC-P.1.1(d)
           and  E-ECP.3.1.  This  was  because  upon  an  analysis  of  the
           available evidence, and the checks that had been undertaken with
           HMRC, the Respondent was satisfied that the Appellant  had  made
           false declarations as  to  the  sponsor's  true  income,  having
           concluded that  the  sponsor's  income  from  each  of  the  two
           employments relied upon had been artificially inflated  for  the
           purpose of the application beyond the rates of pay that had been
           paid to her by each of those two employers during the  preceding
           tax year of 2013/4, when on the face of  the  evidence  she  had
           performed the same role, and neither of those employers was in a
           financial position to be generous to its employees.


      The Respondent's case before the First Tier Tribunal
        8. It is plain from the decision, and it is not in  dispute  before
           me, that the sponsor was the  subject  of  an  extensive  cross-
           examination designed primarily to demonstrate that if there were
           indeed two genuine employments, the work she had  performed  for
           the two employers in  the  six  months  prior  to  the  date  of
           application,  was  exactly  the  same  as  that  which  she  had
           performed for them in the 2013/4 tax year. Thus  the  Respondent
           sought to demonstrate that there was  no  legitimate  commercial
           reason for the increase in wages that was relied upon, and  that
           those wages had been artificially inflated for  the  purpose  of
           supporting the entry clearance application.
        9. The Judge also recorded the Respondent's argument that (although
           they were based locally to the hearing centre)  neither  of  the
           two employers relied upon had offered any explanation for  their
           failure to attend the hearing in order either to  speak  to  the
           documents that were  relied  upon  by  the  Appellant  and  thus
           confirm the true rates of pay,  or,  to  explain  why  they  had
           increased the sponsor's weekly wage so  significantly  from  the
           sums that had been paid to her by them during the preceding  tax
           year. Whilst the minimum wage had  increased  during  this  time
           period, that increase would not account for the difference,  and
           thus the increase in wages paid for doing the  same  job  called
           for  a  credible  explanation  from  those  employers.  In   the
           circumstances it is plain that the Respondent argued before  the
           Judge that very little weight could be attached to the sponsor's
           evidence concerning her true earnings, and  that  there  was  no
           reliable evidence to explain why they had increased  in  advance
           of the Appellant's application for  entry  clearance,  with  the
           result that the Judge should conclude that  these  earnings  had
           been artificially inflated.
       10. Equally it is plain that the cross-examination  of  the  sponsor
           was not solely directed to the issue of whether her earnings had
           been artificially inflated, but it also went to the question  of
           whether a number of the sums deposited into the  sponsor's  bank
           account failed to tally with the sums recorded in the  documents
           that were said to be her genuine payslips.
       11. The Judge also recorded that at the hearing the argument of  the
           Respondent's representative that even  if  the  two  employments
           were genuine, the weekly income that was relied upon at the date
           of the application was only �345.55,  which  meant  at  best  an
           annual income of �17,968.60, which  did  not  meet  the  �18,600
           threshold required by Appendix FM  [6].  That  was  a  different
           stance to that which the ECO had  taken  in  reliance  upon  the
           "real time earnings" information that had been provided by  HMRC
           of �189.30 pw from AR trading as AHC,  and  �175  pw  from  RCL.
           There is  no  suggestion  in  the  decision  or  the  record  of
           proceedings that Mr Marfat, who also appeared for the  Appellant
           below, objected to this  argument  as  in  any  way  taking  the
           Appellant by surprise, or as  one  that  was  not  open  to  the
           Respondent.


      The Appellant's complaint
       12. I asked Mr Marfat to try to summarise the grounds  that  he  had
           drafted, which  Judge  Landes  had  not  unkindly  described  as
           "convoluted".  He  told  me  that  Judge  Landes  had  correctly
           identified the only point that he sought to make in drafting the
           grounds, and that this was the only complaint that he wished  to
           advance of the Judge's decision.
       13. Mr Marfat accepted that it was a fair summary of  his  argument,
           that  in  circumstances  such  as  these,  where  the  ECO   had
           challenged an application on the basis of  fraud,  the  ECO  was
           obliged to set out expressly any alternative fall back  argument
           that he sought to advance, failing which he would  be  prevented
           from doing so. Thus he argued that  if  the  Tribunal  were  not
           satisfied that the  sponsor's  earnings  had  been  artificially
           inflated, it was not open to the Tribunal to go on  to  consider
           whether  the  evidence  relied  upon  met  the  requirements  of
           Appendix FM-SE, and Appendix FM. In this case, since  there  was
           no such point expressly taken in the alternative, once the Judge
           had concluded that she was not satisfied that the ECO  had  made
           out his case on fraud, he argued that she was obliged  to  allow
           the appeal.
       14. Mr Marfat accepted that he had paid no heed to the  warning  set
           out in the grant of permission. Thus he had made no  attempt  to
           calculate the net deposits to the sponsor's bank account in  the
           relevant period, which were evidenced by, and were referable  to
           the entries in the bank statements relied upon, and the payslips
           that had been placed in evidence. He had no explanation for that
           failure.
       15. Mr Marfat argued that it was for the Tribunal to perform all  of
           the necessary calculations to determine  whether  the  Appellant
           had met the requirements of Appendix FM and FM-SE. (It  was  not
           at all clear why, or how, any such obligation would arise if his
           argument about the limited scope of the appeal was correct.)  He
           accepted that in doing so, the  Tribunal  could  refer  to  only
           those deposits into the sponsor's bank account that were made in
           the relevant period, were recorded in  the  bank  statements  in
           evidence, and which were referable to the sums recorded upon the
           payslips that were said to have been issued to her  by  the  two
           employers. I asked him what the  arithmetic  result  of  such  a
           calculation would be, and he accepted that he did not know.


      Conclusion
       16. It is not in my judgement clear from the decision that the Judge
           properly engaged with the Respondent's case, which was never  to
           allege simply that the sponsor was not genuinely employed by the
           two employers, but rather to allege that if  she  was  genuinely
           employed by them, that  the  sums  paid  to  her  by  those  two
           employers (and declared by them to HMRC as having been  paid  by
           way of earned income) had  been  dishonestly  inflated  for  the
           purpose of supporting  the  Appellant's  application  for  entry
           clearance. Mr Marfat expressly conceded to me that he had always
           understood the Respondent's case to cover both.
       17. Arguably there  is  no  analysis  of  the  relevant  burden  and
           standard of proof, and no clear identification  that  the  Judge
           understood this to be the true nature of the  refusal  decision,
           and no clear finding of fact upon whether  the  sponsor's  wages
           had been dishonestly inflated. In my  judgement  the  reader  is
           left with the distinct  impression  that  the  Judge  mistakenly
           understood the disputed issue to be simply whether  the  sponsor
           was actually employed by the two employers during  the  relevant
           periods, and that  she  failed  to  make  any  analysis  of  the
           evidence concerning why two small employers would  increase  the
           sponsor's wages in the way that the Appellant  and  the  sponsor
           had claimed they had done, when she did not claim in  he  course
           of her evidence that her role had materially altered.
       18. It is however abundantly clear from the decision that the  Judge
           did understand the appeal to be argued by  the  Respondent  upon
           the alternative basis that even if the  sponsor  were  genuinely
           employed by both employers, that the Appellant had  nevertheless
           failed to demonstrate that the evidence he relied upon  met  the
           requirements of Appendix FM and  FM-SE,  and  thus  he  met  the
           minimum income threshold [16-19]. It is  also  in  my  judgement
           clear that the Appellant's representative raised no objection to
           that approach at the time. It is extremely difficult to see  how
           the Appellant's representative could have failed  to  appreciate
           that this was the Respondent's alternate case. In consequence it
           is extremely difficult to see how it  could  be  said  that  any
           issue of unfairness arose from the Respondent pursuing  such  an
           argument. Either the evidence supplied with the application  met
           the evidential requirements, or it did not. This was not a  case
           in which the Appellant has been able to argue that  the  hearing
           was rendered unfair because he was  denied  the  opportunity  to
           place additional evidence before the Tribunal upon a new issue -
           it is not suggested  that  there  was  any  additional  evidence
           available to him that was relevant to the  question  of  whether
           the evidence supplied with the application  met  the  evidential
           requirements.
       19. I reject as without proper  foundation  the  argument  that  the
           terms of the Respondent's refusal did not permit the alternative
           argument that was pursued. I am satisfied  that  they  did,  and
           that both parties proceeded before the Tribunal on  that  basis,
           as indeed the Judge's record of Mr Marfat's submissions  to  her
           makes clear. Moreover, it is plain that the grant of  permission
           expressly recognised that even if the Appellant could  establish
           that the hearing before the Judge had been rendered unfair  this
           was a hurdle the Appellant would now have to cross,  before  the
           Upper Tribunal would be prepared to remake the decision  in  his
           favour.
       20. It follows that, despite the concern expressed in the  grant  of
           permission to appeal, I am not satisfied that the Judge did take
           for herself a new point in the course of writing  her  decision,
           that was not open to her to take, and  that  had  not  been  the
           subject of argument before her.
       21. In any event, if the failure of some of the deposits to the bank
           account to correspond to  the  sums  recorded  in  the  payslips
           relied upon as the sponsor's net pay, had  genuinely  taken  the
           sponsor and the Appellant's representative by surprise  I  would
           have expected that to have been remarked upon at the  time,  and
           if necessary, for an adjournment to have been sought in order to
           consider the position, even if only for half an hour.  That  was
           not done.
       22. In the circumstances I am not satisfied that the hearing of  the
           Appellant's appeal was in any way rendered unfair. The facts  of
           this case did not raise  an  obligation  upon  the  Tribunal  to
           adjourn the hearing of the appeal of its own motion.
       23. That finding disposes of the appeal. It is  however  appropriate
           given the Appellant's argument before me to deal with a  further
           matter. It is quite clear that the Judge  received  very  little
           assistance from the Appellant's  representative  by  way  of  an
           attempt to schedule, or to calculate, the sums  relied  upon  as
           having been deposited into the  sponsor's  bank  account,  which
           were said to be referable to  the  payslips  relied  upon.  That
           remains the position before me, despite the  clear  warning  set
           out in the grant of permission. Indeed Mr Marfat accepts  before
           me that he has paid no heed to that warning, and that he  offers
           no explanation for that failure. He made no  application  to  me
           for an adjournment, or even for the appeal to be stood down  the
           list temporarily, in order to allow him to perform the necessary
           calculation. I was left with the distinct impression that he did
           not believe that the  performance  of  such  an  exercise  would
           advance the Appellant's case.
       24. I deplore Mr Marfat's suggestion that it is  for  the  Judge  to
           sift through the evidence  provided,  to  try  to  identify  the
           relevant entries in bank statements and payslips,  and  then  to
           perform the  necessary  calculation  to  determine  whether  the
           Appellant has met the requirements of  Appendix  FM  and  FM-SE,
           without any assistance from the parties.  Such  an  approach  is
           redolent of the  worst  type  of  litigation  practice,  and  an
           unwarranted assumption that the resources of  the  Tribunal  are
           unlimited. Both parties are under an obligation  to  assist  the
           Tribunal, although in a situation  such  as  this,  the  primary
           obligation would rest, as would the evidential burden of  proof,
           upon the Appellant.
       25. In all the circumstances of this case I reject  the  Appellant's
           argument that the Judge made any  material  error  of  law  that
           requires her decision to be set aside and remade.


   DECISION


      The Determination of the First Tier Tribunal which was promulgated  on
      12 May 2015 did not involve the making of  an  error  of  law  in  the
      decision to dismiss the appeal that requires that decision to  be  set
      aside and remade. The decision to dismiss the  appeal  is  accordingly
      confirmed.


Direction regarding anonymity - Rule 14 Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008


The Appellant did not seek anonymity before the First Tier Tribunal, and  no
request for anonymity is made to me. There does not appear to  me  to  be  a
proper basis for the Upper Tribunal to make such  a  direction  of  its  own
motion.
