Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Chipperfield (18/07/2014) and Ms B E Jones
                  (25/09/2014) (instructed by A & P Solicitors)
   For the Respondent:   Mr C Avery (18/07/2014) and  Mr P Duffy
                  (25/09/2014) (Senior Home Office Presenting Officers)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  with  permission,  by  the
    Respondent with regard to a determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Andonian) promulgated on 9th May 2014.

 2. The Appellant, a citizen of Sri Lanka, had sought leave to enter the UK
    as a spouse under the provisions of  Appendix  FM  to  the  Immigration
    Rules. That application was refused by the Entry Clearance Officer in a
    decision dated 8th May 2013. The reason for  refusal  was  solely  that
    specified evidence had not been provided to show that  the  UK  Sponsor
    had a gross annual income of at least ï¿½18,600.

 3. The refusal listed the documents that must be produced under the  Rules
    and stated that the letter  from  the  Sponsor's  employer  (Buckingham
    Foods) did not provide his gross annual salary or the period over which
    he  had  been  paid  that  salary  and  therefore  did  not  meet   the
    requirements the Rules.  The  second  issue  was  that  the  sponsoring
    husband also received an additional income from another employer, Senna
    Stores and while there was a letter from that  company  which  met  the
    requirements of the Rules, the Sponsor's bank account did not show  any
    deposits equivalent or roughly equivalent to that pay. In  the  absence
    of any explanation being given in that regard the Rules required income
    to be shown to have been paid into a bank account.

 4. The Appellant appealed  and  the  appeal  came  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, Judge Andonian, sitting at Taylor House on 20th  April  2014.
    In his determination he found that the Appellant was employed by  Senna
    Stores who paid him in cash and  that  the  Rules  were  artificial  in
    requiring payment to be reflected through  a  bank  account.  He  heard
    evidence from the Sponsor and finding that the Sponsor's annual  income
    exceeded the amount required by the Rules he allowed the  appeal  under
    the Rules.

 5. The Entry Clearance Officer sought and was granted permission to appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal. In the grounds the Entry Clearance Officer  said
    that the specified evidence is comprehensively set out in Appendix  FM-
    SE to the Immigration Rules and those set  out  the  evidence  that  is
    required, the period that evidence has to cover and the format that  it
    should be in.  The grounds assert that the First-tier Tribunal  had  no
    regard to that at paragraph 9 of the determination where  it  sets  out
    its findings. The grounds acknowledge that while some documentation had
    been submitted, it did not meet the requirements set out in appendix FM-
    SE as set out in the refusal letter. The First-tier Tribunal Judge also
    seems to completely ignore the requirement that income must be shown to
    be paid into a bank account.

 6. The grounds go on to assert that it is not clear from the determination
    what the  Sponsor's  actual  gross  income  was  at  the  date  of  the
    application.

 7. The matter came before me first on 18th July 2014 when I considered the
    error of law question. On that occasion the Entry Clearance Officer was
    represented by Mr Avery who submitted that the Entry Clearance  Officer
    had not been satisfied with the evidence provided to him.  The  Sponsor
    maintains two jobs and money which is paid in cash is not reflected  in
    his bank statements. The specified evidence set out in Appendix  FM  is
    in the Rules and not simply guidance.  Compliance  with  the  Rules  is
    mandatory. At paragraph 9 the  Judge  refers  to  his  opinion  on  the
    requirement for salaries to be reflected in  bank  statements  but  his
    opinion is immaterial to the matter to be determined.

 8. On the Appellant's behalf Mr Chipperfield submitted that the Judge  had
    to consider the primary requirement of the Rules (that the couple could
    maintain  themselves)  not  the  evidential  requirements.  The   Judge
    identified the evidence that satisfies the primary requirement.

 9.  There  were  two  issues  before  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  that
    represented a problem for him; one was the letter from Buckingham Foods
    and the other was the bank statements.  I  indicated  that  whilst,  if
    satisfied from the other specified evidence that a person was genuinely
    an employee who is paid in cash and is paying tax on that income  there
    is discretion to excuse  those  monies  being  reflected  in  the  bank
    statements. However, so far as the  letter  from  Buckingham  Foods  is
    concerned, the letter produced to the Entry Clearance Officer  did  not
    meet the requirements of Appendix FM.  It  would  have  been  a  simple
    matter to produce a letter from Buckingham Foods that  did  meet  those
    requirements to the Judge and yet they  did  not.  The  Judge  did  not
    address the evidence in the context of the requirements of Appendix  FM
    and, I agreed with Mr Avery that the Judge appears to have decided  the
    case on the overall picture rather than the requirements of  the  Rules
    and certainly appears to disapply those requirements of the Rules  with
    which he disagreed. In allowing the appeal under the Immigration  Rules
    when clearly the Appellant did not meet the Rules was an error of law.

10. Having expressed my views with regards to the bank statements  and  the
    letter from Buckingham Foods, I  adjourned  the  matter  to  a  resumed
    hearing to give the Appellant's representatives opportunity to  produce
    such a letter from Buckingham Foods and I also indicated that if such a
    letter was not produced on the next  occasion  they  were  unlikely  to
    succeed.

11. The matter then came before us for a resumed hearing on 25th September.
    As indicated on the previous occasion, on the basis that the  specified
    evidence was present to  show  that  the  Appellant  worked  for  Senna
    Stores, payslips were produced, evidence  of  tax  paid  was  produced,
    confirmation from the firm itself that all wages were paid in cash  and
    the evidence of the Sponsor that he used the cash to  pay  for  various
    outgoings directly rather than pay it into his bank, we  accepted  that
    so far as that employment is concerned the Rules are met.  We  accepted
    the Sponsor's explanation for the money not passing  through  his  bank
    account.

12. The other matter is the letter from Buckingham Foods.  The  Appellant's
    representatives attended the hearing with a letter  from  Adelie  Foods
    Group Limited, formally Buckingham Foods, which contained  all  of  the
    specified information required by the Rules.

13. Mr Duffy accepted that the Appellant has  now  produced  the  requisite
    evidence to succeed under the Rules.

14. Having allowed the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on the basis that the First-tier Tribunal  made  an  error  of
    law, in re-deciding the appeal we allow the Appellant's appeal  against
    the Entry Clearance Officer's decision.
