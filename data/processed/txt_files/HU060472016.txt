For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Presenting Officer


                     DECISION BY CONSENT AND DIRECTIONS


Pursuant to Rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
and by the consent of the parties the following order is made:

Upon the parties' agreement that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
promulgated on 26th July 2017 discloses a material error of law, it is
hereby ordered by consent as follows.

The First-tier Tribunal Judge made errors of law in relation to the Grounds
of Appeal as pleaded by the Appellant's representatives in the following
respects:

      a) The Appellant's bundle reflects that the Sponsor's pension from the
         Brigade of Gurkhas was paid to the Appellant as a nominated
         recipient (see [AB/50 - 54]) and therefore the First-tier Tribunal
         Judge erred at paragraph 10 of the decision in stating that there
         was no evidence of the Appellant having access to or an
         authorisation to receive the Sponsor's pension.  Thus, the
         assessment of whether the Appellant was dependent upon the Sponsor
         was incomplete, which affects the assessment of whether the
         Appellant is or is not dependent upon the Sponsor, particularly in
         light of the fact that this is a case concerning the existence of
         family life between an adult son and his parents in the context of
         historic injustice relevant in Gurkha cases and in light of the
         Court of Appeal's decision in Rai v Entry Clearance Officer, New
         Delhi [2017] EWCA Civ 320.

In light of the multi-faceted material error as identified and agreed by
the parties I do not go on to consider the Grounds of Appeal remaining as
pleaded, there being no utility in doing so.

The decision is set aside in its entirety and is remitted to be heard by a
differently constituted bench.

The Appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is therefore allowed.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside for legal error by
consent.

Directions

I make the following directions for the continuation and remitted hearing
that is to shortly follow before the First-tier Tribunal:

The appeal is to be remitted to Taylor House.

A Nepalese interpreter is required.

Two witnesses are to be called according to Counsel's instructions.

The time estimate given is two hours.

I have been asked to make a special direction, which I exceptionally do.  I
direct that this appeal be listed for the first available date before IAC
Taylor House, and be considered for any "short date" where there is a late
adjournment or cancellation, given that the appeal brought is challenging
an initial decision taken by the Entry Clearance Officer as long ago as
29th January 2016 and given that the Sponsor's health is said to be ailing
rapidly, and given that almost three years have passed since the refusal of
entry clearance.

I do not make any anonymity direction as none is required.

I note for the record that it is with regret that I am unable to hear this
matter de novo myself as, notwithstanding that this is not usual practice
employed by the Upper Tribunal for cases which have been set aside in their
entirety, not all the witnesses who gave evidence before the First-tier
Tribunal have attended today and neither did I have the benefit of a
Nepalese interpreter so that the matter could be heard and be remade
without any further delay.
