                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Keane, promulgated on 29 April 2016. Permission to appeal  was  granted
    by First-tier Tribunal Judge Lambert on 12 September 2016.

Anonymity

 2. No direction has been made previously, and there is no reason  for  one
    now

Background

 3. On 11 November 2014, the respondents applied for entry clearance  as  a
    partner and dependent child under Appendix FM of the  Rules.  According
    to the notice of decision dated 21 January 2015 relating to  the  first
    respondent,  the  suitability,  relationship   and   English   language
    requirements of the Rules were met. The financial requirements  of  the
    Rules were said not to be met because the sponsor's annual income  from
    self-employment was only �18,722 whereas a gross income of �22,400  per
    annum was required. The sponsor's income from employment was discounted
    because that employment ended prior to the date of the application. His
    savings were discounted because it was not possible to combine  savings
    with self-employed income. The application of the second respondent was
    refused on eligibility grounds because  his  mother's  application  had
    been  refused  as  well  as  owing  to  not   meeting   the   financial
    requirements. Article 8 ECHR was considered, with the ECO deciding that
    it was open to the sponsor, who was an Algerian national to  return  to
    settle in Algeria.

 4. Notice of appeal was lodged by the respondents on 13 February 2015. The
    grounds of appeal asserted that the sponsor was, until  September  2014
    working part-time and also as self-employed.  Following  that,  he  had
    been working as a  self-employed  barber  in  his  own  premises  since
    October 2014. It was said that his income was "about  �22,721"  at  the
    time the application for entry was made. His projected net profit  from
    self-employment was expected to be �23,000 and  total  income  for  the
    year to 5 April 2015, was expected to be �37,545.

 5. An Entry Clearance Manager reviewed the decisions following the appeals
    being lodged. The  decision  was  maintained.  Reference  was  made  to
    section 1.7 of the Immigration Directorate Instructions on Appendix  FM
    which stated that all sources of income must fall within the  financial
    years relied upon and must still be a source of income at the  time  of
    the application. The ECM also noted that  no  satisfactory  reason  had
    been put forward as to why the sponsor in the United Kingdom was unable
    to travel to Algeria to be with the appellant. There were considered to
    be no exceptional circumstances.

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 6. At the  hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  sponsor  gave
    evidence and denied having ceased salaried employment. He relied on  an
    HMRC tax calculation for the year ending 5 April 2014  which  gave  his
    total income as �22,721. The judge allowed the appeals under the Rules,
    finding that the supporting evidence  before  him  shed  light  on  the
    circumstances appertaining at the time of the decisions in question. He
    was satisfied that the sponsor had, in fact, a gross annual  income  of
    over �24,400 at the time "the decisions" were made.



The grounds of appeal

 7. The grounds of appeal in support of  the  application  argued  firstly,
    that the judge had no regard to the date of application and  had  noted
    that he did not know what this was. Secondly, the judge's  findings  as
    to the sponsor's financial circumstances were unsustainable because  he
    did not know the period which he had to examine and he failed to comply
    with Appendix FM-SE. Thirdly and lastly, the judge failed to apply  the
    Rules relating to Specified Evidence to the case.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis  that  the  grounds  were
    arguable.

 9. The respondent's Rule 24 response, argued that the judge had regard  to
    the provisions of Appendix FM-SE in calculating the relevant period  of
    the sponsor's income. Furthermore, the judge had mentioned the date  of
    application.

The hearing

10. Ms Isherwood submitted that at [10] the judge had reference to evidence
    which post-dated the application. Yet  none  of  the  circumstances  in
    Appendix FM-SE, D, applied in relation to considering  documents  after
    the application was made. The judge had looked at evidence as  at  date
    of hearing, however h(bb) of the Appendix in question made reference to
    last full financial year  prior  to  the  application  being  made.  Ms
    Isherwood took me paragraphs 12A, 13(a), 15(b)(i-iii), 17A  (f),  19(b)
    and (c), as well as the IDI's relating to Appendix  FM  1.7,  regarding
    the sponsor still needing to be  in  employment  at  the  time  of  the
    application if he wished to rely on that income. The sponsor  had  left
    his job prior to the application. The judge did not look at appendix FM-
    SE, the evidence provided and the restrictions, instead  he  took  into
    account evidence not falling within Appendix FM-SE.

11. Mr Emezie argued that the Secretary of State's appeal was hopeless  and
    had no merit. At [1], the judge had noted the date of application. This
    disposed of the first two grounds of appeal, in his view.  Thirdly,  he
    asserted that the judge acknowledged that the  evidence  he  considered
    was not before the ECO and limited his consideration  to  the  evidence
    before the ECO at the time of the decision to refuse  entry  clearance.
    He argued that the appellant provided evidence of income at the hearing
    which predated the application. At this point he was unable to refer me
    to any part of the decision where this was stated. Nor  was  Mr  Emezie
    able to state what evidence was before the ECO. He told  me  that  this
    evidence was in the respondent's bundle which was not before the judge,
    however he maintained that the judge noted all the  evidence.  At  this
    stage, I confirmed that the substantial ECO's bundle shown to me by  Mr
    Emezie was not on  the  IAC  case  file.  Mr  Emezie  argued  that  the
    financial requirements were met, but declined to make any reference  to
    Appendix FM-SE during his submissions, despite encouragement from me to
    do so. Nor was he prepared to address the point raised by the ECM  with
    regard to the reason why the income from salaried  self-employment  was
    disregarded.

Decision on error of law

12. At the end of the hearing, I announced that the judge made  a  material
    error of law in this matter and will give my reasons below.

13. Mr Emezie  immediately  attempted  to  seek  permission  to  appeal.  I
    informed him that there was no right of appeal against a decision  that
    did not dispose of the matter, VOM  (Error  of  law-  when  appealable)
    Nigeria [2016] UKUT 00410 (IAC) applied.

14. Paragraph D of Appendix FM-SE states that only documents submitted with
    the application will be considered by an ECO  and  documents  submitted
    later will only be considered in certain circumstances. It is not being
    argued that those exceptions apply in this case. At [7] the judge finds
    that the sponsor's income "has increased since that statement of  total
    income which the respondent acknowledged as total income on  which  tax
    is due." The income before the ECO amounted to just �18,722 from  self-
    employment as seen in the respondent's tax calculation  for  the  2013-
    2014 year.

15. At [9], the judge  appears  to  have  accepted  that  the  sponsor  was
    entitled to rely on his income from salaried employment of �3,999 which
    would, if this was permitted,  take  the  sponsor's  salary  above  the
    income threshold.

16. At [10], the judge took into consideration the tax calculation for 2014-
    2015 which was calculated by the sponsor's accountant.

17. The judge's findings regarding the sponsor's salaried employment do not
    engage with the ECM's objections. Appendix FM 1.7 of the IDI's at 9.3.6
    states that if income from salaried employment and  self-employment  is
    to be combined, the salaried income "must still be a source  of  income
    at the time of the application." In his witness statement of  22  March
    2016, the sponsor confirms in paragraph 6  that  he  had  stopped  this
    employment before the application for entry clearance.  The  judge  was
    not, on the face of it, entitled to take the salaried  employment  into
    consideration. There was no argument on this point from Mr Emezie.

18. The judge made repeated references to looking at the sponsor's finances
    at the time of the decision rather than at the time of the application.
    The fact of the matter was that At [1] he states that he is limited  to
    consideration of "facts in existence at the date when  the  (ECO)  made
    the decisions to refuse entry clearance. " At [8] he says "I find  that
    at the date when the respondent made the decision to refuse entry;"  at
    [10]  the  judge  found  that  the  recent  documents  "illuminate  the
    circumstances appertaining at the time when  the  respondent  made  the
    decisions under appeal" and later in the same  paragraph  that  he  was
    "satisfied that at the date when  the  ECO  made  the  decisions  under
    appeal" the sponsor had a gross annual income of over �24,400. This was
    an error of approach.  It  may  well  have  been  the  case  that  with
    additional earnings between November 2014 and January 2015, the sponsor
    was able to meet the income requirements, however the respondents  were
    required to meet the financial threshold at the  date  of  application,
    which was more than two months earlier  than  the  date  of  the  ECO's
    decision. Even at the time of the decision, no additional evidence  had
    been provided over and above that submitted with the application.

19. The judge's decision does not adequately explain why he considered  the
    financial  requirements  of  the  Rules  were  met  at  the  time   the
    application was made, which was the relevant time.  Furthermore,  while
    he acknowledges the issues raised on behalf of the ECO/ECM, he does not
    engage with them in his findings. In  fact,  he  makes  no  mention  of
    Appendix FM-SE or to the IDI's in his findings. Lastly, he was not,  in
    an appeal involving Appendix FM, entitled to look  at  post-application
    evidence  and  rely  on  it  to  the  extent  of  concluding  that  the
    requirements of the Rules were met at the time the application was made



20. I decided to remit the appeals to the First-tier Tribunal for rehearing
    owing to the fact that the ECO's bundle had not been served on the  IAC
    as well as owing to the unhelpful content of Mr  Emezie's  submissions,
    in which he refused to engage with the issues.



Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error of on a point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

The appeal is remitted, de novo, to the First-tier Tribunal  to  be  reheard
at Taylor House, with a time estimate of 2 hours by any judge except  First-
tier Tribunal Judge Keane.



Directions

The Secretary of State is to serve its bundle of evidence on the  First-tier
Tribunal within 14 days of this decision.

Dylan Conrad Kreolle Solicitors are to serve on the First-tier  Tribunal,  a
detailed, competently-drafted, skeleton argument  which  addresses  Appendix
FM, Appendix FM-SE and the relevant IDI's and to do so  within  28  days  of
this decision.
