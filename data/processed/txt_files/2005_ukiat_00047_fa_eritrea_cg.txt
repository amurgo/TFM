Appearances: Mr E Fripp of Counsel, instructed  by  Powell  &  Co.  for  the
appellant;   Mr  N  Andrews,  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer,   for   the
respondent




                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. The appellant, who claims  to  be  a  national  of  Ethiopia,  appeals
      against a determination of Adjudicator, Miss  C G  Hamilton,  notified
      on 11 December 2003, dismissing her appeal against  the decision of 25
      June 2002 refusing to grant  asylum  but  granting  limited  leave  to
      remain until 20 June 2004.  Her appeal arose under s.69(3) of the 1999
      Act.  As the Adjudicator's determination was promulgated after 9  June
      2003 our jurisdiction is confined to that of a material error of law.

2.    The appellant claimed to have been born in  Asmara  on  21  June  1986
      when it still formed part of Ethiopia, but to have moved  to  live  in
      Ethiopia when aged one-and-a-half.  Her father had  been  killed  when
      she  was  one  year  old.  She  had  been  told  that  the   Ethiopian
      authorities  had  accused  him  of  being  a  spy  for  the   Eritrean
      Independent Movement. Later on her  mother went missing. She  believed
      the authorities had deported her to Eritrea. Her  aunt  had  also  had
      problems. It was these events which led her aunt to  arrange  for  the
      appellant to depart Ethiopia in May 2002.

3.    The respondent in the refusal letter had found the appellant to  be  a
      national of Eritrea who would be able to return there  in  safety.  At
      the  hearing the appellant disputed this.  She relied on the terms  of
      the  1992 Eritrean Nationality Proclamation (No. 21/1992)  which  sets
      out those who were entitled to Eritrean citizenship by birth. Although
      Article 2(1) of the Proclamation states that:

             "Any person born to a father or mother of Eritrean  origin  in
             Eritrea or abroad is an  Eritrean national by birth.


      Article 2(2) then defines Eritrean origin thus:


             "A person who has 'Eritrean origin'  is  any  person  who  was
             resident in Eritrea in 1933."

4.    Why  the appellant  considered  these  provisions  excluded  her  from
      Eritrean nationality is best set out by quoting from  paragraph  3  of
      the grounds of appeal to the Tribunal:

             'The appellant's account of her background,  the  truthfulness
             of which appears to be accepted   by  [the  Adjudicator],  was
             that she was the child of a father of Eritrean regional origin
             born about 1940 and of a mother of Ethiopian  origin  born  in
             the late 1940s. The  appellant  was  resident  in  what  later
             became the territory of independent Eritrea from birth to  the
             age of 2� years, thereafter living entirely in Ethiopia.'

5.    We note there is  a minor discrepancy  over   the  exact  age  of  the
      appellant when she left Asmara (1� or 2�), but nothing hangs on that.

6.     The  Adjudicator  accepted  that  Article  2(2)  of  the  Nationality
      Proclamation appeared to confine nationality by birth to  those  whose
      parents were of Eritrean origin and who were resident in   Eritrea  in
      1933, but considered that this text had to  be  read  'in  conjunction
      with the clarifications offered by   Mr Tewolde  in  the  Home  Office
      fact finding report' (paragraph 18).

7.     The  Home  Office  IND  report  to  which  she  referred  headed  "7.
      Nationality: Laws and Their Application" does not bear  a  clear  date
      but appears to have been prepared or revised some time  after  October
      2002.   It describes    Tewolde  (full  name  Gebratnsae  Tewolde)  as
      Operations Chief in the Department of Immigration and Nationality  for
      Eritrea, a department responsible  for  all  question  of  immigration
      citizenship, passports and visas. It goes on to state:

           '7.1.2  The  Eritrean  Nationality  Proclamation   No.   21/1992
                 published in April 1992 details the  criteria  and  law  as
                 regarding   Eritrean  Nationality.  Nationality   in   this
                 document is split into  several  sections:  Nationality  by
                 Birth; Naturalisation; Adoption and Marriage.


           7.1.3 According  to  Tewolde,  "many  people  misunderstand  the
                 Nationality Proclamation, this is understandable as we  are
                 a new country and are trying to be as inclusive as possible
                 to all our citizens born in years  of  foreign  domination.
                 Basically if your parents  or  grandparents  were  born  in
                 Eritrea  you  will  certain   be   entitled   to   Eritrean
                 nationality but will have  to  prove  this,  as  you  would
                 anywhere in the world".


           7.1.4  The source further explained that "If  you  are  born  in
                 Eritrean territory [regardless of who it belonged to at the
                 time] then you will also be  eligible.   Many  people  have
                 also returned to Eritrea since independence. They are  very
                 welcome regardless  of  the  circumstances  as  we  try  to
                 rebuild our nation after years of domination and war".


           7.1.5   According  to  the  Nationality  Proclamation,   current
                 Eritrea regard to naturalisation takes the year 1933 as the
                 starting point. This is the  year  in  which  the   Italian
                 colonial government registered the population of the colony
                 and  declared  those   registered   as   legal   residents.
                 Therefore, these persons who  have  an  absolute  right  to
                 Eritrean citizenship are all those who were  themselves  or
                 who are the descendants  of  persons  resident  in  Eritrea
                 prior to 1933.' (emphasis added)

8.    In the light of this information the Adjudicator  was  satisfied  that
      the appellant was entitled to Eritrean nationality by virtue of  being
      a descendant of persons resident in  Eritrea prior to 1933.
[1]9.  This  finding  of   Eritrean  nationality  essentially   caused   the
      Adjudicator  to dismiss the appeal on the strength of the  appellant's
      own acceptance elsewhere that she did not have a well-founded fear  of
      persecution in Eritrea.

10.   The Adjudicator nowhere  addressed  the  appellant's  claims  to  fear
      persecution if returned to  Ethiopia.

11.   At the outset of the hearing Mr Fripp requested an adjournment on  the
      basis that there was a determination imminent  in  a  number  of  test
      cases heard together by a Tribunal chaired by  Vice  President  Mr  J.
      Latter*.  In that determination, he said,  the  Tribunal  was  due  to
      reach conclusions on 'similar points' bearing on the appeal before us.

12.   We refused this request. As we explained to  Mr  Fripp,  although  the
      determination to which he referred had yet to be promulgated,  we  had
      seen it and satisfied ourselves that it did not address or decide  the
      relevant issues in this appeal. We also  bore  in  mind  that  in  the
      appeal before us the  Adjudicator  had  not  addressed  the  issue  of
      whether the appellant  would face risk if returned to   Ethiopia.   So
      far as we were concerned, the only issue in this  appeal  was  whether
      the Adjudicator had erred in law in concluding that the appellant  was
      a national of Eritrea. If it was accepted there  was  no  such  error,
      then the appeal would have to fail, since the  appellant  herself  did
      not claim to face a real risk of serious harm in  Eritrea.  If however
      we accepted there was such an error, then we would remit  the  appeal,
      so that an Adjudicator could make findings on  whether  the  appellant
      would face a real  risk  of  persecution  if  returned  to   Ethiopia,
      whether as a national of Ethiopia or  as  a  stateless  person  having
      Ethiopia as her (evident) country of former habitual residence.

13.   We should also mention  at  this  stage  that  Mr  Fripp  referred  at
      several points to material (e.g. an Amnesty International  Report  May
      2004) that were not before the Adjudicator. However, as we pointed out
      to him, the Court of Appeal  judgment  in  CA  [2004]  EWCA  Civ  1165
      prevented taking post-promulgation materials into account unless there
      was a material error of law.  Furthermore, such material had not  been
      submitted  in accordance with  Tribunal directions in  this  case.  We
      were prepared because of apparent overlap  to  consider  his  skeleton
      argument  drafted  for  the  appeals  in  the  cases  shortly  to   be
      promulgated by Mr Latter, but we did not consider we could  or  should
      admit any further evidence not properly served.

14.   We notice that in deciding this case the Adjudicator did not cite  any
       court or Tribunal  authorities  dealing  with  nationality.  That  is
      unfortunate in that it has meant having to  piece  together  what  her
      approach was.  However, it is clear that the materials  placed  before
      her included a number of leading cases. We  can  only  identify  legal
      error on her part if satisfied she applied erroneous legal principles.

15.   We shall not set out Mr Fripp's submissions strictly in the  order  he
      did, since his oral submissions digressed from  his  written  grounds,
      taking in points (with our leave) from the skeleton  argument  already
      mentioned.  But the following summary is intended to capture  what  we
      take to be his principal points.

16.   Firstly, he  submitted  that  the  Adjudicator   had  made  a  finding
      contrary  to  a  plain  reading  of  the  1992  Eritrean   Nationality
      Proclamation. Properly construed, he said,  the latter  excluded  both
      of the appellant's parents from the  category  of  those  entitled  to
      citizenship by birth to a father or mother of  Eritrean  origin,  they
      being born after 1933.  This  was  an  error,  he  said,  because  his
      reasoning effectively treated the  Proclamation as having no weight at
      all as evidence of Eritrean  nationality entitlement.

17.   Mr Fripp's second submission is difficult to discern  in  his  written
      grounds, but we are prepared to treat these as raising it  implicitly.
      As amplified by him, it was that the Adjudicator was wrong  to  accept
      the Home  Office  report  'clarification'  as  a  reliable  source  of
      evidence as to how Eritrean nationality  law  was  understood  by  the
      Eritrean authorities. He pointed out that  paragraph  7.8.11  of  this
      report quoted  a  certain  Paulos  Kahsay,  Director  General  at  the
      Ministry of Transport and  Communications  as  representing  that  the
      group of persons deported by Malta to Eritrea in late  2002  were  not
      detained, something which had since been  demonstrated  to  be  false.
      The  need  for  caution  in  placing  reliance   on   assertions   and
      representations made by  Eritrean officials, whether Mr Tewolde,   the
      Ambassador at the  Eritrean Embassy  in  London,  or  Mr  Kahsay,  was
      reinforced, said Mr Fripp, by what was objectively demonstrated by  US
      State Department Reports, namely that the current  regime  in  Eritrea
      was responsible  for  numerous  human  rights  abuses  and  marked  by
      arbitrariness. Hence what was claimed by government officials was  not
      to be taken at face value.

18.   The third main ground relied on by Mr Fripp was that  the  Adjudicator
      had wrongly failed to consider 'substantial obstacles to an  effective
      extension of Eritrean nationality to [the appellant] as opposed  to  a
      notional future claim'.  The first aspect of this failure was said  to
      be her erroneous assumption that a future grant of  nationality  by  a
      state where an individual does not already have a concrete entitlement
      satisfies the requirements  of  the  Refugee  Convention.  The  second
      aspect of this failure was, he said, her failure to recognise that the
      Home Office report itself indicated that in any  event  the  appellant
      would not be able to prove her entitlement to  Eritrean nationality on
      the tests identified by Eritrean officials.  The  Home  Office  report
      depicted those officials  as  viewing   Eritrean  nationality  in  the
      context  of  being  able  to  demonstrate   association   with   other
      Eritreans, 'the practical embodiment of which is  the  requirement  to
      produce  three  recognised   Eritrean  citizens  to  an   individual's
      origins'. In particular Mr Fripp dwelt on what was quoted in paragraph
      7.2.8 as being said by  Ghimnal Ghebremanon,  Ambassador,  Embassy  of
      the  State of Eritrea, London:

             '... His view is that these witnesses should not be hard [sic]
             to provide as a proof of nationality 'they will be  in  groups
             of other Eritreans, if Eritrean is what they are.  So  proving
             Eritrean nationality is easy. Much more so than for a  British
             or American citizen.'

19.   This, said Mr Fripp, effectively reduced the test applied  in  respect
      of  Eritrean nationality to one of community  association  with  other
      Eritreans. Such a test was not an objective or properly  legal one and
      so was bound to have arbitrary effects in practice.  Even if the  test
      itself had legal efficacy, it could not avail this  appellant  because
      her father was dead, her mother was missing, and she herself had  left
      Asmara when only  1� years old.

Evaluation and Conclusions
20.   We are not persuaded by Mr Fripp's first ground. The  Adjudicator  did
      not fail to attach weight to the  1992 Nationality  Proclamation.  She
      simply had recourse,  in  deciding  what  it  meant  in  practice,  to
      supplementary  sources.  We  would  accept  that  on  the   rules   of
      construction familiar to an  English lawyer, those covered by  Article
      2(1) appear restricted by  Article 2(2) to  persons  born  in  Eritrea
      having parents of  Eritrean ethnic origin themselves resident there in
      1933.  But the Home Office  report, on which the  Adjudicator  relied,
      simply reflected a proper recognition that in considering questions of
      entitlement  to the nationality of a foreign state, it is necessary to
      have regard to both law and practice in that state. Such  an  approach
      also reflects the essential principle of international law, as set out
      for example in  Articles 1 and 2 of the   1930 Hague  Convention  that



                 '1930 Hague Convention on Certain Questions
                Relating to the Conflict of Nationality Laws


                                  Article 1


         It is for each State to determine under its own  law  who  are  its
         nationals.  This law shall be recognised by other States in so  far
         as it is consistent with international  conventions,  international
         custom, and the principles of law generally recognised with  regard
         to nationality ...


                                  Article 2


         Any question as to whether a person possesses the nationality of  a
         particular State shall be determined in accordance with the law  of
         that State.'

21.   Thus the Adjudicator did not prefer the  Home  Office  report  to  the
      test of the Proclamation; rather she simply used the  former  to  cast
      light on how the latter was interpreted and applied by the authorities
      of the state in question. Plainly  Eritrean  authorities  favoured  an
      'inclusive' interpretation. We would add that in considering the  1992
      Proclamation in this way, she adopted an approach wholly in line  with
      that taken by the Court of Appeal in Zaid Tecle [2002] EWCA  Civ  1358
      and the Tribunal in cases such as  YL  (Nationality,  Statelessness  -
      Eritrea  -  Ethiopia)  Eritrea  CG  [2004]  UKIAT  00016  (formerly  L
      (Ethiopia) [2003] UKIAT 00016).   (Indeed, if we understood Mr Fripp's
      own remarks correctly, his own position was that the   legal  text  in
      this case  (the  1992  Proclamation)  could  not  safely  be  read  in
      isolation from legal practice since two expert reports  known  to  him
      from other cases had concluded that matters came down very largely  to
      'executive fiat').  Moreover, in our view there was a  further  reason
      for looking behind the bare text of the  1992 Proclamation,  at  least
      in the form of the translation placed before the Adjudicator. If taken
      literally it was  a provision which within a relatively  short  period
      of (generational) time would prevent anyone being able to qualify  for
      Eritrean nationality on the grounds of  a  combination  of  birth  and
      parentage. The youngest parent now covered, for example would have  to
      be no less than seventy-one years old.  Such a reading  defied  common
      sense.

22.   Turning to Mr Fripp's second ground, we would  observe  first  of  all
      that the Home Office report was primarily a summary  of  the  evidence
      available regarding  Eritrean nationality law drawn from a  number  of
      sources. For reasons already given, one  would  expect  it  to  accord
      prominence to evidence as to determination and  application  given  by
      Eritrean officials, but the  nine page report  also  draws  on   a  US
      State Department Report, a report by  Dr Gilkes and materials provided
      by a number of international organisations including UNHCR,  ICRC  and
      ERREC.

23.   Mr Fripp has asserted that the report should have  been  treated  with
      much more caution than it was,  at least to the  extent that it relied
      on statement by  Eritrean officials.    We can readily accept that how
      much weight  should  be  attached  to  statements  by  the  government
      officials of a particular country will vary depending on a  number  of
      factors, including the extent to  which  the  government  in  question
      complies  or  does  not  comply  with   international   human   rights
      guarantees. But there was nothing placed before the Adjudicator by  Mr
      Fripp (who also represented the appellant below) to show that what was
      said about Eritrean nationality law  and  practice  by  the  officials
      cited was false. Even if the Adjudicator had known that what was  said
      by Mr Kahsay about the returnees from Malta was false,  that  was  not
      enough on its own to cause him to attach less weight to what  said  by
      Mr Tewolde or by the  Eritrean Ambassador in relation to  an  entirely
      different issue.

24.   The third ground in its first limb highlighted a point  which,  as  Mr
      Fripp conceded, has been raised by him in a number of previous  cases.
      It  encapsulates  what  might  be  termed  the  'present  nationality'
      approach. However, as Mr  Fripp should well know,  that  approach  has
      been consistently and emphatically rejected in  leading  cases  before
      the Court of  Appeal  and  the  Tribunal.   This  proper  approach  to
      nationality determination has been set  out  in  some  detail  by  the
      Tribunal in the  YL case  as follows:

           '44.  Since it is common ground that the appellant is not as yet
              recognised as a national of Eritrea, it may be asked, why  is
              it legitimate to even consider whether she is a  national  of
              Eritrea? Fortunately in order to answer this question  we  do
              not need to embark on an  analysis  of  the  complexities  of
              nationality law. That is because, following  Bradshaw  [1994]
              IMM AR 359, we consider it settled law  that  when  a  person
              does not accept that the Secretary of State is correct  about
              his nationality, it is incumbent on him to prove it, if  need
              be by making an application for such nationality. That is all
              the more necessary in the case of someone claiming  to  be  a
              refugee under the Refugee Convention.  Under that Convention,
              establishing nationality (or statelessness) cannot be left as
              something that is optional for the claimant.  The  burden  of
              proof is on the claimant to prove his nationality (or lack of
              it).  To leave it as an optional matter would  also  make  it
              possible for bogus claimants to  benefit  from  international
              protection  even though in law  they  had  nationality  of  a
              country where they would not be  at  risk  of  persecution  -
              simply by not applying  for  that  nationality.  Furthermore,
              leaving it as an optional  matter  would  render  unnecessary
              provisions of the definition in Article 1A(2) which require a
              person to be  outside  the  country  of  his  nationality  or
              outside the country of  his  former  habitual  residence  and
              which place special conditions on persons who have more  than
              one nationality. As was said by  Rothstein J in the  Canadian
              Federal  Court  case  of  Tatiana  Bouianova  v  Minister  of
              Employment and Immigration [1993] FCJ No 576, a case  dealing
              with  statelessness,  "[t]he   definition   should   not   be
              interpreted in such a manner as to render some of  its  words
              unnecessary or redundant."


           45.  Bearing in mind that the  burden  of  proof  rests  on  the
              claimant, it is always relevant  to  enquire  in  such  cases
              whether a person has taken steps to apply for the nationality
              of the country in question or,  if  they  have  taken  steps,
              whether they have been successful or unsuccessful.


           46.   We  would  accept  that  in  asylum  cases  the   Bradshaw
              principle has to be qualified  to  take  account  of  whether
              there are valid reasons for a claimant not approaching his or
              her embassy or consulate - or the authorities of the  country
              direct - about an application for citizenship  or  residence.
              In some cases such an approach could place  the  claimant  or
              the claimant's family at risk, because for example  it  would
              alert the  authorities to the fact the claimant  has  escaped
              pursuit by  fleeing the  country.  However, by no  means  can
              there be a blanket assumption that  for  all  claimants  such
              approaches would create or increase risk.  It is a matter  to
              be examined on the evidence in any particular case. The  1979
              UNHCR Handbook does not require a different  position  to  be
              taken:  paragraph  93  clearly  contemplates  a  case-by-case
              approach.


           47. As noted earlier, we now have the judgment in the  Court  of
              Appeal  in Zaid Tecle [2002]EWCA  Civ  1358  published  on  6
              September 2002 as well as Mrs  Cronin's submissions on it. We
              note that what it says about nationality  in  relation  to  a
              claimant who was also born in Asmara with an Eritrean father,
              supports the view we have taken here. Brooke, LJ,  stated  at
              paragraph 23:


                  "In my judgment,  given  the  material  from  the  British
                  Embassy which was before the Adjudicator and the  Tribunal
                  in this case, the Tribunal was entitled, having regard  to
                  that and having regard to the  CIPU  Report,  to  take  an
                  adverse view of the fact that the appellant, on  whom  the
                  burden of proof  lay,  had  not  contacted  the   Eritrean
                  Embassy in London and made an  application,  supported  by
                  three appropriate witnesses, for citizenship."'

25.   No doubt in recognition of the fact that legal authority  was  against
      him, Mr Fripp's submission sought to rely on a fall-back  argument  at
      this point.  Even if it is right  to  take  a  'putative  nationality'
      approach in some cases, he contended, this was  only  valid  when  the
      recognised or underlying nationality was an accessible  and  effective
      one. In the  Canadian case of Bouianova v  MEI  [1993]   FCJ  576  the
      applicant was a citizen of Russia by birth. He was merely  asking  for
      recognition of a pre-existing status based on the operation of Russian
      law and an application  to the  Russian Consulate.  Recognition  of  a
      person in this type of situation as a national (of Russia) made sense.
      But that was because there were  minimal  procedural  steps  involved.
      Thus, argued Mr Fripp, Bouvianova principles should only apply to  the
      situation of a person who in order to have citizenship conferred would
      have to undertake  'equivalent minimal procedural steps'.

26.    We  think  this  submission  goes  too  far.    In  YL  the  Tribunal
      identified the proper test as one of serious obstacles.  Mr  Fripp  on
      the other hand advocated a test that would  virtually  require  access
      which was obstacle-free. To reduce it thus would mean that a  claimant
      could avoid by choice being recognised as a national  of  his  country
      whenever the procedure for applying and obtaining  nationality was not
      wholly straightforward.  He would not have to exercise due  diligence.
      Such a test would place the decision as to nationality in the  control
      of the claimant and so give him an  ability  in  certain  contexts  to
      manipulate his nationality  (or  lack  of  it)  in  order  to  achieve
      recognition  as  a  refugee.  But  that  would  be  to  undermine  the
      foundation principle of surrogate  protection.    (We  note  that  our
      approach  also  accords  with  that  contained  in  Council  Directive
      2004/83/EC  on minimum standards for the qualification and  status  of
      third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees who otherwise
      need international protection (the Qualification Directive)  which  at
      Article 4(3)(e) requires assessment of an  individual  application  to
      take into account, inter alia: "whether the applicant could reasonably
      be expected to avail himself of  the  protection  of  another  country
      where he could assert citizenship".)

27.   As regards Mr Fripp's reliance on a test  of  "effective  nationality"
      as identified by Tamberlin J in the  Australian case, Jong Kim  Koe  v
      MIMA [1997] 306 FCA, that was concerned with  a situation of a  person
      with more than one nationality. For reasons already explained, that is
      not the issue we have before us in the context of this appeal.

28.   Mr  Fripp's next point under this head was that  the  Adjudicator  was
      wrong to consider it reasonably likely the appellant would be accepted
      as  Eritrean by the  Eritrean authorities since the Home Office report
      in its description of the three witnesses test applied by the Eritrean
      authorities made clear that only those who had a community association
      with other Eritreans could surmount it.

29.   The significance of the  three  witnesses  test  has  previously  been
      considered by the Court of Appeal in Zaid Tecle and by the Tribunal in
      YL and other cases.  What underlines these decisions is the view  that
      a claimant should be expected to use due diligence in respect of  such
      a test. It is true that in this case the appellant's parents were dead
      and missing and that she herself was unlikely to have  been  known  as
      someone who had resided in Asmara, since she left there when   1�  (or
      2�)  years old. However, as accurately reflected in the   comments  of
      the Eritrean Ambassador in London, there is an  Eritrean community  in
      the UK (which is part of a larger Eritrean disapora abroad). As  noted
      at paragraph 7.2.7, 'It is a matter of history  that those in Ethiopia
      kept close contact with family in Eritrea, even those that  stayed  in
      Ethiopia after independence'.  There was no evidence to  suggest  that
      the appellant in this case had isolated herself from  other  Eritreans
      in the UK or that fellow Eritreans here would not  include  those  who
      knew directly of her own family history.

30.   As for  Mr  Fripp's  contention  that  the  statements  from  Eritrean
      officials disclosed a nationality law and practice  lacking  any  real
      objective criteria, we fail to see that this is  demonstrated  by  the
      Home  Office  report  or  any  other  evidence   placed   before   the
      Adjudicator.  It  may  be  that   the   Eritrean  nationality  law  is
      sometimes misapplied or not applied in some instances, but  there  are
      identifiable criteria which appear roughly comparable with nationality
      tests in a  number of other countries and which have not been seen  by
      courts or tribunals n this country to lack sufficient  objectivity  as
      tests in this type of subject area.  There is no evidence before us of
      a consistent pattern of abuse of these criteria by Eritrean officials,
      or of commonplace but random abuse.

31.   Accordingly, we do not think that the Adjudicator erred in finding  it
      reasonably likely, by virtue of her parentage  and  birth  in  Asmara,
      that  this  appellant  was,  or  should   be  considered  for  Refugee
      Convention purposes, to be a national of Eritrea.

32.   For the above reasons this appeal is dismissed.  It is  reported   for
      what we say about nationality in general and  Eritrean nationality  in
      particular.

                                 H.H. STOREY
