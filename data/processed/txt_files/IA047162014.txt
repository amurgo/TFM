Solicitors)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    Introduction

    1.     The Appellant (the Secretary of State) appealed with  permission
         granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Lever  on  31  December  2014
         against the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge R  L  Walker
         who had allowed the Respondent's  appeal  against  refusal  of  his
         application to remain as the spouse  of  a  British  Citizen  under
         Appendix FM in a decision and reasons  promulgated  on  7  November
         2014.

    2.     The Respondent is a national of  Pakistan,  born  on  1  January
         1988.  His immigration history is set out at [2] of Judge  Walker's
         decision.  There had been a dispute as to whether or not he  had  a
         valid in time appeal to the First-tier Tribunal but as Judge Walker
         had noted that issue had been resolved in the  Respondent's  favour
         by Upper Tribunal Judge Renton: see [21] of the decision.

    3.     Permission to appeal was granted because it was considered  that
         it was arguable that the judge had erred in law by failing to  make
         any findings as to whether or not  the  financial  requirements  of
         Appendix FM had been satisfied.

    4.     Standard directions were made by the tribunal,  indicating  that
         the appeal would be reheard immediately if a material error of  law
         were found.

    Submissions - error of law

    5.     Mr Duffy for the Appellant relied on the grounds of  onwards  of
         appeal and the grant of permission to appeal.   He  submitted  that
         there  remained  an  underlying  issue   as   to   the   tribunal's
         jurisdiction, although he accepted that this had not been raised in
         any clear terms before the judge.  There was no  reference  in  the
         decision to the financial requirements of Appendix FM  and  so  the
         decision could not stand in any event.

    6.     Mr Plowright for the Respondent  submitted  that  the  sponsor's
         financial ability had never been in issue.  The specified  evidence
         had been produced with the Respondent's application and that showed
         that the required amount of ï¿½18,600 per year had  been  comfortably
         exceeded.  It  simply  had  not  been  an  issue.   The  tribunal's
         jurisdiction had been resolved by Upper Tribunal Judge  Renton  and
         was similarly not an issue before Judge Walker.

    7.     The tribunal indicated at the conclusion of submissions that  it
         found no material error of  law  in  Judge  Walker's  decision  and
         reserved its determination which now follows.

    No material error of law finding

    8.     It may be that the Secretary of State  has  access  to  material
         which called the First-tier Tribunal's jurisdiction into  question,
         but the time to have produced such material was in advance  of  the
         hearing before Judge Walker,  in  accordance  with  the  tribunal's
         standard directions.  There had evidently been some confusion  over
         the Respondent's Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant  leave,  but  the
         judge's record of proceedings shows that no submissions  were  made
         on that point to him.  It had thus been accepted by  the  Secretary
         of State that the First-tier  Tribunal  had  jurisdiction.   It  is
         hence far too late  for  any  new  material  to  be  introduced  on
         jurisdictional issues, without any proper explanation for the delay
         and when it appears that any such evidence was in the Secretary  of
         State's possession at all material times.  The Secretary  of  State
         had the option at the First-tier Tribunal stage of withdrawing  her
         decision in the light of Upper Tribunal Judge Renton's  ruling,  or
         indeed to challenge Upper Tribunal Judge Renton's ruling, but chose
         not to do so.  It would be  procedurally  unfair  to  entertain  an
         attempt to reopen that now.  Plainly Judge Walker was  entitled  to
         proceed as he did.

    9.     As to the financial  requirements  of  Appendix  FM,  again  the
         judge's record of proceedings shows that no submissions  were  made
         on the point.  The decision and  reasons  reflects  that.   It  was
         accepted before Judge Walker that the Respondent's sponsor had  met
         the financial requirements.  There was no need for the judge to say
         so.  Unfortunately the permission to appeal application  must  have
         been made without access to the appeal file.   So  again  there  is
         nothing in the point.

    10.    The tribunal accordingly finds that there was no material  error
         of law in the decision and  reasons  and  there  is  no  basis  for
         interfering with the judge's decision.

    DECISION

    The making of the previous decision did not involve  the  making  of  a
    material error on a point of law and stands unchanged

    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Manuell
