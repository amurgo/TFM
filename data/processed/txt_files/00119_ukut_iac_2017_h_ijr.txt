                              (9 February 2017)


A proper reading of the Upper Tribunal's  decision  in  AA  (Article  15(c))
Iraq CG [2015] UKUT 00544 (IAC) reveals the importance  of  making  findings
of fact regarding P's circumstances, in order properly to apply the  country
guidance in that case. A finding that P cannot currently be returned,  owing
to a lack of particular travel documentation, will not be  determinative  of
P's claim to international protection if P faces  a  real  risk  of  serious
harm, otherwise than (solely) by reason of P's lack of such documentation.

JUDGE PETER LANE:


Introduction

1.   The applicant, a citizen of Iraq who  seeks  international  protection,
    challenges the respondent's decision of 10  March  2016  to  refuse  to
    accept the applicant's  submissions  as  a  fresh  claim,  pursuant  to
    paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules.  Permission was granted on  the
    papers on 29 July 2016 by Upper Tribunal Judge McGeachy.  Following the
    grant, the respondent produced, on 16 November 2016, a further decision
    letter in respect of the applicant, which the respondent  describes  as
    supplementary to, and which is to be read together with,  the  decision
    letter of 10 March.

Immigration history

2.   The immigration history of the applicant  is  essentially  as  follows.
    He says he was born in 1992 in Mosul.  He entered  the  United  Kingdom
    illegally in 2008, when he was aged 16.  He sought asylum shortly after
    entry.  On 10 November 2008, the  respondent  refused  the  applicant's
    asylum claim but granted him discretionary leave  to  remain  until  28
    February 2010 (that is to say, until the applicant reached the  age  of
    17� years).

3.   On 24 February 2010, the applicant  made  an  application  for  further
    leave  to  remain.   Following  the  respondent's   refusal   of   that
    application, the applicant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  On  17
    June 2010, the First-tier Tribunal dismissed his appeal.  The applicant
    became appeal rights exhausted in respect of the refusal of  May  2010,
    when the Upper Tribunal refused permission to appeal.

4.   On 26 March  2014,  the  applicant  made  further  submissions  to  the
    respondent.  She refused to treat them as a fresh  claim  and  judicial
    review proceedings were commenced by the applicant.  On 2 October 2015,
    the respondent agreed to reconsider the applicant's submissions.  On 10
    March 2016, however, the respondent refused to  treat  the  applicant's
    further submissions (including those made on  15  October  2015)  as  a
    fresh claim.  That refusal gave rise to the present proceedings.

5.    Immigration  Judge  A  D   Baker's   determination,   dismissing   the
    applicant's appeal, records that the applicant boarded a lorry  in  his
    home village in Iraq about seven days before his arrival in the  United
    Kingdom.  The applicant remained in the lorry, being allowed out of  it
    only at night.  The applicant's case was that  he  never  had  his  own
    national passport and used no documents to  enter  the  United  Kingdom
    clandestinely, leaving his national identity card in Iraq.

6.   The applicant's claimed age was accepted by the respondent,  who  found
    that he had told the truth about this matter.  Neither  the  respondent
    nor the judge, however, accepted the applicant's account of the  events
    that caused him to leave Iraq.  The applicant said that  he  had  heard
    his father had been shot and that the applicant had difficulties with a
    terrorist group.  The applicant refused to join that group, as a result
    of which he was beaten.  He was later threatened with death if  he  did
    not join the group.  Family members arranged for the applicant to leave
    Iraq in the lorry.

7.   So far as international protection was concerned, the  judge  concluded
    as follows:-

         "31. I find that this appellant  has  told  an  untruthful  account
             which has been caught out in cross-examination.  I  find  that
             this is a fictitious account of his claimed history.

         32.  I find that this appellant is a fit  young  man  who  when  18
             years in August will be able to relocate  in  Iraq  either  by
             living in Baghdad if transported there on return or  make  his
             way from Baghdad to Mosul to rejoin his uncle and  mother  and
             extended family.  I find that he has given one true account of
             the circumstances that prompted him  allegedly  to  enter  the
             United Kingdom".




The country guidance in AA (Iraq)

8.   Of key significance in the present proceedings is the country  guidance
    case of the Upper Tribunal in AA (Article 15(c)) Iraq  CG  [2015]  UKUT
    00544 (IAC).  AA was heard on 18 and 19 May 2015 and the  decision  was
    promulgated on 30 October 2015.  The Tribunal found  that  a  state  of
    internal armed conflict,  such  as  to  engage  Article  15(c)  of  the
    Qualification Directive, existed in  certain  parts  of  Iraq.   It  is
    common ground that these include the present applicant's home area.  It
    is also common ground that, for the purposes of these proceedings, such
    a state of internal armed conflict continues  in  that  home  area  and
    that, as a result, the applicant cannot return to his home in Iraq.

9.    The  remaining  parts  of  the  country   guidance   in   AA   concern
    documentation and feasibility of return; the position of  documentation
    where return is feasible; internal  relocation  within  Iraq;  and  the
    possibility of return to the Iraqi Kurdish region (IKR).

10.  The country guidance on these matters is as follows:-

         "B. DOCUMENTATION AND FEASIBILITY OF RETURN (excluding IKR)

         5.   Return of former residents of the Iraqi Kurdish  Region  (IKR)
             will be to the IKR and all other Iraqis will  be  to  Baghdad.
             The Iraqi authorities will allow an Iraqi national (P) in  the
             United Kingdom to enter Iraq only if P is in possession  of  a
             current or expired Iraqi passport relating to P, or a  laissez
             passer.

         6.    No Iraqi national will be returnable to  Baghdad  if  not  in
             possession of one of these documents.

         7.    In the light of the Court of Appeal's judgment in  HF  (Iraq)
             and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013]
             EWCA Civ 1276, an international protection  claim  made  by  P
             cannot succeed by  reference  to  any  alleged  risk  of  harm
             arising from an absence of Iraqi identification documentation,
             if the  Tribunal  finds  that  P's  return  is  not  currently
             feasible,  given  what  is  known  about  the  state  of   P's
             documentation.

          C. POSITION ON DOCUMENTATION WHERE RETURN IS FEASIBLE

         8.   It will only be where  the  Tribunal  is  satisfied  that  the
             return of P to Iraq is feasible that the issue of alleged risk
             of harm  arising  from  an  absence  of  Iraqi  identification
             documentation will require judicial determination.

         9.   Having a Civil Status Identity Document (CSID) is one  of  the
             ways in which it is possible for  an  Iraqi  national  in  the
             United Kingdom to obtain a passport or a laissez passer. Where
             the Secretary of State proposes to remove  P  by  means  of  a
             passport  or  laissez  passer,  she  will   be   expected   to
             demonstrate to  the  Tribunal  what,  if  any,  identification
             documentation led the Iraqi authorities to issue  P  with  the
             passport or laissez passer (or to signal their intention to do
             so).

         10.   Where P is returned to Iraq on a laissez  passer  or  expired
             passport, P will be at no risk of serious harm at the point of
             return by reason of not having a  current  passport  or  other
             current form of Iraqi identification document.

         11.   Where P's return to Iraq is  found  by  the  Tribunal  to  be
             feasible, it will generally be necessary to decide  whether  P
             has a CSID, or will be able to  obtain  one,  reasonably  soon
             after arrival in Iraq. A CSID is generally required  in  order
             for  an  Iraqi  to  access  financial  assistance   from   the
             authorities;  employment;  education;  housing;  and   medical
             treatment. If P shows there are no  family  or  other  members
             likely to be able to provide means of support, P is in general
             likely to face  a  real  risk  of  destitution,  amounting  to
             serious harm, if, by the time any funds provided to P  by  the
             Secretary of State or her agents to  assist  P's  return  have
             been exhausted, it is reasonably likely that P will still have
             no CSID.

         12.   Where return is feasible but P does not have a CSID, P should
             as a general matter be able  to  obtain  one  from  the  Civil
             Status Affairs Office for P's home Governorate, using an Iraqi
             passport (whether current or expired), if P has one. If P does
             not have such a passport, P's ability to  obtain  a  CSID  may
             depend on whether P knows the page and volume  number  of  the
             book holding P's information (and that  of  P's  family).  P's
             ability to persuade the officials that P is the  person  named
             on the relevant page is likely to  depend  on  whether  P  has
             family members or other individuals who are prepared to  vouch
             for P.

         13.   P's ability to  obtain  a  CSID  is  likely  to  be  severely
             hampered if P is unable to go  to  the  Civil  Status  Affairs
             Office of P's Governorate because  it  is  in  an  area  where
             Article 15(c) serious harm is occurring. As a  result  of  the
             violence,  alternative  CSA  Offices  for  Mosul,  Anbar   and
             Saluhaddin have been established in Baghdad and  Kerbala.  The
             evidence does not  demonstrate  that  the  "Central  Archive",
             which exists in Baghdad, is in practice able to provide  CSIDs
             to those in need of them. There is, however, a National Status
             Court  in  Baghdad,  to  which  P  could  apply   for   formal
             recognition of identity. The precise operation of  this  court
             is, however, unclear.

         D. INTERNAL RELOCATION WITHIN IRAQ (OTHER THAN  THE  IRAQI  KURDISH
         REGION)

         14.  As a general matter, it will not  be  unreasonable  or  unduly
             harsh for a person  from  a  contested  area  to  relocate  to
             Baghdad City or (subject to paragraph  2  above)  the  Baghdad
             Belts.

         15.   In assessing whether it would  be  unreasonable/unduly  harsh
             for P to relocate  to  Baghdad,  the  following  factors  are,
             however, likely to be relevant:

              (a) whether P has a CSID or will be able to  obtain  one  (see
                  Part C above);

              (b) whether P can speak Arabic  (those  who  cannot  are  less
                  likely to find employment);

              (c) whether P has family members or friends in Baghdad able to
                  accommodate him;

               (d)   whether  P  is  a  lone  female  (women  face   greater
                  difficulties than men in finding employment);

              (e)  whether P can find a sponsor to access a  hotel  room  or
                  rent accommodation;

              (f)  whether P is from a minority community;

              (g) whether there is support available for P bearing  in  mind
                  there is some evidence that returned failed asylum seekers
                  are provided with the support generally given to IDPs.

         16.  There is not a real risk of an  ordinary  civilian  travelling
             from Baghdad airport to the southern  governorates,  suffering
             serious harm en  route  to  such  governorates  so  as  engage
             Article 15(c).







         E. IRAQI KURDISH REGION

         17.  The Respondent will only return P to the IKR if  P  originates
             from the IKR and P's identity has been 'pre-cleared' with  the
             IKR authorities. The authorities in the IKR do not  require  P
             to have an expired or current passport, or laissez passer.

         18.  The IKR is virtually violence free. There is no Article  15(c)
             risk to an ordinary civilian in the IKR.

         19.   A Kurd (K) who does not originate from  the  IKR  can  obtain
             entry for 10 days as a  visitor  and  then  renew  this  entry
             permission for a further 10 days. If K finds employment, K can
             remain for longer, although K will need to register  with  the
             authorities and provide details of the employer. There  is  no
             evidence that the IKR authorities  pro-actively  remove  Kurds
             from the IKR whose permits have come to an end.

         20.   Whether K, if returned to Baghdad, can reasonably be expected
             to avoid  any  potential  undue  harshness  in  that  city  by
             travelling to the IKR, will be fact sensitive; and  is  likely
             to involve an assessment of (a)  the  practicality  of  travel
             from Baghdad to the IKR (such as to Irbil  by  air);  (b)  the
             likelihood of K's securing employment in the IKR; and (c)  the
             availability of assistance from family and friends in the IKR.

         21.   As a general matter, a non-Kurd who is at real risk in a home
             area in Iraq is unlikely to be able to relocate to the IKR."




The letter of 10 March 2016

11.  The respondent's decision of 10 March 2016 noted that  the  applicant's
    submissions were to the effect that the applicant feared  returning  to
    Mosul as a Sunni Kurd in a majority Arab area and that he  had  had  no
    contact with his family since he left Iraq.  The case of  AA  indicated
    that the applicant could  not  return  to  his  home  area,  given  the
    internal armed conflict there.  The submissions further contended  that
    the applicant's profile included his Kurdish ethnicity and  the  nature
    of the violence in Iraq, which  was  now  said  to  be  ethnically  and
    religiously based.

12.  The respondent further noted that the  applicant's  case  was  that  he
    would be without a CSID,  and  so  would  find  it  difficult  to  find
    employment or housing, as well as access to rations and  support.   The
    applicant had developed a private life in  the  United  Kingdom,  which
    meant that his removal would violate Article 8 of the ECHR.

13.  After setting out extensive  passages  from  the  submissions  made  on
    behalf of the  applicant,  the  letter  expressly  noted  that  it  had
    "previously been accepted" that the applicant was:-

        "an Iraqi national  of  Kurdish  ethnicity  from  Mosul  in  Ninewa
       Governorate and at the current time the  Home  Office  assesses  the
       'contested areas' of Iraq to include the Governorates of ... Ninewa.
        Therefore, it is considered that you would be unable to  return  to
       Mosul City due to the current country situation and consideration is
       given as to whether there are particular factors  relevant  to  your
       individual and  personal  circumstances  in  regards  the  issue  of
       internally relocating within Iraq".

14.   It  is  necessary  to  pause  here  and   observe   the   respondent's
    acknowledgement of  the  importance  of  ascertaining  the  applicant's
    "individual and personal circumstances" in  deciding  whether  internal
    relocation would be reasonable,  since  Mr  Jones,  on  behalf  of  the
    applicant, submits that the applicant's claim requires a fact-sensitive
    examination, which the respondent has failed to provide.

15.  The letter continued by pr�cising and, in  places,  quoting,  what  the
    Tribunal in AA had to say by way  of  country  guidance  regarding  the
    possibility of relocating to Baghdad City.  The letter then quoted from
    paragraph 31 of Judge A D Baker's determination, noting that it was not
    accepted by the judge that the applicant would be at risk in Iraq  over
    and above any other citizen and that the applicant was not  of  adverse
    interest to anyone at the time he left  the  country.   The  respondent
    considered  that  the  applicant  had  provided  no   "significant   or
    conclusive evidence" to demonstrate that the applicant's family members
    no longer lived in Iraq.  The Tribunal in AA had found that  there  was
    support from organisations for internally displaced persons "and it  is
    believed you would have access to this support".

16.  The letter therefore found that it was "possible for  you  to  relocate
    to Baghdad City as a person who is a Kurd and a Sunni Muslim.  You  are
    a young and healthy male and have remained in the  United  Kingdom  for
    eight years now and it is considered that you  have  demonstrated  that
    you are capable of being independent and resourceful and  your  ability
    to find employment is not in doubt.  Therefore it is not considered  to
    be unreasonable or unduly harsh to expect you to relocate in  Iraq,  to
    Baghdad City".

17.  The letter then set out the country guidance findings  in  AA  relating
    to a person's ability to obtain a CSID or an Iraqi nationality card and
    the relevance of, in particular, having a CSID (or not).

18.  The letter continued as follows:-

         "While the UT in AA Iraq did not make findings on how someone  from
         a contested area who is returned to Iraq would be able to reacquire
         a CSID, persons from Mosul city in Ninewah governorate, as well  as
         Anbar and Salah al Din governorates will  in  general  be  able  to
         reacquire a CSID from Baghdad or Najaf, providing they are returned
         on a valid or expired passport.  If they are returned on a  laissez
         passer and do not have a CSID, their ability to  reacquire  a  CSID
         will depend on whether they can prove their identity  to  officials
         by, for example, knowing their (sic) the page and volume number  of
         the book holding their information (and that of their  family)  and
         their ability to persuade officials that they are the person  named
         on the relevant page is likely to depend on whether the  person  as
         (sic) family members or other individuals who are prepared to vouch
         for them.

         Firstly, it is accepted that  those  persons  from  the  'contested
         areas' of Iraq, such as yourself from  Mosul  in  Ninewa  governate
         would be unable to return to their  place  of  origin  due  to  the
         security situation and it is generally not reasonable to  expect  a
         person from there to reacquire documents through a proxy due to the
         circumstances of armed conflict in such 'contested areas'.  In your
         initial screening interview dated 25 March 2008,  you  admitted  to
         being assisted in leaving in (sic) Iraq by your uncle  and  entered
         the UK on 20 February 2008 in a lorry,  but  you  had  no  identity
         documentation because you had  never  been  issued  with  an  Iraqi
         passport, however you stated that your own National  Identity  Card
         was 'in Iraq' (Q: 6.1 - 9.2 refer).  As  outlined  above,  in  your
         statement you have claimed that you have not had any recent contact
         with your family in Iraq despite attempts to do so.   However,  the
         onus is on you to demonstrate why you could not get the appropriate
         identity documentation to enter Baghdad, that is, an Iraqi passport
         (current or expired); a laissez-passer, a Civil  Status  ID  (CSID)
         and Nationality Certificate and you have not  shown  that  you  are
         unable to obtain  the  necessary  documentation  by  attending  the
         consular section of the Iraqi Embassy in the UK.  You  should  also
         note that a lack of travel documents may be a technical obstacle to
         return, but is  not  a  reason  itself  to  grant  protection.   As
         outlined above in AA Iraq, it was  found  a  Civil  Status  Affairs
         Office (CSA) for Mosul has been established in Baghdad and you have
         not demonstrated that it is not feasible for you to be returned  to
         Baghdad City."

19.  The applicant had, as part of his submissions, provided the  respondent
    with a report from Dr Alan George, a recognised expert on  Iraq,  which
    "highlights the issue  of  ongoing  sectarian  violence  in  Iraq,  the
    feasibility of internal relocation and risk on return to  someone  with
    [the applicant's] profile".   Dr  George  was  of  the  view  that  the
    applicant would be at risk in central and southern Iraq because of  his
    Kurdish ethnicity and Sunni Muslim religio-political identity, as  well
    as being at risk of being kidnapped as someone perceived to be wealthy.
     Dr George considered that the applicant, despite being Kurdish,  would
    not be able to reside permanently in the IKR.

20.  The respondent's letter, however, said that Dr George's opinions  added
    nothing to the applicant's case.  This was because  the  applicant  was
    "not of any adverse interest to anyone at the time you left the country
    and  in  regards   your   individual   characteristics   and   personal
    circumstances it has been found that it is possible for you  to  return
    to Iraq and relocate to Baghdad City and as a young male who is a  Kurd
    and a Sunni Muslim.  It was found there are no particular factors  that
    would place you at additional risk than  any  other  civilian  in  Iraq
    ...".  This meant that "Whilst the full contents of the report from  Dr
    George have been considered it is not believed that the report adds any
    further supporting weight to your claims".

21.  Pausing again, Mr Jones submits that  the  letter  wrongly  treats  the
    applicant's position as a  Kurd  and  a  Sunni  Muslim,  who  is  being
    returned to Baghdad, as positive features whereas, in fact, both  place
    him in a problematic minority position in that city.

22.  The letter of 10 March concluded its analysis  of  the  submissions  in
    terms of paragraph 353 as follows:-

         ".   Your claims have been considered in line with the relevant and
             applicable caselaw (sic) AA Iraq.

          .   It is known you are  a  Kurdish  male  from  Mosul  in  Ninewa
             governate and you are independent and resourceful.

         .    It is possible for you to relocate to Baghdad City as a person
             who is a Kurd and a Sunni Muslim, and it is not considered  to
             be unreasonable or unduly harsh to expect you to do  so.   You
             would have community support, general support as an IDP and as
             a failed asylum seeker and can seek employment.

         .    The onus is on you to demonstrate why you could  not  get  the
             appropriate identity documentation to enter Baghdad, that  is,
             an Iraqi passport (current or expired);  a  laissez-passer;  a
             Civil Status ID (CSID) and  Nationality  Certificate  and  you
             have not shown that you are unable  to  obtain  the  necessary
             documentation by attending the consular section of  the  Iraqi
             Embassy in the UK.

         .    The report from Dr George adds no supporting  weight  to  your
             claims when considered in line with AA Iraq and your  personal
             circumstances.

         .    To return you to Iraq would not contravene  Article  15(c)  of
             the Qualification Directive.

         .    It is not believed you have demonstrated that upon  return  to
             Iraq there is  a  real  risk  you  would  face  ill-treatment;
             inhumane or degrading  treatment  or  persecution  that  would
             breach Articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR.

         Therefore, these submissions do not amount to a fresh claim."

23.   The  letter  considered  the  applicant's  private  and  family   life
    submissions, by reference  to  Article  8  and  the  Immigration  Rules
    regarding family and private life.  The respondent concluded  that  the
    applicant did not qualify under  the  Rules  and  that  there  were  no
    exceptional circumstances, such as to make it necessary  to  grant  him
    leave by reference to Article 8.



The letter of 10 November 2016

24.  The  respondent's  letter  of  10  November  2016  is  headed  "FURTHER
    SUBMISSIONS  DECISION  FURTHER  EXPLANATORY  LETTER".   The  respondent
    stated that "This  letter  is  supplementary  to  and  should  be  read
    together with" the letter of 10 March 2016.  She stated that the letter
    of 10 November "does not represent a new decision.  It is  intended  to
    provide  further  clarification  as  to  the  reasons  for  my  earlier
    decision.  This is set out below".

25.  It is necessary to set out in full  the  last  part  of  this  decision
    letter:-

         "6.   I  provide  further  clarification  of  my  conclusions   and
             reasoning as regards each of these factors below.

              (a) Whether you have a CSID or will be able to obtain one

         7.   At paragraphs 152-153 of AA, the Upper Tribunal concluded that
             it will ordinarily be  reasonable  and  not  unduly  harsh  to
             expect an individual who has, or is able to obtain, a CSID  to
             return to Baghdad City.

         8.   The onus is on you to demonstrate to  the  requisite  standard
             that you do not hold a CSID and would be unable to obtain  one
             on return to Iraq.

         9.   You have provided no evidence that you do not presently have a
             CSID.  In the absence of any  such  evidence,  no  immigration
             judge could legitimately conclude that you do not have a CSID.

         10.  Furthermore you have not indicated whether you presently  hold
             a passport or laissez passer but if  you  do  not  it  is  not
             presently feasible for  you  to  return  to  Iraq.   In  those
             circumstances you are not at risk on return by reason  of  the
             absence of documentation, for the  reasons  explained  by  the
             Upper Tribunal in paragraph 170 of AA.

         11.  In addition  you  have  failed  to  provide  any  evidence  to
             demonstrate that you have taken all reasonable steps to obtain
             a passport (or alternatively a laissez passer) from the  Iraqi
             embassy in London, in the absence of which you  would  not  be
             entitled to international protection (HM & others [2013]  EWCA
             Civ 1276).

         12.  Alternatively, if you do hold a passport  or  laissez  passer,
             the Secretary of State and  Tribunal  would  require  to  know
             which documentation was provided to the Iraqi  authorities  in
             order to obtain  it  (AA  at  paragraph  170).   Without  this
             information there is no  real  prospect  that  an  immigration
             judge would conclude that you had overcome the burden to  show
             that you do not hold a CSID.

         13.  In all of the circumstances, there is no real prospect that an
             immigration judge would conclude that it would be unreasonable
             or unjustifiably harsh  for  you  to  internally  relocate  to
             Baghdad City.

              (b) Whether you can speak Arabic

         14.  It is not suggested in  your  further  submissions  or  letter
             before claim or grounds of claim that you do not speak Arabic.
              In any event you have  failed  to  provide  any  evidence  to
             demonstrate that  you  are  unable  to  speak  Arabic  and  an
             immigration judge  could  not  legitimately  conclude  on  the
             evidence that you do not speak Arabic.  There is no  basis  on
             which to conclude that you  could  not  obtain  employment  in
             Baghdad City.

              (c) Whether you have family members or friends in Baghdad able
             to accommodate you

         15.  It is accepted that, notwithstanding the fact that  your  core
             claim was previously found to be  a  dishonest  invention,  it
             cannot be said that there is no prospect that  an  immigration
             judge would accept your account that you are  not  in  contact
             with family members in Iraq.

              (d)  Whether  you  are  a  lone  female  (women  face  greater
             difficulties than men in finding employment)

         16.  You are not a lone female but a healthy young male.

              (e) Whether you can find a sponsor to access a hostel room  or
             rent accommodation

         17.  As you would be returned to Baghdad City, there is no need for
             you to find a sponsor in order to find accommodation.  In  any
             event, there is no evidence upon which  an  immigration  judge
             could conclude that you would be unable to rent accommodation.

              (f) Whether you are from a minority community

         18.  You are a Sunni  Muslim  of  Kurdish  ethnicity.   It  is  not
             considered that you would belong to a  minority  community  in
             Baghdad City in the sense explained by the Upper  Tribunal  in
             AA, when it stated that 'Those from minority  communities  are
             less likely to be able to access community support than  those
             from the Sunni and Shi'a communities'.  In  any  event  it  is
             clear that there is a substantial number of Sunni  Muslims  of
             Kurdish ethnicity in  Baghdad  City,  even  if  Shi'a  Muslims
             represent the religious majority.   As  previously  explained,
             there is no real prospect  that  an  immigration  judge  would
             choose to depart from the Country Guidance set down in  AA  on
             the basis of the evidence of Dr George (which  pre-dated  it).
             Furthermore there is no evidence that you are  anything  other
             than a healthy young man of working age well able  to  provide
             for yourself in Baghdad City.

              (g) Whether there is support available for you bearing in mind
             there is some evidence that returned failed asylum seekers are
             provided with the support generally given to IDPs

         19.  If you were to  return  voluntarily  to  Iraq,  you  would  be
             eligible for financial support through the Voluntary  Assisted
             Return and  Reintegration  Programme.   Support  may  also  be
             available to you from Iraqi and  international  agencies  upon
             your return.  In any event, there is  no  reasonable  prospect
             that an immigration judge  would  conclude  to  the  requisite
             standard that you would be unable to support yourself  if  you
             were returned to Baghdad City.

              Conclusion on internal relocation

         20.  Taking all of these factors into account, I  concluded  in  my
             earlier decision that 'You are a young and  healthy  male  and
             have remained in the United Kingdom for 8 years now and it  is
             considered that you have demonstrated that you are capable  of
             being independent and resourceful and  your  ability  to  find
             employment is not in doubt.  Therefore, it is  not  considered
             to be unreasonable or unduly harsh to expect you  to  relocate
             in Iraq, to Baghdad City.'

         21.  There is no realistic prospect that an immigration judge would
             conclude otherwise.

              Updated Country Information and Guidance

         22.  In August 2016 the Home Office published updated  guidance  as
             to the security and  humanitarian  situation  in  Iraq.   This
             guidance is publically available on  the  official  Government
             website  at   https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/iraq-
             country-information-and-guidance.

         23.  You have not sought to make further submissions based  on  the
             contents of that Country  Information  and  Guidance,  or  the
             other evidence referred to  therein.   For  the  avoidance  of
             doubt, the updated guidance is not of assistance to your claim
             and is not considered herein."




Discussion

26.  As  is  well-known,  the  standard  of  review  in  a  judicial  review
    concerning the application of paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules is
    Wednesbury, with the application of  the  requisite  anxious  scrutiny.
    Approaching matters in this way, I find that the respondent's decisions
    of 10 March and 10 November 2016 fall to be quashed.  In  essence,  the
    respondent has failed to take proper account of the case of AA.

27.  Before giving my reasons  for  this  conclusion,  it  is  necessary  to
    consider what relationship the decision of 10 November  2016  bears  on
    the decision of 10 March.  The issue of supplementary decision  letters
    in the  context  of  immigration  judicial  review  has  recently  been
    subjected to close examination by the Court of  Appeal  in  Caroopen  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department & Anor [2016] EWCA Civ 1307.
     Applying the analysis of Underhill  LJ,  the  letter  of  10  November
    reveals itself,  almost  entirely,  as  a  "further  reasons"  type  of
    supplementary letter (as described in paragraph 30  of  the  judgment).
    The letter of 10 November is, I consider, predominantly an  attempt  to
    engage and apply the country guidance in AA to  a  far  greater  extent
    than was discernible in the earlier decision.

28.  What, though, of paragraphs 22  and  23  of  the  10  November  letter?
    Here, the respondent, of her own volition, made  reference  to  updated
    country material published by the Home Office in August 2016.  Although
    paragraph 23 claims that this material was "not considered", it plainly
    was considered by the respondent; otherwise, she could not have  formed
    the view that the "updated  guidance  is  not  of  assistance"  to  the
    applicant's claim.  To this extent, the letter of  10  November  in  my
    view fall to be  treated  as  a  "new  material"  case,  the  third  of
    Underhill LJ's four categories (paragraph 32 of the judgment).  As  the
    Judge observed at paragraph  4,  although  the  "categories  are  clear
    enough conceptually ... they can often be blurred  in  practice".   So,
    what we have here is a hybrid.

29.  Mr Jones makes the point that, since the respondent chose to  introduce
    the August 2016 Home Office guidance, the applicant should be  entitled
    to pray in aid provisions of that guidance that show the maintaining by
    the respondent of her position not to treat the applicant's submissions
    as a fresh claim is legally flawed.  In this regard, Mr Jones points in
    particular to paragraphs 3.1.1 to 3.1.5 of  the  guidance,  which  note
    that Sunnis may be at real risk of persecution or serious harm from the
    Shia militia in Baghdad unless they have tribal,  family  or  political
    links which mean they would not be at risk and so can relocate to  that
    city.   Furthermore,  although  the  paragraph  353  and   section   94
    certificate tests are conceptually different,  it  is  noteworthy  that
    paragraph 3.1.5 of the guidance states that, if refused,  "a  claim  is
    unlikely to be certifiable as 'clearly unfounded' under section 94"  of
    the 2002 Act.

30.  At paragraph 2.2.6 of the  guidance,  we  find  that  Sunni  internally
    displaced persons who generally  lack  support  networks  and  economic
    means, are more vulnerable to suspicion and  abuse  and  so  "decision-
    makers need to consider each case on its merits".  At paragraph  2.3.4,
    decision-makers are told that they  "must  explore  whether  there  are
    circumstances - such as family, tribal or political links - in which  a
    person can obtain protection".

31.  Mr Jones quite properly draws attention to paragraph  2.4.2,  where  it
    is said that Sunnis number at least in the  hundreds  of  thousands  in
    Baghdad.  Nevertheless, paragraph 2.4.3 records that a  Sunni  "may  be
    required to find a sponsor to enter the city, although this requirement
    is subject to change based on the changing security situation".

32.  I find that the inclusion of paragraphs 22 and 23 in the letter  of  10
    November 2016 permits the applicant, in  the  context  of  the  present
    proceedings, to point to the passages in the August 2016  guidance,  to
    which I have just made reference.  The fact that the respondent did not
    engage with those paragraphs, in the context of the applicant's  claim,
    underscores the respondent's general failing, in both of  the  decision
    letters, to consider with the requisite anxious scrutiny the particular
    circumstances of the applicant, by reference to the findings in AA.

33.  The fact that the situation  in  Iraq,  as  identified  in  AA,  raises
    complex, often  intertwining,  issues  of  potential  risk  is  clearly
    demonstrated in the decision of the Upper Tribunal to remit the case of
    the individual known as AA to the First-tier  Tribunal,  in  order  for
    findings to be made, which would enable the First-tier Tribunal to have
    a comprehensive picture of AA's circumstances. This  was  necessary  to
    determine the reasonableness  of  AA's  proposed  internal  relocation.
    This aspect of AA was, I find, overlooked  by  the  respondent  in  the
    present case.

34.  The factual lacuna which troubled the Upper  Tribunal  in  AA  was  the
    lack of any finding regarding the ability of AA to  speak  Arabic.   In
    the present case, as Mr Chapman fairly acknowledges, it is  simply  not
    correct to assert, as  the  respondent  did,  that  the  applicant  had
    provided "no evidence" to show he was unable to speak Arabic.  At  page
    B7 of the bundle we find the applicant's  screening  interview  record,
    following his claim for asylum.  In answer to the  question  "What  are
    ALL the languages/dialects that you speak?" (original  capitalisation),
    the appellant replied "Kurdish,  Badini".   There  is  nothing  in  the
    determination of Judge A D Baker to  suggest  that  the  applicant,  in
    fact, also knows Arabic.  Thus, the respondent failed to apply  anxious
    scrutiny to this significant issue.

35.   I agree with Mr Jones that the respondent's  decision-making  displays
    a failure, in  effect,  to  step  back  from  the  adverse  credibility
    findings of the immigration judge, in  her  determination  (which  have
    become of little or no relevance in the years that have  elapsed  since
    their determination) and ask what a  hypothetical  judge,  hearing  the
    applicant's appeal in 2016, would make of a claim  brought  by  someone
    who left Mosul as child, whose home area is  in  a  state  of  internal
    armed conflict (with all that might entail for his ability  to  contact
    family members) and who, if returned to Baghdad, would be  going  there
    as a Kurd and a Sunni, both of which place him in the position of being
    in a minority in that city.  I should mention here that,  although  the
    respondent's decision engaged with the  possibility  of  the  applicant
    being able to relocate to the IKR, neither side regarded this issue  as
    relevant.  The background evidence indicates that  onward  travel  from
    Baghdad to that zone is highly problematic.

36.   I  turn  to  the  issue  of  documentation.   As  can  be  seen,   the
    respondent's position on this moved 180� between the two  letters.   In
    the first, the respondent's stance was that the applicant had failed to
    take any steps to show that he would  not  be  able  to  secure  travel
    documentation to facilitate his return to Iraq.  By  the  time  of  the
    second letter, a further reading of the Tribunal's decision in  AA  led
    the respondent to contend that the applicant had failed to  demonstrate
    it was feasible for him to return  to  Iraq.   Given,  therefore,  that
    return was not presently  feasible,  the  respondent  relied  upon  the
    finding at  paragraph  7  of  the  country  guidance  in  AA,  that  an
    international protection claim  cannot  succeed  by  reference  to  any
    alleged risk of harm arising from an absence  of  Iraqi  identification
    documentation, if the Tribunal finds that  a  person's  return  is  not
    currently feasible, given what is known about the state of  a  person's
    documentation.

37.  In support of this aspect of the respondent's case, Mr  Chapman  refers
    to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in MA (Ethiopia) v Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2009] EWCA  Civ  289.   There,  a  claim
    based upon the denial  by  the  Ethiopian  authorities  of  a  person's
    Ethiopian nationality foundered upon the applicant's  failure  to  take
    reasonable steps (such as applying to the Ethiopian Embassy in  London)
    to secure her documented return as such a national.

38.  But, as Mr Jones counters in reply, the difference between MA  and  the
    present case is that in AA the Upper Tribunal undertook, as part of its
    country guidance, a  detailed  forensic  examination  of  the  evidence
    concerning the availability of  relevant  documentation,  both  in  the
    United Kingdom and Iraq.  A judicial  fact-finder,  accordingly,  would
    not necessarily be acting speculatively or otherwise  contrary  to  the
    judgment in MA, if he or she were to  examine  the  likelihood  of  the
    applicant being able to obtain relevant documentation, through the lens
    of the country guidance in AA.

39.   Mr Jones points out that permission to appeal to the Court  of  Appeal
    was granted by that court in 2016 in relation to the  Upper  Tribunal's
    country guidance finding at  paragraph  7,  based  as  it  was  on  the
    judgment in HF  (Iraq)  &  Ors  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2013] EWCA Civ 1276.  The legal position,  at  the  present
    time, is however  plain:  unless  or  until  overturned  on  appeal  or
    replaced by other country guidance, the guidance in AA remains  binding
    on the hypothetical First-tier Tribunal Judge.

40.  There is a further, discrete reason why the  respondent's  reliance  on
    the  "documentation"  issue  is  misconceived.   Having  explained  the
    importance, in its view, of HF (Iraq), the Tribunal in AA said:-

         "169.    On one reading of HF (Iraq) - particularly the highlighted
                passage in paragraph 101 - the impossibility of return could
                be said to make it unnecessary to hypothesise any risk to an
                appellant in the country of proposed return, whether or  not
                stemming from a lack of documentation or similar problem. We
                do not, however, consider that the Court  can  be  taken  to
                have intended such a reading. There may be  cases  where  it
                will be evident that the person concerned would be  at  real
                risk of persecution or serious harm irrespective of lack  of
                documentation. Were Nazi persecution of the  Jews  occurring
                today,  it  would  clearly  subvert  the  purpose   of   the
                Convention  to  deny  refugee  status  on  the  basis  that,
                regardless of what might  happen  to  appellants  on  return
                because they are Jewish, they cannot in practice be returned
                (whether because of documentation or mere refusal  to  admit
                Jews to Nazi Germany). For this reason, we consider that the
                judgment  in  HF  (Iraq)  does  not  preclude  a  claim   to
                international protection from  succeeding,  insofar  as  the
                asserted risk of harm  is  not  (or  not  solely)  based  on
                factors (such  as  lack  of  documentation)  that  currently
                render a person's actual return unfeasible.

         170. In the absence of an expired  or  current  Iraqi  passport,  a
                person can only be returned  to  Baghdad  using  a  laissez-
                passer. According to Dr Fatah, either a CSID  or  INC  or  a
                photocopy of a previous Iraqi passport and a  police  report
                noting that it had been lost or stolen is required in  order
                to obtain a laissez-passer. If a person does not have one of
                these documents then they cannot obtain a laissez-passer and
                therefore cannot be returned. This has a significant bearing
                on what we have just said.  If  the  position  is  that  the
                Secretary of State can feasibly remove  an  Iraqi  national,
                then she will be expected to tell the tribunal  whether  and
                if so what documentation has led the  Iraqi  authorities  to
                issue the national with the passport or laissez  passer  (or
                signal their intention to do so). The Tribunal will need  to
                know, in particular, whether  the  person  concerned  has  a
                CSID. It is only where return is feasible but the individual
                concerned does not have a CSID that the consequences of  not
                having one come into play."

41.  Two points emerge.  First, a person  who  is  found  to  be  returnable
    (because he or she has or will be able to obtain a passport or laissez-
    passer) may, nevertheless, face difficulties if he or she cannot obtain
    a CSID, following return.  Secondly (and  crucially),  a  person  whose
    return is not currently feasible may, nevertheless, still succeed in  a
    claim to international protection, if and insofar as the claim is based
    on a real risk of harm, which arises otherwise than by not  having  the
    requisite documentation.

42.  The significance of this second point emerges clearly  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal's application to the appellant AA of its country guidance:-

         "206.    However, the Respondent has confirmed that  the  Appellant
                would be returned to Baghdad city. There is no evidence that
                the Appellant has access  to  a  current  or  expired  Iraqi
                passport, or a laissez-passer, and we conclude that he  does
                not. In all the circumstances we find that he  will  not  be
                returnable  until  he   is   able   to   supply   sufficient
                documentation to the Iraqi Embassy in London to enable it to
                provide him with a passport or a laissez passer.  This  will
                only occur if he can provide a copy of a CSID or Nationality
                Certificate.  His  return  is,  therefore,   not   currently
                feasible.

         207. Given that the appellant's return is not currently feasible it
                could be said that it is unnecessary to hypothesise any risk
                to him upon his return to Iraq. However,  as  identified  in
                paragraphs 169 and 170 above, there may be  cases  where  it
                will be evident that the person concerned would be  at  real
                risk of persecution or serious harm irrespective of the lack
                of  documentation  and  that  an  applicant  should  not  be
                precluded for pursuing a claim to  international  protection
                in circumstances where the asserted risk of harm is not  (or
                not solely) based on factors (such as lack of documentation)
                that currently render a person's actual return unfeasible."

43.   As a result, AA does not support  the  respondent's  approach  in  the
    present case to the issue of documentation.  The  respondent's  failure
    to consider the way in which the Upper  Tribunal  applied  its  country
    guidance to the individual concerned has led the respondent into error.
     She has failed to  apply  the  requisite  anxious  scrutiny.   A  risk
    analysis by reference to all the factors set out  in  AA  needs  to  be
    undertaken.  As I have already found, the respondent's decision letters
    are deficient in this regard.



Decision

44.  For these reasons, the decisions of 10 March and 10 November 2016  fall
    to be quashed.  In the circumstances, it is not necessary to dwell upon
    the Article 8 issue.  Whilst there is force in  Mr  Jones's  contention
    that the deficiencies in the respondent's decision making affected  her
    consideration of whether there might be "very significant obstacles  to
    integration into" Iraq, that issue will need to be  considered  afresh,
    by reference to the then current position.

45.  I shall hear the parties on the issue of  costs,  unless  this  can  be
    agreed.~~~~0~~~~
