                            DECISION AND REASONS

BACKGROUND

1. The Appellant appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
   Bart-Stewart promulgated on 10 March 2020 ("the Decision").  By the
   Decision, the Judge dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the
   Respondent's decision dated 7 October 2019 refusing a human rights claim.
    That claim was made in the context of a decision to deport the Appellant
   to Nigeria.


2. The Appellant is a national of Nigeria.  He came to the UK in June 2009
   as a visitor and overstayed.  On 22 November 2011, he applied for a
   residence card as the family member of an EEA national spouse.  That
   application was refused.  On 25 March 2013, he applied to remain as the
   primary carer of a British citizen child.  That application also was
   refused.  The Appellant did not appeal.

3. The Appellant was later granted leave to remain from March 2014 to
   September 2016.  However, he was refused further leave.  Following a
   judicial review challenge of that refusal, the Respondent agreed to
   reconsider the application.

4. On 28 March 2019, the Appellant was convicted of an offence of making
   false representations to make gain for himself or another or cause loss
   to another/expose another to risk.  He was sentenced to two years six
   months in prison.  On the basis of that offence, the Respondent gave
   notice of her intention to deport the Appellant.  The Appellant claimed
   that deportation would breach his private and family life.  He relies in
   particular on his relationship with his four children who are all British
   nationals or settled in the UK.

5. The Judge found that it would not be unduly harsh for the children to go
   to live in Nigeria or remain in the UK without him and that it was not
   unduly harsh for the Appellant's partner(s) to either go with him to
   Nigeria or remain in the UK without him.  The Appellant could not meet
   the Immigration Rules ("the Rules") based on his private life.  He has
   not been legally resident in the UK for more than half his life.  The
   Judge found that the Appellant could not meet the exceptions to
   deportation within the Rules/Section 117C Nationality, Immigration and
   Asylum Act 2002 ("Section 117C").  Having conducted a balancing exercise
   outside the Rules, the Judge concluded that the refusal of the
   Appellant's claim was not disproportionate.  He could be deported to
   Nigeria.

6. The Appellant challenges the Decision on three grounds as follows:

   Ground 1: The Judge has failed to state the burden and standard of proof
   applied.
   Ground 2: The Judge has failed to identify what are the best interests of
   the children.
   Ground 3: The Judge has erred in her consideration of the OASys report.

7. Permission to appeal was, on the face of the decision, refused by First-
   tier Tribunal Judge Osborne on 1 May 2020.  However, as is apparent from
   the reasoning set out below, this was in fact a grant of permission:

         "... 3.  In an otherwise careful and detailed Decision, it is
         arguable that the Judge applied the wrong burden and standard of
         proof because the Judge failed to refer to the same.


         4.   This arguably material error of law having been identified,
         all the Grounds are arguable."

8. Judge Osborne's decision was reviewed by Upper Tribunal Judge Frances in
   her Note and Directions.  She concluded that the Judge had meant to grant
   permission as is evident from the reasons.  She therefore amended the
   decision to a permission grant. In her Note and Directions, Judge Frances
   also reached the provisional view that the error of law issue could be
   determined on the papers.  The Appellant by written submissions sought an
   oral hearing.


9. The Respondent filed a Rule 24 reply on 9 September 2020 seeking to
   uphold the Decision.


10. On 3 December 2020, UTJ Mandalia directed that the error of law issue
   should be determined at a remote hearing.

11. So it is that the matter came before me to determine whether the
   Decision contains an error of law and, if I so concluded, to either re-
   make the decision or remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to do
   so.


12. The hearing took place remotely via Skype for Business.  There was some
   delay to the start of the hearing due to technical issues within the
   Tribunal.  Thereafter, the hearing proceeded without incident.

13. Following brief submissions by Mr Slatter which I set out below, Mr
   Walker conceded that there is an error of law in the Decision.  I agreed
   with that concession.  It was agreed that, since the evaluation of the
   Appellant's family and private life would need to be considered entirely
   afresh as a result of the error made, it would be appropriate for the
   appeal to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for redetermination.

14. I therefore found there to be an error of law in the Decision.  I set
   the Decision aside in its entirety and remitted the appeal to the First-
   tier Tribunal.  I indicated to the parties that I would give short
   reasons in relation to the error of law and next steps which I now turn
   to do.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Ground 1


15. The Respondent accepts in her Rule 24 reply that the Judge did not
   direct herself as to the appropriate burden and standard of proof.  She
   says however that this is a criticism of "form over substance".


16. The Appellant's pleaded ground in this regard is that the Decision "is
   silent" as to burden and standard and "accordingly, the Appellant cannot
   be satisfied that his appeal has been properly determined by the FTTJ".

17. The ground is not developed in writing.  Had it been put as it was
   argued by Mr Slatter I have no doubt that the Respondent would have
   conceded the error of law in this appeal in the Rule 24 reply.  As it is,
   based on Mr Slatter's oral submissions and for the reasons which follow,
   I am satisfied that there is an error of law disclosed by this ground.
   Mr Walker rightly conceded as much.



18. Although the Judge does not direct herself in relation to the burden
   and standard of proof, she does set out what she considers to be the
   relevant legal approach when determining whether deportation of the
   Appellant would have an unduly harsh effect on his children.


19. At [53] of the Decision the Judge says this:

         "With regards to whether it would be unduly harsh for the
         appellant's children to remain in the UK without the appellant in
         KMO (Section 117 - unduly harsh) Nigeria [2015] UKUT 00543 and MAB
         (para 399: "unduly harsh") USA [2015] UKUT 00435 the Upper Tribunal
         considered the matters to which the Tribunal must have regard as a
         consequence of the provisions of Section 117C, in particular that
         the more serious the offence committed the greater is the public
         interest in deportation of a foreign criminal and that the word
         "unduly" requires consideration of whether in the light of the
         seriousness of the offences committed by the foreign criminal and
         the public interest considerations that come into play, the impact
         on the child, children or partner of the foreign criminal being
         deported is inordinately or excessively harsh.  In MAB it is said
         that the consequences of deportation as unduly harsh requires more
         than "uncomfortable, inconvenient, undesirable, unwelcome or merely
         difficult and challenging" consequences and imposes a considerably
         more elevated or higher threshold."

20. The Tribunal decisions in KMO and MAB to which the Judge there refers
   were considered by the Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria) and others v
   Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] UKSC 53 ("KO
   (Nigeria)").  In relation to the test to be applied, the Supreme Court
   had this to say:

         "21. The difficult question is whether the specific rules allow any
         further room for balancing  of  the  relative  seriousness  of  the
         offence, beyond the difference  between  the  two  categories.  The
         general rule stated in subsection (2) might lead one to expect some
         such provision, but it could equally be read  as  no  more  than  a
         preamble to the more specific rules. Exception 1 seems to leave  no
         room for further balancing. It is precisely defined by reference to
         three factual issues: lawful residence in the UK for  most  of  C's
         life, social and  cultural  integration  into  the  UK,  and  'very
         significant obstacles' to integration into the country of  proposed
         deportation. None of these turns on the seriousness of the offence;
         but, for a sentence of less than four years, they  are  enough,  if
         they are met, to remove the public  interest  in  deportation.  For
         sentences of four years or more, however, it is not enough to  fall
         within the exception, unless there are in addition 'very compelling
         circumstances'.


         22.   Given  that  exception  1  is  self-contained,  it  would  be
         surprising to find exception 2 structured in a  different  way.  On
         its face it raises a factual issue seen from the point of  view  of
         the partner or child:  would  the  effect  of  C's  deportation  be
         "unduly harsh"? Although the language is perhaps less precise  than
         that of exception 1, there is nothing  to  suggest  that  the  word
         'unduly' is intended as a reference back to the issue  of  relative
         seriousness introduced by subsection (2).  Like  exception  1,  and
         like the test of 'reasonableness' under section 117B,  exception  2
         appears self-contained.


         23.  On the other hand the expression 'unduly harsh' seems  clearly
         intended to introduce a higher hurdle than that of 'reasonableness'
         under section 117B(6), taking account of the public interest in the
         deportation of foreign criminals. Further the word 'unduly' implies
         an element of comparison. It assumes that there is a 'due' level of
         'harshness', that is a level which may be acceptable or justifiable
         in the relevant context. 'Unduly' implies  something  going  beyond
         that level. The relevant context is that set  by  section  117C(1),
         that  is  the  public  interest  in  the  deportation  of   foreign
         criminals. One is looking for a degree of  harshness  going  beyond
         what would necessarily be involved for any  child  faced  with  the
         deportation of a parent. What it does not require in my  view  (and
         subject to the discussion of the cases in the next  section)  is  a
         balancing of relative levels of severity of the  parent's  offence,
         other than is inherent in the  distinction  drawn  by  the  section
         itself by reference to length of sentence.  Nor  (contrary  to  the
         view of the Court of Appeal in IT (Jamaica) v Secretary  of  State
         for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 932, [2017]  1  WLR  240,
         paras 55, 64) can it be equated with a requirement  to  show  'very
         compelling reasons'. That would  be  in  effect  to  replicate  the
         additional  test  applied  by  section  117C(6)  with  respect   to
         sentences of four years or more."

21. At [32] of its judgment and on the basis that the Tribunal in KMO  had
   concluded that the relative seriousness of the offence fell to be
   balanced in the evaluation whether the impact of deportation would be
   unduly harsh, the Supreme Court disagreed with the Tribunal's analysis of
   the test as appears in that case.  The Supreme Court did not disagree
   with the outcome of the Tribunal's reasoning in the appeal itself because
   it concluded at [36] of the judgment in KO (Nigeria) that when the
   Tribunal made its findings "no account is taken of the seriousness of the
   particular offences, or of the particular criminal history of the
   father".


22. The Judge in this case wrongly directed herself that the test whether
   deportation is unduly harsh required her to consider the impact of
   deportation on the children taking into account the seriousness of the
   Appellant's offending and public interest considerations.  Whilst that is
   not a wrong approach when a Judge is evaluating the impact of deportation
   under Section 117C(6) in order to decide whether there are very
   compelling circumstances over and above the exceptions in Sections
   117C(4) and (5) which outweigh the public interest in deportation, it is
   the wrong approach when considering whether the exceptions are satisfied.
    A balancing of the seriousness of the offending is not part of the test
   when considering the exceptions.  The "unduly harsh" test set out in
   Section 117C(5) is a threshold test.  Whilst I accept that the Judge has
   correctly directed herself as to the high threshold which applies when
   considering whether the impact is unduly harsh, she has erred in her
   statement that the seriousness of the offending is to be taken into
   account at this stage.

23. I accept that there is little in paragraphs [50] to [52] and [54] to
   [55] of the Decision which suggests that the Judge did in fact take into
   account the seriousness of the Appellant's offending when looking at
   whether deportation would be unduly harsh for the children.  However,
   given the clear misdirection in this regard which sits immediately
   between the analysis in this regard, I cannot be confident that the Judge
   has not applied that approach when assessing whether deportation would be
   unduly harsh.  Mr Walker did not submit that the error was not for that
   reason material.


24. As I have indicated above, the taking into account of the seriousness
   of the offending is not incorrect when one comes to look at Section
   117C(6).  The Judge at [59] onwards of the Decision does not refer to
   Section 117C(6) but is in effect conducting that exercise as she puts it
   outside the Rules.  I asked Mr Slatter whether it might be said that the
   error made at [53] of the Decision would make no difference because the
   Judge was entitled to take into account the seriousness of the offending
   at this point and has reached the overall conclusion that deportation is
   not disproportionate.

25. I accept Mr Slatter's response that it cannot be said that the error
   made no difference.  That is because, at [63] of the Decision, as part of
   the balancing of impact of deportation against the public interest, the
   Judge repeats her earlier finding that exception 2 (that is to say
   Section 117C(5)) is not met.  It is perhaps here that one sees how the
   error has impacted the Judge's earlier assessment as she says the
   following:

         "Exception 1 does not apply for the reasons already stated.  This
         is also the case in respect of exception 2.  The appellant's
         sentence was 2 � years' imprisonment.  The public interest is very
         strong policy.  The sentence of 2 � years' imprisonment for a first
         offence reflects the seriousness of the offence."

26. For those reasons, I am satisfied that there is an error disclosed by
   the first ground albeit not for the reasons set out in the written
   pleading.

Grounds 2 and 3


27. In light of my conclusion on the first ground, I do not, strictly, need
   to go on to consider the other grounds.  I do so for completeness.


28. I would not have found an error disclosed by either ground.  The Judge
   has made findings in relation to the children's best interests at [47] of
   the Decision. Paragraphs [62] to [64] of the Decision have to be read
   together in relation to what is said about the Appellant's offending.
   The Judge recognised at [64] of the Decision that the evidence showed, as
   the Respondent accepted, that the Appellant is at low risk of
   reoffending.  Nonetheless, the risk of serious harm was said to be
   medium.  Read as a whole, what is said at [62] to [64] of the Decision is
   a fair reflection of the evidence, including the OASys report, considered
   in the round.


29. I do not however preserve any of the findings made in the Decision.
   The best interests of the children will need to be re-evaluated as at the
   date of the next hearing.  Although the findings of the Judge on the
   evidence are, as I say, a fair reflection of what that evidence shows,
   another Judge will potentially need to consider that for himself or
   herself in the context of an overall assessment.  It would not be
   appropriate to preserve another Judge's views of what the evidence shows.



CONCLUSION


30. For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that there is an error of law
   disclosed in the Decision by the first ground.  I do not preserve any of
   the findings.  I therefore set the decision aside in its entirety.



   DECISION

   The Decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Bart-Stewart promulgated on 10
   March 2020 involves the making of an error on a point of law. I therefore
   set aside the Decision.  I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal
   for re-hearing before a Judge other than Judge Bart-Stewart.
