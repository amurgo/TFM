                            DECISION AND REASONS

Decision and reasons

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal to refuse him international protection under the  Refugee
    Convention, humanitarian protection or leave to remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom on human  rights  grounds.   The  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal has been set aside for remaking in the  Upper  Tribunal,  with
    reference both to the credibility of the appellant's account,  and  the
    expert country evidence of Dr Tahiraj.

Background

 2. The appellant is an Albanian citizen,  born  in  the  capital  city  of
    Tirana in September 1999.   His  core  account  may  be  summarised  as
    follows.  He attended school only until 2010, when he was 11 years old.
    His mother insisted he left school: the appellant was needed to support
    the family by selling various items on the  streets  and  in  a  market
    place in Tirana. Theirs was a poor family, with the appellant's  father
    working as a handyman and his mother a housewife.

 3. In July 2013, when he was 13, the appellant says he was  approached  by
    two men while he was working in the market.  They  asked  if  he  would
    like a new job, working  with  sheep  and  cultivating  tomatoes.   The
    appellant accepted, after consulting his  parents.   His  understanding
    was that the money he received would be better than he was earning.

 4. The two men drove him to an old house in a village called  Fush�  Lur�,
    where he spent a week, staying in the house and helping  care  for  the
    sheep.  Then he was moved to a different  house,  where  he  cultivated
    crops with 10 other young people: although he expected  that  the  crop
    would be tomatoes, he was later told it was cannabis.

 5. The appellant did have contact with his family while he was there,  but
    not often.  The workers were badly treated: they had to work very  long
    hours and did not  get  enough  food.   They  worked  from  morning  to
    evening, 12-13 hours a day, then  slept  the  rest  of  the  time.  The
    appellant only ever met two men from the gang.  The  workers  were  not
    guarded at the farm, and the two men were not there  24  hours  a  day:
    they came and went.

 6. The appellant was paid sometimes for his work, but not consistently. He
    saved up about 500,000 LEK (about �3600 today) in his  pillowcase.  The
    appellant tried  to  escape  once  from  the  cannabis  farm,  but  was
    recaptured and punished by having his thumb cut with a knife.  A doctor
    was called the next day to treat his injured finger:  the  tendons  had
    been cut, and it needed stitches.

 7. In 2015, when the appellant was 15, the traffickers took him  to  apply
    for a passport as there might be opportunities for him to traffic drugs
    abroad.   The  appellant  eventually  escaped  in  August   2015:   the
    traffickers failed to appear that day, alternatively there was a police
    raid and he escaped in the ensuing chaos. He took the  savings  out  of
    his pillowcase, and his new passport, and with  the  other  workers  he
    walked away.

 8. After about an hour, they were picked up by a passing minibus and taken
    to Tirana.  The appellant went home  and  told  his  parents  what  had
    happened.  He gave his mother the money he had saved up.

 9. In early November 2015, the appellant left  Albania:   his  father  had
    organised his journey.  The appellant's father accompanied him  on  the
    flight to Italy, and the appellant then travelled on alone, by train to
    France, and then by lorry to the United Kingdom, entering clandestinely
    on 23 November 2015.  He would have been 16 years old then.

10. The next day, the appellant presented  himself  at  London  Borough  of
    Waltham Forest Children's Services.  A social worker contacted the Home
    Office about making an asylum claim appointment for  him.   He  claimed
    asylum on 19 January 2016 and had a screening interview the  same  day.
    At his screening interview he gave different dates (2011-2013) for  his
    cannabis farming period. His asylum interview was on 21 April 2016.

11. The appellant has a valid Albanian passport, which he renewed  recently
    at the Albanian embassy in  London,  and  an  Albanian  identity  card,
    issued to him by the Embassy as he is now an  adult  Albanian  citizen.
    On 4 September 2020, he married his EEA partner in the United  Kingdom.
     He is now 20 years old.

12. The appellant's fear is that if returned to  Albania,  the  traffickers
    will find him and either kill him or force him to work for them again.

NRM decisions

13. The appellant benefited initially from a Reasonable Grounds decision in
    his favour: on 25 January 2016, the respondent accepted that there were
    reasonable grounds to  believe  that  he  had  been  trafficked  within
    Albania for the purpose of forced criminality.  The  positive  decision
    was made to a lower standard of 'I suspect but cannot prove'.

14. The Conclusive Grounds decision, made on 8 August  2016  to  the  civil
    standard of balance of  probabilities,  was  negative.  The  respondent
    identified a number of credibility issues which caused  her  to  reject
    the appellant's core account:

      a) That the appellant had said, in his  witness  statement,  that  his
         mother told him to take the farming job, as the family  needed  the
         money, while in his asylum interview he said he wanted to take  the
         job as it was a better job.

      b) That it was inconsistent that the appellant received some  pay  for
         his work on the cannabis farm, albeit he had no means  of  spending
         it, meaning that he was not held against his will;

      c) That it was not credible that the gang took the  appellant  to  the
         Albanian authorities (described,  erroneously,  in  the  Conclusive
         Grounds decision as the 'Albanian Embassy'),  to  get  a  passport,
         when he was  only  15,  although  the  UN  Refugee  Agency  website
         indicated that to obtain a passport under the age of 16, one  would
         need to be  accompanied  by  a  parent  or  legal  guardian,  or  a
         representative with a special proxy arranged through an attorney;

      d) That the cutting of the appellant's thumb during an escape attempt,
         following  by  medical  treatment  by  a  local  doctor,  was   not
         consistent with the illegal nature of the enterprise and the gang's
         fear of discovery;

      e) That the appellant gave differing accounts of  his  escape,  saying
         the in his witness statement that it was during the chaos caused by
         a police raid, and in his asylum interview, that the men failed  to
         return and he decided to escape;

      f) That the appellant said in his witness statement that the gang also
         abused his father, but in his interview, that he was the  only  one
         who had problems with the gang;

      g) That the appellant delayed leaving  Albania,  despite  his  claimed
         fear; and

      h) That the appellant's father disappearing in Italy having  'gone  to
         buy something' was not credible, so soon after  they  left  Albania
         together.

15. The Secretary of State rejected the appellant's  entire  account.   She
    set out the relevant parts of her Guidance, in particular that:

         "...in a child trafficking case, the means [threat, use of force or
         other form of coercion etc] component is not required, as they  are
         not able to give informed consent.  Child  human  trafficking  will
         therefore  consist  of   two   basic   components,   'action'   and
         'exploitation'."

16. The respondent accepted that at all material times, the appellant was a
    minor.   She  then  considers  whether  the  appellant  was  recruited,
    transported, transferred, harboured or  received  for  the  purpose  of
    forced criminality, which the Guidance defines as:

         "... The exploitation of a person to commit: ...

                . Drug cultivation, and

                . Other similar activities which are  subject  to  penalties
                  and imply financial gain."

    The respondent noted that European  Directive  011/36/EU  defines  such
    activities as a form of forced labour or services, as  defined  in  the
    ILO Convention No 9 Concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour [1930],  but
    comments that in the Secretary of State's guidance,  'the  exploitation
    of a person for criminal activity only falls within the  scope  of  the
    definition of trafficking in human beings  when  all  the  elements  of
    forced labour or services occur'.

17. The Competent Authority's rejection of the core account meant that  the
    Secretary of State did not believe that the  appellant  had  been  held
    against his will and forced into cannabis cultivation.   The  Secretary
    of State did not accept that the  appellant  was  a  victim  of  modern
    slavery or had been trafficked for the purpose of forced criminality.

Refusal letter

18. In a refusal letter dated  21  March  2019,  over  3  years  after  the
    appellant's  initial  asylum  claim,  the  respondent  refused  t   the
    appellant asylum, humanitarian protection, or leave to remain on  human
    rights grounds. He was 19 years old then and an adult.  Paragraph 362ZC
    (unaccompanied asylum-seeking child leave) was no longer applicable.

19. In the refusal letter, the respondent accepted that the  appellant  was
    an Albanian citizen but rejected his claim to have been trafficked into
    drug cultivation, or to have escaped from his traffickers.  As his core
    account was rejected, she also did not accept that the appellant  would
    be at risk on return from the claimed traffickers.   She  identified  a
    number of inconsistencies in the appellant's accounts which underpinned
    a negative credibility finding.

20.  Even  had  the  appellant's  claim  been  accepted  as  credible,  the
    respondent considered  that  he  had  the  option  of  accessing  state
    protection on return and/or exercising an  internal  relocation  within
    Albania away from the risk areas relied upon: Domje (Tirana) and  Fush�
    Lur�.   Surrogate international  protection  was  not  required.    The
    humanitarian protection, and Article 2 and 3 ECHR claims fell with  the
    asylum claim.

21. The Secretary of State also rejected the appellant's Article 8  private
    and family life claim.  In March 2019, he was  a  single  man  with  no
    partner, who had spent only  three  of  his  19  years  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  He had not demonstrated very  significant  obstacles  to  his
    reintegration in Albania  on  return  (paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)).   The
    appellant still had family  in  Albania,  and  was  a  native  Albanian
    speaker.

22. There were no exceptional  circumstances  for  which  leave  to  remain
    should be given outside the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended).

23. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

First-tier Tribunal decision

24. First-tier Judge Sullivan also found the appellant's evidence  to  lack
    credibility.  The appellant's account now was that  he  wanted  nothing
    further to do with his family as they had failed to support him and ill-
    treated him in the past.   That  contrasted  poorly  with  his  account
    earlier that he had returned to his  family  home  after  escaping  the
    traffickers, lived mostly with them until he left for Italy in November
    2015, and that his father had accompanied him on the first part of  his
    journey and arranged and paid for his travel.

25. At the hearing, the appellant raised a 'new matter':  he  had  begun  a
    relationship with an EEA national, whom he planned to marry.  The  Home
    Office Presenting Officer declined to give consent on the  respondent's
    behalf for that to be dealt with as part  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    appeal and it was therefore excluded from consideration in  the  First-
    tier Tribunal and I am also not seised of it.

26. The First-tier Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal and the appellant
    appealed to the Upper Tribunal.

Permission to appeal

27. The appellant's grounds of appeal contended that the  First-tier  Judge
    had erred in her approach to the impact and significance of  his  young
    age and vulnerability.  Whilst it was right that at [18] the judge  had
    referred to the Joint Presidential Guidance Note No.2 of 2010, she  did
    not appear to have given weight when assessing credibility to his youth
    when the screening and asylum interviews took place.

28. The appellant relied on the guidance given by the Upper Tribunal in  JL
    (medical reports: credibility) China [2013] UKUT  00145  (IAC)  and  in
    particular the error identified  at  [26]  in  relation  to  the  Joint
    Presidential Guidance  Note:  an  appellant's  youth  or  vulnerability
    should inform assessment of discrepancies in the written record.

29. The second ground related to the treatment of the expert evidence of Dr
    Enkeleida Tahiraj, a senior fellow at the London School  of  Economics,
    which related to the plausibility of the  appellant's  account  of  his
    history in context of her expert knowledge  of  Albania  and  of  other
    academic resources.

30. The appellant argued that the First-tier  Tribunal  had  committed  the
    Mibanga error by reaching a credibility finding without considering the
    expert evidence, which was material to the outcome.  The appellant also
    cited Y v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2006]  EWCA  Civ
    1223 at [27] in the judgment of Lord  Justice  Keene,  with  whom  Lord
    Justices Ward and Carnwath agreed: a decision maker must 'look  through
    the spectacles provided by the information he has about  conditions  in
    the country in question'.

31. Finally, the appellant argued that the First-tier  Judge's  credibility
    findings were speculative and that the matters relied upon were not put
    to the appellant in his oral evidence.

32. First-tier Judge Osborne granted permission to appeal on the basis that
    'in an otherwise careful decision, it is at  least  arguable  that  the
    judge failed to consider, or even mention, the evidence of  the  expert
    Dr Tahiraj, upon whose evidence the  appellant  relied'.   All  grounds
    were to be argued.

Rule 24 Reply

33. There was no Rule 24 reply.

Error of law decision

34. On 22 January 2020, the Upper Tribunal found a material error of law in
    the First-tier Judge's decision  in  overlooking  the  evidence  of  Dr
    Tahiraj, and set aside the decision for remaking in the Upper Tribunal.





Procedural matters

35. On Friday 13 January 2020, there  was  an  abortive  remaking  hearing.
    The appellant appeared without a  representative,  having  received  an
    email from Virgo Solicitors to say that Counsel would not be attending.
     An apologetic email  was  received  from  Mr  Glenn  Corney  of  Virgo
    Solicitors explaining that  the  hearing  had  not  been  entered  into
    Counsel's diary.  The hearing was adjourned, with costs reserved.  On 3
    April 2020, there was a case management review by  BTMeetMe.  Ms  Jones
    said that the appellant and his partner had now  attended  their  local
    Register Office and given notice of intention to marry.

36. Ms Jones applied again for Article 8 family life between the  appellant
    and his EEA citizen wife to be included in  the  substantive  remaking.
    Mr Melvin maintained the Secretary of State's objection, with reference
    to section 85(5) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002
    (as amended).  Absent the consent of the Secretary of State, the  Upper
    Tribunal is not seised of any issue regarding the  appellant's  private
    and family life with his EEA citizen wife.  The appellant has  made  an
    application to be recognised as the spouse of an EEA national.

37. The Upper Tribunal  remains  seised  of  the  international  protection
    appeal, and of the appellant's Article 8 ECHR claims so far as they  do
    not arise from his relationship with his now wife.

38. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the  Upper  Tribunal
    on 12 October 2020 for substantive remaking.

Appellant's evidence

39. The appellant adopted his witness statement and confirmed that he could
    understand English sufficiently well to check it himself.  The  content
    of the witness statement was true.  Ms Jones,  his  Counsel,  confirmed
    that the appellant's English was excellent: the appellant said  he  had
    taken GCSE examinations here and could  read  and  write  English  very
    well, but asked  for  an  Albanian  interpreter  in  case  he  did  not
    understand something, or needed help with terminology.

40. The appellant gave his evidence in Albanian, with a  short  break  when
    the interpreter lost connection.  The appellant needed a break by then.
     Otherwise, he coped well and was calm and responsive in  his  evidence
    to the Tribunal.

41. The appellant's oral evidence, both in chief and in  cross-examination,
    was largely consistent with the account summarised  at  [2]-[12]  above
    and will not be repeated here.  He confirmed that he had been  able  to
    renew his Albanian passport, and get an identity card, at the  Albanian
    Embassy in London.  He needed them for his marriage. He  confirmed  the
    date of his marriage to his EEA partner as 4 September 2020 and that he
    had made an EEA spouse application.

42. Ms Isherwood asked the appellant about his private life in  the  United
    Kingdom.  The appellant said that in the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing
    bundle, there were statements from  friends,  staff  and  teachers  (at
    pages 49ff).  Ms Isherwood did not cross-examine on those  letters  and
    they stand unchallenged.

43. In relation to his educational achievements in the United Kingdom,  the
    appellant said he had included all the qualifications he  had  obtained
    here, including Level  1  of  a  bricklaying  qualification.   Level  2
    required site experience, and he was not allowed to work, so he had not
    been able to advance further with that practical qualification.  He had
    tried hard to build a decent life here and did not want to return.

44. The appellant denied having come to the United Kingdom only  to  better
    himself, asserting that he remained afraid of the traffickers.  He  did
    not know whether they were still interested in him,  but  he  had  been
    badly frightened  when  they  cut  his  finger  for  trying  to  leave.
    Although they had  provided  medical  treatment,  the  tendons  in  the
    appellant's finger were still damaged now.  He had not seen a doctor in
    the United Kingdom about them.

45. The appellant said that when he escaped the traffickers,  he  took  the
    passport they had helped him get, and the money  from  his  pillowcase,
    and ran, with everyone else, until a minibus picked them  up  and  took
    them back to Tirana.   He handed over the money to his mother  and  did
    not use it to pay for the onward journey.

46. The appellant was asked about his journey in 2015, to  Italy,  then  by
    train to France, and by lorry to the United Kingdom.   His  father  had
    arranged it because the appellant was in danger,  but  had  accompanied
    him only as far as Italy.  It had not  occurred  to  the  appellant  to
    approach the Italian or French authorities for asylum; he just  did  as
    he had been told to do, and got on the train, and then a lorry.

47. The appellant said he had not tried to contact his family  in  Albania.
    They had always used him, and he did not want to contact them.  He  had
    run away because he was  frightened.   His  parents  and  other  family
    members were still at the same addresses in Albania, as far as he knew,
    but he did not know whether  they  had  had  any  difficulty  with  the
    traffickers, because of his lack of contact with them.

48. There was no re-examination.

49. It was agreed that there would be written  closing  submissions  and  I
    reserved my decision.

Documentary evidence before the Upper Tribunal

Appellant's qualifications

50. The bundle contains a copy of the following documents:

       .  October  2016  -  April  2017:  Haringey  Education  and  Business
         Partnership certificate of successful completion of an  ESF  funded
         Work Related Learning and Personal Development Programme;

       . June 2016: Pearson  Edexcel  ESOL  Skills  for  Life,  Entry  Level
         Personal  and  Social  Development,  Functional  Skills   Level   2
         Mathematics, and BTEC  Entry  Level  IT  Users  at  level  3,  with
         appropriate supporting credits;

       . July  2017:  Pearson  EdExcel  Level  1  for  Personal  and  Social
         Development,  and  for  ESOL  Skills  for  Life,  with  appropriate
         supporting credits;

       . Undated:  British Safety Council Level I award in Health and Safety
         in a Construction Environment;

       . 2017/2018: Reading Ahead certificate of achievement in reading.

       . February 2018:  City and Guilds Level 1 Diploma in Bricklaying with
         Level  2  Health,  safety  and  welfare   in   Construction,   with
         appropriate supporting credits;

       . June 2018: English language Grade 2 AQA GCSE and  Pearson  Level  1
         Mathematics with appropriate supporting credits;

    It is clear from these documents that the appellant has used  his  time
    in the United Kingdom wisely, acquiring basic IT  skills,  mathematics,
    English, bricklaying, and social and financial skills  and  preparation
    for work.

Letters of support

51. There are letters of support from all members of the appellant's wife's
    family, saying they approve of him, and that he is smart,  hardworking,
    kind and respectful and has achieved a lot academically.  He  would  be
    an asset to the United Kingdom if he remained here, they say.

52. Two letters from the appellant's now wife, one undated, and one dated 3
    October 2019, say that their relationship began in September  2016  and
    is a serious and permanent relationship.  She says that she  loves  him
    deeply but is intent  on  getting  her  qualifications  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  She is working hard to learn her third language, English, but
    does not feel she could  adapt  to  living  in  Albania,  or  would  be
    accepted there.  They had raised each other here,  in  the  absence  of
    their parents.  They understand each other very well.

53. A letter from the appellant's former roommate says that  he  thinks  of
    the appellant as a  brother,  and  has  watched  his  personal  growth,
    ambition and development.  He learned English really fast, and is smart
    and hard working.  He admires the appellant's maturity and kindness.

54. A  letter  of  support  from  Mark  Darby  at  the  Atlantic  Care  and
    Accommodation Division reflects the appellant's conduct at the  24-hour
    semi-supported unit where he lived between November 2015 and  September
    2017.  He has  kept  in  touch  with  the  appellant  subsequently  and
    considered him a pleasure  to  work  with,  well  liked,  and  full  of
    potential  and  growth.   He  was  dedicated  to  his  education,  with
    excellent punctuality, attendance and superlative grades.  He  inspired
    the other young people to be like him, and continued to do so.

55. A letter from Haringey Sixth Form  College  sets  out  the  appellant's
    academic record, describing him as a serious and  hardworking  student,
    extremely motivated to improve his English and build a  future  in  the
    United Kingdom.  He had made rapid progress, was polite,  friendly  and
    kind, and a very popular student.  He was continuously  respectful  and
    helpful to the teachers and students at the College.   Letters from his
    ESOL teachers at the same college describe him  as  showing  curiosity,
    interest and determination to overcome significant difficulties,  being
    valued and respected by teachers and students alike, and working  hard,
    making a clear effort to integrate with British values and society.  He
    developed 'firm ICT  skills'  and  worked  well  in  mathematics.   His
    teachers were sad to say goodbye to him and wished him well, seeing for
    him a bright future in manual trades in which he had developed skills.

56. A letter from Atlantic Lodge Supported Living said  the  appellant  was
    provided with semi-independent accommodation within the community. When
    he became too old to be permitted any  more  education,  the  appellant
    went at least twice a week to the library with his  now  wife,  who  is
    described as 'also highly driven  by  education'.   The  appellant  was
    tidy,  with  good  personal  hygiene  and  highly  organised.   He  was
    confident in chasing  up  concerns  with  the  relevant  professionals:
    local general medical practitioners, opticians, dentist and so on.

57. The appellant would always go the extra mile, helping people round  him
    to move up with him. He cooked capably for  himself,  his  fianc�e  and
    friends.  He wanted to pursue a career in business, and in due  course,
    to own his own restaurant or food shop.  The appellant  had  undertaken
    voluntary office  and  administration  work  at  Atlantic  Lodge  in  a
    professional,  reliable  and  diligent  manner.    He  was  stable  and
    independent.

58. The appellant had stayed in touch with the other young people he met in
    the supported accommodation, who came from places such as Sierra Leone,
    Afghanistan and Turkey.  They met  at  least  once  a  month,  and  the
    appellant saved money so as to be  able  to  contribute  to  the  joint
    restaurant meal or activity they organised.

Dr Enkeleida Tahiraj's report

59. Dr Tahiraj's report is dated 2 October 2019.  She has both British  and
    Albanian citizenships and has researched human  rights,  social  policy
    and employment, as well as engaging men and boys  in  reducing  gender-
    based violence in  Albania,  between  2012-2016,  including  in-country
    research.   As a senior consultant for  UNDP  and  UNICEF,  she  helped
    draft the National Strategy for Social Inclusion and Social  Protection
    in Albania between 2013 and 2020.    She  has  lectured  at  University
    College London and is a  member  of  the  London  School  of  Economics
    academic network on social cohesion in  south-eastern  Europe.   It  is
    clear that Dr Tahiraj is well placed to assist the Upper Tribunal  from
    her experience and research.

60. Dr Tahiraj recognised that assessment of the credibility of an  account
    was not within her remit.  The appellant's  account  of  working  as  a
    child was plausible, although child labour illegal in  Albania.   Child
    labour was mostly used in agriculture, though some children  worked  in
    mines or construction, or were exploited in  drug  trafficking  and  on
    cannabis farms.  Those children who were forced to work unlawfully were
    not paid and were exploited.   Missing school  was  common,  for  those
    engaged in work for their families.

61. That said, there was  very  little  if  any  reference  to  boys  being
    trafficked, although some was emerging now.  The data was  still  being
    examined.  Children and young males were  among  those  trafficked  for
    delivering or cultivating drugs, with  organised  crime  groups  moving
    victims  relatively  freely  across  porous  borders,  normally   using
    deception rather than force.

62. Engaging children to work in drug cultivation or delivery led  to  them
    being considered as 'lucky to be  able  to  bring  home  some  income'.
    There was no stigma associated with such work: they  were  not  killing
    anyone, just finding a means to survive.   People were obliged to  take
    this work because there were no jobs.

63. Child workers travelled on minibuses to and from  work,  and  were  not
    allowed a phone or camera with them.  The minibuses had no  windows  or
    number plates, and were always accompanied by  an  outrider  car.   The
    police knew them.  Sometimes, family members were directly  responsible
    for the recruitment and exploitation of male trafficking victims.  They
    would often then be taken into an European Union country  by  a  family
    member, after which they would connect to a destination country or seek
    asylum in Europe.

64. Fush� Lur�, where the appellant said he had worked on a cannabis  farm,
    was known for cannabis  production.   In  2015,  around  the  time  the
    appellant made his escape  from  the  farm,  the  Albanian  police  had
    carried out an operation called 'Autumn in Lur�' and arrested 4 people,
    sequestering 11 kg of marijuana, firearms and munitions.

65. There was significant corruption around the issue of passports  and  it
    was not unlikely that the gang could have obtained a passport  for  the
    appellant, even though he was still a minor and  parental  consent  was
    required.

Asylos/ARC Report: Albania: trafficked boys and young men [May 2019]

66. This report intends a comprehensive study of the position of trafficked
    boys and young men in Albania, seeking to fill gaps in the  country  of
    origin literature.  It is a joint project between Asylos  and  the  ARC
    Foundation, formerly known as

67. Both Asylos and ARC seek to provide country  evidence  to  support  the
    credibility of individual testimony  and/or  prove  persecution,  where
    refugees and their legal representatives find it  difficult  to  access
    that  information.   ARC  says  that  "accurate,  reliable,   relevant,
    current,  objective,  traceable  and  transparent  Country  of   Origin
    Information (COI) ...[is] central to refugee  status  determination  in
    order to inform decision makers about conditions in  the  countries  of
    origin  of  asylum  applicants  and  to  assist  them  in  establishing
    objective criteria as to whether an asylum claim is well founded".

68. The Asylos/ARC report is a collection  of  international  sources.   It
    acknowledges a dearth of evidence or analysis  of  the  trafficking  of
    boys and young men in Albania.  In January 2019, Dr  Edlira  Haxhiymeri
    was interviewed for the report.  She acknowledged that no research  had
    been done about the profiles  of  trafficked  boys  and  young  men  in
    Albania, but her opinion was that the risk factors for  trafficking  of
    Albanian boys included  poverty,  low  education,  physical  or  mental
    disabilities, domestic violence and/or sexual abuse within the  family,
    or an existing blood feud.  A source at Caritas Albania agreed that the
    same criteria were applicable to Albanian boys. Other factors mentioned
    in the Asylos/ARC report, such as sexual orientation, gender  identity,
    or Roma or Egyptian ethnicity, are not relevant to the present  appeal.
     Roma and Egyptian boys  are  considered  to  be  at  primary  risk  of
    trafficking.

69. The  family  background  of  trafficked  boys  tended  to  be  abusive,
    neglectful or unsuitable for their needs, characterised by  verbal  and
    physical abuse.  Sometimes one parent was dead  and  the  other  unable
    properly to care for the child; some boys had been  abandoned  by  both
    parents.  A lack of stable family support was a factor.  Boys living on
    the street were at enhanced risk, being targeted by adults and  seduced
    into forced criminality or sexual exploitation for shelter,  food,  and
    sometimes a little money (see Different and Equal: Falling through  the
    cracks! The trafficking of men and boys in Albania, January 2015, cited
    in the Asylos/ARC report).

70. Many other sources cited in the  Asylos/ARC  report  are  to  the  same
    effect. Poverty, of the boy or the family,  is  a  known  risk  factor,
    particularly where children were homeless and living on the street. The
    link to domestic violence is emphasised again in this context.

71. An interview  conducted  by  ARC  with  James  Simmonds-Read  from  the
    children society says that domestic violence  has  been  the  case  for
    every single Albanian boy he worked  with,  experiencing  violence  and
    witnessing violence to siblings and their mother, and  being  exploited
    very young due to family members not wanting to look after them.

72. Professor Haxhiymeri is quoted as saying that there was an  expectation
    that a boy would begin working and supporting his family from  the  age
    of 14, and that any 'offer of work'  presented  an  opportunity  to  do
    that.  Boys in this position did not perceive themselves as  'victims':
    they and their families saw themselves as 'working'.

73. Trafficked boys had a much lower education level, usually  having  been
    at school for only 5� years, while on average, Albanian  boys  attended
    school for almost 12  years.   The  interruption  to  schooling,  which
    increased their risk of trafficking,  was  normally  a  consequence  of
    other circumstances such as  poverty,  an  unstable  family  situation,
    early engagement into child work, and so on.

74. Research  from  the  Children's  Society,  and  an  interview  with  Dr
    Stephanie Schwandner-Sievers,  confirmed  that  assessment,  qualifying
    lack of education as inability to access  education.    Dr  Schwandner-
    Sievers said that there was a strong expectation that men would provide
    for their families, and if they could  see  no  other  route,  economic
    stress might drive boys to criminal enterprises in order to earn  money
    for their families. The profile of a  typical  trafficker  was  another
    young man, often a relative, and often living abroad.

75. The United Kingdom Home Office Fact-Finding Mission  acknowledged  that
    parents were keen for their children to go abroad and were sending them
    younger and younger, to obtain remittances to keep the  country  going.
    Families were complicit in the trafficking,  or  turned  a  blind  eye,
    convincing themselves it was not the case, often coupled with financial
    compensation for the parents. Threats and  violence  were  used  on  to
    force the boys to grow cannabis, even if they were groomed rather  than
    kidnapped into the criminal enterprise.

76. Professor Haxhiymeri explained in her January 2019  interview  that  in
    some  cases,  internal  trafficking  was  a  test  for  later  external
    trafficking:

         "I have heard of cases that have been trafficked  internally  first
         and after that externally.  So, in a way, they have been tested  as
         to  whether  they  are  useful,  and  after  that  they  have  been
         trafficked externally."

77.  Albania has ratified the two optional protocols to the  Convention  on
    the Rights  of  the  Child,  which  cover  child  trafficking,  selling
    children, child sex work, pornography and other  issues.  In  2006,  it
    also ratified the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Action  against
    Trafficking in Human Beings. The Asylos/ARC report sets out  at  length
    the legislative framework which has been provided in Albania to protect
    children.  At 3.3, it considers the effectiveness of that  legislation,
    which does not cover the trafficking of children within the borders  of
    Albania, or forced labour.  Caritas Albania agreed that  the  framework
    was in place, but in practice it was not enforced.  Children  were  not
    recognised as being in a situation of being trafficked.

78. There was a  low  conviction  rate  on  prosecutions  for  trafficking,
    although Albania was in the top five non-European Union  countries  for
    registered victims of trafficking.  There were only 21  convictions  in
    2015 and 2 in the first half of 2016.  The Council  of  Europe's  GRETA
    Report in 2016 criticised the prosecution rate as 'rather low',  partly
    due to the non-recognition of children as victims of trafficking.  Most
    of  the  prosecutions  concerned  adult  victims  of  trafficking,  not
    children.

79. An anonymous source, interviewed in 2019 for the Asylos/ARC report said
    that in Albania there was complete denial that boys and young  men  are
    trafficked:

         "There is almost complete denial about the  possibility  that  boys
         and  young  men  are  being  trafficked  into  things  like  labour
         exploitation and forced criminality. There really is a deeply  held
         denial that these things are happening and a belief that young  men
         are making it up or that people are doing it willingly-a  different
         viewpoint on young adulthood.

         Predominantly absolutely denial that it even exists as a phenomenon
         and the belief that young men are falsifying this information while
         migrating for economic reasons and a belief  that  this  is  always
         facilitated by their family. So I would say that that very  clearly
         creates a culture-if something doesn't exist according to those who
         are supposed to be identifying it then it's going to continue  with
         impunity."

80. Dr Haxhiymeri said that none of the young men she worked with had  ever
    gone through the prosecution process:  the  police  do  not  prosecute.
    Although an NRM mechanism existed in Albania, police  often  associated
    trafficking with movement and were unlikely to identify  as  trafficked
    victims recruited and exploited in the same region of Albania. Shelters
    existed for child victims of trafficking, but  the  preferred  approach
    was to take the child back to their family and support the  family,  or
    to place the children in orphanages.

81. A 2017 research paper by Dr Tahiraj, quoted in  the  Asylos/ARC  report
    said that family was the fundamental source of personal, financial  and
    social security in Albania, and lack of family  support  therefore  put
    returnees at risk of severe poverty, leading to re-trafficking.  Public
    health  services  were  inadequate  and  available  only   for   severe
    psychological  problems,  with  psychotherapy  only  available  in  the
    private sector.  The public health  sector  was  not  easy  to  access,
    particularly away from a person's home region.

82.  Repatriated  young  male  victims  of  trafficking  would   experience
    significant difficulties, since extensive family support  was  unlikely
    to be available, because they had brought shame on the family.

83.  Most  boys  needed  an  identity  card  and  other  basic   documents.
    Sometimes, they needed legal help  to  ensure  non-punishment  for  the
    crimes their  exploiters  forced  them  to  commit.   Those  with  poor
    education, self-care or life skills,  from  having  been  in  a  street
    situation, fared worse.  An anonymous source  interviewed  in  December
    2018 and January  2019  said  that  Tirana,  the  capital,  had  better
    support, with free medical care, housing and other  local  programs  to
    support their reintegration, and more job opportunities.  Dr Haxhiymeri
    and  Dr  Schwandner-Sievers  disagreed,  saying  that  there   was   no
    distinction between Tirana and the rest of the country, and  that  many
    families survived in Albania only because of remittances from abroad.

84. Mr Simmonds-Read said that the ability to return to family  members  in
    Albania could be either protective, or a risk factor, depending on  the
    original family circumstances.  Individuals could be found anywhere  in
    Albania, if the gangs were interested in doing so.   Other contributors
    thought the same, but there is no extant research on re-trafficking  of
    boys and young men.

Home Office Fact-Finding Mission and CPIN [2017]

85. There is a dearth of recent investigation by the  Home  Office  of  the
    trafficking of Albanian boys and young men.  The July 2017 Home  Office
    CPIN does not deal in detail with the position of boys and  young  men.
    It does state that transfer of civil registration to a new community of
    residence requires  documentation  to  demonstrate  that  a  person  is
    legally domiciled in Albania.

86. The CPIN asserts that most persons fearing non-state or  'rogue'  state
    actors could exercise an internal relocation option to another part  of
    Albania, which would normally be reasonable, depending  on  the  nature
    and origin of the threat, and the person's personal circumstances.

87. In late 2017, the Home Office sent a Fact-Finding Mission to Albania in
    2017, whose findings were published in 2018.  During a meeting with  Dr
    Rifat Demalija, programme manager of the Centre for Youth Progress  NGO
    in K�kes, and a civil society activist, she is recorded as saying  that
    there was a high rate of unemployment in the K�kes region.

88. Dr Demalija said that trafficking of young women and  girls,  and  boys
    under  18,  was  one  of  the  most  serious  issues  in  the   region.
    Prosecution  rates  were  low  and   domestic   violence   a   problem.
    Remittances were not sent back from the United Kingdom much any longer:
    the children used to but now 'they do not know  or  do  not  care',  or
    perhaps they were not working.  The Director of Social Services of  the
    Municipality of Tirana, when interviewed in November  2017,  said  that
    they sometimes received referrals for boys, as well as girls, and had a
    separate free counselling telephone line for boys.

89. There is no other mention in the Fact-Finding  Mission  report  of  the
    position of boys and young men as victims of trafficking.

Definition of human trafficking

90. The Secretary of State accepted in MS (Pakistan) v Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2020] UKSC 9  that her guidance to caseworkers
    and the NRM procedure where she is the sole Competent  Authority,  must
    comply with the definition of human trafficking at  Article  4  of  the
    Council of Europe Convention on Action  against  Trafficking  in  Human
    Beings [2012] (ECAT), although ECAT has not been formally  incorporated
    into United Kingdom law.

91. Article 4 defines 'trafficking in human beings'  at  Article  4(a)  and
    definitions at Article 4(b) -4(e) are also relevant:

         "ARTICLE 4 - Definitions

         For the purposes of this Convention:

      a)  "Trafficking  in  human  beings"  shall  mean   the   recruitment,
         transportation, transfer, harbouring  or  receipt  of  persons,  by
         means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion,  of
         abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power  or  of  a
         position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments
         or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control  over
         another person, for the purpose of exploitation.

         Exploitation shall include, at a  minimum,  ...  forced  labour  or
         services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the
         removal of organs;

         (b)  The consent of a victim of "trafficking in  human  beings"  to
         the intended exploitation set forth in  subparagraph  (a)  of  this
         article shall be irrelevant where any of the  means  set  forth  in
         subparagraph (a) have been used;

         (c)   The  recruitment,  transportation,  transfer,  harbouring  or
         receipt of a  child  for  the  purpose  of  exploitation  shall  be
         considered "trafficking in human beings"  even  if  this  does  not
         involve any of the means set forth  in  subparagraph  (a)  of  this
         article;

         (d)  "Child" shall mean any person under eighteen years of age;

         (e)  "Victim" shall mean any  natural  person  who  is  subject  to
         trafficking in human beings as defined in this article."  [Emphasis
         added]

Modern Slavery Act 2015

92. Section 2 of the Modern Slavery  Act  2015  now  defines  the  criminal
    offence of human trafficking:

         "2.  Human trafficking

         (1)  A  person  commits  an  offence  if  the  person  arranges  or
         facilitates the travel of another person ("V") with  a  view  to  V
         being exploited.

         (2)  It is irrelevant whether V consents to the travel  (whether  V
         is an adult or a child).

         (3)  A person may in particular arrange or facilitate V's travel by
         recruiting  V,  transporting  or  transferring  V,  harbouring   or
         receiving V, or transferring or exchanging control over V.

         (4)  A person arranges or facilitates V's travel with a view  to  V
         being exploited only if-

             (a)  the person intends to exploit  V  (in  any  part  of  the
             world) during or after the travel, or

             (b)  the person knows or ought to know that another person  is
             likely to exploit V (in any part of the world) during or after
             the travel."

93. The definition of 'exploitation', where the person is a minor, is to be
    found in section 3 of the Act:

         "3.  Meaning of exploitation

         (1)  For the purposes of section 2 a person is  exploited  only  if
         one or more of the following subsections apply in relation  to  the
         person. ...

         Securing services etc from children and vulnerable persons

         (6)  Another person uses or  attempts  to  use  the  person  for  a
         purpose within paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of subsection (5),  having
         chosen him or her for that purpose on the grounds that -

             (a)  he or she is a child, ..., and

             (b)  an adult ... would be likely to refuse  to  be  used  for
             that purpose."

MS (Pakistan)

94. The United Kingdom is party to both  the  2000  Palermo  Protocol  (the
    Protocol to  Prevent,  Suppress  and  Punish  Trafficking  in  Persons,
    especially  Women  and  Children,  supplementing  the  United   Nations
    Convention against Transnational Organised Crime) and the 2005  Council
    of Europe Convention on Action  against  Trafficking  in  Human  Beings
    ("ECAT").

95. In MS, at [15] in the judgment of Lady Hale, President of  the  Supreme
    Court, with whom Lord Kerr JSC, Lady Black JSC,  Lord  Lloyd-Jones  JSC
    and  Lord  Briggs  JSC  agreed,  the  Supreme  Court  held   that   the
    'essentially factual' question of whether a person had been  trafficked
    was one in which the First-tier Tribunal and the  Upper  Tribunal  were
    better placed than was the Competent  Authority  to  decide  whether  a
    person had been trafficked.

96. The Upper Tribunal is  not  bound  by  a  negative  Conclusive  Grounds
    decision by the Competent Authority, which will have been made  to  the
    higher standard of balance of probabilities,  but  must  determine  for
    itself whether an appellant is a victim of trafficking before going  on
    to decide whether that creates a risk on return, on the  facts  of  the
    appeal.

Submissions

Appellant's submissions

97. In submissions for the appellant,  Ms  Jones  relied  on  her  skeleton
    argument of 8 October 2020.  She submitted that  the  appellant  was  a
    credible witness and that the problem of proof was  compounded  in  the
    case of children as noted in the 1994 UNHCR  Guidelines  on  Protection
    and Care.  The appellant's account was both  internally  plausible  and
    externally  consistent  with  what  she  described  as  a  plethora  of
    available objective evidence that children in Albania are exploited and
    subjected to forced labour, and the ARC Foundation Report.

98. The appellant's father was a handyman and his mother a housewife.   The
    family needed money and he had been sent  out  to  work,  and  to  help
    support the family, when he was only 11.   He  was  currently  in  poor
    mental health being stressed, depressed and sad, which would affect his
    ability to cope on return to Albania.  The Upper Tribunal in AM and  BM
    held that not all victims of trafficking might be able to  exercise  an
    internal relocation option.

99. The appellant would rely on the Home Office  CPIN  of  July  2017,  the
    Report of the Fact-Finding Mission to Albania in 2017, and on TD and AD
    (Trafficked women) CG [2016] UKUT  00092  (IAC)  as  to  re-trafficking
    risks.  Trafficking remained a  serious  issue.   Dr  Tahiraj's  report
    corroborated the appellant's account and also assisted the Tribunal  in
    relation to sufficiency of protection.

100. In her written closing submissions, Ms Jones argued that  there  was  a
    marked gap in authoritative findings about trafficking of male victims,
    and an absence of  Home  Office  policy  recognising  male  victims  of
    trafficking in Albania as a particular social  group.  The  appellant's
    account in cross-examination was consistent with his account throughout
    and supportive of his credibility overall, as well as being  consistent
    with all the country evidence.

101. The appellant's evidence about his inability to send  money  home  from
    the 'tomato farm' work was supportive of his account of being compelled
    to work, rather than simply employed.   The involvement of a doctor  to
    repair his damaged tendons did not indicate that the two  men  had  any
    personal care for him: it was likely  that  they  wanted  him  to  keep
    working and making money for them.

102. Dr Tahiraj's evidence was that individuals  who  outed  crime  networks
    were at risk of retaliation:  the refusal letter failed to take account
    of the local and country context.  In Albania, there was a  failure  to
    recognise the trafficking of young men as an issue at all.

103. The legislative framework had major  difficulties  with  implementation
    and there was corruption within the police force and government bodies.
     Fear  of  self-incrimination,  and  collusion  by  local  police  with
    criminal gangs reduced the effectiveness of  domestic  protection.   In
    reality, the appellant would not be able to access  judicial  remedies,
    nor would there be  a  sufficiency  of  protection  for  him  from  the
    Albanian authorities.

104. The appellant's English language and bricklaying  skills  would  be  of
    little advantage to him in Albania as he had no support network  there.



105. As to internal relocation, the evidence of  Ms  Schwandner  Sievers  in
    the  ARC  Foundation  report  was  that  it  was  impossible  to   live
    anonymously anywhere in Albania, for cultural reasons, because  it  was
    such a small country.  Dr Tahiraj made the same  point.   Although  the
    appellant had an identity card now, he would have to go  to  his  local
    municipality office to apply to change residence.

106. Overall, returning the appellant to Albania would breach his Article  2
    and 3 ECHR  rights  as  well  as  the  United  Kingdom's  international
    obligations under the Refugee Convention and in  default,  in  European
    Union law (humanitarian protection).

107. As  regards  Article  8  ECHR,  even  excluding  consideration  of  his
    marriage, the appellant had demonstrated very significant obstacles  to
    his reintegration in Albania, and he  had  submitted  numerous  letters
    confirming his private life and his friendships here.

108. Ms Jones asked the Tribunal  to  substitute  a  decision  allowing  the
    appeal.

Respondent's submissions

109. For  the  respondent,  Ms  Isherwood  submitted  that  the  appellant's
    account lacked credibility.  Ms Isherwood relied on section  8  of  the
    Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of  Claimants,  etc.)  Act  2004  and
    argued that the appellant's admitted failure to claim asylum  in  Italy
    or France further damaged his credibility.   Ms Isherwood  argued  that
    even if the Tribunal accepted that the  appellant's  account  had  been
    consistent, applying TK (Burundi) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2009] EWCA Civ 40 and Y & Anor (Sri Lanka) v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ 362, the  Upper  Tribunal
    should not suspend disbelief and believe everything he said.

110. Ms Isherwood relied  on  the  NRM  decision  in  August  2016  and  the
    discrepancies therein identified, although she accepted that,  applying
    DC (Trafficking protection/human rights appeals)  Albania  [2019]  UKUT
    00351 (IAC) at [34]-[35], the Upper Tribunal was entitled to  make  its
    own assessment of the credibility of the appellant's  account,  to  the
    lower standard of proof applicable in international protection appeals.



111. Ms Isherwood disputed Dr  Tahiraj's  assessment  that  the  appellant's
    account was plausible.  Dr Tahiraj's evidence  was  that  boys  in  the
    appellant's position worked without pay, but the appellant had accepted
    payment, which he was able to pass on to  his  family  members  on  his
    return.  The appellant worked long shifts but had time  to  himself  in
    between and some unspecified amenities.  The medical attention for  the
    appellant's cut  finger  also  indicated  that  the  appellant  was  an
    employee, not a forced worker. He was able to keep in contact with  his
    family, albeit not frequently.  There was no suggestion that his family
    had asked him to  send  money  home  to  assist  with  their  financial
    difficulties.

112. It was not credible that just two traffickers would be able to  control
    a gang of 10 boys for so long,  especially  as  they  were  not  always
    there.  As the two gang members came and went, the appellant would have
    had numerous opportunities for escape in the two years he worked on the
    cannabis farm.  When the appellant did leave,  he  left  with  all  the
    other workers and was able to take his new passport, which the gang had
    helped him obtain. It was unlikely that a trafficked child  would  have
    control of his passport.

113. There was no detail or  corroboration  of  the  claimed  abuse  by  his
    family members.  The appellant had returned home, and had no difficulty
    while staying with his parents before he left for Italy.  The  passport
    which he obtained would have required parental consent.

114. The appellant's account of  his  reasons  for  staying  in  the  United
    Kingdom focused on education, not on fear.  His evidence  was  that  he
    had no wish to contact any family members  in  Albania.  There  was  no
    medical evidence to support the appellant's claim to have depression or
    any other health consequence of the alleged  mistreatment  in  Albania.
    The appellant had been legally represented throughout, but his  witness
    statement only addressed the difference in dates for the 2-year  period
    he spent with the cannabis growing gang.   He  had  not  addressed  the
    other matters which concerned  the  Secretary  of  State  as  Competent
    Authority in her refusal letter.

115. The appellant had not been trafficked out of Albania to  Italy  by  his
    father.  The account of his departure, and of his safe  residence  with
    his family, or another family member, for about  two  months  preceding
    his departure, was sparse  and  should  be  given  little  weight.   Dr
    Tahiraj's report was inadequately sourced and should not be treated  as
    reliable.

116. In the alternative, even if the  appellant's  evidence  were  credible,
    the Albanian government was increasing its efforts  to  support  former
    victims of trafficking on return.  Ms Isherwood relied  on  TD  and  AD
    (trafficked women) Albania CG [2016] UKUT 92 (IAC).  The appellant  was
    a healthy young man who had acquired  some  additional  skills  in  the
    United Kingdom and Dr Tahiraj accepted  that  there  was  some  limited
    welfare and housing support available in Albania.

117. The respondent would rely  on  the  2019  US  State  Department  Report
    Trafficking in Persons: Albania as to the work of the  Anti-Trafficking
    Unit in Albania, although it stated that '[The] government  of  Albania
    does not fully meet  the  minimum  standards  for  the  elimination  of
    trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so'.

118. There were  victim  protection  efforts,  increased  training  for  the
    police, and data confidentiality, as well as state-run shelters and NGO
    shelters  with  police  or  private  security  protection.   That   was
    supported by the ARC report Albania - Trafficked Boys  and  Young  Men.
    The CPIN on Albanian  People  Trafficking  confirmed  that  there  were
    support mechanisms to assist those at risk of re-trafficking.

119. The appellant had travelled  to  Italy  on  his  own  genuine  Albanian
    passport and was able to renew it at the Albanian  Embassy  in  London.
    The appellant did not fear approaching the Albanian authorities: he had
    been able to approach the Albanian Embassy for documents, to facilitate
    his recent marriage.  As an adult, the appellant  was  entitled  to  an
    Albanian National Identity Card, and the Embassy had  issued  him  with
    one, as well as renewing his passport.

120. With these documents, the  appellant  would  be  able  to  register  in
    another town and obtain services. On return, the appellant could  reach
    out to his family in Albania for help, despite  the  break  in  contact
    with them since 2015.  There was a welfare system in  Albania,  if  the
    appellant was unable to find employment on return.

121. As to the risk of re-trafficking, the respondent  argued  that  it  was
    for the appellant to approach the authorities for protection.   He  was
    an adult who had benefited from education and skills  acquired  in  the
    United Kingdom and Albania had appropriate support mechanisms to enable
    him to reintegrate, despite his youth and his  claimed,  but  unproven,
    mental  health  issues.   There  were  no  significant   obstacles   to
    reintegration.

122. Nor, in human rights terms,  were  there  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    return, on the facts  of  this  appeal.  The  letters  of  support  and
    character references reflected  the  efforts  he  had  made  to  obtain
    qualifications in the  United  Kingdom,  and  that  the  appellant  was
    motivated and hard working.  His friendships could continue  after  his
    return to Albania.

123. Ms Isherwood asked that the  decision  in  this  appeal  be  remade  by
    dismissing the appellant's appeal on all grounds.

Analysis

124. Four questions need to be answered:

      1) is the appellant's account credible, or how much of it is credible;



      2) does that account establish a well-founded fear of  persecution  in
         his home area if returned today, taking account of the  sufficiency
         of domestic protection in Albania;

      3) is there an internal relocation option within Albania; and

      4) If none of the  above  are  applicable,  should  the  appellant  be
         granted leave to remain  on  Article  8  ECHR  grounds,  within  or
         outwith the Immigration Rules.

125. I have heard the appellant give  evidence,  and  examined  the  country
    evidence.  I have regard to section 8  of  the  2004  Act,  but  remind
    myself that in SM (Section 8: Judge's process) Iran [2005] UKAIT 00116,
    the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal held that:

         "Even where section 8 applies, an Immigration Judge should look  at
         the evidence as a whole and decide which parts are  more  important
         and which less. Section 8 does not require the behaviour  to  which
         it applies to be treated as the starting-point of the assessment of
         credibility."

126. Both during the hearing, and  in  assessing  credibility,  I  have  had
    regard to the appellant's  youth  and  vulnerability  at  all  material
    times, and to the lower standard of proof applicable  in  international
    protection claims.  The appellant's account of his history  in  Albania
    is entirely consistent with the country evidence before me.   The minor
    discrepancies relied upon by  the  respondent,  having  regard  to  the
    appellant's young age on arrival and his extremely limited education in
    Albania, are  not  such  as  to  render  his  account  one  that  lacks
    credibility. I therefore treat the appellant as a credible witness.

127. The appellant comes from a poor family.  He was forced to leave  school
    when he was 11, with just 6 years' schooling, and  required,  illegally
    under Albanian law, to help his family earn its living by selling small
    items on  the  street  and  in  a  market.   That  is  typical  of  the
    circumstances of  trafficked  boys  and  young  men  in  Albania.   The
    appellant was then recruited by the cannabis growers, and went to  work
    for them with his parents' approval.  Over 2 years,  he  accumulated  a
    substantial sum, which he was able to  give  to  his  mother  after  he
    returned.  He was then escorted by his father  to  Italy,  on  a  valid
    passport obtained by the traffickers, and travelled on  to  the  United
    Kingdom.

128. The appellant's parents, when sending him out to sell small  things  on
    the street at the age of 11, arguably themselves trafficked him.   They
    were aware of the offer for him to go and work, against  Albanian  law,
    in shepherding or 'tomato farming' and they accepted  the  proceeds  of
    his work when he returned.   That involved both providing benefits  and
    services for another person.  If the appellant's account  is  credible,
    which I find it to be, then the definition of human trafficking is met,
    both for his parents and certainly for the two gang members.

129. The next question is whether  the  appellant's  account  establishes  a
    well-founded fear of persecution if he is returned now.  The  appellant
    accepts that his humanitarian protection and Article  2/3  ECHR  claims
    stand or fall with the asylum claim.   The  appellant  has  established
    that he was a trafficked person in Albania, and  perhaps  also  in  the
    journey to Italy.  I remind myself that retrafficking is a  reality  in
    Albania.

130. The appellant's evidence, which I accept, is  that  he  does  not  know
    whether the traffickers remain interested in him:  he is no  longer  in
    contact with his  family  members.   If  returned,  he  would  have  to
    register his change of area with his home area, whether by going there,
    or by taking some other action in  the  area  of  internal  relocation.
    Albania is a very small country and if the traffickers wanted  to  find
    him, they would be able to do so, given the levels of corruption  which
    exist in the police  and  other  official  bodies.  I  accept  that  as
    consistent with the country evidence about internal relocation.

131. As  regards  state  protection,  while  the  Albanian  authorities  are
    willing, and have made some progress, the  country  evidence  does  not
    indicate that the standard of protection available now is sufficient to
    protect this appellant from retrafficking, or from being found  by  the
    previous traffickers, should they still have an interest in him

132. I note that the two areas where the appellant  lived  and  worked  were
    Domje, a suburb of Tirana, the capital city of Albania, and Fush� Lur�,
    about 4 hours'  drive  to  the  north-east.   The  respondent  has  not
    suggested any area of Albania where the  appellant  could  relocate  in
    safety, given the small size,  and  tribal  or  familial  structure  of
    Albania.  I reject Ms Isherwood's assertion that internal relocation is
    an option.

133.  I  am  satisfied  that  there  would  be  significant   obstacles   to
    reintegration in Albania for this young man. He has cut his  ties  with
    his family members there, who he assesses as having 'always  used  him'
    and he will not have the family  resources  to  enable  him  to  obtain
    employment and housing in an area of internal relocation.

134.  I  therefore  allow  the  appeal  on  asylum  grounds.    Humanitarian
    protection is not reached.  The question of Article 8  ECHR  protection
    is also not reached: had it been reached, I would have noted  that  the
    appellant had demonstrated that he had put all  of  his  energies  into
    study and that, leaving his recent relationship  out  of  consideration
    because that is a 'new matter', his private life would  not  have  been
    sufficient to enable leave to remain to be granted on  Article  8  ECHR
    grounds outside the Rules.



DECISION

135. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law.

    I set aside the previous decision.  I remake the decision  by  allowing
    the appeal on asylum grounds.
