                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Rose promulgated on 27th August  2014,  following  a  hearing  at
    Birmingham Sheldon Court on 19th August 2014.   In  the  determination,
    the judge  dismissed  the  appeal  of  Ezdehar  Emhemed  Elganga.   The
    Appellant subsequently applied for,  and  was  granted,  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Libya who was born on 7th September 1984.
     She is a medical doctor, currently practising in Libya, and  the  wife
    of Dr Bahaeldin Eljanen, also a medical practitioner,  working  in  the
    NHS in the  UK,  and  specialising  in  trauma  and  orthopaedics.   Dr
    Bahaeldin Eljanen, her Sponsor, is currently on discretionary leave  to
    remain in the UK.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim to enter the UK to be with Dr Eljanen was refused
    on the basis that she had  failed  to  have  an  undertaking  from  her
    sponsoring husband, that he will be responsible for her maintenance and
    accommodation, and that the relationship with  the  sponsoring  husband
    was not genuine  and  subsisting  (see  paragraph  3).   The  Appellant
    contested this strongly on  the  basis  that  her  sponsoring  husband,
    although currently  engaged  in  postgraduate  study  in  the  UK,  and
    although currently completing some exams and setting out and attempting
    to finish his training, was on a very respectable salary, such that she
    could be maintained by him, and it was certainly not correct  that  she
    and her sponsoring  husband  were  not  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge heard evidence from  the  sponsoring  husband,  Dr  Bahaeldin
    Eljanen that he was a "specialist doctor" working in the NHS Foundation
    Trust, where there were "about 25 consultants  engaged  in  trauma  and
    orthopaedics and about the same number of specialist doctors  and  also
    junior doctors.  He was a junior doctor.  If he  called  in  sick,  the
    hospital had to arrange a locum" (paragraph 7).  He was  vital  to  the
    services provided by the NHS.  His relationship was  genuine  with  his
    wife and he had returned to Libya in January 2014,  in  November  2012,
    and was in a genuine and subsisting relationship with her.

The Judge's Findings

 5. The judge considered the background carefully to  this  application  by
    the Appellant.  He noted that  the  sponsoring  husband,  Dr  Bahaeldin
    Eljanen had been in the UK since 2000, initially as a medical  student,
    and subsequently as a doctor.  He became an overstayer in  2003,  as  a
    consequence of his passport becoming lost  in  the  post,  but  he  was
    subsequently granted periods of discretionary leave to remain,  and  at
    the date of the Appellant's refusal, he had leave to remain  until  8th
    April 2014, and a further period of leave has since been  granted  (see
    paragraph 17).

 6. Before the judge, it was conceded by the Appellant's Counsel, that  she
    could not succeed under Appendix FM because her sponsoring husband  was
    on discretionary leave to remain, was not a British  citizen,  and  was
    not present or settled in the  UK,  or  with  refugee  leave,  or  with
    humanitarian protection.

 7. Accordingly, the Appellant's application could only be considered under
    Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention  (paragraph  18).   The  judge
    recorded how the Sponsor had explained in the witness statement that he
    had met his wife, the Appellant, at medical school in Libya.  They  had
    become engaged in February 2013, and the marriage took place  the  same
    month, and he had returned back to Libya on a number of occasions since
    the marriage.

 8. The judge concluded that,

         "I accept his account of his relationship with the Appellant.  I am
         satisfied that the relationship is genuine and subsisting and that,
         although their wedding ceremony has not yet taken place,  there  is
         family life between them, for the purposes of Article 8" (paragraph
         21).

 9. It was also noted by the judge that the Sponsor explained "that it  had
    never occurred to him that there would be any  problem  about  bringing
    his wife to the UK, given that he had leave to remain and  was  working
    as a doctor" and the judge accepted this evidence (paragraph 23).

10. In cross-examination, the Sponsor had accepted that he  could  practise
    as  a  doctor  in  Libya,  "although,  as  he  explained,   there   are
    difficulties currently because of the fighting that  is  taking  place"
    (paragraph 24).  In  his  witness  statement  (at  paragraph  10),  the
    Sponsor accepts that, "there is no doubt that  if  my  wife  is  denied
    entering the UK following this appeal, I will consider leaving  the  UK
    in order to be with her" and the Sponsor's evidence at the hearing  was
    that, "he would return to Libya, with  a  view  to  moving  to  another
    country in which he would be able to  continue  his  medical  training"
    (paragraph 24).

11. The judge further noted the role  played  by  the  Sponsor  in  the  UK
    working as a doctor, observing  that,  there  was  a  letter  from  the
    clinical director and the general manager of his NHS Foundation  Trust,
    to the effect that there were difficulties in recruiting people  to  do
    the job that the Sponsor  was  doing,  "and  the  fact  that  temporary
    doctors from locum agencies were being used, at a salary  nearly  three
    times that of the substantive post".

12. Moreover, there was a letter from  the  consultant  "referring  to  the
    Sponsor's work at the hospital, and stating that the Trust  would  like
    to employ him for  the  foreseeable  future"  (paragraph  26).   Having
    considered all these facts, which substantially fell in favour  of  the
    Appellant, the judge concluded that the  Appellant  could  not  succeed
    under Article 8 because under  Article  8(2)  the  Tribunal  must,  "in
    particular, have regard to the considerations listed in Section 117B of
    the 2002 Act.  Sub-Section 117B(1) provides  that  the  maintenance  of
    effective immigration controls is in the public interest".

13. Whilst the judge had regard  to  the  evidence  "that  the  Sponsor  is
    fulfilling a valuable role within the NHS, and the NHS  might  face  an
    additional cost if it were necessary to replace him, those  factors  do
    not reduce the  public  interest  identified  in  sub-Section  117B(1)"
    (paragraph 29).  The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

14. The grounds of application state that the judge's approach to Article 8
    ECHR was flawed because he treated Section  117B  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, as if  it  were  determinative  of  an
    appeal, whereas what the Section really pointed to was the weight to be
    given to various factors against the legitimate aim  being  pursued  in
    the proportionality assessment exercise.

15. On 7th October 2014, permission to appeal was granted on the basis that
    it was arguable that the economic interests of the United  Kingdom  are
    best served by  taking  some  steps  as  are  reasonably  necessary  to
    maintain the Sponsor in employment in the UK, and that if it  were  not
    for economic reasons, therefore reasons  of  public  safety  or  public
    health, both of which fall to be considered in the context  of  Article
    8(2) of ECHR".

Submissions

16. At the hearing before me on 5th December 2014, Mr Mackenzie,  appearing
    as Counsel on behalf of the Appellant, submitted  that  the  judge  had
    erred in law by simply taking the statement at paragraph 117B literally
    to the effect that "the maintenance of effective immigration control is
    in the public interest" because it was well-established that the public
    interest was not mutable.  Indeed, it was not fixed.  In  UE  (Nigeria)
    [2010] EWCA Civ 975, the court had held that

         "The weight to be attached to the public interest in removal of the
         person in question is not some fixed immutable amount.  It may vary
         from case to case, and where someone is of  greater  value  to  the
         community in this country, there exists a factor which reduced  the
         importance  of  maintaining  firm  immigration  control   in   this
         individual  case.   The  weight  to  be  given  to  that   aim   is
         correspondingly less".

17. Mr Mackenzie submitted that the new legislation  does  not  affect  the
    principle that the public interest is not cast  in  stone.   There  was
    plainly a public interest in having a well  functioning  NHS,  and  the
    letters from the clinical consultants and the hospital authorities,  in
    support of the Sponsor, clearly showed his desperate need for work in a
    specialist area, in which he had a developing expertise.

18. Second, the judge also erred in law in not taking into account  such  a
    public interest as has been stipulated in the new  Rules,  namely,  the
    fact that the Appellant in Libya spoke English and would be financially
    independent, because she worked there  anyway,  and  on  the  Sponsor's
    salary of �49,000 per annum, there was no reason why she would not be a
    person of independent financial means.  The judge below did not explain
    what, if any, weight was  given  to  these  factors.   Yet,  they  were
    material to his decision.

19. Third, although it was  the  Sponsor's  evidence  that  he  would  face
    difficulties in securing employment in war torn  Libya  currently,  the
    judge did not arrive at a judgment as to what problems  he  would  face
    with the ongoing fighting in Libya.  These matters were left unresolved
    in the determination at paragraphs 6, 9, 10, and 24.   The  judge  also
    was unable to  say  whether  the  Appellant  could  continue  with  his
    postgraduate medical training as he had claimed (see paragraphs 6,  10,
    and 25).  Yet, the judge had formed a positive  view  of  the  Sponsor,
    referring to him as a "credible witness" (at paragraph 21), which  made
    it all the more important that such proper assessments were carried out
    before a final conclusion was reached on Article 8.

20. For his part, Mr Mills submitted that what the  case  of  UE  (Nigeria)
    made clear was that for immigration  control  to  be  outweighed  as  a
    consideration in favour of other factors, the positive contribution  to
    this country had to be "very significant"  (see  paragraph  36).   This
    meant that the person affected had to be "an essential worker" such  as
    "a social worker upon whom a local community depended or  a  scientific
    research worker engaged on research of  public  importance"  (paragraph
    21).  Again that the Sponsor was  neither  in  this  case,  the  public
    interest was reduced in a material way in this case.

21. In reply, Mr Mackenzie  handed  up  the  House  of  Lords  decision  in
    Bakhtaur Singh [1986] 1 WLR, at page 910-920.  In this case,  submitted
    Mr Mackenzie, the House of Lords had made it clear that there  was  the
    effect "of third parties other than his family and  persons  intimately
    connected with him" which may well be a factor (see page  917C).   When
    one looked at the effect  on  others,  separately  from  the  Appellant
    herself, one could see "the third party interest  ...  extending  to  a
    progressively widening circle and ultimately to the public as a  whole"
    (see page 917f).

22. It was important, therefore, not to have treated the public interest as
    a immutable factor as the judge  did.   If  UE  (Nigeria)  referred  to
    social workers and those engaged in important scientific research, this
    was no less different from the position of the Sponsor, a specialist in
    trauma and orthopaedics, where there were  only  about  25  consultants
    currently engaged, and where his need was such that locums  had  to  be
    hired at three times the cost, whenever he could not come to  work  for
    reasons of sickness.  These were positive factors that  ought  to  have
    been properly taken into consideration.   He  asked  me  to  allow  the
    appeal.

Error of Law

23. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside the decision and remake the decision
    (see Section 12(2) of TCEA 2007).  My reasons are as follows.

24. First, for reasons that have been given eloquently by Mr Mackenzie  the
    judge below,  in  what  was  otherwise  a  comprehensive  and  detailed
    analysis of the facts, ended the determination  by  simply  taking  the
    public interest in Section 117(B) as an immutable factor and dismissing
    the appeal of the Appellant on that basis.  This was an error.

25. Second, the judge erred in concluding that, while she had regard to the
    evidence of the Sponsor fulfilling a valuable role within the NHS, "and
    that the NHS might face an additional cost  if  it  were  necessary  to
    replace him, those factors do not reduce the public interest identified
    in sub-Section 117B(1)", and this too was an error.  On  the  basis  of
    the established authorities on how  the  "public  interest"  is  to  be
    assessed, it is clear that they do reduce, in an appropriate case,  the
    weight to be given to those factors.

26. Third, the judge erred in his conclusion that  "the  difficulties  that
    the Sponsor may face if he returns to Libya in order to live  with  the
    Appellant do not outweigh the public  interest"  (paragraph  29).   The
    rights to livelihood is an important right,  and  one  which  has  been
    meaningfully engaged under Article 8 in the specific  circumstances  of
    this case.  The more that the Sponsor can contribute to the society  in
    the UK, the more he stands to lose, by returning to a place where he is
    not even sure whether he  can  find  employment.   The  judge  made  no
    findings on this question and yet found the Sponsor to  be  "credible".
    For all these reasons, the determination fell into error.

Remaking the Decision

27. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am allowing this appeal for the reasons set out above.

28. This is a case where the judge had  regard  to  the  Sponsor's  written
    evidence in his witness statements (see paragraph  24)  which  made  it
    clear, that the Sponsor having only recently married the Appellant,  if
    he were unable to have her in this country living with  him,  a  matter
    which he thought would not present him with any problem whatsoever (see
    paragraph 23),  he  would  then  leave  this  country  and  pursue  his
    postgraduate training somewhere else (paragraph 25).

29. This was also a  matter  where  the  judge  heard  the  Sponsor's  oral
    evidence, and found him to be credible, when he  expressed  himself  in
    these matters.  Furthermore, this was a case where there  was  evidence
    from the clinical director and general manager  of  the  Sponsor's  NHS
    Foundation Trust.  The evidence pointed out that locum agencies have to
    be used at a salary nearly three times that of the substantive post  in
    order to fulfil this very important job requirement.

30. Significantly, the consultant makes it clear that the Sponsor would  be
    employed for the foreseeable future (paragraph 26).

31. I accept that the Sponsor has been in the UK  on  discretionary  leave.
    However, people on discretionary leave cannot be expected to leave  the
    UK.  Like refugees, they have leave to remain here, and this  leave  is
    granted by the State to them, for the duration of the period for  which
    that leave is extant.  This is the distinction between having leave and
    having no leave.

32. At the same time, in what is a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship,
    that there is an  Appellant  who  speaks  English  and  is  independent
    financially, and would not be a charge on public funds were she to come
    to the UK to join the Sponsor.

33. All-in-all, I find that the balance of considerations are substantially
    in favour of the Appellant.  This appeal must be allowed.  The decision
    of the Secretary of  State  interferes  with  the  parties'  Article  8
    rights, and it is not necessary in the public interest to require there
    to be an imposed separation between the  parties,  because  the  public
    interest is firmly in favour, for  the  reasons  already  set  out,  in
    allowing the parties to live together in the UK.

34. Still less, for all these reasons, is the decision of the Secretary  of
    State one which is proportionate in all the circumstances of the case.

Decision

35. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    allowed.

No anonymity order is made.
