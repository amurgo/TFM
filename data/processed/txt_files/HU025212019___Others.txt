                            DECISION AND REASONS

BACKGROUND

1. The Appellants appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
   Housego promulgated on 7 October 2019 ("the Decision"). By the Decision,
   the Judge dismissed the Appellants' appeals against the Respondent's
   decisions dated 23 January 2019 refusing their human rights claims made
   in the context of applications to join their husband/father, Mr Najeeb
   [A] ("the Sponsor").  The Sponsor has been granted leave to remain in the
   UK following a successful appeal against a refusal to grant him asylum.
   The applications made by the Appellants are therefore ones for family
   reunion within the Immigration Rules ("the Rules") as the Sponsor's
   family members.

2. The Appellants are a mother and her two sons, currently aged twenty-four
   years and seventeen years (eighteen years in January 2021) respectively.
   They are all nationals of Pakistan as is the Sponsor.

3. The Sponsor came to the UK in 2005 with a highly skilled migrant visa.
   He sought indefinite leave to remain in that category in 2010 which was
   refused and his appeal against that refusal was unsuccessful.  He
   overstayed after 8 February 2011.  An application to remain on human
   rights grounds (Article 8) was refused and certified on 7 May 2011.  He
   claimed asylum on 27 May 2014 and was granted leave to remain on that
   basis, following a successful appeal, on 25 June 2014.

4. The Appellants came to the UK in December 2005 as the Sponsor's
   dependents.  They remained for one year but then returned to Pakistan for
   personal reasons.  They visited the Sponsor in 2010 for three months
   shortly before his application to remain was refused but again returned
   to Pakistan.  They have since remained living apart from the Sponsor.

5. The Sponsor entered into a relationship with a British citizen in 2012.
   It is his evidence that his wife, the First Appellant, has forgiven the
   transgression and that the Appellants wish to come to the UK now to join
   him as they are in a genuine and subsisting relationship.  The Sponsor
   says that his relationship with his wife and children is continued via
   the telephone.  He uses a landline for that purpose.  The Sponsor also
   relies in this regard on the funding which he provides to his family in
   Pakistan.  It was accepted that the Sponsor does send money to Pakistan.



THE DECISION

6. The Judge heard oral evidence from the Sponsor and the First Appellant's
   brother who also lives in the UK ("the Witness").  There was no evidence
   from the Appellants.


7. The Respondent disputed that the Sponsor was in a genuine and subsisting
   relationship with the Appellants.  This was the main issue which the
   Judge had to resolve although the Sponsor also asserted that the
   Appellants were at risk in Pakistan due to his preaching at Speakers
   Corner in the UK which he said had led to threats against him which he
   had reported to the police.  This appears to have been the underlying
   basis for his asylum claim.

8. The Judge accepted that the Appellants were the wife and sons of the
   Sponsor.  He accepted that the marriage was a legal one and that the
   Sponsor was the biological father of the Second and Third Appellants.
   However, he did not accept that the Sponsor remained in regular contact
   which he claimed ([40] of the Decision).  Although he accepted that the
   Sponsor sent money to Pakistan (about �700 per month), and although he
   accepted that this was "consistent with a relationship", he did not
   accept that it "was sufficient on its own".  He concluded that this was
   in the form of maintenance for the children, in the same way as many
   estranged parents no longer in a subsisting relationship would provide
   ([44] of the Decision).  Although the Judge accepted that the Sponsor and
   his wife could have put behind them the extramarital affair, he did not
   accept that this was shown to be the case on the evidence ([43] of the
   Decision).

9. The Judge also noted inconsistencies between the evidence of the Sponsor
   and the Witness which the Judge found to undermine the Sponsor's
   evidence.  The Judge noted that the Witness was apparently unaware that
   the Sponsor claims to be bisexual.  Although the Judge accepted that the
   Sponsor wanted the Appellants to come to the UK, he concluded that
   "[t]here is not the evidence before [him] to show that, on the balance of
   probabilities, they want to come to the UK to join him".

PERMISSION TO APPEAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND


10. The Appellants' grounds of appeal are lengthy, unstructured and
   discursive.  I will therefore deal with those when I turn to consider the
   way in which the appeal was presented orally.

11. Permission to appeal was refused by Designated First-tier Tribunal
   Judge McClure on 24 January 2020 in the following terms:

         ".. In a decision promulgated on 7th October 2019 Judge Housego
         dismissed the appellants' appeals against the decisions of the
         respondent to refuse the appellants' entry clearance to the UK as
         the spouse and children of a person in the UK with refugee status.
         The appellants were seeking to rely upon paragraphs 352A and 352D
         of the Immigration Rules and article 8 family life.
         The lengthy grounds of appeal challenge the approach of the judge
         to the facts of the case.  It is suggested that the judge has
         misunderstood the evidence with regard to the use of the telephone
         and shown bias by referring to the sponsor's bisexuality and his
         affair otherwise with a woman post his wife leaving him.  It is
         claimed that the judge has drawn the wrong conclusions from the
         evidence and failed to follow the guidance in the case of Goudey.
         The grounds of appeal are in the main a disagreement with the
         findings of fact made by the judge.  The allegation of bias is not
         made out.  The judge has given valid reasons for finding that there
         was not a subsisting marriage and that the best interests of the
         minor were to remain in the status quo.
         Re Ahmed [N] he is and was at the time of the application an adult,
         now aged 23, and therefore does not meet the requirements of 352D.
         He had not lived with the sponsor for over 8 years.
         Re Sammar [M] she had lived with the sponsor in the UK but was
         refused leave to remain in 2010 and voluntarily returned to
         Pakistan.  As referred to the refusal letter noted that the sponsor
         in his screening interview in 2014 sated that the first appellant
         had left him at least three years before because of his religious
         beliefs and taken the children with her to Pakistan.  The appellant
         had chosen to separate from the sponsor and has lived for at least
         9 years away from the sponsor in Pakistan.  The sponsor has had a
         relationship with a woman in that time.  Whilst taking account of
         the limited evidence of contact in the intervening period,
         telephone and maintenance, in the circumstances the judge was
         entitled to find that there was no subsisting marital relationship
         with the first appellant.
         Re Ali [N] he had been living in Pakistan with his mother and
         brother, as a separate family unit for over 8 years.  Again the
         judge was entitled to find that the appellant's best interest were
         to remain with his family in Pakistan.
         The judge has properly considered all of the evidence presented and
         given valid reasons for the decision reached.  There is no arguable
         material error of law.  The application is refused."


12. On renewal of the application to this Tribunal, permission was granted
   by Upper Tribunal Judge Kamara on 16 March 2020 in the following terms so
   far as relevant:

         "..2.    It is at least arguable that the First-tier Tribunal
         misdirected itself by failing to apply the approach to assessing
         evidence of a subsisting marriage set out in Goudey (subsisting
         marriage - evidence) Sudan [2012] UKUT 00041 (IAC).  All grounds
         may be argued."


13. By a Note and Directions dated 8 April 2020, UTJ Bruce indicated her
   provisional view that the error of law issue could be determined on the
   papers pursuant to Rule 34 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
   Rules 2008.   The parties were invited to make submissions on that
   course.


14. The Respondent filed written submissions on 11 May 2020 seeking to
   uphold the Decision.  The Appellants filed a "Reply" dated 18 May 2020
   addressing the Respondent's submissions and clarifying their position.
   In essence, the Appellants submitted that permission to appeal was sought
   on a single ground "namely that it was arguable that the FTTJ misdirected
   himself in law when determining whether the First Appellant had adduced
   sufficient evidence to prove that her and the Sponsor's relationship was
   subsisting; specifically, that the FTTJ failed to properly apply the
   approach to assessing evidence of subsisting marriage advised by the
   Upper Tribunal in Goudey (subsisting marriage - evidence) Sudan [2012]
   UKUT 00041 IAC" ("Goudey").


15. Directions were subsequently given by UTJ C Lane on 6 July 2020 that
   the error of law issue should be determined at a remote hearing.  He also
   gave directions for the filing of skeleton arguments and any Rule 15(2A)
   notice with further evidence.  The Appellant filed a skeleton argument
   dated 27 July 2020.  The Respondent continues to rely on her earlier
   submissions.  There has been no application to adduce any further
   evidence.


16. In addition to the various submissions to which I have had regard, I
   also had before me the bundle of documents which were before the First-
   tier Tribunal to which I refer as necessary as [AB/xx].


17. The hearing before me was conducted via Skype for Business. Other than
   a minor difficulty with me joining the hearing at the outset, there were
   no technical difficulties and both parties confirmed that they were able
   to follow the proceedings throughout.

18. The matter comes before me to determine whether the Decision contains
   an error of law and, if I so conclude, to either re-make the decision or
   remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to do so.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

19. Mr Dhanji's oral submissions may be categorised as a complaint, first
   that the Judge failed to adopt the correct legal approach in a case such
   as this following the Tribunal's guidance in Goudey and, second, that the
   Judge had in any event either failed to give adequate reasons for his
   finding that there was not a subsisting relationship or that the Judge's
   finding in that regard was not open to him on the evidence for reasons
   which I expand on below.


20. Ms Everett in response pointed out that the Respondent had taken issue
   with whether there was a genuine and subsisting relationship between the
   Sponsor and, in particular, the First Appellant.  She submitted that, in
   light of that starting point, the Judge did not have to undertake the
   exercise set out in Goudey all over again.  It was sufficient for the
   Judge to go directly to what were considered to be the factors militating
   against a finding of a genuine and subsisting relationship and to
   consider whether, notwithstanding the finding that there is still a legal
   marriage, the relationship was nonetheless no longer subsisting.


21. The starting point for Mr Dhanji's submissions is what is said by the
   Tribunal in Goudey.  The passages relevant to my consideration are as
   follows:


       [Headnote]
       "i)                GA ("Subsisting" marriage) Ghana * [2006] UKAIT
       00046  means that the matrimonial relationship must continue at  the
       relevant time rather than just the formality of a marriage,  but  it
       does not require  the production of particular evidence  of   mutual
       devotion before entry clearance can be granted.
       ii)              Evidence of telephone cards is  capable  of  being
       corroborative of the contention of the parties that they communicate
       by telephone, even if such data cannot confirm the particular number
       the sponsor was calling in the country in  question.  It  is  not  a
       requirement that the parties also write or text each other.
       iii)            Where there are no countervailing factors generating
       suspicion as to the intentions of the parties, such evidence may  be
       sufficient to discharge the burden of proof on the claimant."


       "10.   In our judgement the judge has mis-directed himself as to the
       weight to be attached to the total  documentation  relating  to  the
       telephone calls. Whilst it is true that this documentation does  not
       of itself prove that the sponsor has been speaking to  his  wife  as
       opposed  to  someone  else  in  the  Sudan,   the   material   gives
       corroborative support for the wife's account in the entry  clearance
       application and the appellant's testimony in the appeal. It is clear
       that a great many telephone calls have been made using the telephone
       cards during the period of the  relationship.  This  is  substantial
       support for the proposition that they conducted  their  relationship
       by telephone. It is improbable that all this communication was  with
       someone else rather than the person who the sponsor has married  and
       wants to bring to the United Kingdom. Parties who intend to  conduct
       a relationship by telephone do not also  have  to  demonstrate  that
       they conduct a relationship by written correspondence  in  order  to
       show that they  intend  to  live  together  as  man  and  wife.  The
       suggestion that they may have texted each other  is  speculation  on
       the judge's part. As we understand the position  it  would  be  more
       expensive to text and the telephone cards cannot be  used  for  that
       purpose. The judge was therefore imposing his own view  of  how  the
       parties could reasonably be expected to conduct  their  relationship
       as opposed to evaluating the consistent and supported evidence  that
       was before him as to how they actually did.
       11.       Everything else is neutral in this  case.   There  is  no
       evidence of lies, poor immigration history or  deception.  There  is
       some evidence of financial sponsorship though the judge was entitled
       to be unimpressed by it for  the  reason  he  gave  the  absence  of
       receipts is  not  a  factor  that  goes  to  the  discredit  of  the
       application.
       12.       Accordingly we find that there has been an error of law in
       the assessment of this case and  whether  the  requirements  of  the
       Immigration Rules had been met. It may be that the ECO and the judge
       considered that the requirement  to  show  a  "subsisting  marriage"
       imposes some significant burden to produce evidence other than  that
       showing that there was a genuine intention to live together  as  man
       and wife in a married relationship.  If so we conclude that that  is
       an error of law. The authority of GA ("Subsisting" marriage) Ghana
       * [2006] UKAIT 00046; [2006] Imm AR 543 only requires that there is
       a real relationship as  opposed  to  the  merely  formal  one  of  a
       marriage which has not been terminated. Where  there  is  a  legally
       recognised marriage and the parties who are living apart  both  want
       to be together and live together as husband and wife, we cannot  see
       that more is required to demonstrate that the marriage is subsisting
       and thus qualifies under the Immigration Rules."
       [my emphasis]


22. Before turning to the Decision, I need to say something about the facts
   of Goudey.  Although I accept that the headnote in that decision provides
   general guidance which applies to all cases, each case is of course fact
   specific.   The sponsor in Goudey was originally a Sudanese national who
   formed a relationship with another Sudanese national in 2008 when he was
   living in the UK and she in Sudan.  The sponsor was recognised as a
   refugee and subsequently acquired British nationality.  Thereafter, the
   sponsor travelled to Egypt in 2010 to meet with his wife and an
   application was made for entry clearance whilst the couple were in Egypt.
     There was evidence of telephone contact dating back to 2008 although it
   could not be confirmed that the number called was that of the appellant.
    The sponsor also provided evidence of remittances to his wife although
   there was no evidence of receipts.   The judge in that case appears to
   have thought that, where the parties had not lived together previously,
   that was reason to require more formal evidence of intention in order to
   demonstrate that they intended to do so in the future.  He found against
   the appellant on the basis that there was no confirmation in the evidence
   of the person being telephoned and therefore no evidence, such as texts,
   to show that communication was between the appellant and sponsor.  The
   judge also found an inconsistency in the evidence as to why the parties
   were not in written communication.   There was though evidence from the
   appellant in the application as to the manner of contact which was
   consistent with the evidence of the sponsor.


23. As I have already indicated, in this case, the Judge accepted that the
   marriage between the Sponsor and the First Appellant was a legal one and
   that the Sponsor is the biological father of the Second and Third
   Appellants.  Those findings appear at [39] of the Decision.  The Judge
   also accepted, as I have already noted that the Sponsor's extra-marital
   affair in 2012 (when the Sponsor cohabited with another woman) was
   "certainly capable of being a matter the couple could put behind them."
   ([43] of the Decision).  The Judge did go on however to point out that
   there was "no evidence that this has occurred other than the assertion of
   the sponsor."  The Judge accepted at [44] that the evidence as to money
   transfers was consistent as between the Sponsor and the Witness (the
   First Appellant's brother) but concluded that this was "not sufficient on
   its own, when considered as part of the evidence as a whole" ([44] of the
   Decision).

24. The Judge's finding that there was not a genuine and subsisting
   relationship therefore turns on what is said at [40] to [42] of the
   Decision as follows:


         "40. The sponsor provided no evidence of calls or contact with the
         appellants, other than a handful of calling cards.  There was no
         call history from the landline he said that he used, which begs the
         question as to why there were calling cards at all (raised in the
         hearing and not dealt with).  The brother in law used WhatsApp with
         no difficulty at either end, so the sponsor's account that he did
         not as it was problematic was not correct.  The sponsor had no
         photographs of the appellants, which they were able to send to the
         witness.  There was nothing from any of the 3 appellants in support
         of the appeals.  The sponsor did not know much about the education
         of his sons.  He was very hesitant about what O levels the younger
         had taken and what he was doing now, and about the University
         course of the older.
         41.  The sponsor had not made application, on his own account, from
         2014 to 2018.  He said he could not afford to do so, but says also
         that he was sending �700 a month to Pakistan to maintain the
         appellants.  While that may have drained him of funds, if he wanted
         to make an application doubtless he could have sent a little less
         and saved it, or asked his brother in law to help his sister.
         However he did not need a large sum as I note that the application
         (in R2) did not attract a fee, being an asylum family reunion
         application, which means that this has little credibility.
         42.  The witness knew very little about the sponsor.  He did not
         know of his bisexuality.  He did not know of the affair until
         recently, although the sponsor said that he had lived with the
         woman for 6-7 months.  He said that he did not speak much about
         personal things with his sister.  She had told him that the sponsor
         sent money and it seemed enough for her.  He was doubtless a
         truthful witness, but his evidence was not of much assistance,
         given that he knew little about the key issue in the appeals."


   I did not understand Mr Dhanji to dispute the factual basis underlying
   any of the reasons; simply whether the Judge could reasonably draw the
   conclusion he had from the evidence.


25. The other relevant passage is, therefore, the conclusion drawn by the
   Judge at [45] of the Decision, based on his findings as follows:


         "45. The sponsor doubtless wants the appellants to come to the UK.
         There is not the evidence before me to show that, on the balance of
         probabilities, they want to come to the UK to join him.
         46.  The 2nd appellant is at University, and has a home with his
         mother and brother.  He has evinced no wish to come to the UK and
         disturb his University education.
         47.  The 3rd appellant is cared for by his mother, is being
         educated and is maintained by the sponsor.  The duty under S55
         Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 is not breached by
         the decision under appeal.
         48.  The 2nd and 3rd appellants are not much in contact with the
         sponsor and their family life is not adversely affected by the
         decisions under appeal.  This is a continuance of the status quo
         that was chosen by the sponsor at least from 2014-2018.
         49.  The appellants have lived in Pakistan since 2010, without
         threat or attack.  There were hostile text messages sent to the
         sponsor in the UK, but no consequence (or likelihood of
         consequence) for the appellants in Pakistan".


   I point out, in that regard, that, unlike Goudey, the appeal in this case
   was and could only be on human rights grounds.  That said, the factual
   finding as to the subsistence of the relationship and therefore the
   ability to meet the Rules is clearly central to the Article 8 issue.


26. As Ms Everett pointed out, the appeals are against the Respondent's
   decisions and it is therefore appropriate also to set out the
   Respondent's reasoning. The Respondent's reasons for refusing the
   applications (of the First Appellant with the Second and Third Appellants
   as her dependents) are as follows:


         "The information provided by yourself and your sponsor has been
         considered to determine if the requirements of the Immigration
         Rules have been met.  In reaching this decision, which has been
         made on the balance of probabilities, the following points have
         been noted:
          - You have applied for Family Reunion in order to join your spouse
            Najeeb [A] in the UK.  I note that you have previously been
            issued entry clearance as the dependent of your spouse.  Home
            Office records show that you were refused leave to remain in
            September 2010 and that you subsequently voluntarily departed
            the UK.
          - It is noted that on May 15th 2014, during a screening interview
            your spouse stated that he had not seen you for 'three years'
            and had been in a relationship with a British citizen for 6-7
            months, and that she had subsequently left him.  Your sponsor
            has further stated in his Witness Statement (undated) and
            statement of oath (page 12) that he has experienced domestic
            problems with his ex-wife (named as being yourself) after
            revealing his religious beliefs, he claims that you left him and
            took his children away from him (WS page 7).  Paragraph 352A of
            the Immigration Rules states the following:-
            'each of the parties intends to live permanently with the other
            as his or her spouse civil partner and the marriage is
            subsisting'
          - You have submitted a statement regarding marriage written by
            your sponsor dated 14 December 2018, in which he claims your
            relationship is genuine and subsisting. It is noted that in this
            statement your sponsor has stated that he informed you of his
            relationship with another woman, you accepted his apology and
            are now together again.  You have stated within your affidavit
            that you continuously kept in touch with your husband after you
            left the UK, however no mention has been made by yourself of his
            previous relationship with another woman which took place when
            you were still married.
          - The evidence you have submitted in support of your claim that
            your marriage is genuine and subsisting consists of money
            transfer invoices; however, as you claim to have 2 children
            together it cannot be assessed that these funds were intended
            for you and were not to support your sponsors children.
          - Additionally, Home Office records show that you left the UK in
            2010 along with your two sons due to the death of your father.
            However, it is unclear why you waited 5 years after leaving to
            re-join your spouse and make an initial application for family
            reunion, which was later refused.  Additionally, given that your
            sponsor has had at least one other relationship since your
            departure which has not been acknowledged by yourself, I am not
            satisfied that your marriage remains subsisting.  Therefore, I
            am not satisfied that you meet the requirements of paragraph
            352A(v)."


27. Although there is mention in the refusal of an affidavit provided from
   the First Appellant, that does not appear to be in the bundles before me
   and nor can I see any reference to it in the lengthy list of documents
   said to have been before the Entry Clearance Officer.  The extent of the
   evidence which was before the Judge, from the Appellants themselves is
   confined to what is said in the First Appellant's application under
   "Additional Information" as follows:


         "Please note that my husband Najeeb [A] went to England on 6th of
         August 2005 on HSMP visa and we joined him in December 2005.  We
         stayed with him one year as his dependent and a further application
         was made for the extension of HSMP visa which was granted until
         2010.  However due to personel [sic] circumstances we had to move
         back to Pakistan.  further before our HMPS visa was due to expire
         in June 2010 me and my two children visited the sponsor for three
         months and then we went back."


   A similar wording (adapted to the circumstances) appears in each of the
   Second and Third Appellants' application forms.  Even that may not be
   evidence from the Appellants themselves as the forms were not completed
   by the Appellants themselves, were submitted electronically and appear to
   have been lodged from a Post Office in Wembley. The forms were completed
   by E K Mahmood who, it appears from the appeal forms, is a legal
   representative working for Nationwide Law Associates in the UK and
   therefore presumably instructed by the Sponsor.  I do not draw any
   adverse inference from that position (and more importantly neither did
   the First-tier Tribunal Judge) but it does underpin the finding by the
   Judge as to lack of evidence of intention from the First Appellant in
   particular.  The First Appellant would have been well aware that the
   Respondent took issue with the genuineness of the relationship between
   her and the Sponsor and no explanation is given for the lack of evidence
   from her.


28. I begin by noting that the skeleton argument submitted by the
   Appellants for the First-tier Tribunal hearing at [AB/15-20] makes no
   mention of Goudey.  Of course, that is not and could not be determinative
   of whether the Judge should have had regard to the guidance.  It may
   though be a reason why the Judge did not consider it necessary to refer
   to the case.  The skeleton argument is structured in much the same way as
   Ms Everett submitted that the Judge had approached the issues; that is to
   say from the starting point of the Respondent's reasons for refusing the
   applications.


29. Whether or not that was the right approach, I do not accept Mr Dhanji's
   submission that the Judge's approach is in any way at odds with the
   guidance in Goudey.   Read as a whole, the headnote in that case merely
   indicates that, where there is a legal marriage, there is no need to
   require other evidence as to the subsistence of the relationship, unless
   there are countervailing factors which give rise to a suspicion that
   there might not be.  In Goudey, the only question mark about the
   relationship appears to have been that the relationship between the
   sponsor and the appellant had been formed whilst they were living in
   different countries and that they had lived apart for two years prior to
   the making of the application for entry clearance, such that there might
   be a concern about their future intentions.  This case is factually very
   different.


30. As such, the Judge was right to begin by noting that the marriage was a
   legal one.  The issue thereafter though was whether there were
   "countervailing factors" which indicated that the relationship was
   nonetheless not genuine and subsisting.  Although the Judge did not
   expressly refer to his reasons in terms of "countervailing factors", read
   as a whole, his reasoning thereafter at [39] to [44] of the Decision
   follows that approach.   The Judge therefore undertook the correct
   exercise and there is no erroneous failure properly to direct himself or
   any wrong self-direction.


31. I turn then to the second way in which Mr Dhanji argued the case,
   namely that the Judge has provided insufficient reasons for his finding
   that the relationship is not genuine and subsisting or that the
   conclusion he reached was not open to him on the evidence.


32. Based on what is said at [39] to [44] of the Decision, the reasons can
   be summarised as follows:
   a) There was an inconsistency in the way in which the Sponsor claimed to
      remain in contact with the Appellants.  If, as he said, he used a
      landline, the calling cards which appear at the end of the Appellant's
      bundle can have no evidential value.  The Sponsor said that he did not
      use WhatsApp in order to communicate due to connection problems
      ([27.1] of the Decision) but that was inconsistent with the evidence
      of the Witness who used that method of communication.
   b) The Sponsor had produced no photographs of the Appellants in the nine
      years that they had lived separately.   He said that he had some which
      could be produced ([27.2] of the Decision).  However, none were
      provided and there has been no application to adduce further evidence.


   c) The Appellants provided no evidence for the appeals. Even if the
      application forms were completed on the Appellants' instructions and
      there was, as the Respondent says, an affidavit asserting the
      continuance of the relationship, there was no statement from any of
      the Appellants before the Judge. As such, there was no confirmation
      from the First Appellant that she and the Sponsor had put the extra
      marital affair behind them or as to her attitude to his bisexuality.
      The Witness was not aware of the Sponsor's bisexuality and had only
      recently been made aware of the affair ([40], [42] and [43] of the
      Decision).
   d) The Sponsor was hesitant in his evidence as to the detail of his sons'
      education.
   e) There was no application for the Sponsor's family to join him between
      2014 (when his asylum appeal was allowed) and 2018.  The Sponsor's
      explanation was that he did not have the money to pay for the
      application, but these were family reunion applications which do not
      attract a fee ([41] of the Decision).


33. I did not understand Mr Dhanji to take issue with any of the facts on
   which

                                                                     the
   Judge's reasons are based; rather he submitted that it was not open to
   the Judge to reach the conclusion he did on that evidence.  That is
   essentially a submission that the Judge's conclusion is irrational or
   perverse on the evidence.  That is a high threshold to cross and one
   which is not made out in this case.


34. Nor can it be said that the Judge has failed adequately to provide
   reasons for his conclusions.  Those are evident from the summary which I
   have provided above of the relevant part of the Decision.


35. For those reasons, the Judge was entitled to reach the conclusion he
   did about the subsistence of the relationships between the Appellants and
   the Sponsor.  It follows that the Appellants have failed to show that the
   Decision contains any error of law. I therefore uphold the Decision

DECISION

The Decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Housego promulgated on 7 October
2019 does not involve the making of an error on a point of law. I therefore
uphold the Decision with the consequence that the Appellants' appeals
remain dismissed.
