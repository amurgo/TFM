                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                                DETERMINATION



   1. On 19 August 2013 I considered an application for permission to appeal
      to the Upper Tribunal. I found that the Judge in  the  First-tier  had
      made no arguable error  of  law  in  his  determination  when  he  had
      considered the merits of  the  appellant's  claims  but  that  it  was
      arguable that he should have allowed the appeal against  the  decision
      of the respondent to issue removal directions under section 47 of  the
      Immigration, Nationality and Asylum Act 2006.


   2. I directed that unless I received submissions to the  contrary  within
      14 days I would substitute for the decision of  the  judge  dismissing
      the appeal a decision to dismiss the immigration appeal and a decision
      to allow the appeal against the decision to remove under  Section  47.
      The respondent has replied stating that my decision is not challenged.
      There has been no reply from the appellants. I therefore  now make the
      following  decision:


 Decision

This appeal under Tier 4 of  the  Rules  and  on  human  rights  grounds  is
       dismissed.
The appeal against the decision to remove under Section 47 is allowed.





Signed                                  Date: 17 September 2013
