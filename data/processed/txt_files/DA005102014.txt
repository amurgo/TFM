                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

This is an appeal by the Secretary of State for the Home Department  against
the decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing Mr Cristo's appeal  against
the decision to deport him from the United Kingdom  pursuant  to  regulation
19(3)(b) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006  ("the
EEA Regulations").

For the purposes  of  this  decision,  I  shall  hereinafter  refer  to  the
Secretary of State as  the  respondent  and  Mr  Cristo  as  the  appellant,
reflecting their positions as they were in the appeal before the  First-tier
Tribunal.

The appellant is a citizen of Portugal, born on 11 August 1976.  He  arrived
in the United Kingdom on 28  April  2004  and  first  came  to  the  adverse
attention of the authorities when he was arrested for burglary  with  intent
to steal on 9 September 2009. Between 16 November 2009 and 23 December  2013
he accumulated 11 convictions  for  17  offences,  including  11  theft  and
kindred offences and six offences relating to police/courts/ prisons. On  23
December 2013 he was convicted  at  Coventry  Magistrates  Court  of  theft/
shoplifting and  commission  of  further  offences  during  the  operational
period of a suspended sentence order. He was sentenced on the  same  day  to
20 weeks imprisonment. On 14 February 2014 he was served  with  a  liability
for deportation notice and on 10 March 2014 the respondent made  a  decision
to deport him under regulation 21 of the EEA Regulations.

In the reasons for deportation letter, the respondent  considered  that  the
evidence  submitted  by  the  appellant  was  insufficient  to  confirm  his
continuous residence and employment of five years  in  accordance  with  the
EEA Regulations and  that  he  had  therefore  not  acquired  the  right  to
permanent residence. The respondent noted that the index offence  for  which
the appellant was convicted on 23 December  2013  was  for  theft  of  three
joints of gammon steak to the value of �15 belonging  to  Co-Op  stores  and
that the original offence, in respect of which a suspended  order  had  been
made on 11 February 2013, was for theft of two joints of meat  from  Iceland
Foods to the value  of  �10.  The  respondent  also  noted  the  appellant's
previous convictions for failing  to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  a
community order, failing to surrender to custody at the appointed  time  and
commission  of  a  further  offence  during  the  operational  period  of  a
suspended sentence order and noted that on the most recent occasion  he  was
convicted for failing to surrender to custody at  the  appointed  time.  The
respondent considered that the  appellant  had  shown  no  remorse  for  his
behaviour, that there was  insufficient  evidence  that  he  had  adequately
addressed all the reasons for his offending behaviour and that  no  evidence
had been provided to show that he had successfully completed  any  programme
or addressed the issue with drugs that had led him to commit  the  offences.
It was considered that  he  had  a  propensity  to  re-offend  and  that  he
represented a genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  to  the
public to justify his deportation. It was considered further  that  even  if
he had permanent residence  in  the  United  Kingdom  the  requirements  for
serious grounds of public policy would have been satisfied.  The  respondent
considered that it would not be unreasonable  to  expect  the  appellant  to
readjust to life  in  Portugal,  that  deportation  to  Portugal  would  not
prejudice his prospects of rehabilitation and that the  decision  to  deport
him was in accordance with the EEA Regulations. It  was  considered  further
that his deportation would not breach his Article 8 rights under the ECHR.

The appellant's appeal against that decision was  heard  in  the  First-tier
Tribunal on 8 August 2014 by  a  panel  consisting  of  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Colyer and Ms S E Singer. On the basis  of  the  documentary  evidence
before them, the panel accepted that by the time of the  index  offence  the
appellant had  acquired  a  right  of  permanent  residence  in  the  United
Kingdom. They therefore went on to consider the second level of  seriousness
under the EEA Regulations. Having considered the  nature  of  his  offending
and his circumstances in the United Kingdom and in Portugal, they  concluded
that his conduct did not satisfy the "serious grounds"  test  in  Regulation
21(3) and they allowed the appeal under the EEA Regulations. They also  went
on to consider Article 8 and found that his  deportation  would  breach  his
human rights in that respect and allowed the appeal on that basis as well.

The respondent sought permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  two
grounds: that the panel had misdirected itself in finding  that  there  were
no serious grounds of public policy  in  deporting  the  appellant  and  had
failed  properly  to  take  into  account  the  public  interest  in   their
proportionality assessment; and that the panel  had  materially  misdirected
themselves in their consideration of the appellant's Article  8  rights  and
in allowing the appeal under Article  8  and  had  failed  to  consider  the
principles in Nasim and others (Article 8) Pakistan [2014] UKUT 25

Permission to appeal was granted on 2 September 2014.

Appeal hearing and submissions

Ms Johnson confirmed that there was no  challenge  to  the  panel's  finding
that the appellant had acquired  a  right  of  permanent  residence  in  the
United Kingdom and that the second level of  "seriousness"  was  accordingly
accepted as the relevant test under regulation 21 of  the  EEA  Regulations.
She relied upon the grounds of appeal  and  submitted  that  the  panel  had
erred by failing to consider that the appellant's persistent offending  over
a number of years made the offending serious. The panel failed  to  consider
the public interest in line with the judgement in SS (Nigeria)  v  Secretary
of State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 550.  The  public  interest
was high in cases of persistent  offenders.  The  appellant  had  failed  to
rehabilitate himself. Whilst the panel concluded that he had done  so,  they
only  considered  the  period  whilst  he  was  detained  and   subject   to
deportation proceedings and simply accepted  his  explanation,  but  had  no
probation or expert reports to assist them and had  no  supporting  evidence
such as from drugs counselling. With regard to Article 8, the appellant  did
not  meet  the  high  threshold   to   show   that   his   deportation   was
disproportionate. The panel relied on the threat of deportation as a  reason
for accepting that the appellant would not re-offend but  had  nothing  from
experts to confirm that.

The appellant did not wish to make any response, but produced a letter  from
The Old Vicarage in relation to accommodation  and  voluntary  work,  to  be
considered in the event that the panel's decision was set aside.

Consideration and findings.

The basis upon which permission was  granted  in  relation  to  the  panel's
decision under the EEA Regulations was their arguable failure to  take  into
account the fact of multiple offences,  the  failure  by  the  appellant  to
rehabilitate himself and  his  propensity  to  re-offend,  when  considering
whether  there  were  serious  grounds  of  public  policy  justifying   his
deportation. Ms Johnson's submission was  that  the  appellant's  persistent
offending over a number of years and lack of  genuine  rehabilitation  meant
that his offending was serious and accordingly that the public  interest  in
his deportation was high.

However  it  seems  to  me  that  these  were  matters  fully  and  properly
considered by the panel and that the  grounds  of  appeal  are,  in  effect,
little more than a disagreement with their findings and conclusions.

The panel were perfectly aware of the  appellant's  multiple  offending  and
thus referred to him as a "serial shoplifter" and  to  his  "numerous  petty
thieving". They were aware of the fact that he had  re-offended  during  the
operational period of previously suspended sentences and they looked at  the
nature  of  his  offending  in  some  detail  at  paragraph  29   of   their
determination,  describing  it  at  paragraph  30   as   "persistent   petty
offending". They went on at paragraphs 31 and 32 to  consider  whether  that
offending could be considered as "other serious criminal activity", such  as
to fall within the UKBA's internal  guidance  in  cases  of  deportation  of
foreign  national  offenders  from  the  EEA,  taking   into   account   the
appellant's drug addiction throughout his offending.  At  paragraph  32  the
panel concluded that the appellant's offending  should  not  be  classed  as
"serious criminal activity".

Having considered the nature of the appellant's  past  offending,  including
the index offence, the panel then went on to consider  the  risk  of  future
offending, looking at relevant factors such as his behaviour in prison,  his
qualifications and employment prospects and  his  attempts  to  address  his
drug addiction. They did  not  have  the  benefit  of  any  pre-sentence  or
probation report and accordingly were able only  to  look  at  the  evidence
before them, which included, as  is  apparent  from  paragraph  34,  several
certificates of achievements obtained by the appellant whilst in prison.  It
is not clear what evidence was before the panel in regard  to  his  attempts
to address his drug problem and that was a matter that I  therefore  put  to
Ms Johnson and  to  the  appellant.  The  appellant  informed  me  that  the
certificates related mostly to his education in  prison,  but  that  he  had
produced to the panel a signed letter relating to the question of drugs.  Ms
Johnson was unable to advise on the nature of the certificates and  evidence
produced before the panel  but  she  submitted  that  paragraph  34  of  the
determination suggested that they merely relied  upon  the  appellant's  own
oral evidence.

What is clear, however, from paragraphs 34 to 38, is  that  the  panel  gave
careful consideration to the matter of the appellant's  drugs  problem,  the
impact that that had on his past offending and the impact that  his  efforts
to address the problem had on his future risk of re-offending. It was  their
conclusion that, whilst the respondent's decision was based  on  an  absence
of any evidence of efforts made by the appellant  to  address  his  problems
and thus reduce the risk he posed of re-offending,  they  were  able  to  be
satisfied on the evidence before them, that  those  issues  had  since  been
resolved. They were entirely satisfied that the  appellant  had  been  drug-
free since 23 December 2013, that he had successfully  attended  a  relevant
course in prison and that he was intent on remaining  drug-free.  They  were
satisfied  that,  having  successfully  addressed  his  drug  problem,   the
appellant was not likely to re-offend and would not pose a risk or a  threat
to the public. The respondent's submission is, in effect, that that was  not
a conclusion that was  open  to  the  panel  to  reach,  given  the  limited
evidence before them. However it seems to me that the  panel,  having  heard
from the appellant and considered the  evidence  available,  were  perfectly
entitled to reach such a conclusion.

It  was  also  Ms  Johnson's  submission   that   there   was   no   genuine
rehabilitation on the appellant's part, given that  any  effort  to  address
his offending behaviour had been undertaken only whilst there was  a  threat
of deportation and whilst he  was  in  prison.  It  is  the  case  that  the
appellant's drugs-free status had existed only since he  had  been  detained
and that the panel's  findings,  in  particular  at  paragraph  35  and  39,
reflected the influence upon the appellant of  the  Home  Office's  actions.
However it seems to me that the panel were entitled, on  the  basis  of  the
evidence before them and having heard from the appellant, to find  that  the
continuing threat of deportation and the prospect of return to  imprisonment
or detention was sufficient to motivate him to desist from further  criminal
activity. Indeed it must surely be that a certain degree of  speculation  is
required in all such cases and that that is justifiable providing that  that
speculation is rooted in the available evidence and is cogently reasoned.

For all of these reasons I consider that the panel reached a  decision  that
was open to them on the evidence before them, having taken into account  all
material factors and properly addressed  the  relevant  test  in  accordance
with regulation 21 of the EEA  Regulations.  The  panel  plainly  took  full
account of the public interest and gave careful consideration to  the  level
of risk or threat the appellant posed to the community. They  were  entitled
to conclude that the higher threshold of seriousness had  not  been  reached
to justify the appellant's deportation under the EEA Regulations.

I accept that there may well have been some arguable merit  in  the  grounds
of appeal relating to the panel's decision on Article 8, had  that  decision
stood in isolation. However, it seems to me that the fact  that  the  appeal
was allowed under the EEA Regulations and that I uphold that decision  means
that nothing material arises from this ground of appeal.

 Accordingly I find that the panel did not make any errors of law  requiring
their decision to be set aside, but that they were  entitled  to  reach  the
decision that they did.

DECISION

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve  an
error on a point of law. I do not set aside the decision. The  Secretary  of
State's appeal is dismissed and the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to
allow Mr Cristo's appeal stands.
