For the Appellant:     Ms Bustani of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms Fijiwala, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant a citizen of the Philippines  (born  2nd  December  1975)
    appeals with permission against the decision of a  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge R G Walters) dismissing his appeal against the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's decision of 1st December 2015 refusing him entry to the UK as
    the fianc� of Miss Paula Denny ("the Sponsor").



Background

 2. The Appellant applied for entry clearance to the UK on the basis of his
    relationship with the Sponsor.  The Appellant and the Sponsor first met
    in 2011 when both were working in Singapore.  They subsequently  formed
    a relationship and both now wish to marry and live with one another  as
    husband and wife. The  Appellant  therefore  applied  for  entry  as  a
    fianc�.

 3. The Entry Clearance Officer considered the application but noted;

      i) The Appellant is not free to marry.  He is presently married to  Ms
         Joanna Carlos who is also a citizen of the Philippines.  There  are
         four children to the marriage.

     ii) The Appellant had submitted a letter  from  his  solicitors  saying
         that he separated from Ms Carlos in 2009 and that he would obtain a
         divorce in the UK.

    iii) The Entry Clearance Officer further noted that although there is no
         divorce  in  the  Philippines,   annulment   proceedings   may   be
         instituted.   The  annulment  of  the  marriage  would  leave   the
         Appellant free to marry.

 4. The Entry Clearance Officer in the refusal letter also said,

         "Furthermore, whilst the annulment  process  was  indeed  a  timely
         process historically, this has now become more  simplified  and  we
         are experiencing annulments being processed between 6-12 months."

    I pause here to say that following the service of an  expert's  report,
    Ms Fijiwala conceded that 6-12 months is an  incorrect  estimation  and
    accepted that the norm for obtaining an annulment could  take  anywhere
    from 2 to 6 years.

 5. The Appellant appealed the ECO's refusal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    The findings made by the FtTJ accepted that  the  Appellant  could  not
    fulfil the requirements of the Immigration  Rules  on  the  basis  that
    entry as a fianc� requires that an Appellant is  able  to  arrange  his
    marriage within the six month period of the visa.  The FtTJ found  that
    it was more likely than not that the Appellant would be  unable  to  be
    free to marry within the six month period permitted by the  Immigration
    Rules.

 6. The FtTJ then looked at Article  8  and  decided  that  Article  8  was
    engaged in the sense that the Appellant and Sponsor are committed to  a
    long term relationship and do intend to marry eventually. That  finding
    stands. It has not been challenged.  The  FtTJ  concluded  nevertheless
    there would be no interference with any Article 8 rights  saying  in  a
    few short lines at [18]:

         "I find that the interference is proportionate  to  the  legitimate
         public end sought to be achieved because the Appellant has not  yet
         even started the annulment proceedings in the Philippines; nor have
         the parties investigated the prospects of the Appellant  having  an
         'offshore' divorce from his wife."

    He dismissed the appeal.

 7. The  Appellant  sought  permission  to  appeal.   The  grounds  seeking
    permission essentially relied upon Article 8 but also claimed that  the
    decision was in breach of Article 12 (right to marriage).

 8. Permission to appeal was initially refused in the FtT but  was  granted
    upon a renewed application to the UT.  The grant of permission which is
    succinct in terms reads as follows:

         "The appellant challenges the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
         Walters dismissing his appeal  for  entry  clearance  to  join  his
         fianc�e on human  rights  grounds.   His  application  was  refused
         because although he met all the other requirements of the rules, he
         was not free to marry.

         Arguably, having accepted that Article 8 was engaged,  the  judge's
         very brief  proportionality  assessment  arguably  failed  to  take
         account of the personal circumstances  of  the  appellant  and  his
         fianc�e or the expert evidence  on  the  question  of  obtaining  a
         divorce in the Philippines.  All the grounds may be argued."

    Thus the matter comes before me to decide if the decision  of  the  FtT
    contains such error that the decision must be set aside to be remade.



UT Hearing

 9. Before me Ms Bustani appeared for the Appellant and Ms Fijiwala for the
    Entry Clearance Officer.  At the outset of  the  hearing,  Ms  Fijiwala
    conceded that she accepted that Judge Walters'  decision  contained  an
    error of law requiring the decision to be set aside.  She accepted that
    the judge, having found that family life existed between the  Appellant
    and the Sponsor, had failed to engage in a meaningful assessment on the
    proportionality or otherwise of the decision.

10. Ms Fijiwala said further that if I agreed with  that  concession,  then
    the matter could proceed by the decision being  made  in  the  UT;  the
    Sponsor was available to give evidence and she had only a few questions
    to ask of her.  Ms Bustani was agreeable to this course.

11. I indicated that I was satisfied that the  decision  of  Judge  Walters
    must be set  aside  for  legal  error  in  that  there  was  no  proper
    assessment or findings made which showed that  the  FtTJ  had  properly
    considered the proportionality exercise  as  per  the  fifth  stage  of
    Razgar.  I was satisfied that I was in a position to hear evidence  and
    thereby remake the decision.





Remaking the decision

12. I heard evidence from the Sponsor, [PD].  She relied upon  two  written
    statements (one of which was handwritten) dated  7th  April  2017.   In
    addition she referred to a statement from the Appellant dated 2nd April
    2017.

13. The evidence set out in the Sponsor's statement confirmed that she  and
    the Appellant met in 2011.  They were both working in Singapore.   They
    started  a  relationship  but  did  not  cohabit  at  that  time.   The
    relationship endured but subsequently the  Appellant  returned  to  the
    Philippines via Malaysia and Macau where he was working.   The  Sponsor
    returned to the UK in 2014.  She commenced employment as a teacher on a
    salary of �37,000 per annum.  The Appellant  applied  for  entry  as  a
    visitor but that was refused.

14. She stated that the Appellant is estranged from his wife and  that  the
    separation took  place  in  2009.   The  whereabouts  of  his  wife  is
    currently unknown.

15. She said that she and the Appellant continued  their  relationship  and
    presently she visits the Appellant twice a year.

16. She outlined that the Appellant had commenced annulment proceedings  in
    the Philippines  but  apparently  a  lawyer  took  money  off  him  and
    effectively "took him for a  ride".   Nevertheless  their  relationship
    continues and they speak on the telephone almost daily.

17. In cross-examination Ms Fijiwala asked the Sponsor whether she had ever
    investigated the possibility of the couple being able to live  together
    in the Philippines.  The Sponsor said that she would  not  be  able  to
    gain any status there - it is a conservative society  -  and  it  would
    therefore be difficult to live as a couple.  Presently she visits on  a
    visit visa for a restricted amount of time.

18. The Sponsor was then asked whether  she  and  the  Appellant  had  ever
    discussed the possibility of living elsewhere,  for  example  Singapore
    where they had met.  She said candidly that they had not discussed this
    possibility because she works presently in  the  UK,  has  her  pension
    rights here and in addition she lends support to her  elderly  parents.
    Her mother suffers from dementia.

19. The Sponsor was then  asked  about  the  position  of  the  Appellant's
    children.   She  said  that  his  older  children  are  aware  of   the
    relationship.  The eldest is now 20 years of age.  Their mother  is  no
    longer on the scene and the youngest child whose date of birth  is  May
    2010 is looked  after  by  his  older  siblings.   That  concluded  her
    evidence.



Consideration

20. The central question before me is whether the ECO's refusal is contrary
    to the Appellant and Sponsor's Article 8 ECHR  rights  in  that  it  is
    disproportionate, when considering the specific circumstances  of  this
    appeal.  I am satisfied that family life exists between  the  Appellant
    and Sponsor because the FtT's finding on this point was not challenged.
    Therefore applying the Razgar test, the ultimate  question  is  whether
    when weighing factors in the balance, is any interference proportionate
    to the need for immigration control?

21. I find that I am satisfied that, because of the circumstances  of  this
    case, family life in the sense of living together as husband  and  wife
    or in a relationship akin to marriage,  can  only  take  place  in  the
    United Kingdom.  I accept the expert's report that the Philippines is a
    country that does not recognise divorce.  To obtain a speedy  annulment
    requires influence of the sort  that  neither  the  Appellant  nor  the
    sponsor possess.

22. I accept the Sponsor's evidence that the best she can  arrange  in  the
    circumstances that she finds herself in,  is  to  visit  the  Appellant
    twice a year and stay with him in a hotel.  She can only  visit  for  a
    restricted amount of time on a visit visa.  Because of the conservative
    nature of society in the Philippines and because it will take time  and
    expense for the Appellant to obtain an annulment, this is all that  she
    is able to do.   Ms  Fijiwala  quite  properly  accepted  the  expert's
    evidence that it would take somewhere  between  two  to  six  years  to
    obtain the necessary annulment.

23. In these circumstances I find it cannot be said  that  the  couple  are
    making a lifestyle choice to live together in the United  Kingdom.   On
    the contrary it is their only realistic option if  they  wish  to  live
    together in the way that normal married couples do.

24. The Sponsor was quite candid in her evidence when  she  said  that  the
    couple had not looked at the possibility of setting up home  elsewhere,
    but I find that that would not be a practical undertaking.  The Sponsor
    holds a responsible job in the  United  Kingdom  -  she  is  a  teacher
    earning �37,000 a year. Furthermore, although her reluctance  to  leave
    her elderly parents might not be determinative, it  nevertheless  lends
    weight to her situation.

25. Ms Bustani did ask that I also take into account the fact that  if  the
    Appellant's appeal was successful, then the normal grant of leave under
    Article 8 would be two and a half years,  and  this  would  enable  the
    Appellant to seek his divorce via the UK courts.  I make no comment  in
    that regard.  My task is to decide whether the  Appellant's  appeal  is
    allowed or dismissed.  The length of time of any grant of  leave  under
    Article 8 is a matter for the Secretary of State to determine.

26. In coming to my decision, I do take into account that it has  not  been
    challenged  that  the  parties  are  in  a   genuine   and   subsisting
    relationship and that, in view of Miss Denny's earnings, there would be
    no call on the public purse.  I understand that the Appellant can speak
    English.

27. For the foregoing reasons I am satisfied that the Appellant  has  shown
    that  refusal  of  entry  clearance  in   his   case   amounts   to   a
    disproportionate interference with both his rights  and  those  of  the
    Sponsor.  Accordingly this appeal is allowed.
