                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Algeria, born on 29 July  1974.  This  is
    his appeal against the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Carroll
    ("the judge"), promulgated on 11 December 2019, by which she  dismissed
    the appellant's appeal against the refusal of his human rights claim by
    the respondent on 11 January 2019.

 2. In essence, that claim was based on the appellant's  lengthy  residence
    in the United Kingdom, the great majority of  which  had  been  lawful.
    Having arrived with leave in October 2003, his status  remained  lawful
    until 19 May 2010 after which it is accepted that there was a gap until
    further leave was granted as a Tier 1 Migrant on 20 June 2011.  An  in-
    time extension application in the  same  category  was  made  and  then
    refused. A subsequent appeal was allowed and the appellant was  granted
    further until 9 February 2018. 10 August 2016  the  appellant  made  an
    application for indefinite leave to remain on the basis of five  years'
    lawful residence in the Tier 1 category. This was refused solely  under
    paragraph 322(9) of the Immigration Rules ("the Rules") because  of  an
    allegation that he had failed to respond to a request  for  information
    relating to his tax affairs. In the absence of a right of  appeal,  the
    appellant sought Administrative Review,  but  on  21  August  2017  the
    refusal decision was maintained. On 9 February 2018 (the  last  day  of
    his grant of leave  as  a  Tier  1  Migrant),  the  appellant  made  an
    application for indefinite leave to remain on the  basis  of  his  long
    residence. This application was treated as a human  rights  claim,  the
    refusal of which led to the appeal in the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. It can be seen from the above that  the  appellant  continues  to  have
    leave to remain, pursuant to section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971.

The judge's decision

 4. I am satisfied that the appellant put his case  to  the  judge  in  the
    following way. First, that he had been in the United  Kingdom  lawfully
    for many years and had lost meaningful ties to Algeria. Second, the gap
    in leave between 2010 and 2011 was down  to  poor  advice  by  previous
    legal representatives and should not be held against him.  Third,  that
    the respondent's refusal of the indefinite leave to remain  application
    on the basis of paragraph 322(9) of the Rules was wrong  and  therefore
    he should have been granted settlement,  this  being  relevant  to  the
    issue if proportionality. Fourth, all  of  the  relevant  circumstances
    rendered the respondent's refusal of his human rights claim unlawful.

 5. The judge addressed the paragraph 322(9)  issue  at  [11]-[17]  of  her
    decision. She concluded that this provision did not  apply,  and  never
    should have applied, to the appellant. For  reasons  that  will  become
    apparent, that was a significant finding.

 6. The judge went on to consider the appellant's private life (family life
    not having been  relied  on).  At  [19]-[22]  she  concluded  that  the
    appellant  would  not  face  very  significant  obstacles  to  his  re-
    integration into Algerian society and could not  rely  on  the  alleged
    incompetence of previous legal representatives in respect of the gap in
    leave between 2010 and 2011.

 7. In considering Article 8 in its wider ambit outside the  scope  of  the
    Rules, the judge  recognised  the  "significant  period  of  time"  the
    appellant had spent in the United Kingdom. She noted  that  this  leave
    had been on a precarious basis throughout. Towards the end of [24]  the
    judge said the following:

           "It is  well  established  that,  in  the  case  of  non-settled
           migrants,  it  is  only  in  exceptional  circumstances  that  a
           decision to remove would give rise to a  breach  of  Article  8.
           There are no  exceptional  circumstances  in  the  case  of  the
           appellant and I find  that  the  decision  under  appeal  is  in
           accordance with the law, necessary and proportionate and that it
           does not give rise to a breach of Article 8."

 8. Then, the judge referred to the appellant's assertion that, but for the
    respondent's error in applying paragraph 322(9) of the Rules to him, he
    would  have  been  granted  indefinite  leave  to  remain  some   years
    previously. In respect of this, at [26] the judge stated that:

           "I make no findings in relation to  the  alternative  route  for
           leave to remain proposed by the appellant. It is [a] matter  for
           him to pursue with the respondent."

 9. The appeal was duly dismissed.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

10. Three grounds of appeal were put forward: first,  that  the  judge  had
    erred in respect of the failings of the previous legal representatives;
    second, that she failed to have any  or  any  adequate  regard  to  the
    appellant's lawful residence in the United Kingdom, in particular  that
    relating to Tier 1 and the argument that he should  have  been  granted
    indefinite leave to remain by the respondent  previously;  third,  that
    the judge had failed to conduct an adequate balancing exercise.

11. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Cruthers
    on 15 May 2020.

The hearing before me

12. Mr Sedeghi relied on the grounds of appeal and his  skeleton  argument.
    He submitted  that  the  failure  of  the  judge  to  engage  with  the
    consequences of her finding on paragraph 322(9) of  the  Rules  in  the
    context of the appellant's Article 8 claim was a material error.

13. Having applied her customary careful consideration to  the  issues,  as
    set out in  the  grounds  of  appeal  and  then  expanded  on  in  oral
    submissions, Ms Everett accepted that the judge had indeed committed  a
    material error, as alleged by Mr Sedeghi.

Decision on error of law

14. In my  judgment,  the  concession  made  by  Ms  Everett  was  entirely
    appropriate. Once the favourable finding on the paragraph 322(9)  issue
    had been made, it was then incumbent on the judge to factor that in  to
    the rest of the appellant's Article 8 case, as it was put to her.  That
    included the argument that the overall lawful residence in  the  United
    Kingdom, but in particular the continuous period  spent  as  a  Tier  1
    Migrant, was highly relevant  to  the  issue  of  proportionality.  The
    effect of  the  judge's  finding  on  paragraph  322(9)  was  that  the
    appellant had suffered a "historical injustice", as  described  by  the
    Upper Tribunal in the recent case of Patel  (historic  injustice;  NIAA
    Part 5A) [2020] UKUT 00351 (IAC). Such cases are highly fact-sensitive.
    What the judge should have done was to address  the  Tier  1/indefinite
    leave  to  remain  issue  directly  and  incorporate  that   into   the
    proportionality balancing exercise. Her failure to do so, as  evidenced
    by her disinclination to make any findings, was in my  view  clearly  a
    material error.

15. On this basis, I set the judge's decision aside.

16. I would add a further point. Whilst it did not feature in Ms  Everett's
    concession, I agree with the grounds of appeal to the extent  that,  at
    [24], there is a distinct probability that the judge  was  interpreting
    the  need  to  show  "exceptional  circumstances"  not  simply   as   a
    description of outcomes, but a threshold question to be overcome by the
    appellant. This constituted an additional error of law  which  I  would
    regard as material.

The re-make decision

17. Having announced my decision on the error of law issue at the  hearing,
    both representatives  agreed  that  I  could  and  should  re-make  the
    decision in this case on the materials before me.

Submissions

18. Ms Everett highlighted what she described  as  the  lack  of  any  real
    evidence on the establishment of meaningful ties by  the  appellant  in
    the United Kingdom, notwithstanding his lengthy residence. It was clear
    that he would not face very  significant  obstacles  to  re-integrating
    into Algerian society.  As  to  the  historical  injustice  point,  she
    accepted that it was relevant and that the weight attributable to  this
    was a matter for the Tribunal. She submitted that this  issue  did  not
    tip the balance in the appellant's favour.

19. Mr Sedeghi relied on his skeleton argument and the  evidence  contained
    in  the  appellant's  bundle  which  had  been  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. He submitted  that  the  time  away  from  Algeria  was  very
    significant. The appellant had made good use of his time in the  United
    Kingdom and would be an asset to  this  country  if  allowed  to  stay.
    Reliance was placed on the historical injustice issue.

Findings and conclusions

20. I find that the appellant's  immigration  history  is  as  set  out  in
    paragraph 2, above. Therefore, the appellant has  been  in  the  United
    Kingdom now for 17 years and 2 months, with all but 394  days  of  this
    period being lawful (those days representing the gap between  2010  and
    2011 referred to previously). The appellant currently  has  statutorily
    extended leave pursuant to section 3C  of  the  Immigration  Act  1971.
    Indeed, as of 20 June 2021, the appellant will have been  lawfully  and
    continuously in this country for 10 years.

21. It is common ground that the appellant has, as result  of  his  lengthy
    residence, established a private life in  this  country.  There  is  no
    reliance on any family life aspect of Article 8.  It  has  also  agreed
    that the respondent's decision interferes with the private life.

22. There is no sound reason for me to simply reject the  entirety  of  the
    appellant's evidence as to the cause of the gap in his leave  as  being
    untruthful. It is unfortunately fairly common to see instances of  poor
    legal advice. I am prepared to  accept  that  the  appellant  genuinely
    believes that he was let down. Having said that, he has not  put  these
    allegations in a detailed manner over the course of time,  nor  has  he
    provided any evidence to indicate that he has presented a complaint  to
    those representatives or any other supervisory body. Having  regard  to
    Mansur (immigration adviser's failings: Article  8)  Bangladesh  [2018]
    UKUT 274  (IAC),  I  am  not  satisfied  that  there  was  professional
    negligence on the part of his previous representatives. In  any  event,
    this issue does not, on the particular facts of  this  case,  take  the
    appellant's Article 8 claim any further.

23. The gap in the appellant's leave between 2010 and 2011 has  the  effect
    that he has never been able to rely on paragraph 276B of the Rules.

24. I find that the appellant had continuous leave  as  a  Tier  1  Migrant
    between 20 June 2011 until 9 February 2018, whereupon  that  leave  was
    statutorily extended.

25. For the same reasons set out by the judge  in  her  decision  (none  of
    which have  been  criticised  by  the  respondent),  I  too  find  that
    paragraph 322(9) was erroneously applied to the appellant in respect of
    his application for indefinite leave to remain made on 10 August  2016.
    I have seen the decision letter refusing  that  application,  dated  24
    July 2017, together with the Administrative Review decision, and it  is
    plain that the sole basis of refusal was paragraph 322(9). It is in  my
    view an inescapable conclusion that but for the respondent's  erroneous
    application of that provision, the appellant would  have  been  granted
    indefinite leave to remain at that time. That  is,  in  the  particular
    circumstances of this case and for the reasons set out  below,  a  very
    significant factor.

26. The decision in Patel rightly urges caution when assessing what  should
    properly  be  described  as  a   historical   injustice.   Difficulties
    encountered  by  individuals  relating   to   employers   or   teaching
    institutions are, in the main, unlikely materially  reduce  the  public
    interest in maintaining effective immigration control. The present case
    is different in nature. The  injustice  was  a  direct  result  of  the
    respondent erroneously applying a general  ground  of  refusal  to  the
    appellant's application  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain.  As  noted
    previously, it was the sole basis for refusing a grant of settlement. I
    take account of the fact that the refusal decision  and  Administrative
    Review were not (as far as I am aware) the subject of  judicial  review
    proceedings. That may be seen to count against the weight  attributable
    to the respondent's error. On the other hand, it is a fact that at  the
    time the appellant still had extant leave to remain as a Tier 1 Migrant
    and he was, in my view, justified in making a further  application  for
    leave to remain  prior  to  the  expiry  of  that  leave,  rather  than
    launching a legal challenge.

27. What emerges from the  above  is  a  strong  example  of  a  "but  for"
    situation in which the respondent error was  the  causative  basis  for
    denying the appellant settlement.

28. The fact that the appellant would have been  entitled  to  a  grant  of
    indefinite  leave  to  remain  but  for  the  respondent's   error   is
    significant because it distinguishes this case from  one  in  which  an
    individual had simply sought an extension of limited leave  to  remain.
    The appellant had, by virtue of his leave as a Tier 1 Migrant, been  at
    the very end of the the path to settlement and thus, whilst his  status
    was precarious, it was less so than in respect of someone who could not
    at the time have applied for indefinite leave to remain.

29. In assessing the weight to be placed on this feature of the appellant's
    case, I guard against double counting (see Patel at paragraph 84). When
    considering  the  mandatory  considerations  in  section  117B  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, as  amended,  I  conclude
    that  the  public  interest  subsection  (1)  is,  in  the   particular
    circumstances of this case, significantly reduced as a  consequence  of
    what is undoubtedly a historical injustice suffered by the appellant.

30. I take full account of  subsection  (5)  and  therefore  attach  little
    weight to the appellant's private life itself, although this of  course
    is to be seen in what I have said in the preceding paragraph.

31. It is right that there  is  not  a  great  deal  of  detailed  evidence
    relating to the ties established by the appellant whilst in the  United
    Kingdom. I accept that he has worked, formed friendships, and to put it
    bluntly, got on with his life in this  country  in  a  relatively  non-
    descript manner. In  that  sense  (and  leaving  aside  the  historical
    injustice issue),  there  are  no  particularly  strong  or  compelling
    features of his private life. Whilst I have no doubt that the appellant
    would continue to work and contribute to the  general  economy  of  the
    United Kingdom if permitted to remain, it cannot properly be said  that
    his contribution to society is of such significance as to amount to  an
    important factor in the balance exercise.

32. I agree with the judge's analysis of  the  very  significant  obstacles
    issue. The appellant has been  away  from  Algeria  for  a  long  time.
    However, on the evidence before me he is a  well-educated  and  capable
    individual who retains family connections in that  country  and  would,
    with or without specific support, be able to re-integrate into Algerian
    society without facing very significant difficulties. I take this  into
    account in respect of my overall balancing exercise.

33. I take account of the fact that the appellant is unable to meet any  of
    the specific Rules relating to Article 8. This clearly  counts  against
    him and in favour of the respondent.

34.  The  appellant  clearly  speaks  good  English  and   is   financially
    independent. These are both neutral factors.

35. Bringing all of the above together, I conclude as follows. It  is  rare
    indeed for an appeal based on Article 8 to succeed by  a  wide  margin.
    The present appeal is not such a  case.  However,  having  conducted  a
    balancing exercise involving all matters relevant to  the  question  of
    whether the respondent's refusal of the human rights  claim  strikes  a
    fair balance between protected rights and the  public  interest,  I  am
    satisfied that the appellant succeeds. His overall very lengthy  lawful
    residence in this country is clearly important. However, of predominant
    significance is the historical injustice suffered by the  appellant  in
    the context of what would otherwise have been a certain (or as close to
    certain as needs be) grant of indefinite leave to remain.  It  is  this
    factor which reduces the public interest sufficiently for the appellant
    to show that the respondent's decision under appeal is disproportionate
    and therefore unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

Anonymity

36. The First-tier Tribunal made no anonymity direction  and  there  is  no
    reason for me to do so. I make no such direction.



Notice of Decision

37. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

38. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

39. I re-make the decision by allowing the appeal on Article 8 grounds.
