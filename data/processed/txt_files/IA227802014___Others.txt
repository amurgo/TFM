Representation:
For the Appellants:    Ms Peterson of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of Sri Lanka.  The first appellant was born
    on 5 August 1980.  The second appellant is her husband  and  the  third
    appellant is their son who was  born  on  11  March  2009.   The  first
    appellant made a combined application for leave to remain as a  Tier  4
    (General) Student - Dependant, which application  was  refused  by  the
    respondent on 9 May 2014 because she failed to meet the requirements of
    paragraph 245ZX(b).  That was because her most recent  grant  of  leave
    was as a Tier 4 (General) Dependent Partner.  As she did not  have,  or
    was not last granted, leave in one of the  appropriate  categories  set
    out in paragraph 245ZX(b) she failed to  meet  the  requirements.   The
    applications of her husband and child fell to be refused in  line  with
    the first appellant's application.

 2. The appellants' appeals against the respondent's refusal  were  allowed
    by Judge Somal ("the Judge")  in  a  determination  promulgated  on  11
    August 2014.  The grounds claimed, whilst being out of time,  that  the
    Judge's finding that the first appellant's Article 8 right to a private
    life was engaged by her continued studies in  the  UK  amounted  to  an
    error of law and, further, that the Judge failed to have  regard  to  a
    material consideration, that the first appellant's  estimated  date  of
    delivery, would have passed by the time of the hearing.

 3. Judge Saffer refused the respondent permission to appeal out  of  time.
    Given the explanation for the delay was that there was  a  shortage  of
    resources, Judge Saffer declined to exercise his discretion  to  extend
    time on the basis that a decision in favour of the respondent would  be
    that she could ignore all time limits despite  vast  resources  at  her
    disposal and thereby create an unworkable Tribunal system.

 4. Upper Tribunal Judge Storey granted permission to appeal.  He concurred
    with the grounds before him that it was not apparent that  in  deciding
    the timeliness issue, Judge Saffer had regard to the arguable merits of
    the case.  Upper Tribunal Judge Storey found the grounds otherwise  had
    arguable merit because the Judge's reasons for allowing the appellants'
    Article 8 appeal on private life grounds were arguably irrational.   In
    considering that the first appellant's pregnancy justified a grant of a
    short period of lawful leave to remain, the  Judge  arguably  erred  in
    law.

Submissions on Error of Law

 5. The advocates drew my attention to [6] of  the  judge's  determination.
    The first appellant discovered she needed to return  to  Sri  Lanka  to
    apply to switch her visa status in January 2014.  Her  last  period  of
    leave expired on 11 April 2014 as a Tier 4 (General) Dependant  Partner
    of a Tier 4 (General) Student.  Travel arrangements  were  made  for  5
    April but due to complications with the pregnancy, she was advised  not
    to travel at that time, which was four  weeks  prior  to  her  delivery
    date.  The second appellant's student visa expired on  11  April  2014.
    They decided the first appellant should apply instead of him  extending
    his visa, as his classes ended in April 2014 and he only had  a  couple
    of subjects left on his three year ACCA course.  The appellant had paid
    ï¿½2,500 for the college course for one year after she passed  her  IELTS
    on 28 March 2014.

 6. Ms Peterson submitted that the judge did not  err  in  considering  the
    situation in the round under Article 8, bearing in mind she took  other
    factors into account, in particular, that  the  first  appellant  would
    have lost money on the course and there would have  been  other  family
    disruptions.  But for the medical situation, the family would not  have
    found themselves in that situation which, as the judge found, was  only
    for a short period.

Conclusion on Error of Law

 7. I find the judge  erred  in  failing  to  have  regard  to  a  material
    consideration  at  the  date  of  the  hearing,  that  is,  the   first
    appellant's date of delivery was in the past and that there was nothing
    to suggest the family were unable to return at that stage, other than a
    reluctance to do so because the course was almost at an  end  and  fees
    had been paid.  See  Patel  [2013]  UKSC  72  at  [57].   As  per  Lord
    Carnwath, inter alia, "The  opportunity  for  a  promising  student  to
    complete his course in  this  country,  however  desirable  in  general
    terms, is not in itself a right protected under Article 8."

 8. The respondent has shown errors of law in the determination, such  that
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be set aside. I  re-make
    the decision by dismissing the appeal.

Decision

9.   Appeal dismissed
