                            DECISION AND REASONS

Claim History

1. The appeal of the Appellant against the refusal  of  the  Respondent  to
   grant her further leave to remain in the UK as the spouse of  Mr  Shaban
   Mahmood, a British citizen, was dismissed by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
   Ghani (the Judge) under Article 8 ECHR in a decision promulgated  on  11
   August 2016.


2. Prior to the hearing, by letter dated  10  August  2016  from  her  then
   representatives, Iqbal  Law  Chambers,  the  Appellant  applied  for  an
   adjournment on the basis that her partner had sudden  chest  pains,  was
   unwell and could not attend court. This letter had  attached  to  it  an
   employee's statement of sickness, which is a self-certification, and  in
   which Mr Mahmood stated that his period of sickness started on 9  August
   2015, although the date on which it ended  could  either  be  10  or  15
   August 2015. However, if it is 15 August 2015, it is not  clear  how  Mr
   Mahmood would have known that the back,  chest  and  shoulder  pains  he
   described would end on 15 August,  when  the  letter  was  faxed  on  10
   August. The request was refused on the basis that (i)  being  unable  to
   attend for work was different from not being able to attend  a  hearing;
   (ii) the Appellant had  failed  to  submit  any  documents  despite  the
   directions sent out on 30 June 2016; and she had (iii) thereby failed to
   co-operate with the Tribunal.  It  was  noted  in  the  notification  of
   refusal that the late request to  adjourn  the  hearing  was  simply  an
   attempt to delay the hearing, which was contrary  to  the  interests  of
   justice.


3. The Appellant attended the first-tier Tribunal without a  representative
   and  without  Mr  Mahmood,  her  husband.  She  again  applied  for   an
   adjournment  on  the  grounds  that   she   wished   to   seek   another
   representative. This was refused because she had had sufficient time  to
   prepare her case and to seek  other  representatives,  and  because  her
   partner had not attended and the only evidence provided as to  his  non-
   attendance was a self-certification and no medical evidence.

4. Permission to appeal was granted in the following terms:

         "3. The grounds complain that the Judge erred in Law by 1. Refusing
         to grant her  an  adjournment  to  seek  legal  representation  and
         provide supporting medical evidence in support of  her  appeal;  2.
         Failure to properly consider the evidence regarding the risk to the
         Appellant's husband in considering the parties circumstances and in
         particular as to whether there are  significant  obstacles  to  the
         Appellant returning to Pakistan; 3. Failure to have  proper  regard
         to the Appellant's husband's especial circumstances; 4. Failure  to
         consider the risk to the Appellant if she returns in light  of  her
         fear of persecution; 5 Failure to have  due/proper  regard  to  the
         sick certificate in respect of the Appellant's husband.


         4. I have read the decision made by Judge Ghani with care and  note
         that whilst reference was made to the sick certificate submitted in
         respect of the Appellant's husband,  it  was  then  noted  that  no
         medical evidence had been submitted with regard to  his  condition.
         This reference was inherently inconsistent.


         5. In a very short decision (3 pages), Judge Ghani  had  made  very
         brief findings (3 paragraphs) with regard to all  the  issue  under
         appeal. Bearing in mind the nature and complexities of  the  issues
         under appeal, especially in light of the fact  that  the  Appellant
         was unrepresented and had also sought an adjournment to present the
         evidence. There appears to have been an  arguable  failure  on  the
         part of the Judge to have proper regard to  all  the  evidence  and
         law.


         6. It is arguable that the Judge failed to  properly  undertake  an
         assessment  of  the  particular  risk  to  the  Appellant  or   the
         Appellant's husband.


         7. The above grounds disclose arguable errors of law".

5. For the purposes of the hearing, a large bundle had  been  submitted  on
   behalf of the Appellant. We made clear to the parties that we would  not
   be considering this evidence for  the  purposes  of  the  error  of  law
   hearing; we could only consider the evidence that was before the Judge.


6. Mr Salam, on behalf of the Appellant, relied on his  skeleton  argument.
   He also submitted that:

        a. The Appellant had not been properly advised; she had trusted her
           solicitors and they had  not  asked  her  for  any  evidence  in
           support of her appeal, so she had asked for  an  adjournment  to
           seek new representatives so that she could have a fair  hearing.
           Her solicitors had not submitted a bundle or witness statements.
           He stated that the Appellant had thought that  if  she  did  not
           have a representative, she would get an adjournment.


        b. The decision was only three pages long. The Judge had considered
           whether there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
           continuing in Pakistan, when there was no need to  consider  the
           provisions of para EX.1(b) of Appendix FM because it was  stated
           in the decision that  the  Appellant  met  the  suitability  and
           eligibility requirements and therefore may  have  qualified  for
           leave as the spouse of a British national,  particularly  as  it
           was stated in  the  covering  letter  that  was  sent  with  the
           Appellant's application that the Sponsor  earned  �1,583.33  per
           month, which equated to �19,000 per annum. Both  the  Respondent
           and the Judge had jumped into a consideration of the  provisions
           of EX.1(b) without ascertaining if it was necessary.


        c. The Judge did not follow AK (Iran) v SSHD [2008]  EWCA  Civ  94,
           where it was found that it was an error of law not to  grant  an
           adjournment where  the  representative  withdraws  at  the  last
           minute, and Nwaigwe [2014] UKUT 418 (IAC), which gave primacy to
           the criterion of fairness. Further, Rule 4(3)(h) of the Tribunal
           Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber)
           Rules 2014 permits the Judge to adjourn or postpone a hearing.


   7. In view of the guidance in SV  (Alleging  misconduct  and  suppressing
      evidence) Iran [2005] UKAIT 00160 and BT (Former  solicitors'  alleged
      misconduct) Nepal [2004] UKIAT 00311, in which it was found that if an
      appeal is based in whole or in part on allegations about  the  conduct
      of  former  representatives,  there  must  be  evidence   that   those
      allegations have been  put  to  the  former  representative,  and  the
      Tribunal  must  be  shown  either  the  response   or   correspondence
      indicating that there has been no response. Mr Salam was asked if  the
      alleged failures of the Appellant's solicitors had been put  to  them,
      that is,  whether  they  had  written  to  them  in  relation  to  the
      Appellant's complaints about their conduct. He said that he  had  not,
      and that his firm had received instructions from the  Appellant  after
      she had received the notice of today's hearing, which was sometime  in
      May of this year. He confirmed that the Appellant had  not  instructed
      them to write a letter of complaint  to  her  former  representatives,
      although she had been upset because she said that she had paid them  a
      lot of money.

8. On behalf of the Respondent, Mr Mills submitted that:


        a. Allegations against previous solicitors could not be used as  an
           excuse for failing to submit evidence unless the allegations had
           been put to them and they had  either  responded  or  failed  to
           respond. There was no  evidence  before  us  of  any  complaints
           having been made to the previous solicitors.


        b. The Appellant applied using form FLR(FP), this was not the usual
           application for an application for leave to remain as the spouse
           of British national under the 5 year route.  It  was  a  private
           life application outside the Rules. Although it was noted in the
           covering letter that the Sponsor earned �1,583.33 per month,  it
           may have been that the specified evidence had not been provided.
           In any event, the Appellant did not come with any documents  and
           it is difficult to see how the Judge could have dealt  with  the
           hearing differently.


        c. As to the absence of the Sponsor, the  adjournment  request  had
           previously been refused. The  Appellant's  solicitors  had  been
           instructed for several months. They had not confirmed  that  the
           Appellant had not had adequate time to prepare for the hearing.


        d. Although the guidance  in  Nwaigwe  focussed  on  fairness,  the
           provisions of Rule 4(3)(h) of the Procedure Rules, could not  be
           an open door to adjournment requests on demand. It was  open  to
           the Judge to refuse the application.


9. In reply,  Mr  Salam  submitted  that  the  Appellant  had  been  denied
   representation at the  last  minute,  and  reliance  was  placed  on  SH
   (Afghanistan) v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 1284. AK (Iran) provided that  even
   if a previous  adjournment  request  had  been  refused,  it  was  still
   necessary to  grant  a  request  where  a  previous  representative  had
   withdrawn at the last minute. He submitted that the case-law was "on our
   side".


10. It was put to Mr Salam that when the request was made in writing,  there
   was nothing in the representative's letter of 10 August 2016 to say that
   they had not had sufficient time to prepare  for  the  hearing,  yet  no
   bundle had been submitted. The only reference was to the health  of  the
   Appellant. He was asked if the Appellant  had  instructed  them  not  to
   attend so that she could gain more time to prepare. Mr Salam stated that
   the Appellant had said that she had paid them everything  and  they  had
   charged her a lot of money. When asked  if  she  had  given  her  former
   representatives any documents, he said that they had not asked  her  for
   any and she had thought that maybe they did  not  need  them.  Mr  Salam
   stated that the Appellant thought that  if  she  instructed  solicitors,
   they would do the paperwork.

Decision and reasons

11. We do not find that the Judge materially erred in law  in  refusing  the
   adjournment request for the following reasons:

12. The Appellant was represented at all times prior to the  hearing  before
   Judge Ghani. He found that a previous adjournment request  on  the  same
   basis had been refused. Although  the  Appellant  attended  the  hearing
   without a representative, she had been represented to  10  August  2016,
   the  day  before  the  hearing.  There   is   no   suggestion   in   the
   representative's letter, in which the adjournment  was  requested,  that
   they were not prepared to attend the hearing if the request was refused.
   The letter was written in the following terms (inaccuracies  as  in  the
   original):


         "We note from the refusal letter that the  main  issue  before  the
         tribunal   is   the   Appellants   partners   medical   conditions.
         Unfortunately, we have been instructed that as the result of sudden
         chest pains the Appellants Partner is unwell to attend court on  11
         August 2016. See attached a copy of  the  Employee's  statement  of
         sickness for your attention.


         In light of the above, we submit it would be unfair and  unjust  to
         deny  the  Appellant   an   adjournment   considering   the   above
         circumstances and in particular where the  Appellants  Partner  has
         ongoing medical conditions and his evidence is vital to the outcome
         of the appeal.


         We further submit that the tribunal would not be  able  to  make  a
         full article 8 assessment in the absence of the Appellants Partners
         oral evidence.


         We humbly request that considering the  above  circumstances  as  a
         whole the tribunal should conclude that it would render  it  unjust
         to not grant an adjournment for at least 2 weeks  from  the  appeal
         hearing date in order for the  Appellants  partner  to  be  fit  to
         attend court".


13. As noted  in  the  refusal  of  the  adjournment  request,  there  is  a
   difference between being unfit to go to work and being unfit  to  attend
   court. There was no medical evidence to  suggest  that  the  Appellant's
   husband could not attend court; The evidence before Judge Ghani was  not
   medical  evidence  from  a  medical  practitioner;  it   was   a   self-
   certification from the Appellant's husband and  it  was  open  to  Judge
   Ghani to so find.


14. When Judge Ghani refused the adjournment request,  he  would  have  been
   aware of the contents of the letter of request  and  the  terms  of  the
   refusal.  He  would  also  have  been   aware   that   the   Appellant's
   representatives then wrote a further letter on 10 August 2016, in  which
   they stated that "We are no longer the instructed representatives of the
   above named persons appeal matter and if you could  kindly  update  your
   records accordingly." This does not  suggest  that  the  representatives
   withdrew; it suggests that their instructions were withdrawn, to support
   the Appellant's  position  before  Judge  Ghani  that  she  was  without
   representation.


15. Although there was significant emphasis on  the  Appellant  having  been
   let down by her former representatives, the evidence before Judge  Ghani
   did not suggest that the Appellant had  been  let  down  by  her  former
   representatives;  the  evidence  was   that   the   Appellant's   former
   representatives were no longer  instructed.  This  is  supported  by  Mr
   Salam's submission that the Appellant thought that if she did not have a
   representative she would get  an  adjournment.  There  was  no  evidence
   before us  to  support  the  submission  that  the  fault  for  lack  of
   preparation  for  the  hearing  lay  at   the   door   of   her   former
   representatives. Even though she now has new representation, and we  are
   told that she has complained to  them  of  the  conduct  of  her  former
   representatives, these complaints  have  not  been  put  to  her  former
   representatives and we find that these allegations are  unsubstantiated.
   There was no reliable evidence before Judge Ghani  that  an  adjournment
   would mean that the Appellant was  better  prepared  for  a  substantive
   hearing, or that  her  husband  would  attend  such  a  hearing,  if  he
   adjourned the hearing particularly as Judge Ghani recorded at  [6]  that
   the Appellant stated that her husband was due to go  to  his  GP  on  10
   August 2016 (the day before the hearing) and refused to  attend.  Whilst
   we accept in principle that  an  unfair  decision  on  an  interlocutory
   matter, such as an adjournment request, can amount to an  error  of  law
   (SH (Afghanistan)), we find that Judge Ghani did not materially  err  in
   law in refusing the adjournment request.


16. As to paragraphs 6 and 7 of the terms of  the  grant  of  permission  to
   appeal, as set out at paragraph 4 above,  no  issues  were  raised  with
   regard to risk on return in the grounds of appeal (as  attached  to  the
   notice of appeal) before Judge Ghani, and it  would  appear  that  these
   were raised for the first time at the hearing.  Although  Judge  Ghani's
   decision is short and a number of issues were raised by  the  Appellant,
   the Judge's findings were that despite the assertions of  the  Appellant
   as to risk on return,  she  had  made  no  application  for  asylum  and
   provided no evidence to substantiate her assertions. These findings were
   open to him on the evidence before him (see [6] and [8]);  the  evidence
   before the Judge was extremely vague (see [6]).


17. Mr Salam submitted that the Respondent and the Judge  had  jumped  to  a
   consideration of insurmountable obstacles, when  they  should  not  have
   because it was stated in  the  reasons  for  refusal  letter,  dated  28
   October 2016 (the reasons letter), which was sent to the Appellant, that
   the suitability and the eligibility criteria  were  met.  Therefore,  he
   submitted, the provisions of the Immigration Rules were satisfied.


18. However, as submitted by Mr Mills, there  was  no  evidence  to  suggest
   that the application was made under the  5  year  partner  route.  There
   would have been no need to consider EX.1(b) in the reasons letter if the
   Appellant had met all the requirements of R-LTRP.1.1(c)(i) and  (c)(ii).
   Because the application did not appear to have been  made  under  the  5
   year partner route (and there is no evidence in the Respondent's  bundle
   to indicate that any financial evidence was  submitted  to  support  the
   assertion in the covering letter sent  with  the  application  that  the
   Appellant's  husband  earned  �1,583.33  per  month),  the   eligibility
   provisions that were met were R-LTRP.1.1(d)(ii) (i.e, the provisions  of
   E-LTRP.1.2 - 1.12 and E-LTRP.2.1. - 2.2 and not all the provisions of E-
   LTRP.1.2 - 4.2, as required by R-LTRP.1.1(c)(ii) with  reference  to  E-
   LTRP.1.1), it was appropriate for the  Respondent  and  Judge  Ghani  to
   consider the provisions of Appendix FM para EX.1(b), and we find that no
   material errors of law are disclosed in Judge Ghani's  approach  or  his
   findings.


19. We find that, read as a whole, the Judge's findings were open to him  on
   the evidence before him and no  arguable  material  errors  of  law  are
   disclosed. As the Appellant has  now  provided  a  substantial  body  of
   evidence, the appropriate course for her is to submit a new  application
   with the correct supporting evidence.

Decision


20. There is no material error of law in the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's
    decision. The decision stands.

Anonymity

21. The First-tier Tribunal made no order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of  the
    Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005. On the facts of
    this case, we see no reasons to make such an order pursuant to Rule  14
    of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
