For the Appellant: Mr M Mustafe (Solicitor, Kalam Solicitors)
For the Respondent: Ms H Aboni (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The Appellant's appeal against the Secretary of State's refusal of his
   application for leave to remain in the UK was dismissed by First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Beg in a decision promulgated on the 22nd of September
   2016. The Appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal in
   grounds dated the 4th of October 2016, permission was granted by Kelly on
   the 19th of April 2017.

2. The Appellant had sought leave to remain in the UK on the basis of his
   relationship with the Sponsor and their children. The application had
   been refused for a number of reasons, original documentation had not been
   provided despite being requested. The Appellant did not meet the
   requirements of Appendix FM and so paragraph EX.1 did not apply. The
   Appellant did not qualify under paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules
   and there were no very significant obstacles to his reintegration into
   Bangladesh.

3. The evidence at the hearing was set out in paragraphs 5 to 10 of the
   decision. The Appellant gave a number of reasons why he could not return
   to Bangladesh. He had come on a visit intending to leave but met his wife
   and married, in contrast her evidence was that he had come to the UK to
   marry her, her parents having told her of that intention in Bangladesh in
   2007, and having married he had decided not to go back and get a spouse
   visa.

4. The Judge's findings are set out in from paragraph 11 of the decision.
   The Judge found that the Appellant had not sent the original
   documentation that had been requested. There was evidence of an Islamic
   marriage in August 2009 and a civil marriage in November 2011, the Judge
   accepted that the relationship was genuine and subsisting and that couple
   have 3 children. However, as the Appellant could not meet the eligibility
   requirements paragraph EX.1 did not apply having come to the UK on a
   visit visa.

5. The Judge went on to consider the Appellant's circumstances outside the
   Immigration Rules. at paragraph 16 the Judge the difference between the
   evidence of the Appellant and his wife and in paragraph 17 found that the
   fact he had come with the intention of settling in the UK cast serious
   doubt on his overall credibility. He had not been truthful on his visit
   visa application and his primary intention had been to avoid the normal
   entry clearance route as a spouse. In paragraph 18 the Judge rejected the
   claim that the Appellant could not return as his wife would not be able
   to cope and set out the evidence that suggested otherwise.

6. In the following paragraphs the Judge considered ZH (Tanzania), E-A
   (Nigeria) and Zoumbas before setting out section 117b of the 2002 Act and
   AM (S117B) Malawi [2015]UKUT 260 (IAC). Summarising the findings and
   conclusions in paragraph 27 the Judge found that the marriage was
   arranged and the marriage entered into when they knew he was an
   overstayer with no leave to remain and the family life was established in
   that context. The Appellant did not speak English and there was no
   evidence that he was financially independent, the Sponsor was on benefits
   in local authority accommodation. It was proportionate that the Appellant
   should return to Bangladesh and make an entry clearance application.

7. At the start of the hearing before hearing submissions I observed to the
   representatives that there was clear evidence of a breach of the visit
   visa and no evidence that the earnings threshold was met. For the
   Appellant it was submitted that an exception to the ï¿½18,600 requirement
   is where there is a genuine and subsisting parental relationship. I
   raised the question of the effect of the cases of Dereci and Sanade. Mr
   Mustafa referred to Treebhowen and section 117B (6) and said that there
   was hypothetical question to be answered and there was no finding of
   deception by the Judge. The Secretary of State could have refused the
   application on suitability grounds but had not done so. It was submitted
   that the reasoning in paragraph 12 of the decision was a material error.
   The Appellant met the requirements. The Appellant met the definition of a
   partner.


8. When the decision was made suitability had not been considered, there
   was no evidence of the relationship, evidence that should have been
   submitted with the application was missing despite the requests made. The
   Judge had doubted the credibility of the witnesses including with regard
   to the Appellant's ties to Bangladesh. The public interest had been
   considered. In paragraph 27 there were proportionality findings. It was
   submitted that the Appellant's immigration history could not be described
   as serious and the Judge had not addressed section 117B (6) referring
   also to Treebhowen. In SF the policy was considered. In conclusion it was
   suggested that the appeal should be allowed or remitted for rehearing.


9. As was to be expected the Home Office took the opposing position.
   Suitability had not been considered as there was no evidence to confirm
   the stated relationship and the marriage certificates had come late. The
   Appellant would fail under suitability. The Refusal Letter focussed on
   the partner route as did the decision, proportionality had been properly
   considered and not all the evidence had been accepted. The Judge had
   considered the evidence including his intention to stay and get married.
   There was no suggestion the children would have to leave they could
   remain with their mother. Chen applied, this was not an inadvertent error
   as he had done all he could to circumvent the rules, his presence being
   unlawful and precarious.


10. The Judge did err in respect of the eligibility requirements as the
   application was made after his visit visa had expired. However for the
   reasons that follow that error is not material. It appears from the way
   that the Home Office considered the case and then the manner in which the
   evidence came out at the hearing that the Home Office had no reason to
   consider the Appellant's suitability. The Appellant had failed to provide
   the required evidence to the Home Office to support the claim that he was
   in a relationship.


11. The evidence at the hearing clearly showed that the Appellant's coming
   to the UK was in order to get married and to circumvent the rules that
   apply to such arrangements. The Judge explicitly found that to be the
   case in paragraph 17 where he stated "I find that the fact that the
   appellant came to this country on a visit visa with the intention of
   settling in this country casts serious doubt on his overall credibility.
   I find that he was not truthful on his visit Visa Application Form by
   stating that he was visiting the UK for a limited period of time...I find
   that whilst he undoubtedly visited his sister it was his intention
   primarily to get married and to settle in this country without going
   through the normal entry clearance route as a spouse."


12. Those findings were clearly open to the Judge in the light of the
   evidence from the Appellant and in particular his spouse. That finding
   has not been challenged and given the evidence recorded it is difficult
   to see a basis on which a challenge could have been made. The Home Office
   in submissions rely on that finding as part of the argument to justify
   the decision made by the Judge.


13. Given the Appellant's deliberate evasion of immigration control and his
   having overstayed his visit visa it would follow that everything that he
   established after that time was when he was in the UK illegally. This was
   with the connivance of his partner who cannot complain about the effect
   of her part in that exercise by them and the subsequent diminution of her
   position. The Appellant's attempt to remain on an EEA basis had been
   rejected by First-tier Tribunal Judge Snape and no effort was made by the
   Appellant to comply with the obligation to leave at that time.


14. This is an area which has been considered by the Supreme Court in
   Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11 which included a review of ECtHR decisions. But
   for the exceptional circumstances identified in the case of Jeunesse it
   was concluded in the ECtHR that there were no insurmountable obstacles to
   family life continuing outside the EU and from paragraph 114 of the
   Jeunesse decision, cited in paragraph 54 of Agyarko removal in
   circumstances where the individual has been in the UK precariously [and
   in this case illegally] removal of the non-national would by incompatible
   with article 8 in exceptional circumstances. The circumstances in
   Jeunesse are a useful comparator.


15. The suggestion that the Appellant's deliberate evasion of immigration
   control should not be regarded as very serious cannot be maintained. Both
   the Appellant and his wife connived in the evasion of controls that they
   both knew applied to the Appellant in circumstances where it appears that
   the Appellant could not, and still does not meet the requirements. In
   addition he cannot speak English and is dependent on state benefits. His
   family could live in Bangladesh if they choose, it has to be remembered
   that the Appellant is not a victim of circumstances he is in a situation
   entirely of his own making.


16. Whilst the route that the Judge took may be open to question his
   findings that the Appellant's removal would be a proportionate response
   is beyond criticism. In the circumstances I am satisfied that the error
   in approach is not material. The unchallenged findings made in the
   decision, when compared with Agyarko or Jeunesse, more than justify the
   conclusion and in the circumstances I decline to interfere with a
   perfectly sustainable decision.

CONCLUSIONS

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the
making of a material error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and I make no
order.

Fee Award

In dismissing this appeal I make no fee award.
