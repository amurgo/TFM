                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the first claimant's appeal against
    the decision by the Secretary of State to refuse to grant him leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  The  claimant's  wife,  Mrs
    Sabina Sultana, joined in the appeal as his dependant.   As  the  first
    claimant is the main claimant in the appeal, I shall hereafter refer to
    him simply as the claimant save where the context  otherwise  requires.
    The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity order, and I  do  not
    consider that an anonymity order is warranted for these proceedings  in
    the Upper Tribunal.

 2. In his application, the claimant declared in  section  G  that  he  had
    access to not less than �50,000 and had previously held leave as a Tier
    1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant and was now registered as self-employed  or
    as a director, and was engaged in business activity and  occupation  at
    degree level.  He had not yet  invested  any  of  the  funds.   He  was
    relying  on  funds  held  overseas.   He  was  enclosing  a  letter  of
    permission from  the  third  party  funds  provider  and  a  letter  of
    confirmation from a legal advisor.  With  respect  to  the  funds  held
    overseas, he was relying on a letter from  each  financial  institution
    "holding your funds" confirming  the  amount  of  money  held  in  that
    institution, and confirming that it was regulated by the home regulator
    and that money was disposable in the UK.

 3. In section G10 he said he was relying on a letter from M&T Bank showing
    access to just over �26,000 and a letter  from  Cardinal  Bank  showing
    access to just over �28,000.

 4. On 10 June 2013 the Secretary of State gave her  reasons  for  refusing
    the application, and for making a decision to remove  the  claimant  by
    way of directions under Section  47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.  He stated he had  access  to  funds  of  �50,000
    being made available to his business by third party  funding  from  two
    third party funders.  As evidence of this he had provided a letter from
    Cardinal bank and M&T  Bank,  and  a  declaration  from  both  funders.
    However the bank letter was not acceptable because it did  not  confirm
    the institution was regulated by the appropriate  regulatory  body,  it
    did not state his name, nor did it confirm the amount  of  money  being
    made available to him, and it did not confirm that the money  could  be
    transferred to the UK.

 5. The third party declaration he had submitted was not acceptable because
    it did not contain both his signature and that of the third party.

 6. No declaration  from  a  legal  representative  had  been  supplied  to
    establish that the letter of permission supplied was valid, as required
    by paragraph 41-SD(b)(ii) of Appendix A of the Rules.

The Hearing before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 7. The claimant's appeal came before Judge Nightingale sitting  at  Hatton
    Cross on 14 January  2014.   Mr  Hossain  appeared  on  behalf  of  the
    claimant, and Mr Khan of Counsel appeared on behalf of the Secretary of
    State.  The claimant gave oral evidence, and explained that one of  his
    business partners, his uncle from the United States of America, had now
    sent the funds which he had offered to invest in  the  business.   This
    was a sum of �23,500.  His uncle had sent him this  money  in  December
    2013.  He showed the judge that he now had in a bank account in the  UK
    a sum just short of �52,000.  This was made up of  money  sent  by  his
    uncle in the United States, and the rest was savings accrued by himself
    and his wife from the employment  that  they  had  had  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

 8. The claimant explained that his uncle had sent the money  over  to  him
    after he had been refused leave to remain.   The  documents  which  his
    uncle had given him to send with the application were not in the format
    that the Home Office wanted.  His uncle had told him that his  bank  in
    the USA could not provide a letter in the format that the  Home  Office
    wanted.

 9. The claimant was importing clothes from Bangladesh and selling them  in
    the UK.  His role was to do sales and marketing for his  business.   He
    proposed to use the United Kingdom as the main base of operations,  and
    import garments from Bangladesh and send them on the United  States  of
    America and also to Africa.  He had now invested in his business as  he
    had ordered the garments referred to in the invoice at page 46.  He had
    already paid for some of the order.  If  he  was  not  granted  further
    leave to remain it would cost him financially.  He would  have  to  pay
    compensation to factories if he cancelled the orders,  and  that  would
    mean he would make a financial loss.

10. In his closing submissions on behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Khan
    submitted that the bank letter from Cardinal  Bank  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules.  The claimant had given evidence that it was
    not possible to get a letter from Cardinal Bank which complied with the
    Rules.  Therefore it would have made no difference if he had been asked
    to obtain such a document.  With regard to Article 8,  the  Rules  were
    sufficient to meet the Secretary of State's obligations.  The claimants
    did not meet the Rules.  If the claimant had chosen to invest a lot  of
    money without any insurance, that was a risk which he had to accept.

11. On behalf of  the  claimants,  Mr  Hossain  submitted  that  evidential
    flexibility should have been applied as there was  clearly  information
    missing which could have been provided.  The missing  information  such
    as the bank letter could have been  counteracted  very  easily  by  the
    sending of the money to the United Kingdom in the manner which had  now
    occurred.  If the claimant had known that the bank could not write  the
    letter in the format required, then the uncle could quite  simply  have
    sent the money directly to the claimant very quickly, and the  transfer
    could have been notified to  the  respondent  to  meet  an  alternative
    requirement of the Rules. Mr Hossain invited the judge to find that the
    claimant was engaged in a genuine business venture.

12. In her subsequent findings, the judge held that the  claimant  had  not
    complied with the Rules.  The documents which had been  submitted  were
    not in the correct  format  specified  within  the  Rules.   She  asked
    herself whether it would have made any difference if the  claimant  had
    been asked to deal with the shortcomings in  the  documentary  evidence
    which was submitted.  Had the claimant been aware of  the  shortcomings
    of the bank letter, it was quite clear that the money could  have  been
    forwarded to him and the Rule met in an alternative manner.  That being
    so, she could not find it would have made no difference if he had  been
    contacted by the Secretary of State and the shortcomings  of  the  bank
    letter pointed out to him.

13. As for the third party declaration, these shortcomings had  been  dealt
    with in a more recent declaration.  In any event, had the money been in
    the claimant's own account, a third party declaration would not in fact
    have been relevant to the application.

14. She was persuaded that addressing the omission or error might well have
    led to a grant of  leave  in  this  particular  case.   Certainly,  the
    Secretary of State had not explained how  addressing  the  omission  or
    error would not have led to a grant of leave or indeed upon what  other
    grounds the application would fail.  The claimant had  demonstrated  on
    balance that he may well have been able to address the omissions had he
    been given the opportunity in accordance with paragraph  245AA  of  the
    Rules and in accordance with the Secretary  of  State's  own  published
    policy.  That being so, she was bound to find  that  the  Secretary  of
    State had not given any consideration to her own published  policy  and
    consequently the decision was not in accordance with the law.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

15. On 7 February  2014  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Cheales  granted  the
    Secretary of State permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         It is arguable that the Secretary of State was not to know that the
         claimant had funds available and more information to show  business
         activity.  The evidential flexibility policy does not  require  the
         Secretary of State in every case where there was a failure to  meet
         the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  to   make   further
         enquiries.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

16. At the hearing in the Upper Tribunal I received  submissions  from  the
    parties to whether the decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an
    error of law.  I found that the decision did contain an error  of  law,
    and should be set aside.  My reasons for so finding are set out below.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

17. This application was governed by Paragraph 245AA, which was  introduced
    in the autumn  of  2012  and  was  expressly  designed  to  codify  the
    Secretary of State's evidential  flexibility  policy.  Under  paragraph
    245AA, the UK Border Agency/Home  Office  will  not  request  documents
    where a specified document has not been submitted.  This  Rule  was  in
    force at the date of application, and it also was in force at the  date
    of decision.

18. The Secretary of  State  continues  to  publish  internal  guidance  to
    caseworkers on evidential flexibility, but this guidance does not  give
    applicants any relief that is not contained in paragraph 245AA.

19. The current Home Office guidance on  evidential  flexibility  is  valid
    from 7 November 2013. The introduction to the latest guidance which  is
    directed to caseworkers, provides as follows:

         This guidance tells you about the  use  of  evidential  flexibility
         when an application has missing evidence or there is a minor  error
         on an application.

         This guidance puts together cross-cutting guidance which previously
         existed in separate products,  and  combines  relevant  information
         from other operational instructions.  It  supersedes  all  previous
         instructions and guidance on evidential flexibility.

         Under the evidential flexibility process, if there are minor errors
         or  omissions  on  specified  documents  submitted  with  a   valid
         application but there is enough evidence to  show  the  application
         would otherwise be granted, you may contact the migrant, sponsor or
         representative as  appropriate  for  clarification  or  to  request
         missing documents and/or information.

         For applications made on or after 13 December 2012 you can accept a
         specified document which is:

         .    in the wrong format, or

         .    a copy of an original document

         If you are satisfied it is genuine  the  applicant  meets  all  the
         other requirements of the Immigration Rules.  You do  not  have  to
         write out in these circumstances.

         However, the Home Office reserves a right to  request  a  specified
         original  document  in  the  correct  format  in  all  cases  where
         paragraph 245AA(b) applies, and to  refuse  applications  if  these
         documents are not provided as set out in this paragraph.

         All documentary evidence must be treated in the  same  way  as  any
         submitted with the initial application.

         For applications decided in or after  1  October  2013  further  to
         amendments made on 13 December 2012  under  evidential  flexibility
         you do not have to write to an applicant about a specified document
         if it does not contain all of the specified information  where  you
         can get the missing information from:

         .    other documents submitted with the application

         .    the website of the organisation which issued the document, or

         .    the website of the appropriate regulatory body

20. With respect to the policy guidance introduced in June 2011 (which  was
    superseded by paragraph 245AA - see above), Davis LJ said as follows in
    paragraph [92] of Rodriguez in the Court of Appeal:

         In this regard it is  quite  true  that  the  introduction  to  the
         process instruction flagged up  two  significant  changes,  one  of
         which was that 'there is no limit to the amount of information that
         can be requested from the applicant'.  It is to be noted that  this
         is immediately qualified  by  the  instruction  that  requests  for
         information  should  not  be  speculative  and  -  as  subsequently
         reiterated - there must be sufficient reasons to believe  that  any
         evidence requested existed.  The same point is made in  step  3  of
         the procedure  table  -  taking  the  example  of  bank  statements
         (specified documents), the example given is that of bank statements
         missing from a series; see also what is said in this  regard  under
         the heading 'maintenance' at page 10  of  the  instruction.   Taken
         overall,  the  evidential  flexibility   process   instruction   is
         demonstrably not designed to  give  an  applicant  the  opportunity
         first to remedy any defect or  inadequacy  in  the  application  or
         supporting documentation so as to save the application from refusal
         after substantive consideration.

21. In this appeal the judge took into  account  the  additional  documents
    provided by way of appeal, and pondered whether the claimant would have
    been able to  provide  these  additional  documents  in  support  of  a
    continuing application if the  errors  or  omissions  in  the  original
    documentation had been  pointed  out  to  him.   Having  answered  this
    question in the affirmative, the judge leapt to the conclusion that the
    Secretary of State must have acted in breach of paragraph 245AA of  the
    Rules and/or her published policy on evidential flexibility.

22. The judge's approach was fundamentally flawed.  Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department  v  Rodriguez  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  2  had  not  been
    published by the date of the hearing. But the law always  speaks.   The
    judge had to place herself in the shoes of a caseworker  assessing  the
    application on the documents that had been provided. She was  wrong  to
    apply  hindsight  to  determine  the  question  of  whether  evidential
    flexibility policy principles had been breached. She was also wrong  to
    take into account additional information and  documents  that  had  not
    been before the caseworker assessing the application.

23. Another fallacy in  the  judge's  approach  was  the  presumption  that
    because the evidential flexibility policy was not referred  to  in  the
    refusal letter, it should be taken that the Secretary of State has  not
    applied it or considered whether it should be applied.

24. The claimant clearly did not provide all  the  specified  documents  in
    table 4 and paragraph 41, as required by paragraph  41-SD.   Under  41-
    SD(a)(i), the claimant had to provide  a  letter  from  each  financial
    institution holding the funds, to confirm the amount of money available
    to the appellant.  Each letter had, inter  alia,  to  comply  with  the
    following requirements:

    ...

    (4)  have been produced within the three months immediately before  the
         date of your application,

    ...

    (8)  confirm the amount of money available  from  the  applicant's  own
         funds (if applicable) that are held in that institution,

    (9)  confirm the amount of money provided to  the  applicant  from  any
         third party (if applicable) that is held in that institution

25. Paragraph 41-SD(b) also contains further specific requirements relating
    to third party funding.  The specified documents that must be  provided
    include:

    (i)  an original declaration from every third party they have made  the
         money available for the applicant to invest in a  business  in  the
         United Kingdom, containing, among other things:

         (3)  the applicant's signature and the signature of the third party
             ...; and

    (ii)     a letter from a legal representative confirming  the  validity
         of signatures on  each  third  party  declaration  provided,  which
         confirms  that  the  declarations  from  the  third   party/parties
         contains the signatures of the people stated.  It can be  a  single
         letter covering all third party  permissions,  or  several  letters
         from several legal representatives.  It must be an original  letter
         and not a  copy,  and  it  must  be  from  a  legal  representative
         permitted to practise in the country where the third party  or  the
         money is.

26. On the claimant's own evidence, the  bank  letter  from  Cardinal  Bank
    deliberately did not confirm that the amount in the third party's  bank
    account was available to him. It follows that there is no scope for the
    application of evidential flexibility principles.  This is not  a  case
    where the claimant had accidentally omitted some information.   He  was
    simply unable to obtain a bank letter from Cardinal Bank which complied
    with the requirements of the Rules, and he could  not  cure  this  non-
    compliance.  As previously noted, the bank letter has  to  be  produced
    "within  the  three  months  immediately  before  the  date   of   your
    application".   The  claimant  was  faced  by  an   historic   timeline
    constraint.  Once he had made his application, he could not rely  on  a
    new bank letter which post-dated the date of application. Similarly, he
    could not rely on an alternative  method  of  demonstrating  access  to
    funds. For the same historic time line constraint applies to funds held
    by an applicant in his own bank account. The funds  have  to  be  there
    before the application is made.  So there was no obligation on the part
    of the caseworker to point out to the claimant  that  the  bank  letter
    from Cardinal Bank was deficient,  before  making  a  decision  on  his
    application.

The Re-making of the Decision

27. It follows that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal should  be  set
    aside, and that the claimant's appeal against the refusal of  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant should be dismissed.  As  the
    Section 47 removal decision was made after 8 May 2013,  it  is  lawful.
    The only issue which remains unresolved is  the  claimant's  Article  8
    claim which the judge did not consider as she had allowed the appeal on
    another basis.

28. Mr Hossain invited me to take account of  the  evidence  given  by  the
    claimant in his witness statement for the  hearing  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  He was granted leave  to  enter  the  United  Kingdom  as  a
    student in July 2007, and his last leave to remain was  extended  as  a
    Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant until 3 March 2013.  His wife had been
    granted leave to enter the United Kingdom on 1  April  2012  as  a  PBS
    dependant.  Whilst being  in  the  United  Kingdom,  the  claimant  had
    successfully completed his master of science degree from the University
    of Greenwich.

29. The claimant says he is a law-abiding migrant who  has  never  breached
    immigration law during his stay in the UK.   He  is  deeply  integrated
    with British culture and society.  His private  life  has  been  formed
    through his study and work.  The required funds are available  to  him,
    and he is keen to continue with his business so as to build his career.
     If he has to leave the UK, then his career will be adversely affected.

30. In his closing submissions on behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State,  Mr
    Melvin submitted that the Article 8 claim should be  dismissed,  citing
    Gulshan.  In reply, Mr Hossain acknowledged  that  the  claimant  could
    make a fresh  application  relying  on  new  specified  documents.   He
    submitted that it would be quite difficult  for  the  claimant  to  get
    together the required  documents  within  28  days,  and  the  proposed
    interference with private life was disproportionate.

31. In Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013]  UKUT  640
    the Upper Tribunal held that after applying  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules, only if there may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to
    remain outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on  to
    consider whether there are compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently
    recognised under them.  In the absence of insurmountable obstacles,  it
    is  necessary  to  show  other  non-standard  and  particular  features
    demonstrating that removal will be unjustifiably harsh.

32.  There  are  plainly  not  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family   life
    continuing in the claimant's home country of Bangladesh, as  they  will
    be returning there together.  It is also not suggested that  either  of
    the claimants has a viable private life claim under paragraph 276ADE of
    the Rules.  The first claimant is still some way  short  of  qualifying
    for leave to remain on the grounds of ten years' lawful residence,  and
    neither he nor his wife has severed ties with Bangladesh.

33. On the evidence before me, there are  not  arguably  good  grounds  for
    granting leave to remain outside the Rules,  and  therefore  I  do  not
    consider it is necessary for Article 8 purposes to go  on  to  consider
    whether there are compelling circumstances not sufficiently  recognised
    under them.  There are no non-standard and particular features in  this
    case demonstrating that removal would be  unjustifiably  harsh.   I  am
    reinforced in this finding by the fact that it is open to the  claimant
    to make a fresh application.  Provided he  makes  a  fresh  application
    within 28 days of the date when his appeal  rights  are  deemed  to  be
    exhausted, he will not thereafter be treated as an  overstayer.   Since
    his case before the First-tier Tribunal was that  he  is  now  able  to
    provide all the correct specified documents, it is reasonable to expect
    the claimant to make a fresh application within 28 days, if so advised.







Decision

34. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of law,  and
    accordingly the decision is set aside and  the  following  decision  is
    substituted: the claimants' appeals against the  refusal  of  leave  to
    remain are dismissed under the Rules and under Article 8 ECHR.
