                                                                    Claimant

Representation:

For the claimant: Ms R Head, instructed by Lawrence Lupin Solicitors
For the appellant:     Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is his appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge  Dhanji  promulgated  19.11.15,  allowing  on
    asylum grounds the  claimant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State, dated 13.5.15, to refuse his  asylum,  humanitarian
    protection and human rights claims.  The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    27.10.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge McCarthy  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    15.12.15. However  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede granted permission to  appeal  on
    12.1.16.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 1.3.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. At the hearing before me I found no error of law in the making  of  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal sufficient to require the  decision
    of Judge Dhanji to be set aside. I gave my  decision  at  the  hearing,
    reserving my reasons, which I now give.

 5. The relevant background can  be  briefly  summarised  as  follows.  The
    appellant, a citizen of Afghanistan, claimed arrival arrived in the  UK
    in 2010, refused in 2014. His appeal against refusal was  dismissed  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Scott in May 2014. That judge found  credible
    his claim to have been targeted by and at risk from  the  Taliban,  but
    considered that he could relocate to Kabul,  where  there  would  be  a
    sufficiency of protection, and that it was not unreasonable  to  expect
    him to do so.

 6. Further submissions by the appellant that internal relocation was not a
    viable option, relying on  the  expert  report  of  Dr  Giustozzi,  was
    treated as a fresh claim, resulting in the refusal decision of 13.5.15,
    giving rise to the appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal  heard  by  Judge
    Dhanji on 27.10.15.

 7. The grounds of application for permission to  appeal  assert  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge failed to give adequate reasons  for  finding
    that it would not be reasonable to expect  the  appellant  to  relocate
    within Afghanistan and failed to have regard to the  country  guideline
    decision of AK (Article 15(c)) Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 163 (IAC) and
    failed to give sufficient reasons to  depart  from  that  guidance.  In
    particular, reliance is placed on the statement in AK that in assessing
    whether internal relocation to Kabul is a viable  alternative,  "it  is
    necessary  to  take  into  account  (both  in  assessing  'safety'  and
    'reasonableness') not only the level of violence in that city but  also
    the difficulties experienced by that city's  poor  and  also  the  many
    Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) living there, these  considerations
    will not in general make return to Kabul unsafe or unreasonable."

 8. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Kebede found arguable merit  in
    the assertion that in concluding that  it  would  be  unduly  harsh  to
    expect the claimant to relocate to  Kabul  the  judge's  reasoning  for
    departing from the country guidance of AK was insufficient.

 9. However, it is clear from a reading of the decision from �8 onwards and
    in particular �8.5 that the judge was fully aware of the binding effect
    of the country guidance in AK. The judge noted that the Upper  Tribunal
    stressed that  it  would  still  always  be  necessary  to  examine  an
    applicant's individual circumstances. At �8.7, the judge noted  that  a
    country guidance case must be treated  as  authority  on  the  relevant
    issue where a subsequent appeal relates to that issue  and  depends  on
    the same or similar evidence. The judge very carefully  set  out,  "The
    question, therefore, when assessing the evidence referred to above,  is
    whether it justifies a departure from the country guidance case, on the
    basis, as has been argued by the appellant, that the country  situation
    has materially deteriorated since that decision and since the  evidence
    the evidence considered by the Upper Tribunal in that case."

10. It is also relevant to note that this is not an article 15(c) case, but
    turned rather on whether, pursuant to Januzi v SSHD [2006] UKHL 5,  the
    appellant could show that it would be unduly harsh  to  expect  him  to
    relocate to Kabul in all the circumstances, the issue identified by the
    judge at �8.9 and from which Mr Nath did not demur.

11. It is clear the judge not only took into account the expert  report  of
    Dr Giustozzi, but noted that there was further evidence not before  the
    Tribunal in AK, and went on to summarise that evidence in some detail.

12. At �8.17 the judge the judge noted that he had not been "pointed in any
    specific way to what precisely the appellant says has changed since the
    evidence considered by  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  AK,"  but  continued,
    "However, I am satisfied from the country evidence before me including,
    but not limited to the evidence I have referred to  above,  that  there
    has been a significant deterioration in the situation  in  Kabul  since
    AK, and that it is extremely difficult for those who are returned there
    and who do not have close family  ties,  accommodation  and  employment
    opportunities to sustain themselves. The appellant is such  a  person."
    The judge went on to explain why the claimant would  be  in  particular
    difficulties on return or relocation to Kabul. In conclusion, the judge
    "found, in short, that expecting the appellant to relocate would not be
    reasonable. Applying the principles in Januzi,  I  find  that  internal
    relocation to Kabul, for the appellant, would be unduly harsh."

13. A reading of the decision in its entirety makes clear  that  the  judge
    has justified departure from AK. A different judge  may  have  taken  a
    different view of the country background  evidence  presented  and  may
    have found no basis to depart from AK, but it cannot be said that Judge
    Dhanji failed to correctly identify the law and the issues,  or  failed
    to provide a careful assessment of the evidence, or failed  to  provide
    cogent  reasons  for  departing  from  the  country  guidance  on   the
    particular circumstances of this  appellant.  The  conclusions  reached
    were entirely open to the judge and  fully  justified  by  the  reasons
    given. In the circumstances I find no error of law in this decision.

Conclusions:

14. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains allowed on asylum grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal made an order.
Given the circumstances, I continue that anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus no fee award can be made
