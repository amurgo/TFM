Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Spence, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Mr B Marshall, Barry Clark, Solicitor


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The respondent, Sara Farahkordmahaleh, was born on 31 August  1979  and
    is a female citizen of Iran.  I shall hereafter refer to the respondent
    as "the appellant" as she was before the First-tier Tribunal;  I  shall
    refer to the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  as  the
    "respondent".  The appellant had appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    against a decision of the respondent to refuse her leave to  enter  the
    United Kingdom as the spouse of a British citizen under Appendix FM  of
    the Immigration Rules. The respondent considered that  the  appellant's
    spouse did not have the required annual income of �18,600.  The  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge (Judge  Thorne)  dismissed  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules but allowed it under Article 8 ECHR.   At  [31],  the
    judge wrote that he was

         not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that at the  time  of
         the ECO's decision the appellant had a gross annual  income  of  at
         least �18,600 from specified employment in the UK.  The evidence is
         clear that at the material time the  business  of  the  appellant's
         husband had an operating profit after expenses of only �1,528.

 2. The appellant had entered the United Kingdom in  September  2005  as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Student.  She had valid leave until  18  October  2012
    and had applied, whilst in country, to vary her leave to remain as  the
    spouse of a British citizen.  The parties agreed that the appellant and
    her spouse enjoyed a family life in the United  Kingdom  and  that  the
    relationship was genuine.  As the judge properly identified, the  issue
    under Article 8 ECHR was one of proportionality.  At  [59],  the  judge
    found, having set out the various factors in favour of  the  respondent
    and the appellant, that "the human rights of  the  appellant  (and  her
    husband) are not outweighed by the public interest [concerned with  her
    removal]".  The judge noted that there was no embassy in Iran at  which
    the appellant might make  an  out  of  country  application  for  entry
    clearance.  If the appellant's spouse accompanied her to Iran then  the
    new business which he had built up in the United Kingdom would founder.
     The judge also noted that:

         There was no dispute that at the time of the hearing the  appellant
         would meet the financial requirements of the Rules as her husband's
         business gave him an operating  profit  of  over  �20,000  a  year.
         Therefore the husband is now in a position to support and  maintain
         the appellant in the UK without recourse to public funds.

 3. The grounds of appeal assert that "for a case to succeed on  Article  8
    grounds outside  the  Rules  it  is  necessary  for  that  case  to  be
    exceptional".  Replying to the grant of permission under Rule  24,  the
    appellant relies upon Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40.

 4. I have considered both the oral and the written submissions  carefully.
    I do not find that the judge has erred in law.   There  is  no  general
    test of "exceptionality" for the application of Article 8 ECHR  outside
    the ambit of the Immigration Rules.  A judge has adopted a  proper  and
    structured approach to the  appeal  on  Article  8  grounds,  helpfully
    setting out at [57 - 58] the various factors in favour of each party in
    the appeal.  In light  of  the  fact  that  the  Secretary  of  State's
    Presenting Officer appears to have accepted at the First-tier  Tribunal
    hearing that an out of country application under paragraph  281  of  HC
    395 would  now  succeed,  the  judge  properly  applied  the  ratio  of
    Chikwamba.  His decision to allow the appeal  was  clearly  a  decision
    open to him on the evidence and by way of a proper application  of  the
    jurisprudence. I can identify no reason for me to interfere with it. In
    the circumstances, the appeal is dismissed.

DECISION

 5. This appeal is dismissed.
