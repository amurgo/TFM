                               HUMAIRA BARKET
                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Timson, instructed by Juris Solicitors Ltd


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. I shall refer to the appellant as the respondent, and the respondent as
    the appellant (as they  appeared  respectively  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal).  The appellant, Humaira Barket, was born on 1 April 1985 and
    is a female citizen of Pakistan.  She appealed against  a  decision  of
    the Secretary of State dated 15 December 2017  refusing  her  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom under Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE  of
    HC 395 (as amended) and Article 8 ECHR.  The First-tier Tribunal  in  a
    decision promulgated on 14 August 2018  allowed  the  appeal  on  human
    rights grounds.  The Secretary of State now appeals,  with  permission,
    to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. Helpfully, Mr A McVeety, who appeared for the Secretary of State,  told
    me that he would make no submissions with a view to persuading me  that
    the First-tier Tribunal erred in law.  The first ground concerning  the
    failure of the judge to make  a  finding  in  respect  of  the  alleged
    deception of the appellant, fell  away  in  the  light  of  the  recent
    judgment of the Supreme Court in  KO  (Nigeria)  [2018]  UKSC  53.   As
    regards the second ground concerning the reasonableness  of  a  British
    child leaving the United Kingdom, Mr McVeety  conceded  that  the  Home
    Office's own policy did not require such a course of action.

 3. In the circumstances, this appeal is dismissed.
