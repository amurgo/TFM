For the Appellant:     Ms N Hashimi
For the Respondent:    Ms A Holmes, HOPO


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of India born on 2 September 1985.   He  has
    been granted permission to appeal the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Burnett  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent made on 27 February 2013 refusing his application for  leave
    to remain in the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.

2.   The appellant made an application on 1 April 2011 with a  CAS  assigned
    by London Business Academy.  However, when  the  register  was  checked
    this organisation was not listed.  The appellant was therefore  sent  a
    letter by UKBA dated 27 July 2012 allowing him 60 days to obtain a  new
    CAS and submit an application to vary.

3.   On 21 September 2012 the appellant submitted an  application  to  study
    CIMA at Westbridge College but provided a conditional offer letter  not
    a CAS.  On 19 December 2012 a letter was sent by UKBA requesting up-to-
    date English test results and bank statements.  On 17 January 2013  the
    UKBA received up-to-date bank statements  but  no  TOEIC  results  were
    received.

4.   The appellant appealed the respondent's decision and asserted  that  he
    in fact received the letter from UKBA on 3 September 2012.  He said  he
    provided a Royal Mail recorded receipt to demonstrate this.  He further
    stated that he did not get 60 days to submit a new CAS.   He  explained
    that he had difficulties taking  and  completing  an  English  language
    test.  He had booked an exam for 15 and 19 March 2013.

5.   He provided his TOEIC test results,  a  letter  from  Premier  Language
    Training Centre dated 2 April 2013, a track  and  trace  printout  from
    Royal Mail, a copy of an envelope with his name  on  it  and  documents
    from Canara Bank.  He provided a  further  letter  to  his  grounds  of
    appeal stating that he has been unable to obtain a CAS because  he  had
    no valid leave and a  pending  appeal.   He  provided  bank  statements
    covering the last 28 days proving he has the maintenance required.

6.   The appellant's appeal was determined on the  papers  as  requested  by
    the appellant.

7.   The judge stated that he had been provided  by  the  appellant  with  a
    proof of posting for an item sent by recorded delivery.  The address on
    the copy envelope was an avenue in Wembley.  He noted that  the  letter
    said to be sent by UKBA to the appellant was dated 27  July  2012,  and
    the address at the top  of  the  letter  was  a  different  address  in
    Wembley.  The appellant has not explained or provided any proof of when
    he changed address, or when he notified UKBA of this change of address.

8.   The judge said that the appellant was given  60  days  to  find  a  new
    college and submit a new CAS and application.  The letter was dated  27
    July.  However, the appellant  states  he  received  the  letter  on  3
    September  2012.   The  respondent  did  not  check  and   refuse   his
    application until 27 February 2013.  60 days from 3 September 2012 is 2
    November 2012.  The application was not decided until 27 February 2013.
     The judge found that the appellant in  fact  had  177  days  from  the
    claimed receipt of the letter from UKBA.

9.   He also noted that the appellant made an application according to  UKBA
    on 21 September to vary his leave with  a  new  sponsor,  but  did  not
    obtain a CAS.  The appellant has not explained why,  and  no  documents
    have been provided by him, to evidence why a CAS was not obtained.  The
    judge found in the circumstances  that  the  appellant  had  had  ample
    opportunity to submit a new application, even taking the starting  date
    from the date he provided as to when he received the letter.

10.  The judge refused the appellant's appeal under Article 8 of  the  ECHR.
    He found that the respondent's decision to remove the  appellant  under
    Section 47 was unlawful.

11.   Permission  was  granted  to  the  appellant  on  the  basis  of   his
    submissions that the letter dated 27 July 2012 which was  sent  to  him
    giving him 60 days specified an expiry date of 25 September, so that he
    was not able to do all that was required during that time  in  relation
    to  the  English  language  test  requirements  and   the   maintenance
    requirements and that if an appellant did not have these  requirements,
    then no college was in a position to issue him with  a  CAS,  which  is
    what transpired.  Once he went past 25 September no college would issue
    him with a CAS.

12.  For the hearing today  the  appellant  submitted  a  witness  statement
    dated 11 October 2013.  He stated at paragraph 3  that  he  received  a
    letter  from  the  Home  Office  on  3  September  2012  to  submit  an
    application to vary the grounds of his original  application  and  that
    the deadline to submit his  application  was  25  September  2012.   He
    confirmed that he had submitted an application on  21  September  2012,
    but without  maintenance,  English  results  and  CAS  as  it  was  not
    practically possible for him to prepare and appear for an English test,
    maintain the money for 28 days in 21 days, and get a CAS  from  a  Home
    Office Tier 4 approved college.

13.  In paragraph 4 he stated that he changed his address in June  2012  and
    called the Home Office helpline to update his  address.   However,  the
    Home Office again sent the 60 days letter to his  previous  address  by
    recorded delivery, which was returned back to the Home Office as he was
    no longer living there.  Some time in August, he  called  his  landlord
    and asked him if there was any post for him as he was  worried  because
    he had not received any communication from the  Home  Office  for  more
    than fifteen months.  The landlord informed  him  that  there  was  one
    recorded delivery for him which was sent back to the Home Office as  he
    was no longer living at the address.  He immediately  called  the  Home
    Office helpline and they confirmed that they had sent a parcel  to  his
    previous address and it was returned back to them.   He  requested  the
    Home Office to send it back to him at his new address, and it was after
    that he received the letter dated 27 July 2012 on 3 September 2012.

14.  In paragraph 5 he said that he booked an English test  on  5  September
    2012 and appeared for the test without his  original  passport  as  his
    passport was with the Home Office.  The test centre would not allow him
    to appear for the English test without the original passport.  However,
    upon showing them the Home  Office-attested  copies  of  his  passport,
    Synergy Business College allowed him to appear for the  test,  but  did
    not give him his results despite contacting them on many occasions.  As
    a result he decided to retake the English exam on 9 January  2013,  but
    he was not allowed to retake it  without  his  original  passport.   He
    managed to book for his test again on 19 March  2013,  and  after  many
    requests and verifications he finally was able to  take  the  test  and
    achieve the required B2 level.

15.  He stated that he received two letters from the  Home  Office  dated  5
    November 2012 and 19  December  2012  requesting  him  to  provide  the
    original documents to consider his application,  but  unfortunately  it
    was not possible to provide the  documents  as  he  did  not  have  the
    English language results and there was no letter from the  Home  Office
    giving him permission to vary his application to show to the college to
    enable them to issue him with a CAS.  He said that the Home Office  has
    failed to give him 60 days as per the policy to  vary  his  application
    for leave to remain and instead give him 22 days to vary his  leave  to
    remain, which in itself was not compliant with the law.

16.  At the hearing, I gave Ms Holmes an opportunity  to  contact  the  Home
    Office to find out whether the Home Office received notification of the
    appellant's change of address, and when.  She returned with a  schedule
    which showed the following: between 11 April 2011 and 11  August  2011,
    their records showed that the appellant was living  at  92  Wyld  Lane,
    Wembley.  From 11 August 2011 to 30 August 2012 he  was  living  at  37
    Mostyn Avenue, Wembley.  From 30 August 2012  the  appellant's  address
    has been 25 Nettleden Avenue, Wembley.

17.  Ms Holmes said the letter dated 27 July 2012  was  sent  to  37  Mostyn
    Avenue a few times and the records showed that on  2,  15,  16  and  28
    August the letter was returned to  the  Home  Office  on  those  dates,
    stating that the appellant was not known at the address.

18.  Ms Holmes also confirmed what Ms Hashimi had said,  and  it  was  this:
    that the 60 day period expiring on 25  September  2012  was  maintained
    when the letter was finally received by the appellant on  30  September
    2012.  In fact it was the same letter dated 27 July 2012 that was  sent
    to the appellant at his current address.

19.  I accept Ms  Hashimi's  submission  that  the  appellant  informed  the
    respondent  of  his  change  of  address  via  the   UKBA   change   of
    address/representative website.  That was the same method  he  used  to
    inform the respondent when he moved from 92  Wyld  Lane  to  37  Mostyn
    Avenue.

20.  What concerns me most is the fact that the  respondent  did  not  alter
    the expiry date of the 60 period when they resent the letter of 27 July
    2012 to the appellant, which he received  on  3  September  2012.   The
    respondent should have been aware that the  appellant  would  have  had
    only 22 days to comply with the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules
    in respect of his Tier 4 application.  By  not  extending  the  60  day
    period, the appellant was put in a very  difficult  position  and  that
    meant that he could not comply with the requirements of the Immigration
    Rules.  I find in the  circumstances  that  the  respondent  had  acted
    unfairly towards the appellant.

21.  I find that the judge erred in law when he  found  that  the  appellant
    had 177 days from the claimed receipt of the letter from  UKBA  because
    the application was not decided until 27 February 2013.  In this case I
    find that the crucial date was not the date the respondent decided  the
    application but the variation of the expiry date of the 60  days.    As
    the expiry date was not varied, the appellant had  22  days  which  was
    insufficient to enable him to do all that he  was  required  to  do  in
    order to comply with the Immigration Rules.

22.  I find that the judge's decision cannot stand.

23.  I allow the appellant's appeal to the extent that  it  is  remitted  to
    the respondent to resolve this matter.
