                                    ORDER

1.   This Notice replaces the Notice of Judge Gill dated 10 July 2017.

2.   The appellant had an  outstanding  appeal  before  the  Upper  Tribunal
    (DA/00403/2015 and OA/07551/2015).

3.   By  a  letter  dated  31  October  2017  the  respondent  informed  the
    appellant's representative that  she  had  certified  the  decision  to
    refuse the appellant admission to the United Kingdom on 3 May 2015  and
    to deport him from the United Kingdom on 5 August 2015 under Regulation
    38(4)(c) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.

4.   As a consequence, the appellant's appeal in the Upper  Tribunal  lapses
    in accordance with Regulation 38(6) of the EEA Regulations.
