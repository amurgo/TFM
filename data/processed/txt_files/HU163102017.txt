For the Appellant:     Mr Z Sharma (counsel for Pasha Law Chambers
Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr Tufan (Home Office Specialist Appeals Team)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of Jigneshkumar [P], a citizen  of  India  born  [~]
    1984, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  of  4  September
    2018 dismissing his appeal, itself brought the refusal (of 20  November
    2017) of his human rights claim.

 2. The immigration history supplied by the Respondent sets  out  that  the
    Appellant entered the UK on 27 October 2006 as  a  student  with  leave
    that was ultimately extended until 31 December 2010; an application  of
    that date was refused, on 11 May 2012, and  on  27  December  2013  the
    Appellant was subsequently granted leave to remain until 30  May  2015.
    On 23 October 2014 he was served with notice of removability for having
    obtained his leave by deception. On 2 May 2015 he applied for leave  to
    remain on private and family life grounds, though the  application  was
    rejected as invalid for want of a passport on  13  August  2015;  on  9
    September 2015 he re-applied, and the  application  was  refused  on  7
    December 2015. He exercised his right of appeal,  though  the  December
    2015 decision was withdrawn on 9 March  2017  for  his  September  2015
    application to be reconsidered. This led to the November 2017  decision
    against which the present appeal lies.

 3. The Appellant's application was predicated on his length  of  residence
    in the UK combined with his relationship with Ms [P], his partner,  and
    her son who had entered the UK  in  June  2008  (to  whom  he  was  now
    stepfather); they had had a daughter together, born [~] 2011. Ms  [P]'s
    former husband had died in February 2014, and she and the Appellant had
    begun living together in April 2014.

 4. The application  was  refused  because  the  Respondent  suspected  the
    Appellant had submitted falsely obtained English language test  results
    in July 2012, because he had not cohabited with his partner for 2 years
    at the application date, and as he and his partner had not demonstrated
    that they would face  insurmountable  obstacles  to  life  together  in
    India. At an earlier hearing, the Tribunal had required  the  Secretary
    of State to provide clearer reasons for refusal,  and  further  reasons
    were subsequently provided, now explaining that the requirements of the
    10-year long residence route were not considered to have been  met  due
    to a gap in the Appellant's leave from 12 May 2012  until  27  December
    2013, and additionally because in any event the notice of removal of 23
    October 2014 automatically  curtailed  his  leave.  The  other  refusal
    reasons were maintained.

 5. Before the Tribunal the Appellant  gave  evidence  on  various  issues,
    including  the  circumstances  behind  his  May  2015  application.  He
    explained that the Home Office had not returned  his  passport  to  his
    former Solicitors; he had contacted them and they had  confirmed  this.
    Given he was not represented at the  time  he  made  this  application,
    there should not have been any prospect of correspondence or  documents
    being returned to any representative.

 6.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  noted  that  the  ostensible  gap  in   the
    Appellant's leave from  May  2012  until  December  2013  had  in  fact
    followed a refusal which had been withdrawn following the settlement of
    judicial  review  proceedings  on  that  basis.  Accordingly  his  last
    application, of December 2010, had in truth remained extant  over  that
    period; any other approach would fail to give effect to  the  terms  on
    which the judicial review application was settled. As  to  the  October
    2014 notice of the curtailment decision,  there  were  concerns  as  to
    whether it had been notified to the Appellant. Notably the copy in  the
    Respondent's  bundle  was  unsigned,  surprisingly  for  a  significant
    document, the subsequent decisions had not referred to  it,  and  other
    refusal letters were inconsistent as to whether the Appellant satisfied
    the Suitability criteria of the relevant route or not; on balance,  the
    Judge did not accept that the removal notice had  been  served  on  the
    Appellant. Thus the Tribunal considered  the  Appellant  to  have  been
    present lawfully until August 2015, when his application  was  returned
    to him as invalid.

 7. Moving on to the English language test fraud allegation, the First-tier
    Tribunal accepted that the Home Office had satisfied the initial burden
    necessary to raise the issue via the generic material they had provided
    in relation to the information received from  the  testing  body,  ETS,
    plus the Project Fa�ade  document  relating  to  Synergy  College.  The
    Appellant's evidence regarding the test day was vague and inconsistent,
    and there was no other evidence to assist him, such as prior successful
    English test results. Accordingly he had not  provided  a  sufficiently
    cogent explanation to rebut the  Secretary  of  State's  concerns,  the
    latter having accordingly satisfied the ultimate burden of proof on him
    to make good his dishonesty allegation.

 8. However, the Appellant had been subsequently granted leave, it  had  to
    be assumed, given the occasional reference to the ETS fraud  allegation
    in subsequent decision making, in the Respondent's  full  knowledge  of
    that aspect of his history. Although providing fraudulent test  results
    was a serious matter, given the convoluted history  of  the  case,  the
    Tribunal considered it appropriate to treat his case on the basis  that
    he satisfied  the  Suitability  requirements.  As  to  the  Eligibility
    requirements of Appendix FM's partner route, the Appellant  was  not  a
    partner given the lack  of  sufficient  cohabitation  at  the  date  of
    application, and there was no qualifying child in the family unit,  his
    stepson having in any event become an adult by  now.  His  relationship
    with Ms [P] had now ended. She appeared to hold limited leave, and  had
    no expectation of remaining in the UK on a long-term basis.  There  was
    no evidence suggesting he had any ongoing family life with Ms [P];  she
    had produced a brief witness  statement,  though  did  not  attend  the
    hearing. He might well have family life  with  their  daughter,  though
    there was no evidence of its depth, strength and regularity, and indeed
    even the daughter's immigration  status  was  unclear,  there  being  a
    reference to an appeal having been allowed and the consequent grant  of
    leave being pending.  It had to be  assumed  that  her  best  interests
    would be to remain with her mother, her primary carer.

 9. In conclusion, although the best interests of the child were a  primary
    consideration, it was not established that those interests required the
    Appellant to remain in the UK.

10.  Grounds  of  appeal  argued  that  the  Appellant's   long   residence
    application having been refused only  due  to  gaps  in  residence  and
    suitability, and those issues having been resolved  in  his  favour  on
    appeal, the appeal should have been allowed. He had been determined  to
    have met the relevant Immigration  Rules  and  thus,  for  that  reason
    alone, his expulsion would  be  disproportionate  to  the  private  and
    family life he had established in the UK.

11. Permission to appeal was granted on 22 November 2018 by the  First-tier
    Tribunal, on the basis  that  the  Judge  had  failed  to  address  the
    implications of whether the Appellant had satisfied the requirements of
    the long residence route.

12. A Rule 24 response of 7 December 2018 argued that

      a) The First-tier Tribunal was wrong  to  hold  that  the  Appellant's
         section 3C leave could be "resurrected" by  the  setting  aside  of
         decisions by consent;

      b) The Tribunal was also wrong to find that leave to  remain  had  not
         been curtailed in October 2014 via the IS151A, given that the  very
         reason why the December 2015 decision was withdrawn, was because of
         the failure to mention the allegation of TOEIC  fraud:  indeed  the
         Secretary of State's records demonstrated  that  the  decision  had
         been "served to file" as the Appellant was  not  believed  to  have
         updated the Home Office with his current address;

      c) In any event, the rejection of the application in August  2015  for
         want of a passport unequivocally ended the possession of leave;

      d) It was untenable for the Judge to have held that the  confusion  in
         the decision letters could override the public interest in refusing
         the Appellant indefinite leave to remain given the  serious  nature
         of TOEIC fraud.

13. Much of this response was expressed to  be  raised  by  way  of  cross-
    appeal; Mr Tufan candidly accepted that not every  point  made  therein
    was tenable, though pointed to EG Ethiopia as entitling a respondent to
    an appeal to challenge findings  notwithstanding  they  had  lodged  no
    appeal grounds themselves. He acknowledged that point (a) was misguided
    given the clear findings of the Tribunal on the  issue:  there  was  in
    fact no break in leave prior to 2015 given the Consent  Order  had  set
    aside the adverse  decisions  that  would  otherwise  have  broken  the
    Appellant's continuous residence. Nevertheless, he maintained that  the
    First-tier Tribunal was justified in dismissing the Appellant's appeal,
    and had in fact come to perverse conclusions in approaching the case as
    favourably as it had done: once English language fraud was established,
    it would be very difficult  for  the  public  interest  in  maintaining
    immigration control to be overcome. In any event,  the  Tribunal  could
    not reasonably have found the Appellant to have accumulated a decade of
    lawful residence, given the invalidity of the May 2015 application  had
    stopped the clock.

14. Mr Sharma submitted that the First-tier Tribunal had effectively  found
    that ten years  lawful  residence  were  established,  as  it  had  not
    rejected  the  Appellant's   evidence   regarding   the   circumstances
    surrounding  the  declaration  of  his  application  as  invalid.   The
    appropriate course of action would be to allow the appeal,  given  that
    the only issues that had defeated the application were eligibility  and
    suitability for the long residence route; once the Rules  were  met,  a
    decision should be recognised as  disproportionate  to  any  subsequent
    interference with private and family life.  Given  the  Respondent  now
    wished to take further points, the lawfulness of the ETS finding should
    treated as open to challenge too: no adequate finding had been made  on
    the Appellant's responses in oral evidence. He  informed  the  Tribunal
    that the Appellant's son had been granted indefinite  leave  to  remain
    recently; he understood that this was on the same basis as the mother's
    application. This, he submitted, would be an important consideration in
    the event of any continuation hearing.

15. Mr Tufan  maintained  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  come  to  a
    reasonable decision, albeit  one  that  in  some  respects  was  overly
    generous to the Appellant. He noted that no challenge to  the  findings
    on the TOIEC fraud allegations had been raised in the grounds.

Findings and reasons

16. This is an appeal where the Appellant's essential submission  was  that
    he qualified for the ten years long lawful  residence  route.  He  also
    relied on his extant relationship with his partner and child, who  were
    present in the UK. Thus these issues arose for the First-tier  Tribunal
    to determine: whether the Appellant:

      a) Had acquired ten years of continuous lawful residence;

      b) Had deceived the authorities  in  obtaining  the  English  language
         qualification upon which he based an earlier application for  leave
         to remain;

      c) Was suitable for the grant of leave in the light of the  allegation
         of deception made against him;

      d) Was eligible for any grant of leave under the Rules (eg  the  "long
         residence" or "parent" route), or outside them  (which  encompassed
         the question as to whether, if he departed the UK, he would  suffer
         a disproportionate interference with his private  and  family  life
         with his partner and her adult son, and his daughter  from  another
         relationship);

      e) Should in  consequence  succeed  in  his  appeal  on  human  rights
         grounds.

17. The answers given by the First-tier Tribunal to those questions were:

      a) Unclear: there is no clarity as to whether the Tribunal  considered
         that the Appellant had achieved a decade of lawful residence;

      b) The Appellant had not  succeeded  in  rebutting  the  Secretary  of
         State's allegation of dishonesty against him;

      c) The confusion in the immigration history and the decisions made  by
         the Secretary of State in relation to the Appellant suggested  that
         he had,  subsequent to the ETS fraud, been granted  leave  in  full
         knowledge of that  misdemeanour:  thus  he  should  be  treated  as
         "Suitable" for the immigration route in question;

      d)  However,  his  application's  refusal  would  not  result  in  any
         disproportionate interference with his private and family life,  as
         there was no evidence as to him having any significant relationship
         with his daughter, or that Ms [P] and the Appellant's step-son held
         leave in the UK, and so it  could  be  presumed  that  his  current
         family  unit  would  have  the  option  of  departing  the  country
         together;

      e) Accordingly his appeal failed.

18. Unsurprisingly, the Secretary of State  contests  the  third  of  those
    conclusions with  particular  vigour,  given  the  public  interest  in
    defending immigration control by discouraging others  from  seeking  to
    dishonestly obtain leave by deception.

19. As heralded in the summary of  the  Response  and  related  submissions
    above, the Secretary of State contends that some of the  findings  made
    in the Appellant's favour were in fact misdirected. It is open  to  the
    Respondent to make points of this nature: in EG &  NG  Ethiopia  [2013]
    UKUT 143 (IAC) (a decision pre-dating the  amendments  to  the  appeals
    system introduced by the  Immigration  Act  2014,  though  it  was  not
    suggested before me that those amendments rendered it  inapplicable  to
    modern appeals) the Upper Tribunal stated:

         "46.     Suppose a man seeks  entry  clearance  as  a  husband  and
         suppose that the Entry Clearance Officer  finds  that  he  has  not
         shown  that  he  can  be  either  accommodated  or  maintained   in
         accordance with the rules. A First-tier Tribunal Judge may  decide,
         arguably wrongly, that the husband can  satisfy  the  accommodation
         requirements but not the maintenance requirements.  In  that  event
         the judge would dismiss the  appeal.  The  Entry  Clearance  Office
         would have no  interest  in  appealing.  He  is  content  with  the
         decision to dismiss the appeal. The husband  however  may  want  to
         challenge the decision. He might want to argue  that  the  decision
         that he did not satisfy the maintenance requirements was  wrong  in
         law and he may be given permission to appeal.  In  that  event  the
         Entry Clearance Officer may well want to argue not  only  that  the
         decision that the husband did not meet the maintenance requirements
         was right but that the decision that he did meet the  accommodation
         requirements was wrong. In short, without  wanting  to  appeal  the
         decision, the Entry Clearance Officer may want to rely on a  ground
         that failed before the First-tier Tribunal.  Rule  24  permits  the
         Entry Clearance Office to give notice of  his  intention  to  raise
         such a point in a reply. In short rule 24 does have a meaning  that
         does not  depend  on  Ms  Dubinsky's  premise  and  we  reject  the
         construction that she urged on us. Rule 24 does not create a  right
         of appeal to a party who has not asked for  permission  to  appeal.
         Rule 24 is not in any way to do with seeking permission  to  appeal
         and it is not an alternative to seeking permission where permission
         is needed.  It is to do with giving notice about how the respondent
         intends to respond to the appeal that the appellant has  permission
         to pursue. If a respondent  wants  to  argue  that  the  First-tier
         Tribunal should have reached a materially different conclusion then
         the respondent needs permission to appeal.

         47.       This  is  probably  more  significant  in   international
         protection cases than entry clearance cases because an  appeal  can
         be allowed on different grounds. An appellant may have  shown,  for
         example, alternatively, that  he  is  a  refugee,  or  entitled  to
         humanitarian protection or that removal is contrary to  his  rights
         under article 8 of the European Convention  on  Human  Rights.  The
         beneficial consequences of success would be different in each case.
         For  example  a  person  found  to  be  entitled  to   humanitarian
         protection may want to argue that he should have been recognised as
         a refugee whilst the Secretary of State may want to argue that  the
         appeal should only have been allowed with reference to  article  8.
         In such cases both parties would want a result materially different
         from  the  one  decided  by  the  Tribunal  and  both  should  seek
         permission to appeal."

20. In the light of the relatively complex set of findings in play and  the
    party's approach to them, it is appropriate to address them in stages.

21. Firstly there is the Appellant's claim to have met the requirements  of
    the long residence route. Of course,  modern  appeals  are  brought  on
    Human Rights Convention grounds rather than simply against  immigration
    decisions, and so the mere fact a person might meet the Rules would not
    inevitably entail their appeal's success. However, Sir Ernest Ryder  in
    TZ (Pakistan) and PG (India) [2018] EWCA Civ 1109 �35 explained:

         "The policy of the Secretary of State as expressed in the Rules  is
         not to be ignored when a decision about article 8  is  to  be  made
         outside the Rules ...  where a person satisfies the Rules,  whether
         or not by reference to an article 8 informed requirement, then this
         will be positively determinative of that person's article 8 appeal,
         provided their case engages article 8(1), for the very reason  that
         it would then be disproportionate for that person to be removed."

22. Accordingly it is always important for the First-tier Tribunal to  make
    an  accurate  assessment  of  the  extent  to  which   an   immigration
    application meets the requirements of the Rules. In  this  appeal,  the
    consequence of the Judge's  acceptance  that  the  Respondent  had  not
    served any notice of illegality or curtailment upon the  Appellant  was
    that he held leave until mid-2015. Rule 276B provides:

         "Long residence in the United Kingdom

         276A. For the purposes of paragraphs 276B to 276D and 276ADE(1).

             ...

             (b) "lawful residence" means  residence  which  is  continuous
             residence pursuant to:

                  (i) existing leave to enter or remain; or

             ...

         Requirements for an  extension  of  stay  on  the  ground  of  long
         residence in the United Kingdom

         276A1.The requirement to be met by a person seeking an extension of
         stay on the ground of long residence in the United Kingdom is  that
         the applicant meets each of the requirements in paragraph  276B(i)-
         (ii) and (v).

         ...

         276B. The requirements to be met by  an  applicant  for  indefinite
         leave to remain on the ground  of  long  residence  in  the  United
         Kingdom are that:

             (i) ... he  has  had  at  least  10  years  continuous  lawful
             residence in the United Kingdom.

             (ii)      having regard to the public interest  there  are  no
             reasons why it would  be  undesirable  for  him  to  be  given
             indefinite leave to remain on the ground  of  long  residence,
             taking into account his:

                  (a)  age; and

                  (b)  strength of connections in the United Kingdom; and

                  (c)   personal  history,  including  character,   conduct,
                  associations and employment record; and

                  (d)  domestic circumstances; and

                  (e)  compassionate circumstances; and

                  (f)  any representations received on the person's  behalf;
                  and

             (iii)     the applicant does not fall for  refusal  under  the
             general grounds for refusal.

             (iv)      the applicant has demonstrated sufficient  knowledge
             of the English language and sufficient knowledge about life in
             the United Kingdom, in accordance with Appendix KoLL.

             (v) the  applicant  must  not  be  in  the  UK  in  breach  of
             immigration laws, except that, where paragraph  39E  of  these
             Rules applies, any  current  period  of  overstaying  will  be
             disregarded.  Any  previous  period  of  overstaying   between
             periods of leave will also be disregarded where -

                  (a)  the previous application was made before 24  November
                  2016 and within 28 days of the expiry of leave; or

                  (b)  the further application  was  made  on  or  after  24
                  November 2016 and paragraph 39E of these Rules applied."

23. Notwithstanding the finding that his leave continued after the  failure
    to serve the 2014 decision  upon  him,  the  Appellant  had  still  not
    acquired a decade of lawful residence before his leave ran out in 2015.
    The notification of his May 2015 application's  invalidity  (in  August
    2015) meant that his leave to remain had in  fact  expired  on  30  May
    2015. His argument is essentially that  the  policy  objective  in  the
    Rule, of rewarding a period of ten  years'  lawful  residence,  is  not
    inconsistent with granting  him  leave,  as  he  was  innocent  of  any
    contribution to the invalidity of his application; he  could  not  have
    made a valid application as the Secretary of State had failed  to  take
    the appropriate steps to return his passport to him.

24. There is a line of authority, ranging from Patel to MM (Lebanon),  that
    holds that satisfaction of the policy imperatives of the  Rules  should
    be  taken  into  account  in  a   migrant's   favour   when   assessing
    proportionality So it requires no great leap in reasoning  to  conclude
    that the Appellant, having done  everything  he  could  to  secure  his
    passport's return so that  he  could  make  a  timely  and  thus  valid
    application, should not be treated as if there was a significant  break
    in his leave. Had it not been for the Secretary of State's retention of
    his passport, there is no reason to think the decision making timetable
    on his case would have been any different, and indeed his  leave  would
    have continued until the present appeal was finally determined,  taking
    him well over a decade of lawful residence.

25. As it happens, the First-tier Tribunal gave no overt  consideration  to
    this issue, though I appreciate that the Appellant had put  a  reasoned
    case forward which might have succeeded had  it  been  considered.   Mr
    Sharma argued that the Tribunal should have been taken as accepting the
    Appellant's arguments on this point, given the  general  tenor  of  its
    reasoning. I do not think one can reasonably go that far; one  has  the
    impression that the Tribunal was oblivious to the point. I  am  willing
    to accept that this is a tenable argument, and so I shall not treat the
    absence of findings upon it as fatal to the Appellant's chances.

26. The next question to be determined is the Appellant's  good  character,
    in the light of the Judge's acceptance that the Secretary of State  had
    discharged  the  burden  of  proof  that  the  Appellant  had  provided
    fraudulent English language test results. The question  of  "character"
    has two potential reference points in Rule 276B: firstly as a  positive
    requirement for the grant of leave (276B(ii)(c)),  and  secondly  as  a
    potential block on the grant of leave under the general refusal reasons
    (276B(iii)). As stated by Sir Patrick Elias in Babar  [2018]  EWCA  Civ
    329 �12:

         "Paragraph 276B(ii) is poorly drafted;  the  words  "there  are  no
         reasons why" are confusing.  There will often be something  in  the
         character or conduct of the applicant  which,  taken  on  its  own,
         would constitute a reason why it would be undesirable to grant ILR.
         But it is well established that rules of this nature should be read
         sensibly, recognising that they are statements of the Secretary  of
         State's  administrative  policy  ...  and  the  paragraph   plainly
         envisages that there will be cases where, assessing the factors  as
         a whole,  it  would  not  be  in  the  public  interest  to  refuse
         indefinite leave even though some factors may point  in  favour  of
         refusing it. A recent policy statement from the Secretary of  State
         issued to staff and entitled "Long Residence" confirms that this is
         the correct approach. When dealing  with  the  public  interest  it
         states:

             "You must assess the factors in paragraph 276B(ii)  to  decide
             whether a grant of  indefinite  leave  would  be  against  the
             public interest. You must look  at  reasons  for  and  against
             granting indefinite leave using the factors listed and,  where
             necessary, weigh up whether a grant of indefinite leave  would
             be in the public interest.""

27. It seems to me that the First-tier Tribunal's reasoning  addresses  the
    second of these issues (i.e. "suitability" by reference to the  general
    refusal reasons), but not  the  first  (i.e.  "character",  necessarily
    "good character", as an affirmative requirement).

28. I accept, applying the reasoning set out in EG & NG Ethiopia, that  the
    Secretary of State is entitled to challenge the approach taken  to  the
    second issue notwithstanding that he is the Respondent to  the  appeal,
    and without applying for permission to appeal. Appropriate  notice  has
    been given via the Rule 24 Response.

29. It seems to me that given the history  of  confusion  in  the  decision
    making to which the First-tier Tribunal alluded, it  was  open  to  the
    Judge to find that the Home Office had, however surprisingly,  condoned
    the Appellant's fraud by  granting  further  leave.  That  was  a  very
    generous finding but not an irrational one.

30. However, that is not the end  of  the  matter.  On  appeal  matters  of
    proportionality, and in that question's assessment the meeting  of  the
    Rules, are matters for the Judge,  not  the  Secretary  of  State.  The
    posture struck by the Secretary of State may be relevant, but the Judge
    needed to make his own distinct evaluation of whether the Appellant had
    satisfied the requirement that his character and conduct  presented  no
    obstacle to  the  grant  of  leave.  That  requirement  of  independent
    judicial evaluation  is  all  the  greater  when  the  cogency  of  the
    Secretary of State's thinking is questionable, as was the finding here.
    The failure so to do represents a significant flaw in  the  finding  on
    the "general refusal reasons" element of the case.

31. There is then the question of the Appellant's qualification for the ten
    year route on the basis of having affirmatively established himself  as
    a person of good character. It is one thing to  say  that  the  general
    refusal reasons should not be held against the Appellant because he has
    subsequently been granted limited leave without  those  reasons  having
    been invoked. But it is quite another to say that he should be  granted
    indefinite leave to remain in a category which expressly assesses one's
    character as part of an overall balancing exercise before  the  general
    refusal reasons are even reached. It would  mock  the  requirements  of
    immigration control to conclude otherwise.

32. As it happens, I have already found that the Judge's  consideration  of
    "character" in so far as that was considered below is  flawed,  so  the
    question of the thinking on the "general refusal reasons" carrying over
    to the affirmative establishment of good character does not arise.

33. Where does that leave the appeal? The Appellant has established that he
    was a potential candidate for the long residence route by virtue of his
    length of lawful residence. However, the Respondent has challenged  the
    findings on suitability for the grant of leave, and I have found  those
    findings wanting.

34. As stated in Babar, there is a need  to  balance  the  various  factors
    present in the case.  The parties before me  did  not  suggest  that  a
    continuation hearing was required to finally determine the issues  that
    are open to  re-determination.  I  accordingly  conduct  the  balancing
    exercise now. The Appellant's UK links must  be  measured  against  the
    public interest in his departure from the UK.

35. Of course, those links do not include any  tangible  interference  with
    the Appellant's family life with his partner and his adult step-son, or
    with his own daughter, given that no challenge has been brought to  the
    finding that he had not demonstrated that  he  played  any  significant
    role in his daughter's life, nor to the  conclusion  that  it  was  not
    established on  the  evidence  previously  available  that  his  former
    partner and daughter would be remaining in the  UK.  It  was  intimated
    before me that the daughter may now have been granted  leave.  However,
    given the unchallenged findings on family life, that does not alter the
    situation. It is always  open  to  the  Appellant  to  make  a  further
    application if his family life situation has materially changed.

36. The Appellant's other links with the UK appear slight. He  has  resided
    here for a significant period. He can be assumed to have  made  friends
    at college and to have developed social connections in the UK.  He  has
    family connections in the UK, but limited ones, for  the  reasons  just
    discussed. I do not consider that connections of this modest nature are
    sufficiently weighty to outweigh his involvement  in  English  language
    testing fraud. So the balancing exercise is resolved  against  him,  so
    far as the Rules are concerned.

37. The same considerations  animate  the  consideration  of  the  ultimate
    question on this appeal, ie whether the  immigration  decision  against
    which it is brought represents a disproportionate interference with his
    Article 8 rights. I have treated the Appellant's UK links  as  part  of
    the Rule 276B balancing exercise so far, but they are  also  the  basis
    for the necessary consideration of  his  case  outside  the  Rules.  As
    stated by Underhill LJ in Ahsan and  Ors  [2017]  EWCA  Civ  2009  �86,
    concisely summarising the authorities governing the approach to private
    life in recent years, "persons admitted to this  country  to  pursue  a
    course of study are likely, over time, to develop  a  private  life  of
    sufficient depth to engage article 8."

38. However, Underhill LJ also pointed out at �87 that a student's  removal
    would normally be proportionate unless  they  could  qualify  for  some
    route under the Immigration Rules. The same thinking must  apply  to  a
    former student who has not subsequently regularised their  status,  and
    much of whose UK residence is down to extended periods  of  section  3C
    leave rather than having affirmatively established an entitlement based
    on presently having a viable case under the Rules.

39. The Appellant can only receive limited credit for any English  language
    facility having cheated in a past language test. There is  no  evidence
    that he is dependent  on  public  funds.  At  best  these  factors  are
    essentially neutral. He has also resided in the UK on  a  non-permanent
    basis, without indefinite leave to remain,  and  so  his  presence  has
    always been precarious. I conclude that his Article 8 rights  will  not
    be the subject of  disproportionate  interference  by  the  immigration
    decision being upheld.

40. I accordingly dismiss the appeal.

Decision

The appeal is dismissed.
