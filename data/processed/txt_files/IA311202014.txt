Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Chohan, Counsel instructed by SBM Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant, a citizen of India, applied on 31 May 2014 for leave  as
    a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant.   The   respondent   refused   his
    application on 24 July 2014.  His appeal was heard by Judge Seelhoff of
    the First-tier Tribunal in December 2014 and on 6 January 2015 he  sent
    a decision dismissing it.  The appellant's application  for  permission
    to appeal to the Upper Tribunal failed before the  First-tier  Tribunal
    and the Upper Tribunal, but was eventually, granted  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal on a "Cart" judicial review, reference being made to the Supreme
    Court decision in Mandalia [2015] UKSC 55 (a decision dealing with  the
    respondent's evidentiary flexibility policy/rules).

2.   The reason the respondent refused the  appellant's  application  on  24
    July 2014 was stated to be that he had failed to establish that he  met
    the requirements of para 41-SD(d)(i) and (ii)  of  Appendix  A  of  the
    Immigration Rules because no declaration had been supplied by the third
    party concerned to establish that there were funds available to him  of
    �50,000 and  no  declaration  from  a  legal  representative  had  been
    supplied to establish that the letter of permission supplied was valid.

3.   The appellant's grounds  of  appeal  to  the  FtT  submitted  that  all
    original documents had been provided with the application made  by  the
    appellant's Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Team Member (Mr Khan), along with the
    covering letter, on 30 June 2014.  It was pointed  out  that  this  was
    before the date of refusal of the appellant's Tier 1  application.   Mr
    Khan's application was granted on 16 August 2014.

4.    Before  Judge  Seelhoff  the  appellant's  representative  (Mr  Ahmed)
    conceded that the appellant could not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    relevant Rules because the lawyer declarations in respect of any  third
    party funds required under para 41-SD(d)(ii)  of  Appendix  A  did  not
    exist at the time he applied for leave to remain - they were not signed
    until 13 and 19 June 2014 respectively, i.e. two and three weeks  after
    the  date  of  application.   Mr  Ahmed's  submission  was   that   the
    appellant's appeal should nevertheless be allowed because the  decision
    was clearly unfair as the Home Office were aware that the  applications
    concerned  entrepreneurial  team  members  and  that  each  application
    referred to the other.  The appellant's letter of 23 June 2014 had  put
    the Home Office on notice that the original documents were in the  post
    and would be provided.  Mr Ahmed submitted that that letter -  combined
    with the fact that Mr Khan named the appellant when  he  submitted  his
    own application - should have been sufficient for the two files  to  be
    linked.  He relied on para 245AA of the Rules  which  require  that  an
    appellant send missing documents when requested within 7  working  days
    of a request.

5.   Judge Seelhoff was not persuaded by the submission based  on  fairness,
    reasoning at paras 16-18 as follows:

         "16. The terms of the policy at paragraph 245AA of the  Immigration
             Rules require that an Appellant send missing  documents  where
             requested within seven working days of  a  request,  but  also
             state that requests will only  be  made  for  originals  where
             copies have already been  provided  or  where  a  document  is
             missing from a series.  The Respondent did give the  Appellant
             an opportunity to provide the missing  documents  despite  the
             fact that the third party funding  declarations  witnessed  by
             the  lawyers  had  not  been  enclosed   with   the   original
             application even in copy form.  Accordingly under the  wording
             of  paragraph  245AA  it  was  not  even  necessary  for   the
             Respondent to have  made  this  request.   The  Appellant  was
             unable to  provide  those  documents  within  the  seven  days
             provided for under the rules.  I consider that the  Respondent
             attempted to be fairer than the policy required her to be.


         17.  In respect of fairness I also consider that the Appellant  has
             not done all  he  could  to  draw  to  the  attention  of  the
             Respondent the fact  that  the  original  documents  had  been
             submitted  with  his  partner's  application.   Any   sensible
             applicant would  have  ensured  that  a  letter  went  to  the
             caseworker with conduct of his case to  advise  her  that  the
             original documents had now been submitted albeit with  another
             application.  The cover letter to Mr  Khan's  application  may
             have named the Appellant, but it did not give his  application
             reference and it did not include a request that  the  original
             documents be linked to this Appellant's file.  I consider that
             the  Appellant  bears  significant  responsibility   for   the
             documents not being linked to his file.  The Respondent has to
             deal with a significant number of  applications  and  not  all
             applications of the same type pass across the desk of the same
             caseworker.   I  consider  that  there  was  a   fundamentally
             unreasonable expectation that the documents would be linked in
             this case.


         18.  Assessing the case in the round it is clear that at  the  date
             of application the Appellant was not entitled  to  expect  his
             application to be granted.  The Appellant was not entitled  to
             expect the Respondent to contact  him  to  request  additional
             evidence as he could not possibly have provided a copy of  the
             lawyer declarations with his  applications  as  they  did  not
             exist.  In that situation it  is  difficult  to  see  how  the
             Respondent's decision could be said to be procedurally  unfair
             given that not all the mandatory evidence required  under  the
             rules  existed  at  the  date  of   application.    In   these
             circumstances it is hard to see how the  Respondent  could  be
             criticised for not doing more than she could."

6.   The grounds seeking permission to appeal argue that by  virtue  of  the
    appellant having filled in the mandatory fields in the application form
    (requiring information relating to team member application details when
    there is a  two  member  team  making  the  Tier  1  application),  the
    respondent was under an obligation to  consider  the  two  applications
    together and to link up the information provided in the  team  member's
    application.  The material fact was that there  was  only  one  set  of
    original documents.

7.    Mr  Chohan's  submissions  before  me  were  to  similar  effect.   He
    highlighted the fact that because of the  need  to  produce  originals,
    some of the documents had to be re-done in Pakistan.  If the respondent
    had properly applied the evidential flexibility rules  she  would  have
    accepted that there  was  satisfactory  evidence  (i)  that  there  was
    �50,000 available in a regulated bank; and (ii) that the account holder
    had that money.  The lawyer's declaration served only to  confirm  that
    the account holder was who he said he was.

8.   Ms Everett submitted that the judge had not erred in  law  because  the
    appellant failed to provide the documents required.  Having promised to
    send the original documents, he did not produce them.  They  were  only
    provided with the team member's application.  In any event, the lack of
    a lawyer's declaration was a requirement of the Rules that was  plainly
    not met.  The  details  given  by  Mr  Khan  in  his  application  were
    insufficient  to  alert  the  respondent  of  the  appellant's  pending
    application.

My decision

9.   Although Mr Chohan  initially  queried  why  the  appellant's  previous
    representative (Mr Ahmed) had conceded the appellant could not  succeed
    under the Immigration Rules, he subsequently  accepted  that  this  was
    correct.  I find in any event that  the  judge  was  plainly  right  to
    conclude that the appellant failed to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules  since  there   were   specified   documents,   namely   lawyer's
    declarations, that were missing from  his  application.   The  relevant
    rule permits of no discretion.  It states:

         "(d) If the applicant is applying using money from a  third  party,
             he must provide all of the following  specified  documents  (n
             addition to the specified documents in (c) above):


             (ii) A letter from a legal representative (who is  independent
                  from the third party or  third  parties),  confirming  the
                  validity of signatures on  each  third-party  declarations
                  provided, which confirms that the declaration(s) from  the
                  third party or  parties  contain  the  signatures  of  the
                  people stated.  It can be a  single  letter  covering  all
                  third-party permissions, or several letters  from  several
                  legal representatives.  It must be an original letter  and
                  not a copy, and it must be  from  a  legal  representative
                  permitted to practise in the country where the third party
                  or the  money  is.   The  letter  must  clearly  show  the
                  following:


                  (1)  the name of the legal representative  confirming  the
                      details;


                  (2)   the  registration  or   authority   of   the   legal
                      representative to practise legally in the country  in
                      which the  permission  or  permissions  was  or  were
                      given;


                  (3)  the date of the confirmation letter. ...".

10.  The appellant's case hinges therefore on whether the  judge  was  right
    to conclude that the appellant was still entitled  to  succeed  in  his
    appeal on the footing that the  respondent  had  failed  to  apply  her
    evidentiary flexibility rules to the circumstances of his case.   I  am
    mindful when considering this matter  that  a  very  senior  judge  was
    persuaded that there was at least an  arguable  error  in  the  judge's
    treatment of this issue.

11.  However, having had the opportunity to  consider  the  matter  in  more
    detail on the basis of full submissions from both  parties,  I  am  not
    persuaded that there was any error on the part of  the  judge.   In  my
    judgement much of the argument on both sides regarding the  application
    of the evidentiary flexibility rules (and  in  particular  whether  the
    respondent should have linked the appellant's and  his  team  partner's
    application and seen that the evidence contained in the  team  parties'
    application was relevant to both applications)  has  not  been  to  the
    point.  Even if the respondent had linked the two applications and made
    her decision on the appellant's application with  full  regard  to  the
    evidence sent with the term partner's application, this would not  have
    made any difference to the fact that the  appellant's  application  did
    not include all the specified documents.  The  appellant's  application
    was made on 31 May 2014.  Mr Khan was able to succeed under  the  Rules
    because the lawyer's declarations attesting to the bona  fides  of  the
    bank declaration were dated 13 and 19 June, i.e. prior to the  date  of
    his application.  The appellant, by  contrast,  had  not  produced  any
    lawyer declarations except for those dated 13 and  19  June  i.e.  ones
    dated after the date of his application.

12.  So far as concerns the evidentiary flexibility  rule  it  did  not  and
    cannot assist the appellant's case.  First of all, the  respondent  did
    operate this rule,  by  writing  to  the  appellant  on  13  June  2014
    requesting that he send third-party funding  documentation.   Secondly,
    even assuming that the appellant can be taken to have responded (as  he
    claims he did by arranging with his team partner for  his  third  party
    documentation to accompany the letter's application), his response  was
    to submit lawyer declarations  post-dating  his  application.   As  was
    stated by Rafferty LJ in MQ  v  SSHD  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  726,  for  any
    application  of  the  evidential  flexibility  provisions  to  succeed,
    documents have to be in existence at the date of application.

13.  Paragraph 245AA (headed "Documents  not  submitted  with  applications)
    does  provide  at  subparagraph  (a)  for  consideration  of  documents
    submitted after  the  application  "if  submitted  in  accordance  with
    subparagraph (b)"; but the four circumstances specified in subparagraph
    (b) all relate to documents in existence at the time of application.

Notice of Decision

14.  For the above reasons I conclude that the FtT judge did not  materially
    err in law in concluding that the appellant could not  succeed  in  his
    appeal. Accordingly the judge's decision must stand.

15.  No anonymity direction is made.
