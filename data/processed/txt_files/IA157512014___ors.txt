For the Appellants:     Ms N Nnamani, Counsel instructed by Ardens
Solicitors
For the Respondent:   Mr T Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants, who  are  nationals  of  Mongolia,  have  been  granted
    permission to appeal by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Astle  against
    a decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Mill  who,  following  a
    hearing on 25 March 2015, dismissed their appeals against a decision of
    the respondent of 12 March 2014 to refuse their application of  6  July
    2012 for leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the  basis  of  their
    rights to their private and family life under Article 8  of  the  ECHR,
    supplemented by further representations made  on  their  behalf  on  24
    February 2014.

 2. The first appellant, born on 5 September  1976,  is  the  wife  of  the
    second appellant, born on 22 April 1976.  They are the parents  of  the
    third appellant, born in Mongolia on 14 August 2001, and the fourth and
    fifth appellants born in the United Kingdom on 5 January  2007  and  11
    September 2013 respectively.

Immigration history

 3. The first and second appellants arrived in the United Kingdom on 11 May
    2003, aged 26 � years and 27 years respectively.  They landed with a 24
    hour in transit visa.  They failed to continue  on  their  journey  and
    remained in the  United  Kingdom.   The  third  appellant  remained  in
    Mongolia until April 2006,  when  a  friend  of  the  second  appellant
    assisted in bringing him to the United Kingdom.  He was 4� years old on
    arrival in the United Kingdom.

 4. At the date of the hearing before Judge  Mill,  the  first  and  second
    appellants were aged 38� years and 39 years respectively, having  lived
    in the United Kingdom for 11 years 10 months.  The third appellant  was
    aged 13� years, having lived in the United Kingdom for nearly 9  years.
    The fourth and fifth  appellants  were  aged  8  years  and  18  months
    respectively and had lived in the United Kingdom all of their lives.

Relevant legal provisions

 5. The version of para 276ADE that came into force on 28 July 2014  is  as
    follows (emphasis added):


        276ADE (1). The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to
        remain on the grounds of private life in the UK  are  that  at  the
        date of application, the applicant:


        (i)  does not fall for refusal under any of the grounds in  Section
           S-LTR 1.2 to S-LTR 2.3. and S-LTR.3.1. in Appendix FM; and


        (ii) has made a valid  application  for  leave  to  remain  on  the
           grounds of private life in the UK; and


        (iii)     has lived continuously in the UK for at  least  20  years
           (discounting any period of imprisonment); or


        (iv) is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously in the
           UK for at least 7 years (discounting any period of imprisonment)
           and it would not be reasonable to expect the applicant to  leave
           the UK; or


        (v)  is aged 18 years or above and under 25 years and has spent  at
           least  half  of  his  life  living  continuously   in   the   UK
           (discounting any period of imprisonment); or


        (vi) subject to sub-paragraph (2), is aged 18 years or  above,  has
           lived continuously in the UK for less than 20 years (discounting
           any period of imprisonment) but there would be very  significant
           obstacles to the applicant's integration  into  the  country  to
           which he would have to go if required to leave the UK.

 6. The wording underlined above replaced the words underlined below in the
    version of para 276ADE that was in force immediately prior to  28  July
    2014, which was as follows:


        276ADE (1). The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to
        remain on the grounds of private life in the UK  are  that  at  the
        date of application, the applicant:


        (i)  does not fall for refusal under any of the grounds in  Section
           S-LTR 1.2 to S-LTR 2.3. and S-LTR.3.1. in Appendix FM; and


        (ii) has made a valid  application  for  leave  to  remain  on  the
           grounds of private life in the UK; and


        (iii)     has lived continuously in the UK for at  least  20  years
           (discounting any period of imprisonment); or


        (iv) is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously in the
           UK for at least 7 years (discounting any period of imprisonment)
           and it would not be reasonable to expect the applicant to  leave
           the UK; or


        (v)  is aged 18 years or above and under 25 years and has spent  at
           least  half  of  his  life  living  continuously   in   the   UK
           (discounting any period of imprisonment); or


        (vi) subject to sub-paragraph (2), is aged 18 years or  above,  has
           lived continuously in the UK for less than 20 years (discounting
           any period of imprisonment) but has no ties  (including  social,
           cultural or family) with the country to which he would  have  to
           go if required to leave the UK.

 7. Exhibit EX.1(a) of Appendix FM provides:


        EX.1. This paragraph applies if
        (a)
          (i)  the  applicant  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
        relationship with a child who-


             (aa)     is under the age of 18 years, or was under the age of
                 18 years when the applicant was first granted leave on  the
                 basis that this paragraph applied;
             (bb)     is in the UK;
             (cc)      is  a  British  Citizen  or  has  lived  in  the  UK
                 continuously for at least the 7 years immediately preceding
                 the date of application; and


         (ii)     it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
        the UK; or


        (b)  ...

 8. Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  (the
    "2002 Act") provides as follows:


        117A Application of this Part


          (1)      This Part applies where a court or tribunal  is  required
           to determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-



         (a)  breaches a person's right to respect for  private  and  family
        life under Article 8, and
         (b) as a result would be unlawful under section  6  of  the  Human
        Rights Act 1998.


          (2)      In considering the public interest question, the court or
           tribunal must (in particular) have regard-


         (a) in all cases, to the considerations listed  in  section  117B,
        and
         (b)  in cases concerning the deportation of foreign  criminals,  to
           the considerations listed in section 117C.


          (3) In subsection (2), "the public interest  question"  means  the
           question of whether an interference with  a  person's  right  to
           respect for private and family life is justified  under  Article
           8(2).


        117B Article 8: public interest considerations  applicable  in  all
        cases


        (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in  the
        public interest.


          (2) It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are
           able to speak English, because persons who can speak English-


         (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
         (b) are better able to integrate into society.


          (3) It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are
           financially independent, because such persons-


         (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
         (b) are better able to integrate into society.


        (4)  Little weight should be given to-


         (a) a private life, or
         (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
         that is established by a person at a time when  the  person  is  in
              the United Kingdom unlawfully.

          (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by
           a person at a time  when  the  person's  immigration  status  is
           precarious.


          (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
           public interest does not require the person's removal where-


               (a)   the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
              relationship with a qualifying child, and
              (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
     the United Kingdom.

Judge Mill's decision

 9. As the  hearing  before  Judge  Mill  (hereafter,  the  "judge"  unless
    otherwise stated) took place on 25 March 2015, he should  have  applied
    the version of para 276ADE that  came  into  force  on  28  July  2014.
    However, he applied instead the version that was in force  on  27  July
    2014. The difference between the two versions  can  be  seen  from  the
    words underlined at [6] and  [7]  above.  This  means  that  the  judge
    applied the "no ties" stipulation to the first  and  second  appellants
    instead of considering whether there were very significant obstacles to
    the integration of the appellants in Mongolia.  I raised this point  at
    the commencement of the hearing. It was not mentioned in  the  grounds.
    Mr Wilding and Ms Nnamani agreed that, if I concluded  that  the  judge
    did not materially err in law in reaching his finding  that  the  first
    and second appellants did not satisfy the "no ties"  stipulation,  then
    the error in applying the wrong version of para 276ADE(vi) would not be
    material. Ms Nnamani said that she would not make  an  application  for
    permission to amend the grounds.

10. The judge's findings may be summarised as follows:

    (i)  The judge did not find  the  evidence  of  the  first  and  second
        appellants credible or reliable.

    (ii) He rejected their evidence that they had  no  continuing  ties  to
        Mongolia.

    (iii)    He did not believe their evidence that they had been  able  to
        maintain themselves in the United Kingdom on money they obtained by
        their working informally and occasionally, their receiving  support
        from a Mr Nasim Ahmed, their receiving the proceeds from  the  sale
        of a property in Mongolia that fell into the ownership of the first
        appellant after her sister passed away and their  receiving  rental
        income from the subletting of a  room  in  their  property  in  the
        United Kingdom.

    (iv) He rejected their evidence that their children only have  a  basic
        understanding of spoken Mongolian and that they were unable to read
        and write in that language.  He said that there  was  little  doubt
        that the third appellant will have  a  good  understanding  of  the
        Mongolian language. Whilst he noted that the fourth appellant was 8
        years old and had never lived in Mongolia, he did not  accept  that
        the fourth appellant had not, whilst living in the same family unit
        as the first, second and third appellants,  acquired  knowledge  of
        the Mongolian language which was spoken in the household.

    (v)  He concluded that the first and second appellants did not  satisfy
        the "no ties" stipulation in para 276ADE(vi).

    (vi) The fifth appellant, being only 18 months old, could  not  benefit
        from the Immigration Rules.  His circumstances therefore fell to be
        considered  outwith  the  Immigration  Rules.   Given   the   fifth
        appellant's tender years, that he is undoubtedly primarily  focused
        upon himself and his immediate family, in particular the first  and
        second appellants, he had not begun  to  establish  any  meaningful
        private life.  Accordingly, there would be no breach of  Article  8
        by the removal of the fifth appellant with his parents.

    (vi) In relation to the third and fourth appellants, it  was  necessary
        to consider whether it would be reasonable for them  to  leave  the
        United Kingdom either for the purposes of para 276ADE or  paragraph
        EX.1(a) of Appendix FM.  The judge said that this required  careful
        consideration of all facts and circumstances and the  carrying  out
        of a proportionality test.

    (vii)    The judge then considered the evidence  concerning  the  third
        and fourth appellants and concluded that it would be reasonable for
        them to leave the United Kingdom.  His reasons,  in  this  respect,
        are set out at [37]-[41] of the determination.

    (ix) He then considered the Article 8 claims  outside  the  Immigration
        Rules. He considered the circumstances of  the  third,  fourth  and
        fifth appellants  and  concluded  that  there  were  no  compelling
        circumstances for any of the appellants' appeals to succeed outside
        the Immigration Rules on the basis that their removal would  be  in
        breach of their rights under Article 8.

11. I now quote [18]-[46] of the judge's decision:


       18.    ...


         subsection (iv) of paragraph 276ADE can apply  to  the  Third  and
           Fourth Appellants.
         subsection (vi) of paragraph 276ADE can apply  to  the  First  and
           Second Appellants.


         There is no provision within paragraph 276ADE which can  apply  to
           the Fifth Appellant.


         Section EX, and paragraph EX.1(a) of Appendix FM  could  apply  to
           provide a basis for the First and Second  Appellants  to  obtain
           Leave to Remain as a parent.  There is no  practical  difference
           to the test  to  be  applied  to  that  found  within  paragraph
           276ADE(iv).


       19.    If I was not able to  grant  the  Appeals  in  terms  of  the
           Immigration Rules I was invited to do so on the basis  of  Human
           Rights issues under Article 8  of  the  European  Convention  on
           Human Rights following the steps set out in R (Razgar) -v-  SSHD
           [2004] UKHL 27.

       20.    In coming to a  decision  I  take  into  account  the  public
           interest considerations as specified in Section 117B of Part  5A
           of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as amended.

       21.    The case of ZH (Tanzania) (FC) -v- SSHD [2011] UKSC 4  states
           that there [sic] a removal decision impacts on the welfare of  a
           child, the best interests of the child must  be  [sic]  "primary
           consideration".  In making the  proportionality  assessment  for
           the children under Article 8 the Immigration Authorities and the
           Courts must apply the best interests  principle  as  a  starting
           point.  This is now reflected within Section 55 of the  Borders,
           Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.  I have borne this in mind
           throughout my decision making.

       Findings and Reasons

       22.    The First and Second Appellants  are  citizens  of  Mongolia.
           They both resided there until they were  aged  27  years.   They
           were both born and brought up in Mongolia and will  be  entirely
           familiar  with  traditions,  culture,  environment  and   social
           structure there.  These natural integral ties will not have been
           lost and will continue to exist.

       23.    The First and  Second  Appellants  both  worked  in  Mongolia
           before coming to the  UK.   The  First  Appellant  worked  as  a
           skilled seamstress/tailor and has continued that  employment  in
           the UK.  She has not lost these skills.   The  Second  Appellant
           has undertaken a broad spectrum of  work  throughout  his  adult
           life.  He completed secondary school education in Mongolia.   He
           subsequently worked in Mongolia in a wide variety of employments
           and has multiple skills.  He was a businessman  for  periods  of
           time in Mongolia on a self-employed basis, travelling  to  China
           and buying goods,  including  clothing,  to  sell  in  Mongolia.
           Again he has continued to work in the UK.  The First and  Second
           Appellants  supported  themselves  when  residing  in  Mongolia.
           Given  the  respective  nature  of  their  employments,  and  in
           particular the wide-ranging nature  of  the  Second  Appellant's
           employment history,  they  will  be  well  acquainted  with  the
           economy in Mongolia.  Although they have been  absent  now  from
           there for a period of some 12 years, I do not accept  that  such
           ties in terms  of  their  understanding  and  knowledge  of  the
           economic circumstances of Mongolia and the labour  market  there
           given their knowledge and experience have been extinguished.

       24.    The evidence of the First and Second Appellants  was  to  the
           effect that they have no surviving family in  Mongolia  at  all.
           No evidence was provided to support this but even taking that at
           face value, I do not consider  that  this  adds  weight  to  any
           suggestion that  they  have  no  continuing  ties  to  Mongolia.
           Having departed there at the age of  27  and  having  worked  as
           stated they will have had friends and contacts.  Even  if  these
           relationships have not been preserved attempts can  be  made  to
           renew those or, alternatively, the First  and  Second  Appellant
           will be able to use their  skills  and  knowledge  to  form  new
           contacts and friendships.  They are not  strangers  to  Mongolia
           with no knowledge of the  way  of  life  there.   They  have  no
           disability or incapacity.  They speak the Mongolian language.

       25.    In 2006, some 3 years after the First and  Second  Appellants
           arrived here they made arrangements  for  the  Third  Appellant,
           their eldest child,  to  come  to  the  United  Kingdom.   Their
           explanation in this respect is  that  a  friend  of  the  Second
           Appellant  assisted  them.   The  First  and  Second  Appellants
           clearly maintained relations with  individuals  in  Mongolia  in
           order to make such arrangements and for those arrangements to be
           fulfilled.  The Appellants' evidence was to the effect that  the
           First Appellant's elder sister died in  2007.   Until  then  she
           lived in Mongolia.  The impression formed was  that  there  were
           continuing relations with her until then.

       26.    The First Appellant owned a property in Mongolia jointly with
           her sister until 2007.  The Appellants stated in their  evidence
           that the First Appellant's sister had passed away  then.   Steps
           had been taken by them to sell the property.  In order to do  so
           they must have had communications with others  in  Mongolia  for
           this purpose.  They must have had knowledge  then  about  making
           arrangements in Mongolia for all the steps required to be  taken
           in respect of the sale of a property and the  obtaining  of  the
           sale proceeds.  This exhibits an ability  to  perform  tasks  in
           Mongolia proficiently including the  carrying  out  of  business
           there.

       27.    I conclude on the basis  of  the  totality  of  the  evidence
           before me that the provisions of subparagraph (vi) of  paragraph
           276ADE are not established by the First and  Second  Appellants.
           They have not established that they have no  ties  to  Mongolia.
           In coming to this decision I have had  regard  to  the  case  of
           Ogundimu (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2013] UKUT  60  (IAC).
           I have had regard to the commentary commencing at paragraph  122
           where the phrase "no ties (including social, cultural or family)
           with the country..." is discussed.

       28.    I did not find the First and Second Appellants  credible  nor
           reliable.  There were conflicting statements made by them in the
           evidence.  The First Appellant stated that the Second  Appellant
           was a taxi driver  prior  to  coming  to  the  UK.   The  Second
           Appellant advised that he was involved in a shoemaking  business
           at that time.   Under  cross-examination  the  Second  Appellant
           failed to disclose being a taxi driver until it was specifically
           suggested to him.  He then stated that he had worked as  a  taxi
           driver but this had been for a brief period of time only shortly
           after the marriage.  The oral evidence of the First  and  Second
           Appellants was somewhat  at  odds  with  their  written  witness
           statements available.  The general proposition made by the First
           and Second Appellants is that they are  supported  by  Mr  Nasim
           Ahmed who provided a witness statement.  They have now lived  in
           the United Kingdom for 12 years.  Throughout the course of their
           oral evidence they accepted they have  both  been  working;  the
           First   Appellant   continuing   with   her    skills    as    a
           seamstress/tailor and the Second Appellant undertaking a variety
           of employments, mostly according to them on an  informal  basis.
           They pay and have been paying rent  at  a  rate  of  �1,160  per
           month.  They have been paying  Council  Tax  in  the  region  of
           �1,350 per annum and meeting all other utility bills  and  costs
           associated with running their home and maintaining their family,
           including three children.  The suggestion by them that they have
           managed to  do  this  by  informally  working  occasionally  and
           receiving support, together with having  sold  the  property  in
           Mongolia for a sum equalling �10,000 in  2007,  supplemented  by
           subletting a room in their property is not credible.

       29.    During the Second Appellant giving evidence with the  use  of
           the interpreter an issue arose.  Either the First Appellant,  or
           one of those persons accompanying her as a supporter  in  Court,
           were suggesting audibly to the  interpreter  that  she  was  not
           interpreting  correctly.    The   interpreter,   understandably,
           brought this to my attention and was upset and  concerned.   The
           interpreter declared clearly that she had, as a  matter-of-fact,
           been interpreting accurately.   I  had  no  reason  to  conclude
           otherwise.  I required to give a stern warning to those  in  the
           Court, including the First  Appellant,  that  they  required  to
           remain silent or they would  be  ejected  from  the  proceedings
           throughout the duration of the Second Appellant giving evidence.

       30.    The First and Second Appellants claimed that  their  children
           only have a basic understanding  of  spoken  Mongolian  and  are
           unable to read and write in the language.  I do  not  find  this
           credible.  Their eldest child, the Third Appellant, was 4� years
           old when he came to the United Kingdom.  Whilst  the  First  and
           Second Appellants can speak some English their primary  language
           is Mongolian and as such they required an  interpreter  for  the
           purposes of the proceedings.  Whilst  the  Third  Appellant  has
           been attending school in England and will now no doubt be fluent
           in speaking, reading and writing in  English,  there  is  little
           doubt that he  will  have  a  good  understanding  of  Mongolian
           language.  Whilst the Fourth Appellant who is now  8  has  never
           lived in Mongolia, I do not accept that he has not whilst living
           in  the  same  family  unit  as  the  First,  Second  and  Third
           Appellants acquired a knowledge of Mongolian language  which  is
           being spoken in the household.

       31.    In addition  to  considering  the  Third,  Fourth  and  Fifth
           Appellants' welfare as a primary consideration generally, I have
           had specific regard to the cases of EV (Philippines) &  Ors  -v-
           Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ  874,
           E-A (Article 8 - best interests of child)  Nigeria  [2011]  UKUT
           00315 (IAC), Azimi-Moayed & Ors (decisions  affecting  children;
           onward  appeals)  [2013]  UKUT  00197  (IAC),  and  Zoumbas  -v-
           Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] UKSC 74.

       32.    I have approached the consideration of the Third, Fourth  and
           Fifth Appellants' circumstances with regards to the Rules in the
           way which I am required to do for the  purposes  of  considering
           their circumstances in a standalone way outwith  the  Rules  for
           the purposes of Article 8 of the European  Convention  on  Human
           Rights.  This  appears  to  be  the  appropriate  thing  to  do.
           Consideration of whether it is  reasonable  for  the  Third  and
           Fourth Appellants to leave the United Kingdom for  the  purposes
           of the Rules (either  paragraph  276ADE  or  paragraph  EX.1  of
           Appendix FM) require careful  consideration  of  all  facts  and
           circumstances and the carrying out of a proportionality test.

       33.    The Third and Fourth  Appellants  have  been  in  the  United
           Kingdom and have lived continuously here for at least  7  years.
           Subparagraph (iv) of paragraph  276ADE  and  the  provisions  of
           paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM require me  to  determine  whether
           "it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave  the
           UK".

       34.    The Fifth Appellant is only some 18  months  old  and  cannot
           benefit from the Rules.   The  Fifth  Appellant's  circumstances
           have to  be  considered  outwith  the  Rules.   The  Appellants'
           representative did not place much weight upon the  circumstances
           of the Fifth Appellant being a particularly persuasive factor in
           my decision-making and instead encouraged me to focus  upon  the
           circumstances of the Third and Fourth Appellants.

       35.    In coming to a determination for the purposes of subparagraph
           (iv) of paragraph 276ADE and provision EX.1 of Appendix  FM  and
           establishing whether it is reasonable or not to expect the Third
           and Fourth Appellants to leave the UK, I have carried out a full
           examination of all the circumstances pertaining to the Third and
           Fourth Appellants and looked at all  the  circumstances  of  the
           children including, for the purposes  of  consideration  of  the
           Article 8 considerations the steps set out in Razgar.

       36.    So far as the Fifth Appellant is concerned,  I  am  satisfied
           that I ought to consider their circumstances under article 8  as
           no Immigration Rule is applicable.  Given his young  and  tender
           years, he is undoubtedly primarily focused upon himself and  his
           immediate family, in particular the First and Second Appellants.
            He has not begun to  establish  any  meaningful  private  life.
           There would be no breach of the ECHR by  his  removal  with  his
           parents.

       37.    In considering whether it would be reasonable for  the  Third
           and Fourth Appellants to leave the United  Kingdom,  I  consider
           and compare their continued residence here in the  UK  in  their
           family unit with the other alternative.  The  other  alternative
           does not involve them relocating to Mongolia on  their  own  but
           instead as part of the family unit which they are familiar  with
           and part of with their parents, the First and Second Appellants,
           and their younger brother the Fifth Appellant.

       38.    I conclude that the Third and Fourth Appellants are adaptable
           to relocation in Mongolia.  It is their  best  interests  to  be
           cared for by their parents.  It is reasonable  that  they  leave
           the UK.  The evidence available suggests that they are  sociable
           children who  will  be  able  to  develop  new  friendships  and
           relationships outwith their immediate family without difficulty.
            On the basis of my conclusions  they  will  have  a  sufficient
           understanding of  the  Mongolian  language  to  enable  them  to
           integrate into Mongolian  society  without  difficulty.   Whilst
           they are unlikely to be educated in English, they will  be  able
           to  continue   their   education   in   Mongolia   without   any
           prohibitions.   School  education  is  available  in   Mongolia.
           English is taught in secondary schools.  Tertiary  education  is
           available.  The skills and hence ability to earn a living by the
           First and Second Appellants will support the Third,  Fourth  and
           Fifth Appellants in their  education.   They  do  not  have  any
           health problems or special  educational  needs  or  require  any
           special provision in terms of their care or education.

       39.    I accept that the Third, Fourth and Fifth  Appellants  should
           not be punished for the wrong actions taken  by  the  First  and
           Second Appellants to remain in the United Kingdom illegally  and
           to evade Immigration Authorities for a long period of  time.   I
           do not believe that their relocation to Mongolia  would  be  any
           form of punishment.  Whilst educational provision may not be  of
           the same high calibre as that which they could benefit  from  in
           the UK, there are no risks of harm or  serious  detriment  which
           can be reasonably anticipated on the basis of  the  evidence  in
           respect of their physical, emotional or educational well-being.

       40.    The Fourth Appellant  is  currently  continuing  his  primary
           school  education.   He  is  not  at  a  crucial  stage  of  his
           education.  He has friends but his existing private life is  not
           such that there would be any harsh effects of  a  relocation  at
           his  age.   The  arguments  around  the  current  timing  of   a
           relocation to Mongolia for the Third Appellant is more carefully
           balanced given that he is at secondary school and will  be  aged
           14 later this year.  Again  friendships  and  interests  can  be
           pursued of new in Mongolia.  The Third Appellant is not  due  to
           imminently be presented for any formal educational  certificates
           or qualifications.  He spent some years  before  coming  to  the
           United Kingdom in Mongolia.  He  will  have  some,  albeit  aged
           memories of his time spent there.  His knowledge of English will
           no doubt assist and promote his future well-being and ability to
           achieve in Mongolia.

       41.    The First and Second Appellants are  undoubtedly  loving  and
           caring parents to the Third, Fourth and Fifth Appellants.  There
           is no suggestion that they are unable to meet the basic needs of
           the Third, Fourth and Fifth Appellants well.  It is most  likely
           that the First and Second Appellants would obtain  accommodation
           and employment over a short period  of  time  in  the  event  of
           returning to Mongolia.  It is reasonably  foreseeable  and  most
           likely that the Appellants together would continue in  a  loving
           family unit  of  five  in  Mongolia  with  no  serious  hardship
           arising.   The  First  and  Second  Appellants   have   parental
           responsibilities  to  promote  the  welfare  of  their  children
           wherever they may be and they will be able to readily assist  in
           ensuring the Third, Fourth and Fifth Appellants  form  ties  and
           integrate in Mongolian society utilising their own knowledge and
           experiences.

       42.    For the purposes of subparagraph (iv) of paragraph 276ADE and
           the  provisions  of  EX.1  of  Appendix  FM,  it  has  not  been
           established on the basis of the evidence that it  would  not  be
           reasonable to expect the Third and Fourth  Appellants  to  leave
           the United Kingdom.  For the same reasons which I set out, it is
           not disproportionate for the Respondent to have  concluded  that
           the Third and Fourth Appellants be removed from the UK.

       43.    As I have already indicated so far as the Third,  Fourth  and
           Fifth Appellants are  concerned,  I  have  carried  out  a  full
           consideration of their circumstances including the provision  of
           the  Rules  for  the  Third  and  Fourth  Appellants  but   also
           considering their circumstances along with those  of  the  Fifth
           Appellant outwith the Rules.  There were no compelling or  other
           reasons to consider the circumstances of the  First  and  Second
           Appellants outwith the Rules.

       44.    None of the Appellants are British citizens.   They  have  no
           right to future education  and  health  care  in  this  country.
           Section 117B sets out the public interest  considerations  which
           must be taken into account for the purposes of Article 8 in  all
           cases.   Little  weight  should  be  given  to  a  private  life
           established by a person at a time when the person's  immigration
           status is precarious.  Through no fault of their own, the Third,
           Fourth and Fifth Appellants' ability to  remain  in  the  United
           Kingdom throughout their lives has always  been  doubtful.   The
           Fourth and Fifth Appellants happened to be born in the UK during
           a period when their parents were here without authority.

The grant of permission and the grounds

12. Judge Astle considered it arguable that  the  judge  gave  insufficient
    consideration to the private life of the third  appellant,  the  likely
    language difficulties for the third and  fourth  appellants  and  their
    best interests.  She said that all the grounds may be argued.

13. There were three grounds of appeal.

14.  Ground  1  was  that  the  judge  erred  in  his  assessment  of   the
    reasonableness of relocation by the  third  and  fourth  appellants  by
    taking into account that the children would be returning as part  of  a
    family unit with their parents and that this  would  render  relocation
    reasonable.  It is contended that, as para  276ADE  is  concerned  with
    private life and not family life, the fact of return of a child in  the
    company of its parents does not diminish the extent of the interference
    with the child's own  private  life,  as  distinct  from  family  life,
    established in the UK.  Accordingly, it is contended that the  starting
    point for the consideration of para 276ADE in relation to the third and
    fourth appellants ought not to have been the  fact  that  the  children
    would be returning to Mongolia with their parents.

15. In any event, Judge Mill erroneously concluded at [30] and  [38],  that
    the children will have knowledge of the Mongolian  language  sufficient
    to be taught in that language and that their  education  would  not  be
    disrupted.  The judge erred in concluding, at [38], that,  using  their
    "sufficient" understanding of the language, they would  integrate  into
    Mongolian society without difficulty.

16. In relation to the third appellant,  the  judge  erroneously  concluded
    that he would have memories  of  living  in  Mongolia.  In  any  event,
    according to the  judge's  own  assessment  of  the  facts,  the  third
    appellant would have been more focused on his parents at the  time  and
    would not have started to engage with the community or education system
    in that country. The judge  failed  to  direct  his  attention  to  the
    principles in Azimi-Moayed  &  Others  (decisions  affecting  children;
    onward appeals) [2013] UKUT 00187 (IAC) and failed to consider,  rather
    than just refer, to the case of E-A (Article  8  -  best  interests  of
    children) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00315 (IAC).  In Azimi-Moayed, the  court
    clearly considered that the seven-year period from the age of  4  years
    is likely to be more significant.

17. There was no assessment of the third appellant's private life  save  to
    say that he was not undertaking any  formal  examinations.   The  judge
    referred to the third appellant's involvement with the Royal Air  Force
    Cadets which demonstrated that his social  ties  had  clearly  extended
    beyond his family unit and school community.

18. Accordingly, ground 1 contends that the judge had failed to  adequately
    demonstrate that he had engaged with the evidence regarding  the  third
    and fourth appellants' individual private lives and adequately assessed
    whether relocation would actually be in their best interests and  would
    promote their welfare.

19. Ground 2 concerned the judge's  assessment  of  the  first  and  second
    appellants' loss of ties to Mongolia.   It  is  asserted  that,  having
    regard to the length of time the first and second appellants  had  been
    away from Mongolia, he erred in his assessment of  their  abilities  to
    financially support their children in  Mongolia  and  their  continuing
    ties to Mongolia. His findings that the couple would be able to sustain
    a family of five and obtain housing and financial support  was  equally
    flawed in the light of the lapse of time since they  left  the  country
    and the fact that they had undertaken  menial  jobs  whilst  living  in
    Mongolia.

20. Ground 3 was that the judge had erred in his assessment  of  s.117B  of
    the 2002 Act.  Section 117B states that little weight should  be  given
    to private life that is established by a person  at  a  time  when  the
    person's immigration status was precarious.  It is contended that it is
    evident, from consideration of s.117B(6), that s.117B(4) and (5), which
    the judge considered, do not relate to children.   Even  if  precarious
    private life established by an adult may attract  little  weight  under
    s.117B, s.117B(6) states that the public interest does not require  the
    removal of an adult if he or she has established a genuine relationship
    with a child resident in the UK for more  than  seven  years.   In  his
    consideration of the reasonableness of the third and fourth  appellants
    relocating to Mongolia, the judge had failed to direct his attention to
    s.117B(6).

21. Further, or in the  alternative,  it  is  contended  that  the  judge's
    finding at [45] of the determination, that the children would  continue
    to be a significant burden on  taxpayers  due  to  the  requirement  to
    continue to educate them, was austere and flawed.   If  the  appellants
    were  granted  leave  to  remain,  they  would  be  able  to  make  the
    appropriate contributions as they would become self-sufficient like any
    other persons residing in the UK lawfully.

22. In addition, the judge's findings were "at odds with" the terms of  the
    United Nations Convention on the Rights of  the  Child  1989  ("UNCRC")
    which, inter alia, requires  state  parties  to  take  all  appropriate
    measures to "ensure that the child is protected against  all  forms  of
    discrimination or punishment on the basis of  the  status,  activities,
    expressed opinions, or beliefs of the child's parents, legal guardians,
    or family members".

Submissions at the hearing

23. As stated at [9] above, Mr Wilding and Ms Nnamani agreed that the judge
    had used the wrong version of para 276ADE(vi) in relation to the  first
    and second appellants  and  that,  if  I  concluded  that  he  did  not
    materially err in law in considering whether  they  satisfied  the  "no
    ties" stipulation in the previous version of para 276ADE(vi), the error
    in applying the wrong version of para 276ADE(vi) would not be material.



24. Ms Nnamani explained that the thrust of ground 1 was that the judge had
    erred in failing to focus on the private lives established by the third
    and fourth appellants in the United  Kingdom.   Instead,  his  starting
    point in assessing the private lives of the third and fourth appellants
    was that they would be returning to Mongolia with  their  parents.   In
    relation to the third appellant, he erroneously focused on whether  the
    third  appellant's  memories  of  Mongolia  would  assist  him  to  re-
    integrate, whether the fact that he had been born in Mongolia and  came
    to the United Kingdom at the age of 4� years would  be  of  assistance,
    and whether his education could be continued in Mongolia.   Ms  Nnamani
    submitted that the fact that the third appellant had some knowledge  of
    the Mongolian language cannot diminish the private  life  that  he  has
    established in the United Kingdom.

25. I asked Ms Nnamani to draw my attention to the evidence that was before
    the judge about the private lives established by the third  and  fourth
    appellants in the United Kingdom.  She referred me  to  the  fact  that
    there were birth certificates for each of the children in the  bundles.
    On examining the file at the hearing, I found the following material:

      i) In relation to the third appellant, a  letter  dated  19  September
         2013 from Quintin Kynaston Community Academy confirming that he  is
         a student in  full-time  education  at  the  academy,  having  been
         admitted into year 7 on 4 September 2012.  (Since  the  hearing,  I
         have seen a letter dated 20 May  2015,  at  page  32  of  a  bundle
         submitted under cover of a letter dated 27 May 2014, that says  the
         same thing).

     ii) In relation to the third and fourth appellants, a letter  dated  20
         September 2013 from Gateway  Primary  School  confirming  that  the
         third appellant had attended the school from 5 June 2006  until  20
         July 2012 and that the fourth appellant was attending  the  Gateway
         Academy, formerly the Gateway School,  and  had  done  so  since  9
         September 2010.  (Since the hearing, I have seen a letter dated  20
         May 2015, at page 31 of a bundle submitted under cover of a  letter
         dated 27 May 2014, that says the same thing).

    iii) In relation to the third appellant, a  letter  dated  26  September
         2014  from  Quintin  Kynaston  School  congratulating   the   third
         appellant on successfully securing a place on  the  Junior  Prefect
         team.

     iv) In relation to the third appellant, a letter dated 17 November 2014
         from Royal Air Force Air Cadets confirming that he was a member  of
         the 4F Hampstead Squadron and had been since 15 September 2014.

      v) Three photographs of the third appellant  with  colleagues  in  the
         Royal Air Force Air Cadets.

     vi) In relation to the third appellant, a certificate dated  July  2014
         issued by Quintin Kynaston for his efforts in drama.

26. There were no witness  statements  from  the  children  and  no  school
    reports.  However, there were witness statements  from  the  first  and
    second appellants stating, inter alia, that all  of  the  children  had
    formed relationships with children at school and in the  community  and
    that the children do not know any culture other than the culture in the
    UK.

27. Ms Nnamani acknowledged that the judge had referred to the letter  from
    the Royal Air Force Air Cadets at [13] of the determination.   However,
    she submitted that he failed to take it into account in his  assessment
    at [22] onwards.

28. Ms Nnamani submitted that, even if the third and fourth appellants have
    a working knowledge of the Mongolian language, this does not mean  that
    they can be educated in the Mongolian  language.   The  judge  did  not
    fully assess the facets of the private lives of the  third  and  fourth
    appellants.  The assessment of their best interests was flawed.  He did
    not consider whether it would be in their best interests to  return  to
    Mongolia.

29. Ground 2 challenged the judge's assessment of the "no ties" stipulation
    in para 276ADE(vi) in relation to  the  first  and  second  appellants.
    When the first and second appellants were last in  Mongolia,  they  had
    one child.  They now have three children.  The question was whether the
    judge had taken into account or was aware of all the  relevant  factors
    and whether they had been properly considered.

30. Ms Nnamani accepted that ground  2  may  be  a  disagreement  with  the
    judge's conclusion.  When pressed, she confirmed that ground  2  was  a
    rationality challenge.

31. Ms Nnamani submitted that s.117B(5) does not apply to children.  In  ZH
    (Tanzania), the House of Lords held that children should not be  blamed
    for the actions of their  parents.   It  was  therefore  unlikely  that
    s.117B(5) would apply to children.  The judge's findings, at  [44]  and
    [45], that the children will continue to be  a  significant  burden  on
    taxpayers due to the requirement to continue to  educate  them,  was  a
    very austere finding.

32. If the judge had directed his attention to s.117B(6), he would not have
    applied s.117B(5) to the children.

33. The finding that the children would be a burden on the education system
    was also flawed because, if the  appellants  are  granted  leave,  they
    would be able to make appropriate contributions.  At  [28],  the  judge
    had found that the first and second appellants had  been  working.   Ms
    Nnamani submitted that, if they were granted leave, it would be strange
    that they would be unable to take care of  themselves  financially  and
    maintain their children.

34. Ms Nnamani submitted that, at [44], the judge may have said that little
    weight was attached to the children's private lives. She  asked  me  to
    draw the inference that he had attached little weight  to  the  private
    lives of the third and fourth appellants.  She submitted  that  he  was
    wrong to do so.

35. In relation to the UNCRC, Ms Nnamani submitted that the judge erred  in
    referring to the fact that the children are not  British  citizens  and
    therefore have no right to future education and healthcare in  the  UK.
    In doing so, he had unlawfully discriminated against  the  children  on
    the grounds of their immigration status, contrary to the UNCRC.

36. I informed Mr Wilding that I did not need to hear  from  him,  save  in
    relation to Ms  Nnamani's  submissions  on  s.117B(5)  and  whether  it
    applies to children.

37. Mr Wilding submitted that s.117B(5)  applies  to  adults  and  children
    alike.  It applies in the assessment of an Article 8  claim  under  the
    Immigration Rules as well as outside the Immigration Rules. It  applies
    in deciding whether it is reasonable for  children  to  relocate  under
    para 276ADE(iv). Mr Wilding submitted that s.117B(5) does  not  detract
    from ZH (Tanzania).  He drew my attention  to  MK  (best  interests  of
    children) India [2011] UKUT 00475 (IAC), the Upper  Tribunal  said,  at
    [25]  that  "it  is  quite  clear  from  leading  cases,  including  ZH
    (Tanzania), that factors such as citizenship and immigration status can
    sometimes strengthen, sometimes weaken,  the  argument  that  the  best
    interests of the child lie in remaining in the United Kingdom".

38. However, Mr Wilding submitted that the  judge  had  not  followed  this
    approach.  He only considered s.117B  outside  the  Immigration  Rules.
    This is because he considered it at [43].  Accordingly, any  error  was
    not material because his approach was generous to  the  appellants  and
    they still failed.

39. Mr Wilding submitted that, at [44], the judge said, "Section 117B  sets
    out the public interest considerations which must be taken into account
    for the purposes of Article 8 in all cases".  He then said "through  no
    fault of their own, the third, fourth and fifth appellants' ability  to
    remain in the United Kingdom throughout their  lives  has  always  been
    doubtful".  Mr Wilding submitted that this does not mean that the judge
    gave little weight to their private lives because of  their  precarious
    immigration  status.   At  [46],  the  judge  concluded  that  it   was
    reasonable for the third, fourth and fifth appellants to relocate.   He
    incorporated his finding as to reasonableness.  It was a fact that  the
    ability of the third, fourth and fifth  appellants  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom had always been doubtful.

40. In relation to the argument that the judge's finding  that  the  third,
    fourth and fifth appellants if they remain in the United Kingdom,  will
    continue to be a significant burden on taxpayers due to the requirement
    to continue to educate them was austere, Mr Wilding submitted that this
    was a facet of the public interest which the judge was entitled to take
    into account.

41. At [11] of the judgment in FK (Botswana) v Secretary of State  for  the
    Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 238, Sir Stanley Burnton said:
        "The second reason is that the maintenance of  immigration  control
        is not an aim that is implied for the purposes of article 8.2.  Its
        maintenance is necessary in order to  preserve  or  to  foster  the
        economic well-being of the country, in order to protect health  and
        morals, and for the  protection  of  the  rights  and  freedoms  of
        others. If there were no immigration control, enormous  numbers  of
        persons would be able to enter this country, and would be  entitled
        to claim social security benefits, the  benefits  of  the  National
        Health Service, to be housed (or to compete for housing with  those
        in this country) and to compete for employment with  those  already
        here. Their children would  be  entitled  to  be  educated  at  the
        taxpayers' expense (as was the second appellant). All such  matters
        (and I do not suggest that they are the only  matters)  go  to  the
        economic well-being of the country. That the individuals  concerned
        in the present case are  law-abiding  (other  than  in  respect  of
        immigration controls) does not  detract  from  the  fact  that  the
        maintenance of a generally applicable immigration policy is, albeit
        indirectly, a legitimate aim for the purposes of article 8.2."

42.  Mr  Wilding  submitted  that  it  could  not   therefore   have   been
    discriminatory for the judge  to  have  taken  into  account  that  the
    education of the third, fourth and fifth appellants would be  a  burden
    on the taxpayer, given that the Court of Appeal found that the benefits
    of social security, the NHS, housing and receiving education go to  the
    economic wellbeing of the country which was a legitimate aim.

43. In response, Ms Nnamani submitted that the Tribunal held in AM (S 117B)
    Malawi [2015] UKUT0260 (IAC)  that  s.117B  only  applies  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.  It does not  apply  in  any  assessment  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

44. I pointed out that the judge had only  applied  s.117B  in  conjunction
    with his assessment outside the Immigration Rules.

45. Ms Nnamani submitted that it would be very strange for little weight to
    be attached to the private lives of children, bearing in mind the  Rule
    that, if a child has lived in the United Kingdom more than seven years,
    the issue is whether it would be reasonable for the child to  relocate.



46. I announced that there was no material error  of  law  in  the  judge's
    decision for reasons to be given in writing.

Assessment

47. I do not accept that the judge erred as contended in ground 1, for  the
    following reasons:

      i) The judge's determination has to be considered as  a  whole.   When
         considered as a whole, in particular from [22] onwards, it is plain
         and beyond doubt, in my judgement, that the judge accepted that the
         third and fourth appellants had established private  lives  in  the
         United Kingdom.  He referred in  terms  to  the  third  and  fourth
         appellants attending school in the UK. He  said  (at  [38]  at  his
         decision) that "the  evidence  available  suggests  that  they  are
         sociable children". He must therefore have had in mind the evidence
         before him that they were attending school and, in the case of  the
         third appellant, his activities with the Royal  Air  Force  Cadets,
         evidence which he had referred to at [13] of the  decision.  It  is
         difficult to see what else he could have been referring to at [38].
         In relation to the  fifth  appellant,  he  said  (at  [36]  of  his
         decision) that he had not begun to establish any meaningful private
         life in the UK because, given his tender age,  he  was  undoubtedly
         primarily  focused  upon  himself  and  his  immediate  family,  in
         particular, the first  and  second  appellants.  He  was  therefore
         distinguishing the  fifth  appellant  from  the  third  and  fourth
         appellants and, in doing so, stating (although not in  terms)  that
         the third and fourth appellants had established  private  lives  in
         the UK.

     ii) I therefore  reject  the  contention  that  the  judge  erroneously
         started his assessment of the private life claims of the third  and
         fourth appellants by considering whether they would be returning to
         Mongolia with their parents.

    iii) In any event, there was almost  a  dearth  of  evidence  about  the
         private life of the fourth appellant apart from the  fact  that  he
         was attending school, as is evident from [25] above, evidence which
         the judge plainly considered.  There was a little more evidence  in
         relation to the third appellant, but even this was limited.   There
         were no witness statements from the children and no school reports.
          The witness statements of the first and second appellants did  not
         say much about the quality of the private lives of  the  third  and
         fourth appellants beyond what the judge had dealt with. The parents
         said that their children were only aware of the culture in  the  UK
         and had developed ties with friends and the  community.  The  judge
         said that they were sociable children who will be able  to  develop
         new  friends  and  relationships  outside  their  immediate  family
         without difficulty. That shows  that  he  took  into  account  such
         evidence as was before him about their private lives in the UK.

     iv) I do not  accept  that  the  judge  failed  to  consider  the  best
         interests of the third and  fourth  appellants.   At  [21]  of  the
         determination,  he  summarised  ZH  (Tanzania),  stating  that  the
         principle that the best interests of children as a  starting  point
         must be considered in the proportionality assessment was  reflected
         within s.55 and that he had borne this in mind  throughout  in  his
         decision-making.  At [31], he again referred to  the  cases  of  EA
         and Azimi-Moayed referring to the welfare of the third, fourth  and
         fifth appellants as a primary consideration generally.

      v) The remainder of ground 1 amounts to no more  than  a  disagreement
         with the reasoning of the judge and his findings.   The  judge  was
         fully entitled to take into account  the  fact  that  the  children
         would be returning to Mongolia with their parents.  He was entitled
         to take into account that the third appellant will have some memory
         of Mongolia which will assist him  and  that  both  the  third  and
         fourth appellants will have the support of  their  parents  who  he
         found to be undoubtedly loving and caring.

48. I can dispose of ground 2 in brief  terms.  Ms  Nnamani  accepted  that
    ground 2 was a rationality challenge, the threshold for which is  high.
    The judge was plainly aware that the first and  second  appellants  had
    had only one child to support in Mongolia  when  they  were  living  in
    Mongolia and that they now have three children to support.   It  simply
    cannot be said that his finding that the first  and  second  appellants
    will be able to sustain themselves and their children is irrational.

49. In relation to ground 3, Mr Wilding and  Ms  Nnamani  addressed  me  at
    length on the question whether s.117B(5) applies in  an  assessment  of
    the Article 8 claims of children.  Mr Wilding submitted that  s.117B(5)
    applies to any assessment under the Immigration Rules as  well  as  any
    assessment of an Article 8 claim outside the Immigration Rules, whereas
    Ms Nnamani submitted that the Upper Tribunal had  held  in  AM  Malawi)
    that s.117B only applies  to  an  assessment  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules.

50. I am inclined to the view that Mr Wilding is  correct,  that  s.117B(5)
    applies in assessing any claim, whether under the Immigration Rules  or
    outside the Immigration Rules and whether  the  assessment  relates  to
    children or adults. S.117B(5) is not limited in its terms to adults  or
    to assessments carried out under the Immigration Rules.  By  virtue  of
    s.117A(2), the court or tribunal must have regard to the considerations
    listed in s.117B "in all cases" when  it  is  considering  "the  public
    interest question" which  is  defined  in  s.117B(3)  as  meaning  "the
    question of whether an interference with a person's  right  to  respect
    for private and family life is justified under Article 8 (2)".

51. It is axiomatic that no Article 8 claim can succeed unless, in carrying
    out the  balancing  exercise  that  is  part  of  proportionality,  the
    conclusion  is  reached  that  the  decision  in  question   would   be
    disproportionate. The guidance of the  Upper  Tribunal  in  AM  to  the
    effect that s.117B only applies outside  the  Immigration  Rules  would
    mean that, in a case in which it is decided that it is unreasonable for
    a child to relocate under EX.1 (a) or para 276ADE(iv), this  conclusion
    would have been reached  without  any  public  interest  considerations
    having been considered at all, with the result that the Article 8 claim
    of the  child  will  have  succeeded  without  any  proportionality  or
    balancing exercise having been conducted at all. That simply cannot  be
    correct.  To my knowledge, there is  no  example  in  any  domestic  or
    Strasbourg cases where it is has been held  that  an  Article  8  claim
    succeeds without  the  circumstances  of  the  individual  having  been
    balanced against the state's interests.

52. Having said that, the point is not of material relevance in this  case.
    This  is  because  the  judge  only  took  into  account   the   s.117B
    considerations in relation to his assessment of the claim  outside  the
    Immigration Rules. He did not take it into account in deciding  whether
    it was reasonable for the third and fourth appellants  to  relocate  to
    Mongolia. This much is clear from the fact that,  having  assessed  the
    claims of the third and fourth appellants under para 276ADE(iv) of  the
    Immigration Rules and stated his conclusion in that regard at [42],  he
    turned to consider the position outside the Immigration Rules at  [44]-
    [46]. It was only at [44]-[46]  that  he  referred  to  s.117B.  It  is
    therefore plain that he only considered s.117B outside the  Immigration
    Rules, which was generous to the third and fourth appellants,  and  yet
    they lost.

53. It simply cannot be inferred, as Ms Nnamani invited me to  infer,  that
    the judge at [44] of his decision gave little  weight  to  the  private
    lives of the third and fourth appellants.  There  is  nothing  in  [44]
    which says so in terms. Furthermore, at [44], the judge merely  made  a
    series of  factual  statements,  some  of  which  applied  to  all  the
    appellants and some to certain of them. It therefore simply  cannot  be
    said that the third sentence of [44] applied to all of the  appellants.



54. I turn to the argument that the judge's finding at [45] of his decision
    that the third, fourth and fifth appellants,  if  they  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom, will continue to be a significant burden  on  taxpayers
    due to the requirement to continue to educate them  is  austere.  I  am
    satisfied that there is no error of law in this regard.  This  argument
    is entirely hopeless, given paragraph 11 of the judgment of  the  Court
    of Appeal in FK (Botswana), quote at [41] above.

55. The final  argument  in  relation  to  ground  3  was  that  the  judge
    unlawfully  discriminated  against  the  children  in   holding   their
    immigration status against them.  Again, this argument is hopeless.  It
    is axiomatic that  the  immigration  laws  of  any  country  will  draw
    distinctions between those who have an immigration status in the United
    Kingdom and those who do not. It simply  cannot  be  discriminatory  to
    take into account that a child does not have an immigration  status  in
    the UK in order to reach a decision on proportionality. In  any  event,
    given that the Court of Appeal decided  that  the  benefits  of  social
    security, the NHS, Housing and receiving education are relevant to  the
    economic well-being of the UK, it cannot be discriminatory to take into
    account the fact that the children in this case  will  be  educated  at
    state expense if they are allowed  to  remain.  It  is  speculation  to
    suggest that, if allowed to remain,  their  parents  will  be  able  to
    contribute sufficiently to  the  tax  system  to  compensate  for  that
    expense, even if that were a valid argument which is not the case.

56. Accordingly, I have concluded that the judge did not err in  law.   The
    appeals to the Upper Tribunal are dismissed.

Upper Tribunal Judge Gill
