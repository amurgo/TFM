                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant is a female citizen of Jamaica born on 15th  March  1970.
    She applied for a residence card on the basis  that  her  son  [SM],  a
    British citizen, was dependent upon her.  That application was  refused
    for the reasons given in the Respondent's letter  of  17th  July  2013.
    The Appellant appealed and her appeal was heard by Judge of the  First-
    tier Tribunal Andrew (the Judge) sitting at Birmingham on 2nd  February
    2015.  She allowed the appeal for the reasons  given  in  her  Decision
    dated 12th February 2015.  The Respondent sought leave to  appeal  that
    decision, and on 5th May 2015 such permission was granted.

Error of Law

 2. I must first decide if the decision of the Judge contained an error  on
    a point of law so that it should be set aside.

 3. The Judge found that the Appellant had first arrived in the UK on  14th
    November 2002 when she had been granted six  months'  leave  to  enter.
    Thereafter she formed a relationship with [KM] and their son  [SM]  was
    born on [ ] 2003.  He had become a British citizen on 1st November 2011
    on the basis that his father had had indefinite leave to remain in  the
    UK.  The Judge heard evidence that the  Appellant's  relationship  with
    [KM] had come to an end in or about October 2009, and that he had  left
    their household in September 2011.  [KM] had then gone to Jamaica for a
    holiday and had not returned to the UK.  The Judge was not satisfied as
    to the credibility of this evidence, however, on the basis of  evidence
    consisting of letters from [SM]'s  school,  a  pastor,  and  a  medical
    practice the Judge found that the Appellant was [SM]'s  primary  carer,
    and that [KM] had not cared directly for [SM]  in  recent  years.   The
    Judge therefore found that if the Appellant was obliged  to  leave  the
    UK, she would go to Jamaica and that [SM] would have to  accompany  her
    there.  Therefore the Judge allowed the appeal under the provisions  of
    Regulation 15A(7) and  Regulation  18A  of  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006 as the Appellant had a derivative right
    to a residence card.

 4. At the hearing, Mrs Aboni referred to the grounds  of  application  and
    argued that the Judge had erred in law in finding that [SM] would  have
    to leave the UK on the removal of his mother.   The  evidence  did  not
    show this to be the case.  It was not sufficient merely  to  find  that
    the Appellant was [SM]'s primary carer.  Likewise it was not sufficient
    to find that [SM]'s father had not cared for him in recent times.

 5. In response, Mr Wilson submitted that there was no such error  of  law.
    The Judge had analysed all  of  the  relevant  evidence  and  had  made
    findings which she had explained and for which she had given sufficient
    reasons.  The Judge had made a clear finding that [SM]'s father was not
    in contact with him  at  all.   The  Judge  had  come  to  a  realistic
    assessment of the situation from the evidence before her.

 6. I find no error of law in the decision of the Judge which  therefore  I
    do not set aside.   The  Judge  carefully  analysed  all  the  relevant
    evidence before her and came to findings of fact which were open to her
    on that evidence and which she adequately explained.   It  was  not  in
    dispute that the Appellant was [SM]'s primary  carer.   That  much  was
    conceded by the Respondent in the refusal letter.  The Judge also found
    that regardless of whether [KM] had  returned  to  Jamaica,  in  recent
    times he had had no involvement with [SM] at all.  There was  therefore
    no prospect that he could become the primary carer should the Appellant
    be removed from the UK.  At paragraph 20 of  the  Decision,  the  Judge
    found that there was no one else who might become [SM]'s primary carer.
     The Judge therefore made no error of law in allowing the appeal.

Decision

 7. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

    I do not set aside that decision.

    The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

Anonymity

 8. The First-tier Tribunal did not make a direction for anonymity.  I  was
    not asked to do so and indeed find no reason to do so.
