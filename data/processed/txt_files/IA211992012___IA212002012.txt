                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Respondents (The Claimants), nationals of  India  born  8  February
    1977 and 27 March 1977 respectively applied for leave to remain in  the
    United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant and her  dependent
    husband  on  4  April  2012.   The  applications  were  refused   under
    paragraphs 245FD and  319C  of  the  immigration  rules  HC395C  on  21
    September 2012.

 2. The Claimants' appeals came before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Fisher
    who, on 12 December 2012, allowed their appeals under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 3. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal those decisions  and
    was granted leave by Designated Judge Peart of the First-tier  Tribunal
    on 4 January 2013.  The nub of the Secretary of  State's  argument  was
    that all documentation required to be provided must be provided by  the
    date of application by reason of the wording  of  paragraph  245FE  and
    Appendix A table 10 paragraphs 66 to 72 of the Immigration Rules HC 395
    as amended.

 4. It is to be noted from the notice of immigration decision for the first
    Claimant that the basis of her refusal was that the 15  points  claimed
    under Appendix A for the eligible qualification had not  been  provided
    when the application was first submitted on 4 April 2012.  Evidence  of
    the  award  of  the  eligible  qualification,  a  Masters  of  Business
    Administration, had been provided in June  2012.   The  claimed  points
    under Appendix B English language were refused due to  the  failure  to
    meet the  requirement for the  eligible  award.   The  failure  of  the
    second  Claimant's  application  was  solely  based  upon   the   first
    Claimant's claim having failed.

 5. On 15 January 2013 the Upper Tribunal dealt with the case of Khatel and
    others (s85A; effect of continuing application) [2013] UKUT  44  (IAC).
    The President of the Upper Tribunal concluded, on  an  application  for
    further leave to remain, for  example  for  Tier  1  (Post-Study  Work)
    Migrants, that so long as notice of an eligible award was given to  the
    Secretary of State after  the  date  when  the  application  was  first
    submitted but before the Secretary of State's decision was made on  the
    application then the  requirements  of  table  10  of  the  Rules  were
    satisfied. The Tribunal's reasoning was  that  the  application  was  a
    continuing one until a decision upon it had been made.

 6. It is clear from the Secretary of  State's  decision  that  notice  was
    given before the date of decision that  the  appropriate  qualification
    had been obtained by the first Claimant.  In  those  circumstances  the
    reasoning provided by the First-tier Tribunal Judge was wrong  in  law,
    in the application of AQ (Pakistan) (2011)  EWCA  Civ  833  albeit  the
    conclusion was correct. The Secretary of State's decision  was  reliant
    upon the cases of  NO  (Post  Study  Work-  Award  needed  by  date  of
    application(2009) UKAIT 00054 (IAC)  and AQ above simply do not at  the
    moment have any substance to support the argument that  the  date  when
    the application was first submitted is the only relevant date.

 7.  Given the facts set out above and the case  of  Khatel  we  found  the
    first Claimant had discharged the burden  of  proof  on  a  balance  of
    probabilities that she was entitled to the points claimed.  It  follows
    the appeal of the second Claimant, as a family dependent under the PBS,
    also succeeded.

 8. The Secretary of State's challenge to the Judge's decision is not  made
    out. The decision is that the  Claimants'  appeals  succeed  under  the
    immigration rules and the original Tribunal decisions stand.

 9.  The appeal by the Secretary of State under the  immigration  rules  is
    dismissed.
