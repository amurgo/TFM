            Before The Honourable Mr Justice McCloskey, President



    Having considered all papers lodged and having heard the submissions of
    Mr D O'Callaghan, of counsel, instructed by Duncan Lewis Solicitors, on
    behalf of the Applicant, and Mr J Eadie  QC  and  Miss  E  Wilsdon,  of

    the Respondent, at hearings at Field House, London on 07 March  and  21
    April 2017.




      i) The commonly used forms of consent order do not expose either party
         to possible contempt action or other sanction.


     ii) The remedy for non - compliance with a consent order will  normally
         be the initiation of a fresh judicial review claim












    McCloskey P




      Introduction

 1. In the events which have occurred this judicial  review  challenge  has
    become academic in the practical sense.  At this juncture  and  bearing
    in mind the context there is no  practical  and  effective  public  law
    remedy which could be granted to the  Applicant.  This  is  the  extant
    state of affairs by virtue of the Secretary of State, in  the  wake  of
    anterior judicial review proceedings,  having  made  a  fresh  decision
    which is now the subject  of  a  statutory  appeal  by  the  Applicant.
    However, these are public law proceedings and, for reasons  which  will
    become apparent, I give effect to the principle enunciated by the House
    of Lords in R v Secretary of State for the Home  Department,  ex  parte
    Salem [1999] 1 AC 450 at 453 per Lord Slynn, namely that where there is
    no longer a live  lis  inter-partes  there  is  a  judicial  discretion
    whether to proceed, the governing criterion being that  of  the  public
    interest, in the following way.

 2. This case raises certain questions, of both substantive and  procedural
    law, relating to the void  which  is  created  in  circumstances  where
    judicial review proceedings are settled by an  approved  consent  order
    pursuant to which the Secretary of State is required to  make  a  fresh
    decision subject to a time limit which expires subsequently without the
    further decision having been made.  This I considered to be in an issue
    of sufficient moment to warrant the perpetuation of  these  proceedings
    so as to receive oral and written argument with a view to  promulgating
    guidance within  reasonable  limits.   I  record  and  acknowledge  the
    cooperation and assistance provided by the parties' representatives  in
    this exercise.




    The Litigation Framework

 3. The occasion for considering these issues arises in the  context  of  a
    judicial review challenge brought by MMK ("the Applicant") against  the
    Secretary of State for the Home Department ("the Secretary of  State").
    The Applicant's challenge was not untypical.   It  was  directed  to  a
    decision of  the  Secretary  of  State  refusing  to  consider  certain
    submissions as a fresh asylum, humanitarian protection or human  rights
    claim, applying paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules.  Permission  to
    apply for judicial review not having been determined, the  outcome  was
    fairly routine.  It entailed a concession on behalf of the Secretary of
    State at the Acknowledgement of Service ("AOS") stage giving rise to  a
    consent order which the Tribunal duly approved.

 4.  The  terms  of  the  consent  order  will  be  readily  recognised  by
    practitioners and Judges alike:

    "UPON THE RESPONDENT agreeing to withdraw  the  decision  letter  of  6
    October 2015 refusing to consider the Applicant's  further  submissions
    received on 14 March 2012, 5 November 2014 and 25 February  2015  as  a
    fresh asylum, humanitarian protection or human rights claim;

    AND UPON THE APPLICANT agreeing within 21 days of the sealing  of  this
    order, to submit further material in support  of  his  application  for
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom or notifying the Respondent  that
    he does not intend to submit any further material;

    AND UPON THE  RESPONDENT  agreeing  to  make  a  new  decision  on  the
    Applicant's application for leave to remain, including consideration of
    the material submitted by the Applicant  during  the  course  of  these
    proceedings within 3 months of  receipt  of  the  further  material  or
    notification that no further material is to be submitted.

    BY CONSENT, IT IS ORDERED THAT:

      1. The Applicant do have leave to  withdraw  the  claim  for  judicial
         review;.

      2. The Applicant's reasonable costs to be paid by the  Respondent,  to
         be assessed if not agreed; and

      3. There be a detailed assessment of the Applicant's Legal Aid  Agency
         costs."




    This order was sealed by the Tribunal.   In  short,  the  Secretary  of
    State agreed to make a new decision based upon, in  its  totality,  all
    extant material and any further material provided within  three  months
    of receipt of the latter.  Any  further  material  emanating  from  the
    Applicant was to be provided within 21 days of the sealing of the order
    viz by 05 May 2016.

 5. Thereafter the Applicant's  solicitors  made  further  representations,
    attaching new material, in the following two tranches:

       a) under cover of  a  letter  dated  05  May  2016  containing  quite
          detailed representations relating to the alleged  previous  threat
          concerning the Applicant in  Iran  on  account  of  his  political
          opinion and his sur place activities in  the  United  Kingdom  and
          enclosing a letter from a pastor describing the commitment of  the
          Applicant and  his  spouse  to  the  pastor's  church  during  the
          previous year; and




       b) under cover of a further letter dated 13 July 2016 which attached,
          and made representations relating to, a consultant  psychiatrist's
          report.




    This was followed by a reminder letter dated 31 August 2016 and a  more
    detailed letter of the same date, both emanating from  the  Applicant's
    solicitors.  The longer letter (which airbrushes the second tranche  of
    representations and  evidence  -  see  above)  contains  the  following
    material passages:




             "The Respondent has failed to act in accordance with the Order
             of 14 April  2016.   No  application  has  been  made  by  the
             Respondent to amend the Order so as to extend time ...




             An Order of the Upper Tribunal has been intentionally breached
             by one of the parties to the proceedings ...




             We request that a decision be made within  fourteen  days  ...
             otherwise the Applicant will return to the Upper Tribunal  and
             seek to very the present final Order so as  to  incorporate  a
             specified date by when a  decision  is  to  be  issued  and  a
             further Order which may indicate what might happen if there is
             any further failure to comply ..."




    Another reminder letter dated 13 September 2016 followed.




 6. The first response on behalf of the Secretary of State was made in  the
    form of a letter dated 26 September 2016.  This conveyed  an  intention
    to interview  the  Applicant  on  account  of  his  asserted  religious
    conversion and proposed that a written reply from the identified pastor
    to validate his letter of support (part of the new material  submitted)
    be provided.  This was duly received within three days, on 29 September
    2016.  The interview was ultimately held on 27 January 2017.  On behalf
    of the Secretary of State,  a  fresh  decision  was  then  made,  being
    contained in a letter dated 22 February 2017.  While the Applicant  did
    not, by this decision, secure the substantive  relief  he  was  seeking
    this was nevertheless an appealable decision and, at this  juncture,  a
    hearing before the First-tier Tribunal is pending.

 7. Thus, to summarise:

      i) Further representations and evidence were provided on behalf of the
         Applicant within the period specified in the Consent Order.

     ii) Still further representations and evidence were provided on  behalf
         of the Applicant some ten weeks  after  the  specified  period  had
         expired.

    iii) The time limit within which the Secretary of State was  to  make  a
         new decision was not met, on any showing.

     iv) The further evidence  requested  by  the  Secretary  of  State  was
         provided.

      v) The (previously unscheduled) Home Office further interview  of  the
         Applicant was duly held, some nine  months  following  the  Consent
         Oder.

     vi) The Secretary of State's fresh decision followed just under a month
         later.










    Procedural Developments

 8. On 13 November 2016 the Applicant's solicitors took the following step.
     They lodged with the UT an application for an order in  the  following
    terms:




         "The Applicant seeks to enforce the terms of the Order of the Upper
         Tribunal sealed on 14 April 2016 that  was  consented  to  by  both
         parties.  On 5 May 2016 the Applicant served  further  material  on
         the Respondent within 21 days  of  the  sealing  of  the  order  in
         accordance with the terms of the Order.  The Respondent had until 6
         August 2016 to make a decision.  No application has  been  made  by
         the Respondent to amend the terms of the  sealed  Order  so  as  to
         extend time in which to make the required decision.  The Respondent
         has not sought agreement with the Applicant as to the filing  of  a
         draft consent order so as  to  extend  time  in  which  to  make  a
         decision on a specified date.




         The Applicant seeks a variation  of  the  Order,  namely  that  the
         Respondent  issue  a  decision  by  a  stated  dated  and  for  the
         requirement of personal attendance by an agent or  servant  of  the
         Respondent to be added  to  the  Order  in  case  of  further  non-
         compliance."







    This elicited the following Order of the UT:




         "(1)     As the letter of application dated 28th November 2016 from
         Duncan Lewis indicates the proceedings were disposed of by  way  of
         Consent Order dated 6th April 2016 in  an  order  approved  by  the
         Upper Tribunal on 14th April 2016.  There is a timeframe within the
         order.




         (2)      It is open to the Applicant  to  commence  fresh  judicial
         review proceedings for an order of  mandamus  in  relation  to  the
         failure of the Secretary of State to issue a new decision and seeks
         costs."







 9. Undeterred, on 30 December 2016 the  Applicant's  solicitors  issued  a
    further Application Notice, in the following terms:




         "The Applicant seeks to enforce the terms of the Order sealed on 14
         April 2016 by seeking to reinstate the claim and to vary the  order
         so as to provide a time frame within which  the  Respondent  is  to
         issue a decision and the issue of costs.




         On  14  December  2016  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  [  ]  refused   the
         application for a variation of the order  without  considering  the
         application to reinstate the proceedings.  The  Applicant  requests
         an oral consideration of (i) his application to reinstate the claim
         and (ii) his application to vary the sealed Order of 14 April  2015
         so as to extend time  in  which  the  Respondent  is  to  make  the
         required decision and an order for costs."




    This was accompanied by a Draft Order in the following terms:







         "IT IS ORDERED THAT




         1. The application to  be  placed  before  a  Judge  of  the  Upper
             Tribunal within 24 hours.




         2. The application to be listed for an oral hearing  on  the  first
             available date on or after 5 January 2017 before the President
             of the Upper Tribunal.




         3. The issue of costs and wasted costs  to  be  considered  at  the
             hearing."







    This gave rise to a listing before me on 07 March 2017.  While this was
    a substantive listing it metamorphosed into a CMR and  I  gave  certain
    directions with  which  the  parties'  representatives  have  dutifully
    complied.




    The Legal Framework of Contempt

10. By virtue of section 3(5) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement  Act
    2007 (the "2007 Act"), the UT is a superior court of  record.   Section
    25, under the rubric  of  "Supplementary  powers  of  Upper  Tribunal",
    provides:

         "(1)     In relation to the matters mentioned  in  subsection  (2),
             the Upper Tribunal-

             (a) has, in England and Wales or in Northern Ireland, the same
                  powers, rights,  privileges  and  authority  as  the  High
                  Court, and


             (b) has, in Scotland, the same powers, rights, privileges  and
                  authority as the Court of Session.


         (2)      The matters are-


             (a) the attendance and examination of witnesses,


             (b  the production and inspection of documents, and


             (c) all other matters incidental to the Upper Tribunal's
                  functions.


                  [my emphasis]

         (3)      Sub-Section (1) shall not be taken-


             (a) to limit any power to make Tribunal Procedure Rules;


             (b)  to be limited by anything in Tribunal Procedure Rules
                  other than an express limitation."




    The key statutory words are "all other matters incidental to the  Upper
    Tribunal's functions".

11. The definition of "court" in Section 19 of the Contempt of Court Act
    1981 ("the 1981 Act") is -

         "............includes any tribunal or body exercising the  judicial
         power of the State".

    The definition of "superior court" is:

           "..........the Supreme Court, the  Court  of  Appeal,  the  High
           Court, the Crown Court, the [Court Martial Appeal Court]  ,  the
           Employment Appeal Tribunal and any  other  court  exercising  in
           relation to its proceedings powers equivalent to  those  of  the
           High Court."

      This clearly embraces  the  UT,  by  virtue  of  its  judicial  review
      jurisdiction.

12. Also to be noted is section 11 of the 1981 Act.  This provides:

       "In any case where a court (having power to do so) allows a  name  or
           other matter to be  withheld  from  the  public  in  proceedings
           before the court, the court may give such directions prohibiting
           the publication of that name or matter in  connection  with  the
           proceedings as appear to the  court  to  be  necessary  for  the
           purpose for which it was so withheld."

      Finally, by section 14 of the 1981 Act contempt  is  punishable  by  a
    maximum term of two years imprisonment or payment of a maximum fine  of
    �2,500.

    14.- Proceedings in England and Wales.

           (1) In any case where a court has power to commit  a  person  to
           prison for contempt of court and (apart from this provision)  no
           limitation applies to the period  of  committal,  the  committal
           shall (without prejudice to the power of the court to order  his
           earlier discharge) be for a fixed term, and that term shall  not
           on any occasion exceed two years in the case of committal  by  a
           superior court, or one month in the  case  of  committal  by  an
           inferior court.
           (2) In any case where an inferior court  has  power  to  fine  a
           person for contempt of court and (apart from this provision)  no
           limit applies to the amount of the fine, the fine shall  not  on
           any occasion exceed [�2,500].
           [(2A) In the exercise of jurisdiction to commit for contempt  of
           court or any kindred offence the court shall not deal  with  the
           offender by making an order under [section 60 of the  Powers  of
           Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act  2000]  (an  attendance  centre
           order) if  it  appears  to  the  court,  after  considering  any
           available evidence, that he is under 17 years of age.
            [(2A) A fine imposed under subsection (2) above shall be deemed,
           for the purposes of any enactment, to be a sum  adjudged  to  be
           paid by a conviction.
           (4) Each of the superior courts shall have  the  like  power  to
           make a hospital order or guardianship order under [section 37 of
           the Mental Health Act  1983]   [or  an  interim  hospital  order
           under]  [section 38 of that  Act]   in  the  case  of  a  person
           suffering from [mental disorder within the meaning of that  Act]
           who could otherwise be committed to prison for contempt of court
           as the Crown Court has under that  section  in  the  case  of  a
           person convicted of an offence.
           [(4A) Each of the superior courts shall have the like  power  to
           make an order under [section 35 of the said Act of 1983] (remand
           for report on accused's mental condition) where there is  reason
           to suspect that a person who could be committed  to  prison  for
           contempt of court is suffering from [mental disorder within  the
           meaning of that Act]  as the Crown Court has under that  section
           in the case of an accused person  within  the  meaning  of  that
           section.
           [(4A) For the purposes  of  the  preceding  provisions  of  this
           section [the county court shall be treated as a  superior  court
           and not as an inferior court.
           [(4B) The preceding provisions of this section do not  apply  to
           the family court, but-
           (a) this is  without  prejudice  to  the  operation  of  section
           31E(1)(a) of the Matrimonial and  Family  Proceedings  Act  1984
           (family court has High Court's powers) in relation to the powers
           of the High  Court  that  are  limited  or  conferred  by  those
           provisions of this section, and
           (b) section 31E(1)(b) of  that  Act  (family  court  has  county
           court's powers) does not apply in relation to the powers of  the
           county court that are limited or conferred by  those  provisions
           of this section.

13. In R (Cart) v Upper  Tribunal  and  Another  [2011]  QB  120  at  first
    instance, Laws LJ expressed the view that any superior court of  record
    - which includes the Upper Tribunal, per section 3(5) - has the  power,
    inter alia, to punish for contempt: see [75].  There is no  disapproval
    of this suggestion in the decision of the Court  of  Appeal.   And  see
    also Pickering v Liverpool Daily Post [1991] 2 AC 370, which held  that
    the law of contempt applies to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.

14. The contempt jurisdiction of the Upper Tribunal  was  exercised  in  AA
    (Involuntary Returns to Zimbabwe) [2005] UKAIT 144  in  preventing  the
    disclosure of the  identities  of  certain  information  in  a  country
    guidance  decision:  see  especially  [33].  Another  illustration   is
    provided by CB v Suffolk County Council [2010] UKUT 413 (AAC) where the
    UT fined a witness �500 for failing to attend a hearing in  the  First-
    Tier Tribunal (the "FtT") in  defiance  of  a  witness  summons.   This
    particular decision is a rare illustration of a reference made  by  the
    FtT to the UT under section 25 of  the  2007  Act,  a  provision  which
    reflects the status of  the  FtT  as  an  inferior  court.   A  similar
    illustration is provided by AP v Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (TC-
    Enforcement Reference) [2014] UKUT 182 (AAT).

15. There is a long-established  distinction  between  civil  contempt  and
    criminal contempt.  This is highlighted in, for example,  Lord  Saville
    of Newdigate v Harnden [2003] NI 239 and  [2003]  NICA  6.    It  seems
    clear that the powers of the UT belong to the realm of civil  contempt.
    While the misdemeanour  of  civil  contempt  can,  in  principle,  take
    various forms one of its most typical incarnations is disobedience by a
    party to a civil action, or a witness, of a specific order of the court
    or tribunal concerned:  see Attorney General v Times Newspapers  [1974]
    AC 273 at 307-8, per Lord Diplock.  Merely declaratory orders are  most
    unlikely to generate a finding of civil contempt.  This arises from the
    fundamental distinction between a mandatory order  and  a  declaration.
    This distinction is discussed  in  Family  Reunification  and  Judicial
    Review Remedies in  UTIAC,  Vol  2  JR  [2017].   See  also  Webster  v
    Southwark LBC [1983] QB 698.

16. A further well established principle is that the Crown is  immune  from
    contempt.  However, this does not extend to a Minister or  official  of
    the Crown or a Government Department: see M v Home Office [1994]  1  AC
    337 at 25 especially and Beggs v Scottish Ministers [2007] 1  WLR  455.
    Thus in principle the Secretary of State is vulnerable to a finding  of
    contempt by the UT.  In this context it is appropriate to highlight the
    heavy  emphasis  in  Beggs  on  common  law  fairness  and   procedural
    protections for every respondent/defendant in contempt proceedings.

17. Much of the law of contempt  in  the  United  Kingdom  is  judge  made,
    particularly prior to the advent of the 1981 Act.  The strict standards
    of  proof  applicable  are  noteworthy.   In  cases  of  alleged  civil
    contempt,  the  standard  of  proof  is  the  criminal  one  of  beyond
    reasonable doubt.  One discrete offshoot  of  this  principle  is  that
    service of the relevant judicial order on the  alleged  contemnor  must
    also be proven beyond reasonable doubt:  see  Churchman  v  Joint  Shop
    Stewards Committee of the Workers of the Port of London  [1972]  1  WLR
    1094, at 1098 per Lord Denning MR.

18. This  last  mentioned  principle  is  a  reflection  of  another  well-
    established principle, namely that the  contempt  jurisdiction  of  any
    court or tribunal is to be exercised with the  utmost  caution.   While
    this is expressed in, for example, Re Clements [1877] 46 LJ CH 375  per
    Jessel MR at 383, I would offer the observation that the concerns which
    exercised the Master of the Rolls so acutely viz committal for contempt
    being  "practically  arbitrary  and  unlimited"  belong  to  a  certain
    historical context and plainly have limited application to the world of
    contemporary litigation.



Procedural Considerations

19. The first procedural matter worthy of note is that in all  chambers  of
    the Upper Tribunal (the "UT") the withdrawal by a party of its case  or
    any part thereof requires the approval of the Tribunal: see rule 17  of
    the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  ("the  Rules").   I
    consider that rule 17 embraces  both  statutory  appeals  and  judicial
    review cases.  This analysis, in my view, is  unaffected  by  what  the
    specially tailored judicial review regime in the Rules - in  Part  4  -
    does, and does not, contain. Rule 17 coexists with  Rule  39(1),  which
    provides:

       "The Upper Tribunal may, at the request of the parties but only if it
           considers it appropriate, make a consent order disposing of  the
           proceedings and making such other appropriate provision  as  the
           parties have agreed."

                 [My emphasis.]

      Thus the UT is the arbiter of what every consent order contains.   Its
    powers in this context extend to rejecting a  draft  consent  order  in
    part, approving same in part and revising the  text.   An  exercise  of
    this kind could in theory result in the case proceeding to a hearing if
    the order ultimately acceptable to the Tribunal is not to the  parties'
    liking since, in  such  eventuality,  the  fundamental  requirement  of
    mutual consent would not be satisfied.

20. While the requirement of judicial approval of proposed withdrawals  and
    draft consent orders is especially apposite in the public law world  of
    the UT, it has also featured for many decades in the  sphere  of  civil
    litigation: see RSC Order 21 and its less intrusive modern incarnation,
    CPR Part 38, the main purpose being to prevent a  discontinuance  which
    would unfairly prejudice the defendant.   In the public law sphere this
    requirement is rooted in, inter  alia,  the  educative  and  corrective
    functions of the court or  tribunal  concerned.   It  reserves  to  the
    tribunal the right to reject a  proposed  withdrawal  in  circumstances
    where, for example, there is an important point of law or principle  or
    statutory   construction   deserving   of   judicial   exposition   and
    clarification: see by analogy the Judge made principle  underlying  the
    provision of this judgment, outlined in [1] above. It also provides  an
    important layer of protection to the litigant,  particularly  in  cases
    where there is  no  legal  representation.   Furthermore,  it  promotes
    procedural fairness and propriety and  serves  to  expose  and  prevent
    possible misuses of the Tribunal's process.

21. These reflections on procedural issues expose the fact that the UT does
    not have anything comparable to the regime contained in CPR 81  and  PD
    81 or Family Procedural Rules Part 37 and  PD  37.   In  passing,  this
    elaborate procedural regime invites the observation  that  there  is  a
    substantial merger of  the  common  law  principles  of  contempt,  the
    relevant statutory measures and  the  extant  procedural  rules.   This
    perspective per se provides a valuable  insight  into  the  subject  of
    contempt.  It also invites the observation that the sparse coverage  of
    this topic in the Rules and  the  extant  Presidential  Directions  may
    profitably be addressed  so  as  to  incorporate  a  discrete  contempt
    procedural regime.

22. It is stated in [25] of Presidential Guidance Note No 1/2013:

         "Where an anonymity order has been made but a person with knowledge
         of the order has breached it by  putting  the  information  in  the
         public domain, such conduct may be  punishable  as  a  contempt  of
         court either by the Upper Tribunal exercising  the  powers  of  the
         High Court under section 25 (2) (c) of the  Tribunals,  Courts  and
         Enforcement  Act  2007  or  by  any  other   court   of   competent
         jurisdiction."

This, in my estimation, is an accurate statement of the  powers  of  the  UT
    exercisable in the discrete sphere identified. However,  it  does  not,
    correctly in  my  view,  attempt  to  prescribe  the  procedure  to  be
    followed.  Matters of procedure fall within the remit of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure Committee: see section 22 of and Schedule 5 to the Tribunals,
    Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.

23. It is also necessary to draw attention to the  Direction  of  the  Lord
    Chief Justice under Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the  Constitutional  Reform
    Act 2005 and section 18 of the Tribunals, Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
    2007.  This prescribes the judicial review jurisdiction of this chamber
    of the UT.  By paragraph 1:


        "Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3 below, the Lord Chief Justice hereby
        specifies the following classes of case for the purposes of section
        18(6) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007:


           any application for permission to apply for judicial review  and
           any application for judicial review (including  any  application
           for ancillary relief and costs in such applications) that  calls
           into question:


             i. a decision made under the Immigration Acts  (as  defined  in
                Schedule 1 to the Interpretation Act 1978) or any instrument
                having effect (whether wholly or partly) under an  enactment
                within the Immigration Acts, or otherwise relating to  leave
                to enter  or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  outside  the
                Immigration Rules."


Paragraph 4 provides:


         "In paragraphs 1 and 3 above, the references to a decision  include
         references to any omission or failure to make a decision."

These provisions are germane to the correctness of the  UT  Order  noted  in
    [8] above.



Conclusions

24. The dust having settled in the wake of the parties'  responses  to  the
    Tribunal's most recent directions and via their admirably realistic and
    focussed oral submissions, the main value  of  this  judgment  lies  in
    drawing attention to the general principles, statutory  provisions  and
    procedural issues addressed above and the  provision  of  some  focused
    guidance infra.

25. The starting point is that noted in [1] above:  these  proceedings  are
    now academic.  If  the  UT  has  any  enduring  jurisdiction  in  these
    proceedings viz if it is competent to make  the  order  sought  by  the
    Applicant - see [9] above - there is plainly no  basis  for  doing  so.
    The further decision which the Secretary of State was  obliged  by  the
    Consent Order to make has now materialised.   The  Applicant  can  gain
    nothing from the perpetuation of these proceedings.

26. I consider, however, that there is a more fundamental obstacle  in  the
    Applicant's way.  I can identify no legal principle or procedural  rule
    supporting the contention that these  proceedings  have  some  enduring
    existence surviving the sealing of the Consent Order.  The  proceedings
    were withdrawn, with the  approval  of  the  UT.   Both  the  verb  "to
    withdraw"  and  its  derivatives,  adjectives  and  nouns  alike,   are
    unpretentious members of the English  language,  requiring  no  special
    construction within the realm of rule  17  of  the  2008  Rules.   They
    clearly convey and denote finality.  An approved consent  order  could,
    in principle, incorporate either basic or elaborate "liberty to  apply"
    provisions.  This one has no  such  content.   Furthermore,  a  consent
    order framed in the terms under scrutiny stands in clear contrast  with
    executory orders belonging to the sphere of private law, in  particular
    the Tomlin Order and the  Mareva  Order  and  the  classic  public  law
    executory remedy viz a mandatory order.

27. Next it is necessary to analyse the terms of the Consent Order.   These
    are divided into two sections.  The first consists  of  three  discrete
    paragraphs which employ the language of "Upon ..." and "And Upon  ...".
    The second section begins with the words "By consent it is ordered that
    ....  ",  followed  by  three  numbered  paragraphs.   I   accept   the
    correctness of the submission of Mr Eadie QC and Miss Wilsdon that  the
    first  three  paragraphs  of  the  order  are  properly   characterised
    recitals, whereas the three succeeding numbered paragraphs contain  the
    operative  parts  of  the  order.  Mr  O'Callaghan,  correctly  in   my
    estimation, did not advance any alternative analysis.  I  elaborate  on
    this as follows.

28. Neither the Applicant nor the Respondent was ordered by the  UT  to  do
    anything  with  reference  to  the  fresh   decision   making   process
    contemplated.  The only positive step ordered of the Secretary of State
    was to pay the Applicant's reasonable  costs.   I  construe  the  first
    section of the order as containing a series of mutual commitments of an
    aspirational nature, all made presumptively in good faith.

29. The next feature of the Consent Order appropriately highlighted is that
    the commitments assumed by both parties in the recitals were  expressed
    in relatively absolute terms and, in particular, made no provision  for
    unforeseen eventualities or circumstances.  In the event, both  parties
    failed to honour their respectively undertaken  commitments.   I  shall
    comment further on this infra.

30. It is also appropriate to emphasise that by the terms  of  the  Consent
    Order neither party made any undertakings to the  UT.   In  particular,
    the characterisation of undertakings does not apply  to  the  recitals.
    The correct analysis of the recitals is that they  record  the  factual
    basis of the  operative  provisions  of  the  order;  they  inform  and
    illuminate such provisions; and they give expression  to  the  parties'
    bona fide intentions. The interesting question of whether  recitals  of
    this kind operate to engender a substantive legitimate  expectation  is
    an issue which may fall to be determined in some future occasion.  As a
    minimum they impose a burden of explanation  on  the  defaulting  party
    where a default eventuates.  But they are neither undertakings  to  the
    Tribunal nor inter-partes contractual promises.

31. It follows from all of the foregoing that neither (a)  the  failure  on
    the part of  the  Applicant  to  submit  all  new  representations  and
    evidence within the agreed time limit nor (b) the failure on  the  part
    of the Secretary of State to make a  new  decision  within  the  agreed
    period of three months, beginning on the (implicitly extended) date  of
    receipt of the  second  tranche  of  material  noted  in  [5(b)]  above
    rendered  either  party  in  breach  of  the  Consent  Order.    While,
    ultimately, the Secretary of State's new decision was  made  some  four
    months later, considerably later than  agreed,  this  default  did  not
    entail any breach of the Consent Order.

32. What, then, are the options available to a  litigant  in  circumstances
    where a void of this kind materialises?  They  are  basically  twofold.
    The first is the essentially prosaic one of pressing the  Secretary  of
    State's representatives (as the  Applicant's  solicitors  properly  did
    here) and seeking to agree a new  timetable.   In  these  circumstances
    there will  be  a  powerful  duty  of  both  explanation  and  enhanced
    expedition on the  Secretary  of  State.   The  second  option  is  the
    initiation of fresh judicial review proceedings.  I have reproduced  in
    [23] above the relevant passages in the Lord Chief Justice's Direction.
     The correct analysis  of  the  kind  of  void  which  arose  in  these
    proceedings is,  in  my  view,  an  "omission  or  failure  to  make  a
    decision... under the Immigration Acts" on the part of the Secretary of
    State.  This analysis flows from a relatively straightforward  exercise
    of construction.  It follows that the correct forum for the  initiation
    of any such further judicial review proceedings would be the UT.

33. Thus I concur with the order of Upper Tribunal Judge Rimington noted in
    [9] above.

34. If, in the circumstances  under  scrutiny,  a  litigant  is  driven  to
    issuing fresh proceedings this would of course be  highly  regrettable.
    Fundamentally  it  would  be  inimical  to  the  overriding  objective.
    However,  it  is  necessary  to  acknowledge  the  twin  phenomena   of
    unforeseen developments and human ineptitude.  Where a second  judicial
    review application is initiated in this way it  will  be  open  to  the
    disappointed litigant to request expedition.  As practitioners will  be
    aware, in the UT requests of this kind are allocated  to  a  Judge  for
    expedited assessment normally within 48 hours.  The UT exercises a wide
    discretion in relation to  expedition.   The  Judge  will  consider  in
    particular - and inexhaustively - the whole of the  background  period,
    the depth and extent of the default on the part  of  the  Secretary  of
    State, any default or contributory fault on the part of  the  litigant,
    the personal, family and economic circumstances of the litigant and the
    position of any affected children.  The options of interim  relief  and
    "rolled up" hearings will be live.  Furthermore, in cases of  egregious
    and unjustified delay  issues  of  indemnity  costs  could  conceivably
    arise.

35. Mr O'Callaghan's submissions also draw attention to a  procedural  rule
    of the High  Court,  namely  CPR  3.1(7).   This  is  one  of  multiple
    provisions in a regime  arranged  under  the  rubric  of  "The  Court's
    General Powers of Case Management".  These include powers to extend  or
    abridge  time,  to  consolidate  cases  and  to  receive  evidence   by
    telephone.  Rule 3.1(7) provides:

       "A power of the Court under these Rules to make an order  includes  a
           power to vary or revoke the order."

If one interprets this provision  literally  -  and  there  is  no  apparent
    reason for any different  interpretative  approach  -  the  formula  of
    "liberty to apply", prevalent in the judicial review sphere of the UT's
    jurisdiction, may not strictly be necessary  in  a  High  Court  order.
    What is important for present purposes is that the UT's  Rules  contain
    no provision equivalent to Rule 3.1(7).  While acknowledging that  this
    discrete issue may  require  more  detailed  argument  on  some  future
    occasion, I rather doubt whether a power  of  this  nature,  given  its
    intrusive effect and  its  departure  from  the  ut  sit  finis  litium
    principle, could be implied via the UT's general power to regulate  its
    own procedure or to give directions "in  relation  to  the  conduct  or
    disposal of proceedings": per Rule 5(1) and (2). Furthermore, one might
    question whether CPR 3.1(7) can properly be characterised a (mere) case
    management power.

36. Some brief comments on the "default matrix" of the present case may  be
    helpful. Neither party can lay claim to the moral high ground  in  this
    respect.  On  the  Applicant's  side,  the   whole   of   the   further
    representations and evidence  were  provided  within  some  ten  weeks,
    rather than  the  agreed  three  weeks.   This  had  the  effect  of  a
    significantly later commencement of the three month period available to
    the Secretary of State.  However, on the evidence,  the  ensuing  three
    months were characterised by protracted official  inertia  -  with  the
    single exception noted in  [6]  above  -  followed  by  an  essentially
    unexplained hiatus of a further three months.

37. It is likely that the initiation of fresh judicial  review  proceedings
    at any stage after mid-October 2016 would have  elicited  a  favourable
    response from the UT, particularly as regards expedition.   As  regards
    further judicial intervention,  it  is  likely  on  the  evidence  that
    expedited mandatory relief and costs would have been ordered given  the
    absence of any explanation of why a further  asylum  interview  (itself
    unexceptional and prima facie justified) could not be  held  until  six
    months after the beginning of  the  Secretary  of  State's  voluntarily
    assumed three month period for a fresh decision. While the focus of the
    UT would have been mainly on  the  post-Consent  Order  phase,  account
    would also have been taken  of  the  antecedent  period,  which  is  of
    considerable longevity.  Furthermore, at a general level,  there  would
    have been real concern about the adverse consequences of delay  in  the
    sphere of asylum and immigration decision making.

38. The Consent Order reproduced in [4] above is couched in terms  familiar
    to practitioners and Judges alike.  The parties'  cooperative  response
    to pre-hearing directions has confirmed my experience, shared by  other
    judicial members of the Chamber, that there is a lack of uniformity  in
    the models deployed.  This exercise establishes that while the  Consent
    Order in this case is frequently deployed,  Judges  are  also  familiar
    with the other versions contained in Appendices 1 - 3 to this judgment.



39. The Consent Order in this case invites the observation,  made  in  [29]
    above, that it contains no "special circumstances" or "best endeavours"
    qualification. There will be cases where  it  is  appropriate  for  the
    parties to agree an  order  in  these  terms  and  to  secure  judicial
    approval thereof.  However, there will surely be other cases in which a
    qualification of the kind highlighted should sensibly and  properly  be
    incorporated.   Furthermore,  there  may  be  cases  in  which  it   is
    appropriate for the  Secretary  of  State  to  be  ordered  to  take  a
    specified course  of  action  within  a  stipulated  time  limit.   The
    parties' representatives (in the first place) and  the  Tribunal,  when
    considering a proposed consent order in draft, should be alert to these
    variations.

40. Coincidentally, in this context, I have just given judgment in  another
    case in which I stated the following:

           "[27] In the exercise of my discretion,  having  regard  to  the
                 egregious  nature   of   the   public   law   misdemeanours
                 established,  the  extensive  delay  on  the  part  of  the
                 Secretary  of  State,  the  factor  of  protracted   family
                 fragmentation, the involvement of  four  directly  affected
                 children  of  tender  years  and  the  lamentable   history
                 generally,  I would have granted the following remedies:


                   a) an order quashing  the  refusals  on  behalf  of  the
                      Secretary of State  to  examine  each  of  the  three
                      outstanding  family  reunification  applications   on
                      their facts and merits; and


                   b) a mandatory order requiring the Secretary of State to
                      determine  these  applications  on  their  facts  and
                      merits within 21 days maximum.


           [28]  However, at the eleventh hour, the Tribunal was requested
                 by the parties to approve a draft Consent Order, the
                 material portions whereof are the following:


                       "UPON  THE  RESPONDENT   agreeing   to   accept   for
                       consideration the  Applicant's  wife  and  children's
                       family  reunion  applications,  to  be  submitted  in
                       person at the Visa Application Centre in Basra, Iraq;


                       AND UPON THE RESPONDENT  agreeing  to  use  her  best
                       endeavours to issue a decision as soon  as  possible,
                       and  no  later  than  the  current   published   visa
                       processing guidelines, absent special circumstances;

                      BY CONSENT, it is ordered that:-

                      1 .    The  hearing  listed  for  26  April  2016  be
                      vacated;


                         2. The Applicant do  have  leave  to  withdraw  the
                            above-numbered claim for judicial review.""




           (R (on the application of Al-Anizy)  v  Secretary of  State  for
           the Home Department (undocumented Bidoons - Home Office  policy)
           [2017] UKUT 00197 (IAC), at [27] - [28].)




      The draft consent order in Al-Anizy was not, of course, binding on the
      Tribunal.  There are two fundamental  reasons  for  this.   First,  in
      judicial review proceedings, it is not open to the parties to  dictate
      the outcome.  Rather, the twofold question of whether a remedy  should
      be granted and, if so, in what terms, lies within  the  discretion  of
      the court or tribunal.  Second, the withdrawal of any case before  the
      UT and the authorisation of every consent order requires the  approval
      of the Tribunal, per Rules 17 and 39(1) of the 2008 Rules (supra).



41. In cases where the Secretary of State is willing to execute  a  consent
    order  without  qualification  there  will  be  no   recitals/operative
    provisions dichotomy and, in principle, contempt proceedings could lie.
     An order of this particular  genre  will  place  the  Applicant  in  a
    particularly  strong  position  and  the  Secretary  of  State   in   a
    correspondingly vulnerable one in the event of contempt proceedings  or
    a fresh judicial review claim.

42. The consent order is a mechanism of fundamental importance and  utility
    in public law litigation.  I endorse it unreservedly.  The dichotomy of
    recitals (on the one hand) and  operative  provisions  (on  the  other)
    promotes many of  the  ingredients  of  the  overriding  objective  and
    should, therefore, continue. All such orders must, however, be  couched
    in  terms  which  respect  and  promote   the   essential   values   of
    transparency, clarity and certainty.

43. I take the opportunity of emphasising that the UT, in common with every
    court  and  tribunal,  will  not  tolerate  breaches  of  its   orders.
    Miscreants and defaulters, whether citizen  or  public  authority,  are
    treated with absolute equality.  As the standard orders and  directions
    of this Chamber and several recent reported  decisions  emphasise,  the
    sanctions available are not confined to contempt action.   They  extend
    also to adverse costs orders and referrals to  professional  regulatory
    bodies. See in particular Shabir Ahmed (Sanctions  for  Non-Compliance)
    [2016] UKUT 562 (IAC).

44. As I have repeatedly emphasised, in various contexts, the UT  does  not
    wish to  be  embroiled  in  enforcement  measures.   Furthermore,  this
    discrete field of  activity  involves  a  highly  regrettable,  frankly
    deplorable, waste of  scarce  judicial  and  administrative  resources.
    Happily the constructive and productive interaction which characterises
    the UTIAC Judges and Practitioners Forum make abundantly clear that all
    share the same goal.

Order

45. The Applicant's application for enforcement/reinstatement/variation  in
    the terms set forth in [9] above is refused for the reasons given.

Costs

     46. (i)      The provisions for costs in the  Tribunal's  Order  of  14
         April 2016 remain operative.

    (ii)   All further costs incurred subsequently  shall  lie  where  they
         fall, via no order as to costs inter-partes.

Permission to appeal

     47. Neither party seeks permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.
