Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Appiah, Counsel (Direct Access)
For the Respondent:    Mr Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a Chinese national who originally came to  the  United
    Kingdom on May 23, 2000 with leave to enter and remain  until  May  23,
    2001.  On October 30, 2014 he was granted leave to  remain  outside  of
    the Immigration Rules until April 30, 2017 based on his relationship to
    his son.

 2. On March 16, 2017 the appellant applied for further leave to remain  on
    the basis of continuing family life with his son,  but  the  respondent
    refused this application on April 24,  2018.   The  appellant  appealed
    this decision under Section 82(1) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002.

 3. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Nightingale dealt with his  appeal  on
    the papers and in a decision promulgated on April 24,  2019  the  Judge
    found that the appellant did not satisfy the Immigration Rules (Section
    E-LTRPT.2.4. and Section EX.1. of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules)
    and further found that at the date of hearing there was no family  life
    existing between the appellant and  his  child  and  it  would  not  be
    disproportionate to remove him.

 4. The appellant appealed this decision  and  was  granted  permission  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Andrew on  June  12,  2019  who  found
    there was an arguable error in law on the basis the FtT Judge  had  not
    considered Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and  Immigration  Act
    2009.  In granting permission, Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Andrew
    stated that the FtT Judge had made sustainable findings in relation  to
    contact between the appellant and his son.

    PRELIMINARY ISSUES

 5. I raised with Ms  Appiah  whether  Section  55  of  the  2009  Act  was
    something which this Tribunal needed to concern itself with,  in  light
    of the findings and comments made  by  both  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Andrew and the FtT Judge with  regard  to  family  life.   The
    point being that if there was no family life in existence then  Section
    55 would not be a consideration that would have troubled the FtT Judge.

 6. Ms Appiah conceded that Section 55 would only  need  to  be  considered
    where Article 8 applied  and  in  light  of  the  restricted  grant  of
    permission she accepted that based on  the  FtT  Judge's  finding,  the
    reality was Section 55  was  not  a  matter  that  would  trouble  this
    Tribunal in this case.

    FINDING

 7. Having considered the papers  and  most  importantly  the  FtT  Judge's
    decision, I have concluded there is no error in law.

 8. The FtT Judge considered the  issue  of  family  life  and  whilst  the
    decision was not the  most  detailed,  he  nevertheless  gave  adequate
    reasons for finding no family life.

 9. Grounds  of  appeal  had  been  submitted  against  the  decision,  but
    ultimately Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Andrew had found  that  the
    findings on contact and ultimately Article 8 were open to the FtT Judge
    and it cannot  therefore  be  an  argument  that  Section  55  was  not
    considered.

10. In the circumstances there was no error of law and I therefore  dismiss
    this appeal.

    DECISION

11. There was no error of law.  I uphold the decision.

12. No anonymity direction is made.


Signed                              Date         2 August 2019
