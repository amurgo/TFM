Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M. Al-Rashid, of counsel.
For the Respondent:    Mr L. Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                                  DECISION

   1. The appellant, who is a citizen of Nigeria, was  first  granted  entry
      clearance as a visitor to the United Kingdom in 1981.  Since  then  he
      has made a significant number of visits, either with  entry  clearance
      in that capacity for a specific applied for or on the basis of a multi
      entrance visit visa issued to him. On 27 April 1996, he  was  admitted
      as a visitor and not long after that, on 2 June 1996, he  departed  to
      travel to Belgium. He returned to the United Kingdom on  4  June  1996
      and sought to be admitted again as a visitor on the basis of the multi-
      visit visa issued to him. However, on arrival in the United Kingdom he
      was refused leave to enter because it had  come  to  the  respondent's
      knowledge that the appellant had been in breach of the  conditions  of
      his visit visa as he had been conducting  a  business  in  the  United
      Kingdom. He was returned to Belgium the same day.


   2. Despite this, about two weeks later, on 21 June  1996,  the  appellant
      returned to the United Kingdom, making an unlawful entry, and  he  has
      remained unlawfully ever since.


   3. On 24 June 2015 the appellant made an application for leave to  remain
      on the basis that he had lived continuously in the United Kingdom  for
      at  least  20  years  so  that  he  met  the  requirements   of   para
      276ADE(1)(iii) of the immigration rules.


   4. In a decision expressed as a refusal to carry out a reconsideration of
      an earlier decision, the respondent rejected this application,  saying
      that the appellant had in fact been living continuously in the  United
      Kingdom not for the 20 years claimed but for  19  years,  that  period
      being calculated from  his unlawful entry on 21 June 1996.


   5. Although it had previously been the appellant's case that  the  period
      of continuous residence should have  been  calculated  from  27  April
      1996, when he was admitted as a visitor with  a  valid  visa,  Mr  Al-
      Rashid now accepts, correctly, that is not arguable  in  view  of  the
      fact that the appellant was refused entry on 4 June 1996 and  returned
      to Belgium (see para 276A(a) of the immigration rules). Therefore,  Mr
      Al-Rashid  accepts  that  the  appellant  could  not   succeed   under
      276ADE(1)(iii) and so does not pursue the challenge to the finding  of
      the judge to the contrary.


   6. The challenge that is pursued by Mr Al-Rashid  is  this:  Contrary  to
      what the judge said at paragraph  12  of  the  determination,  a  s120
      notice was served on the appellant with the  decision  to  refuse  his
      application and he made a response on 21 June 2016. There was, as  the
      judge recognised, a claim before the First-tier  Tribunal  that  there
      would be an impermissible infringement of rights protected by  article
      8 ECHR if leave were not granted. Although it  is  not  suggested  now
      that the appellant could succeed under the immigration  rules,  it  is
      submitted that the judge should have allowed the  appeal  outside  the
      rules on article 8 grounds.


   7. The main thrust of that submission is that, since  the  appellant  had
      returned to the United Kingdom, even if by making an  unlawful  entry,
      on 21 June 1996, therefore by the date of the hearing, on 16  November
      2016, the appellant had been living in the  United  Kingdom  for  more
      than 20 years. Although that  did  not  mean  that  he  satisfied  the
      requirements of 276ADE(1)(iii), because that required such a period to
      have been demonstrated  to  have  been  accrued  by  the  date  of  an
      application for leave, it was, in Mr Al-Rashid's submission, a  cogent
      indication  that  the  appellant  had  been  present  long  enough  to
      establish a private life that merited the protection of article 8.


   8.  The  evidence  before  the  judge  as  to  the   appellant's   living
      arrangements was  unsatisfactory.  The  judge  recorded  the  evidence
      given:
           "The appellant had purchased a property, which  he  rented  out.
           He said he funded the mortgage payments from the rent.  He  said
           he had no recourse to state benefits in the UK. He said that  he
           was living with his cousin AO (other than for a couple of  years
           from 1998-2000 when he had rented a flat). AO let him live  rent
           free and paid all the appellant's bills. The appellant  said  he
           did not have to contribute to the household expenses.
           AO's evidence was different. His letter said that the  appellant
           had lived with him since May 1995, other  than  from  2005-2010.
           However, in his oral evidence he said that the appellant now had
           his own flat but that he did not have the address, though he had
           visited there.... AO also said that he helped the  appellant  by
           giving him ï¿½60-70 occasionally but that he did not pay his  rent
           or his bills on a regular basis..."


   9. Having  found  that  the  appellant  had  not  established  20  years'
      continuous residence the judge concluded:


           "I heard no evidence of any very significant  obstacles  to  the
           appellant's return to Nigeria. He had made enough money from his
           various business dealings to be able to purchase a  property  in
           the UK and if he were to sell his property (which is in  London)
           he  would  have  sufficient  funds  to  re-start  his  life   in
           Nigeria.... He was educated  and  worked  in  Nigeria  for  many
           years. He does not satisfy 276ADE (1)(vi)."
      Although the judge then said that she had heard nothing to lead  to  a
      conclusion  that  there  were  compelling  circumstances  such  as  to
      consider article 8 outside the immigration rules, she went on  to  say
      that, if she were wrong about that, having directed herself  in  terms
      of "the Razgar principles", and s117B of the Nationality,  Immigration
      and Asylum Act 2002, she saw nothing  to  justify  a  grant  of  leave
      outside the rules. That was because the appellant's private  life  had
      been built during a period when  he  was  unlawfully  present  in  the
      United Kingdom so that  little  weight  could  be  given  to  that  in
      striking a balance between the competing interest in play.  The  judge
      rejected Mr Al-Rashid's submission that s117B was not intended to have
      "retrospective effect" so that it applied only to  that  part  of  the
      appellant's  private  life  established  after  2014  when  s117B  was
      introduced into the 2002 Act. In my judgement, she was  plainly  right
      to reject that submission.
  10. I invited Mr Al-Rashid to  identify  the  issues  that  spoke  in  the
      appellant's favour  in  the  article  8  proportionality  balance.  He
      pointed to the fact that the appellant had now established  20  years'
      continuous residence and emphasised that  was  relevant  not  just  in
      terms of the likely integration  into  the  United  Kingdom  but  also
      probable loss of ties with Nigeria. The  judge  had  herself  recorded
      that he had no recourse to public funds.


  11. I am entirely satisfied that in dismissing the  appeal  on  the  basis
      that the appellant's article 8 claim could not succeed  either  within
      or outside the rules, the judge made no  error  of  law,  material  or
      otherwise. This was an appellant who had breached conditions of  leave
      when admitted as a visitor and who had to be returned to  the  country
      from which he embarked,  only  to  return  unlawfully  to  the  United
      Kingdom shortly afterwards. He then made no attempt to regularise  his
      stay, instead waiting until he thought, incorrectly as it turned  out,
      that he had accumulated a sufficient period of unlawful  residence  to
      ensure success in his application under the immigration rules.  As  he
      has been unlawfully present in the United Kingdom while  building  the
      private life upon which he now relies, little weight can be  given  to
      that as a consequence of s117B(4). Of particular significance  in  the
      circumstances of  this  case  is  s117B(1)  which  provides  that  the
      maintenance  of  effective  immigration  controls  is  in  the  public
      interest. By failing to comply with conditions  of  entry,  making  an
      unlawful entry shortly after being returned to Belgium  and  remaining
      unlawfully thereafter the appellant has done  much  to  frustrate  the
      maintenance of effective immigration  control.  He  has  been  in  the
      United Kingdom for a long period of time but  it  is  plain  from  the
      evidence before the judge that he has maintained some links, not least
      because he has a wife and 3 adult  children  in  Nigeria  to  whom  he
      sometimes sends money, although he speaks of being estranged from  his
      wife. For these reasons, it is hard to see what outcome was rationally
      open to the judge other than to reach the  conclusions  she  did  that
      this was an appeal that fell to be dismissed. The reasons that she did
      provide for reaching her decision were clear and legally sufficient.
      Summary of decision:
  12. The judge did not make any error of law and her  decision  to  dismiss
      the appeal is to stand.


  13. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
