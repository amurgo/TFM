               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Sharma, Counsel instructed by S Satha & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Somalia and  his  date  of  birth  is  10
    March 1990. He came to the UK on  13  September  2001  with  his  step-
    grandmother to join his step mother and he was granted ILR as a refugee
    on 22 April 2015.   The  respondent  made  a  decision  to  deport  the
    appellant pursuant to Section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act  2007  and  a
    decision under Section 72 of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002, a decision under paragraph 339D of the Rules to cease refugee
    protection and to exclude the appellant  from  humanitarian  protection
    under paragraph 339C of the Rules.  These decisions  came  about  as  a
    result of the appellant's criminal conduct.

2.   The appellant appealed against the decision of the Secretary  of  State
    and his appeal was  dismissed  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Robinson in a decision that was promulgated on 19 February  2016.   The
    appellant appealed against the decision under Article 3 and 8 only. The
    decision to dismiss the appeal under Articles 3 and 8  (under  339A  of
    the Immigration Rules) was  set  aside  by  a  panel  comprising  Upper
    Tribunal Judge McWilliam and Upper Tribunal Judge Goldstein on  8  June
    2016 at an error of law hearing at Field House on  23  May  2016.   The
    panel found that the judge materially for the following reasons;

         "7.  Mr Duffy conceded that in relation to  the  Immigration  Rules
             the judge failed to make a finding in  relation  to  paragraph
             399A(b) ('he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK')
             and we agree with Mr Duffy on this point.  Mr  Duffy  conceded
             that  the  judge  inadequately  reasoned  the  decision  under
             paragraph 399A(c) ('there would be very significant  obstacles
             to his integration into the country to which it is proposed he
             is deported') (with reference to [71] (see above)) and we also
             agreed with Mr Duffy on this point.  In our view,  it  is  not
             clear from the decision  of  the  judge  why  he  reached  the
             conclusion that the Appellant would be  able  to  access  some
             support from the minority Brava clan.  The judge did not  make
             a clear and unequivocal finding in relation to whether or  not
             the Appellant has family members in Somalia.   The  judge  did
             not make a clear finding about whether or not he accepted that
             the OASys report was an accurate record of what the  Appellant
             said to the author and if so whether what was said  accurately
             represented the position.  The findings at  [71]  relating  to
             support from relatives in the UK is inadequately reasoned.  It
             is not clear from the decision what support the Appellant  has
             received from relatives in the UK and how,  if  at  all,  this
             support could extend to financial support to the Appellant  in
             Somalia.

         8.   Mr Duffy did  not  accept  that  the  error  was  material  in
             relation to the conclusion under Article 3.  We do not  agree.
             The finding under Article 3  is  infected  by  the  identified
             errors.  We have taken into consideration the guidance in  MOJ
             and Ors (Return to Mogadishu) Somalia CG [2014] UKUT 00442 and
             conclude and that the findings of the judge in relation to the
             availability of remittances from the UK  and  family  or  clan
             associations in Somalia fed into the decision of the judge  to
             dismiss the appeal under Article 3.  It follows that the judge
             made an error of law such that  the  decision  should  be  set
             aside and we communicated this to the parties at the hearing."

3.   The matter came before me on 14 September 2016 for a  resumed  hearing.
    On this occasion shortly after the appellant commenced  examination-in-
    chief he displayed physical signs that he was unwell and the matter was
    adjourned.  His barrister, Mr Sharma was concerned that he was not able
    to give reliable evidence and he made an application for an adjournment
    in order to obtain medical evidence.  I adjourned and made a number  of
    directions to which the appellant's  solicitors  have  responded.   The
    appellant has not submitted any further up-to-date medical evidence.

4.   The trigger offences are two counts of  sexual  assault  on  a  female.
    The appellant was convicted on 16 August  2013.  He  was  sentenced  to
    twelve months'  imprisonment  on  one  count  and  placed  on  the  sex
    offenders' register for ten years.  In relation to the second count  he
    was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment to run consecutively.   At
    the start of the hearing before me  on  19  October  2016  the  parties
    confirmed that the appellant's criminal  history  as  set  out  in  the
    Reasons for Refusal Letter at paragraphs 11 to 21 is accurate:

         "11. On 27 March 2009, you were convicted at Stratford  Magistrates

             being revoked.

         17.  On 12 October 2010, you  were  convicted  at  City  of  London

             failing to surrender to custody  at  an  appointed  time,  for
             which no separate penalty was given."

5.   Both parties submitted detailed skeleton arguments and relied  on  case
    law including SSHD v Said [2016] EWCA Civ 442 and the country  guidance
    case of MOJ v SSHD [2014] UKUT 00442.

6.   The appellant and his step-grandmother gave evidence  before  me.  They
    relied on their witness statements dated 23 September 2015  which  were
    before the FtT.  They gave evidence before Judge Robinson. There was no
    reason to depart from the unchallenged  evidence  as  recorded  in  the
    decision of Judge Robinson.

The Appellant's Evidence

 7.  On arrival to the UK in September 2001, with his  step-grandmother,  he
    went to stay with his step-mother (Faiza) and her other children.  They
    were already in the UK.  He  attended  school  here  and  he  struggled
    because of his background and a lack  of  formal  education.   He  left
    college in 2009 and he did voluntary work at a youth centre.

8.   The appellant lived in the family home until 2010 when he went to  stay
    with friends. In February 2011 he was provided with his  own  flat.  He
    fell  into  bad  company  and  started  drinking  and  taking   illegal
    substances. He got into trouble with the police.  At some point he felt
    his mental health was deteriorating and he became  depressed,  confused
    and forgetful.

9.   The appellant believes his life  is  in  danger  should  he  return  to
    Somalia and that he will face threatening difficulties having left  the
    country when he was a boy.  He does not have any  practical  connection
    with Somalia.  He does not have family members living there and  he  is
    vulnerable and unprotected.  His mother died when he was young.  He  is
    not fluent in the language and he  does  not  have  much  knowledge  of
    Somali customs and traditions.  He would not have a home there  and  he
    would be at risk of abduction and unlawful killing by armed  gangs  and
    or militants.  He would face homelessness and destitution  in  Somalia.
    He would be a foreigner there with no form of support.  In  the  UK  he
    has his step-grandmother, sister and several cousins with whom  he  has
    close bonds. His step-grandmother is not in good health.

10.  The appellant cannot remember his now deceased  biological  mother.  He
    denies telling a probation officer that his mother was still living  in
    Somalia (as reported in the OASYs report). He obtained an  IT  level  2
    diploma which he confirmed to me in oral evidence.  He has never worked
    in the UK.  He accepted that that he had  told  the  probation  officer
    (see the OASys Report) that he had worked as a cleaner. It is not true,
    but he said it because he thought that it would help him at  the  time.
    He is  not  conscious  of  his  clan  background  and  that  his  step-
    grandmother had told him that all the members of the clan known to  his
    family were dead.  In oral evidence before me he said that he  did  not
    know his clan.

11.  The appellant was asked why his family in the UK could not support  him
    in Somalia and he stated that  they  had  told  him  this.  They  would
    support him if he was released from prison his relatives in Woking have
    agreed to help him find somewhere to live and to find a job.   He  said
    that his family could not help him  financially  should  he  return  to
    Somalia because they do not know where to send  money  to.   He  stated
    that he did not have a mobile phone and would not be  able  to  contact
    them and he would not have the money to buy a mobile phone.

12.  The appellant confirmed to me that he fears return to  Somalia  because
    of Al-Shabaab and violence. He stated that he will be forced  to  join.
    He stated that he does not want to go back because it is dangerous  and
    there is a lack of education. He would not be able to find a job and he
    has no family there.

The Evidence of Ms A

13.  Ms A's evidence is contained in her witness  statement.   Her  evidence
    is that the appellant's biological mother died a few  months  after  he
    was born in Somalia and his father married her daughter.  Ms A  arrived
    in the UK in 2001 with the appellant and his sister.  The appellant was
    always different from  the  other  children.  He  seemed  to  have  low
    intelligence and did not behave according to his age.  He  dropped  out
    of college and started to get into trouble with the  police.   He  told
    her that he was worried about mental health  problems  and  she  became
    concerned about him.  Ms A has high blood pressure  and  other  medical
    problems.  She is very  concerned  about  the  appellant  returning  to
    Somalia because of his mental state.  She does not believe that he will
    survive there.  In oral evidence before me she said that the  appellant
    would not be fit enough to return and that people like  him  are  taken
    advantage of.

14.    Ms A is a pensioner and she could not afford to  send  money  to  the
    appellant.  She lives on a state pension and is assisted financially by
    her children who sometimes help with bills. However, usually neighbours
    and people from the mosque help her.  She has five children. Three  are
    in work, but their incomes are low.  Two of her sons  live  in  Woking.
    One works in a detention centre and the other  is  employed  by  London
    Underground. They have families.  The appellant does not know  anything
    about his clan membership and he would not get any support in  Somalia.
    He would be recruited by Al Shabaab because they are always looking out
    for people like him who do not have family or money  and  he  would  be
    given weapons and explosives.  The appellant does not have  any  family
    in Somalia.  When the appellant moved out of the family home  here  she
    was worried and she went after him and he came back for a short  period
    of time.  He last lived with her about six years ago.   After  that  he
    visited her, but he never said that he had a job.

15.  Ms A confirmed that the family would help  the  appellant  relocate  to
    Woking and she also intends for him to  receive  treatment  for  mental
    health problems.  She confirmed that the family would try  and  support
    the appellant as much as they could but they would like government help
    as well.  She visits him in prison on average twice a month but he does
    not always agree to see her.

The OASys Report

16.  There is an OASys Report following an assessment on 9  June  2014.   It
    is stated in the report that  the  appellant  does  not  recognise  the
    impact and consequences of offending on the  victim  and  he  does  not
    accept responsibility for the offence (having pleaded not guilty)   and
    he was unable to say why he committed the offence (see para  2.6).   It
    was difficult to determine if this is as a result of his ongoing mental
    health issues or refusal to take responsibility for  his  actions  (see
    para 2.11).  The report concluded that it there is an emerging  pattern
    of similar offending (see para 2.12). Paragraph 2.14 reads as follows:

         "It  is  concerning  that  [  the  appellant]  has   acquired   two
         convictions for sexual offences in a  relatively  short  period  of
         time and on both occasions it appears he has taken  little  if  any
         responsibility for his offending.  This is evident in the fact that
         he  has  repeatedly  failed  to  comply  with  the  sex   offenders
         'notification requirement."

17.   The  report  concludes  that  the  appellant    has   minor   learning
    difficulties and that he informed the author of the report  that  prior
    to being on remand he was working part-time as a  cleaner  (  see  para
    4.10) and that information  contained  in  a  previous  probation  file
    indicated that he did not achieve  qualifications  at  school  and  had
    difficulty learning.  Paragraph 6.9 of the report states as follows

         "[The appellant] was a young man of Somalia descent and the  eldest
         of two children.  He informs me that his mother  lives  in  Somalia
         and that he has the support of his cousins in the UK.   He  further
         informs me that he has resided in the  UK  for  the  past  fourteen
         years and previous  records  indicate  a  difficult  upbringing  in
         Somalia  where  he  witnessed  war  and  people  being  killed  and
         tortured.  His memory of earlier years are  filled  with  pain  and
         suffering which has caused him  fear  and  anxiety  and  may  be  a
         catalyst of his mental health issues at this time.  He  informs  me
         that he currently not (sic) and  has  never  been  in  an  intimate
         relationship and has no children.  It is of concern that this is  a
         young man who appears to have  never  experiences  (sic)  a  normal
         intimate relationship with a partner  and  has  now  committed  two
         sexual offences against females within a short period of time."

18.  At para 10.8 it is  stated  that  the  appellant  reported  no  current
    mental health issues; however, there was a document from a psychologist
    at Newham to confirm he has minor learning difficulties.  The appellant
    informed the author of the report that he had no  previous  or  current
    mental  health  issues,  however  his  solicitor  has  commissioned   a
    psychiatric evaluation to determine if there  are  any  medical  health
    needs and that the author had been advised that the  psychiatrist  will
    not be recommending a mental health disposal at  this  time.   At  para
    11.10 it is stated that the appellant failed to engage in  appointments
    and has committed a further offence namely failing to comply  with  the
    sex offenders' register and that he does not appear to be motivated  in
    addressing his offending behaviour.  It  goes  on  to  state  that  the
    nature of the appellant's offending indicates a lack  of  consequential
    thinking and problem-solving skills which is further aggravated by  the
    fact that he appears unable to learn from his mistakes.

19.  In terms of risk of harm to the public and  risk  of  re-offending  the
    predictor scores percentage and risk category indicate that  the  score
    for probability of proven re-offending and probability of  proven  non-
    violent re-offending is high whilst the probability of  proven  violent
    type re-offending is medium. The likelihood of serious harm  to  others
    is assessed as medium and it is concluded that the offender is  not  at
    all motivated to address his offending.

Medical Notes

20.  The notes relate to the period from 16 July  2014  until  August  2015.
    There a history of self-harm. The notes make reference to an attempt in
    2013, but indicate that the appellant is not at risk of self-harm.   In
    the notes there is an entry on 9  December  2014  indicating  that  the
    appellant was keen to be relocated to a mental health unit and  on  the
    same day there is an entry that  there  is  no  evidence  of  psychotic
    phenomenon noted, reported or previously observed.  The appellant  told
    the mental health nurse that he had received  treatment  at  a  clinic.
    On 22 June 2015 there was a  mental  health  referral  form  where  the
    referrer, a prison officer,  had  no  concerns  about  the  appellant's
    mental health.  There is an entry on 17 July 2015  that  the  appellant
    presented himself as a  person  with  mild  learning  difficulties  and
    difficulty  remembering  and  paying   attention.    He   requested   a
    prescription of antidepressants and to be referred to  a  psychiatrist.
    The entry on 21 July 2015 is that the appellant had  not  stayed  in  a
    psychiatric hospital, he does not feel like  self-harming  or  suicide,
    but that he appeared disengaged with answering questions.   He  has  no
    outstanding hospital or doctors appointments and he has  not  tried  to
    harm himself whilst in prison.





Submissions

21.  I heard full submissions from Mr Jarvis and Mr Sharma who  both  relied
    on their skeleton arguments.  Mr Jarvis made submission in the  context
    of his skeleton argument. He submitted  that  the  Tribunal  could  not
    accept the core of  the  appellant's  evidence  and  that  he  had  not
    discharged the burden of proof. He submitted that his evidence and  the
    evidence of his step-grandmother was not credible in the light  of  the
    evidence as a whole.

22.  Mr Sharma made submissions in the context of his skeleton argument  and
    he further submitted that even if the appellant  is  a  member  of  the
    Bravanese clan he is not the sort of person who can turn  to  his  clan
    for assistance because he does not associate himself with his clan.  He
    urged me to accept the step-grandmother's evidence and he would ask  me
    to consider what the  appellant  said  to  the  probation  officer  who
    prepared the OASYs report in the light of the mental health issues.

23.  Mr Sharma submitted that there are only three  family  members  working
    here. It is easier to support someone living in your home than it is to
    provide support to them if they move abroad.  There was no evidence  to
    rebut the appellant's evidence in relation to his family support.   The
    appellant has received significant moral support from his  family.   He
    would not be able to take advantage of the  economic  boom  in  Somalia
    because of his low intelligence and focus. He is easily distracted  and
    disengaged and Mr Sharma referred me to extracts of the  medical  notes
    in support of his assertions.  He also stated that I  should  not  give
    weight to the appellant's evidence where it is inconsistent  with  that
    of his grandmother's.  He argued that the  appellant  is  a  vulnerable
    person and return to Mogadishu should be considered  in  that  context.
    He would not be able to access treatment in  Mogadishu.   He  confirmed
    that this was not a trafficking case but argued that the appellant  was
    highly vulnerable and could be taken advantage of.

24.  In response to my questions, Mr Sharma  stated  that  this  was  not  a
    destitution case.  He submitted that the appellant  is  vulnerable,  he
    would not have family or clan support and he would be an IDP. He is  at
    high risk because of his vulnerability.  He would  be  taken  advantage
    of. Mr Sharma stated that he will not put  the  case  any  higher  than
    that.

Conclusions

25.   I  find  the  appellant  wholly  lacking  in  credibility.  There  are
    significant problems with his evidence and I reject  the  core  of  his
    account.  I found that he was highly motivated by  a  desire  to  avoid
    deportation and likewise Ms  A  was  clearly  and  understandably  very
    anxious and concerned for the appellant was similarly motivated. I have
    considered her evidence in the light of the  appellant's  evidence  and
    what he said to the probation officer. Ms  A's  evidence  in  isolation
    would not cause me concern; however, I must consider  her  evidence  in
    the context of the evidence as a whole and as such  I  find  it  to  be
    unreliable.

26.  I find that the appellant has failed to establish that  his  family  in
    the UK would not be willing and able to support him financially  should
    he return there.  I appreciate Mr Sharma's point that it is  easier  to
    support people if they are living within their home but  the  appellant
    has failed to discharge the burden of proof that is on him to establish
    that family members here would not be able to support him.   There  are
    at least three family members who are in paid employment none  of  whom
    attended the hearing or gave witness statements.  Ms A's  evidence  was
    vague as to their respective financial  positions.   The  appellant  in
    oral evidence did not say that his family would be unwilling or  unable
    to send him money but they would not know where to send it to.

27.  Mr Sharma asked me not to give the appellant's  evidence  weight  where
    it is inconsistent with the evidence of his grandmother and in  support
    of this he referred me to specific entries in the NHS  notes  submitted
    in support of  the  argument  that  the  appellant  has  mental  health
    problems and that he is  a  vulnerable  person.   I  reject  this.  The
    medical evidence does not establish that the appellant has at the  date
    of the hearing a mental health problem that  would  have  any  material
    impact on his ability to give evidence or indeed my decision. There  is
    no expert evidence relied on.  The entries that I was  referred  to  in
    the NHS medical notes which are not up to  date,  establish,  at  best,
    that the appellant made a suicide attempt in 2013 and has,  at  various
    times, been depressed. There is no evidence before me relating  to  the
    attempt to take  his  life  in  2013.   I  find  that  the  appellant's
    depression is linked to the possibility of  deportation.  He  has  been
    prescribed medication for depression.  I accept that the appellant  has
    mild learning difficulties, but there is no cogent evidence  before  me
    about how this would impact  on  his  evidence  or  on  his  return  to
    Somalia.

28.  I have considered the appellant's conduct at the  last  hearing  before
    me. The hearing was  abandoned  as  a  result  of  concerns  about  the
    appellant's mental health. Considering this,  the  NHS  notes  and  the
    evidence generally, I conclude that the appellant is  manipulative  and
    has exaggerated his mental health problems in order to boost his  case.
    He is clearly concerned and depressed about the prospect of deportation
    to Somalia but this is only to be expected in the  circumstances.   The
    appellant conceded that he was dishonest to the  author  of  the  OASys
    Report and it was clear that he had a motive in telling  the  probation
    officer that he had been employed previously as a cleaner.

29.  The appellant's evidence is wholly unreliable. He has  not  established
    that his mother is deceased.  I can see no motivation for  him  telling
    the author of the report that his mother was in Somalia.   He  has  not
    established that he does not have relatives in Somalia and he  has  not
    established that his family here in the UK would not be able to support
    him.  He stated that the family are willing to assist him here if he is
    released. From what  the  appellant  told  the  probation  officer  his
    cousins have assisted him historically. He has not given clear evidence
    about the means of support during his time in  the  UK.   There  is  no
    clear evidence that would explain why  this  assistance  could  not  be
    provided  in  Somalia.  The  appellant's  case  is  that  he  has  been
    unemployed  here  since  leaving  college  but  there  is  no  evidence
    establishing how he has supported himself here.  If indeed he has  been
    reliant on benefits he would have been able  to  provide  corroborative
    evidence.   He has not established he has not been employed here  since
    he left school or that there is any reason why he would  be  unable  to
    find  employment  here   notwithstanding   having   a   mild   learning
    difficulties.

30.  I have taken into account the appellant's  evidence  relating  to  clan
    membership. He told FtT Judge Robinson that he  was  unsure  about  his
    clan membership but had been told that he was  Bravenese.  In  evidence
    before me he said that he did not know what clan he was  from.   In  my
    view this is another attempt to distance himself from association  with
    Somalia.  I conclude that I am unable to accept  the  evidence  of  the
    appellant as regards clan membership. He has not established that he is
    from a minority clan and that he would not on return be able to  access
    support.

31.  There is evidence of depression and mild learning disabilities  but  no
    evidence explaining how this would impact on the appellant  ability  to
    give consistent evidence. There is no evidence to explain how it  would
    impact on his behaviour on return to Somalia and his  ability  to  find
    work here or indeed in Somalia.  I find that there is  no  good  reason
    why the appellant cannot obtain low level work for himself in  Somalia.
    The evidence does not establish that should the appellant  be  returned
    to Somalia he would be treated as a vulnerable person and would  be  at
    risk as a result of this.

32.  The Court of Appeal in SSHD v Said concluded that the country  guidance
    case of MOJ was  limited  to  whether  Somali  nationals  relocated  to
    Mogadishu could succeed in  claims  for  refugee  status,  humanitarian
    protection status under Directive 2004/83 Art.15(c) or under Article  2
    or Article 3 of the Convention purely  on  the  basis  that  they  were
    civilians without adequate protection. Mr Sharma  indicated  that  this
    was not a destitution case, but the evidence does  not  establish  that
    the appellant's individual circumstances are such that he would attract
    an attack from Al Shabaab or would be vulnerable to  recruitment.   The
    applicant has not established that removal would violate Article  3  on
    the basis of the evidence applying Sufi and Elmi v UK 54 EHRR.

33.  The evidence does not establish that the appellant will be  obliged  to
    live in an IDP camp, but in any event if he were to face this  it  does
    not necessarily mean that there will be a breach of Article  3.   I  do
    not  accept  the  appellant's  evidence  in   relation   to   potential
    employment,  clan  and  or  family  support  and  the  availability  of
    remittances.  I find that the appellant would have sufficient  finances
    to establish himself in  Mogadishu  despite  his  depression  and  mild
    learning difficulties.  He has not shown that he is likely to end up in
    an IDP camp and his circumstances are not such that would preclude  his
    removal to Somalia on Article 3 grounds. The appellant would be  unable
    to bring himself within the rubric of para 408 of MOJ.

34.   In relation to paragraph 399A of the Immigration Rules  it  is  agreed
    that the appellant has been lawfully resident in the UK for most of his
    life.  I do not find that he has established that he  is  socially  and
    culturally integrated in  the  UK.   I  have  taken  into  account  his
    appalling criminal record and that he has recently spent  a  period  of
    time in custody.  He has failed to comply with the requirements of  the
    sex offender's register.  His evidence is such that it is not  possible
    to make a finding whether he has or has not worked  here.  There  is  a
    dearth of evidence that he is socially and culturally integrated in the
    UK over and above the lengthy residence here.  He has  not  established
    that there would be significant obstacles to his  integration  for  the
    reasons that I have given above.

35.  The appellant has failed  to  identify  very  compelling  circumstances
    over and above those described in paragraph 399A. The fact that he  has
    been here since a child and that he has mild learning  difficulties  do
    not in this case amount to  compelling  circumstances.  The  appeal  is
    dismissed under the Rules. The appellant does not fall  within  any  of
    the exceptions under the Rules which are replicated in Section 117C  of
    the 2002 Act.

36.  The appeal is dismissed under Article 3 and Article 8.
