For the Respondent:        Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
The Applications

1.   The Appellants are all citizens of Pakistan.  The first  Appellant  who
    I shall refer to as Mrs Siddiqui was born on 11th February  1977.   The
    second Appellant who I shall refer to as K was born in 2001 and is  Mrs
    Siddiqui's daughter.  The third Appellant who I shall refer  to  as  Ms
    Khatoon was born on 1st January 1982.  The Appellants appealed  against
    decisions of the Respondent dated 3rd May 2013.  In  the  case  of  Mrs
    Siddiqui and Ms Khatoon this was to refuse them leave to remain as Tier
    1 Entrepreneur Migrants under the points-based system.  In the case  of
    K this was as the dependant of Mrs Siddiqui.  The appeals against those
    decisions were dismissed by Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Walters
    sitting at Taylor House on 16th August 2013.  Permission to appeal  was
    granted to the Appellants  on  25th  September  2013  and  the  matters
    therefore come before me in the first instance to decide whether  there
    is an error of law in the First-tier Tribunal's decision such  that  it
    falls to be set aside and the appeals reheard.

2.   Mrs Siddiqui entered the United Kingdom on 30th July  2011  with  leave
    to enter as a Tier 4 General Student Migrant valid until  30th  October
    2012.  Ms Khatoon entered the United Kingdom on  17th  June  2011  also
    with leave to enter as a Tier 4 General  Student  Migrant  valid  until
    14th October 2013.  Ms Khatoon's leave was  curtailed  on  16th  August
    2012 such that it expired on 15th October 2012.  On 14th September 2012
    Mrs Siddiqui and Ms Khatoon made a combined application  for  leave  to
    remain as Tier 1 Entrepreneur Migrants and for  a  biometric  residence
    permit. Paragraph 245DD  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  table  4  of
    Appendix A set out the requirements to be met in this  category.   Both
    Appellants were required to  score  75  points  under  Appendix  A  for
    attributes and provide the specified documents.  The burden of proof of
    establishing that the requirements were met rested upon the  Appellants
    in this case that the Appellants could show they  have  access  to  not
    less than �200,000  No argument has been made in  this  case  that  the
    Appellants would be able to meet the alternative criteria  set  out  in
    Table 4 (where a lesser sum of �50,000 has to be shown).

3.   The Appellants' claimed 75  points  stating  that  they  were  able  to
    provide the original of a letter from Barclays  Bank  Plc  in  Pakistan
    (dated 7th September 2012) relating to a Mr Manghan Mal and  Mrs  Ganga
    Bai ("the third-party investors") who were husband  and  wife  and  who
    held a joint account equivalent to �206,678 sterling in Pakistan.   The
    Appellants produced a declaration from the third party investors and  a
    letter from their legal representative Mr Irfan Afzali. The letter from
    Barclays Bank was addressed to the Respondent and confirmed that Mr Mal
    was a valued customer of the bank maintaining a  savings  account  with
    them with the specified balance.

The Proceedings at First Instance

4.   The Respondent refused  stated  that  the  letter  from  Barclays  Bank
    Pakistan  did  not  confirm  the  amount  of  money  available  to  the
    Appellants because it did not specify their name as  requested  in  the
    Tier 1 Entrepreneur policy guidance.  As a result  the  Respondent  did
    not award 25 points for access  to  funds  and  it  followed  that  the
    Respondent did not award 25  points  for  funds  held  in  a  regulated
    financial institution or disposable in the United Kingdom.

5.   The Appellants appealed against the decisions  arguing  that  they  had
    provided all the required documents but the Respondent had not followed
    her own policy of evidential flexibility which allowed case workers  to
    contact applicants for missing documents  or  to  correct  errors  once
    applications had been lodged.  As a result the Respondent  had  handled
    the applications unfairly.  The grounds also raised an  argument  under
    Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life) but  this  was
    not pursued at first instance nor in the grounds of  onward  appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal and nor was it raised before me.

6.   At the hearing at first instance Counsel for  the  Appellants  (who  at
    that time was instructed on behalf of all three) relied on paragraph 41-
    SD of Appendix A which specified that one  or  more  of  the  following
    documents had to be produced: a letter from each financial  institution
    holding the funds to confirm the  amount  of  money  available  to  the
    applicant or the entrepreneurial team if applying under the  provisions
    of  paragraph  52  of  this  Appendix.   Each  letter  must  state  the
    applicant's name and his team partner's name and confirm the amount  of
    money provided to the applicant from any third  party  (if  applicable)
    that is held in that institution.  I pause to note here that  this  was
    the wording which applied at the date  of  decision  and  the  date  of
    hearing before the Judge at first instance.  Subsequently paragraph 41-
    SD was amended on  1st  October  2013  but  those  amendments  are  not
    relevant for the purposes of this hearing.  The  Appellants  could  not
    satisfy the requirement of paragraph  41-SD  because  it  was  not  the
    policy of Barclays Bank to provide  information  to  those  other  than
    their customers, it was thus  impossible  to  provide  a  letter  which
    complied with the above requirements.

7.   The Judge did not accept that last submission  commenting  that  all  a
    letter from a bank had to say was that the Appellants had authority  to
    access up to the equivalent of �200,000 from that account. He dismissed
    the appeal finding that this was not a case to which  the  Respondent's
    evidential flexibility policy as set  out  in  the  case  of  Rodriguez
    [2013] UKUT 00042 would apply. He suggested one way round might  be  to
    execute a power of attorney (although it  does  not  appear  that  that
    point was raised in argument before him).  At paragraph  15  the  Judge
    stated:

         "If funds are held by a third party then it is  a  matter  for  the
         Appellants to prove that they can get access to those  funds.   The
         other alternative of course would be for  Mr  Mal  and  Ms  Bai  to
         transfer the money to an account in the Appellants' names.  However
         this is a matter which the Appellants have to prove and unless they
         can do so their application is bound to fail.  I did not find  that
         the Respondent is under any duty to write  to  the  Appellants  and
         point out to them that the evidence they have submitted simply does
         not show that they have access to the funds in the Barclays account
         in Pakistan.  I found this to be especially so as the option always
         exists for the funds to be transferred to a bank in  the  UK  where
         the Appellants have an account."

8.    The  Appellants  appealed  against  that  decision  arguing  that  the
    requirement in paragraph 41-SD that the  Barclays  Bank  letter  should
    have stated the Appellants' names was impossible  to  comply  with  and
    thus  irrational  and  unlawful.   The  Judge's  suggestion  that   the
    Appellants might execute a power of attorney  was  procedurally  unfair
    and had not been canvassed in submissions. More importantly it was  not
    reasonable to expect the third-party investors to pass the  conduct  of
    their financial affairs over to the Appellants in whose  business  they
    would  seek  to  invest.   It  was  perfectly  permissible  under   the
    Immigration Rules for funds to be held abroad and they did not have  to
    be transferred to the United Kingdom.

9.   Citing at some length from the case of Rodriguez the grounds of  onward
    appeal drew attention to a passage in the judgment in which  the  Upper
    Tribunal had said:

         "We consider that properly construed and evaluated in its  entirety
         the policy enunciated in the letter [dated 19th May  2011  from  Mr
         Jeremy Oppenheim a UKBA official] required the Respondent to notify
         the Appellant of the informational shortcomings in her  application
         and to afford her the opportunity  of  rectification  and  addition
         prior to an adverse determination".

     There was no  evidence  to  suggest  that  the  evidential  flexibility
    policy had been withdrawn.  There were  informational  shortcomings  in
    the Appellants' original Tier 1 applications  but  no  opportunity  had
    been provided to them to remedy the same. There was  no  indication  in
    the refusal letter that the Respondent had directed  her  mind  to  the
    evidential flexibility policy when  refusing  the  applications.  As  a
    minimum alertness to the policy was required. This of  itself  rendered
    the Respondent's decision unlawful this being no in accordance with the
    law.

10.  The application for permission to  appeal  came  before  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Hemingway on  25th  September  2013.   In  granting
    permission to appeal he wrote:

         "It is arguable the Judge erred in failing to properly explain  why
         the evidential flexibility policy was not applicable and in failing
         to apply it.  It is arguable the Judge erred in purporting to apply
         'policy guidance'.  It is also arguable though not raised that  the
         removal aspect of the decisions was unlawful."

     I pause to note here that although that point  was  not  argued  before
    me, the removal decisions in this case were made before  8th  May  2013
    thus were caught by the ratio of the Court of Appeal in the decision of
    Ahmadi and were therefore not in accordance with the law.

The Hearing before Me

11.  At this hearing it was agreed that the correct approach to this  appeal
    was either that the Judge had made no error of law or if he had because
    he was wrong about the evidential flexibility  policy  the  Appellants'
    appeals should be allowed to the extent that the Respondent's decisions
    were found to be not in accordance with the law and thus  still  before
    the Respondent to make.   There  was  no  need  for  any  further  oral
    evidence.

12.  It was argued by Counsel for Mrs Siddiqui that the Judge had not  given
    adequate reasons to explain why the evidential  flexibility  policy  or
    indeed the requirements of paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules did
    not apply in this case.  Paragraph 245AA which  the  Appellants  argued
    was more restrictive than the policy referred to in Rodriguez  provides
    that the Respondent will only consider documents  submitted  after  the
    application if there is for example a sequence of documents and some of
    the documents in the sequence have been omitted or a document is in the
    wrong format.  The  Respondent  will  not  request  documents  where  a
    specified document has  not  been  submitted  for  example  an  English
    language certificate is missing or where the UK Border Agency does  not
    anticipate that addressing the omission or error referred to would lead
    to a grant because the application would be refused for other  reasons.
    If the applicant has submitted a specified document in the wrong format
    the application may be granted exceptionally providing  the  Respondent
    is satisfied that the specified documents are genuine and the applicant
    meets all the other requirements.

13.  Counsel submitted that if  the  Appellants  had  been  alerted  to  the
    difficulty with the letter from Barclays Bank  they  could  have  taken
    steps to remedy the problem, for example, within trust law or,  as  the
    Judge suggested, have a power of attorney executed.  What  was  missing
    in  this  case  was  one  piece  of  information,  the  names  of   the
    entrepreneurs.  There was no prohibition on an applicant producing  new
    documents to the Respondent when asked and in any event under paragraph
    245AA there was a general discretion to still  allow  the  application.
    There was other information before the decision maker to indicate  that
    the Appellants could submit information which had the effect of filling
    in the gaps in the Barclays Bank document.

14.  For Ms Khatoon Counsel argued that under paragraph 41-SD of Appendix  A
    the criteria for third-party funds had been satisfied but  this  aspect
    of the Rules had not been addressed by  the  Judge.   Subparagraph  (b)
    stated there had to be a declaration from the third-party that they had
    made the money available for the applicants to invest in a business  in
    the United Kingdom.  This was in the form of the letters signed in  the
    presence of the Pakistan lawyer Mr Afzali enclosed  with  the  original
    Tier 1 Entrepreneur application forms dated  6th  September  2012.  The
    third party investors stated that they were friends of  the  Appellants
    and they each had �101,555 and would make it equally available  to  the
    Appellants.  Their signatures had been verified by Mr Afzali.

15.  For the Respondent it  was  argued  that  the  Appellants'  submissions
    misunderstood the position under  the  evidential  flexibility  policy.
    The letter from Mr Oppenheim referred to the Respondent's system  which
    allowed  case  workers  to  contact  applicants  to   request   further
    documentation or clarification where appropriate. It was talking  about
    whether or not an application would be rejected not about a substantive
    consideration of the merits of the application.  Under the  policy  the
    Respondent would not seek clarification or further  evidence  where  it
    did not exist.  That was the situation in the instant case.  No  effort
    had been made by the Appellants to show that  they  could  satisfy  the
    Immigration Rules.  This was not a case where for  example  a  document
    was missing from a sequence and this was  not  a  situation  where  the
    requirements of paragraph 245AA applied at all.  The issue was  whether
    the Appellants could access the funds and it could not be inferred that
    they had access to it.  The deficit in the Appellants'  evidence  could
    not be made good by other evidence placed before the  Respondent.   The
    bank letter did not show the Appellants had an ability  to  access  the
    funds and there was no error in the Respondent's decision.

16.  In closing for Ms Khatoon reference was made to subparagraph  (b)(i)(9)
    of  the  former  wording  to  Appendix  41-SD  which  referred   to   a
    confirmation that the money would remain available  to  the  applicants
    until such time as it was transferred to them or their business.   This
    implied that it was not necessary for the Appellants  to  already  have
    had the money transferred to them.

Findings

17.  To satisfy the requirements in this case the  Appellants  had  to  show
    that �200,000 was available to them  to  invest  in  a  business.   The
    letter from Barclays Bank which I have quoted above does not  do  this.
    It confirms that the third party investors have over �200,000 in  their
    own account.  The Appellants'  first  argument  is  that  this  was  an
    information shortcoming and that the Respondent  should  have  complied
    with the evidential flexibility policy and asked for  more  information
    before coming to a decision  on  whether  to  reject  the  application.
    Confirmation that the Appellants had access to  the  funds  had  simply
    been omitted from the application.

18.  However a query from the Respondent would have required the  Appellants
    to obtain further evidence not then  in  existence  to  deal  with  the
    point.  It is argued that there is nothing to  prevent  the  Respondent
    from asking for this but equally there is no indication in  either  the
    evidential flexibility policy or paragraph 245AA that the Respondent is
    under any requirement to ask for  documentation  which  does  not  then
    exist.  If a case worker is not satisfied that the  evidence  which  is
    missing does not exist the evidential  flexibility  policy  at  step  3
    states that evidence cannot be requested and the application should  be
    refused.  Similarly paragraph 245AA(c) states that the Respondent  will
    not  request  documents  where  a  specified  document  has  not   been
    submitted.

19.  In this case the specified document that  should  have  been  submitted
    was evidence from the bank that the Appellants had access to  �200,000.
    That had not been submitted.  It did not exist and there was no  burden
    on the Respondent to request such documents.  In my view the Judge  was
    right in holding that the evidential flexibility policy did  not  apply
    in this case and (notwithstanding the brevity of his observations)  his
    overall conclusion was sound.  The Appellants rely on  a  passage  from
    Rodriguez  at  paragraph  12  that  the  flexibility  policy   heralded
    unequivocally the introduction of a new practice whereby all applicants
    would be notified of the  absence  of  mandatory  evidence  from  their
    applications and would be given the opportunity to rectify the relevant
    shortcoming prior to rejection.

20.  It should be borne in mind however that the letter  from  Mr  Oppenheim
    states that applicants would be contacted "where appropriate".  What is
    or is not appropriate depends on  the  wording  of  the  policy  itself
    and/or the wording of  the  relevant  Immigration  Rules.   As  I  have
    indicated above the wording of both the policy and the Rules  does  not
    require the Respondent to ask for documents that do not exist.  It  may
    well be that if the Respondent does ask for such documents there is  no
    bar on the Appellant producing them but that  is  different  to  saying
    that there is a requirement on  the  Respondent  to  ask  whether  such
    documents can be obtained and the decision is not  in  accordance  with
    the law unless the Respondent has done that.

21.  The second point made by the Appellants (made by Mr Balroop  on  behalf
    of the third Appellant but I assume adopted by Mr Richardson on  behalf
    of the first Appellant) was that the declarations from the third  party
    investors was sufficient  to  meet  the  Rules  because  they  met  the
    requirements of paragraph 41-SD(b).  This assumes that subparagraph (b)
    is in the alternative to subparagraph (a).   For  the  reasons  I  have
    already given I do not find that the Appellants  are  able  to  satisfy
    subparagraph (a).  I do not accept the  implication  that  subparagraph
    (b) of paragraph 41-SD is in someway in the alternative.  The documents
    from the investors may well satisfy the  requirements  of  subparagraph
    (b) but that does not relieve the Appellants of the  responsibility  of
    showing that they are entitled to access monies held in the bank.   Nor
    does it show that there was an omission which could be rectified  by  a
    request under the policy because the investors were  prepared  to  make
    the �200,000 in their accounts available to the Appellants.

22.  Whilst I agree it was not  for  the  Judge  to  speculate  on  how  the
    Appellants could satisfy the requirement to show they had access to the
    funds in the bank, equally it was not an  unreasonable  requirement  of
    the Respondent contained in the Rules that some evidence of ability  to
    access funds in a bank account be shown.  It is self-evident  that  the
    Respondent needs to know that the particular applicant can  access  the
    particular funds.   Otherwise  there  is  nothing  to  stop  a  wealthy
    individual who has over �200,000  declaring  the  same  in  support  of
    multiple applications under the Tier 1 Entrepreneur system. That  would
    be an abuse of the scheme as the applications relying  on  such  monies
    would not be genuine applications.

23.  It was not for the Judge to specify what the  Appellants  could  do  to
    rectify the position but the plain fact of the  matter  was  that  they
    have still not  done  anything  to  show  that  they  can  rectify  the
    position.  They simply rely on what they submitted  to  the  Respondent
    that there are two wealthy individuals who between them have  �200,000.
    It is not a requirement that those individuals transfer the �200,000 to
    the Appellants now but it is a requirement that  some  evidence  of  an
    ability to access the money is shown and this the Appellants failed  to
    do. Although the Rules indicate that the  Respondent  can  nevertheless
    grant an application even if otherwise it might fail, that  is  subject
    to severe  restrictions  (see  paragraph  12  above)  which  render  it
    inapplicable in the instant case. This was not a case of a document  in
    the wrong format.

24.  I do not accept the interpretation  of  the  case  of  Rodriguez  which
    amounts to a submission that in effect the Respondent can never  refuse
    a points-based system application if no request has  been  made  to  an
    applicant.  These Appellants could not  satisfy  the  Rules  and  still
    cannot.  Whilst it is arguable that  the  Judge  could  have  explained
    himself in more detail, I do not accept that his reasoning reveals  any
    material error of law such that his determination should be set  aside.
    He did not deal with the point in relation to paragraph 41-SD(b) but it
    does not appear to have been raised before him and in any event,  as  I
    have decided, is not relevant to the outcome in this case.



Decision

The decision of the Judge did not involve the making of a material error  of
law and I dismiss the Appellants' appeals against  his  determination  which
will stand.

Appeals dismissed.

I make no anonymity orders (save in relation to  the  second  Appellant)  as
there is no public policy reason so to order.
