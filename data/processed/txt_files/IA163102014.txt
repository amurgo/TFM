Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Mills, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No appearance or representation


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In the decision the Appellant  is  referred  to  as  the  Secretary  of
    State.  The Respondent is referred to as  the  Claimant.  Appellant,  a
    national of Jamaica, appealed against the Respondent's decision dated 3
    April 2014 to refuse leave to enter for the purposes of a visa visit.

2.   The basis of  refusal  was  in  the  alternative  in  that  either  the
    claimant, Mr Miller, had  made  false  representations  concerning  the
    intended visit, and its length in particular, or that the Appellant had
    failed to show that he had made proper provision in terms of his family
    and in relation to his employment so as to give  rise  to  the  concern
    that he did not intend to leave at the conclusion of the visit and  had
    misrepresented his domestic circumstances to obtain entry clearance.

3.   His appeal came before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Obhi,  the  Judge,
    whose decision [D], on 3  September  2014,  only  addressed  the  first
    issue, namely whether the Appellant had misrepresented to the  ECO,  or
    alternatively to the Immigration Officer,  his  intentions.  The  judge
    accepted that the Appellant had been naï¿½ve and in all the circumstances
    which he addressed had not sought to use deception or intend to deceive
    as to the length of his visit.

4.   However, what the judge did not do in considering the matter  was  take
    into account that the entry clearance application had been made on  the
    basis of it being a four week visit.  Therefore the assessment  of  his
    financial needs whilst in the United Kingdom were plainly likely to  be
    materially different if the Appellant was visiting for  ten  weeks  let
    alone intending to stay for six months.  The judge did  not  take  such
    factors into consideration.

5.   Further, in assessing that issue the judge did not  take  into  account
    the fact that the Appellant had obtained a four week holiday  with  the
    consent of his employer and/or been given ten weeks holiday.   But  the
    Appellant certainly had not obtained  any  consent  from  the  employer
    either to preserve his job or to make financial provision for his  wife
    and family by leaving for a period of six months.

6.   I find the judge's failure to address those issues render  the  judge's
    conclusion unsafe and amounted to a material error  of  law.   Further,
    the judge did not deal with the issue in the alternative of the refusal
    by reference to the length of stay for six  months  and  its  potential
    impact in terms of a change in circumstances since  the  original  visa
    was issued.  Therefore it is plain, as the initial decision made clear,
    that the matter fell to be considered under paragraph 321(i)  and  (ii)
    of the Immigration Rules.  The Judge's failure to do so  was  similarly
    an error of law.

7.   Accordingly I was  satisfied  that  the  judge's  omissions  meant  the
    Original Tribunal's decision cannot stand and the matter would have  to
    be remade. I was  satisfied  that  it  was  appropriate,  applying  the
    Presidential Guidance that the matter should be dealt with in the Upper
    Tribunal.

8.   With the grant of permission  directions  were  given  but  no  further
    representations have been received by or on behalf  of  the  Appellant,
    nor did the Sponsor attend or make any representations  concerning  the
    matter.  In the circumstances I have considered whether or  not  it  is
    appropriate to proceed in the absence of the Appellant.

9.   I am satisfied the Appellant had voluntarily absented himself from  the
    process, has not provided any  information  to  support  his  case.  He
    previously had made representations through solicitors.  They ceased to
    act  and notified the Tribunal on 22 July 2015, after  receipt  of  the
    notice of hearing for today's hearing, that they no longer acted.  They
    confirmed the Appellant's address as recorded on the case  file;  being
    that of the UK Sponsor.  I am satisfied that by first-class post proper
    and reasonable notice of the hearing had been served on  the  Appellant
    and Sponsor. In  the absence of further information or response I  find
    that the Appellant has either through removal or  departure  no  longer
    taken any interest in the outcome of the appeal. In those circumstances
    I find, having regard to the overriding objective, that  the  fair  and
    just course is for this appeal to be disposed of.

10.  I find, in the absence of evidence to properly explain the  Appellant's
    circumstances, that the appeal against  the  adverse  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State (dated 3 April 2014) is dismissed.

The appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction was sought or is necessary.
