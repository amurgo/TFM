                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Doyle made following a hearing at Bradford on 16th February 2015.

Background

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Pakistan born on  21st  August  1987.   He
    applied to come to the UK as a spouse but was refused on 18th September
    2014 on the grounds that he could not meet the maintenance requirements
    of the Rules.

 3. The sponsor was employed from 1st July 2013  and  left  on  14th  March
    2014, with a gross salary of �14,040.  She earned �270 per  week  gross
    and �237 net and put �200 into her bank account. On 17th March 2014 she
    took up fresh employment, where she remains, and earns a  gross  salary
    of �16,980.  In addition she receives �5,400 per annum  rental  income,
    all of which goes into her bank account.

 4. The judge was satisfied that the sponsor had an  income  of  more  than
    �18,600 per annum and allowed the appeal.

 5. The Secretary of State now challenges that decision on the grounds that
    the judge failed to realise that the claimant could only  rely  on  the
    sponsor's income as demonstrated  by  specified  evidence  set  out  in
    Appendix FM/SE.  Only wages paid into a bank account and  appearing  on
    the bank statements may be counted towards the sponsor's  gross  income
    in accordance with the  evidence  of  financial  requirements  1(n)  of
    Appendix FM/SE.  On that  basis,  the  sponsor  had,  at  the  date  of
    decision, only an annual  income  of  �10,400  from  her  salary  which
    together with the rental income was below the required threshold.

 6. Under FM/SE(1)(n) the gross amount of any cash income may  be  counted,
    where the person's specified bank statements show the net amount  which
    relates to the gross amount shown on their payslips (or in the relevant
    specified  evidence  provided  in  addition  to  the   specified   bank
    statements in relation to non-employment income).  Otherwise  only  the
    net income shown on the specified bank statements may be counted.

 7. The sponsor actually changed employment on 17th March  2014  i.e.  just
    over six months before the date of decision and  her  full  wages  from
    that time went straight into the account.  However under  Section  2(a)
    of Appendix FM/SE payslips must cover a period of six months  prior  to
    the date of application if the person has been employed by the  current
    employer for at least six months.

 8. The application was made in January 2014  and  therefore  the  relevant
    payslips were the former wages, only �200 per week which were put  into
    the bank account.

 9. The judge therefore erred in law in failing to take  into  account  the
    provisions of Appendix FM/SE.

10. It appears that the sponsor does earn a sufficient income to  meet  the
    requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  and,  providing  that  it  is
    properly evidenced, there is no reason why a second application  should
    not be successful.

Notice of Decision

11. The original judge erred in law.   His  decision  is  set  aside.   The
    claimant's appeal is dismissed.

12. No anonymity direction is made.
