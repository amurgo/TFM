                     The Entry Clearance Officer Beijing

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr C Timson, instructed by Sandbrook Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, bin Xue, asserted date of birth 1.10.95, is a citizen of
    China.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Shimmin promulgated 20.11.14, dismissing his appeal  against  the
    decision of the Entry Clearance Officer to refuse him  entry  clearance
    to the United Kingdom as the son of his sponsor Qing Yun He, a  British
    citizen, pursuant to paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules.  The Judge
    heard the appeal on 27.10.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Chohan  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    16.2.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 28.4.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Shimmin should be set aside.

 6. Judge Shimmin dismissed the appeal because he was not satisfied that:

      a) The appellant was under the age of 18 at date of application;

      b) That he was not leading an independent life;

      c) That his mother had sole responsibility for him;

      d)  That  there  were  serious  and   compelling   family   or   other
         considerations  making  the  appellant's  exclusion  from  the   UK
         undesirable;

      e) In the light of those findings the judge did not find it  necessary
         to consider the  other  issues  raised  in  the  refusal  decision,
         including maintenance and accommodation;

      f) That the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer did not breach the
         appellant's and/or the sponsor's article 8 ECHR rights  to  respect
         for private and family life.

 7. I have  carefully  considered  the  three  grounds  of  appeal  in  the
    application for permission to appeal:

      a) Ground 1 challenges the conclusion that the appellant is  over  the
         age of 18 on the basis that the judge failed to take account of the
         appellant's Chinese passport which shows that he was under the  age
         of 18 at the date of application.

      b) Ground 2 challenges the conclusion that the appellant was living an
         independent life;

      c) Ground 3 challenges the article 8 part of the  decision,  asserting
         that the judge misdirected himself as to the correct test.

 8. I note that the grounds do not challenge the findings  in  relation  to
    sole responsibility under 297(e) at �30 of the decision, or in relation
    to compelling circumstances under 297(f) at �31. Mr Timson argued  that
    those were not part of the reasons for refusal by the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer, but that is not accurate as  it  is  clear  from  the  refusal
    decision that the Entry Clearance  Officer  found  that  the  appellant
    failed to demonstrate that he met both of those issues. In  any  event,
    they are essential 'ingredients' for success under  paragraph  297  and
    the judge was entitled to make findings in relation  to  them.  In  the
    circumstances, regardless of any alleged errors of law, those parts  of
    the decision must stand. It follows that  whether  or  not  there  were
    errors of law in relation to the age of the appellant and the  question
    of an independent life, the appeal could not  succeed  under  paragraph
    297 of the Immigration Rules. The alleged errors of law in  respect  of
    failing to specifically consider that the passport held  the  appellant
    age are therefore immaterial to the outcome of the appeal.

 9. Mr Timson submitted that that failure infected  the  other  credibility
    findings and that had the judge taken into account  that  the  passport
    proved his age those other credibility findings might have been decided
    differently. That is a weak argument on the facts of  this  case  where
    the evidence very clearly  demonstrated  credibility  issues  with  the
    appellant's case. As Mr McVeety pointed out, on the  sponsor's  claimed
    age she would have had to be 11 years of age  at  the  time  of  giving
    birth to the appellant, perhaps why the Entry  Clearance  Officer  took
    the unusual step  of  sending  out  investigators  to  the  appellant's
    village to ascertain  what  his  grandfather  said,  which  was  almost
    entirely inconsistent with the appellant's case. This was in effect  an
    application which was doomed to failure from the outset.  The  evidence
    against the appellant is so overwhelming when  considered  as  a  whole
    that it cannot be said that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was
    irrational or perverse, or that any other  Tribunal  even  taking  into
    account the passport claim of age could  or  would  have  come  to  any
    different decision.

10. In any event, I do not find any error of law in  the  findings  of  the
    judge as to the appellant's age. At �18 the judge explained that he had
    carefully considered all the  evidence,  whether  or  not  specifically
    mentioned in the decision. Even if the  judge  had  forgotten  to  take
    account of the passport it was but only one factor to consider  in  the
    light of the absence of any documentation generated at the time of  the
    appellant's birth together with the general  findings  on  credibility,
    which led the judge to  conclude  that  the  appellant  had  failed  to
    discharge the burden on him to demonstrate that he was still  under  18
    at the date of decision.

11. In relation to article 8, the grounds assert that the judge confused an
    application considered under  Appendix  FM  and  an  application  under
    another part of the immigration rules. It is not clear what is meant by
    this assertion in �17 of the application for permission to  appeal.  At
    �37  the  judge  concluded  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules in respect of private and family life,  which
    was a reference to Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE. No submission  was
    made to me that he could so, and  indeed  Mr  Timson  did  not  address
    article 8 at all in his submissions.

12. The First-tier Tribunal judge considered whether there was any need  to
    go to consider article 8  outside  the  Rules,  because  of  compelling
    circumstances insufficiently recognised under the Rules  but  concluded
    that there were no  such  circumstances.  The  approach  has  moved  on
    somewhat since the date of the hearing, but in the recent case of Singh
    v  SSHD  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  74,  the  Court  of  Appeal  endorsed   the
    Isuazu/Nagre approach that there is no purpose in considering article 8
    outside the Rules if there is no good arguable case for granting  leave
    outside the Rules by reference to article 8 and the Rules in respect of
    article 8 have addressed the family and private life issues.

13. In any event, in going on to make an article  8  assessment  the  judge
    noted that the appellant's mother chose to leave the appellant in China
    many years ago. They have remained in contact by various means and that
    level of contact can continue. Having found that the  appellant  is  an
    adult at the date of decision, the judge concluded that  there  was  no
    dependency between mother and appellant beyond  normal  emotional  ties
    and thus that there was no breach of article 8 ECHR. It is quite  clear
    from the unchallenged evidence of the grandfather  that  the  appellant
    was leading an independent life, whether or not he had reached the  age
    of 18. There was no basis on which the Tribunal could  reasonably  have
    concluded that the relationship between mother and son  was  such  that
    the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer to refuse  entry  clearance
    amounted to such a grave interference with family life so as to  engage
    article 8.

14. In the circumstances, even if article 8 ECHR  had  been  argued  in  Mr
    Timson's submissions, which it was not, there was no real  prospect  of
    success under article 8 on the facts of this case as found by the First-
    tier Tribunal, irrespective of the issue as to age.

Conclusion & Decision:

15. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of  any  material
    error on a point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
