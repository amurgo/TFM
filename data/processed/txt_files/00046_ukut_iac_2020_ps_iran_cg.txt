                       Legal Department

                              COUNTRY GUIDANCE

 1. This country guidance applies to protection claims  from  Iranians  who
    claim to have converted from Islam to Christianity.


 2. Insofar as they relate to non-ethnic Christians, this decision replaces
    the country guidance decisions in  FS  and  Others  (Iran  -  Christian
    Converts) Iran CG [2004] UKIAT 00303 and SZ and  JM  (Christians  -  FS
    confirmed) Iran CG [2008]  UKAIT  00082  which  are  no  longer  to  be
    followed.

 3. Decision makers should begin by determining whether  the  claimant  has
    demonstrated that  it  is  reasonably  likely  that  he  or  she  is  a
    Christian.  If that burden is discharged the  following  considerations
    apply:

             i) A convert to Christianity seeking to  openly  practice  that
                faith in Iran would face a real risk of persecution.


            ii) If the claimant would in fact conceal his  faith,  decision-
                makers should consider why.  If any part of  the  claimant's
                motivation is a fear of such persecution, the appeal  should
                be allowed.


           iii) If the claimant would choose to conceal his faith purely for
                other reasons (family pressure, social constraints, personal
                preference etc)  then  protection  should  be  refused.  The
                evidence demonstrates that  private  and  solitary  worship,
                within the confines of the home, is possible and  would  not
                in general entail a real risk of persecution.

 4. In cases where the claimant is found to be  insincere  in  his  or  her
    claimed conversion, there is  not  a  real  risk  of  persecution  'in-
    country'. There being no reason for such  an  individual  to  associate
    himself with Christians, there is not a real risk that he would come to
    the adverse attention of the Iranian authorities. Decision-makers  must
    nevertheless consider the possible risks arising at the  'pinch  point'
    of arrival:


             i) All returning failed asylum seekers are subject to
                questioning on arrival, and this will include questions
                about why they claimed asylum;


            ii) A returnee who divulges that he claimed to be a Christian is
                reasonably likely to be transferred for further questioning;


           iii) The returnee can be expected to sign an undertaking
                renouncing his claimed Christianity. The questioning will
                therefore in general be short and will not entail a real
                risk of ill-treatment;


            iv) If there are any reasons why the detention becomes
                prolonged, the risk of ill-treatment will correspondingly
                rise. Factors that could result in prolonged detention must
                be determined on a case by case basis. They could include
                but are not limited to:

                   a) Previous adverse contact with  the  Iranian  security
                      services;


                   b) Connection to persons  of  interest  to  the  Iranian
                      authorities;


                   c) Attendance at a church with perceived  connection  to
                      Iranian house churches;


                   d)  Overt  social  media  content  indicating  that  the
                      individual   concerned    has    actively    promoted
                      Christianity.

                             ANONYMITY DIRECTION



     Having had  regard  to  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
     Tribunal) Rules 2008 and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of  2013:
     Anonymity Orders, we consider it appropriate to make an order  in  the
     following terms:


        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal has been designated as 'country guidance' on Iran  so  that
    the Upper Tribunal may address two interrelated questions.


 2.  First,  has  the  situation  in  Iran  for  'ordinary'   converts   to
    Christianity changed since the decision in SZ and JM (Christians  -  FS
    confirmed) Iran CG [2008] UKAIT 00082? Second, is there a real risk  of
    persecution for  persons  who  have  engaged  in  Christian  activities
    abroad, regardless of whether such individuals hold a genuine religious
    belief in Christianity?


 3. In respect of the Appellant PS it was the  second  of  these  questions
    that brought his appeal before  the  Upper  Tribunal.  Although  it  is
    accepted that PS was baptised as a Christian in 2015, and that  he  has
    attended church, it is not accepted that he is a  genuine  adherent  of
    the Christian  faith.  His  conversion  was  found  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  to  be  a  cynical  device,  deployed  in  order  to   obtain
    international protection to which PS was not  otherwise  entitled.   It
    was on that basis that the First-tier Tribunal dismissed his appeal. At
    a hearing in 2018 the  Vice  President  Mr  CMG  Ockelton  upheld  that
    finding, but found that the Tribunal had erred in  law  in  failing  to
    assess whether the Appellant would nevertheless be at risk upon  return
    to Iran, simply by virtue of his ostensibly Christian activities in the
    United Kingdom, and his decision  to  rely  upon  those  activities  in
    pursuit of an asylum claim.

 4. The hearing was listed before us in February  2019  in  order  that  we
    could make findings on that aspect of PS's claim. Having  reviewed  the
    material provided by the parties at that  stage,  including  an  expert
    report by Mrs Anna Enayat, we indicated that we would find  it  helpful
    if we could also be addressed on the  current  situation  in  Iran  for
    genuine adherents of Christianity, since we could not  sensibly  assess
    the risk faced by PS without knowing whether he would be at risk if  he
    had actually converted.  It was in this  way  that  the  scope  of  our
    enquiry expanded to include an analysis of the wider country situation.

 5. The guidance on the risk to Christians in Iran  has  remained  constant
    since November 2004 when FS and Others (Iran - Christian Converts) Iran
    CG [2004] UKIAT 00303 was promulgated.   That guidance,  reinforced  by
    the November 2008 decision in SZ and JM  (Christians  -  FS  confirmed)
    Iran CG [2008] UKAIT 00082 is, broadly speaking, as follows:

              i) A distinction must be drawn  between  'ethnic'  Christians,
                 that is to say members of ancient established churches such
                 as the Chaldeans, Assyrians and Armenians in Iran and  more
                 recent  converts   to   Christianity.   Although   'ethnic'
                 Christians do face discrimination and harassment  in  Iran,
                 and claims must be assessed on a case by case  basis,  they
                 do not in general terms face a real risk of  serious  harm;
                 they  are  tolerated,  and  officially  protected  by,  the
                 Iranian constitution  as  Ahl  al-Kitaab  ("people  of  the
                 book").


             ii) Christians perceived by the Iranian state  to  be  actively
                 evangelising or proselytising in the Muslim population are,
                 in general terms, at  risk  of  persecution  regardless  of
                 whether they are  deemed  to  be  leaders  in  the  church.
                 Apostasy from Islam is considered a capital crime  in  Iran
                 and although the death penalty  has  been  sparingly  used,
                 individuals found to be encouraging others to abandon Islam
                 would be reasonably likely to face serious  harm  including
                 arrest, detention and ill-treatment.

            iii) The risk for 'ordinary' Christian converts must be assessed
                 on a case by case basis. There is  in  general  a  risk  of
                 harassment but not of serious  harm.  That  would  only  be
                 reasonably likely to occur where the  individual  had  some
                 additional risk factor beyond the bare fact of  conversion,
                 for instance gender, ethnicity or political profile.    The
                 ordinary convert would  generally  be  able  to  engage  in
                 Christian worship within Iran without facing serious harm.


 6. The case for the Secretary of State before  us  is  that  the  position
    remains unchanged: the ordinary convert to Christianity would  be  able
    to return to Iran without fear of persecution, and  would  be  able  to
    worship without any flagrant restriction on his right to do so.   Since
    PS is not even a genuine Christian, it follows that the risk to him  is
    negligible.


 7. The case for PS is that the situation for Christian  converts  in  Iran
    has markedly deteriorated since  2008,  to  the  extent  that  ordinary
    Christians face  a  real  risk  of  persecution  by  the  state,  which
    consistently portrays them as part of a 'Western' fifth column.   It is
    his case that he will be questioned  upon  return  to  Iran,  and  that
    during the course of such questioning it will come  to  light  that  he
    claimed asylum on the basis that he had converted to Christianity. This
    revelation is reasonably likely to result in  a  transfer  for  further
    interrogation which will in turn expose him to  a  real  risk  of  ill-
    treatment.   It therefore matters not whether or not he  is  a  genuine
    adherent of the Christian faith.

 8. These are the competing arguments that we are asked to address.  Before
    we do so we make two preliminary points.

 9. The first is that no part of this decision is intended to  replace  the
    existing guidance on 'ethnic' Christians:  see  paragraph  5(i)  above.
    Protection claims made by members of these communities must continue to
    be assessed on a case by case  basis.   The  evidence  before  us,  and
    submissions made, were wholly concerned with the position of those  who
    were regarded as Muslims by  the  state,  but  who  themselves  profess
    conversion to Christianity.  All  references  herein  to  'Christians',
    unless otherwise specified, must therefore be read to  mean  'Christian
    converts'.

10. That leads to our second point: what we mean  by  'Christian  convert'.
    It is not possible to make windows into men's  souls.  Whether  someone
    is, or is not, a Christian is a matter of fact that  is  impossible  to
    objectively verify.  For example, an individual  may  pay  very  little
    attention to scripture or sermon but might fervently believe that Jesus
    Christ is the son of God; Christians with a long-held and  deep  belief
    can still face a crisis of faith at any given moment.  It is  no  doubt
    for that reason that the Tribunal in Ali Dorodian v Secretary of  State
    for  the  Home  Department  (01/TH/1537)  preferred  to  focus  on  the
    externally observable: "as we have said, it is church membership rather
    than mere belief, which may lead to risk".  This difficulty means  that
    in  this  jurisdiction  decision  makers  must  rely  largely  on   the
    observations of others to determine whether someone is, or  is  not,  a
    'genuine' Christian.  A further complexity arises. There  is  no  doubt
    for many a path to wholehearted belief, with gradations marked by  life
    events and a deepening understanding. At what point along that path  an
    individual might become a 'Christian' is not clearly signposted.  There
    is certainly no theological consensus on  the  matter;  baptism  is  an
    indicator, but it  should  not  be  regarded  as  determinative.    The
    terminology used in this decision must  therefore  be  read  with  that
    caveat in mind. For our purposes we are primarily concerned with  those
    whom the Iranian state regard as 'Christians'.


    The Evidence


11. The parties very helpfully agreed a core bundle of evidence to which we
    could refer. A complete index of that bundle appears at Annex A of this
    decision. We have read all of the documents that we  have  been  given,
    but only those which we found to be particularly  helpful  or  relevant
    are mentioned herein. These are:

        i) Two November 2017 reports by the Norwegian  Immigration  Service
           information centre 'Landinfo' Iran: Christian converts and house
           churches (1) - prevalence and conditions for religious  practise
           and Christian converts and house  churches  (2)  -  arrests  and
           prosecutions ('the Landinfo reports')


       ii) Three reports  published  by  the  Danish  Immigration  Service,
           either alone or in conjunction with the Danish  Refugee  Council
           and/or Landinfo:  Iran: House Churches  and  Converts  (February
           2018), Update on the Situation for Christian  Converts  in  Iran
           (June 2014),  On  Christian  Conversion  (February  2013)  ('the
           Danish reports')

      iii) Two documents jointly authored by several NGOs. The first is the
           28  March  2019  Joint  Submission  by  Article  18,   Christian
           Solidarity Worldwide and Middle East Concern  to  the  UN  Human
           Rights Council for the Universal Periodic Review (34th session).
           The second is a collaboration between the same organisations, in
           addition  to  Open  Doors  UK,  Violations  of  the  Rights   of
           Christians in Iran in 2018. We intend no disrespect to the other
           organisations involved when we follow the lead of Mrs Enayat  in
           referring to this material as coming from 'Article 18'

       iv) The Respondent's Country  Policy  and  Information  Notes  Iran:
           Christians and Christian Converts published in  May  2019  ('the
           2019 CPIN') and 2015 ('the 2015 CPIN') respectively.


12. We were in addition given expert evidence in the  form  of  a  detailed
    report, and oral evidence, of Mrs  Enayat,  formerly  Senior  Associate
    Member of St Antony's College, Oxford. Mrs Enayat has  been  recognised
    as an expert on Iran in several cases before the Tribunal, including SZ
    and JM, and more recently HB (Kurds) Iran CG [2018] UKUT  00430  (IAC).
     In her report  for  this  appeal  Mrs  Enayat  has  drawn  on  sources
    published in English and Farsi, including the work of other  academics,
    radio and television broadcasts, articles published in  newspapers  and
    online news sites, legal  texts,  research  conducted  by  NGOs,  human
    rights organisations, governments and Christian advocacy groups.    Mrs
    Enayat has been paying close attention to the position of Christians in
    Iran for a number of years, not least because she has twice been called
    upon to write a comprehensive report for  proposed  'country  guidance'
    cases that never came to fruition.   The level of detail in her  report
    is a testament to her research over the years, and we have read it  all
    with care. We have not however considered it necessary to summarise  or
    refer to each aspect of Mrs Enayat's  evidence:  much  of  the  factual
    content was not contested, and where her conclusions are challenged  by
    the Respondent we  have  dealt  with  that  dispute  in  our  findings.
    Whilst we have not  accepted  every  conclusion  that  Mrs  Enayat  has
    reached, we have no hesitation  in  accepting  that  she  is  a  highly
    qualified expert in her field.


    Findings of Fact


13. In this section we discuss and make findings on the evidence  presented
    to us thematically, before we give our concluding 'country guidance'.


    Christianity in Iran


14. All of the sources before us indicate that the conversion of Muslims in
    Iran to Christianity is a growing phenomenon. Disenchantment with Islam
    (or rather  the  socially  conservative  brand  of  Islam  regarded  as
    orthodoxy by the Iranian regime) is identified as one  driving  factor.
    As the state has equated itself with Twelver Shi'ism so  many  Iranians
    have come to associate the negative aspects  of  daily  life  -  socio-
    economic deprivation, political and religious  repression  -with  their
    traditional faith. They conversely associate the allure of the  West  -
    wealth, social and political freedom - with its  traditional  faith  of
    Christianity.  Academics  cited  by  Landinfo  point  out   that   such
    conversions are made more palatable by the fact that there are  aspects
    of Christianity that are theologically compatible  with  Shi'a  belief,
    such as the preoccupation with martyrdom, and the reverence  for  Jesus
    ('Isa). Other studies have identified an emerging  narrative  of  Islam
    being a colonial import, imposed upon Persia by Arab  conquerors.  Then
    there are more cynical motivations.  An elder of  the  Church  of  Iran
    told Landinfo that he believes some Iranians seek baptism only in order
    to facilitate their emigration abroad,  in  particular  to  the  United
    States which for a number  of  years  offered  a  refugee  resettlement
    program for Iranian Christians.


15. That said, there are  still  no  reliable  figures  on  the  number  of
    Christian converts, that is to say  non-ethnic  Christians,  living  in
    Iran today. For obvious reasons there is no prospect  of  their  number
    being confirmed by the Iranian state: as Mrs Enayat puts it, "they  are
    not enumerated because they have no recognised legal person".  We agree
    with Mrs Enayat's assessment -  shared  by  Landinfo  -  that  wherever
    statistics can be found, they must be viewed with  caution.  There  are
    several reasons for that.

16. First, they will likely serve the agenda of whomever is producing them.
    For  instance,  the  huge  numbers  of  converts  claimed  by   various
    evangelical missions must be viewed in light of  the  fact  that  these
    groups look to sister organisations, primarily in the USA, for funding.
    The more converts they can claim, the greater  the  incentive  for  co-
    religionists to donate. This dynamic results in some wildly unrealistic
    figures - for instance we do not regard it as remotely  plausible  that
    there are as many as 1 million people secretly practising  Christianity
    in Iran today, a claim made by Elam Ministries.

17. Second, there appears to be no empirical  method  for  calculating  the
    rate of formal conversion. Evangelical  satellite  television  stations
    may claim millions of viewers, and Christian publishers  may  know  how
    many Farsi bibles they have produced, but watching a  certain  channel,
    or being given a bible, does not make you a Christian.  As  Mrs  Enayat
    explained, those  channels  show  a  variety  of  programmes  including
    cooking shows and content for children: it is perfectly  possible  that
    they have many viewers who have no interest in religion  at  all.    We
    heard some evidence that calculations had been made on the basis of how
    many  people  had  used  certain  online  'chatrooms',  or  called  the
    telephone hotlines of satellite television programmes, but we  are  not
    satisfied that  these  interactions  -  and  the  figures  extrapolated
    therefrom - are in any way reliable indicators of actual conversion.


18. Third, nobody seems to have any idea how many  Christian  converts  (as
    opposed to ethnic Christians) have  left  Iran.  Whilst  it  should  be
    possible to calculate the  number  of  who  have  been  "resettled"  in
    schemes historically offered by countries such as the USA  and  Canada,
    those who have left for neighbouring  countries  such  as  Armenia  and
    Turkey are less easy to quantify.

19. Before us Mrs Enayat was questioned extensively about what she believes
    the true figure to be. She consistently said that she had no idea,  but
    that  an  educated  guess  would  lead  her  to  accept  the  US  State
    Department's "ballpark" figure of 10,000.  For the Secretary  of  State
    Mr Payne accepted that this may be a good starting point for the  lower
    end of the scale, but suggested that the upper end might be as high  as
    50,000.  We are content to proceed on that basis, but for reasons  that
    will become clear, we do not regard the total  figure  of  converts  as
    especially relevant to our assessment of risk.


    The Political Climate


20. In the recent country guidance case of HB (Kurds)  the  Tribunal  found
    [at �26] that the human rights situation in Iran  could  be  "taken  as
    read", so well-documented and uncontested  is  the  evidence  that  the
    record of the regime in that regard is  extremely  poor.   The  parties
    before us were content that we proceed to determine this appeal on  the
    same footing. We need not elaborate save  to  agree  that  the  general
    human rights record of the Islamic Republic continues  to  deteriorate,
    with Amnesty International reporting  over  7000  politically-motivated
    arrests last year.  In the week that  we  heard  this  appeal,  it  was
    widely reported that well over  100  people  had  been  killed  by  the
    security services  in  quelling  protests  against  cuts  to  the  fuel
    subsidies that have traditionally kept many Iranians above the  poverty
    line.


21. As to the political climate as it relates specifically to Christians it
    is Mrs Enayat's analysis that at the time of the  Tribunal's  decisions
    in FS (March 2004) and SZ and JM (November 2008) Iranians were enjoying
    something of a respite from the conservative social policies introduced
    after the revolution.  Under  the  reformist  leadership  of  President
    Khatami (1997-2005) Christians - even converts - were generally able to
    express their faith through collective  worship.  Although  there  were
    some arrests and prosecutions, these were relatively small  in  number.
    Mrs Enayat postulates that towards the end of Khatami's government this
    period of relative laissez faire came to an end. Conservative  elements
    gained  in  strength,  culminating  in  the   election   of   President
    Ahmadinejad  in  2005.  This  ushered  in  an  era  of  return  to  the
    fundamentalist policies pursued immediately post-1979.  The  notion  of
    loyalty to the state became increasingly enmeshed with Shi'a  identity,
    so that other groups - Zoroastrians, Baha'ai, Sufis, Christians  etc  -
    began to be portrayed as enemies of the state. This became particularly
    pronounced after the  2009  elections,  peaking  in  2011.  It  is  Mrs
    Enayat's belief that this trend continues today, with hardliners within
    the  regime  pursuing  a  narrative  of  Christianity  in  Iran   being
    associated with western - or more specifically 'Zionist' - interests.


22. All of the other material before us supports Mrs Enayat's  thesis  that
    the Iranian regime has come  to  identify  Christian  activity  in  the
    country with western, or Israeli/'Zionist', influence.  The 2018 Danish
    report pinpoints the disputed  2009  election  as  the  turning  point:
    "there has been a change in the way the  Iranian  authorities  look  at
    Christians in general. The change started after the green revolution in
    2009, as the Christians are  perceived  to  bring  ideas  of  freedom".
    Landinfo concurs, and suggest that the suspicions of the Iranian  state
    are in fact well-founded, pointing to the close connection between many
    groups in Iran and western-based Ministries such  as  Open  Doors  USA,
    Elam (whose headquarters are in Sussex) and the Pars Theological Centre
    in London.  Landinfo cite academic research to the  effect  that  house
    churches are dependent upon support from abroad,  and  quote  a  source
    saying that they would not exist without it.     This  is  one  of  the
    reasons why the state rarely prosecutes converts on  religious  grounds
    (i.e.  apostasy):  "organised  Christian  activity  and  contact   with
    Christian organisations abroad is instead defined as political activity
    and as a threat against the country's  Islamic  identity  and  national
    security...consequently, it is the intelligence services that  monitor,
    arrest and interrogate converts, and prosecutions are held  before  the
    Revolutionary Court".  Landinfo continue:


         "The reason why Iranian  authorities  define  the  organised  house
         church movement to be a threat against national security,  is  that
         they relate  the  movement's  activities  to  political  opposition
         activities. House church meetings are conducted  in  secret,  which
         means that the government can neither control who participates  nor
         what happens in the meetings. The government therefore consider the
         meetings to be a potential source of opposition activity  that  can
         threaten the regime. Furthermore, there  is  contact  between  many
         house churches  and  foreign  communities.  This  kind  of  Western
         connection is perceived by the authorities as  suspect,  and  as  a
         threat to the regime.


         Iranian  authorities  consider  Christian   missionary   work   and
         proliferation of Western and secular values within the  country  to
         be an attempt from Western countries, including Israel, to  destroy
         Islam and Iranian culture and undermine its Islamic rule of law...A
         number  of  government  officials  have   defined   the   form   of
         Christianity practised in the house church movement  as  a  deviant
         and false form of Christianity and house churches as corrupt  sects
         (ICHRI 2013a,  p.  24-26).  A  representative  of  Elam  Ministries
         pointed out in a lecture about Christian converts (Malta, May 2017)
         that Iran is a theocracy where apostasy from Islam is  not  only  a
         religious issue, but also a political one. Apostates  (Muslims  who
         leave Islam) are seen as a threat to the regime, and Christians who
         conduct missions aimed at Muslims are considered possible spies for
         the West and Israel".

23. The May 2019 CPIN cites further opinion from the United  States'  State
    Department and others to  the  effect  that  the  Iranian  state  views
    Christian house churches as "Zionist propaganda institutions".


24. Given the unanimity in the sources we accept  that  the  Iranian  state
    tends today to associate Christian activity with political  opposition,
    and in particular political opposition fuelled by the 'West', or by the
    United States, United Kingdom and Israel  in  particular.   We  further
    accept that this  trend  has  become  markedly  more  pronounced  since
    approximately 2008/2009,  and  that  this  has  been  a  feature  of  a
    worsening political climate for Christians -  and  minority  faiths  in
    general - in Iran.

25. It is against that general political landscape  that  we  consider  the
    evidence on the law as it is used against Christians in Iran today.


    Conversion as a crime

26. As a matter of Iranian law an individual who turns away  from  Islam  -
    to another faith or simply  atheism  -   has  committed  the  crime  of
    ertedad, or apostasy. It is a crime which can draw, and has drawn,  the
    ultimate punishment of execution.  Mrs Enayat and Landinfo both explain
    that although this is not a crime to be found in the penal code  it  is
    regarded as law because paragraph 167 of  the  Constitution  stipulates
    that in cases where an issue is not covered by the  codified  law,  the
    judge shall apply traditional Islamic  law.  In  his  work  Tahrir  Al-
    Vasileh Ayatollah Khomeini prescribed the death penalty for apostasy in
    his legal deliberations, and his opinion is regarded as a source of law
    in Iran.


27. That authoritative source of law notwithstanding, it does not appear to
    be a charge that has been used with great  frequency.  Landinfo  accept
    the evidence of the International Campaign for  Human  Rights  in  Iran
    that there have been only three recorded instances of  convictions  for
    ertedad since 1979: Hossein Soodmand who  was  executed  in  prison  in
    1990, Mehdi Dibaj who was killed after his release in 1994, and  Yousef
    Naderkhani whose death sentence was eventually converted to  a  lengthy
    prison sentence in 2012.

28. Mrs Enayat postulates that there may be three reasons for the very  low
    rate of apostasy convictions.  First  because  the  Iranian  regime  is
    conscious of the international outcry that will inevitably ensue should
    a sentence for apostasy be handed down by  the  courts.  Second  it  is
    unnecessary: there are plenty of other legal avenues by which Christian
    converts can be prosecuted. Third, because at least in the period up to
    2005 the campaign against conversion was led extra-judicially by agents
    of the Ministry of Intelligence who  used  intimidation  and  detention
    without charge as a means of breaking up house churches.

29. Whilst Mrs Enayat agrees that formal convictions  have  been  extremely
    rare, she stresses in her report that these three  cases  are  not  the
    complete picture. Apostasy charges have also been used  retrospectively
    to justify extra-judicial execution,  and  prospectively  as  means  to
    intimidate detainees:


         "In fact, apostasy charges have been used  in  a  wide  variety  of
         contexts since 1979 including leftist prisoners executed for  their
         atheism in the 1988 prison massacres and non-conformist Muslims  as
         well as converts to Christianity in the early 1990s.  Between  2008
         and 2011 there was  a  marked  increase  in  the  number  of  legal
         proceedings   for   apostasy   conducted   against   converts    to
         Christianity..."

30. Other sources also stress that the notion of ertedad does  remain  very
    relevant for converts to Christianity in that it hangs over  them,  and
    will often be used as a threat during  interrogations.   Landinfo  cite
    research documenting several cases where the  charge  is  mentioned  at
    preliminary  court  hearings,  only  to  disappear   from   the   final
    indictment. It can therefore be used as a means of putting pressure  on
    the detainee. Mrs Enayat adds:

         "Iranians of a Muslim background who convert to Christianity or any
         other religion are viewed as apostates (mortad)  and  as  such  are
         subject to harsh treatment while in the custody of the authorities.
         If a conversion to Christianity is known of,  any  brush  with  the
         authorities (whether Revolutionary Guard, Basij,  ordinary  police,
         security authorities,  judiciary),  for  whatever  reason  (even  a
         motoring  offence),  will  put  them   at   risk   of   harsh   and
         discriminatory treatment".

31. In respect  of  the  alternative  charges  that  can  be  used  against
    Christians Mrs Enayat highlights Article 513 of book  5  of  the  Penal
    Code. This reads:


         "Anyone who insults the holy  precepts  of  Islam  or  one  of  the
         prophets or imams or the Prophet Mohammad will be executed  if  the
         insult can be considered a  sabb  al-Nabi  [sacrilege/  blasphemy];
         otherwise  they  will  be  sentenced  to  a  term  of   1-5   years
         imprisonment."


32. It will be noted that what might constitute  an  "insult  to  religion"
    remains undefined. Mrs Enayat states that it is for  this  reason  that
    this Article has been  used  to  prosecute  a  wide  variety  of  acts,
    religious and otherwise. A recent example is that of Amin Afshar-Naderi
    who in early July 2017 was sentenced alongside four others  of  "acting
    against national security by organising and conducting house-churches".
    Each of the accused received a 10-year sentence. Mr  Afshar-Naderi  was
    however given an additional five years under Article 513 for "insulting
    the sacred" for a comical  Facebook  post  he  shared  that  adopted  a
    Quranic writing style about the sharp rise in the price of  chicken  in
    Iran.


33. Other examples of prosecutions under Article 513  illustrate  its  wide
    remit, and how it is  used  to  effectively  stifle  dissent.  In  2000
    newspaper publisher Latif Safari got 30 months because of two  articles
    criticising capital  punishment.  In  2002  academic  Professor  Hashem
    Aghajari was sentenced to death (later commuted to five years in prison
    after widespread protest) for giving a lecture in which he advocated  a
    reformist interpretation of  Islam.   In  2012  human  rights  activist
    Yousef Pourseifi received a two-year sentence for  'blasphemy'  because
    he posted an article about sigheh (temporary marriage) and  the  status
    of women, and  in  2010  Said  Malekpour  an  Iranian-Canadian  website
    designer was sentenced to death for  various  charges  including  those
    brought under Article 513. Mr Malekpour's crime was alleged to  be  the
    development  of  photosharing  tools  that  were  utilised  by   online
    pornographers.


34. An alternative route to prosecution is Article 498 of  book  5  of  the
    Penal Code. This Article prescribes prison sentences of between  2  and
    10 years for anyone who establishes or leads an organisation  or  group
    whose purpose is to "interfere with or damage Iran's security", and  so
    it is, Landinfo believe, often used  against  those  accused  of  being
    house church 'leaders'.  Mrs Enayat writes that the  increased  use  of
    this provision has emerged in tandem with government propaganda efforts
    to portray converts to Christianity as political activists  functioning
    as agents of the West. In the evidence we have on  prosecutions  it  is
    this, and other 'anti-organisation' provisions, which  feature  heavily
    in the reports.

35. Having had regard to  the  evidence  we  are  satisfied  that  apostasy
    (ertedad)  charges  are  very  rarely   pursued   through   to   actual
    prosecution. In the  vast  majority  of  cases  where  individuals  are
    brought to court it is to face alternative, lesser, charges.   Apostasy
    -  a  capital  offence  -  nevertheless  remains  a  potent  tool   for
    interrogation, a threat that is frequently used  against  detainees  in
    the course of questioning.


    Restriction and Control


36. For a period after the revolution, until around  2005-2006,  Christians
    were permitted to openly worship at established churches. This  applied
    not only to the 'ethnic'  Christians  such  as  the  Armenians  but  to
    Persian-speaking Iranians who had converted  as  a  result  of  Western
    missionary activities before the establishment of the Islamic  Republic
    in 1979, their  descendants  and  a  relatively  small  number  of  new
    converts.  Thus, at the time of FS [2004], the Tribunal  was  primarily
    concerned with the state's intimidation of churchgoers,  and  the  fact
    that it permitted no new churches to be built.    There  were  periodic
    crackdowns and church closures, but it is Mrs  Enayat's  evidence  that
    this space to freely worship   has become  increasingly  confined.  She
    writes that since 2003 the Iranian government has  actively  pursued  a
    strategy of restricting  Christian  assembly  through  the  closure  of
    official  church  premises,  a  policy  that  climaxed  in  the   years
    immediately  following  SZ  &  JM  [2008].  Of  these  Persian-speaking
    Protestant churches she writes:

         "Between March 2009 and December 2014 all  were  either  completely
         closed  down  or  isolated  by  putting  them  under   the   direct
         supervision   of   a   member   of   the   security    forces...The
         priesthood/leadership of  all  these  churches  was  simultaneously
         systematically persecuted (through arrests,  threats  or  continual
         harassment), forbidden contact  with  their  congregation,  and  in
         several cases forced into exile (i.e.  explicitly  confronted  with
         the option of exile, imprisonment and/or serial harassment)"


37. Article 18 agree with this analysis, and highlight a ban of the use  of
    Farsi in Christian services as the  mechanism  by  which  the  security
    services were able to enforce the policy. Landinfo report  that  it  is
    not possible to say with certainty how many Persian-language protestant
    churches are still officially operating in Iran,  but  they  have  been
    informed by Elam Ministries that it is only three: one in  Shiraz,  one
    in Tehran and one in Isfahan. Elam state that it  is  well  known  that
    these are under close scrutiny of the Ministry of Intelligence  (MOIS);
    this involves agents in attendance during services, CCTV monitoring and
    official access to church records.   These churches are only  permitted
    to continue so that the authorities can claim  there  to  be  religious
    freedom in Iran.   Because  of  the  high  level  of  surveillance  and
    control, Persian speaking converts would find it extremely difficult to
    join one of these churches: their pastors, and congregation,  are  well
    aware that to permit new converts to join them would mean  a  risk,  at
    the very least, of the church being closed down entirely.


38. In light of the consistency in the sources we accept and find that  the
    Iranian authorities have, over the past decade, effectively  restricted
    Christian  converts  from  engaging  in  open  collective  worship,  by
    pursuing a policy of church closures.


39. The result of the church closures, explain Landinfo, is that  Christian
    worship is now conducted almost exclusively in private. That is done in
    one of two ways.

40. The first is that it remains open to individuals  to  access  Christian
    content through satellite television stations,  websites,  WhatsApp  or
    other social media.  For these individuals, who choose not  to  join  a
    house church, their interest, or faith, is  a  solitary  affair.    The
    sources we were referred to all acknowledge that there may  be  a  good
    number of these people, but there is no  reliable  method  of  counting
    their number.  Mrs Enayat agreed that the  prospect  of  such  converts
    encountering difficulties with the Iranian state would be minimal. They
    will routinely use VPNs to obscure their  IP  address  when  using  the
    internet and will be extremely cautious about  discussing  their  faith
    outside  their  homes  or  on  the  telephone.  Although  the   Iranian
    government have attempted to disrupt the use of such technologies - for
    instance by banning the popular encrypted messaging service  'Telegram'
    in 2018 - this has been  with  limited  success.  The  chance  of  such
    isolated 'hidden believers' coming to the  attention  of  the  security
    services through online surveillance is therefore small. The risk  from
    viewing evangelical television channels is similarly low: from  outside
    the home it is impossible to tell what programmes  have  been  watched,
    and the 'box' inside the home  would  only  reveal  the  last  hour  of
    content.  Mrs Enayat thought it likely that anyone watching a Christian
    broadcast would be sure to 'wipe' his  or  her  box  immediately  after
    viewing.   To  the  extent  that  this  private   interaction   through
    technology could be considered to be  Christian  worship,  the  sources
    agreed that these converts are by  and  large  able  to  engage  in  it
    without any difficulty.


41. We should add  that  detection  of  these  'hidden  believers'  is  not
    impossible. As the Danish report acknowledges,  Amnesty  International,
    Middle East Concern and others have pointed out that a conversion might
    be revealed by default. If the convert does not participate in the many
    normal social and cultural activities associated with Islam he  or  she
    may draw the unwanted attention of  neighbours,  family  or  the  wider
    community, who may in turn inform the authorities of their  suspicions.
     They are compelled, by social convention and expectation, to act in  a
    certain way. As Middle East Concern told Danish researchers:

         "it does not make sense to talk of the concept 'silent Christians'.
         People who are Christians are forced to educate their children in a
         Muslim way, and to change or lie about  their  religious  identity.
         You cannot just be low-profiled but would have to act against  your
         faith in so many ways; you would have to lie  about  your  religion
         e.g. on job-applications, school-registration etc.  where  you  are
         always asked about your faith  and  religion.  You  would  have  to
         celebrate Eid and other Muslim traditions, like going to the Mosque
         at burials. Otherwise it would be very odd. Islam is  a  community-
         religion integrated into the Iranian culture, so even if the  major
         part of the Iranian population is not very religious, many  customs
         and traditions in the country are Muslim. It would  be  noticed  if
         you do not participate, and you would easily be stigmatized. If you
         die a Christian, you would not be able to get a Christian burial".

42. We accept that this is no doubt so. It  has  long  been  accepted  that
    Christians face entrenched discrimination in Iran in matters  of  their
    personal status, and that such discrimination operates to deny them the
    opportunity to express their faith  in  all  aspects  of  their  public
    lives.  This discrimination is to be  abhorred  but  we  remain  to  be
    satisfied that it interferes with the core  right  of  this  particular
    group of Christians to practise their faith in a manner  acceptable  to
    them. We were shown little  evidence,  for  instance,  of  the  Iranian
    authorities raiding the homes of such individuals. As we shall see, the
    evidence on arrests and prosecution overwhelmingly relates  to  persons
    who are part of a group. That leads us to consider  the  measures  that
    the state has taken  against  the  second  means  of  worship  open  to
    Christians in Iran today: the house churches.

43. House churches have existed as a phenomenon in  Iran  since  the  early
    2000s.  Landinfo  explain  that  these  small   private   congregations
    initially consisted of  ethnic  Iranians  who  had  been  converted  by
    friends or relatives, or by an evangelist message brought directly into
    their  homes  by  satellite  television  or  the  internet.    As   the
    Protestant denominations such as  the  Assembly  of  God  faced  church
    closure and restriction, their members were forced underground to  join
    those already worshipping in private homes.  In her written report  Mrs
    Enayat gives a detailed survey of this process, but  for  our  purposes
    she and Landinfo are in agreement that the different waves of converts,
    and different denominations of Farsi-speaking Christians, are  now  all
    compelled to worship in the  same  covert  manner.   Because  they  are
    clandestine organisations it has never been possible to  say  how  many
    house churches are operating at any one time in Iran.

44. Mrs Enayat believes that the average house church has a  membership  of
    between 5 and 12; they operate as a secret, cell-like  structure,  with
    members often deliberately ignorant of the composition of other groups.
     They consider themselves to  be  under  constant  threat  of  closure,
    disruption and arrest.  Members will vary venues, and turn  off  mobile
    telephones, when they set off for a meeting, so as to avoid  detection.
    Seeking to keep 'under the radar' congregations will break up  if  they
    become too large or have met too often.  An  informant  to  the  Danish
    report stated that it is rare for any one group to  remain  intact  for
    more than two years.  There are fears of infiltration by  the  Ministry
    of Intelligence and so precautions would be taken  before  new  members
    are admitted. There was  evidence  before  us  to  indicate  that  such
    subjective fears are objectively well-founded.

45. Infiltration and undercover intelligence gathering are reported  to  be
    widespread. A number of organisations including Article 18, the  Danish
    Immigration Service and ICHRI confirm that as part of the state's 'open
    monitoring', pastors of house churches and the recognised churches have
    told them of  being  approached  by  officials  from  the  Ministry  of
    Intelligence  who  demand  that  they  share  information  about  their
    congregations.  This runs in tandem with 'covert monitoring', where the
    security services make extensive use of informers to  infiltrate  house
    church congregations as ordinary members for the  specific  purpose  of
    reporting back on those present.  These may be people who  are  already
    members of the congregation who are picked up and  pressured,  or  they
    may be spies deliberately planted. Family  members  who  work  for  the
    state are encouraged to inform upon family members  who  are  attending
    house church, and their social status would be affected by  failure  to
    do so.  Neighbours who see  unusual  activity  around  a  property  are
    another source of information.

46. Article 18 identify five means by which  the  convert  community,  even
    those who keep a low profile, are scrutinised by the security services.
    Firstly, the authorities keep close watch on the families or associates
    of those already known to have converted. Following an  arrest,  family
    members are often summoned to security offices  for  interrogation  and
    are at risk of arrest themselves.  Secondly, the  security  forces  are
    known to target places where Christian converts meet for worship.  Such
    raids have become routine and physical abuse is commonplace.   Thirdly,
    the security forces are  known  to  monitor  correspondence,  telephone
    communication and internet activity  to  identify  converts  and  those
    assisting them. Fourthly, the security forces routinely seek to extract
    information  from  known  converts   about   other   converts.   During
    interrogation, detainees  are  put  under  pressure  to  name  all  the
    Christian converts they know. Fifthly, converts are sometimes  detected
    during routine searches in which incriminating documents  or  materials
    are uncovered.

47. In 2013 the International Campaign for Human  Rights  in  Iran  (ICHRI)
    interviewed  a  number  of  Christians  who  had  been  released   from
    detention. Mrs Enayat writes that in the course of these interviews  it
    became clear to  the  researchers  that  the  security  services  "knew
    information about the detainees which can only have been  gleaned  from
    wire-taps, street surveillance or monitoring online  activity".  It  is
    believed that there is widespread monitoring of telecommunications  and
    electronic communication. A source to the  Danish  report  stated  that
    certain phrases - "church", "Jesus", "Christian" and "baptism" -  serve
    as keywords to  trigger  phone  tapping.    Whilst  the  Danish  report
    questions the extent of  the  surveillance  operation  by  the  Iranian
    security services it also acknowledges that whatever its reach  it  has
    an obvious chilling effect on the way that people behave:

         "It is unknown to what extent  the  Iranian  authorities  have  the
         capacity to monitor  everybody.  The  authorities  do  not  monitor
         everyone all the time; what the authorities want  is  to  create  a
         fear among people that they are being monitored  all  the  time,  a
         source highlighted"

48. Given all of that, it is perhaps unsurprising to find reference in  the
    evidence to Christians finding it difficult to locate and join a  house
    church. Mrs Enayat for instance cites  a  Turkish  newspaper  interview
    with a convert identified as 'Amiri' who said that he had converted  in
    2000 after watching satellite television programmes and then spent  the
    next nine  years  trying  to  join  a  house  church  in  the  "closed"
    atmosphere of Isfahan and Tehran. The  evangelising  mission  of  these
    groups - and the evidence that rates of  conversion  are  increasing  -
    must be read in  this  context:  where  house  church  members  recruit
    friends or family members,  they  do  so  at  great  personal  risk  of
    discovery.


49. Once an operational house church has been identified, there is  a  risk
    of raid and closure: that this is so is apparent from the incidence  of
    reported arrests that are made at 'private  gatherings'  (to  which  we
    return below).  The parties agree that  the  rate  of  such  raids  has
    fluctuated over the past ten years.  There were for  instance  a  great
    number of house churches broken up by  the  authorities  between  2008-
    2012, particularly between March 2010 and March 2011; there was another
    spike of activity in the summer of 2016 and  again  in  December  2018.
    Why that should be so is hard to know.  One unidentified source  in  an
    unidentified 'Western embassy' told the  Danish  researchers  that  the
    regime gave the house churches "space to operate".   Whilst we  do  not
    doubt that there are house churches subsisting 'under  the  radar'  the
    notion that they do so with the acquiescence of the  security  services
    would appear to be at odds with the overt hostility of the  regime  (as
    articulated in speeches etc), the record of actual raids  and  arrests,
    and the law.    Another explanation for why house churches continue  to
    survive is that the Iranian state simply lacks the resources  to  close
    them all down at once.   We  accept  that  the  security  services  are
    likely to concentrate on those house churches that are perceived to  be
    growing, or those connected with known leaders, whilst  keeping  groups
    of less  immediate  interest  under  pressure,  and  observation.  That
    interpretation is consonant with the view expressed by Mrs Enayat, that
    the periods of quiet can be attributed to the success of the operations
    that preceded them.


50. When a raid does take place, Mrs Enayat writes that the authorities may
    simply arrest the perceived leaders - the pastor, the organiser of  the
    meeting and perhaps the occupier of the  house  offered  for  meetings.
    Alternatively, they may arrest  everybody  present  at  the  gathering,
    which is after all, illegal.

51. Some of those arrested are held for weeks or months at  a  time  before
    being bailed to appear in court  at  a  later  date.  We  consider  the
    evidence relating to  this  group  below,  but  here  we  consider  the
    evidence about the wider practice of what might be  termed  'disruptive
    detention'.  The sources before us all indicate that  the  majority  of
    arrests follow this pattern: a Christian convert is apprehended  either
    at, or on their way to or from, a meeting.  The individual is taken  to
    the  police  station  and  questioned.    They   are   threatened   and
    intimidated, then told that they must sign an undertaking  before  they
    can be released. The 2019 CPIN suggests that these undertakings consist
    of a promise to desist from proselytizing but Mrs Enayat is of the view
    that they are typically much wider in scope: "every account I have seen
    of these undertakings requires that  they  stay  away  from  'Christian
    activity' including, explicitly, Christian gatherings".   Her  view  is
    supported by Landinfo and the findings  of  the  Danish  report,  which
    describe  the  demand  to  stop  all  Christian   activity,   including
    attendance at house church, as "standard procedure". One  source  cited
    in the Danish report said this:

         "With regard to the statements drawn up  by  the  authorities  that
         converts are forced to sign, an Iranian leader  of  a  home  church
         network explained that based on his own experience  and  knowledge,
         these statements typically contain admittances of cooperation  with
         'sinful' foreign organizations as well as statements to the  effect
         that all Christians are spies. When an individual signs, he or  she
         agrees not to be in communication  with  foreign  organizations  as
         well as refrain from  receiving  financial  support  from  'sinful'
         organizations. It may also contain statements to the effect that  a
         person will no longer attend seminars in Turkey or outside of  Iran
         and that a person will return to Islam. If a person does not  agree
         to these terms, they  may  face  imprisonment.  The  crime  applied
         generally, is one related to working against the  security  of  the
         country. However, generally, in pre-trial detention,  there  is  no
         charge, however accusations are thrown about right  and  left  with
         the aim  of  obtaining  more  information  on  house  churches  and
         creating fear".

52. Mrs Enayat opines that refusal to sign such an undertaking  would  give
    rise to a risk of ill-treatment and much longer detention. One  example
    she gives is that of the Behrooz family:


         "Maria, Stephen, and Ehsan Behrooz, three of a group of 15 converts
         arrested while travelling to a  Christian  meeting  in  Bojnurd  nr
         Mashhad on 28 July 2010 were detained for more  than  three  months
         having refused to give  in  to  demands  that  they  recant.  Legal
         proceedings were initiated and apostasy charges  threatened.  Ehsan
         Behrouz was released on bail amounting to  $80,000  dollars  on  10
         October. A year later he was re-arrested on  7  November  2011  for
         unknown  reasons  (he  had  reportedly  been  keeping  a  very  low
         profile), held incommunicado in solitary confinement for 105  days,
         and again released without trial"


53. Given that the  purpose  of  such  pressure  is  to  disrupt  organised
    Christian activity it  is  in  our  view  hardly  surprising  that  the
    security services will refuse to take no for an answer. Otherwise it is
    difficult to see what the point of the arrest would have been.  We  are
    satisfied, and  we  did  not  understand  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    disagree, that refusal to sign such an undertaking would give rise to a
    real risk of  prolonged  detention  and  the  attendant  risk  of  ill-
    treatment.


54. Conversely, where the individual  does  make  such  a  confession,  the
    evidence indicates that he or  she  will  normally  be  released  quite
    quickly. Mrs Enayat believes that most  such  detentions  last  between
    anything from a few hours to a week: she  thinks  it  common  that  the
    period would be something less than 24 hours.    If he or she abides by
    the promises made, i.e. returning to  Islam  and  abandoning  Christian
    practice, it may be that no further difficulties will  follow.   Whilst
    Mrs Enayat agrees that this is  common  pattern  she,  and  the  Danish
    report, caution that this is not the rule: there have been cases  where
    the subject has been quickly released but is subsequently brought  back
    to court and sentenced under  one  of  the  many  provisions  routinely
    deployed against Christian converts.

55. Having had regard to the consistent evidence before us we are satisfied
    that the 'undertakings' that Christian detainees are required  to  sign
    in order to secure their release will typically consist of a confession
    to having  participated  in  Christian  activities,  membership  of  an
    illegal organisation and a promise to return to Islam; there appears to
    be  frequent  mention  of  complicity  with  'Western'   or   'Zionist'
    interests. If the document is signed, the individual will  normally  be
    released within 24 hours, although there  is  a  possibility  of  being
    summonsed back to court for sentencing  at  a  later  date.   Mr  Payne
    accepted that where such an  undertaking  had  been  signed,  it  would
    certainly amount to an "aggravating factor" should  the  individual  be
    arrested again.  We agree. Given the consequences  that  we  know  will
    follow a refusal to sign, it  must  logically  be  the  case  that  the
    authorities would take an equally dim view of those who fail to  comply
    with an undertaking once made. We are satisfied that it  is  reasonably
    likely to lead to a far longer detention, ill-treatment  and  potential
    prosecution.


56. We note that there is one further method employed by the authorities to
    restrict and control the behaviour of Christian converts.  The  sources
    all  make  reference  to   the   risk   of   "ordinary   house   church
    members...being called in for interrogation on a regular basis  as  the
    authorities want to  harass  and  intimidate  them"  (the  2018  Danish
    report).  The use of the word 'regular' does not give  us  much  of  an
    idea as to how frequently this tactic is used.   Mrs  Enayat  explained
    that she  expressly  excluded  such  interrogation  sessions  from  her
    statistics on arrests because these incidents, which may  only  last  a
    couple of hours, very  often  go  unreported.   They  may  involve  the
    signing, or enforcement, of an undertaking.

57. Finally, we acknowledge the suggestion  by  numerous  sources  for  the
    Landinfo report  (Christians  in  Parliament,  the  Danish  Immigration
    Service, Article 18, an academic, church leaders) that  the  tactic  of
    letting Christian suspects go  after  such  intimidatory  detention  or
    questioning is a  deliberate  ploy  to  get  rid  of  them:  Christians
    reported being told by interrogators - and in  one  case  a  judge  who
    granted bail - that they were being released so that they  could  leave
    the country.

    Arrests, detention & prosecution


58. The parties are in agreement that Christians in Iran can  face  arrest,
    prosecution and imprisonment for reasons of their religious belief.  As
    to who those Christians might be, in what circumstances they would risk
    arrest, and the consequences thereof,  there  is  significant  dispute.
    Before we set out our assessment of the evidence, it is important  that
    we make some preliminary observations.


59. First, we note that there is a discernible circularity in the reporting
    of such matters. A specific  raid  by  the  security  services  may  be
    reported by five different agencies but that does not  mean  that  each
    report constitutes independent evidence of it having occurred. Many  of
    the experts, academics, government agencies and NGOs reporting on  Iran
    do so from the disadvantage that they cannot,  or  will  not,  actually
    enter  the  country.  Thus,  they  come  to  rely  on  each  other  for
    information. With that in mind we have given greater  weight  to  those
    reports which give significant levels of detail, and have borne in mind
    the danger of double-counting  in  our  evaluation  of  global  figures
    presented in the sources.

60. Second, we accept that it is  likely  that  the  individuals  named  as
    having been arrested in the various reports before us are not the  only
    Christians subject to arrest in Iran.   It is clear that many,  if  not
    all, investigations into individuals are conducted under the pretext of
    some vaguely worded provision (such as  Article  513)  or  politically-
    themed charges.  Any religious motivation for the arrests  can  thereby
    be masked. Further we know that many Christians in Iran are worshipping
    in private, or in very small informal circles. If these individuals are
    arrested or otherwise harassed it is plausible that this will not  come
    to the attention of the wider  Christian  community,  or  human  rights
    organisations. We further note the point made by a Pastor  to  Landinfo
    researchers: often detainees are threatened and told by the authorities
    to keep their arrest quiet. People are afraid for themselves, and their
    families.  There are therefore arrests which are  deliberately  omitted
    from the statistics.  Mrs Enayat stressed that there is  very  often  a
    distinct time lag between events occurring on the ground  and  actually
    being reported. This can be because the  victim  of  persecution  waits
    until they are safely out of Iran before they tell  anyone,  or  simply
    because the incident has not yet come to the attention of the reporting
    agencies.  Although  this  historical  problem  may   be   increasingly
    mitigated by the use of the internet within Iran, we were asked to view
    what information we have for the recent past with some caution, bearing
    in mind Mrs Enayat's view that it is very  likely  that  news  of  some
    incidents is yet to emerge.

61. Third, many of the sources use different time frames, and conflate  the
    terminology, so that it is  very  difficult  for  a  clear  picture  to
    emerge. For instance, the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iran
    has stated that between June 2010 and  September  2012  there  were  at
    least 300 arrests; it is impossible to know how many of  these  can  be
    carried over into the statistics produced by American  Christian  group
    USCIRF when they  say  that  "as  of"  December  2013  there  were  158
    Christians "imprisoned, arrested  or  were  awaiting  trial".  We  came
    across reports of trials and convictions where the original arrest does
    not appear to have been reported at all:  Landinfo make the point  that
    legal terms such as arrest, imprisonment,  indictment,  accusation  and
    prosecution are not always used consistently by  the  various  sources,
    nor will they always be accurately translated from the Farsi.

62. This leads to a further issue. Under cross examination by Mr Payne, Mrs
    Enayat  acknowledged  that  she  herself   had   adopted   inconsistent
    methodologies in her various reports over the  years.  In  the  opening
    remarks of her report she seeks to contrast the  number  of  Christians
    arrested in the four years immediately preceding the appeal in SZ & JM,
    a figure she gives as 65, with the number arrested in  the  four  years
    immediately following that decision, which she calculated  to  be  505.
    In reaching the earlier, smaller figure she had  deliberately  excluded
    any period of questioning or detention of less than 24  hours;  in  the
    latter, larger figure arrests leading to detention of less than  a  day
    had been included, and in fact amounted to about half of that total.

63. Finally, we note that  there  is  some  danger  of  the  figures  being
    inflated by the practice of the Iranian security services of subjecting
    targets to multiple arrests.  Often an  individual  will  be  arrested,
    detained, released on bail, only to be arrested some time later  before
    being brought to  trial.  Other  committed  Christians  appear  in  the
    literature having been repeatedly arrested  and  imprisoned  over  many
    years.  Whilst this increases the overall number of incidents, it  does
    not increase the overall number of Christians suffering persecution.

64. With those observations in mind, we address the evidence before us.  We
    summarise the evidence  in  respect  of  the  period  2008-2015  before
    looking in greater depth at events over the past five years.   We  have
    sought to look not simply at the headline figures  of  those  arrested,
    but to examine in greater detail the surrounding circumstances of those
    arrests, whether prosecutions have ensued, and how long detentions have
    lasted for.

65. We begin by recording the agreement between the parties that there  was
    a discernible spike in the number of arrests in  2008-2012,  the  years
    covering the 'green movement'  uprising  and  its  aftermath.  Of  this
    period Mrs Enayat considers  it  clear  that  the  Iranian  regime  was
    pursuing a "policy of destroying  the  fabric  of  organized  religious
    activity among Persian speaking converts  from  Islam".   The  wave  of
    arrests peaked in the Iranian year 1390 (March 2010-March 11)  with  at
    least 232 arrests  reported  in  that  period.  This  campaign  ran  in
    parallel to the state's systematic closure of the established  churches
    (see above) and the targeted dismantling of the  house  church  network
    that tried to take their place.  As to  how  dramatic  the  spike  was,
    there is some  dispute  between  the  parties:  we  mention  above  Mrs
    Enayat's failure to use  a  consistent  methodology  in  compiling  her
    figures.  Even so, there was a clear  rise  in  arrests.  Mrs  Enayat's
    total for the years 2008-2012 is 505; she estimates that half of  those
    were short term (i.e. approximately 24 hours long). Even if we  exclude
    these, that is still a marked increase in the use of arrest as a  means
    of repression.

66. In 2013 the reformist government of President Rouhani  came  to  power.
    Although Mrs Enayat agrees that the Christian  community  then  enjoyed
    some respite from the high degree of scrutiny  that  it  had  attracted
    under Ahmadinejad, she believes that in fact the underlying policy  did
    not change. There  may  have  been  a  decrease  in  arrests,  but  she
    interprets this as simply a fluctuation, reflecting the fact  that  the
    earlier campaign of church closures had been so successful.    We  were
    referred to the conclusions of the UN Special Rapporteur in respect  of
    2013-14 (quoted in a CPIN in December 2014):

         "At least 49 Christians  were  reportedly  being  detained  in  the
         Islamic Republic of Iran as at January 2014.  In  2013  alone,  the
         authorities reportedly arrested at least 42 Christians, of whom  35
         were convicted for  participation  in  informal  "house  churches",
         association with churches outside the  Islamic  Republic  of  Iran,
         perceived or real evangelical activity and other standard Christian
         activities. Sentences range from 1 to 10 years of imprisonment. The
         Christians most commonly prosecuted  appear  to  be  converts  from
         Muslim backgrounds or those that proselytize or minister to Iranian
         Muslims. Iranian authorities at the highest levels have  designated
         house churches and evangelical Christians as  threats  to  national
         security".

67. The next report of the Special Rapporteur (2 March 2015) found that the
    total of reported detentions - of longer than 24 hours -  in  2014  had
    been 69. As of 1 January 2015,  at  least  92  Christians  remained  in
    detention.

68. For the year 2016 Mrs Enayat was content to accept the analysis offered
    at 8.2.14 of the 2019 CPIN:

         "Christian  World  Watch  Monitor  reported  on   the   arrest   or
         imprisonment  of  at  least  193  Christians  for  their  religious
         affiliation or activities in 2016.  Authorities continued to arrest
         members of unrecognized churches for operating illegally in private
         homes or on charges of supporting  and  accepting  assistance  from
         "enemy" countries.   Many  arrests  reportedly  took  place  during
         police raids on religious gatherings and included confiscations  of
         religious property.  News reports stated that Christians  who  were
         arrested  were  subject  to  severe  physical   and   psychological
         mistreatment by authorities, which at times included  beatings  and
         solitary confinement".


69. In order to examine the figure of 193  in  greater  detail  Mrs  Enayat
    looked to a joint statement issued by 19 human rights organisations and
    published in November 2016 by the Hrana News Agency. This reported that
    many of those arrests took place during  the  summer,  with  groups  of
    Christians being targeted at seemingly innocuous events such as  family
    picnics:

         "Between May and August 2016, in locations  across  Iran,  security
         forces arrested a total of 79  Christians,  according  to  informed
         sources,  family  members,  and  friends.  The  majority  of  those
         arrested were interrogated and detained for periods ranging from  a
         few days to months. At the  time  of  writing,  some  of  these  79
         Christians remain in detention and have  still  not  been  formally
         charged. Rights  groups  believe  the  true  number  of  Christians
         apprehended by the authorities could be  notably  higher,  as  many
         arrests would have gone unreported".


70. In their analysis of the 2016 figures Landinfo focus on two  particular
    events reported by 'Human Rights Without Frontiers'. The  first  was  a
    series of raids on house churches that took place in the city of  Rashd
    in May. Of the four individuals named as having been  detained,  Pastor
    Naderkhani  was  the  most  prominent.  He  had  gained   international
    recognition after he was sentenced to death for apostasy in 2011: it is
    perhaps for that reason that he was quickly released, being bailed  the
    same day.   The three arrested with  him,  Mohammadreza  Omidi,  Yasser
    Mossayebzadeh and Saheb Fadaie, were held for  between  2  to  3  weeks
    before being bailed for $33,000.  They were all  brought  to  trial  in
    June 2017 and sentenced to 10 years  in  prison,  plus  80  lashes  for
    drinking communion wine.   Although the charges against  them  included
    familiar accusations such as  "conspiracy  against  national  security"
    they were also accused of accepting British funds.  Landinfo  describes
    these three as being members of Naderkhani's house church:

         "The three other church members who were arrested together with him
         are not particularly well-known names, and little has been  written
         about them in English-language  media.  Therefore,  it  is  unclear
         which type of activity and what type of  roles  they  have  had  in
         Naderkhani's house church. However, a CSW news report  states  that
         all three men were  briefly  arrested  during  a  similar  raid  in
         February 2015. Omidi was imprisoned the first time  during  a  raid
         against the house churches in December 2012. In 2013, he was one of
         four Christians who  were  sentenced  to  80  lashes  for  drinking
         alcohol during communion."

71.  The  second  incident  occurred  on  the  26th  August  2016  when  17
    Christians, mainly converts, were arrested at a  picnic  in  a  private
    garden in Firouzkouh.  Five individuals arrested that day are named  in
    the sources. Two, Hadi Asgari and Amin Afshar Naderi, are described  as
    house church leaders: they were sentenced respectively  to  10  and  15
    years in prison although by mid-2017 both had  been  released  on  bail
    pending appeal.  One, Ramil  Bet-Tamraz,  was  not  a  convert  but  an
    Assyrian: it is however worth noting  that  he  had  once  before  been
    arrested for attending a house church (in December 2014)  and  that  he
    remained in custody for at least two months before  being  released  on
    bail pending his trial, at which he was  eventually  sentenced  to  ten
    years in prison. The fourth man was Amir Saman Dashti who  spent  three
    months in Evin before he was bailed on charges including "having a non-
    Islamic party". We note that in her commentary on his case  Mrs  Enayat
    describes Amir Dashti as a young convert who had  never  been  arrested
    before. He was eventually sentenced to four months  in  prison  but  on
    what basis it is unclear.  The last man was Mohammad Dehnavi,  of  whom
    nothing is known bar that he was kept in Evin  prison  for  some  three
    months before he was released. Landinfo comment that he "appears to  be
    an example of an arrested convert  without  a  known  profile.  Because
    sources hardly mention him, it  indicates  that  he  had  less  visible
    activity".


72. In their 2017 Report on International Religious Freedom  the  US  State
    Department  contend  that  in  that  year   "Christians,   particularly
    evangelicals  and  converts  from  Islam,   continued   to   experience
    disproportionate levels of arrests and detention, and  high  levels  of
    harassment and surveillance". Similar conclusions are drawn by  Article
    18. The actual figure of those detained is however difficult to  gauge.
    The 2018 CPIN quotes Open Doors UK who give  a  figure  of  52  arrests
    throughout the year. If that is correct, we have  not  been  given  the
    particulars of all of those incidents. The material before us gives the
    detail of 2 people arrested in  February  (Landinfo),  1  in  May  (Mrs
    Enayat), 10 in July (in two separate incidents reported by  Mrs  Enayat
    and the Danish report), 3 in November (Mrs Enayat and Article 18) and 7
    in December ('Christians in Chains' article and US State Department): a
    total of only 23. Whatever the true number there is  a  clear  decrease
    from 2016.  That said we note that in each of  those  identified  cases
    those arrested were spending months, rather than  days,  in  detention.
    Whether in pre-trial detention  or  upon  conviction,  the  individuals
    mentioned in the reports spent between several months and  5  years  in
    prison.    2017  is  also  notable  for  the  series  of   high-profile
    convictions of Christians who had been arrested in previous years.  The
    US  State  Department  identifies   one   particular   judge   of   the
    Revolutionary Court in Tehran as having taken a particularly hard line.
    In June and July of 2017 Judge Ahmadzadeh presided over three  separate
    trials in which he handed down sentences of between 10 and 15 years  to
    12 men, convicted on charges such as "assembly  and  collusion  against
    the state" and "Christian Zionism".


73. As to the  profile  of  those  arrested  during  2017,  we  find  three
    individuals of particular interest.  Fatemeh Bakhteri, arrested in  May
    at her home in Rasht is identified as being the organiser of the  house
    church held on the premises; Saroush Saraie arrested in Shiraz in  July
    has a relatively high profile, having been arrested a number  of  times
    before; Mrs Enayat believes that Majidreza Souzanchi Kushani,  detained
    in Tehran in November, "may have been the leader of the house  church".
    Other than that, there is no suggestion that the remaining  individuals
    arrested were in leadership roles in any church.

74. Landinfo report that Anousheh Reza-Bakhsh and Soheil  Zagarzadeh  Sani,
    arrested in Urmia in February, were a mother and son arrested in  their
    home.  It is unclear what they are accused of,  but  neither  had  been
    arrested before.  Middle East Concern reported that the  two  had  been
    baptised in Istanbul in August 2016, and that they had returned to Iran
    where they continued to read and learn about the Christian faith.  When
    Mohabat News reported on their case some 3� months after their  arrest,
    "their fate was uncertain".   Fatimeh Mohammadi, arrested  in  November
    2017, was a nineteen-year-old student detained during a raid on a house
    church.   She spent six  months  in  Evin.   Of  her  case  Mrs  Enayat
    comments: "it is striking that she was accused not of evangelism but of
    "membership in evangelical groups" (ow z viat dar grouha-ye t abas  har
    i), and "engaging in Christian  activity"  (fa'aliat-e  massihiat)"  as
    well as "actions against national security through  propaganda  against
    the system".  Finally, no information is available about the  group  of
    nine Catholic converts arrested in a park in  Tehran  other  than  that
    contained in the 2018 Danish report: that at least five were  held  for
    interrogation, two of whom fled the country upon  their  release.   The
    other three remained in detention when  the  report  was  published  in
    February 2018.


75. Amnesty International  designated  2018  as  'Iran's  Year  of  Shame',
    stating that the organisation is aware of at least 171 Christians being
    detained by the end of the year.  The majority  of  these  arrests  are
    said to have taken place in a series of raids in December, when as many
    as 150 people were detained. Whilst that  assertion  was  not  directly
    disputed by the Respondent, we note that the 2019 CPIN cast some  doubt
    on the provenance of those reports. Mrs Enayat  therefore  explains  in
    detail the source of the  information  on  the  December  arrests.  The
    original report appeared on the website of the semi-official Mehr  news
    agency on the 1st December:

         "An  evangelical  network  linked  to  the   current   of   Zionist
         Christianity has been dealt with. Some of  its  members  have  been
         identified and a number arrested.  Besides  domestic  elements  the
         members of this gang included foreigners who, under  the  direction
         of  the  Zionist  regime,  while  spreading  evangelical  Christian
         propaganda in various areas of our  country  have  recruited  large
         numbers to their sect...."

76. On the 5th December Article 18 issued a press release stating  that  it
    was aware that 114 people had been arrested over the  past  week:  this
    referred to the Mehr news piece  but  was  also  based  on  information
    provided by its own sources. By  the  13th  December  Mohabat  News  (a
    Christian news agency)  had  added  this:  "some  28  others  had  been
    arrested in the preceding three weeks [before 27/28 November]  bringing
    the total for one month to 142". The source for that  figure  was  once
    again Article 18.   Mrs Enayat is not in a position to verify the exact
    details of the claims, but she points out that  an  important  part  of
    Article 18's work is to lobby politicians in the West  to  support  the
    Christian community in Iran. To that end it must be confident that  the
    information it provides, gathered from contacts in Iran and Turkey, can
    be relied upon.  Towards the end of the month confirmation came from  a
    source known to be close to the Revolutionary Guard - the  Tansim  news
    agency - that a further 9 arrests had been made in Karaj, bringing  the
    total of known detentions in December 2018 to 149.


77. As to who was being arrested in 2018, there is no clear indication that
    any of these individuals were 'leaders' or persons  who  were  actively
    evangelising. Aziz Majidzadeh, arrested in a house church in Karaj with
    9 others in March is simply described as a "young convert": he was held
    for over two months before being released  on  bail.    Similarly,  the
    five men named by Article 18 as having been arrested in Karaj  in  June
    are simply described as 'Christians', and their names do not appear  in
    any earlier reports. The same can be said for the two sisters  arrested
    at the beginning of December and held without charge for almost a month
    - allegedly so that their bruises could  heal.  Another  case  of  what
    appears to be 'ordinary' Christians facing arrest is one that attracted
    much attention: that of  the  five  ladies  detained  whilst  having  a
    gathering at the home of 65-year-old Mrs Mahrokh  (Rokhsare)  Ghanbari.
    It is  reported  that  the  security  services  raided  the  house  and
    confiscated mobile phones, Bibles and  other  Christian  materials.  Ms
    Ghanbari was  held  for  10  days  during  which  she  was  subject  to
    intensive, day long interrogations, and released on bail  of  US$2,500.
    She was brought before the court who directed her to "return to Islam".
    It is notable that the final charge brought against her was "propaganda
    against the system" for which she received a  sentence  of  1  year  in
    prison. As Mrs Enayat observes, given that no charges were  brought  of
    the 'unlawful organisation' variety it can be  assumed  that  even  the
    Iranian security services realised she was doing no more  than  hosting
    her friends in her home.  Of all the 2018  incidents  detailed  in  the
    material before us only one appears to relate to people  already  known
    to the authorities: this was the detention of the  three  men  arrested
    with Naderkhani and bailed the preceding  year  (Mossayebzadeh,  Fadaei
    and Omidi). Their arrest in July was following a decision of the appeal
    court to uphold their June 2017 convictions:  they are each  serving  a
    sentence of ten years' imprisonment.


78. It would appear that in the  majority  of  these  arrests,  those  that
    occurred in the first two weeks of December, individuals were picked up
    during raids on house churches and held for a short period before being
    released upon undertaking to cease Christian activities and  return  to
    Islam.

79. The figures for 2019 were as yet incomplete at the date that  we  heard
    the appeal. We  were  however  provided  with  some  preliminary  data,
    provided primarily by Article 18, and  by  Mrs  Enayat's  collation  of
    press  reports  and  human  rights  alerts.  It  is  believed  that   4
    individuals were arrested in January, 14 in February, 28 over March and
    April, 1 at Tehran Airport in May, and in  July  8,  possibly  9,  were
    arrested in Bushehr.


80. Of the 55 (or 56) individuals reported as arrested between January  and
    July 2019 we know that at least 10 are deemed to be church  leaders  or
    elders.  Ismaeil Maghrebinejad, detained in Shiraz in January converted
    from Islam 40 years ago. Article 18 are said to  report  that  "he  has
    been regularly harassed by security officials, including an attempt  to
    kill him". Pastor Abdolreza Matthias Haghnejad of the  Church  of  Iran
    was detained in February as he concluded a sermon at a house church  in
    Rasht; again, he was well known to the  Iranian  authorities  who  have
    arrested him on many occasions. Mrs Enayat describes  the  other  eight
    people arrested in the course  of  the  same  investigation  as  "other
    leading members of the church".

81. Conversely others do not seem to have any 'profile'  other  than  being
    practising Christians.  Mrs Enayat reports on the case of  26-year  old
    Sina Moloudian, beaten and snatched from his family home in Isfahan  by
    eight security service officers and taken to Dastgerd  prison.   The  8
    people arrested in Bushehr in July were  all  extended  family  members
    whose homes were searched and  Bibles,  Christian  statues  and  signs,
    wooden crosses, paintings, laptops, cellphones,  ID  cards  and  credit
    cards confiscated. Mrs Khatoon Fatolahzadeh, who is 61 years  old,  was
    released the same day but her sons, daughters-in-law  and  others  were
    not bailed until the 16th and 17th July, having been held  in  solitary
    confinement for those two weeks.  They have been charged with  "actions
    against  national  security",  "gathering  and  collusion  against  the
    state", and "membership of an illegal organisation".   In  other  cases
    those arrested are  simply  described  as  'Christians',  for  instance
    Shahrooz Easlamdous,  Babak  Hosseinzadeh,  Behnam  Akhlagh  and  Mehdi
    Khatibi, all arrested in February 2019.  In the  case  of  Mrs  Fatemeh
    Azad, a 58-year old woman arrested on arrival in  Tehran  earlier  this
    year, Mr Payne asked us to note that the  authorities  appear  to  have
    been waiting for her, and to infer from that there must be  some  other
    relevant factor that as yet remains obscure.  On  the  evidence  we  do
    have, that appears to be unlikely: German newspaper Bild tells us  that
    she was removed from Germany  because  the  authorities  had  not  been
    satisfied that she was a genuine convert.   She  is  reported  to  have
    attended church whilst in Germany but no links to any Iranian  churches
    are mentioned.

82. Pulling all of that together we make the following findings.

83. First, for the reasons we set out above, the figures we have  can  give
    us no more than a snapshot of conditions at any given time. They cannot
    be considered to be exact, and we accept that there will be incidents -
    particularly short term 'disruptive detentions' and people being called
    in for questioning - which are for the individual involved routine, and
    so go unreported.  We are however satisfied that the evidence  shows  a
    clear trend towards an increase in the use of detention and prosecution
    as a means of disrupting Christian practice in Iran.


84. Aside from the increase, the other  immediately  obvious  point  to  be
    drawn from these figures is  that  the  fluctuating  numbers  of  those
    arrested year to year corresponds with the information  we  have  about
    house church raids.  That leads us to  our  conclusions  about  who  is
    being targeted in these operations.


85. We agree with the analysis in SZ & FM that those who are  perceived  to
    be church leaders or activists face a real risk of harm.   It is  clear
    from the extremely long sentences handed down to figures such as Pastor
    Naderkhani that the authorities believe that the most effective way  to
    undermine organised Christianity it to target its leaders.

86. We do not however find it safe to assume  that  'ordinary'  Christians,
    that is to say individuals with no  role  beyond  attending  collective
    worship at house churches, escape the  attention  of  the  authorities.
    On a general level the language used by the sources indicates  that  to
    the contrary, simply being a Christian is enough to get  you  arrested:
    "authorities continued to arrest  members  of  unrecognized  churches",
    "many arrests reportedly took place during police  raids  on  religious
    gatherings", "Christians, particularly evangelicals and  converts  from
    Islam, continued to experience disproportionate levels of  arrests  and
    detention".

87.  Upon more detailed examination these general comments are shown to  be
    justified. Of the large number of arrests in 2016 only a proportion are
    named, and only a handful of these are  identified  as  having  leading
    roles in the house church movement.  Of the individuals  identified  as
    being arrested in 2017 we find only three with any prominence:  Fatemeh
    Bakhteri, Saroush Saraie and Majidreza  Souzanchi  Kushani.   In  equal
    number we are given the details of  'ordinary'  Christians  subject  to
    extraordinary punishments: the mother and son from Urmia who apparently
    spent at least 3� months in prison after being picked up at  home,  the
    nineteen-year old  student  simply  charged  with  'membership'  -  not
    'organisation' - of a banned group, for which she served six months  in
    Evin.   There does not appear to be any dispute that  the  majority  of
    those detained in the Christmas raids of 2018  were  not  leaders,  but
    simply those in attendance at meetings; in these cases  the  length  of
    detention is not specified so it can be assumed (as we understand it to
    have been by Mrs Enayat) that many were released after a  short  period
    of between 24 hours and a week.  Given what we know about  the  charges
    brought, and sentences  handed  down,  to  known  activists,  it  seems
    unlikely that any of this  group  could  be  considered  to  be  church
    organisers.  As for the rest of that year, there is clear  evidence  of
    'ordinary' church members being targeted: see for instance the case  of
    "young convert" Aziz Majidzadeh.  In respect of arrests  in  the  first
    half of 2019, only 10 of the known 55 are identified by Mrs  Enayat  as
    "leading members of the  church".   The  remaining  80%  appear  to  be
    'ordinary' Christians who  were  gathered  in  private  homes  for  the
    purpose of collective worship.




    Ill-treatment


88. It is not the case that every detainee in Iran will suffer physical ill-
    treatment. In many of the incidents described in the material, there is
    no mention at all of  physical  harm,  and  in  some  it  is  expressly
    acknowledged that none took place.  There is some suggestion  that  the
    Iranian security services will deliberately seek to avoid torturing  or
    beating Christian detainees because of the international attention that
    physical injury might attract.  The Secretary of  State  understandably
    seeks to emphasise that, particularly in  relation  to  the  short-term
    disruptive detentions  which  form  part  of  the  overall  pattern  of
    restriction and control of  the  Christian  community.   Mr  Payne  was
    however prepared to accept that we can  'take  as  read'  a  reasonable
    likelihood of persecutory ill-treatment in any detention of a  week  or
    more.


89. In light of that concession we need not repeat or summarise all of  the
    evidence of physical ill-treatment that we were given, but we think  it
    important to note that physical ill-treatment is very often accompanied
    by 'mental torture'. This is significant because it  gives  context  to
    those situations in which only psychological techniques are employed: a
    detainee who is being subject to verbal threats  will  know  very  well
    that there is the ever-present danger of it escalating to  serious,  or
    more serious, physical harm. The example  is  used  by  Mrs  Enayat  of
    Mustafa Shokrollahi, who escaped Iran for Turkey and  from  there  gave
    the following evidence to the United Kingdom  All  Party  Parliamentary
    Group on the Persecution of Christians in Iran:

         "Four people stood there and took it in turns to shout  and  scream
         at me or beat me and slap me in the face... I asked  about  how  my
         wife was once and they began really beating me, beating from behind
         and in front and if I said something they did not like  they  would
         bash me. They tried to make me cooperate, saying: "We will  cripple
         you for the rest of your life, you will carry it with you that  you
         did not cooperate." They asked a lot about Elam, about the  members
         of my churches and asked me for my email password. I had one  email
         account that wasn't very important. I gave them that email  address
         password. They realised this was not my main account and they  said
         in the interrogation session the next day, "Give us  your  password
         for your main email account." This email  account  would  prove  my
         communication with Farshid [Fathi], so I refused to give it. I said
         "My password is personal". They said "We  will  show  you  what  is
         personal". They made me stand up and stripped  off  my  shorts  and
         they threatened to rape me. So I gave the  password.  They  lay  me
         down and whipped me.  They  kept  beating  me  on  the  head.  They
         regularly   would   threaten   me   with   execution   during   the
         interrogations. This process of interrogations took 29 days".

90.  Asked  specifically  about  the  risks  arising  during   short   term
    detentions, that is to say those lasting less than a week,  Mrs  Enayat
    accepted that in many instances the reports thereof make no mention  of
    ill-treatment. She did however stress the following matters.


91. First, that very often the individual concerned will  not  divulge  the
    details of any ill-treatment because he does not want it in the  public
    domain: we accept that this may be the  case,  particularly  where  the
    harm was of a particularly humiliating - perhaps sexual - nature.

92. Second, that in many cases the reporting agencies will  not  bother  to
    mention specific details because it can be assumed that a  detainee  of
    the Iranian security services will have been subject to  some  form  of
    ill-treatment, be that mental or  physical.    That  this  was  so  was
    illustrated by Mrs Enayat's responses to questions put by Mr Payne.  He
    took her  to  a  section  of  her  report  where  she  had  listed  the
    experiences of several detainees. She had not made any reference to ill-
    treatment in any of these examples, but when asked whether she knew  if
    any  had  occurred  Mrs  Enayat  responded  by  stating  that  to   her
    recollection each of the prisoners she had mentioned had  been  subject
    to harms including: sensory deprivation such as being kept in  solitary
    confinement in total darkness; sensory overload such as  being  exposed
    to constant bright  light  and  loud  noise;  threats  to  friends  and
    relatives  - including those individuals being brought into the custody
    suite so that the  subject  knows  that  they  too  are  in  detention;
    misinformation, for instance the individual being told that  they  have
    been betrayed by someone close to  them.  In  some  of  the  cases  the
    individuals, or family members, were also beaten.

93. This led to Mrs Enayat's third point  on  this  matter.  That  is  that
    regardless of whether physical harm was inflicted, it  can  be  assumed
    that some form of psychological harm would have been attempted.  It  is
    the norm for prisoners to be held in  solitary  confinement,  at  least
    until interrogation  is  over;  interrogation  sessions  are  long  and
    aggressive; detainees are routinely taunted  and  threatened  with  the
    most serious charges.   There  are  also  examples  of  pressure  being
    exerted on detainees by the withholding of vital medication.

94. We accept the Secretary of State's submission  that  there  will  be  a
    reasonable  likelihood  of  ill-treatment  for  any  Christian  convert
    detained for a week or more in Iran. As to the  risk  of  such  serious
    harm arising in shorter detentions or interrogation sessions we  cannot
    exclude the possibility, but there is a lack of evidence to demonstrate
    that it is being widely used.   We accept that  psychological  pressure
    will very often be applied. In the context of a  short  detention  this
    would likely include threats and intimidation, but probably not extreme
    interrogation techniques such as sensory overload, which would normally
    be employed over a longer period.


    Risk on Return


95. As to general procedures on return we  informed  the  parties  that  we
    would be following the guidance in SSH & HR. We were  however  provided
    with  the  following  additional  material  specifically  relating   to
    Christians, or persons claiming to be Christians.

96. The Respondent's position can be summarised by the February  2019  CPIN
    Iran: Illegal exit, which cites the 2018 conclusions of the  Australian
    Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade [at 6.1.2]:

         "According to  international  observers,  Iranian  authorities  pay
         little attention to failed asylum seekers on their return to  Iran.
         Iranians have left the country in  large  numbers  since  the  1979
         revolution, and authorities accept that many will seek to live  and
         work overseas for economic reasons. International observers  report
         that Iranian authorities have little interest in prosecuting failed
         asylum seekers for activities conducted outside Iran, including  in
         relation to protection claims. This includes posting  social  media
         comments critical of the  government  -  heavy  internet  filtering
         means  most  Iranians  will  never  see  them   -   converting   to
         Christianity, or engaging in LGBTI activities. In  such  cases  the
         risk profile for the individual will be the same as for  any  other
         person in Iran within that category. Those with  an  existing  high
         profile may face a higher risk of coming to official  attention  on
         return to Iran, particularly political activists".

97. The Respondent further relied on the contents of  two  Danish  reports,
    from 2018 and 2014.   Four of  the  respondents  to  the  2018  report,
    including Amnesty International and the  IOM,  did  not  think  that  a
    returning asylum seeker would encounter any difficulties as a result of
    Christian activities abroad.  The exceptions to this were  Middle  East
    Concern, who believe that a baptism could  lead  to  problems,  and  an
    unidentified 'international organisation' operating in Turkey who think
    that converts returning  to  Iran  are  interrogated  "in  relation  to
    perceived threats to society and to the Iranian regime".  In 2014  Elam
    Ministries reported that they  had  decided  to  cease  their  training
    operation in Turkey after over 500 people were  arrested  returning  to
    Iran in the preceding few years. Elam told the Danish researchers: "the
    reason behind this high number is that the  authorities  have  obtained
    quite a bit of information about how the  house  churches  operate.  It
    also seems that the Iranian authorities have agents in Turkey that know
    of what work Elam is doing there".  When asked when people  who  return
    from training or other  activities  in  Turkey  are  taken  in  by  the
    authorities, Elam said that it could be at the airport or on  the  road
    after passing back into Iran or a few days after returning.

98. Some of the respondents to the Danish research highlighted that  social
    media activity might increase the risk to a returnee,  particularly  if
    they were "very outspoken" or seen to be "propagating Christianity"  (a
    'western embassy'). Middle  East  Concern  and  two  anonymous  sources
    thought that the Iranian security services  would  conduct  an  overall
    evaluation of any online content. They would be interested  in  whether
    it demonstrated that the individual was actively engaged  in  promoting
    Christianity. They would not be so interested in someone who  had  used
    "copy paste" phrases - we understood this  to  include  content  copied
    from another source or 'liked' on a social media platform.  Middle East
    Concern agreed, and stated that a Facebook  declaration  of  conversion
    would lead to monitoring but not necessarily persecution.

99. In her evidence on the returns process Mrs Enayat  sets  out  extensive
    evidence indicating that a returnee travelling on an  emergency  travel
    document obtained from the embassy in London will already be  'flagged'
    to the authorities as someone who has  claimed  asylum  in  the  United
    Kingdom.   They will be subject to interrogation on arrival,  and  this
    will include questioning about the asylum claim.  We do not regard  any
    of this as being in contradiction to the findings of  the  Tribunal  in
    SSH & HR.   Mrs Enayat adds that during this  initial  questioning  the
    reasons for the asylum claim will be revealed by the subject, who  will
    be fearful that it will already be known to the authorities:

         "Given the effort and resources put into the surveillance of  house
         church activity in Iran, and  the  belief  that  the  house  church
         networks are driven by foreign money and even  managed  by  foreign
         elements, coupled with the known Iranian surveillance  of  diaspora
         political activity, it is reasonable to conclude  that  agents  are
         also  deployed  to  watch  convert  communities   abroad.    Church
         communities certainly believe this is so".

100. On the matter of whether a  returnee  with  a  Christian-related  claim
    would be subject to any increased scrutiny Mrs  Enayat's  evidence  has
    not been consistent.  In  HB  (Kurds)  the  Tribunal  appended  to  its
    decision its summary of the evidence given by Mrs Enayat on the  impact
    of such questioning [at Appendix B, paragraph 10]:

         "Even in relation to someone who could be  said  to  have  made  up
         stories to make their asylum case better, the  point  is  that  the
         authorities would regard it as besmirching their name and  accusing
         them of human rights violations.  If someone were to say that  they
         had pretended to convert but had not really, that  would  be  okay.
         If it was a genuine conversion they would probably pressure you  to
         recant.  But if one was making up a political statement it  is  not
         so easy to say that that was all 'rubbish'.  When  pressed  on  the
         matter Mrs Enayat responded to state that she felt  she  was  being
         asked questions that she could not answer".

101. In her report  for  this  case  Mrs  Enayat  stated  that  it  was  her
    considered view that in fact the authorities  would  be  interested  in
    someone who had said that he was Christian:


         "Anyone subjected to enforced removal, or  anyone  who  returns  on
         temporary documentation (an ETD) will be questioned. If it  emerges
         in the course of questioning that a returnee has been  involved  in
         religious or political activity while abroad that is likely to mean
         detention for further questioning


         The  Iranian  authorities  view   converts,   who   in   Iran   are
         overwhelmingly linked to evangelical strands  of  Christianity,  as
         vehicles of a Western plot or  plots  to  destabilize  the  Islamic
         Republic and undermine the religion of Islam....


         ....  Further,  the  authorities  do  not  just  view   evangelical
         Christianity as an undesirable  ideology:  they  portray  it  as  a
         subversive movement capable of  mobilising  organized  cadres  (aka
         housechurches/housechurch networks) for its purposes.  Converts  to
         Christianity are, in other words,  viewed  in  the  same  light  as
         political activists"


102. She explained that her evidence in HB  had  not  been  about  Christian
    claims. She had not been prepared to answer questions  about  that  and
    had been put on the spot under cross-examination:  she  had  just  been
    seeking to emphasise the regime's particular sensitivity towards  Kurds
    and it had been an off-the-cuff comparison.  She had made clear to  the
    Tribunal that she could not be expected to give a complete analysis  of
    the position of 'Christian' returnees because that was not the  subject
    that she had prepared for in attending that  hearing.  Upon  reflection
    she thinks that in fact a returnee  whose  claim  had  been  rooted  in
    Christian  activity  would  be  likely  to  be   subject   to   further
    investigation, which in her view would lead to ill-treatment.


103. Asked about what specific factors might  excite  the  interest  of  the
    authorities in a 'Christian' case Mrs Enayat said this:


         "If a returnee has been baptised he or she will  be  viewed  as  an
         apostate because they have publicly  turned  away  from  Islam.  As
         explained earlier they are unlikely to be prosecuted for  apostasy.
         But they have broken Iranian law and will be treated  as  a  person
         who has committed a religious offence. It is very difficult to  say
         precisely how the  baptism  per  se  will  be  dealt  with  by  the
         authorities - in part because not all the converts arrested in Iran
         have been baptised and many have been persecuted for  what  may  be
         described as "standard Christian activities...


         If a person has been an  active  Christian  but  not  baptised  the
         distinction between Church attendance and baptism is likely  to  be
         academic for the authorities....


         When considering the situation of an individual who  has  converted
         in Europe who then returns to Iran, their situation would  be  much
         the same as that of Iranians who convert in Iran".


104. In that regard Mrs Enayat repeats her evidence about  what  happens  to
    an 'in-country' convert: he is taken into custody and required to  sign
    an undertaking. He may be monitored  to  ensure  compliance  with  that
    undertaking.   She  cautioned  however  that  even  if  a  returnee  is
    perfectly willing to sign  the  document  (i.e.  in  the  case  of  the
    disingenuous claimant) there may still be a problem:


         "The authorities are well  aware  of  the  strategic  signature  of
         disclaimers and are unlikely to be  immediately  convinced  that  a
         returnee who professes a baptism of  convenience  is  speaking  the
         truth and will not turn out to  be  a  covert  Christian  activist.
         (Note  the  scepticism  of  "a   representatives   of   the   Union
         Church"[Istanbul] speaking to a  Danish  Fact  Finding  Mission  in
         2013: "The source did not consider that there would be less risk to
         an individual who returns to Iran after being baptized in a Western
         country if the individual renounces the baptism and explains it  to
         be part of a strategy for coming to the West. This would  work  for
         their families, but maybe not for the government authorities.)  The
         fact that someone signs a renunciation does not mean they would not
         be subject to punishment, usually  pursuant  to  national  security
         laws,  for  the  activities  they  have  been  involved  in  as  an
         apostate."


105.  She  adds  that  because  of  the  regime's  insistent   equation   of
    Christianity with Western political influence, denials may fall on deaf
    ears:


         "A returnee from the UK who has been baptized,  and  long  involved
         with  an  evangelical/protestant  church,  will   be   particularly
         susceptible to suspicions arising from this mindset".


    It is therefore likely, in Mrs Enayat's view, that on  arrival  such  a
    returnee will be subject to arrest  followed  by  short-term,  probably
    abusive,  detention  for  investigation.  He  will  then  be  released,
    possibly on bail pending  further  investigation;  he  will  likely  be
    monitored and subject to recall.  She concludes that "it  is  important
    not to overestimate the rationality and underestimate the  paranoia  of
    the Iranian authorities - it is long standing and pervasive".


106. Mrs Enayat has identified the following recent cases  of  Iranians  who
    claim to have converted to Christianity being returned to Iran:


        i) The four members of  the  Hekmatara  family  were  removed  from
           Norway on the 15th January 2014.  The mother  and  two  children
           were reportedly given entry but the father was held  for  a  few
           days  before  being  released  on  bail.  The  Hekmatara  family
           subsequently left Iran again and were eventually  recognised  as
           refugees in Norway.

       ii) Unidentified individual removed from Norway in January 2014.  He
           was tracked by the  Norwegian  Association  for  Asylum  Seekers
           (NOAS) who reported that he was held for less than a month after
           his arrival and tortured.  He managed to  escape  from  Iran  in
           March 2014 and returned to Turkey where  his  asylum  claim  was
           processed by UNHCR.

      iii) Unidentified individual removed from  Norway  on  20th  February
           2014. He was again tracked by NOAS  who  were  informed  by  his
           family that he was detained on arrival and that as of May he was
           still in prison. His identity was kept secret at the request  of
           his family who feared aggravating his situation.

       iv)  Shahrzad  Sakiani,  whose  removal  from  Norway  in  2015  was
           frustrated by her lack of identity papers. She was refused entry
           at Tehran airport and returned  to  Norway.  She  reported  that
           during her questioning a crucifix was ripped from her neck.


        v) Behrooz Kafaei Zendehel was removed  from  Norway  on  the  18th
           January 2018.   He was held 'for a few days' during which he was
           tortured and threatened with execution before being released  on
           bail. He managed to escape again to Turkey where he  applied  to
           the UNHCR for asylum.   He  was  recognised  as  a  refugee  and
           settled in Norway as a quota refugee.

       vi) Fatemeh Azad was removed from Germany  in  May  2019  after  her
           claim to be a Christian was rejected.  A 58-year-old woman,  she
           was reported by Bild to have been detained on arrival.  She  has
           no known profile other than the fact that she had been attending
           church and had been baptised in Germany. It  is  not  known  how
           long she was held for, but it is reported that she was  released
           after a relative put up bail.

107. The bundle further contained a news  report  from  'Iran  News  Update'
    stating that on the 10th February 2014 a young man and his  uncle  were
    arrested at Tehran airport as  they  disembarked  from  a  flight  from
    Armenia. They were reportedly taken in for questioning by  plainclothes
    officers affiliated with the Revolutionary Guard. A  week  later  their
    families were  told  that  the  men  had  been  charged  with  offences
    including "making contact with  Christian  networks  abroad,  apostasy,
    converting from Islam to Christianity, and for  promoting  Christianity
    inside the country".


108. Of all of the evidence before us it  was  this  material,  relating  to
    risk on return, that we found most difficult to evaluate. Although  the
    joint Danish reports canvassed a wide  range  of  opinion  it  was  not
    possible for us to know how much of it was based on empirical evidence,
    and what was  simply  speculation.  Although  well-known  human  rights
    organisations are cited, the Danish  reports  routinely  anonymise  the
    identity of many sources. In this instance the sources  offering  their
    opinions on what might happen  to  a  returning  Christian  included  a
    "foreigner interacting with Christians in Iran",  "a  western  embassy"
    and simply "an anonymous source".  We note that in Sufi and Elmi v  the
    United Kingdom (Applications  nos.  8319/07  and  11449/07)  the  ECtHR
    cautioned that it will be "virtually impossible" for a court to  assess
    the reliability of such evidence, where  the  nature  of  the  source's
    operations in the country in question are  unknown.   It  is  therefore
    only where the information provided  accords  with  other,  verifiable,
    information, that we are able to place any significant weight upon  it.
     The information provided by Elam Ministries was striking  -  over  500
    arrests in the period 2011-2014 -but was difficult  to  reconcile  with
    the evidence that we have on detentions  overall,  only  a  handful  of
    which relate to people who have returned from Turkey.

109. Before us Mrs Enayat was placed in some difficulty by her  evidence  in
    HB. In there seeking to emphasise the  particular  sensitivity  of  the
    regime to Kurdish activism, she sought to  draw  contrast  between  the
    returning Kurd and a 'run of the mill' returnee: "if  someone  were  to
    say that they had pretended to convert but had not really,  that  would
    be okay".  We accept that she had not been prepared to answer questions
    on Christianity when she attended the hearing in HB and  that  she  was
    therefore to some extent 'on the spot'. We do however also have to take
    account of the fact that she has clearly spent much of the last  decade
    closely monitoring the situation for Christians in Iran: whilst it  may
    have been an off-the-cuff remark, it was one informed by her very great
    expertise on this topic.   We  have  taken  that  into  account  whilst
    evaluating her subsequent,  contrasting,  evidence.    Mrs  Enayat  has
    however compiled, from other sources,  the  list  of  recent  cases  of
    returnees being arrested, and she has set that in the  context  of  her
    wider knowledge about the modus operandi of the security  services;  it
    is this element of her evidence that we found most helpful.

110. We remind ourselves of the  underlying  reasoning  in  SSH  &  HR.  The
    Iranian authorities know very well that many Iranians leave the country
    to seek asylum in the West, and that when  they  do  so,  they  advance
    protection claims that by their nature will involve some  criticism  of
    the Iranian state.   The Tribunal rejected the contention that  it  was
    reasonably likely that the Iranians  would  frame  this  as  propaganda
    against  the  regime.   On  the  contrary,  the  evidence  before  them
    indicated that an Iranian who had made up a story  in  order  to  claim
    asylum could re-enter the country without difficulty.  It is only where
    'particular concerns' arise that the subject will be sent  for  further
    questioning, and it  is  in  this  second-line  questioning  where  the
    potential for ill-treatment will arise.

111. Against this background  we  have  no  hesitation  in  finding  that  a
    genuine Christian would face serious difficulties on arrival in Tehran.
    Asked about the basis of his claim for asylum, he cannot be expected to
    lie.  The interviewer will quickly establish that here is an individual
    who has been attending church abroad, and who has perhaps been baptised
    into this new faith. Here is an  individual  who  would  then,  as  Mrs
    Enayat puts it, be treated like "any other convert". There  is  a  real
    risk that he would be asked to sign an undertaking which amongst  other
    things (see above) would require him  to  renounce  Christianity.   The
    convert who in fear chooses to  sign  that  document  will  be  quickly
    released, but will almost certainly be placed under  surveillance.  The
    effect of that surveillance would be that his ability to  practise  his
    faith in his own country would be completely denied.  The  convert  who
    refuses to recant, and to make the admissions required of  him,  is  on
    the road to martyrdom: even if he manages to avoid ill-treatment during
    this process, he will be detained until he agrees to sign.  Set in  the
    context of the overall evidence  about  the  way  that  Christians  are
    treated, we think it very likely that this is what has happened in  the
    recent cases of return to which we have been referred.   Although  nine
    of the eleven individuals involved had initially failed in their asylum
    claims in Europe, seven were subsequently recognised as refugees, their
    claims to be at risk as practising Christians now apparently  accepted.
    It can be inferred from the  charges  brought  against  the  uncle  and
    nephew returning from Armenia that they already had known house  church
    links.

112. What of the disingenuous claimant?    Mr  Payne  submits  that  on  the
    evidence of reputable organisations such as Amnesty  International  and
    the IOM, there is nothing  to  differentiate  that  variety  of  failed
    asylum seeker from any other. He asks us to apply the ratio in SSH & HR
    and to find that such a  returnee  will  pass  though  the  on-arrivals
    process without any further  questioning  or  difficulty.  Mr  Westgate
    conversely asks us to find that it is the  particular  character  of  a
    conversion-based claim that will give  rise  to  'particular  concerns'
    warranting transfer for further questioning, and the serious harm  that
    could follow. Having considered all  of  the  material  before  us  our
    conclusion lies somewhere in the middle of these two positions.

113. We are satisfied that  a  returnee  who  had  made  a  false  claim  of
    conversion would be reasonably likely to excite sufficient interest  to
    warrant further questioning. His is an asylum claim that is  likely  to
    have depended on sur place activities, including baptism and  attending
    church, prima facie  evidence  of  a  crime  under  Iranian  law.   The
    evidence  overall  indicates  that  the  security  services  follow   a
    specified procedure when it comes to Christians: they are taken in  and
    required to sign the undertaking.  It does not seem likely to  us  that
    this procedure would be followed standing at an arrivals desk, even  if
    the subject was protesting that it  was  all  false  and  that  he  was
    perfectly willing to sign.  A returnee is  not  someone  who  has  been
    picked up on an Iranian street. He is someone who has  just  come  back
    from the United Kingdom, possibly having spent a considerable amount of
    time here; the Iranian security services perceive there to be  a  clear
    link between Christianity and attempts by the  West  to  undermine  the
    Iranian state. These factors cumulatively give rise, in our view, to  a
    "particular concern" such that a transfer  to  second-line  questioning
    would be likely.

114. What then? The person tasked with conducting  that  interrogation  will
    be one who, to put it bluntly, will know what he is  doing.  It  is  an
    important job. His task will be to ensure that this returnee is not  in
    fact a  Western  spy,  or  someone  otherwise  deployed  to  engage  in
    subversive activities such as organising prayer meetings. The  returnee
    will be asked to sign the undertaking. There being no reason for him to
    refuse, he will do so.   He will explain that yes, he  attended  church
    in the United Kingdom, and yes, he may have been baptised, but in  fact
    it was all a charade to try and get asylum so that he could settle  and
    work in the United Kingdom.   The  Iranian  security  services  are  no
    doubt well aware that people make such claims (the Iranian  embassy  in
    London only need read  certain  newspapers  to  know  that  this  is  a
    concern).

115. In SSH & HR the panel were satisfied that during secondary  questioning
    there is the potential for ill-treatment, and given what we know  about
    the behaviour of the Iranian security services generally, this must  be
    right. We are however mindful of Mrs Enayat's evidence  that  returnees
    would be treated like "any other convert".  The  specific  evidence  we
    have been given about what happens when suspected Christians  are  held
    in short 'disruptive detentions' does not indicate that physical  abuse
    is being used. Psychological pressure is applied with the clear  motive
    of frightening the subject into signing an undertaking, and of  thereby
    disrupting house church networks.  In  the  case  of  our  disingenuous
    returnee, the interviewing officer would not have to do much to  ensure
    compliance: he need do no more than ask.   We therefore find that  this
    secondary questioning is generally likely to be very short, perhaps  no
    more than a few hours, and that it will not,  in  those  circumstances,
    involve a real risk of serious  harm.   The  returnee  will  likely  be
    subject to surveillance once he is released, but this will not  involve
    any risk of harm given that he is not a genuine Christian.

116. We accept that this will not  always  be  so.    Risk  assessment  must
    always be fact specific and decision makers must look to the particular
    characteristics and behaviour of claimants to assess whether there is a
    reasonable likelihood  of  physical  harm  during  these  'second-line'
    investigations. We accept the Secretary  of  State's  general  rule  of
    thumb that the longer the detention, the greater the risk  of  torture.
    Decision-makers must therefore assess whether there are any reasons why
    interrogation would be prolonged.   We  do  not  propose  to  offer  an
    exhaustive list of the kind of factors that  might  be  relevant  here,
    since the evidence does not permit us to do so.  We would however  note
    that  one  aggravating  factor  identified  in  the  sources  is  "very
    outspoken" social media  activity:  this  would  have  to  project  the
    personal commitment of the individual, rather than for instance  simply
    'liking' posts  by  others.   Past  adverse  interest  by  the  Iranian
    authorities would also increase risk, as  would  connections  to  other
    individuals with a 'profile'.   We have found that the primary focus of
    the Iranian state is the perceived threat of  organised  religion,  and
    for that reason we are satisfied that association in the United Kingdom
    with a  Church  with  known  links  to  Iranian  house  churches  would
    certainly be a risk factor.

    Our Conclusions


    Analysis

117. Article 1(A)(2) of the Convention relating to the  Status  of  Refugees
    defines a "refugee" as any person who:


         "... owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted  for  reasons
         of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership  of
         a particular social group, is outside the  country  of  nationality
         and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself
         or herself of the protection of that country... or, owing  to  such
         fear, unwilling to return to it."


118. It has never been in issue that there is a  causal  nexus  between  the
    religious belief of Christians in Iran and the harms  that  they  there
    suffer.   The dispute before us concerned the extent  of  those  harms,
    and whether considered in the round, they amounted to a  real  risk  of
    persecution.


119. We find that the situation for  Christians  in  Iran  has  deteriorated
    drastically since the last country guidance  was  published.  The  most
    marked  change  has  been  that  the  Persian-language  churches   then
    permitted to operate openly (albeit with restrictions) have now  almost
    all closed down. Those few that remain do so under the  direct  control
    of the  Ministry  of  Intelligence.   That  means  that  all  remaining
    Christian worship must be conducted 'underground'.

120. As we have seen, there are two  ways  in  which  Christians  can  today
    practise their faith in Iran.

121. There is a group, of  unquantifiable  size,  whose  spiritual  life  is
    confined within the walls of their own home, and whose interaction with
    other Christians is strictly limited to virtual or remote  contact  via
    the internet or  television.  Whilst  we  accept  that  some  of  these
    individuals run the risk of discovery - be that by informants in  their
    community or online surveillance - we do not find it  established  that
    as a group they are at risk per se. These 'hidden believers' are by and
    large able to engage with Christian media content and  to  study  their
    faith in private and in relative safety. We cannot think, however, that
    the life led by these Christians is going to be  particularly  relevant
    to any case before the Tribunal.  That  is  because  protection  claims
    brought in  this  arena  invariably  come  from  individuals  who  have
    asserted - either expressly or impliedly by  their  actions  -  that  a
    fundamental part of their faith is to attend church. It is this  desire
    to take part in collective worship which will expose them to risk.

122. A risk of what? It was the Secretary of State's case before us that  an
    ordinary Christian who attends a house church runs the risk,  at  most,
    of being picked up for a few hours and required to sign an undertaking.
      There being little evidence of physical harm being  inflicted  during
    such encounters, the Secretary of State asks us to discount these short-
    term detentions as falling short of the high threshold of harm required
    to engage the Convention.

123. We are unable to do so.

124. We accept that not all arbitrary detentions amount to  'serious  harm'.
    In Ravichandran v Secretary of State for the Home Department [1996] Imm
    AR the Court of Appeal was asked to  consider  the  position  of  young
    Tamil men at risk of being 'rounded up' on the streets of  Colombo  and
    held for short periods.  The Court directed itself to the hierarchy  of
    rights propounded by Professor Hathaway in The Law of  Refugee  Status:
    freedom from arbitrary detention fell within the second tier of rights,
    which  signatory  states  were  bound  to  protect  except  where  such
    detentions could be justified by for instance, a  state  of  emergency.
    Noting  that  the  government  of  Sri  Lanka  was  seeking  to  combat
    terrorism, Lord Justice Simon Brown found the arrests to be  "obviously
    directed not to the oppression of Tamils as  such  but  rather  to  the
    maintenance of Public Order".   He  went  on  to  underline  the  fact-
    specific nature of the derogation:

         "If the real purpose of these round-ups was to  deprive  Tamils  of
         their liberty simply out  of  hostility  towards  them  (i.e.  with
         "malignancy"), I cannot think that the  loss  of  freedom  involved
         would properly be  held  insufficient  to  constitute  persecution.
         Equally, if there remained a practice of torturing those  detained,
         I very much doubt whether a finding of  persecution  on  Convention
         grounds would be precluded merely because the torture was  intended
         to discourage terrorism or to persuade detainees to inform on their
         associates rather than inflicted for purposes of oppression".

125. When we consider the purpose of the arrests in Iran, we are left in  no
    doubt that it is to intimidate Christians and to try and  prevent  them
    from practising their faith through attendance at house churches. It is
    a purpose pursued with  malignancy,  and  with  no  legitimate  purpose
    recognised in international law.   In  that  context,  such  short-term
    arbitrary arrests must amount to persecution.


126. That this is  so  becomes  even  more  apparent  when  we  examine  the
    evidence in detail. Two important matters arise.

127. The first is that there is an ever-present fear of  ill-treatment.   We
    accept that detainees are routinely threatened  and  intimidated.  This
    psychological pressure will include the threat of physical harm to  the
    individual or his loved ones and the threat of prosecution  on  serious
    charges up to and including apostasy.  We are quite satisfied that  the
    average Iranian Christian held in detention will know someone, or  know
    of someone, for whom these threats have been realised. We have no doubt
    that for the genuine adherent this situation is extremely frightening.

128. It is in that context that the detainee is then presented with a  piece
    of paper and asked to sign it. Mr Payne suggested that  being  required
    to sign a piece of paper could  not  rationally  be  considered  to  be
    persecution. That may be so, but where the document in question amounts
    to a promise to desist from practising one's faith, it plainly  engages
    the Refugee Convention.    The detained Christian is faced with a stark
    choice: renounce your right to freedom of  conscience  and  belief,  or
    refuse to sign, and face prolonged detention and torture.  As Sir  John
    Dyson put it in HJ  (Iran)(FC)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2010] UKSC 31 [at �110], he would by signing "surrender the
    very protection that the Convention is intended to secure him".

129. These short-term disruptive detentions lie somewhere in the  middle  of
    the spectrum of measures employed by the Iranian state. Below them  lie
    the pervasive breaches of Hathaway's third and fourth tier rights which
    we have not considered necessary to enumerate in our discussion of  the
    evidence, e.g. discrimination in the workplace,  hostility  in  society
    generally, the fact that your children  will  be  educated  as  Muslims
    whether you like it or not, the fact that you cannot be  married  -  or
    buried - according to your religious rites.  Above them are  the  clear
    and undeniable breaches of tier 1 rights comprising lengthy  detention,
    prosecution and torture.

130. Having reviewed the evidence before us we do not  accept  that  any  of
    these persecutory measures are reserved exclusively for church  leaders
    or for those  with  a  particularly  evangelical  zeal.   We  think  it
    unlikely that many of those subject  to  disruptive  detention  have  a
    special role to play in their house church. Were that the case we would
    expect to see a lot more evidence than there is of people  refusing  to
    sign undertakings and facing the consequences.  As  for  the  cases  of
    longer detention and prosecution we accept that the global  figures  we
    are given may not be  entirely  accurate.  There  may  be  some  double
    counting and there are almost certainly incidents which go  unrecorded.
    What we do find to be reliable, however, are those cases documented  in
    detail by organisations such as Article 18. We accept that it is in the
    interests of such groups to ensure that their  reporting  is  accurate,
    and they are often able to give  particulars  such  as  the  detainee's
    name, age, gender, circumstances of arrest and charge. When we look  to
    this evidence we find that very many of those cases appear  to  concern
    'ordinary' Christians doing no more  than  spending  time  collectively
    with co-religionists.

131. It follows from what we have said that we were assisted not at  all  by
    the Secretary of State's attempt to reduce the task before us to a bald
    probability calculation.   Mr Payne repeatedly invited us to find  that
    even accepting the increased arrest figures, the evidence  showed  that
    only a small proportion of the 10,000-50,000 Christian converts  agreed
    to currently be in Iran have experienced serious harm.  We accept  that
    this might  be  the  case.   Having  considered  the  totality  of  the
    evidence, however, we are satisfied that  those  who  have  managed  to
    avoid such harms have done so because  of  the  extraordinary  measures
    that they routinely take to protect themselves and their  families.  To
    put it another way, we are in no doubt that if  all  of  the  Christian
    converts in Iran  openly  declared  themselves  to  be  Christian,  the
    Iranian security services would be very busy.    The  fact  that  these
    people are existing 'under the radar' does not  change  the  fact  that
    they would be persecuted if they chose to live openly.

132. At paragraph 82 of HJ (Iran) Lord Rodger  set  out  the  framework  for
    enquiry to be applied to claims based on sexual  orientation.  We  need
    only swap the word "gay" for "Christian" to  see  where  that  analysis
    leads us:

         "When an applicant applies for asylum on  the  ground  of  a  well-
         founded fear of persecution because he is gay,  the  tribunal  must
         first ask itself whether it is satisfied on the evidence that he is
         gay or that he would be treated as gay by potential persecutors  in
         his country of nationality.


         If so, the tribunal must then ask itself whether it is satisfied on
         the available evidence that gay people who lived  openly  would  be
         liable to persecution in the applicant's country of nationality.


         If so, the tribunal must go on  to  consider  what  the  individual
         applicant would do if he were returned to  that  country.   If  the
         applicant would in fact live openly and thereby  be  exposed  to  a
         real risk of persecution,  then  he  has  a  well-founded  fear  of
         persecution  -  even  if  he  could  avoid  the  risk   by   living
         "discreetly".  If, on the other hand, the tribunal  concludes  that
         the  applicant  would  in  fact  live  discreetly  and   so   avoid
         persecution, it must go on to ask itself why he would do so..."

133. We interpolate that the next section can be directly applied  to  those
    Christians who choose, for reasons unrelated to the risk  of  harm,  to
    contain their faith within the four walls of their own home:


         "...If the tribunal concludes that the applicant  would  choose  to
         live discreetly simply because that was how he himself  would  wish
         to live, or because of  social  pressures,  e  g,  not  wanting  to
         distress his parents or embarrass his friends, then his application
         should be rejected. Social pressures of that kind do not amount  to
         persecution and the Convention does not  offer  protection  against
         them. Such  a  person  has  no  well-founded  fear  of  persecution
         because, for reasons that have nothing  to  do  with  any  fear  of
         persecution, he himself chooses to adopt a way of life which  means
         that he is not in fact liable to be persecuted because he is  gay."




134. It is the final test in Lord Rodger's framework  that  we  find  to  be
    determinative in the case of Christians  who  openly  worship  in  this
    country, and who would wish to continue to do so in Iran but for  their
    well-founded fear of persecution:

         "If, on the other hand, the  tribunal  concludes  that  a  material
         reason for the applicant living discreetly on his return would be a
         fear of the persecution which would  follow  if  he  were  to  live
         openly  as  a  gay  man,  then,  other  things  being  equal,   his
         application should be accepted. Such a person  has  a  well-founded
         fear of persecution. To reject his application on the  ground  that
         he could avoid the persecution by living  discreetly  would  be  to
         defeat the very right which the Convention exists to protect -  his
         right to live freely and openly  as  a  gay  man  without  fear  of
         persecution. By admitting him to asylum and allowing  him  to  live
         freely and openly as a gay man without  fear  of  persecution,  the
         receiving state  gives  effect  to  that  right  by  affording  the
         applicant a surrogate for the protection from persecution which his
         country of nationality should have afforded him".


135. We make it clear that in reaching our findings we have considered,  and
    rejected, Mr Payne's argument for the Secretary of State that  the  act
    of collective worship does not go to the core of what it  is  to  be  a
    Christian. He cautioned us against extending protection where it is not
    needed, and urged upon us Lord  Hope's  caveat  to  the  principles  in
    HJ(Iran) [at �35(c)]:


         "On the other hand, the fact that the applicant will not be able to
         do in the country of his nationality  everything  that  he  can  do
         openly in the country whose protection he seeks is not the test. As
         I said earlier (see para 15), the Convention was  not  directed  to
         reforming the level of rights in the country of origin. So it would
         be wrong to approach the issue on the basis that the purpose of the
         Convention is to guarantee to an applicant who is gay that  he  can
         live as freely and as openly as a gay person as he would be able to
         do if he were not returned. It does not guarantee to  everyone  the
         human rights standards that are applied by  the  receiving  country
         within its own territory. The focus throughout must be on what will
         happen in the country of origin".


136. In this regard Mr Payne sought to equate the desire  of  a  convert  to
    attend a house church with that of a homosexual man wanting to go on  a
    gay rights march, this being an example given  by  Lord  Rodger  in  HJ
    (Iran) of a matter at the margins of the right [at �72].


137. We do  not  find  the  analogy  to  be  apposite.   Setting  aside  any
    theological debate that might be had about whether  collective  worship
    is a formal requirement of Christianity, it is a fact that for the vast
    majority of Christians it is an integral element of their faith. We are
    satisfied that for these people congregating to pray and worship  forms
    part of the irreducible core of what it is to be a Christian: it cannot
    be regarded as being on the margins of the protected right.  That  this
    is so is reflected by Article 10 of Council Directive  2004/83/EC  (the
    Directive):

             "1(b)     The concept of religion shall in particular  include
             the holding of theistic, non-theistic and  atheistic  beliefs,
             the participation in, or abstention from,  formal  worship  in
             private or in  public,  either  alone  or  in  community  with
             others, other religious acts or expressions of view, or  forms
             of personal or communal conduct based on or  mandated  by  any
             religious belief."

138.  See further Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights:

           "1.   Everyone has the right to freedom of  thought,  conscience
             and religion;  this  right  includes  freedom  to  change  his
             religion or belief in freedom, either alone  or  in  community
             with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion
             or belief, in worship, teaching, practice, and observance.

           2.    Freedom to manifest one's religion  or  beliefs  shall  be
             subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law  and
             are necessary in a democratic  society  in  the  interests  of
             public safety, for the protection of public order,  health  or
             morals, or for the protection of the rights  and  freedoms  of
             others."


139. We are satisfied that the  effective  ban  on  collective  worship  for
    Christian converts amounts to a severe violation of religious  freedom,
    and that the harms that Christians suffer  in  pursuit  of  that  right
    reach the high threshold of persecution. Our  conclusion  accords  with
    the Secretary of State's view expressed at �20 of the 'refusal  letter'
    issued to PS: "it is accepted that the situation for Christians in Iran
    is extremely dangerous".


140. Our conclusion in respect of disingenuous 'Christian' claimants is  set
    out under the heading 'risk on return'.  Whilst  we  accept  that  such
    returnees will likely be subject to further questioning on arrival,  we
    do not find that it will, in general, take very  long  or  entail  ill-
    treatment.  It is the widespread practice of the Iranian authorities to
    detain a suspected Christian for a short period and require him to sign
    an undertaking which amongst other things will require him to  renounce
    Christianity and formally  accept  Islam.  There  being  no  reason  of
    conscience for the disingenuous claimant to refuse to do so, he will be
    released quickly. He may be  subject  to  surveillance  but  will  not,
    absent any other relevant  factors,  be  exposed  to  a  real  risk  of
    persecution thereafter. Whether there are aggravating factors such that
    a real risk of harm may arise at port will  depend  on  the  individual
    case.


    Country Guidance

141. This country guidance applies to protection claims  from  Iranians  who
    claim to have converted from Islam to Christianity.


142.  Insofar  as  they  relate  to  non-ethnic  Christians,  this  decision
    replaces the country guidance  decisions  in  FS  and  Others  (Iran  -
    Christian  Converts)  Iran  CG  [2004]  UKIAT  00303  and  SZ  and   JM
    (Christians - FS confirmed) Iran CG [2008] UKAIT  00082  which  are  no
    longer to be followed.

143. Decision makers should begin by determining whether  the  claimant  has
    demonstrated that  it  is  reasonably  likely  that  he  or  she  is  a
    Christian.  If that burden is discharged the  following  considerations
    apply:

              i) A convert to Christianity seeking to openly  practice  that
                 faith in Iran would face a real risk of persecution.


             ii) If the claimant would in fact conceal his faith,  decision-
                 makers should consider why.  If any part of the  claimant's
                 motivation is a fear of such persecution, the appeal should
                 be allowed.


            iii) If the claimant would choose to conceal  his  faith  purely
                 for other reasons  (family  pressure,  social  constraints,
                 personal preference etc) then protection should be refused.
                 The  evidence  demonstrates  that  private   and   solitary
                 worship, within the confines of the home, is  possible  and
                 would not in general entail a real risk of persecution.

144. In cases where the claimant is found to be  insincere  in  his  or  her
    claimed conversion, there is  not  a  real  risk  of  persecution  'in-
    country'. There being no reason for such  an  individual  to  associate
    himself with Christians, there is not a real risk that he would come to
    the adverse attention of the Iranian authorities. Decision-makers  must
    nevertheless consider the possible risks arising at the  'pinch  point'
    of arrival:


              i) All returning failed asylum seekers are subject to
                 questioning on arrival, and this will include questions
                 about why they claimed asylum;


             ii) A returnee who divulges that he claimed to be a Christian
                 is reasonably likely to be transferred for further
                 questioning;


            iii) The returnee can be expected to sign an undertaking
                 renouncing his claimed Christianity. The questioning will
                 therefore in general be short and will not entail a real
                 risk of ill-treatment;


             iv) If there are any reasons why the detention becomes
                 prolonged, the risk of ill-treatment will correspondingly
                 rise. Factors that could result in prolonged detention must
                 be determined on a case by case basis. They could include
                 but are not limited to:

                      a) Previous adverse contact with the Iranian security
                         services;


                      b) Connection to persons of interest to  the  Iranian
                         authorities;


                      c) Attendance at a church with  perceived  connection
                         to Iranian house churches;


                      d) Overt social media  content  indicating  that  the
                         individual   concerned   has   actively   promoted
                         Christianity.




    The Appeal of PS


    The Accepted Evidence


145. The Appellant PS arrived in the United  Kingdom  in  January  2013.  He
    claimed asylum but by April of that year the First-tier Tribunal (Judge
    Shanahan) had dismissed the appeal that had apparently been advanced on
    two discrete grounds  -  fear  of  persecution  for  imputed  political
    opinion arising out of the  Appellant's  inadvertent  attendance  at  a
    'green movement' protest in 2009, and fear  of  honour  based  violence
    relating from his desire  to  marry  his  girlfriend.   Judge  Shanahan
    disbelieved both claims and by June  2013  the  Appellant  was  'appeal
    rights exhausted' and living in the Wigan area.


146. In December 2014 he was arrested for  affray  and  spent  approximately
    five months in prison. He states that  he  attended  chapel  whilst  in
    prison and that he was counselled by the chaplain.


147.  In  mid-May  2015  the  Appellant  started  attending  the   Coverdale
    Christian Church in Manchester.  Two weeks later he had been  baptised.
    In December 2015 he made a  'fresh  claim'  for  asylum  based  on  his
    claimed conversion.


148. The Respondent refused to grant protection. The haste  of  the  baptism
    and the Appellant's lack of knowledge gave rise to a finding that  this
    was not a genuine conversion. The Appellant appealed and in  July  2017
    his appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal for a second time.


149. The First-tier Tribunal (Judge EMM Smith) accepted that  the  Appellant
    had for a period in 2015-2016 attended the Coverdale Christian  Church.
    The Tribunal further accepted the bona  fides  of  a  Dorodian  witness
    (Pastor Carr-Brown) but found his decision  to  baptise  the  Appellant
    after only knowing him two weeks to be "na�ve".  Some months before the
    hearing the Appellant had been moved away from  the  area  and  so  had
    stopped regularly attending church. Pastor Carr-Brown had himself  been
    seriously ill and so had been away from work.  No  one  else  from  the
    church came forward to say that the Appellant had maintained connection
    with the church in this period.   There  was  no  evidence  before  the
    Tribunal that  the  Appellant  had  attended  any  other  church.   The
    Tribunal concluded that the Appellant had become "disengaged", and that
    his participation in Christian activities in the period  between  2015-
    2016 had been nothing more than a 'charade'.


    Findings and Disposal


150. PS does not have a passport. In order to be returned to  Iran  he  will
    need to obtain an emergency travel document from the embassy in London.
    The Iranian government will therefore be aware that he is an individual
    who has been in the United Kingdom without leave. We accept  that  they
    will know that he is a failed asylum seeker.  On  arrival  PS  will  be
    questioned.  We accept we cannot know what PS will tell  them  but  for
    the purpose of this appeal we accept that it will come to light that PS
    claimed asylum on the basis that he has converted to  Christianity.  PS
    will be transferred for second-line questioning.


151. The officer conducting that questioning will  find  out  the  following
    information. PS has been out of Iran since 2013; he has claimed  asylum
    on at least two occasions, variously asserting  fear  as  a  result  of
    being caught up in the green movement protests, 'honour' based violence
    and latterly on the basis that he had  converted  to  Christianity;  he
    attended church between May 2015 and sometime in 2016 and was  baptised
    after he had been going to that church for about two weeks; he  has  no
    known contact with the authorities prior to leaving  Iran;  he  has  no
    known connection with any persons of interest, nor any  adverse  social
    media content to be concerned about. He has no  known  connection  with
    any organisation which could be connected by the Iranian government  to
    the house church movement.  He may be  asked  to  sign  an  undertaking
    promising that he will not undertake any Christian activities. There is
    no reason why PS would refuse. We find that he is likely to  be  judged
    to present a negligible risk to  the  security  of  Iran.  He  will  be
    released fairly quickly and we are not satisfied that there is any risk
    of ill-treatment.  PS  may  be  placed  under  surveillance.  Once  the
    authorities are satisfied that he is  not  attending  house  church  or
    attempting to contact  known  Christians  he  will  be  of  no  further
    interest to the authorities.  Accordingly, we find  that  PS  does  not
    face a real risk of persecution upon return to Iran and his  appeal  is
    dismissed.
