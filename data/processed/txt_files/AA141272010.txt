Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Duncan, Solicitor, Duncan Moghal Solicitors and
Advocates     (Newport)
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1. The appellant, a citizen of the Ivory Coast born  on  14  December  1965,
claimed asylum on arrival in the UK in  April  2008.   When  the  respondent
refused her claim in  2010  she  appealed.  In  November  2010.   First-tier
Tribunal Judge Woolley dismissed her appeal.  Subsequently,  upon  grant  of
permission, her case came before  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Grubb  who,  in  a
determination sent on 28 November 2011, found that  Judge  Woolley  had  not
erred in law.  That prompted an application for permission to appeal to  the
Court of Appeal which was eventually  granted  by  Sir  Stephen  Sedley  and
resulted in a consent order of 24 January 2013 remitting the matter  to  the
Upper Tribunal.   In  the  Statement  of  Reasons  it  is  stated  that  the
respondent accepts that the Upper Tribunal materially erred in  law  in  its
consideration of the country guidance  determination  in  MD  (Women)  Ivory
Coast CG [2010] UKUT 215 (IAC) by finding  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
failure to recognise the appellant as a member of a particular social  group
was immaterial to the finding as  to  whether  the  appellant  could  safely
relocate within the Ivory Coast.  The statement concluded:-

         "The parties are in agreement that this matter should  be  remitted
         to the Upper Tribunal for consideration to be given to whether  the
         Appellant, as a Member of a Particular  Social  Group,  can  safely
         internally relocate within the Ivory Coast without undue  hardship,
         having regard to the Appellant's particular circumstances  and  the
         conditions prevailing in the area to which relocation is proposed".

2. In the grant of permission Sir Stephen Sedley had drawn attention to  the
"Shah and Islam risk facing [the appellant] and women like her in the  Ivory
Coast" and stated that "[t]he  relationship  between  the  character  of  an
established risk of sexual violence and safety by relocation is  a  question
of general importance."

3. Following discussion with the parties I ruled, with their  consent,  that
given the terms  on  which  the  appeal  had  been  remitted  to  the  Upper
Tribunal, my starting point should be that  it  is  accepted  that  (1)  the
appellant experienced persecution in her home area of Abidjan in  July  2010
when she was the victim of an attack in the course of which  she  was  raped
and her father killed; (2) she  had  a  well-founded  fear  of  experiencing
persecution again at the hands of the same perpetrators in  her  home  area;
and (3) she is a member of a particular  social  group,  namely  women.   Mr
Duncan submitted that  in  the  light  of  Sir  Stephen  Sedley's  grant  of
permission I should also treat as a starting point that (4)  the  attack  on
the appellant in July 2010 was carried out by state actors, namely  soldiers
of the government (members of the Forces of C�te d'Ivoire (FRCI)), and  they
should not be classified (as they  had  been  by  Judge  Woolley)  as  rogue
elements.  Mr Richards did not seek to argue against that and accordingly  I
shall approach the appellant's case on the  basis  of  (1)-(4)  above.   The
essential question to be asked is whether the appellant has a viable  option
of internal relocation.

4. I heard submissions from the parties.

5. Mr Duncan submitted that in  relation  to  internal  relocation  and  the
"safety" limb, the appellant would still face a risk of further  persecution
because the soldiers who attacked her would still have access to  the  state
infrastructure and its intelligence systems  and  would  have  a  continuing
interest in tracking her down so  as  to  ensure  she  could  not  become  a
witness  against  them  for  crimes  of  impunity.   Because  she  would  be
relocating from an urban to a rural setting  and  as  a  single  woman,  she
would stand out.  So as to avoid the errors  of  the  First-tier  and  Upper
Tribunal judges who dealt with  the  appellant's  case  previously,  it  was
necessary to look at the issue of her safety  holistically  so  as  to  take
account of the fact that she had been active in  her  local  branch  of  the
RDR, had been detained twice for her RDR activities, was a Muslim  from  the
North, of immigrant stock and was also a woman and as such, in  the  context
of the Ivory Coast, a member of a particular social group, namely  women  of
that country.

6. In relation to the  "reasonableness"  limb  of  the  internal  relocation
test, Mr Duncan submitted that the appellant was a person who had  been  the
victim of rape at the hands of the authorities and her  experience  had  not
only left her with physical but also mental scars.   Furthermore  there  was
recent  medical  evidence  to  show  that  her  medical  circumstances   had
worsened.  In this context also, the fact that she was a  Muslim,  from  the
North,  of  immigrant  stock  and  a  woman  would   increase   the   likely
difficulties she would face.

7.  Mr  Richards  submitted  that  the  case  law   and   recent   political
developments  up  to  the  date  of  hearing  before  me,  was  against  the
appellant.  Her political profile was low, she had only  been  active  at  a
local level.  Even assuming the soldiers who raped her  before  were  likely
to act again with impunity they would have no incentive to go 200 miles  for
that purpose, they could do that against women in their own area.  The  case
of MD accepted that internal relocation was possible  even  for  women.   On
the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal she had family in  Bouake  where
she herself had lived until she was 16/17.  The  medical  evidence  did  not
establish she could not live a normal life in Bouake.

8. At this point Mr Duncan intervened to say that there was  evidence  which
had been  placed  before  the  Secretary  of  State  establishing  that  the
appellant was currently unfit to travel even more than a mile in the UK  and
had only attended today because she had been refused an adjournment and  the
Welsh Refugee Council were accompanying  her.   He  identified  two  medical
appointment cards and a pr�cis of the appellant's  current  health  problems
as prepared by the Welsh Refugee  Council.   I  informed  the  parties  that
unless they objected I would wait until the end of the day for Mr Duncan  to
fax the documents to which he referred, as these could  not  immediately  be
located in the file.  Before the end of the  day  I  received  a  number  of
items of correspondence confirming that in November 2012 the  appellant  was
involved in a road traffic incident and has been attending  appointments  at
a Pain Clinic for chronic pain, at  Hospital  Orthopaedic  and  Neurosurgery
departments, and is also in psychiatric care after an attempted  suicide  in
July 2013.  On 29 April her GP stated  that  she  was  currently  unable  to
leave her flat without the assistance of at least one other person  and  she
has no family in the area to help her leave her  house.   On  18  July  2013
UKBA waived her reporting  condition  requesting  her  to  sign  at  Cardiff
Reporting Centre.   She  has  assistance  currently  of  the  Welsh  Refugee
Council with attending appointments.


My Assessment
9. Errors of law on the part of the First-tier (and  Upper  Tribunal)  Judge
having been identified by the Court of Appeal, my task in this appeal is  to
re-make the decision.  As already explained I take as my starting  point  in
this appeal that the appellant had been targeted for  persecution  by  state
actors who had brutally raped  her  and  targeted  her  on  account  of  her
membership of a particular social group.

10. In approaching the issue of relocation I bear in mind that Article 8  of
the Qualification Directive provides that:
    "1.  As part of the assessment of the  application  for  international
    protection, Member States may determine that an  applicant  is  not  in
    need of international protection if in a part of the country of  origin
    there is no well-founded fear of being persecuted or no  real  risk  of
    suffering serious harm and the applicant can reasonably be expected  to
    stay in that part of the country.
    2.  In examining whether a  part  of  the  country  of  origin  is  in
    accordance with paragraph 1, Member States shall at the time of  taking
    the  decision  on  the  application  have   regard   to   the   general
    circumstances prevailing in  that  part  of  the  country  and  to  the
    personal circumstances of the applicant."
          and that in consequence there is a two-limbed test of  (a)  safety
(well founded fear of being persecuted) and reasonableness and that even  if
someone is considered to be safe in another part of the  country,  they  can
still succeed in a  claim  for  international  protection  if  it  would  be
unreasonable to expect them to stay there. It is  also  essential  that  the
other party of the country be accessible.

11. As regards "safety", I do not consider that  the  evidence  demonstrates
that the appellant will  face  any  further  risk  of  persecution  or  ill-
treatment from state or non-state actors, whether  the  individual  soldiers
who raped her previously or anyone else.  Although she had in the past  been
detained for her political activities, the last occasion was in 2004 and  as
a result of the  political  changes  that  have  taken  place  in  the  Cote
d'Ivoire, former president Gbagbo's political  party,  the  Ivorian  Popular
Front (FPI)  is no longer in  power.   Her  own  party,  the  Rally  of  the
Republicans  (Rassemblement  des  R�publicains,  RDR)   is   presently   the
country's governing party; the party's  leader,  Alassane  Ouattara  is  the
current  President. No doubt because he was alive to the  changed  political
situation, Mr Duncan put his argument  concerning  lack  of  safety  on  the
footing that the soldiers who raped the appellant  in  2010  (even  assuming
their own position had been unaffected by  the  toppling  of  Gbagbo)  would
continue to have an interest in tracking down the appellant  to  ensure  she
could not emerge as a witness  against  them  for  their  acts  of  impunity
against her in 2010, but  there  is  no  evidence  to  indicate  that  these
soldiers would come to learn of her return or, even if they did,  that  they
would have any real concern about her  being  a  potential  witness  against
them.  This was pure speculation on  Mr  Duncan's  part  and  I  reject  it.
Nothing in the background country evidence indicated that soldiers  who  had
committed criminal acts against women or low-level political  oppositionists
in 2010 would now face being prosecuted.  Indeed, as Mr Duncan himself  drew
attention to,  the  US  State  Department  report  for  2013  indicated,  if
anything, that  the  climate  of  impunity  remained,  notwithstanding  that
Gbagbo and his party were no longer in  power.  Eighteen  months  after  the
post-election crisis, only people associated with former President  Gbagbo's
government had been arrested. No members of  the  former  Forces  Nouvelles,
nor any military  officials  or  civilians  responsible  for  serious  human
rights abuses supporting President Ouattara, had been  brought  to  account.
In  that  context  I  concur  with  Mr  Richards  in  considering  that  the
individual soldiers who had acted with impunity  against  the  appellant  in
2010 would not have any interest in travelling 200 miles to  commit  further
acts of sexual violence which they could carry out in their home area.

12. The background evidence contains no suggestion that the FCPI would  hold
lists of low-level  members  of  the  RDR  in  whom  the  previous,  ousted,
government of Gbagbo had an adverse interest.   Nor  is  there  anything  to
indicate that the fact of the appellant being a Muslim, from the  North  and
of immigrant stock,  would  give  rise  to  any  real  risk  that  her  past
persecutors or other state actors would seek to pursue  her  in  Bouake.  In
the Ivory Coast as a whole,  women  face  a  range  of  discriminations  and
harassment is widespread but  the  evidence  does  not  indicate  that  such
difficulties are sufficiently severe to mean that women per se face  a  real
risk of persecution or ill treatment.

13. As regards the "reasonableness" limb of the internal relocation test,  I
do not  consider  that  the  appellant's  circumstances,  even  when  viewed
cumulatively in conformity with Article  8(2),  would  give  rise  to  undue
hardship.   Indeed,  it  would  appear  that   in   certain   respects   her
circumstances in Bouake would be more amenable to her than those  she  faced
in the capital.  Bouake was the area where she had  grown  up  and  had  her
family origins.  It was where one of her sisters lived; it was in the  North
of the country so she would not face any ant-Northern sentiment; it  was  an
area where many Muslims lived (although Muslims  only  comprise  2%  of  the
total population the main base  of  the  Muslim  majority  from  the  Dioula
people is Bouake;  Bouake is  an  area  where  she  had  lived  without  any
significant problems and so it would not remind her of  the  trauma  of  her
past experiences as  might  a  return  to  live  in  the  capital.  For  the
avoidance of doubt I do not accept that the appellant would not be  able  to
receive family support  in  Bouake.  The  appellant  has  been  involved  in
employment previously and has a university degree, so would not be  confined
(in the longer term) to  obtaining  work  in  the  low-paid  sector  of  the
economy.

14. Mr Duncan has submitted that the appellant's ability to live  reasonably
in Bouake would be significantly impeded by her health problems.  So far  as
concerns her medical problems arising from the 2010 incident, she was  found
by Dr Gibson in his medico-legal report of July 2010 to suffer  from  severe
back pain, difficulties in walking, problems with eating and chewing,  lower
abdominal pain, sleeplessness, flashbacks,  depression,  symptoms  of  post-
traumatic stress disorder  and  depression.   It  was  also  noted  she  had
considered suicide.

15. However, the same report also noted that  she  was  able  to  walk  with
crutches and her GP had already started her on  appropriate  medication  and
referred her  for  counselling.   Despite  the  Tribunal  giving  directions
requesting any further evidence relied on to be produced, there has been  no
further medical report nor country information evidence relating  to  access
to medical facilities in the Ivory Coast.  There was no evidence before  the
Tribunal previously nor presently to suggest that in respect of her  medical
condition she would not be any less able to manage in Bouake than in the  UK
and, indeed, one of her psychological symptoms  noted  in  2010,  alienation
from the rest of (UK) society (see page 36 of  the  report),  would  clearly
not apply in the area where she had family and grown up.

16.  Mr  Duncan  has  adduced  further  evidence  in  connection   with   an
application for an  adjournment  (which  was  previously  rejected  and  not
renewed before me).  Albeit late, I take it into  account.   It  shows  that
the appellant had a traffic accident in late 2012 which has  compounded  her
previous  problems.   It  also   establishes   that   she   has   continuing
psychological  difficulties.   However,  it  does  not  indicate  that   her
physical and psychological difficulties would prevent her  from  being  able
to live in Bouake where (unlike her situation in  the  UK)  she  would  have
family to help her.  So far as concerns her psychological problems, none  of
this new evidence indicates that  these  are  likely  to  be  aggravated  by
return to an area of Ivory Coast away from any danger.  Indeed the  evidence
indicates that return to an area where she has family ties  would  mean  she
would no longer feel isolated and alienated from surrounding society.

17. Given the high threshold set  by  established  cases  relating  to  ill-
health cases, it is plain that the  appellant's  health  circumstances  come
nowhere near establishing any real risk of ill-treatment - or indeed of  any
violation of her Article 8 right to physical and moral integrity.  I  should
emphasise that in reaching my decision I bear in  mind  that  the  appellant
currently requires a Zimmer frame and/or  crutches  to  walk  and  that  she
needs help from others to travel.  In my  judgment  she  would  be  able  to
arrange for such help to be available to assist her journey  to  Bouake  and
once there, the state of the evidence satisfies me should be  able  to  rely
on family support.

18. The background evidence continues to indicate that in  the  Ivory  Coast
women face discrimination and a background risk of sexual violence, but  the
appellant's own circumstances, the fact that she has a university  education
and a history of work in large companies, indicates  that  she  is  used  to
engagement with the outside world would be able to live  in  Bouake  without
such  discrimination  and  background  risk  causing  her  any   significant
detriment.

19. Whilst the appellant's medical problems may make it more difficult  than
when she was in the Ivory Coast previously to find employment - and  in  the
short-term because of her accident employment is not a  realistic  option  -
the fact that she has family roots (and at  least  one  sister)  in  Bouake,
means that there is no reason to think she would face destitution.

20. For the above reasons I conclude that the appellant has a viable  option
of internal relocation in the Ivory Coast and further, that it would not  be
a breach of her human rights to return her to the Ivory Coast.  Hence:






     -   the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in law

     -   the decision I re-make is to dismiss the appellant's appeal.
