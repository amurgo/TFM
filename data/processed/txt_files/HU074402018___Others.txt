Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
Anonymity was granted at an earlier stage of  the  proceedings  because  the
case initially involved child welfare issues and protection issues.  I  find
that it is appropriate to continue the order. Unless and  until  a  tribunal
or court directs otherwise, the appellants are granted anonymity. No  report
of these proceedings shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  him  or  any
member of his family. This direction applies both to the  appellant  and  to
the respondent.


Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms L. Mair, instructed by ASR Legal Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms S. Cunha, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appellants are a family comprising of  mother  (AB),  father  (VB)
    and two daughters (IB and AKB). IB's case forms part of the same linked
    appeals but it was agreed before the First-tier Tribunal that her  case
    involved confidential issues which should be dealt with in  a  separate
    decision (IA/00225/2017). I have decided that it is now appropriate  to
    deal with all the cases in a single decision. It is not  necessary  for
    the purpose of this decision to  go  into  the  sensitive  issues  that
    justified a separate decision in relation to the case of IB.

2.    The background to the case is summarised in my earlier  error  of  law
    decision relating to AB, VB and AKB (annexed). There has been a  series
    of directions and further case management following the  start  of  the
    Covid-19 pandemic. It is  not  necessary  to  set  out  the  procedural
    history save to say that during the course  of  these  proceedings  the
    appellants' situation has changed. At  the  hearing  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal on 09 March 2021 the parties  are  now  in  agreement  on  the
    following matters:

       i) Whether or not the Upper Tribunal is bound by  section  85(5)  of
          the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  ('NIAA  2002')
          the respondent gives consent for the current circumstances to  be
          considered:  Birch  (Precariousness  and  mistake;  new  matters)
          [2020] UKUT 86 referred.


      ii) If the appellants applied for leave to remain at the date of  the
          hearing, it is  accepted  that  they  meet  the  requirements  of
          paragraph 276B  of  the  immigration  rules  ('continuous  lawful
          residence'). All four have 10 years continuous lawful  residence,
          there are no public interest considerations, and  they  meet  the
          requirements of Appendix KoLL. It  is  agreed  that  the  appeals
          should be allowed  on  human  rights  grounds  in  light  of  the
          decision in OA &  Others  (human  rights;  'new  matter';  s.120)
          Nigeria [2019] UKUT 65.

     iii) In the case  of  AKB,  she  met  the  requirements  of  paragraph
          276ADE(1)(iv) of the immigration rules ('unreasonable  to  expect
          the child to leave the UK') at the date of  the  application.  At
          the date of the hearing,  she  also  meets  the  requirements  of
          paragraph 276ADE(1)(v) ('18-25 years  and  spent  half  her  life
          living in the UK'). In any event, the respondent accepts that  it
          would be disproportionate to remove her in all the  circumstances
          of the case.

      iv) In the case of IB,  the  respondent  does  not  accept  that  her
          circumstances  would   meet   the   requirements   of   paragraph
          276ADE(1)(vi)  of  the  immigration  rules   ('very   significant
          obstacles to integration'). The appellant does not seek to pursue
          the point in light of the respondent's other concessions. In  any
          event, the respondent accepts that it would  be  disproportionate
          to remove her in all the circumstances of the case.

3.    In light of the agreement between the  parties  I  conclude  that  the
    appellants' removal in consequence of the decision  would  be  unlawful
    under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.


DECISION

The appeals are ALLOWED on human rights grounds

Representation:
For the appellants:    Mr Z. Jafferji, instructed by Lawfare Solicitors

Solicitors Ltd
For the respondent:    Mr E. Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appellants are a family comprising of  mother  (AB),  father  (VB)
    and two daughters (IB and AKB). IB's case forms part of the same linked
    appeals but it was agreed before the First-tier Tribunal that her  case
    involved confidential issues which should be dealt with in  a  separate
    decision (IA/00225/2017).

Decisions dated 22 December 2016 (the whole family)

2.    AB ("the appellant") is the main applicant who entered the  UK  on  20
    November 2009 with entry  clearance  as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
    Migrant that was valid until 30 July 2012.  Her  leave  to  remain  was
    extended in the same category until 07 June 2014. On 05 April 2013  the
    appellant applied for leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    Migrant. She was interviewed on 11 March 2016.

3.    The respondent refused leave to remain  as  a  Tier  1  Migrant  in  a
    decision dated 22 December 2016.  The  other  appellants  were  refused
    leave to remain as her dependents. The decision that is the subject  of
    the appeal was a decision to refuse leave to remain as a Tier 1 Migrant
    and did not include a decision to refuse a human rights claim.

Decision dated 12 March 2018 (AKB)

4.    On 24 January 2018 the appellant's  daughter  (AKB)  made  a  separate
    application  for  leave  to  remain  on  human  rights   grounds.   The
    application was  refused  in  a  decision  dated  12  March  2018.  The
    respondent  concluded  that  she  did  not  meet   the   private   life
    requirements of  paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv)  of  the  immigration  rules.
    Although the respondent accepted that she had lived in  the  UK  for  a
    continuous period of seven years, having entered in November  2010,  it
    was reasonable to expect her to leave the UK with her family who had no
    basis of stay in the UK.  Her appeal against the respondent's  decision
    to refuse a  human  rights  claim  (HU/07440/2018)  is  linked  to  the
    original appeal in which she is also an appellant (IA/00226/2017).

First-tier Tribunal decision

5.    First-tier Tribunal Judge  S.H.  Smith  ("the  judge")  dismissed  the
    appeals in two separate decisions promulgated on  10  April  2019.  The
    first decision dealt with the applications made by the whole family and
    included a decision in respect of AKB's human rights claim. The  second
    decision dealt with discreet issues arising from  human  rights  issues
    raised for the first time at the hearing by IB.  In  this  decision,  I
    will only  deal  with  the  judge's  findings  relating  to  the  first
    decision. Consistent with Judge Smith's approach, I will deal with  the
    issues relating to IB in a separate decision.

6.    The judge noted that  the  appellant  did  not  pursue  any  arguments
    relating to the original application for leave to remain as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  and  concluded  that  the  appellant  and  her
    dependents could not succeed on that basis under the immigration  rules
    [36-40].

7.    The  judge  went  on  to  consider  whether  he  had  jurisdiction  to
    determine human  rights  grounds  given  that  the  decision  dated  22
    December 2016 did not include a  decision  to  refuse  a  human  rights
    claim. By virtue  of  saved  provisions  relating  to  Part  5  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("NIAA 2002"), the  appeal
    was to be determined according to the provisions in  place  before  the
    changes introduced by way of amendments to Part 5  by  the  Immigration
    Act  2014  ("IA  2014").  The  first  decision  related  to  a  Tier  1
    application made before 06 April 2015: see Article 1(2)(e) and  Article
    9(b) (SI:2014/2771) (as amended SI:2015/371). The judge  was  satisfied
    that by virtue of the saved version of section 85(4) NIAA 2002  he  had
    jurisdiction to consider any matters relevant to the substance  of  the
    decision, including matters arising after  the  date  of  the  decision
    [41]. AKB's appeal was against a decision  to  refuse  a  human  rights
    claim and was to be determined with reference  to  the  amended  appeal
    framework [42].

8.    The judge was satisfied that the appellants  had  established  private
    lives in the UK and that removal in consequence of the  decision  would
    infer with their private lives in a sufficiently grave  way  to  engage
    their rights under Article 8(1) of the  European  Convention  [44].  In
    assessing whether removal would be  justified  and  proportionate,  the
    judge considered whether any of the appellants  met  the  private  life
    requirements contained in paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)  of  the  immigration
    rules. He concluded that the first and second appellants  (AB  and  VB)
    could not show that there would  be  'very  significant  obstacles'  to
    their integration in India given that they were  born  and  brought  up
    there and remained familiar with the language, culture and customs. The
    appellants had skills that they could use to re-establish themselves in
    India [47].

9.    In relation to AKB, she did not meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) at the date of the application on 24 January 2018 because
    she was not 18 years old, although she was by the date of the  hearing.
    However, having considered the concerns raised by AKB, and the evidence
    contained  in  the  independent  social  worker's  report,  the   judge
    concluded that she would  not  face  'very  significant  obstacles'  to
    integration in India because she lived there until she was 10 years old
    and her parents would be able to support her to re-integrate [48-51].

10.   The judge went on to consider whether  AKB  met  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) at the date of the application.  If  she  could
    show that it was unreasonable to expect her to  leave  the  UK  at  the
    relevant time it would be a matter that should be given weight  in  the
    balancing exercise [53].  The  judge  then  conducted  an  analysis  of
    relevant case law in  KO  (Nigeria)  v  SSHD  [2018]  UKSC  53  and  MA
    (Pakistan) & Others v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 705. The judge took  as  his
    starting point the fact that AKB's parents had no leave to  remain  and
    it would generally be reasonable to expect the child to  leave  the  UK
    with her parents [57-58]. At the time  of  the  application  return  to
    India would have disrupted AKB's A level studies, the judge found  that
    it would have been in her best interests  to  continue  to  pursue  her
    education while living with her family "in whichever country her family
    were living in [at] the time". He concluded that  her  best  interests,
    "in light of the fact her parents did not enjoy a right to reside here,
    would have been to return to India with the family, as a family  unit."
    [60]. The judge concluded that, at the  date  of  the  application,  it
    would not have been unreasonable to expect the child to  leave  the  UK
    and that she did not meet the requirements of  paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv)
    [61].

11.   The judge went on to weigh various competing  factors,  including  the
    public interest considerations contained in  section  117B  NIAA  2002,
    before concluding that the appellants' removal in  consequence  of  the
    decision would not be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights  Act
    1998 ("HRA 1998").

Grounds of appeal

12.    AKB  appeals  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  on  the  following
    grounds:

       i) The judge failed to consider the  fact  that  the  appellant  was
          under 18 years of age at the date  of  the  application  for  the
          purpose of the assessment under paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv).


      ii) The judge failed to take into account relevant considerations  in
          assessing whether it would be reasonable to expect her  to  leave
          the UK.

     iii) The judge erred in beginning his assessment from the view that it
          would generally be reasonable to expect a child to leave  the  UK
          with her parents.

      iv) The judge erred in finding that the parents  were  did  not  have
          leave to remain in the UK and were liable to removal. At the date
          of the application they were  remaining  lawfully  by  virtue  of
          section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971 ("IA 1971")  awaiting  the
          outcome of the appeal.

       v) The best interest assessment was  flawed.  The  judge  failed  to
          conduct an evaluative assessment giving appropriate weight to the
          fact that the child had been continuously resident in the UK  for
          a period of seven years.

13.   AB and VB appeal the First-tier Tribunal  decision  on  the  following
    grounds:

       i) The decision in respect of their claims was  unsustainable  as  a
          result of the flawed assessment of their daughters' claims.


      ii) It is asserted that the  judge  failed  to  conduct  an  adequate
          balancing exercise of all the factors that  were  relevant  to  a
          proper assessment of Article 8 and failed to give adequate weight
          to the respondent's delay in decision making and  further  delays
          during the appeal process.

Decision and reasons

Error of law

14.         The first point raised in the grounds has no  merit.  The  judge
    made clear at that, even if  AKB  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) at the date of the hearing because she  was  an
    adult, if he found that she met the requirements at  the  date  of  the
    application, it was a matter that would  be  given  significant  weight
    that may well be determinative of the appeal [53].

15.   The fourth point is equally unarguable. It mattered  not  whether  the
    first and second appellants were remaining in the UK  lawfully  pending
    the  outcome  of  the  appeal.  Their  immigration  status  was   still
    precarious. They did not, as  it  turned  out,  have  any  prospect  of
    success in relation to the original application  for  leave  to  remain
    under the immigration rules. Then and now  their  human  rights  claims
    rely largely on the success of their daughters' claims. It light of his
    finding  that  the  parents  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    immigration rules either in relation to  the  Tier  1  application,  or
    under the private life provisions contained in paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi),
    it was open to the judge to conclude that the  'real  world'  situation
    was one where the parents had no leave to remain and would be  expected
    to leave the UK.

16.   However, the arguments relating to the judge's analysis  of  the  best
    interests of the child (AKB) and whether she met  the  'reasonableness'
    test at the date of the application are more persuasive.  The  decision
    in KO (Nigeria) does not obviate a judge from conducting  a  structured
    approach to the assessment of the best  interests  of  a  child  before
    assessing whether it would be reasonable to expect that child to  leave
    the UK. The first assessment is needed to inform the second.

17.   The Supreme Court in ZH (Tanzania) v  SSHD  [2011]  UKSC4  made  clear
    that the best interests of a child must be considered first. They are a
    primary consideration, which must be given appropriate weight  although
    they can be  outweighed  by  the  cumulative  effect  of  other  public
    interest considerations. In Zoumbas  v  SSHD  [2013]  UKSC  74  and  EV
    (Philippines) and others v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 874 the  Supreme  Court
    and the Court of Appeal gave further guidance as to  the  factors  that
    might be relevant to the assessment. Neither ZH (Tanzania) nor  Zoumbas
    were considered by the Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria), but  are  equally
    binding.

18.   Even then, the policy that was only partially quoted in  KO  (Nigeria)
    cited at [57] of the judge's decision made clear  that  strong  reasons
    would be needed to justify refusing an application in a case  involving
    children who had been resident in the UK for  a  continuous  period  of
    seven years.

         "The requirement that a non-British Citizen child has lived in  the
         UK for a continuous period of at  least  the  7  years  immediately
         preceding the  date  of  application,  recognises  that  over  time
         children start to put down roots and integrate into life in the UK,
         to  the  extent  that  being  required  to  leave  the  UK  may  be
         unreasonable. The longer the child has resided in the UK, the  more
         the balance will begin to swing in terms of it  being  unreasonable
         to expect the child to leave the UK, and  strong  reasons  will  be
         required in order to refuse a case with continuous UK residence  of
         more than 7 years." [11.2.4]

19.   The case law relating to section 117B(6) has come full circle  to  the
    position first outlined by Elias LJ  in  MA  (Pakistan).  His  favoured
    approach was to interpret the  wording  of  section  117B(6)  to  focus
    solely on the child (albeit he went on to find that he was bound  by  a
    previous decision of  the  Court  of  Appeal  at  the  time).  What  MA
    (Pakistan) makes clear, is that the chosen threshold of seven years has
    significance. Elias LJ emphasised that the Secretary of State's  policy
    recognised that after seven years a child is likely to  have  set  down
    roots and developed social, cultural and educational links  in  the  UK
    such that it would be highly disruptive if the  child  is  required  to
    leave. This may be less  so  when  a  child  is  very  young,  but  the
    disruption becomes more serious as the child gets older. The fact  that
    a child has been resident for a period of seven years should  be  given
    "significant weight" in the balancing exercise.  He  went  on  to  say:
    "Moreover, in these cases there must be a very strong expectation  that
    the child's best interests will be to remain in the UK with his parents
    as part of a family unit, that must rank as a primary consideration  in
    the proportionality assessment."[46]

20.   The fact that the respondent's policy has changed since  then  matters
    not. The Upper Tribunal in JG (s 117B(6):  "reasonable  to  leave"  UK)
    Turkey [2019] UKUT 72 expressly rejected the argument that  changes  to
    the IDI made any difference to a proper  assessment  of  the  statutory
    wording (in that case section 117B(6)).  The  provisions  contained  in
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) or section 117B(6)  are  said  to  comply  with
    Article 8 of the European Convention and must be interpreted  according
    to the relevant principles. The statement made in the  earlier  policy,
    endorsed by the Court of Appeal in MA (Pakistan), is broadly consistent
    with the general principles relating to the weight that should be given
    to the best interest of children  outlined  in  earlier  Supreme  Court
    decisions.

21.   In this case, the judge began his assessment  with  reference  to  the
    respondent's  policy  statement  rather  than  conducting  an   initial
    assessment of the best interests of  the  child  at  the  date  of  the
    application. Although it was open to him to consider the fact that  AKB
    could continue her education in India, nowhere in his assessment did he
    give weight, let alone significant weight, to the  fact  that  she  had
    been continuously resident in the UK for a period of  seven  years.  No
    evaluative assessment was undertaken as to the  strength  of  the  ties
    that the child might have established during that time.  No  assessment
    was undertaken as to whether it was in her best interests to return  to
    India in light of his later findings that moving to India would have  a
    detrimental impact on AKB's education and that both  girls  would  have
    fewer opportunities there than  in  the  UK  and  are  more  likely  to
    experience discrimination on account of their gender  [66(iv)-(v)].  To
    simply rely on the respondent's statement that it  would  generally  be
    reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK  with  her  parents  was
    insufficient and failed to consider a number of relevant  factors  that
    were material to a proper assessment of whether it would be  reasonable
    to expect the child to leave the UK at the date of the application. For
    these reasons I conclude that the First-tier Tribunal decision relating
    to AKB's appeal against the decision dated 12 March 2018  involved  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

22.   In relation to the parents, it is  not  arguable  that  the  delay  in
    decision making or the delay in hearing the appeal would have made  any
    material difference to the outcome of the First-tier Tribunal decision.
    The appellants did not meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)
    of the immigration rules. Despite the delays the appellants still  fell
    far short of the requirements for leave to remain on  grounds  of  long
    residence  either  under  paragraph  276B  or  276ADE(1)(iii)  of   the
    immigration rules. I was not referred to anything in  the  evidence  to
    show that the appellants had  established  any  significant  let  alone
    compelling ties during the period of delay.

23.   On behalf of the first and  second  appellants  Mr  Jafferji  accepted
    that their appeals depended to a large extent on  the  outcome  of  the
    appeals of their children. It is not arguable that they could  rely  on
    section 117B(6) at the date of the First-tier Tribunal hearing  because
    neither daughter was a 'qualifying child'. At the date of  the  hearing
    IB was 20 years old and AKB was 18 years old. To the  extent  that  the
    parents could still rely on an overall assessment  of  Article  8  they
    needed to show a sufficiently  strong  family  life  with  their  adult
    children of the kind that would still engage the operation of Article 8
    of the European  Convention.  Although  the  grounds  relating  to  the
    parents are significant weaker, in so far as the evidence suggests that
    at least one of their daughters does not appear to have established  an
    independent life away from her parents, their family  life  with  their
    daughters is a matter that might be relevant to a proper assessment  of
    the balancing exercise under Article 8. If there is an error of law  in
    the judge's finding relating to the assessment of AKB's  appeal  it  is
    likely to have affected the assessment of the parents'  claim  to  some
    extent. To this end it is pragmatic to set aside the  judge's  findings
    relating to the first and second appellants as well in order to  remake
    the decision with  a  few  to  a  holistic  assessment  of  the  family
    circumstances.

24.   The First-tier Tribunal decision relating to the  appeals  of  AB,  VB
    and AKB involved the making of an error of law.

25.   I have also found, in a separate but linked decision, that the  First-
    tier Tribunal decision relating to IB involved the making of  an  error
    of law.

26.   The normal course of action would be for the Upper Tribunal to  remake
    the decision. I see no reason to depart from that course in this  case.
    The factual background relating to the appellants' length of  residence
    and immigration history does not appear to  be  disputed.  The  judge's
    findings relating to the less favourable conditions IB  and  AKB  would
    face as  women  in  India  have  not  been  challenged  and  should  be
    preserved. The judge's findings relating to the Tier 1 application  and
    the  parents'  failure  to   meet   the   requirements   of   paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) are also preserved.

27.   It is possible that the Article 8 claims relating to AB,  VB  and  AKB
    could be remade and determined on the papers already before  the  Upper
    Tribunal. However, it seems to me that there might be  some  difficulty
    in remaking the decision relating to IB without a further  hearing  and
    to that extent it seems appropriate to relist the matter for a  resumed
    hearing. However, it will be assumed that nothing more in  the  way  of
    evidence is needed from these three appellants unless there has been  a
    significant change in  circumstances.  It  is  anticipated  that  those
    appeals  can  be  dealt  with  by  way  of  submissions  only.  Further
    directions have been made in relation to IB.

DIRECTION

28.   The parties are granted permission to serve any up  to  date  evidence
    in support of the appeals, which must be served at least 14 days before
    the resumed hearing.


DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making of an error on a  point
of law

The appeals will be listed for a resumed hearing  for  the  decision  to  be
remade
