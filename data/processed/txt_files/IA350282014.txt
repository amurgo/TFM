For the Respondent:    Unrepresented


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department,
    hereafter referred to as the Respondent, as she was before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal. Miss Kang is therefore  the  Appellant.  The  appeal  is
    against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Rothwell  (hereafter
    Judge Rothwell) promulgated on 4 June 2015 by  which  she  allowed  the
    appeal of the Appellant.

 2. The appeal was dismissed under the Immigration Rules but allowed  under
    Article 8.

 3. The Appellant is a national of China,  born  on  24  March  1984.   She
    originally appealed against the decision of  the  Respondent  dated  12
    August 2014 refusing to grant her indefinite leave  to  remain  on  the
    basis of her long residence in the United  Kingdom.   The  Respondent's
    decision to refuse to grant leave to remain was considered on the basis
    of paragraph 276B and 276ADE of the Immigration  Rules.   It  was  said
    first of all that the Appellant had not acquired the requisite ten year
    continuous lawful residence in the United Kingdom,  and  therefore  did
    not satisfy the requirements of paragraph 276B of the Rules.

 4. In respect of 276ADE of the Rules it was said that there would  not  be
    any significant obstacles in respect of the Appellant returning to live
    in China.  Appendix FM to the Immigration  Rules  was  also  considered
    briefly but it was said that the Appellant could  not  satisfy  any  of
    those provisions.  In addition the application was  considered  outside
    the Rules.  However the Respondent declined to exercise her  discretion
    in the Appellant's favour.

Judge Rothwell's decision

 5. The matter came before Judge Rothwell on 11 May 2015.   Judge  Rothwell
    found that the  Appellant  could  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  In respect of paragraph 276B Judge  Rothwell  found
    that the Appellant had not in fact  acquired  the  required  ten  years
    continuous lawful residence in this country.  In respect  of  paragraph
    276ADE of the Rules Judge Rothwell concluded that there  were  no  very
    significant obstacles to the Appellant's integration back into  Chinese
    society (see paragraph 24 of her decision).

 6. In respect of Appendix FM to the Rules, Judge Rothwell found  that  the
    Appellant could not succeed under these provisions  either.   This  was
    because the eligibility  requirements  were  not  met  given  that  the
    Appellant's partner, Mr  Rutherford,  was  neither  her  fianc�  nor  a
    qualifying partner with whom she had cohabited for two years  or  more.
    Judge Rothwell stated that the Respondent had  misdirected  herself  in
    relation to a discretion outside the Rules based  on  policy  guidance.
    However,  Judge  Rothwell  found  that  in  this  case  there  were  no
    compelling circumstances in any event.

 7. Judge Rothwell went on to consider the application of EX.1B and EX.2 of
    Appendix FM.   She  concluded  that  there  were  no  very  significant
    difficulties in respect of family life between  the  Appellant  and  Mr
    Rutherford continuing  overseas.   She  concluded  that  Mr  Rutherford
    could, if necessary, accompany the Appellant to China if he chose to do
    so.  Judge Rothwell concluded that the criteria set  out  in  EX.1  and
    EX.2 were not satisfied.

 8. The judge then went on to consider the Article 8 case  outside  of  the
    Rules.  She said that she was entitled to do so because  the  Appellant
    and Mr Rutherford  had  been  in  a  relationship  since  2008.   Judge
    Rothwell went on to apply the methodology set  out  in  the  well-known
    case of Razgar.  It was accepted that the  Appellant  was  still  in  a
    relationship with Mr Rutherford and that the Appellant  had  a  private
    life given that she had resided in the United Kingdom since 2001.

 9. At paragraph 32 of her decision Judge  Rothwell  concluded  that  there
    would not be any interference with the Appellant's private  and  family
    life if she were to be removed from the United Kingdom.  It  was  found
    the Appellant's private life could  continue  in  China  and  that  the
    Appellant could make an application if necessary from China  to  return
    to this country as the spouse or fianc�e  of  Mr  Rutherford  if  their
    relationship progressed.

10. Notwithstanding the  finding  that  there  was  no  interference  Judge
    Rothwell went  on  to  consider  the  issue  of  proportionality.   She
    considered various factors set out in Section 117B of the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act  2002.   She  found  that  the  relationship
    between  the  Appellant  and  Mr  Rutherford  could  not  satisfy   the
    Immigration Rules because although they  had  been  in  a  relationship
    since 2008 they were not  engaged,  they  did  not  cohabit,  were  not
    married, and therefore they could not apply for entry  clearance  under
    Appendix FM as the situation then stood.

11. Judge Rothwell went on to say that the Respondent had  decided  not  to
    exercise a discretion in the Appellant's favour.  She  also  took  into
    account the fact that the Appellant's absence from the  United  Kingdom
    which had broken her ten years continuous lawful residence here was  on
    the  basis  of  her  studies  at  the  University  of  Leeds  and   the
    international experience that she was advised by  that  institution  to
    obtain.  Finally  at  paragraph  38  of  her  decision  Judge  Rothwell
    concluded that when balancing the rights of the Appellant  against  the
    public interest she found that this was  a  case  where  unusually  the
    rights of the Appellant outweighed the public interest  in  removal  to
    China.

The grounds of appeal

12. The Respondent sought permission  to  appeal  on  the  basis  of  three
    grounds.  Ground  1  related  to  a  misdirection  in  law  as  to  the
    availability of a discretion outside of the Rules which should not have
    been considered by  Judge  Rothwell  but  instead  sent  back  for  the
    Respondent to deal with.  Ground 2 relates to the Article 8  claim  and
    in particular to Judge Rothwell's decision to consider the case outside
    of the Rules.  Reliance was placed on the case  of  SS  (Congo)  [2015]
    EWCA Civ 387.  The judge, it is said, failed to consider why  the  case
    was to be considered outside of the Rules, given  the  requirements  of
    the Rules and the fact that they had not been met  in  this  particular
    case.

13.  Ground  3  is  a  challenge  to  the  substance  of  Judge  Rothwell's
    consideration of the claim outside of  the  Rules.   It  is  said  that
    although Judge Rothwell had concluded that there  was  no  interference
    with the  private  or  family  life  of  the  Appellant  she  had  then
    subsequently ignored that selfsame finding when continuing to  consider
    the issue of proportionality.   In  addition  it  is  said  that  Judge
    Rothwell had overlooked previous findings that  she  herself  had  made
    earlier on in her decision when assessing proportionality.

14. Permission to appeal on all ground was granted by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Shimmin by a decision dated 10 August 2015.

The hearing before me

15. On reflection, Mr Tufan decided not to rely on ground 1 as he said that
    it  made  no  material  difference  to  the  decision  that  was  being
    challenged.  It is said that the issue of the discretion outside of the
    Rules had in fact already been considered  by  the  Respondent  in  her
    refusal letter dated 12 August 2014.  Mr Tufan did rely  on  grounds  2
    and 3.

16.  The  Appellant,  who  appeared  before  me  unrepresented,  said   the
    following.  She confirmed that she was still in a relationship with  Mr
    Rutherford and that she had been in this country lawfully  since  2001.
    She was concerned by the time taken for the resolution of  her  appeal.
    She had already been before the First-tier Tribunal in 2014,  her  case
    had then been sent back to the Respondent, and this was the second time
    round for her.  She was anxious that final resolution of  her  case  be
    made as quickly as possible.

17. The Appellant had previously been represented by solicitors.  They  had
    ceased to act for her prior to the hearing before me.  I confirmed with
    her at the outset that she was happy to proceed today and she confirmed
    that she was.

Decision on Error of Law

18. It is clear to me that Judge Rothwell made a number of errors of law in
    her decision.

19. She considered whether or not EX1 and EX2 applied in this case when  in
    light of the case of Sabir [2014] UKUT 63 (IAC) she had no jurisdiction
    to do so given that  she  had  already  decided  that  the  eligibility
    requirements of Appendix FM could not be met in view of the  nature  of
    the relationship between the Appellant and Mr Rutherford.

20. The second error relates to the judge's decision to consider  the  case
    outside of the Rules. Whilst she may have been entitled to consider the
    case outside of the Rules, she was bound in my view to explain  clearly
    why she was doing s what weight was to be attached to the fact that the
    Appellant could not meet the Rules as they relate to Article 8 (in this
    case Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE).  The need to explain  why  this
    exercise outside the Rules was being undertaken is clear  in  light  of
    the Court of Appeal decision SS (Congo) (see for example paragraphs  31
    to 48 of the  judgment).   All  that  is  said  by  Judge  Rothwell  at
    paragraph 30 of her decision is that on the facts of  the  case  before
    her the Rules did not cover the situation because the Appellant and  Mr
    Rutherford had been in a relationship since 2008 and when she left this
    country and re-entered the United Kingdom in 2009 she still  had  leave
    to  remain.   In  my  view  that  does  not  adequately   address   the
    requirements and the guidance given  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  SS
    (Congo). There is certainly no indication of "compelling circumstances"
    in respect of why the claim should succeed outwith the Rules.

21. The next error of law involves the  conclusion  at  paragraph  32  that
    there would not be any interference with the  Appellant's  private  and
    family life if she were to be removed.  Given this conclusion I  cannot
    see how it was then possible for the judge to then go on  and  consider
    the question of proportionality.  If there was no interference with the
    private and/or family life  then  the  Razgar  methodology  would  have
    stopped at that point.

22. Then there is Judge Rothwell's  consideration  of  the  proportionality
    issue, which I will deal with in any event.   Although  she  does  deal
    with a number of the factors set out in Section 117B of the  2002  Act,
    she does not in my view apply  the  relevant  factors  adequately.   It
    appears as though she has failed to reduce the weight accorded  to  the
    private life given that this life was established and continued  during
    a time when the Appellant's immigration status was  precarious,  albeit
    over a lengthy period of time (see paragraph 35).

23. In addition, the Appellant's obvious ability to speak very good English
    and her ability to financially maintain herself are, to all intents and
    purposes, neutral factors. However Judge Rothwell appears to have dealt
    with them as being factors in the Appellant's favour.

24. Perhaps more importantly, at paragraph 36 Judge  Rothwell  states  that
    there was no route by which the Appellant could  return  to  China  and
    make an entry clearance application to  re-enter  the  United  Kingdom.
    However, this appears on its face to overlook the findings that she had
    previously made in paragraph 32 that an  application  could  have  been
    made  on  the  basis  that  if  the  relationship  with  Mr  Rutherford
    progressed, the Appellant could be either  the  spouse  or  indeed  the
    fianc�e of Mr Rutherford.

25. In paragraph 37 Judge Rothwell makes reference to the decision  of  the
    Respondent not to exercise discretion in  the  Appellant's  favour  and
    appears to place weight on this fact  when  undertaking  the  balancing
    exercise.  However, again  this  appears  to  overlook  the  fact  that
    earlier on in her decision at paragraph 23 Judge Rothwell  herself  had
    found that  there  not  compelling  circumstances  in  the  Appellant's
    favour.

26. For all the reasons given above Judge Rothwell materially erred in  law
    and on this basis I set her decision aside.  Urged by the appellant and
    with no objection by Mr  Tufan  I  decided  that  I  would  remake  the
    decision myself based upon the evidence before me.

The remake decision

27. In remaking the decision I have had regard to all the  evidence  before
    me including the Appellant's two bundles.

28. Whilst the Appellant has a good immigration record in this country, she
    has not achieved the ten years continuous lawful residence, as required
    by paragraph 276B of the Rules. Two judges of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judges Cohen (who heard the Appellant's initial appeal  in  2014,  and
    Rothwell) have concluded that she  was  absent  from  this  country  in
    excess of one hundred and eighty days by virtue of the  tine  spent  in
    China undertaking relevant work experience. This absence is accepted by
    the Appellant and I find that it in fact occurred.

29. The Appellant therefore cannot meet the  requirements  of  the  'lawful
    long residence' Rule.

30. I agree with Judge Rothwell that there are no compelling  circumstances
    in this case in relation to the period of absence. It is right that the
    Appellant undertook the work experience on the advice of her university
    in the United Kingdom. However, this was done to  further  her  studies
    and future prospects. It was undertaken freely.

31. In any  event,  the  Respondent  in  fact  addressed  the  question  of
    discretion outside of the Rules in her reasons for refusal letter of 12
    August 2014 (see page 4 of 5). I have no jurisdiction to  consider  the
    exercise of a discretion exercised outside of the Rules.

32. In respect of paragraph 276ADE(vi) of the Rules, I conclude that  there
    are no very significant obstacles to the Appellant's reintegration into
    Chinese society. In fairness to the Appellant, she has not put  forward
    any real assertion to the  contrary.  She  is  a  highly  educated  and
    talented individual who would be readily able to  re-establish  herself
    in China. Indeed, she would be a real asset to that country, as she  is
    to the United Kingdom. I note from her witness statements that she  has
    visited China several times since arriving here in 2001.  In  addition,
    there is no reason to believe that she does not have family in China.

33. In respect of Appendix FM, the partner route is not open to her because
    of the definition of "partner": Mr Rutherford, whom  I  accept  is  her
    long-term boyfriend, does not come within the stated definition.  As  a
    result, the provisions of EX cannot be applied to her case.

34. Turning to the claim outside of the Rules,  I  conclude  that  it  must
    fail. I readily accept that the Appellant has a private and family life
    in the United Kingdom, based upon her  time  and  ties  here,  and  the
    relationship with Mr Rutherford. Removal from the United Kingdom  would
    result in an interference with protected rights. However, the decisions
    to refuse to vary leave and to remove her  are,  in  my  view,  clearly
    proportionate from the perspective of Article 8.

35. The Rules have not been met insofar as they cater for Article  8.  That
    in itself represents a significant hurdle to the Appellant.  The  Rules
    encompass the issues of time spent away from one's  own  country,  ties
    established that period, and relationships formed  with  partners.  The
    gap between the scope of the Rules and a claim outside of them  is,  in
    the circumstances of this case, a narrow one indeed. The Appellant  has
    only ever been here on a precarious basis, as that  term  is  currently
    understood. There are no circumstances in this case which can  properly
    be described as compelling.  There  is  nothing  on  the  face  of  the
    evidence before me to show that  Mr  Rutherford  could  not  reasonably
    relocate  to  China.  In  addition,  given  the  Appellant's  admirable
    qualifications and work experience,  an  application  from  abroad  for
    entry clearance in an appropriate category (whether that relates to her
    relationship with Mr Rutherford or  her  employment)  would  appear  to
    stand a good chance of being successful.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

I re-make the decision by dismissing the appeal under the Immigration  Rules
and on human rights grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
