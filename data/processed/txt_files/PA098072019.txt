For the Appellant: Mr Adebayo of A2 Solicitors.
For the Respondent: Mr Bates Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. On 19 February 2020 a Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal set aside a
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal  which  allowed  the  appellants
       appeal on all grounds.
    2. A judicial transfer order has been made and the  matter  comes  back
       before the Upper Tribunal to enable it to substitute a  decision  to
       either allow or dismiss the appeal.



Background


    3. The appellant claims to be an undocumented and  therefore  stateless
       Bidoon from Kuwait who was born on the 1 January 1980.
    4. The appellant claims he married in 2003 and has  three  children,  a
       son and two daughters, who remain in Kuwait.
    5. The appellant claims his father died in 2018. His mother remains  in
       Kuwait as do his two brothers and two sisters.
    6. The appellant claims that he is  undocumented  as  during  the  1965
       census his family resided in the desert and were unaware of the need
       to register. The appellant claims both he and his father  approached
       the Bidoon Committee in Kuwait, but they could  not  assist  as  the
       family were not on the census.
    7. The appellant claims that as a result  he  was  only  able  to  gain
       employment on the black-market selling fruit and vegetables  from  a
       market stall for cash.
    8. The appellant also claimed he attended a political demonstration  on
       the 18 February 2014 at which the  authorities  began  to  beat  and
       arrest the demonstrators. The appellant fled to  his  home  but  was
       arrested on 24 February 2014 there by the authorities.
    9. The appellant claims he was  beaten,  verbally  abused,  accused  of
       swearing at the Emir, damaging government property and attempting to
       overthrow the government for which he was detained for 3 months. The
       appellant was eventually released after  signing  an  admission  and
       agreement to provide information to the security forces.
   10. The appellant stated he informed his father who arranged for him  to
       go into hiding in the wilderness and stay with a friend.
   11.  The  appellant  stated  that  whilst  in  hiding  he  leaned   that
       authorities were looking for him and so on 19 August 2015 he flew to
       Turkey from Kuwait, from Turkey to Greece, from  Greece  to  Austria
       and then to Finland on 10 September 2015.
   12. The appellant claimed he was beaten by racist in Finland and  forced
       to have his fingerprints taken by the authorities there.
   13.  The  appellant  stated  that  during  his  journey,  if  asked  his
       nationality, he claimed to be either Iraqi or Syrian.
   14. In addition to his own witness statements the appellant relies  upon
       a report from the Kuwaiti Community Association and the evidence  of
       two witnesses.
   15. One of the witnesses, FMZA, appeared before the First-tier  Tribunal
       but the second witness MRA did not.
   16. The report  of  the  Kuwaiti  Community  Association  sets  out  the
       methodology they apply in ascertaining whether a person is a Kuwaiti
       Bidoon based upon an interview with the  person  concerned  and  two
       witnesses whom they asked the client to provide. Of those  witnesses
       only one appeared to support the appellant before the Upper Tribunal
       and so statements confirming the appellant's ethnicity and  identity
       from the other could not be challenged or explored by way of  cross-
       examination.
   17. The report concludes "FGAA has knowledge of the place that he claims
       to have lived in. Two witnesses from the Bidoons community  here  in
       the UK who know him and confirmed that he is an undocumented Bidoon.
       The interview findings and witness statement support FGAA's claim to
       be undocumented Bidoon from Kuwait".
   18. The appellant claims that he is related  to  one  of  his  witnesses
       which is not contested.
   19. In his statement the witness MRA states he is an undocumented Bidoon
       who claimed asylum on the UK and who was accepted on appeal as being
       an undocumented Bidoon. The witness states he  knows  the  appellant
       well as he is his aunts neighbour in Kuwait, although he was  unable
       to accurately name  the  aunt  when  asked  by  Mr  Bates  in  cross
       examination. MRA also claimed that he is  aware  of  the  appellants
       situation as they  discuss  their  situation  when  they  meet.  The
       witness identified the nature of the appellants work in  Kuwait  was
       as he claimed.
   20. The second  witness,  who  attended  before  the  FTT,  FMZA  is  an
       undocumented Bidoon whose claim was accepted by the respondent.  The
       witness claims to know the appellant  as  he  is  his  wife's  half-
       brother. He also stated he attended the demonstration on 18 February
       2014 and saw the appellant there.
   21. There is also support for the appellant's claim  that  there  was  a
       demonstration in Kuwait in 2014 during the course of which a  number
       of  individuals  were  arrested  and  those  of  interest   to   the
       authorities charged and taken before the courts.
Discussion
   22. As submitted by Mr Bates the appellant's case is a simple claim of a
       person not politically  active  who  has  undertaken  no  sur  place
       activities in the UK who attended one demonstrated, after  which  he
       was arrested and ill-treated, being at risk as he is wanted  by  the
       authorities in addition to his claim to be  an  undocumented  Bidoon
       and to suffer discrimination as a result.
   23. In NM (documented/undocumented Bidoon: risk) Kuwait CG  [2013]  UKUT
       00356(IAC) it was held that (i) The  distinction  made  in  previous
       country guidance in respect of Kuwaiti Bidoon, between those who are
       documented and those who are undocumented, is  maintained,  but  the
       relevant crucial document, from  possession  of  which  a  range  of
       benefits depends, is the  security  card,  rather  than  the  "civil
       identification  documents"  referred  to  in  the  previous  country
       guidance in HE [2006] UKAIT 00051. To that extent the guidance in HE
       is amended; (ii) The evidence relating to the documented Bidoon does
       not show them to be at real risk of persecution or breach  of  their
       protected human right; (ii)he evidence concerning  the  undocumented
       Bidoon does show them to face a real risk of persecution  or  breach
       of their protected human rights;  (iii)  It  must  be  assumed  that
       Bidoon who did not register between 1996 and 2000, and hence did not
       obtain security cards, are as  a  consequence  undocumented  Bidoon,
       though this must be seen in the context of the  evidence  that  most
       Bidoon carry security cards.
   24. It is accepted that in addition to the appellant's own  evidence  he
       has the support of two  live  witnesses  and  the  letter  from  the
       Kuwaiti Community Association.
   25. The Association letter confirms matters not in dispute  in  relation
       to the appellant being a Kuwait Bidoon  but  the  conclusion  he  is
       undocumented is based upon the appellant's claims to  be  such,  and
       two named witness put forward by the appellant who are known  to  be
       undocumented Bidoon. Of those one attended to support the  appellant
       today.
   26. There is merit in Mr Bates submission that it is possible  for  some
       members of a family to be undocumented and some not and so the  fact
       FMZA and the other witness have been accepted as being  undocumented
       is not determinative. There is also merit in the submission there is
       no support for the appellant's contention that his father was unable
       to register as he did not appear on the 1965 census  in  the  report
       from the Kuwaiti Community Association despite it being  known  this
       is an issue at large in the case for some time.
   27. In light of the issues raised in the case it is necessary to examine
       all relevant country material and to assess the weight that  can  be
       given to the appellant's evidence in light of the  same,  especially
       in light of the issues raised in  the  Reasons  for  Refusal  letter
       which raise a number of valid concerns.
   28. Whilst the respondent accepted the appellant comes from  Kuwait  and
       is a Bidoon, it is not accepted he is an undocumented Bidoon.
   29. Between [62 - 80]  of  the  Reasons  for  Refusal  letter  dated  27
       September 2019 a number of issues were identified by  the  decision-
       maker leading to  the  conclusion  at  [80]  "As  a  result  of  the
       information in the paragraphs above, it is considered that you  have
       been internally and externally inconsistent  with  regards  to  your
       claim to be an undocumented Bidoon of Kuwait. Therefore this  aspect
       of your claim is not accepted".
   30. The decision-maker also cast doubt upon the appellant's claim not to
       have been able to receive an education in Kuwait and to not be  able
       to read and write on the basis that the country information relating
       to Kuwaiti Bidoon dated July 2016 states  "access  to  schooling  is
       available in Kuwait for Bidouns: Bidoun parents  sometimes  have  to
       send their children to feepaying schools as some are  excluded  from
       Free State schools, although there is a  state  sponsored  fund  for
       education that Bidoun families can access'.
   31. It is noted in the refusal letter that when the appellant was  asked
       why he could not access  education  prior  to  1987  in  the  asylum
       interview, on the basis of a Human Rights Watch report which  stated
       that prior to 1987 all Bidoon received free education at  government
       school and until  1993,  free  healthcare  on  a  par  with  Kuwaiti
       citizens  with  freedom  of  employment  and  that  they  formed   a
       substantial part of Kuwait's army and police forces, the appellant's
       reply was to state that they came to Al Hasawe in 1988 at which time
       everything was closed. The decision-maker notes  the  appellant  did
       not directly answer the question put  forward  which  was  found  to
       weaken his credibility. Added to this it was noted at [87] that  the
       appellant had claimed to have been born in Chebet and to have  moved
       to Al Hasawe when he was eight years of age which would have been in
       1988 and to have moved to Al Jahra when he was 11 or 12 years of age
       which would have been in 1991 or 1992, which was, in the opinion  of
       the decision-maker, a further example of discrepant statements which
       damage the appellant's credibility.
   32. At [88] of the refusal letter it is noted the appellant  claimed  to
       have no access to medical care as a Bidoon and that if  he  required
       urgent  medical  treatment  he  would  go  to  a  pharmacy  or  have
       traditional treatment and that  if  anything  serious  happened  his
       parents would get treatment in a  private  hospital.  The  decision-
       maker refers to the country guidance case of NM in which it was held
       that until  1993  the  Bidoon  residents  of  Kuwait  received  free
       treatment at public clinics and hospitals  although  the  government
       subsequently began to require them to pay user fees  which  in  1999
       were replaced by health insurance plans.  It  is  said  Bidoons  who
       carry security cards can purchase low cost  health  insurance  to  a
       government registered  program  although  also  noted  that  Bidoons
       without security cards reported that  they  were  denied  access  to
       government clinics  and  hospitals  altogether.  The  decision-maker
       states the appellant failed to mention the available  treatment  and
       timeline set out above and  that  his  vague  and  unsure  responses
       regarding medical treatment lacked the  detail  reasonably  expected
       from him in his asylum interview.
   33. In relation to the appellant's economic situation, he claims to have
       worked as a vegetable seller in Kuwait earning three or four  dinars
       per day. If the appellant worked a six-day week his  monthly  income
       at its highest would therefore have been in the region of 100  dinar
       per month against which he claimed to pay 180 dinar  month  in  rent
       and in relation to which it was noted at [92] of the refusal  letter
       that it was unclear as to how the appellant could feed  himself  his
       wife and four children when considering the cost of household items.
   34. At [90] the decision-maker writes "You were not able to indicate  as
       to how many days in the month you  worked.  You  simply  stated  'if
       there is no hassle from the municipality, I worked the  whole  week'
       the decision-maker at [91] states it  was  unclear  as  to  how  the
       appellant was able to afford to live in Kuwait on his wage which was
       not even guaranteed and that it was not credible that  the  landlord
       was renting the house to  the  appellant  and  his  family  with  no
       paperwork or agreement and that  his  undocumented  status  was  not
       taken into account.
   35. At [92] the decision-maker writes: "Based  on  the  information  you
       have provided, it is considered that you have been unable to  remain
       consistent within your account  of  your  life  as  an  undocumented
       Bidoon, nor have you been able to  provide  a  sufficient  level  of
       reasonably  expected  detail.  Therefore,  your  claim  to   be   an
       undocumented Bidoon is rejected".
   36. In relation to the witness who attended  to  support  the  appellant
       before the First-tier Tribunal, but who did not  appear  before  the
       Upper Tribunal, Mr Bates submitted  the  appellant's  reliance  upon
       that witness who he claimed knew him  and  who  he  relied  upon  in
       support of his claim not only damages  the  appellant's  credibility
       but casts doubt upon the reliability of the witnesses he  now  seeks
       to rely upon.
   37. In relation to that witness the First-tier Tribunal Judge wrote:
       56.    Witness NAI. His statement is short.  I  find  that  this  is
             because he had nothing of value to  add  to  the  matter.  The
             witness was vague and evasive to the extreme and I  find  that
             he cannot be relied upon at all. I do not accept he ever  knew
             the appellant, and whilst I recognise that  this  witness  has
             been granted asylum, following an appeal, I  cannot  but  find
             that he made up the entirety of his evidence before me  as  to
             any knowledge whatsoever of the appellant in  Kuwait.  He  was
             unable to provide any clear  evidence  as  to  any  connection
             between himself and the appellant and behaved in a belligerent
             manner before the Tribunal. Whose idea it was to bring along a
             "rent a  witness",  I  do  not  know,  but  this  damages  the
             appellant's credibility as he must have had involvement in the
             decision to include this man as a witness.
   38. Although the First-tier decision has been set aside it still  stands
       as a record of the evidence given by the witnesses on that occasion.
   39. The First-tier Tribunal also records that the  appellant  in  either
       his asylum interview, his statements, or at the hearing,  showed  no
       real knowledge of the situation in  Kuwait  for  the  Bidoon,  which
       remains the situation before the Upper Tribunal.
   40. The appellant's evidence was that as a result of his difficulties in
       Kuwait his father arranged the services of an agent  who  eventually
       assisted the appellant to enter the United  Kingdom.  The  appellant
       flew from Kuwait to Turkey and his whole journey  seems  to  be  one
       which, according to his evidence, enabled him in a relatively  short
       period of time to travel from Kuwait to the UK with  the  assistance
       of a number of agents. The appellant claimed that he was unaware  of
       the arrangements for such an enterprise and in particular  the  cost
       as it was arranged by his father with the assistance  and  donations
       from others.
   41. The appellant's evidence to the First-tier Tribunal was that the man
       in whose stable he was living whilst he was in hiding met his father
       regularly, making it more likely that the appellant will  have  been
       fully aware of the plans for him to leave Kuwait and the details  of
       the same if his claim is credible.
   42. Mr Bates submissions regarding the plausibility of such a claim have
       arguable merit. The appellant claims to be a member  of  the  Bidoon
       community  who,  on  the  basis  his   father   could   not   obtain
       registration, must mean the appellant was claiming his father too is
       undocumented. Despite this the  appellant  claims  he  was  able  to
       travel by air with the services of an  agent  through  a  number  of
       countries before coming to the United Kingdom which it is reasonable
       to assume would have cost a considerable sum of money.
   43. An article in Guardian newspaper dated April 2016  illustrates  this
       point where it is written:


         Migrants attempting to reach the UK are paying smuggling  gangs  as
         much as �13,500 to arrange their journey, the National Crime Agency
         (NCA) has revealed.



         Some of those intent on coming to Britain  are  quoted  five-figure
         sums to make the trip by air, while others  are  believed  to  have
         spent as much as �12,000 to travel from France in inflatable boats.

         It also emerged  that  criminal  networks  are  suspected  to  have
         started targeting quieter ports on the east  and  south  coasts  in
         addition to the key hotspot, Kent.

         The NCA - the UK's equivalent to the FBI - is running  the  largest
         dedicated operation against organised immigration crime in Europe.

         Officers said the cost varies hugely depending on the service being
         sought from the gang.

         Factors that affect the  price  include  whether  migrants  want  a
         staged or "end-to-end" trip, how much they can afford and the level
         of risk perceived by smugglers.

   44. The appellant has failed to establish as credible his claim that  he
       lived in a family that was economically  discriminated  against  yet
       they were able to afford the substantial sums  required  to  finance
       his journey to the United Kingdom.
   45. The costs of the agent must also have included the cost of the  blue
       Kuwaiti passport which the appellant claimed the agent obtained  for
       him. It is also the appellant's case that this passport enabled  him
       to travel through the Kuwait International Airport, through controls
       in Turkey and any other checks that would have been  made  upon  his
       travel documents. If this was a  genuine  passport  into  which  his
       photograph had been placed by an agent, as the  appellant  suggests,
       it would have cost a considerable sum of money.
   46. I accept it was not a biometric  blue  passport  as  the  same  were
       introduced in 2017 after the  date  the  appellant  stated  he  left
       Kuwait.
   47. The country material also refers to  charges  being  brough  against
       those arrested and their being detained or released  on  bail  as  a
       result  of  the  2014  demonstration,  including  those  accused  of
       insulting the Emir. There is no evidence the appellant was  formerly
       charged. He claims to have been subject to a requirement  to  report
       every three weeks and to have signed a paper admitting having  sworn
       at the Emir. The appellant claimed he went  into  hiding  and  whist
       there discovered the authorities were looking for him.
   48. The appellants claim to be of continuing interest to the authorities
       is not made out on the evidence as if he was of such interest it  is
       more likely he would have been charged at the time. I find  this  to
       be an embellishment of the claim. The  appellant  confirmed  in  his
       oral evidence that he has  remained  in  contact  with  his  family,
       specifically his wife and his mother, in Kuwait who have remained in
       the same place, yet there is no statement from them  confirming  any
       ongoing interest in the appellant or documentary evidence to support
       any aspect of the claim.
   49. Although Kuwaiti Bidoon form a Particular Social  Group,  this  does
       not mean that establishing such membership  will  be  sufficient  to
       make out a case to be recognised as a refugee. The  question  to  be
       addressed in each case will be whether the  particular  person  will
       face a real risk of persecution on account of  their  membership  of
       such a group.
   50. As Mr Bates submitted, not all Bidoon are  stateless  as  some  have
       been granted citizenship through regularisation programmes.  Amnesty
       International stated that the Bidoon used to enjoy a status  similar
       to that of Kuwaiti citizens until the Decree  in  1986  changed  the
       status of the Bidoon from legal  residents  without  nationality  to
       "illegal residents".

   51. In her  commentary  on  the  Home  Office  Country  Information  and
       Guidance (CIG) Kuwait Bidoon, February  2014,  for  the  Independent
       Advisory Group on Country  Information  (IAGCI),  Claire  Beaugrand,
       Institut fran�ais du Proche Orient (Ifpo) noted that:

         'The issue of the Bidoon in  Kuwait  is  very  complex,  not  least
         because, over more than fifty years, the State of Kuwait  has  been
         dealing with it through inconsistent policies.  This  inconsistency
         created various incentives and expectations  on  the  part  of  the
         Bidoon, who developed, over time, different strategies  and  sought
         various types of papers in  order  to  maximize  their  chances  of
         naturalisation  or  solve  their  everyday  conundrums...   it   is
         important to  highlight  three  phases  of  different  governmental
         policies:'
         'Initially, from the early  1960s  to  1986  the  State  of  Kuwait
         tolerated the grey area between  nationals  and  foreigners,  as  a
         legacy of tribal nomadic practices but also as a convenient way  to
         staff its security forces.'
         'As of 1986, it went back on this tolerant policy  that  translated
         into an exemption from the provisions of the law 17/1959 on Aliens'
         residence; it then lumped all different cases together under a same
         "illegality" label. The government justified this  measure  by  the
         fact that illegal migrants who falsely pretended that they  had  no
         national affiliation abused the vaguely defined category of Bidoon.
         This ushered into a period of pressure  policy  that  stripped  the
         Bidoon of the rights they had enjoyed so far as state's  tolerance;
         the rationale of the policy was to force the Bidoon  to  regularise
         their status and "reveal their true origin." As of 1993,  different
         government authorities were successively created to implement  this
         policy.
         'While still tasked with  ascertaining  Bidoon's  national  origins
         (whether  foreign  or  Kuwaiti)  on  the  basis  of  crossing  data
         collected from all ministries and government agencies, the  Central
         System to Resolve Illegal Residents' Status (shortened  as  Central
         System), set up in November 2010,  has  gradually  and  selectively
         reversed the policy of  rights  deprivation.  Although  Bidoon  are
         still considered as "illegal residents", the Council  of  Ministers
         Decision No. 409/2011, promulgated on 6 March 2011, granted them  a
         set of civil and human privileges and facilities.

         Timeline

         1959  -  The  nationality  law  defines   categories   of   Kuwaiti
         nationality and a range of criteria and limitations.
         1985-1986 - The status of the Bidoon changed from  legal  residents
         without nationality to "illegal residents". The Alien Residence Act
         was  applied  to  Bidoon,  removing  most  rights   enjoyed   since
         independence (1961).
         1987 - drivers' licences ceased being issued or renewed to  Bidoon;
         the Bidoon were also no longer able to register  car  ownership  in
         their name.
         1990 - Iraq invasion of Kuwait. Number of Bidoon 250,000;  however,
         many fled during the war and were denied re-entry into Kuwait  when
         the war ended.
         1991 - Number of Bidoon in Kuwait approximately 125,000.
         1993 - The Central Committee  to  Resolve  the  Status  of  Illegal
         Residents was established to regularize the status of  the  Bidoon.
         Concluded March 1996.
         1996 - The  Executive  Committee  for  Illegal  Residents'  Affairs
         (ECIR) was established to process  all  those  who  claimed  to  be
         illegal residents (Bidoon).  Files  were  opened,  and  information
         shared on their status with all state ministries and  institutions.
         Those registered  with  the  ECIR  by  1996  were  given  temporary
         resident rights.
         2000  -  Law  passed  permitting  naturalisation   of   individuals
         registered in the 1965 census and  their  descendants,  limited  to
         2,000 per year, which has never been met.
         2005-2008 - 3,346 Bidoon granted citizenship.
         2010 - November: the Central System to Resolve  Illegal  Residents'
         Status was established  and  is  the  current  administrative  body
         responsible  for  reviewing  Bidoon  claims  to  nationality.   The
         Committee  has  accepted  that  34,000  Bidoon  are   meeting   the
         eligibility requirements for Kuwaiti citizenship. 68,000 Bidoon are
         said to be Iraqi citizens or have "other origins", and have 3 years
         to correct their status, or face  legal  action.  A  further  4,000
         individuals are recorded as status unknown.
         2011 - February.  Bidoon  community  began  protesting  peacefully,
         demanding to be recognized as  citizens  of  Kuwait.  The  security
         forces have  used  force  to  disperse  demonstrations  and  arrest
         protesters, some of whom are still on trial for taking part in  the
         demonstrations.
         2013 - March: Parliament passed a law  allowing  naturalisation  of
         4,000 "foreigners" during 2013. However, no Bidoon have  benefitted
         from this new law.
         2014 - February - March. Riot police  forces  arbitrarily  arrested
         protesters and dispersed the Bidoon demonstrators  with  tear  gas,
         smoke bombs, water canons, and  physical  violence.  Police  arrest
         main activists and organisers.
         2015 Government officials  suggest  that  Kuwait  may  "solve"  the
         Bidoon community's nationality claims by paying the Comoros Islands
         to grant the Bidoon a form of economic citizenship.
   52. The appellant has claimed though out that his  father  went  to  the
       Bidoon Committee every year between 1996 and  2000  but  was  turned
       away as it is claimed he had no proof of registering during the 1965
       census. Mr Bates raised the issue in his submissions that  there  is
       no evidence  from  the  appellant  nor  the  Bidoon  Association  or
       elsewhere to support a claim that a person was  unable  to  register
       during this period unless they  had  proof  of  entry  in  the  1965
       census. This submission is factually correct.
   53. The country material  refers  to  some  Bidoon  having  to  register
       annually to renew their security card, but the  appellant  does  not
       claim this was the purpose of their visit.
   54. The appellant claims he went with his father in 1998. At that  time,
       he would have been 18 but would not have appeared in the  census  of
       1965 as he was not born then.
     55. The timeline above refers to The Central Committee to  Resolve  the
         Status of Illegal Residents being established in 1993 to regularise
         the status of the Bidoon which was closed in March 1996. It is  not
         made out the appellants father sought regularisation from this body
         which it is fair to assume he would have  done  had  he  needed  or
         wanted to regularise his status.
     56. If the appellant is referring to his father attending the Executive
         Committee  for  Illegal  Residents'  Affairs   (ECIR)   which   was
         established  to  process  all  those  who  claimed  to  be  illegal
         residents (Bidoon), the country information shows that  files  were
         opened, and information shared  on  their  status  with  all  state
         ministries and institutions. Those registered with the ECIR by 1996
         were given temporary resident rights.  According  to  this  as  the
         appellant's father attended  in  1996,  he  must  have  been  given
         temporary residence rights.
     57. The entry for 2000 refers to a law passed permitting naturalisation
         of individuals registered in the 1965 census and their descendants,
         limited to 2,000 per year, which has never been met. The appellants
         father could not have applied under this  category  prior  to  this
         time as there is no evidence that such a specific category  existed
         as submitted by Mr Bates. Similarly it is not clear, if the law was
         passed in 2000 why the appellant claims his father stopped going to
         the Committee to make an application after this date, unless  there
         was no further need to do so as he was one of those  who  succeeded
         earlier.
     58. I find the appellant's claim that as his father was not  registered
         under the 1965 census, he  was  unable  to  secure  status  is  not
         supported by the country information.
     59. There is also the question of why the  appellant's  father  stopped
         applying as the means to do so still existed,  such  as  after  the
         creation of  the  Central  System  to  Resolve  Illegal  Residents'
         Status.
     60. The lack of reference to the bodies created to resolve  this  issue
         in Kuwait, whilst not providing a total solution  to  the  question
         under consideration, does cast doubt upon the  credibility  of  the
         appellant, especially in light of his  lack  of  knowledge  of  the
         undocumented Bidoon outlined in the refusal letter.
     61. Mr Bates also referred to paragraph 6.3 and 6.4.3 of the  CPIN  for
         Kuwait: Bidoon dated July 2016 in which it is stated:
         6.3 Green card (1996 -2000)
         6.3.1 Bidoon who registered with the the  Executive  Committee,  in
         charge of Bidoon between 1996 and 2000 (the  cut-off  date  set  by
         ministerial decree) were issued  with  security  cards  (informally
         known as green cards), which display personal  data  including  the
         registrant's name, address and date of birth. The  reverse  of  the
         card states that "this card does not serve as  proof  of  identity,
         and may be  used  only  for  specified  purposes."  The  cards  are
         recognised throughout the country as being held only by Bidoon.
         6.3.2  According  to  Human  Rights  Watch,  106,000   Bidoon   who
         registered with the Bidoon Committee between  1996  and  2000  were
         issued with security cards.
         ...
         6.4.3 The Kuwaiti Government stated that there  are  two  types  of
         review card which are issued to every person over the age  of  five
         who is registered  with  the  Central  System  to  Resolve  Illegal
         Residents' Status:
         ( 'The first type: Its duration is two years and it  is  issued  to
         those registered in the 1965 census or those who have proof of long-
         term residence in the country from that year or prior to it.
         ( The second type: Its duration is one year and is  issued  to  the
         remaining groups who are not registered in the 1965 census  and  do
         not have proof of long-term residence from that year  or  prior  to
         it.
     62. The country evidence supports a  finding  that  rather  than  being
         denied any form of recognition the appellants father will have been
         issued with a security  card,  which  he  may  have  had  to  renew
         annually, and the appellant in-line.  This  would  have  meant  the
         family were documented and as such able to access better  standards
         and opportunities which is a more  plausible  explanation  for  the
         ability of the appellant and/or his family to  have  been  able  to
         afford the considerable sums required to bring him  to  the  UK  in
         addition to the cost of living which exceeds  his  claimed  income,
         and additional costs such the private medical  care  the  appellant
         refers to.
     63. The appellant claims to have been beaten in detention but the  only
         medical evidence he sought to rely upon was  found  by  the  Deputy
         Upper Tribunal Judge at the error of law hearing to relate  to  the
         assult upon the appellant in Finland  and  not  to  any  events  in
         Kuwait, of which there in no corroborative evidence.
     64. The appellant accepted he lied during his journey to the UK when he
         claimed to be either an Iraqi or Syrian. The appellant  claimed  he
         was acting under the guidance of an agent yet claimed that  despite
         the intention always being to bring the appellant to  the  UK,  the
         agent gave him no advice on what to say to the authorities  in  the
         UK. I find the appellant has continued to be vague in  relation  to
         events concerning him, an issue identified by both  the  respondent
         in the refusal letter and at the earlier hearing.
     65. The appellant also  travelled  through  Greece,  Austria,  Finland,
         France and Belgium and was fingerprinted in Finland and France. The
         evidence as to  whether  he  made  a  claim  for  asylum  in  these
         countries is limited to a claim  to  have  made  such  in  Finland;
         although the appellant seems to suggest he left that country before
         his claim was determined. An attempt to  return  the  appellant  to
         Finland was cancelled as a result of his  actions.  The  appellants
         credibility is damaged pursuant to section  8  of  the  Asylum  and
         Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc) Act 2004 as a consequence
         of his failure to claim asylum in other safe countries for which no
         reasonable explanation has been provided.
     66. The country material speaks of undocumented Bidoon being unable  to
         rent property but the appellant claimed he was able to  do  so  and
         pay rent, the claim he was able to rent is raised  in  addition  to
         the economic issues identified in the refusal letter which, despite
         the appellant being aware of the same for some time, he has  failed
         to provide a satisfactory response to.
     67. When assessing the evidence in the round with the  required  degree
         of anxious scrutiny  and  applying  the  lower  standard  of  proof
         required in a claim of this nature I find the appellant has  failed
         to substantiate his claim to be  an  undocumented  Bidoon.  He  has
         shown himself to be an unreliable witness whose evidence  does  not
         stand up to scrutiny when examined against the country information.
         I find the evidence of the witnesses he has  relied  upon  warrants
         little weight being attached to it  in  relation  to  the  specific
         claims relating to the appellant.
     68. As it has not been proved the appellant is undocumented, he must be
         a documented Bidoon, which  is  more  plausible  finding  when  the
         evidence as a whole is considered. As such he fails to make  out  a
         credible claim for international protection, especially in light of
         the country guidance case law.
     69. I dismiss the appeal on protection and human rights grounds,  there
         being no  submissions made in relation to private or family life in
         the UK, although any interference with a protected right  has  been
         shown by the respondent to be proportionate in  any  event  in  the
         refusal latter.
