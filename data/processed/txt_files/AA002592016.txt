Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Sellwood, Counsel, instructed by Wimbledon
                    Solicitors (Merton Rd)
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of India born on 11 June 1985.  He  arrived
    in the United Kingdom on a valid student visa on 17 February 2009.   He
    extended his leave but on 14 August 2014 he was served with a notice of
    person liable to removal.  The Appellant then made an asylum claim.  He
    had a screening interview on 11 November 2015 but his  application  was
    refused on 10 February 2016.  The basis of his claim is that  he  would
    be at risk on return to India because of  his  sexual  orientation  and
    membership of a social group, i.e. gay men in  India.   This  Appellant
    also stated that he was in a same sex relationship with  MMN,  to  whom
    his case has been linked.

 2. His appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Pears on 21 July 2016.
     In a Decision and Reasons promulgated  on  8  August  2016  the  judge
    dismissed his appeal.

 3. Permission to appeal was sought in time on 21 August 2016,  essentially
    for the same reasons as in the linked case of his partner, i.e.

 1) a failure to take account of material  evidence  or  make  findings  on
    matters in dispute,

 2) a failure to give adequate reasons for findings of fact and

 3) the judge had materially misdirected himself in law.

 4. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Baker  on
    5 September 2016 on the following basis:

         "2.  The grounds have merit.  It is  apparent  the  FtTJ  may  have
             overlooked the evidence of witnesses, in  not  giving  reasons
             for concluding three witnesses' evidence was  generalised  and
             vague, paragraph 61.

         3.   All other grounds asserted in 4 - 6, 10, 12 are arguable."

    Hearing

5.   At the hearing before me this Appellant  was  also  represented  by  Mr
    Sellwood, who adopted the submissions that he had made  in  respect  of
    the linked case of MMH.  In addition he relied upon paragraphs 11 to 12
    of the grounds of appeal in relation to the treatment by the  judge  of
    the supporting evidence including the witness evidence of Mr  Butt  and
    Mr Waheed at [44] to [48].

6.   The effect of that evidence was that in MMH statement he says  that  he
    met his partner at a party given by Mr Waheed  in  December  2011.   He
    then married under pressure from  his  family  and  later  resumed  his
    friendship with the Appellant, the relationship became sexual at either
    the end of 2014 or early in 2015.

7.   In relation to Mr Butt, his evidence was that he allowed the  Appellant
    to live with  him  rent-free  and  he  supports  him  financially.   He
    confirmed that the Appellant is a gay man and that he had met  MMH  and
    was aware that he was in a relationship with the Appellant.

8.   It is the case that there are no clear findings apart from  that  brief
    record of the witnesses' evidence at [44] to [45] through to [48].  All
    the judge says at [58] is:

         "There are a number of coincidences and implausibilities  I  simply
         do not accept

         i.   A meeting at a cricket  match  which  led  to  extensive  free
             accommodation

         ii.  A meeting on a train that led to a party invitation

         iii. A telephone call in 2015 which prompted his claim for asylum

         iv.  A visit from the RSS in 2015 when he has  not  been  in  India
             since 2010."

9.   There are no reasons provided or analysis given as  to  why  the  judge
    does not accept the four points that he makes, the first two  of  which
    form part of the content of the witnesses' evidence.  The only  comment
    the judge makes about the witnesses is at [61]: "The  witnesses  in  my
    view do not assist the Appellant about the existence or persistence  of
    the relationship as they are generalised and vague."  This  finding  is
    not particularised, however and I find this to  amount  to  a  material
    error when statements were produced by both Mr Waheed and Mr Butt,  who
    were available to  give  evidence  and  to  be  cross-examined  by  the
    Respondent. It was also open to the judge  to  ask  the  witnesses  any
    questions that she wished to.

10.  Mr Sellwood additionally drew attention to a procedural fairness  issue
    in relation to this Appellant and that was the judge's finding at [59]:
    "As to his relationship with Mr MMN, they  do  not  live  together  and
    there has been no real explanation that I accept of why they  do  not."
    Mr Sellwood's submitted that this point was not put to the Appellant to
    give him the opportunity to provide the reason why  they  do  not  live
    together, which was essentially because of financial hardship.

Decision

11.  Following my decision in respect of the linked appeal  of  MMN  I  find
    that the judge erred materially in law for the reasons set out  in  the
    grounds of appeal.  The findings are contained at [52] to [63]  of  the
    judge's decision.  The findings are brief and in my view do not provide
    proper or adequately clear reasons so that the  Appellant  is  properly
    able to comprehend why his appeal has been dismissed and why his  claim
    to be gay and in a relationship with  MMN  has  been  rejected  by  the
    judge.

12.  There are of issues of credibility  that  remain  unresolved,  but  the
    judge's central findings in relation  to  sexual  orientation  and  the
    Appellant's same sex relationship with MMN I find are  not  sustainable
    and cannot be upheld. Therefore, I remit the appeal to  be  heard  with
    that of MMN

Notice of Decision

13.  The appeal is allowed to the extent that it is  remitted  back  to  the
    First Tier Tribunal for a hearing de novo.
