Representation:
For the Appellants:    Ms A Seehara, Counsel instructed by Nag Law
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellants are citizens of Sri Lanka of Sinhalese ethnicity.   They
    are husband, wife and daughter. Their respective dates of birth are  27
    July 1975, 29 February 1980 and 3 July 2013.  I understand  that  there
    is now a second child of the family. They made a claim for  asylum  and
    this was refused  by  the  Secretary  of  State  on  21  January  2016.
    Throughout this decision I shall refer to  AD  as  the  Appellant.  His
    family is dependent on his application.

2.   There is a history  of  litigation  in  this  matter.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the decision  of  the
    Respondent in 2016.  This decision was set aside by the Upper  Tribunal
    and remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissed the appeal in October 2017.  Permission was  granted  to  the
    Appellant. I found that the FTT materially  erred  and  set  aside  the
    decision to dismiss the Appellant's appeal. The matter came  before  me
    for a resumed hearing.

3.   The error of law decision reads as follows:

         "28. I have considered the decision as a whole to determine whether
             the judge erred in failing  to  give  adequate  reasons.   The
             judge did not find the Appellant and his wife  credible.   She
             found their evidence vague and evasive.  The reason given  for
             this in respect of the Appellant's wife, was that she did  not
             find her  evidence  about  the  Appellant's  arrest  credible.
             However, the evidence the judge referred to did not relate  to
             the second arrest.  It related to the first  arrest  and  made
             more sense in this  context  because  the  Appellant  was  not
             married at that time and he  and  his  wife  were  not  living
             together.  I conclude that this  is  an  error  of  law.   The
             Appellant's wife's evidence was material  evidence  supporting
             his claim; particularly about the second arrest and his  state
             on release about which the judge did not make findings.  Thus,
             ground 1 is made out.


         29.  There is merit in grounds 2 and 3.  It is not necessary for me
             to engage with them in significant detail.  Taken cumulatively
             the  errors  are  material.   The  judge   misunderstood   the
             relationship between the Appellant and the surety.  The  judge
             did not engage with the Appellant's evidence in respect of his
             relationship with  T  which  was  capable  of  supporting  the
             arrangements he made after T's death.  There was  no  evidence
             that the owner of the nightclub did not want to be  associated
             with  Tamils.   On   the   Appellant's   evidence   T's   LTTE
             associations were not known until after his detention  in  May
             2010.  This undermines the judges' (sic) conclusions at [54].


         30.  The Appellant's evidence was that he had been falsely  accused
             and it may not  be  that  surprising  that  the  investigation
             report would be at odds with the Appellant's  evidence  before
             the FtT.  The judge attached weight to the DVR.   This  relied
             on information from CID in Sri Lanka that confirmed  that  the
             arrest relied on by the Appellant was false.  Whilst the judge
             was entitled to  attach  weight  to  the  delay  in  obtaining
             documents, she did not  properly  engage  with  the  issue  of
             reliability of the documents in the context of the  method  of
             enquiry; see VT.


         31.  For all the above reasons the judge materially erred.   I  set
             aside the decision of the judge  to  dismiss  the  Appellant's
             appeal.   I  have  regard  to  Paragraph  7  of  the  Practice
             Statement of 25 September 2015.  There have been  two  appeals
             in the FtT.  The matter will be remade by the UT.  I make  the
             following directions:


             1.   The Appellant is  to  serve  and  file  a  paginated  and
                  indexed bundle not later than 14 days before the hearing.


             2.    The  Appellant  is  to  request  the  services   of   an
                  interpreter if required not later than 7 days  before  the
                  hearing."

4.   In response to  my  directions  the  Appellant  served  a  consolidated
    bundle. He relied on a document not within  that  bundle,  including  a
    letter from his mother of 31 October 2018.  There  was  also  a  bundle
    entitled "Background Evidence" for the hearing on 15 June 2016 on which
    Ms Seehara relied.  Ms Seehara relied on her skeleton argument that was
    before the First-tier Tribunal Judge  and  submitted  the  case  of  PA
    (protection claim: Respondent's enquiries; bias) Bangladesh [2018] UKUT
    0337.

5.   The Appellant relied on the evidence that was before the FTT  which  is
    found in the consolidated bundle.  It became clear at the hearing  that
    this bundle was not consolidated.  In addition to the evidence that was
    before the First-tier Tribunal the Appellant relied on a evidence  from
    his mother, a medical certificate relating  to  his  wife  and  further
    background evidence relating to Sri Lanka. I expressed concern  at  the
    manner in which the Appellant's solicitors prepared their client's case
    for the substantive hearing.

6.   The Appellant's evidence is in his witness  statement  at  page  61  of
    "consolidated" bundle.  In addition,  he  gave  evidence  in  Sinhalese
    through an interpreter.  His evidence can be summarised.   He  is  from
    Colombo.  His mother  and  sister  live  in  Colombo.   His  father  is
    deceased.  The Appellant worked in various jobs in  Sri  Lanka  in  the
    hospitality industry.  He has qualifications  up  to  A  level  and  he
    completed a diploma in Computer Studies and Hotel Management.   In  May
    2002 he was employed in a managerial role in  a  nightclub  in  Colombo
    called "Royal Boss".  He had 30 to 40 members of  staff  working  under
    him.  He would from time to  time  recruit  new  members  of  staff  by
    advertising in newspapers. He asked applicants to send  their  CVs  and
    interviews would be arranged.  There would be security checks.  A check
    would be made with the village headman of a village where an  applicant
    came from and that  person  would  be  asked  to  provide  a  character
    certificate.  An applicant's national ID card  was  checked  to  ensure
    that they were over 18 and nationals of Sri Lanka.  In December 2009 or
    early January 2010 the  Appellant  placed  advertisements  for  various
    positions. A person  came  forward,  TG.  He  was  from  a  village  in
    Vavuniya.  An interview took place and security  checks  completed.  TG
    was hired as a cleaner on a three- month probationary period.

7.   In April 2010 TG asked for a week off work to visit  his  family.   The
    Appellant agreed to him having three days off because  it  was  a  busy
    time.  TG did not return  after  three  days.  On  the  fifth  day  the
    Appellant called him on his mobile but was unable to contact with  him.
    The day after that  the  Appellant  called  a  landline  number  having
    checked his file. He made contact using this number with TG's  parents.
    They informed the Appellant that they had seen TG two days earlier, but
    that they had not seen his since then.  The Appellant called again on 2
    May 2010 and spoke to TG's father.  He told  the  Appellant  that  TG's
    body had been found in a well.

8.   TG was a hard worker and the Appellant had helped him  when  he  needed
    money.  TG had come to the Appellant's home and done some painting  for
    him. The Appellant thought  that  he  was  a  trustworthy  and  genuine
    person.  Following the news of his death,  the  Appellant  arranged  to
    visit TG 's home and the hospital where TG's body was.  This was a five-
     hour journey.  He saw  that  TG  had  been  shot  in  the  head.   The
    Appellant  gave  money  to  his  family  to  help  with   the   funeral
    arrangements.  TG's father told the Appellant that the funeral was on 5
    May 2010.  The Appellant was told by his boss to give the  family  some
    money.  Around 25 people from  the  nightclub  went  by  coach  to  the
    funeral.

9.   On 7 May 2010 four CID officers attended the Appellant's workplace  and
    showed him their ID.  He was questioned for about two hours in  a  room
    at the nightclub.  He was asked how he knew TG, how he had  been  hired
    and what checks had been done on him.  The Appellant told them.  On  10
    May 2010 six different CID officers attended the Appellant's  home  and
    they searched the property.  They did not find anything.  However,  the
    Appellant was taken away in a van, beaten and accused of being an  LTTE
    supporter.  He was blindfolded and held down.  He did not see where  he
    was taken.  They told him that he was a dirty, Sinhalese person who had
    helped the LTTE.  He was accused of being an LTTE member and of sending
    money to the LTTE from the nightclub.  He was accused of allowing  LTTE
    members to come to the club and giving them jobs at the club.   He  was
    detained for seven days.  After seven days on 17 May 2010, he was taken
    to Fort Magistrates' Court in Colombo. The Appellant  did  not  have  a
    lawyer.  He  denied  the  allegations,  he  was  remanded  in  custody,
    handcuffed by prison officers and taken to Wellikada  Prison  where  he
    was detained for fourteen days.  He was able to bribe one of the prison
    guards to allow the Appellant to contact his mother and on 18 May  2010
    his mother, brother-in-law and friend came to visit him in prison.  His
    friend returned with a lawyer.  During his stay at Wellikada Prison  he
    was told that if he told the truth about the LTTE they would help  him.
    He  was  not  beaten  during  his  time  there.   He  returned  to  the
    Magistrates' Court on 31 May 2010. He was represented by his lawyer who
    helped him get bail.  A surety of 3 lakhs was paid and his fingerprints
    were taken.  He was released subject to reporting at his  local  police
    station on the first Monday of every month.  His lawyer told  him  that
    the  case  against  him  would  continue.   When  the   Appellant   was
    interviewed by the Home Office he did not have court documents. He  has
    since obtained these with the assistance of his lawyer.

10.  The Appellant's employment was terminated.   The  Appellant  approached
    an agent with a view to leaving Sri Lanka. The agent said that he would
    not be able to get a visa for the Appellant in his own right, but if he
    was able to marry an application could be made for his wife to study in
    the UK and the Appellant could be her dependant.  The Appellant did not
    explain to his girlfriend what the agent said, but she consented to  go
    abroad in any event. She had been planning to study abroad.   She  told
    him this before they were married.  They have known  each  other  since
    2005.  The Appellant's wife applied for a passport which was issued  on
    5 July 2010.  They married on 21  July  2010.   His  wife  was  working
    before they married.  They gave the agent  their  marriage  certificate
    and wife's education certificates so that an application could be made.

11.  On 2 August 2010 the Appellant reported at the police station.  He  was
    detained and transferred to another detention centre where he was  held
    for 53 days and questioned on average four times a day.   He  was  told
    that he had weapons and that he had sent  money  to  the  LTT.  He  was
    accused of helping LTTE members from abroad.  He  was  tortured  daily.
    This included having a rope tied around his wrists  and  being  dragged
    across the floor.  He was kicked, hit and burned  with  cigarettes.  He
    still has burn marks on the  back  of  his  left  hand.   Most  of  the
    injuries did not  leave  permanent  scarring,  although  the  Appellant
    described having to struggle when lifting with his right  shoulder  and
    pain in his lower back.   On 24 September 2010 he was taken  to  court.
    His lawyer was there.  His family paid 5 lakhs and  his  brother-in-law
    had to sign before bail was granted on the same conditions  as  before,
    to report on the first Monday of every month.

12.   The  Appellant's  student  application  was  successful.  Visas   were
    received in December 2010.  Because there was a pending court case  the
    Appellant could not go through the airport  without  help.   The  agent
    said he knew someone at passport control at the airport and this person
    met the Appellant at the  agent's  office.  For  payment  he  told  the
    Appellant to come to his counter at the airport and he  would  let  him
    through.   There was no problem going through the airport  at  Colombo.
    They arrived at Heathrow Airport on 26 December  2010.   The  Appellant
    did not claim asylum at the airport because he did not know  about  the
    process.  He was focused on getting to safety. He knew  that  they  had
    visas valid until 8 May 2013.  His  wife  enrolled  at  Fulham  Chelsea
    College and the Appellant secured employment for  the  Slug  &  Lettuce
    Restaurant and later DHL.  Their daughter was born on 3  January  2013.
    The Appellant made a claim for asylum on 25 August 2015.

13.  The Appellant's evidence is that the police  have  been  to  his  house
    asking about his whereabouts.  A warrant has been issued for his arrest
    and it is not safe for him to  return  to  Sri  Lanka.   The  Appellant
    clarified his evidence relating to these visits.  The first visit  took
    place at his mother's home in  March  2011.   Two  people  in  civilian
    clothing came to the home  asking  his  mother  about  the  Appellant's
    whereabouts.  He was not in the country at  that  time.   There  was  a
    second visit but he cannot remember when this took place. He  describes
    his mother being "scolded" by  the  visitors.   They  asked  about  the
    Appellant's whereabouts and said he was an LTTE supporter.  The  second
    visit took place about five to six months after the first. The visitors
    were different to those who visited on  the  first  occasion.   Between
    2011 and September 2018 when the last visit took place,  there  were  a
    number of visits.  As a result of this his mother went to live with the
    Appellant's sister. She returns to the family home from time  to  time.
    She was present during  approximately  six  visits.  Neighbours  report
    visits when she has not been there.

14.  The nightclub closed down about a year ago and the  Appellant  believes
    that whoever took over from him must have had a  similar  problem.   He
    has not been in contact with anyone other than his mother and sister in
    Sri Lanka.  He came to the UK in order to  hide  because  there  was  a
    threat on his life and does not want to make public his whereabouts.

15   The Appellant's wife, DD, gave evidence.  Her evidence is contained  in
    her witness statement of 8 June 2016.  She adopted  that  statement  as
    her evidence-in-chief and was asked  supplementary  questions  and  was
    cross-examined.  Her evidence can be  summarised.   She  has  read  her
    husband's statement and insofar as matters are  within  her  knowledge,
    they are correct and true.  They first met in 2005 when  the  Appellant
    was working at a nightclub called "Royal Boss".  In May  or  June  2010
    the Appellant suggested that they should go abroad.  They were planning
    at that time to get married.  She agreed to this.  She was not aware of
    his problems with the authorities.  After the marriage on 21 July  2010
    the Appellant was arrested on 2 August 2010.  His family were  able  to
    secure bail for him on 24 September 2010.  She received a student  visa
    in the first week of December 2010.  They  arrived  in  the  UK  on  26
    December 2010.  Since they have been in the  UK  the  authorities  have
    been looking for her husband and a warrant  has  been  issued  for  his
    arrest.

16.  In oral evidence she described the Appellant  after  his  arrest  on  2
    August  2010  and  how  he  was  in  pain,  anxious  and  scared.   The
    Appellant's mother  says  that  there  are  frequent  visits  from  the
    authorities looking for the Appellant.  She  did  not  know  about  her
    husband's problems until after they married.   She  confirms  that  her
    passport was issued on 5 July.  At the time she consented to go  abroad
    she was not aware of the Appellant's  problems.    Her  family  in  Sri
    Lanka has not been approached concerning her husband's whereabouts. Her
    husband's sister's husband stood as surety.

17.  I heard submissions.  Mr Walker  relied  on  the  Reasons  for  Refusal
    Letter confirming that this was the refusal of 21 January 2016 (and not
    a letter which he referred to dated 22  January  2016).   He  submitted
    that there were concerns about the Appellant's credibility  because  of
    the delay in making the application.   The  Appellant  has  never  been
    linked to the LTTE.  He is not a member or  supporter.   His  claim  is
    without merit.

18.  Ms Seehara relied  on  her  skeleton  argument  and  she  made  further
    submissions.  She said that the Appellant has complied  with  his  duty
    under paragraph 339L of the Immigration Rules.   She  referred  to  the
    what  she  described  as  limited  Reasons  for  Refusal  Letter.   She
    submitted that it was accepted by Ms Ahmad at the error of law  hearing
    that the FTT erred in attaching weight  to  the  document  verification
    report relating to the documents submitted by the Appellant in  support
    of court proceedings in Sri Lanka.  She referred me to the case  of  VT
    (Article 22 Procedures Directive - confidentiality)  Sri  Lanka  [2017]
    UKUT  00368  and  the  more  recent  case  of  PA  (protection   claim:
    Respondent's  enquiries;  bias)  Bangladesh  [2018]  UKUT  0337.    She
    submitted that no weight could be attached to the document verification
    report because to verify the documents the  Respondent  made  enquiries
    with the actors of persecution.  She referred me to a document at pages
    48 to 52 of the Appellant's bundle and a document which shows that  the
    Appellant's solicitors invited the Respondent to go  through  a  lawyer
    appointed by the High Commission to verify the documents.  She referred
    me specifically to paragraphs 86,  87,  90,  91  and  92  of  VT.   She
    referred me to the evidence of the Appellant's lawyer at page 73 of the
    bundle and submitted that this has not been challenged by the Secretary
    of State.  She referred me specifically to the documents that have been
    submitted by the Appellant including a detention order at  page  82  of
    the Appellant's bundle and the arrest warrant at page 103. She drew  my
    attention to the evidence from family members at pages 109 and  111  of
    the Appellant's bundle and a document at page 135  of  the  Appellant's
    bundle concerning background evidence relating to  exiting  Sri  Lanka.
    She submitted that the Appellant left Sri Lanka before the issue of the
    warrant.  The warrant of arrest is at page 103 and is dated 17  January
    2011, by which time the Appellant was in the UK.

19.  In terms of the delay in making a claim, Ms Seehara submitted that  the
    Appellant had lawful leave here until 2015.  It is credible that he did
    not have to focus on a protection claim.  He  did  not  need  to  worry
    about it.  She  referred  to  the  Appellant's  mother's  letter  which
    corroborates continuing interest and what the  Appellant  said  in  his
    asylum interview about post-flight visits to his  mother's  home.   She
    relied on the Court of Appeal case of ME (Sri Lanka) v The Secretary of
    State for the Home  Department  [2018]  EWCA  Civ  1486  with  specific
    reference to paragraph 16 which reads as follows:-

         "The following are, in my judgment,  the  pertinent  points.   ME's
         arrest took place long after the cessation of the conflict  in  Sri
         Lanka.  That led (or ought to have led) to the conclusion  that  he
         was perceived at that time as being of significant interest to  the
         authorities.  He  was  therefore  a  person  who  had  fallen  into
         category (a) of the risk categories identified in GJ. It would have
         needed an exceptionally strong case to persuade the FTT that he had
         now ceased to be at risk.  The  mere  fact  that  he  was  released
         without charge and without reporting restrictions was  not  enough,
         because the authorities not only made two subsequent visits to  his
         home; but they also searched it.  The  conclusion  that  should  be
         drawn from that is that  ME  was  still  a  person  of  significant
         interest; and moreover, that  the  authorities  perceived  that  he
         might have more to tell them.  Mr Jolliffe, in support of the FTT's
         decision, submitted that ME was no  longer  a  person  of  interest
         because the authorities had got what they  wanted  from  him.   But
         that does not explain why, having obtained the information from  ME
         about the location of one arms cache, the authorities  nevertheless
         twice visited his home and searched it.  Thus, the FTT was right to
         proceed  on  the  basis  that  there  was  a  real  risk  that  the
         authorities would wish to question him further."

20.  Ms Seehara referred me to the background  evidence,  specifically  that
    at 155 of the Appellant's bundle, namely, the US  Department  of  State
    2017 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices:  Sri  Lanka,  20  April
    2018 and the  Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for  Human
    Rights (OHCHR), Report of the Special Rapporteur on the  promotion  and
    protection of human rights while countering terrorism: Mission  to  Sri
    Lanka (Advance Unedited Version); 23 July  2018  at  page  163  of  the
    bundle.

Conclusions

21.  This case turns on credibility.  The Secretary of State made  a  number
    of significant concessions in the decision letter. It is accepted  that
    he was employed as claimed by the nightclub and that in respect of  his
    employment  he  gave  a  "detailed  account"   which   is   "internally
    consistent." The same is said about his evidence concerning TG.  It  is
    accepted that the Appellant hired TG and that he was found dead.

22.  In relation to the Appellant's  arrest  and  detention  the  Respondent
    said this:

         "It is also noted you were asked whether  you  had  any  supporting
         evidence and you stated that you would try to obtain  it  from  Sri
         Lanka (AIR q. 107).  However, to date, no such supporting  evidence
         has been received.  Consequently this aspect of your claim has been
         found uncertain and consideration will  be  given  to  whether  the
         benefit of the doubt should be applied in the light of your general
         credibility  and  other  factors,  under  paragraph  339L  of   the
         Immigration Rules" (see paragraph 26 of  the  Reasons  for  Refusal
         Letter).

23.  Later in the letter the Respondent under the heading  "Benefit  of  the
    doubt" concluded at paragraph 27  that  the  Appellant  had  failed  to
    satisfy paragraph 339L (iv) which reads:

         "... the person has made an asylum claim  or  sought  to  establish
         that he is a person eligible for humanitarian protection or made  a
         human rights claim at the earliest possible time, unless the person
         can demonstrate good reason for not having done so;"

    The Respondent took into account  that  the  Appellant  did  not  claim
    asylum at the earliest opportunity when he arrived in the UK on 21 July
    2010. He did not claim asylum until 25 August 2015.  The  reason  given
    in his interview was that he did not know  anything  about  asylum  and
    this was not considered to be a reasonable explanation bearing in  mind
    that the Appellant is an educated man.  It was thus concluded that  the
    Appellant was not at risk on return to Sri Lanka.


24.  It is  agreed  by  the  Respondent  that  a  significant  part  of  the
    Appellant's account is credible up until his initial arrest on  10  May
    2010.  Looking  at  the  Reasons  for  Refusal  Letter  the  Respondent
    accepted TG's connection with the LTTE and that  after  his  death  CID
    officers attended the nightclub and questioned the  Appellant  for  two
    hours.  The Appellant  and  his  wife  have  given  broadly  consistent
    evidence about the second arrest.  The Appellant's evidence about  both
    arrests is internally consistent.  In addition, to support his evidence
    he has submitted a significant amount of documentary evidence  relating
    to court proceedings in Sri Lanka and an arrest warrant.  Mr Walker did
    not draw my attention to any inconsistencies in those documents and  in
    terms of their reliability and the document verification report he drew
    my attention to what Ms Ahmad said at the error of law hearing.

25.      I asked Mr Walker whether his position is that no weight  could  be
    attached to that document in the light of VT and what Ms  Ahmad  stated
    at the error of  law  hearing.   He  did  not  make  clear  to  me  the
    Respondent's position about this piece of evidence. Equally he did  not
    however seek to argue that I  should  attach  weight  to  the  document
    verification report.

26.    The document verification report on  which  the  Secretary  of  State
    relies relates to the arrest warrant and not the other documents relied
    on by the Appellant.  Checks were made by the Respondent directly  with
    the CID in Sri Lanka and it was argued  that  there  was  a  breach  of
    confidentiality and that in any event the checks  were  not  impartial.
    Ms Ahmad's position at the error of law hearing is set out at paragraph
    27 of my decision as follows:

         "... She [Ms Ahmad] accepted following VT that the judge erred when
         considering the reliability of the DVR but  that  this  was  not  a
         matter that I needed to consider unless I find that the  judge  had
         erred in respect of credibility."

27.  In the light of the evidence as a whole and taking into account  VT,  I
    have to consider what weight can be placed on a document emanating from
    an alleged actor of persecution.  In the light of the circumstances  of
    this case, I conclude that the  document  verification  report  is  not
    reliable and the arrest warrant and other documents (which are not  the
    subject of the report) are.  I take into Ms Ahmad's  concession  (which
    Mr Walker did not seek in any meaningful way to go behind) and that the
    Appellant and his wife's evidence is broadly consistent.  I  take  into
    account all material circumstances including  the  delay  in  making  a
    claim (which I deal  with  below).    I  accept  the  evidence  of  the
    Appellant and his wife and the supporting evidence from his mother  and
    lawyer. There was no challenge of substance to this evidence.

28.  The main attack to the  Appellant's  credibility  on  which  Mr  Walker
    focused was Section 8 of the 2004 Act.  There has, by any account, been
    a significant delay by the Appellant in making a claim for  asylum.   I
    remind myself that when Section 8 applies, as it does in this  case,  I
    should look at the evidence as a whole.  I can understand that he  felt
    safe in the knowledge that he had leave to remain here.  However, I  am
    not particularly impressed by the Appellant's explanation, namely  that
    he was not aware of asylum. However, this in my view is  the  strongest
    part of the Respondent's case (indeed it was the focus of  Mr  Walker's
    submissions before me) and it should not be  treated  as  the  starting
    point of an assessment of credibility: SM (Section 8:  Judge's process)
    Iran [2005]  UKAIT  00116.   Having  taken  into  account  all  of  the
    evidence, I conclude that the delay is not  fatal  to  the  Appellant's
    credibility.  Having accepted the Appellant's credibility I  find  that
    he was arrested and detained on two occasions. I  accept  his  evidence
    that there is a  warrant  outstanding  for  his  arrest  and  that  CID
    officers have since he fled Sri Lanka attended  his  mother's  home  to
    look for him.  It follows that the Appellant should he  return  to  Sri
    Lanka would be at risk of arrest on the basis of his perceived  support
    of the LTTE as a result of his involvement with TG.  He falls into  the
    risk identified in GJ (Post -civil war: returnees) Sri Lanka CG  [2013]
    UKUT 319 because there is and extant arrest warrant and so it is likely
    that he will be on a stop  list  accessible  at  the  airport.   Having
    accepted the Appellant's account in its entirety and that he is in fear
    of the authorities, there would be no  sufficiency  of  protection  and
    relocation would not be a viable option for  him.   Ms  Seehara  stated
    that there was no discrete Article 8 claim
