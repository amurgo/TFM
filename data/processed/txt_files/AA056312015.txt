Representation:

For the appellant:     Ms G Kiai, instructed by Bindmans LLP
For the respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, ARM, with assessed date of birth 21.11.94, is a  citizen
    of Iran.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Hawden-Beal promulgated 13.7.15, dismissing on all grounds  his  appeal
    against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State,  dated  12.3.15,  to
    refuse his asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights claims  and
    to remove him from the UK.  The Judge heard the appeal on 6.7.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Foudy refused permission to appeal on 8.9.15.
    However, when the application was renewed to the Upper Tribunal,  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Coker granted permission to appeal on 23.11.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 19.2.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 5. When first mentioned with all other cases  listed  at  10:10,  Ms  Kiai
    indicated that she was not quite ready  and  the  appellant's  previous
    representatives had not passed on their bundle.  She  had  borrowed  Mr
    Tufan's copy of the Secretary of State's bundle  and  sought  that  the
    case be taken last to enable her to complete preparation  for  hearing.
    When the case was called back on at 11:49 Ms Kiai  indicated  that  she
    was ready to proceed.

Error of Law

 6. For the reasons set out below I find no material error of  law  in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such  as  to  require
    the decision of Judge Hawden-Beal to be set aside.

 7.  Although  Judge  Foudy  considered  the  grounds  of  application  for
    permission to appeal no more  than  a  disagreement  with  the  judge's
    findings, in  granting  permission  to  appeal  Judge  Coker  found  it
    arguable that  "the  judge  failed  to  have  adequate  regard  to  the
    appellant's age when he left Iran, when he  was  screened  and  in  his
    witness statements given that he was  an  adult  at  the  date  of  the
    hearing. It is arguable that had he considered the appellant's age, his
    conclusions as to credibility may have been different."

 8. The appellant arrived in the UK on 30.3.12, having left Iran  some  7-8
    months earlier, and claimed asylum on 23.5.12, asserting that he was 14
    years of age. His screening interview took place the same day. A  first
    age assessment by Hertfordshire  Children's  Services  in  April  2012,
    prior to the asylum claim,  accepted  his  claimed  date  of  birth  of
    21.11.97. However, in interview he gave a different  age  and  date  of
    birth of 9.1.98. A further age assessment was undertaken in June  2014,
    with the conclusion that he was then 19 years of age  with  a  date  of
    birth of 21.11.94.

 9. At appears at �29 of the  refusal  decision,  the  Secretary  of  State
    concluded that the appellant was "not a minor" when he claimed  asylum,
    being over 17 years and 6 months, and was 20 years of age at  the  date
    of the refusal decision. At the date of the asylum interview  in  March
    2013 he was certainly over the age of 18 and was fully able  to  answer
    questions put to him. That he was "not a minor" was taken into  account
    in the Secretary of State's assessment  of  his  credibility.  Strictly
    speaking he was still a minor, being under the age of 18,  but  as  has
    been pointed out there is no 'bright line' between the maturity  of  an
    older child and that of an adult because of age. It is also relevant to
    point out that the date of  birth  is  an  assessment  and  must  of  a
    necessity be an approximation and not a precision of the date of birth.

10. At �26 of the decision, after  considering  the  two  age  assessments,
    Judge Hawden-Beal was satisfied that at the date of the appeal  hearing
    the appellant was an adult. The judge  then  proceeded  to  assess  the
    evidence  of  the  appellant's  claim,   noting   several   significant
    inconsistencies, and reaching the view at �33 that the appellant "is  a
    complete stranger to the truth and that this claim  is  a  fabrication.
    This young man is an adult who has attempted to manipulate  the  asylum
    system for his own ends and has been caught out by a complete  lack  of
    consistency in his claim." At �35 the  judge  concluded,  "I  therefore
    find that his claim lacks credibility and am satisfied that he  is  not
    wanted by the authorities for anything and will not  be  at  risk  upon
    return. He has not discharged the burden of having a well-founded  fear
    of persecution for any convention reason and therefore does not qualify
    as a refugee."

11. In summary, the grounds of application for permission to appeal and  as
    amplified by Ms Kiai's  able  submissions  argue  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge failed to take into account that  the  appellant  was  a
    minor when the events he described  occurred  in  Iran,  and  when  his
    screening interview took place. It is further submitted that the  judge
    erred in rejecting the first age assessment but at the same  time  made
    findings based on it.

12. The grounds point to 'UNHCR Refugee Children: Guidelines for Protection
    and Care,' suggesting there should be  a  liberal  application  of  the
    principle of the benefit of the doubt. Further reliance  is  placed  on
    the ILPA Guidelines for best practice  on  working  with  children  and
    young people, and on GM (Risk on Return  -  Family)  DRC  [2002]  UKAIR
    06741, where the  applicant  was  17  years  of  age  at  the  date  of
    interview, the  Tribunal  urged  caution  before  drawing  any  adverse
    inferences from omissions or discrepancies in the interview.

13. The ILPA Guidelines state that, "Children and  young  people  may  also
    struggle to understand the significance of certain events, and so  fail
    to mention them when first interviewed. If such  details  emerge  under
    further questioning at the hearing,  the  credibility  of  the  child's
    account should not be undermined."

14. However, in this case the appellant was 18 and an adult at the date  of
    his asylum  interview.  It  appears  that  little  from  his  screening
    interview, when he was still 17, was relied on as containing omissions.
    There are discrepancies, such as having given an address for his father
    in the screening interview, yet later he revealed that his  father  had
    been dead for 7-8 years. Such discrepancies are not such  that  can  be
    explained by immaturity or that are explicable by confusion, or  memory
    problems, or any other issues that might be attributed to being  child.



15. Further, this was not a case where the appellant may have forgotten  to
    mention certain  events  in  an  earlier  account.  In  the  main,  the
    inconsistencies relied on by the First-tier Tribunal Judge were  direct
    and stark contradictions between one account and another, accounts that
    were mutually inconsistent. The appellant did not  claim  that  he  had
    forgotten or did not  understand  the  significance  of  parts  of  his
    account. In fact, as the judge  noted  at  �32  of  the  decision,  the
    appellant's explanation for the discrepancies is that he claimed he was
    told not to tell the truth, for various reasons, including that he  had
    been fingerprinted in other countries. He said it  was  only  later  on
    that he was told he would have to tell the truth if he wanted  to  stay
    in the UK. The judge took this explanation into  account  in  assessing
    the appellant's credibility. He thus admitted that he had not told  the
    truth about some aspects and clearly was able  to  distinguish  between
    truth and falsehood.

16. Ms Kiai's submissions focused more on a point of principle rather  than
    an assessment of the substance of the actual evidence before the judge.
    When in his submissions Mr Tufan referred to the  specific  content  of
    the evidential inconsistencies, Ms Kiai said she was not able  to  deal
    with those issues. For  example,  Mr  Tufan  referred  to  �33  of  the
    decision, where the judge pointed out  that  the  appellant  could  not
    decide if his father is alive or not; which uncle he  left  Iran  with;
    what cousins he has in the UK; whether or  not  he  has  contacted  his
    family since arriving in the UK; or  whether  he  knows  their  contact
    details. As stated above, the appellant admitted that he had been  told
    not to tell the truth. Mr Tufan submitted that  given  the  extent  and
    nature of discrepancies and inconsistencies in his evidence, giving the
    appellant the benefit of any doubt would have made no difference to the
    conclusions and thus any failure to accord  greater  attention  to  the
    appellant's immature age when in Iran  or  when  giving  his  screening
    interview was immaterial to the outcome of the appeal.

17. Ms Kiai explained that she had not had time to consider the  detail  of
    the evidence as she had not had the Secretary of State's  bundle  prior
    to the hearing. I passed her a copy of the core bundle, which  contains
    the Secretary of State's bundle (she had earlier borrowed  that  of  Mr
    Tufan), and I agreed to allow her a further period of time to  consider
    the point raised by Mr Tufan further and make any  further  submissions
    she wished on this discrete point.

18. She  returned  to  the  hearing  later  in  the  day  and  made  cogent
    submissions, to the effect that the  alleged  inconsistencies  were  in
    respect of areas where the  benefit  of  the  doubt  should  have  been
    accorded to the appellant. For example, she pointed to �29 & �33  where
    the judge relied on the  fact  that  the  appellant  gave  inconsistent
    accounts in failing to  mention  that  his  father  was  dead  in  some
    accounts, but not others. His explanation  was  that  where  it  wasn't
    mentioned he wasn't asked. However, as  the  judge  pointed  out,  this
    discrepancy is more than not being asked or having  failed  to  mention
    because he  didn't  know  he  should  have  done.  In  his  second  age
    assessment, his SEF and witness statements, he positively  stated  that
    he lived with his father, mother, brother and sister. Further at Q25 of
    his asylum interview he asserted that the person he lived with was  his
    father and not his step-father. In this, and in respect  of  her  other
    specific responses to this issue, Ms Kiai was unable  to  identify  how
    the discrepancy could be explained or accounted for  by  the  youth  or
    immaturity of the appellant, or giving the appellant the benefit of the
    doubt.

19. I have carefully considered Ms Kiai's submissions and  the  nature  and
    content of the discrepancies relied on by both the Secretary  of  State
    and the First-tier Tribunal Judge. Whilst the judge should perhaps have
    demonstrated within the body of the decision that he taken  account  of
    the appellant's youth, I am not satisfied that on the particular  facts
    of  this  case  and  the  number  and  extent  of   discrepancies   and
    inconsistencies relied on any caution,  allowance,  or  giving  of  the
    benefit of the doubt for the appellant's youth when either  17  or  18,
    would or could have made any difference to the  credibility  assessment
    and ultimately outcome of the appeal and thus any error in this  regard
    is  immaterial  to  the  outcome  of  the  appeal.  There  were   stark
    differences in accounts, as the judge explained at �35 of the decision.
    In my view, these could not be accounted for or  reconciled  by  making
    allowance for immaturity, or giving the benefit of the doubt because of
    immaturity. To do as suggested by Ms Kiai, the judge would have had  to
    simply accept the appellant's case in its entirety, as if unchallenged,
    and to ignore all discrepancies and inconsistencies. That cannot be the
    correct approach.

20. Further, I find no error of law disclosed in the judge's assessment  of
    the two age assessments. The judge  has  provided  cogent,  justifiable
    reasons for accepting the second assessment as to the appellant's  age.
    There is nothing improper or inconsistent in the judge  taking  account
    of what was said by the appellant in that first age  assessment  as  to
    why he came to the UK, as set out at �34 of the decision.

Conclusions:

21. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Pickup

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal made an order.
Given the circumstances, I continue the anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
