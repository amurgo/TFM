Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr M Hasan, Solicitor, Kalam Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Miss J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of two Bangladeshi  citizens  who  at  the  material
    times were both minors.  They are brother and sister, [RM] was born  on
    13 September 1998 and his sister was born on 7 March 2002.  At the time
    of the decision that I made following a hearing at Field  House  on  17
    September 2015 they were 17 and 13  respectively.   They  sought  entry
    clearance to join their parents who are their sponsors  in  the  United
    Kingdom with their two younger siblings.  Both were refused by an Entry
    Clearance Officer's decision made on 19 February 2014.

 2. When the matter came before me on 17 September 2015 I found that  there
    was an error of law.  I gave directions in paragraph 25 of my  decision
    in which I stated that I wanted to know  the  position  both  from  the
    Entry Clearance Officer, via the Presenting Officer, and I also  wanted
    to know the position from the appellants as to how they said  they  met
    the requirements of paragraphs 297(4) and (5) of the Immigration Rules.
    The relevant requirements are:

         Children


         Leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom as the  child  of  a
         parent, parents or a relative present and settled or being admitted
         for settlement in the United Kingdom

         297. The requirements to be met  by  a  person  seeking  indefinite
         leave to enter the United Kingdom as the child of a parent, parents
         or a relative present and settled or being admitted for  settlement
         in the United Kingdom are that he:
             (iv) can, and will, be accommodated adequately by the  parent,
             parents or relative the  child  is  seeking  to  join  without
             recourse to public funds in accommodation  which  the  parent,
             parents or relative the child  is  seeking  to  join,  own  or
             occupy exclusively; and
             (v)  can, and will, be maintained adequately  by  the  parent,
             parents, or relative the child is  seeking  to  join,  without
             recourse to public funds...

 3. In each case, the material consideration is  whether  the  presence  of
    these two children in the United Kingdom will increase  the  burden  on
    the public purse by their presence in the United Kingdom.  The starting
    point, and it is only a starting point, is the level of  earnings.   If
    the level of earnings is established, then it is common ground that  at
    the material time there was a surplus of something like just  over  �28
    per week. The precise figure is  �28.73  per  week  and  so  the  first
    question is whether or not the  sponsors  have  established  that  they
    earned at the relevant level.

 4. The documentation with which  I  have  been  provided  deals  with  the
    sources of income of both the husband, [M], and his wife who  is  known
    as [B].  It appears that the husband from the commencement of his  work
    on 1 August 2013 until the tax year ended 5 April 2014 was paid �5,552.
     The evidence of that is found in a letter from HM Revenue and  Customs
    dated 11 June 2014.  It provides a  series  of  reference  numbers  and
    national insurance numbers  and,  on  its  face,  it  is  the  original
    document that I have.  It is not a copy.

 5. On its face it establishes that was the relevant level of pay.  It  was
    that level of pay which was the basis upon which  the  calculation  was
    made and which provides the surplus of �28.73.   In  addition  to  that
    there was a P60 also for the tax year ended 5 April 2014 in the name of
    [M] showing the same national insurance number. We know that  P60s  are
    provided by employers and so one might properly look with some  caution
    at whether this is a genuine document, but it bears  exactly  the  same
    figure as the document from HM Revenue  and  Customs.   It  shows  that
    during the period the employer was able to produce a statement that [M]
    had earned �5,552.

 6. In addition to that there were a number  of  payslips.  Those  payslips
    were questioned by the Entry Clearance Officer and  quite  rightly  so,
    because they all showed exactly the same amount;  the  same  amount  of
    deductions and the same figure appeared month after month. There was  a
    four month period of payslips which  had  been  identified  covering  a
    period from November 2013 to February 2014 which showed identical  sums
    being paid each month. There  was  therefore  a  question  mark  as  to
    whether those documents were genuine.

 7. However since my original hearing there have been documents  that  have
    been provided.  In particular there is, at page 8  of  the  bundle,  an
    employment confirmation from Akash Restaurant, which is  where  [M]  is
    working,  showing  his  national  insurance   number,   the   date   of
    commencement and the fact that this is a part-time and permanent job as
    a cook.  He receives a basic salary of  �694  per  month  by  cash  for
    working 24 hours per week.

 8. All of those factors are consistent with the other documentation.  They
    are consistent with the form from HMRC showing  that  the  commencement
    was on 1 April  2013.   [M],  the  director  of  the  restaurant,  says
    importantly, all the payslips of [M] showed  the  exact  net  pay  each
    month because [M]'s salary does not attract  any  income  tax  and  his
    national insurance contribution does not vary. Furthermore [M]  is  not
    required to pay any income tax became his salary falls within  the  tax
    free personal allowance.  And one can see in the  relevant  payslips  a
    small amount of about �5 which is deducted by way of national insurance
    because his income marginally goes above the rate  for  which  national
    insurance is paid. Consequently the payslips (the  originals  of  which
    are available), the P60, (the original of which is before me), and  the
    letters from HM Revenue and Customs, all establish that  his  level  of
    income is that which he says he earns and which was the  basis  of  the
    calculation provided by the Entry Clearance Officer.

 9. Similar documentation is provided in relation to his wife.  Her  income
    is shown as being �6,300 per annum.  She too has got a letter from HMRC
    dated 6 January 2015 and shows that for a  company  called  Callingford
    Limited, where she works as a cleaner, she received �6,300 for the  tax
    year ended 5 April 2014. That is the tax year with which I am concerned
    and it shows a slight increase, an increase of only �60 per  year  from
    the previous annual tax return.  Once again I have  seen  the  original
    document from HM Revenue and Customs.  She too has  provided  a  letter
    from her employer. This at page 7 of the bundle before me and it  shows
    that Callingford Limited trading as X-Presslink Properties confirm that
    [B] has been working as a property cleaner since July 2011 and was paid
    �525 per month which equates with the �6,300 per annum; she is paid  in
    cash for 70 hours a month.   Her  payslips  do  not  vary  every  month
    because she is neither required to pay  any  income  tax  nor  national
    insurance contributions because her salary does not exceed the tax free
    personal allowance.  That is  what  the  evidence  was.   She  too  has
    provided payslips in the form that supports the claim that is made.

10. In those circumstances I am not prepared to find that  these  documents
    are forged or that they cannot be relied upon and it  establishes  that
    there is a level of income which is in excess of the sum of �28.73 over
    and above that which is the relevant benefit level.

11. It does not seem to me that the challenges made by the Entry  Clearance
    Officer are valid  insofar  as  there  was  an  attempt  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer previously to make deductions by way of contributions
    to utility bills.  For reasons that I gave in the error of law  finding
    on 18 September 2015 I do not accept that those deductions are properly
    made to reduce the benefits level below the surplus of �28.73.

12. There was also an issue as to whether the remaining  daughter,  whom  I
    understand is not a minor - a daughter remaining in Bangladesh - should
    have the sums of money that she receives or has received  in  the  past
    deducted.  It seems to me that where there is a contribution  which  is
    made which is not pursuant to a legal obligation,  the  fact  that  the
    parents have in the past contributed to assist [HB] does not mean  that
    their level of income is to be reduced to an extent such that  the  two
    appellants are not entitled to entry clearance.

13. In particular there is no evidence that  the  parents  were  paying  in
    excess of �28.73. Indeed if they had that amount of money to pay to the
    daughter and it was available to them and they were able to  pay,  then
    doubtless they would pay. That does not mean that  they  are  under  an
    obligation to pay.  I cannot  see  how,  if  they  were  to  apply  for
    benefits, they would be entitled to say "and by  the  way  our  benefit
    level must be increased because we make voluntary contributions to  our
    daughter in Bangladesh at a level which is such  that  we  require  the
    British tax payer to contribute to that voluntary payment we make".  So
    I cannot see that  the  benefits  they  pay  to  [HB]  will  materially
    increase the likelihood of further  recourse  to  public  funds.   That
    deals with the issue of maintenance.

14. I now come to the issue of  accommodation.   The  house  in  which  the
    children will live is a three bedroom property  with  a  sitting  room.
    That is treated as a four bedroom property and the material  which  has
    been provided by the respondent shows that this is to be treated as 7.5
    units and each person over the age of 10 is to be treated as a unit and
    anybody who is under the age of 10 is to be treated as half a unit.

15. The  calculations  therefore  are  that  the  sponsor's   two  children
    currently in the United Kingdom,  one  of  whom  was  at  the  date  of
    application 8 years old and possibly also at the date of decision. That
    child is only counted as half a unit.  The two sponsors are two  units.
    There is a son called Imran who is aged 23.  He  counts  as  a  further
    unit.  His two siblings, one of whom I have already mentioned, are  the
    sponsor's two children in the United Kingdom. The  two  appellants  are
    aged 17 and 13 respectively at the date of the  earlier  decision,  and
    they  therefore  attract  one  unit  each.   That  totals  6.5   units.
    Accordingly on the face of it the accommodation is suitable.

16. There is also a letter from an  inspection  officer,  Mr  Rahman,  from
    Signature Residentials. He says that  the  proposed  occupancy  of  the
    property will be seven people: 'In our professional view properties  of
    this size are fit to  accommodate  up  to  eight  people.'  He  may  be
    slightly wrong as to whether it  is  eight  or  whether  it  should  be
    properly treated as 7.5, but either way the accommodation is suitable.

17. We then come to consider whether or not the sponsors can meet the  cost
    of the accommodation without recourse to public funds by reason of  the
    presence of the appellants.  At the moment the rent is payable  at  the
    rate of �453 per month and that is payable not by the sponsors  but  by
    their son Imran and he discharges that as his contribution.  It is also
    recorded from the landlord that the rent is up to date.   There  is  no
    suggestion that housing benefit is payable in relation to any member of
    the family.  The document which certifies the payment of rent is  found
    at page 9 of the bundle and it simply confirms that  '[M]  owes  us  no
    rent for the above property because he has paid all the rent promptly.'



18. It does not seem to me that there is going to be an  additional  burden
    or recourse to further public funds.  My reason for  saying  it  is  as
    follows.  The appellants when they enter the United Kingdom will have a
    stamp on their passport which indicates that they are not  entitled  to
    further benefits and it is the practice, as  I  understand  it  to  be,
    that, were an application to be made for housing benefit to  the  local
    authority, the application would have to be supported  by  a  statement
    from the applicants indicating the relevant immigration status of those
    who are living in the property such  that  the  providers  of   housing
    benefit know whether housing benefit is payable.

19. It is my understanding from what the  parties  have  jointly  submitted
    that theses two appellants will not have  a  passport  which  indicates
    that they are entitled to recourse to public funds  and  accordingly  I
    cannot see the way upon which there will be further recourse to  public
    funds even if an application were made on the part of the sponsors.  It
    must surely be the case  that  some  investigation  is  made  by  those
    providing housing benefit from public funds  that  the  eligibility  of
    those in the house to receive public funding is considered.   Since  it
    is clear that the two appellants are not  entitled  to  receive  public
    funds by way of housing benefit or in any other form, I do not see  how
    their presence can materially increase the recourse to public funds.

NOTICE OF DECISION

20. In these circumstances I  consider  that  the  requirements  for  entry
    clearance have been made out and accordingly I allow the appeal.
