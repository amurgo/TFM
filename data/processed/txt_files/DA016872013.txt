Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms B Smith, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr J Parkinson, HOPO


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant has been granted permission to  appeal  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal (consisting of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  A  W
    Khan and Mr A P  Richardson  JP)  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent to deport him to Barbados.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Barbados born  on  1  January  1987.   He
    arrived in the UK on 7 September 2004 with a valid visit visa  for  six
    months.  On 1 November 2004 he applied for indefinite leave  to  remain
    as the child of a settled parent, namely his mother.   His  application
    was refused on 9 April 2005 and he appealed against this decision.  His
    appeal was allowed on 7 July  2005.   Subsequently  the  appellant  was
    granted indefinite leave to remain on 31 August 2005.

3.   On 16 September 2011, the appellant  was  convicted  at  Reading  Crown
    Court for possession with intent  to  supply  class  A  drugs.   On  14
    October 2011, he was sentenced to six years' imprisonment.  On 2 August
    2013 the appellant was made the subject of a deportation order  in  the
    light of his conviction and  liability  to  deportation  under  the  UK
    Borders Act 2007.  The drugs had a street value of over �8,000.

4.   The Tribunal heard oral evidence from the appellant,  his  mother,  Mrs
    Paula Williams, his  partner  Sabrina  Johnson,  his  partner's  mother
    Beverley Johnson, his half-sister  Deniesha  Williams,  and  his  half-
    brother Jamal Bovell, most of whom had  submitted  witness  statements.
    The  Tribunal  also  had  the  Pre-sentencing  report  and  the   OASys
    assessment dated 20 December 2013.

5.   In looking at the facts of  this  case,  the  Tribunal  took  as  their
    starting point the  appellant's  offence  and  the  judge's  sentencing
    remarks.  He found that he was convicted of a serious offence, being in
    possession of a  considerable  quantity  of  drugs  namely  heroin  and
    cocaine which were not for his personal use.  He had pleaded guilty  to
    possession with intent to supply, the total  street  value  being  over
    �8,000. The judge said in the sentencing remarks that the appellant was
    not a drug user but was intending to sell for his own profit.   He  was
    not of good previous character as he had two cautions and a  conviction
    for simple possession of cannabis.  His explanation that he  discovered
    the drugs by chance and saw an opportunity to sell them for profit  was
    rejected.  The only mitigation, apart from the plea of guilty, was that
    he owed �600 in rent.   The  Sentencing  Judge  said  the  offence  was
    significantly  above  the  level  of  selling  a  couple  of  wraps  to
    undercover  officers  on  more  than  one  occasion  which  would  have
    attracted four to five years after a plea of guilty.  The quantity  and
    value was very much greater.

6.   The Tribunal said that at the heart of  this  appeal  was  whether  the
    appellant's family and private life should  outweigh  his  deportation.
    On the one hand, there was the gravity of the offending  behaviour  and
    on the other hand, there was the positive probation report,  assessment
    of a low risk of reoffending and the appellant's constructive  time  in
    prison where he has obtained a number  of  educational  qualifications.
    He has attended a drugs awareness and thinking skills course  and  that
    his drug tests were all negative.

7.   The Tribunal gave credit to the appellant in attending various  courses
    whilst in prison and the presentence report assessed his likelihood  of
    reconviction as low as confirmed by the OASys Report and the  appellant
    accepted that he intended to sell the drugs for  financial  gain.   The
    report noted that the appellant did not consider  the  consequences  of
    his actions and he focused solely on his own needs  when  he  committed
    the index offence.  Contrary to what they were told, the appellant  was
    not a person of previous good character.  He had  two  cautions  and  a
    conviction for possession of cannabis.  The OASys  Report  states  that
    the appellant justified this offence stating that the cannabis was  for
    his own use and he did not think that he did anything wrong.

8.   The Tribunal accepted in relation to the appellant's family  life  that
    he has been in a relationship with Miss Johnson.  But  clearly  he  did
    not think about the consequences of his actions.  If he had stopped and
    thought about what he was doing, he must have  realised  the  co-called
    ripple effect upon her, members of her family and also members  of  his
    family.  The Tribunal found  that  this  demonstrated  faulty  thinking
    skills and that  the  appellant  was  solely  motivated  by  profit  in
    intending to sell the drugs.

9.   The Tribunal said they had taken into account the evidence of  all  the
    witnesses and listened  with  great  care  to  what  they  had  to  say
    regarding the effect upon them were the appellant  to  be  deported  to
    Barbados.  In relation to Miss Johnson, she is a British  citizen,  her
    family are in the UK, she has her own accommodation and is working in a
    stable job.   The  Tribunal  accepted  that  paragraph  399(b)  of  the
    Immigration Rules applies in that the appellant does have a genuine and
    subsisting relationship with Miss Johnson but  the  appellant  has  not
    lived in the UK with valid leave continuously for at least the  fifteen
    years immediately  preceding  the  date  of  the  immigration  decision
    (discounting any period of imprisonment) and they  did  not  find  that
    there are insurmountable obstacles to family  life  with  Miss  Johnson
    continuing outside the UK.  A Tribunal found  that  the  parties  could
    keep in touch with each other and Miss Johnson could visit Barbados  if
    she chose to do so.  While they accepted that it may well  not  be  her
    choice to go and live in Barbados  for  practical  considerations,  the
    gravity of the appellant's offending behaviour outweighed the competing
    interests of the appellant's family life with her and  that  he  should
    not be allowed to remain in the UK for that reason alone.

10.  In relation to the appellant's  remaining  family  life,  the  Tribunal
    found that he was not living with his mother  prior  to  his  custodial
    sentence.  There appears to have been a disagreement between  them  but
    now they are reconciled.  However, the appellant is an adult.   He  was
    27 years of age and there was no evidence before the  Tribunal  of  any
    emotional or financial dependency upon his mother.  The  Tribunal  were
    satisfied that the evidence shows  that  the  appellant  has  a  normal
    relationship as an adult with his mother and whilst it may be hard upon
    her if the appellant has to go to Barbados,  they  did  not  find  that
    there  is  a  strong  family  life  claim  which  would  outweigh   the
    requirement for deportation as there was no  evidence  of  any  special
    kind of dependency.

11.  In relation to the appellant's half-sister it was claimed that  he  was
    a father figure and role model to her and that she would be  devastated
    if he had to  go  to  Barbados.   The  Tribunal  said  regrettably  the
    appellant took little heed of all this when he was  committing  a  very
    serious offence.  The OASys Report clearly shows that he did not  think
    about the consequences of his actions and the Tribunal were clearly  of
    the view that the appellant ignored the effect of  his  behaviour  upon
    others, including his younger half-sister.  The same could be  said  in
    relation to the appellant's relationship with his half-brother  because
    again, he did not consider the consequences of his  action  upon  other
    members of the family.  Whilst it is very regrettable that others  have
    had to suffer because of the appellant's actions, the Tribunal did  not
    consider that this was determinative of the appeal.  They were  clearly
    of the view that dealing in class  A  drugs  is  an  extremely  serious
    matter which ultimately brings a great deal of misery to  others.   The
    appellant  cannot  now  excuse  himself  by  saying  that  his   family
    considerations and his rehabilitation outweigh  factors  regarding  his
    offending behaviour.  In coming to this conclusion,  the  Tribunal  had
    also taken into account the Tribunal decision in which the  appellant's
    appeal against refusal of indefinite leave to  remain  was  allowed  in
    July 2005.  However this was some considerable time  ago  and  at  that
    time the appellant was 18 years old, living at home with his mother and
    had not committed any offences.  The facts before them at  the  hearing
    were quite different.

12.  The Tribunal considered the claim that the  appellant  has  nothing  to
    return to in  Barbados  and  that  he  has  not  been  there  for  some
    considerable time.  They found  that  even  if  the  appellant  has  no
    immediate family to return to, he is 27 years  of  age,  an  adult  and
    returning  to  an  island  where  English  is  the   spoken   language.
    Ethnically and culturally, the appellant has not shed himself of  these
    characteristics; indeed he would be unable to do so from the  point  of
    view of his ethnicity.  The Tribunal did not find  that  the  appellant
    would be a complete stranger in Barbados.  He might not have  any  work
    and he may well find it a struggle but these are not  reasons  why  the
    appellant should be entitled to succeed in  his  appeal.   Furthermore,
    the appellant has visited Barbados recently, in 2010 when he went there
    for a holiday.  There was no evidence that he would be in any  kind  of
    danger.  He claimed that his brother had been murdered but this is what
    he was told by others who were close to his brother.  The Tribunal were
    entirely satisfied that it would not  be  unreasonable  to  expect  the
    appellant to resume his life in Barbados.

13.  In conclusion and looking at all the facts of the  case,  the  Tribunal
    said that whilst they had some considerable sympathy for  the  feelings
    of the appellant's family and Miss Johnson's family, the  sad  fact  is
    that they could not simply overlook the  index  offence  and  what  the
    Sentencing Judge said.  A period of  six  years'  imprisonment  clearly
    reflected the seriousness of the matter and in conducting the balancing
    exercise, the Tribunal found that deportation is not outweighed by  the
    appellant's family life claim nor is it in respect of any private life.
     The appellant arrived in the UK  in  2000  and  he  was  sentenced  in
    October 2011.  He had thus  spent  seven  years  in  the  UK  prior  to
    imprisonment.  While they accepted that the appellant attended  Reading
    College to undertake a catering course, he did not complete the course.
     He worked at a local tie shop for a short period of time and after his
    brother's death in Barbados, he does not appear to have worked but  had
    signed on at the local job centre and began  to  get  into  debt.   Any
    private life established clearly cannot  comply  with  the  Immigration
    Rules  and  outside  the   Rules,   deportation   would   be   entirely
    proportionate for the prevention of crime, assuming there would  be  an
    interference with the appellant's limited private life.

14.  The Tribunal then had regard to the decision in MF Nigeria [2013]  EWCA
    Civ 1192 and concluded that insurmountable obstacles do  not  exist  in
    respect of family life continuing outside the UK.  It could not be said
    that literally  obstacles  exist  which  are  impossible  to  surmount.
    Having considered other case law the Tribunal found that  the  decision
    taken by the respondent was  entirely  proportionate,  looking  at  the
    whole of the evidence in the round.

15.  The Tribunal then went on to  say  that  Section  55  of  the  Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration Act  2009  was  raised  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant in respect of the respondent's duty regarding the welfare  of
    children.  Whilst they accepted that Deniesha Williams  was  under  the
    age of 18, she was not the appellant's child.  Their  relationship  was
    one  of  half-sister  and  half-brother  because  they  have  different
    fathers.  It was claimed in the  evidence  that  the  appellant  was  a
    father figure and role model  for  her  but  the  Tribunal  found  that
    praying in aid Section 55 is wholly misconceived and would indeed be  a
    distorted application of the act to do so by way of putting forward  an
    argument that the Secretary of State failed to consider the welfare  of
    Deniesha Williams because the appellant was looked up to by  her  as  a
    father figure.  In the view of the Tribunal there was no merit in  this
    argument.  The respondent was not under a duty to  consider  Deniesha's
    welfare in making the decision to deport the appellant  because  he  is
    not her father.  Even if she  regarded  him  as  a  father  figure,  he
    abdicated this role  by  his  behaviour  which  led  to  a  substantial
    custodial sentence.

16.  In granting the appellant permission  to  appeal,  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Carruthers said he suspected that there was little  substance  in
    at least some of the complaints made in the ten  pages  of  grounds  on
    which the appellant sought permission  to  appeal  -  particularly  the
    complaints in paragraphs 10 to 23.  Paragraphs 1 to 9  of  the  grounds
    complain (by reference to Section 55 of the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act 2009) that the Tribunal did not take a proper  approach
    to  the  situation  vis-�-vis  the  appellant's  half-sister,  Deniesha
    Williams.  Looking at paragraphs 33 and 34 of  the  determination,  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge's assessment was that those paragraphs of the
    grounds were at least arguable.  Given the nature  of  the  appellant's
    index offences, he suspected that factoring in the  best  interests  of
    Deniesha may make no difference to  the  outcome  of  this  appeal  (by
    analogy Zoumbas [2013] UKSC 0074, 27 November 2013).   But  because  he
    could not be sufficiently confident that the outcome would be the same,
    he decided to grant permission.

17.  In spite of the indication given in the grant  of  permission,  Counsel
    relied on all five grounds.  They are (1)  the  panel  took  the  wrong
    approach to Section 55 of the Borders,  Citizens  and  Immigration  Act
    2009 thereby failing to consider Deniesha's interests.  (2)  The  panel
    erred in law when they held that the appellant abdicated his role as  a
    father figure by his behaviour which led  to  a  substantial  custodial
    sentence.  (3)  The  panel  erred  when  they  applied  the   test   of
    insurmountable obstacles in respect of family life  continuing  outside
    the UK. (4) A challenge to the panel's finding that there was no family
    life between the appellant and his mother.  (5)  The  panel  failed  to
    consider relevant factors as a  result  of  misstating  material  facts
    and/or omitting material facts.

18.  I find no error of law in  the  Tribunal's  decision  for  the  reasons
    given below.

19.  I do not find that the Tribunal took the wrong approach to  Section  55
    of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 and thereby failed
    to consider Deniesha's best interests.   The  Tribunal  were  right  in
    saying that Deniesha is not the appellant's child.  Their  relationship
    is one of half-sister and  half-brother  because  they  have  different
    fathers.  I find that the evidence that Deniesha has a strong bond with
    the appellant, that she wears his clothes and would be devastated if he
    is deported, is not sufficient to elevate  their  relationship  into  a
    father  and  daughter  relationship.  I  agree  with  Mr.   Parkinson's
    submission that what is clear  is  that  as  time  went  on,  far  from
    becoming a more integrated member of the family,  the  appellant  moved
    away in 2009 because he wanted his independence.  He  rented  a  house.
    He saw the family often.  After the house was being sold he  moved  out
    and rented a room in  a  house  where  he  was  arrested  from  with  a
    significant amount of drugs.  The fact that the family  were  in  shock
    and knew nothing about this part of the appellant's life does  not  say
    much for the closeness of their relationship.  The  evidence  does  not
    suggest that the appellant assumed  parental  responsibility  for  her.
    His description of what he did for her was no more than the normal care
    and attention an older brother would give to his younger sister.

20.  I find that the panel did not err  in  law  when  they  held  that  the
    appellant abdicated his role as a father figure by his behaviour  which
    led to a substantial custodial sentence.  The finding was open  to  the
    Tribunal on the evidence.

21.  I find that  the  panel  did  not  err  in  their  application  of  the
    insurmountable obstacles test in  respect  of  family  life  continuing
    outside the UK.  The factors listed in paragraph 17 of the grounds  and
    identified again at paragraph 23 were all factors  which  the  Tribunal
    considered  throughout  the  determination.   At  paragraph   22   they
    considered that the appellant has not lived in the UK with valid  leave
    continuously for at  least  fifteen  years  immediately  preceding  the
    immigration decision.  They considered the strength of the  appellant's
    relationship with Miss Johnson at paragraph 22.  The panel's failure to
    consider the future intentions of the appellant and  Miss  Johnson  did
    not amount to a material error. In any  event  I  find  that  if  their
    future plan is to marry, the appellant's removal to Barbados should not
    prevent that from happening.  The fact that the  appellant  was  living
    with his mother  and  siblings  prior  to  being  sentenced,  does  not
    materially affect the Tribunal's decision as his return to  the  family
    home was as a result of a bail condition.  At paragraph 26 the Tribunal
    considered that the appellant had spent seven years in the UK prior  to
    his imprisonment.  The Tribunal accepted that he had  attended  Reading
    College to undertake a catering course but did not complete the course.
     They also considered that he had worked at a  local  tie  shop  for  a
    short period of time.  Consequently I find that  ground  5  is  without
    merit.

22.  Ground 4 states that it was submitted on behalf  of  the  appellant  at
    the hearing that although he was an adult he had family life  with  his
    mother and sister, which went beyond normal emotional ties, because  of
    the special emotional dependency the family have on each other  due  to
    the loss of Ron, the eldest son of the family who was killed at age  25
    in Barbados. It was argued that nowhere in the determination  is  there
    consideration of the family history.  There is consideration  of  Ron's
    death in paragraph 25  but  this  focuses  on  whether  Barbados  is  a
    dangerous on account of Ron having been killed there.   Whilst I accept
    that the death of Ron would  have  created  a  special  emotional  bond
    between members of the family, I find that  it  does  not  satisfy  the
    Kugathas test.  There was no evidence of dependency which  went  beyond
    the normal emotional ties.  The appellant was not financially dependent
    on his mother, nor was his mother dependent on him.  He was leading  an
    independent life away from his mother and the rest of the family.   The
    family history does not materially add to  the  findings  made  by  the
    Tribunal.   Their focus on  whether  Barbados  is  dangerous  does  not
    materially affect their decision.

23.  I accept Mr  Parkinson's  submission  that  there  is  nothing  in  the
    current jurisprudence, that is, SS Nigeria and MF Nigeria, to show that
    there are compelling circumstances in this  case  for  the  appellant's
    rights to trump the Secretary of State's decision.

24.  I find that the Tribunal's decision does not disclose an error of  law.
     The Tribunal's decision dismissing the appellant's appeal shall stand.
