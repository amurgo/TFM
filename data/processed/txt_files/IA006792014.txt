Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms S Jegarajah, Counsel instructed by Prime
                    Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Allan (12 November 2014) and Mr Norton (16
                    January 2015), Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals from the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissing his appeal against the decision by the respondent to  refuse
    him further leave to remain and to  make  directions  for  his  removal
    under Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality  Act  2006.
    The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and  I  do
    not consider that such a direction is warranted for  these  proceedings
    in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a national of Nigeria, whose date of birth is 30  June
    1974.  He first landed in the United Kingdom on 2  November  2002,  and
    claimed asylum  under  an  assumed  identity.   His  asylum  claim  was
    refused, and his appeal against the refusal of asylum was dismissed  in
    an Adjudicator's determination dated 18 July 2003.  On 2 April 2004 the
    appellant made an application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom
    as the unmarried partner of a British citizen.

 3. On 2 April 2008 the appellant  was  arrested  by  police  officers  and
    subsequently charged with four offences of  possessing  false  identity
    documents with intent.  On 18 June 2008,  after  pleading  guilty,  the
    appellant received a sixteen month prison sentence for these  offences,
    which was reduced to twelve months on appeal.

 4. On 12 November 2008 the appellant's appeal against the refusal of leave
    to remain as the unmarried partner of a person present and  settled  in
    the UK came before a panel chaired by  Judge  Chohan  at  Wolverhampton
    Magistrates' Court.

 5. In their subsequent determination, the panel saw no reason  to  disturb
    the earlier finding of the Tribunal that the appellant had made a false
    claim to originate from Sierra  Leone.   He  had  been  in  the  United
    Kingdom illegally for a period of six years.  In that time he had had a
    relationship with a woman with whom he had a son D born on 29  November
    2003.  The appellant had also had a  relationship  with  another  woman
    with whom he had a son J born on 2 January 2004.  His  current  partner
    was P, whom he had met some time in December 2006.   This  relationship
    was ongoing, and the couple had a daughter Y who had been  born  on  14
    December 2007.

 6. The evidence before the panel, which was  unchallenged,  was  that  the
    appellant's current partner and his ex-partners cooperated together  in
    order to facilitate contact between the three children.

 7. The panel said that if the appellant had no children in  this  country,
    and taking into account his adverse immigration  history  and  criminal
    record, they would have had no  hesitation  in  finding  the  appellant
    could be removed to Nigeria.  But he was part of a family unit, and the
    rights of his partner and three children could not be sidelined.   They
    had given due consideration to the cases of Beoku-Betts and  Chikwamba,
    and if the appellant was to be removed from the  United  Kingdom  there
    would be  an  interference  with  family  life  which  would  serve  no
    legitimate purpose and would be disproportionate. So they  allowed  his
    appeal on Article 8 grounds.

 8. The appellant was subsequently granted discretionary leave to remain in
    the  United  Kingdom  on  16  September  2011  on  the  basis  of   his
    relationship with P and four children whom he had fathered in  the  UK:
    D, J, Y and C.

 9. On 9 August 2013 the appellant applied to extend his leave to remain on
    the basis of his family  life.   His  application  was  refused  on  11
    December  2013.   The  Secretary  of  State  relied  on  the  following
    provisions  of  paragraph  322  as  justifying  the  refusal   of   his
    application for leave to remain:

         (5)  the undesirability  of  permitting  the  person  concerned  to
             remain in the United Kingdom  in  the  light  of  his  conduct
             (including convictions which  do  not  fall  within  paragraph
             322(1C),  character  or  associations  or  the  fact  that  he
             represents a threat to national security;

         (5A) It is undesirable to permit the person concerned to  enter  or
             remain in the United Kingdom  because,  in  the  view  of  the
             Secretary of State:

         (b)   They  are  a  persistent  offender  who  shows  a  particular
             disregard for the law.

    The nature of the appellant's criminal activities was such that he  was
    a persistent offender who showed a particular disregard  for  the  law.
    So he failed to "fulfil" sub-paragraphs (5) and (5A) of paragraph  322.
    On 2 February 2012 he was convicted of battery and  given  a  community
    order.  The Secretary of State was satisfied it would be undesirable to
    permit him to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  in  the  light  of  his
    character/convictions as he represented a threat to the public  and  it
    would not be desirable to grant him leave to remain.

10. The respondent also made a decision under the Parent route provided  in
    Appendix FM.  Reliance was placed on S-LTR.2.2.  The appellant had  not
    disclosed  several  criminal  convictions  when  his  application   was
    submitted on 9 August 2013.  These convictions were:

          1) possession of false/improperly obtained ID,  imprisonment  six
             months concurrent varied on appeal;

          2) driving a motor vehicle with excess alcohol  on  23  September
             2011, for which he was fined ï¿½100;

          3) battery on 23 September 2011 for which he received a community
             order;

          4) conviction on 18 January 2013 at  Isleworth  Crown  Court  for
             intimidating a witness  or  juror  with  intent  to  obstruct,
             pervert or interfere with justice, for  which  he  received  a
             term of imprisonment for ten months;

          5) destroying or damaging property on 24 December 2012.

11. It had been considered whether EX.1 applied to  his  application.   But
    whilst he had a genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship  with  a
    child,  his  application  fell  for  refusal  under   the   suitability
    requirements of the Immigration Rules as set out earlier.  As he failed
    to meet all the suitability requirements, he could not benefit from the
    criteria set out in EX.1.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

12. The appellant's appeal came before Judge Symes sitting at  Richmond  in
    the First-tier Tribunal  on  25  July  2014.   The  judge's  subsequent
    determination, which runs to 25 pages, was promulgated on  5  September
    2014.

13. At paragraph 5 of the determination, the judge set out the  appellant's
    convictions which were  listed  in  the  OP  Nexus  initial  assessment
    profile report for the appellant. At paragraph 6, the judge set  out  a
    longer list of alleged offences committed by the appellant  in  respect
    of which there had been no conviction.  The evidence relating to  these
    alleged offences was contained in two extensive lever arch files  which
    were placed before the judge, and their contents were  addressed  in  a
    witness statement from PC Iain Ross, which is introduced at paragraph 7
    of the determination.  The judge broke down the  evidence  provided  by
    the police as follows: "Evidence  provided  in  relation  to  impending
    prosecutions" addressed by  him  at  paragraphs  8  to  10;   "Evidence
    provided in relation to historic allegations for which there  had  been
    no  convictions"  addressed  by  him  at  paragraphs  11  to  31;  "Two
    additional arrests in 2014 - provided in a statement by PC  Iain  Ross"
    addressed by the judge at paragraphs 32  to  34;  and  "Police  reports
    provided in relation  to  the  offences  of  which  the  appellant  was
    convicted", addressed by the judge at paragraphs 35 to 39.

14. At paragraphs 40 and 41, the  judge  set  the  appellant's  grounds  of
    appeal.   His  extension  application  fell  to  be  considered   under
    transitional provisions for those granted DLR which was they  would  be
    granted an extension, provided their circumstances had not changed.  It
    was wrong to say he had not disclosed the offences in question.  He had
    not in fact been convicted of all  of  them,  and  he  had  provided  a
    printout of his criminal record with the application form.

15. At paragraphs 42 to 59, the judge set out the salient contents  of  the
    respective witness statements of the appellant and his ex-partner P.

16. At paragraphs 60 to 73, the judge set out the evidence which was  given
    orally at the hearing.  PC Hargreaves adopted her  statement  which  in
    turn adopted the witness statement of  PC  Ross.   Cross-examined,  she
    said that whilst the appellant had not been charged with  any  offence,
    his involvement in at least five sex offences made him a candidate  for
    the "high harm" operation against foreign national  offenders:  he  was
    thought to pose a risk of serious harm to the public.  The police  were
    satisfied, without further investigations, that his involvement in five
    offences of a similar nature made him a real risk to the public because
    of his arrest history and  the  volume  of  intelligence  against  him,
    evaluated on the balance of probabilities.

17. In the closing submissions on behalf of the respondent  (paragraph  72)
    it was submitted the evidence established a pattern  of  risk  creating
    behaviour,  involving  frequent  contact  with   the   police.    Nexus
    intelligence and arrest history were both admissible in this context as
    relevant  to  character  and  conduct.  Referring   to   the   previous
    determination,  the  appellant's  Article  8  rights  now  had  to   be
    considered in the light of the fact that he was not cohabiting with his
    partner and saw his children only  sporadically,  paying  limited  cash
    towards their upkeep; his lack of gainful employment but that no  child
    could be treated as truly dependent on him.

18. For the appellant  it  was  submitted  that  there  was  no  convincing
    evidence supplied of a pattern of behaviour risking harm to the  public
    on the balance of probabilities. The witnesses had not said  that  they
    were threatened to withdraw their accusations. Mostly  the  appellant's
    claimed offending arose from social outings that involved  alcohol  and
    then sex, followed by spurious allegations.  It was not  credible  that
    genuine victims would not pursue their cases had they truly been raped.
     There were British citizen children in this case and  he  was  a  role
    model to children. Surely no mother would leave a child with  a  person
    thought to be a criminal, as P had done?  The maintenance of ï¿½80 weekly
    was a significant payment and his children's mothers did  not  complain
    about the adequacy of financial provision.  There had  been  no  family
    proceedings  against  him  resisting  contact  and  he  enjoyed  agreed
    arrangements with three women to assist in caring for  their  children.
    His most recent partner had had another child with him after  the  last
    Tribunal proceedings, and years later she was  still  willing  to  come
    with him to court.  He had learned his lesson and did not represent any
    danger to the community.

19. The judge's findings were set out paragraph 74  onwards.   He  observed
    that in Farquharson (Removal - proof of conduct) [2013] UKUT 146  (IAC)
    the Upper  Tribunal  found  that  the  principles  established  in  Bah
    (Liability to deportation) [2012] UKUT 196 (IAC) should apply to  cases
    where the Secretary of  State  alleged  that  the  person's  character,
    conduct and associations demand their  deportation.   Those  principles
    are set out at 46 to 47 and  63  to  65  of  Bah,  and  held  that  the
    Secretary of State was permitted  to  rely  upon  allegations  criminal
    conduct should not result in criminal proceedings even if  it  involved
    the  omission  of  hearsay  evidence  and  evidence  from  un-named  or
    undisclosed sources or anonymous sources.  Any specific acts  that  had
    already occurred in the past had to be proven by the Secretary of State
    to the civil standard of balance of probabilities bearing in  mind  the
    seriousness of the allegations in question.  The weight to be  attached
    to  the  respondent's  materials  would  depend  on  its  nature,   the
    circumstances  in  which  it  was  collected  or  recorded,   and   the
    susceptibility of the informant or original informant to error, and the
    extent to which  the  appellant  was  able  to  comment  or  rebut  it.
    Furthermore, unsourced assertions do not suffice and evidence would  be
    considered more cogent where  supported  by  other  relevant  documents
    (Farquharson at 89 to 91).  The assessment of future risk based on past
    conduct must be assessed by the standard  of  a  reasonable  degree  of
    likelihood.

20. The judge held at paragraph 76 that  in  principle  the  same  approach
    should be taken to a case where those considerations were said to count
    against the grant of further leave to remain, which turned  on  similar
    questions of public interest.

21. At paragraph 77, the judge found that the appellant's  convictions  did
    not merit the refusal  of  his  application  for  leave  to  remain  on
    discretionary grounds.  At paragraph 78, the  judge  did  not  consider
    that there was anything in the impending prosecutions that merited  the
    refusal of his application on discretionary grounds.  At paragraph  79,
    the judge held that that of significantly more substance was the police
    intelligence in relation to allegations of sexual  offending.   It  was
    necessary for him to make findings of fact in relation to these, and he
    said he would do so  applying  the  principles  identified  above.   In
    reviewing the evidence put together by the police in paragraphs  80  to
    82, the judge reached the following conclusion at paragraph 83:

         I find that these are matters which raise real concerns as  to  the
         appellant's  character,  conduct  and  association.   There  is   a
         worrying trend in these incidents in which the appellant is accused
         of sexual aggression, subsequent to which several  of  the  victims
         withdrew their complaints; I  also  note  that  other  complainants
         (male victims of physical violence) in February and July 2005  also
         withdrew their allegations against him.  It is surprising  that  so
         many people, apparently unconnected to one another, had  chosen  to
         withdraw  allegations  for  reasons  that  the   police   recorders
         essentially unexplained.

22. The judge continued in paragraph 84:

         There are detailed investigation  reports  as  have  been  set  out
         above.  Whilst  these  accusations  had  not  been  proven  to  the
         criminal standard, it seems to me the volume of  behaviour  arising
         from broadly similar  situations,  in  which  women  in  vulnerable
         situations were threatened and  assaulted,  is  a  matter  that  is
         established on the balance of probabilities.  There  are  not  only
         accusations of sexual misbehaviour but  also  of  intimidation  and
         blackmail, in relation to which he was arrested in  2014;  his  own
         prepared statement referenced as the second of the  allegations  in
         2014 above (CRSIS 0506157/14) recorded that he owed drug  money  to
         particular individuals, indicates that he has been reckless in  the
         company he keeps and he has bought and used drugs...The  case  that
         he has put in rebuttal, of being over  a  significant  period,  for
         example, devoted family man who only once left the family  home  on
         an isolated evening is quite inconsistent with his  behaviour  that
         night by which, within hours, he was  receiving  oral  sex  from  a
         person he had only just met in a public bar.

23. The judge also found at paragraph 85 that the appellant had  failed  to
    disclose all his convictions in his application.

24. At paragraph 87, the judge said that left the question of  whether  his
    expulsion was contrary to his private and family life and that  of  the
    children.  While he accepted he had an ongoing  relationship  with  the
    various children whereby he saw them occasionally,  the  fact  remained
    there  had  been  a  significant  change  of  circumstances  since  his
    relationship with P broke down.  He found her evidence to  be  credible
    as to his ongoing role in the life of their  children.   This  was  not
    disputed by the respondent.  But there was very limited  material  from
    which he could draw any  conclusions  as  to  whether  the  immigration
    decision was inconsistent with the need to ensure  that  their  welfare
    was  preserved  and  safeguarded  under  Section  55  of  the  Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.  Whilst the immigration  decision
    represented an interference with his and the children's family life, it
    was not of the most serious kind.

25. At paragraph 88, the judge held as follows:

         Given my findings as to  the  appellant's  character,  conduct  and
         associations, it seems to me that his removal  is  necessary  in  a
         democratic society.  He represents a threat to the public  interest
         given the real risk that  he  would  continue  to  be  involved  in
         conduct involving sexual misbehaviour that would  lead  to  further
         allegations against him, whether or not they proceeded to  criminal
         trial.  I consider that this outweighs the family life that he  has
         established here and renders his removal proportionate.

The Application for Permission to Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

26. Ms Jegarajah,  who  did  not  appear  below,  settled  the  appellant's
    application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  In  ground
    1, she said the point of law raised in this case was one of fundamental
    importance.  The question was whether it was lawful for the police, who
    were not a formal party to the proceedings, to be permitted to  produce
    unlimited allegations relating to a  series  of  alleged  offences  for
    which there had been no conviction.

27. She proceeded to answer this question in the  negative.   It  was  both
    unlawful and unconstitutional.  It would mean that any foreign national
    who had been included under Operation Nexus and  whom  the  police  had
    sought to target (in the absence of convictions of sufficient  severity
    to lead to deportation) could nonetheless rely on  police  intelligence
    of insufficient weight to attract a conviction, applying  the  criminal
    standard.  Effectively foreign nationals are facing  a  criminal  trial
    using anecdotal evidence substantiated by the  police,  not  a  neutral
    party, in order to accelerate removal.   Essentially  they  were  being
    convicted by another means.  The cases  of  Bah  and  Farquharson  were
    distinguishable because:

      1) those cases did not concern large scale police/UKBA operations such
         as Operation Nexus and SWAYLE;

      2) such operations involved a systematic  policy  by  the  police  and
         immigration services to submit any  and  every  report  of  varying
         evidential quality  with  a  view  to  influencing  an  immigration
         appeal;

      3) the relevance test was redundant in immigration appeals because the
         prejudicial material had already been had already been submitted;

      4) the Tribunal ought to have excluded  all  materials  that  did  not
         emanate from a reliable, in other words independent, source;

      5) it could not be right or fair for Operation Nexus officers  to  use
         the Tribunal to effect a removal by avoiding  the  criminal  courts
         and the criminal standard of  proof  that  served  to  protect  all
         defendants, whether British or foreign nationals.

28. Ground 2 was  that  the  judge  had  erred  in  failing  to  treat  the
    determination of Judge Chohan as a starting point.  There had  been  no
    engagement with  the  previous  judicial  findings  at  all,  and  this
    omission gave rise to a fundamental error in  respect  of  the  judge's
    Article 8 assessment.



The Grant of Permission to Appeal

29. On 13 October 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge Shimmin granted permission
    to appeal, holding that  both  grounds  of  appeal  disclosed  arguable
    errors of law.



The Error of Law Hearing on 12 November 2014

30. At the hearing before me, Ms Jegarajah developed the  arguments  raised
    in her grounds of appeal.  She also applied for permission to  raise  a
    third ground of appeal, which was that the judge had erred  in  law  in
    not considering Section 117B(6) in his proportionality assessment.

31. Mr Allan did not object to this third ground of appeal being raised  at
    a  late  stage,  and  accepted  that  it  had  merit.   Whilst  it  was
    understandable that the judge had not considered Section  117B  of  the
    2002 Act which did not come into  force  until  three  days  after  the
    hearing (28 July 2014), in his view, following YM (Uganda),  the  judge
    should have considered the impact of Section 117B(6).  But there was no
    merit, he submitted, in the first two grounds of appeal, and he  relied
    on the extensive bundle of  authorities  by  way  of  rebuttal  to  the
    central charge made by  Ms  Jegarajah,  which  was  that  it  had  been
    unlawful and unfair for the First-tier Tribunal to  take  into  account
    evidence of a series of alleged offences by the appellant which had not
    been proved to the criminal standard.

Reasons for Rejecting Grounds 1 and 2

32. Judge Symes correctly  summarised  the  law  as  stated  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Farquharson and Bah.

33. In Farquharson, a presidential panel held inter  alia  as  follows  (as
    stated in the head note):

         (1)  Where the respondent relies  on  allegations  of  conduct  and
             proceedings for removal, the same principles apply as to proof
             of conduct and the assessment of risk to  the  public,  as  in
             deportation cases: Bah [2012] UKUT 196 (IAC) etc.  applicable.



         (2)  A criminal charge that has not resulted in a conviction is not
             a criminal record; the acts that led  to  the  charge  may  be
             established as conduct.

         (3)  If the respondent seeks to establish the conduct by  reference
             to the contents of police CRIS Reports, the relevant documents
             should be produced,  rather  than  a  bare  witness  statement
             referring to them.

         (4)  The material relied on must be supplied to  the  appellant  in
             good time to prepare for the appeal.

         (5)  The judge has a duty to ensure a fair hearing is  obtained  by
             affording the appellant sufficient time to study the documents
             and respond.

34. Ms Jegarajah did not identify any decision by the Court of Appeal which
    undermines Farquharson. The high water mark of her case is that  in  AG
    (Ivory Coast) C5/2012/1442, permission to appeal  was  granted  by  Sir
    Stephen Sedley in an order  dated  5  December  2012.   Apparently  his
    reasons for granting permission to appeal were as follows:

         It is cogently arguable  the  introduction  of  highly  prejudicial
         police intelligence  reports  was  procedurally  and  substantively
         impermissible.  The issue is arguably nothing to  do  with  weight.
         What Hickinbottom J said in this regard in V, paras 46 ff, may well
         call for re-examination.  In the present  case,  where  the  Maslov
         question was critical, the reports are capable of having tipped the
         balance.

35. However, the Court of Appeal  did  not  go  on  to  decide  the  point.
    Moreover, when granting permission to appeal, Sir  Stephen  Sedley  did
    not  have  the  benefit  of  the  presidential  panel's  reasoning   in
    Farquharson, which had not yet been decided.  As a consequence  of  the
    consent order made in AG on 28 February 2013 by the  Court  of  Appeal,
    AG's appeal came back before the Upper Tribunal on 19  July  2013.   At
    paragraph 54 of the subsequent  decision  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Kekic
    said:

         It is alleged that the respondent introduced  'materials  that  are
         now  accepted  were  included  unlawfully'.   It  is  recorded   in
         paragraph 14 of the statement of reasons annexed to  the  order  of
         the Court of Appeal the respondent no longer relied on  the  police
         intelligence reports.  The Court of Appeal declined  to  adjudicate
         on the point.  We had not been  shown  any  evidence  which  either
         states or implied that the respondent accepted that  this  material
         was included unlawfully.  No such inference can be drawn  from  the
         fact that it was no longer relied on by the  respondent.   We  find
         there has been no acceptance or finding  that  the  materials  were
         included unlawfully.  The evidence before  us  does  not  establish
         that it was included unlawfully.

36. As well as seeking to argue that the reception of  police  intelligence
    material is unlawful in principle, it is also possible to discern three
    subsidiary arguments advanced by Ms Jegarajah.

37. The first is  that  such  evidence  does  not  meet  the  criterion  of
    reliability, which is specified in the applicable guidance  as  to  the
    evidence required to support a decision that a person's behaviour calls
    into question their character and/or conduct and/or associations to the
    extent that it is undesirable to allow them to enter or remain  in  the
    UK.  I consider the judge has given adequate reasons  for  finding  the
    evidence to be reliable.

38. Secondly, it is argued that the respondent is  in  effect  abusing  the
    green light that it was given in  Farquharson  to  pursue  large  scale
    combined police and UKBA operations such as Operation Nexus and SWAYLE.
     This submission does not stand up to scrutiny.  If a course of conduct
    is pronounced by a court to be lawful, it cannot become an abuse simply
    because it is pursued on a large scale.

39. Thirdly, Ms Jegarajah submits that it was unfair for the respondent  to
    change her case from that  put  forward  in  the  Reasons  for  Refusal
    Letter.  As Ms Jegarajah rightly points out, the refusal letter  mainly
    relied on the proposition that the appellant was a persistent offender,
    as shown by his convictions.  According Ms Jegarajah, only two  of  the
    five convictions listed (as being ones that  the  appellant  failed  to
    disclose) were correctly attributed to the appellant as convictions.

40. I do not find it necessary to crosscheck the list of convictions  given
    by the judge with the list of allegedly undisclosed  convictions  given
    in the refusal letter.  The key consideration is that for the  purposes
    of the appeal hearing the appellant knew the case that he had to  meet,
    and he had been given sufficient time to study the two lever arch files
    of police intelligence  material  relied  on  by  the  respondent,  and
    sufficient time to respond to such material.  It is not suggested  that
    the requirements referred to in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of  the  headnote
    in Farquharson were not observed in this appeal.

41. Accordingly, I find that ground 1 of the appeal is  not  made  out.   I
    also find no merit in ground 2.  It is apparent from paragraphs 72  and
    87 that the judge  took  the  determination  of  Judge  Chohan  as  his
    starting point on the question whether the  appellant's  expulsion  was
    contrary to his private and family life and that of his children.   The
    judge gave adequate reasons for explaining why the  decision  of  Judge
    Chohan was not his end point. There had been a  significant  change  of
    circumstances,  which  included   the   fact   that   the   appellant's
    relationship with P had broken down and the fact that the appellant had
    become a threat to the public.

42. Mr Allan's concession in respect to ground  3  to  the  appeal  is  not
    determinative of the question of whether the judge did in fact  err  in
    law in not applying a statutory provision which was not in force at the
    date of the hearing.  But having exercised my own independent  judgment
    on the matter, I find the concession was rightly  given.   As  judicial
    consideration of Section 117B(6)  might  have  had  a  bearing  on  the
    outcome of the proportionality assessment under Article 8, I set  aside
    the judge's decision on the Article 8 claim.  But there was no error of
    law in the finding that the appellant should be refused  further  leave
    to remain because paragraph 322(5) applied.

Directions for a resumed hearing pursuant to Ground 3

43. I directed that there would be a further hearing before  me  to  remake
    the decision under Article 8 ECHR.  I directed that  all  the  findings
    made by the First-tier  Tribunal  would  be  preserved,  save  for  the
    finding on proportionality.

44. I gave the appellant permission to produce further evidence relating to
    his family life since  the  date  of  the  hearing  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Hearing on 16 January 2015 to remake decision on Article 8 ECHR

45. The appellant was called as a witness, and he adopted as his  evidence-
    in-chief a supplementary witness statement dated 13 January 2015.   His
    devotion to his children and family had not changed, but there had been
    significant change with regard to his  relationship  with  his  current
    partner.  At paragraph 3 of his previous statement dated 22  July  2014
    he had mentioned the fact there were ongoing attempts at reconciliation
    and that there had been a lot of progress.  His current partner  P  had
    given evidence about their relationship at the hearing before the First-
    tier Tribunal.  She was very frank and honest about the  state  of  the
    relationship, and she had not ruled out them coming together again.

46. He could now state categorically that the relationship was back on, and
    they had decided to put the past behind them.  He  spent  most  of  his
    time in her house with the children, and they were very happy  together
    as a family.  They spent Christmas together as a family unit and he was
    grateful that they had been able to resolve their differences.

47. His partner P was a German national who was  exercising  treaty  rights
    here.  She could not relocate with him to Nigeria or  to  Sierra  Leone
    where his mother came from.  If he was deported it would be a  clog  in
    the wheel of his partner exercising her treaty rights in  the  UK.   It
    was imperative that she  should  be  able  to  exercise  free  movement
    rights; and if  he  was  deported,  this  might  prove  difficult.   He
    remained in contact with all his children, and  he  played  a  fatherly
    role as best as he could in the prevailing circumstances.

48. The appellant was asked supplementary questions  by  Counsel,  and  was
    cross-examined by Mr Norton.  He confirmed that P had  given  birth  to
    his child Y on 14 December 2007, and to his child C on 6 February 2011.
     Y and C lived at his girlfriend's house.  He had been  sleeping  there
    since December 2014 unofficially.  He had a key to the property.   They
    had had an argument in January or February 2013, and so he  decided  to
    move out.  But between January and  December  2013  he  still  did  the
    school run.  He had four children in all by three different women,  and
    they all knew each other.  He organised it so that they  could  all  be
    together from time to time.  His son D had moved with  his  mother  and
    stepfather to Birmingham last year, so he did not see D very often.  It
    worked out at about once a month.  His son J lived with his  mother  in
    Charing Cross.  He saw J twice a month, and it was on  these  occasions
    that J also saw Y and C.  They got on very well with each other.  I was
    shown photographs of the appellant with his four children.

49. In cross-examination, it was pointed out that in his witness  statement
    the appellant had not said that he was actually living with P  and  the
    children.  He answered he still had his room at the Beach Road address.
     The council had not yet approved him as a tenant of the property which
    P rented from the council.  An application was pending.

50. It was put to the appellant that in P's witness statement dated January
    2015 P stated at paragraph 5 that they were not  living  together.   He
    answered that she was going to the council.  He did  not  know  whether
    she made the application or not.  But he had given her a  copy  of  his
    tenancy agreement for the  Beach  Road  address.   This  was  privately
    rented accommodation  in  Hounslow  ten  minutes  walk  away  from  P's
    property.

51. P was called as a witness and  adopted  as  her  evidence-in-chief  her
    witness statement dated January 2015 in the  appellant's  bundle.   She
    was a German national, who had arrived in the UK in  April  2003.   She
    and the appellant  were  (past  tense)  in  a  loving  relationship  as
    partners.  They had had two children together,  namely  Y  and  C.   In
    paragraph 3 she said:

         As with every  relationship  with  different  racial  and  cultural
         backgrounds  our  relationship  was   difficult.    We   have   had
         disagreements since the end of  2012  and  then  he  moved  out  in
         January 2013, and after a while we resumed contact.  He comes  over
         to the house to see the kids and pick them up  to  school  and  for
         weekends.

52. They had been having reconciliatory meetings with a view  to  exploring
    the possibility of reconciliation and to be together as a  family  unit
    again for the simple reason that  she  had  seen  improvements  in  his
    character and his disposition  towards  her  and  the  children.   They
    believed that for the sake of the children  they  should  settle  their
    differences.  The attempt to reconcile was a  genuine  attempt  by  the
    appellant to have a settled family like they used to have previously.

53. She could now confirm that they had had a successful reconciliation and
    very fruitful discussions, and she could categorically state that  they
    were back together as a family.  They were not living together  at  the
    moment because she needed to inform the council so that the appropriate
    amendment on rent and council tax could be made.  He was in  the  house
    almost all the time and he spent weekends at the house.  They had spent
    Christmas together as a family unit, and he had bought  gifts  for  the
    children.

54. The appellant loved his children and they also loved him.  He played  a
    very active role in their upbringing, even though  they  did  not  live
    together as a unit.  They had  been  living  together  for  about  five
    years.  They hoped to resume cohabitation very soon when  the  benefits
    issue was sorted out.  The children went to him for  weekends,  and  he
    also visited them.  He contributed financially between ï¿½80 and  ï¿½120  a
    month.  He took the children to school and picked them up from school.

55. P was asked supplementary questions by Counsel, and was  cross-examined
    by Mr Norton.   She had had  an  up  and  down  relationship  with  the
    appellant.  Their relationship was now better.  They  were  working  on
    their relationship.  She had not  yet  applied  to  the  council.   The
    appellant had his own address.  He was not with them.  He did not  live
    with them, but it was her intention that they should live together.

56. The appellant had started staying overnight from December.  On the days
    when she went to work (which was three to four times a  week,   whereas
    the appellant had said that it was five times a  week)  he  would  come
    round before she left the house at 3.30am and spend  the  rest  of  the
    night at the house.  Even after he had moved out in  January  2013,  he
    had done that.  My attention was drawn to paragraph 3  of  her  witness
    statement before the First-tier Tribunal in which she implied that they
    had ceased contact after he had moved out in January  2013.   She  said
    they had never lost contact, so that he could maintain contact with the
    kids.  The difference between the state of affairs at the time  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal hearing and now was that he was spending more  time
    with her.  They were always in contact after he moved out, just not  as
    a couple.  The most important thing for her was the  help  he  gave  in
    taking the children to school.  He stayed a few nights every week.

57. Ms Jegarajah submitted that the decision appealed against  was  not  in
    accordance with the law as the Secretary of State failed to  take  into
    account that the appellant was in a durable relationship  with  an  EEA
    national exercising treaty rights here.  At the time of the hearing  in
    the First-tier Tribunal there had been a breakdown in the relationship,
    but that was a temporary blip.  The couple  were  now  reconciled,  and
    having regard to the long-term history  of  the  relationship  and  the
    children born out of it, the relationship should be characterised as  a
    durable one.  It followed that the  respondent  would  need  to  invoke
    Regulation 21 of the Regulations 2006 in order to justify  the  refusal
    of the application, following YB [2008] UKAIT 0062.   Durable  was  not
    the same as romantic.  The relationship between the appellant and P had
    endured over the years, and it was intact.

58. Alternatively, it was not proportionate to remove the appellant  having
    regard to Section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act as amended by the Immigration
    Act 2014.  It was not reasonable for any of the appellant's children to
    follow him abroad.

59. On behalf of the Secretary of  State,  Mr  Norton  submitted  that  the
    appellant had not discharged the burden of proving that  he  was  in  a
    durable relationship with an EEA  national.   There  was  an  expressed
    intention to reform the family unit which had broken up, but  intention
    was not enough.  There was no physical evidence  of  cohabitation,  and
    there was conflicting evidence about the current  living  arrangements.
    The appellant and P were still working things out.

Discussion and Findings

60. It is necessary  to  distinguish  between  a  durable  relationship  as
    parents and a durable relationship as partners.  In order to qualify as
    an extended family member of P, the appellant has to show that he is in
    a durable relationship with P as her partner.  It is not enough for him
    to show that, despite the difficulties in their relationship,  both  of
    them have maintained contact with  each  other  for  the  sake  of  the
    children, and to enable the appellant to assist P in the children's day-
    to-day care.

61. In the light of the undisputed facts, I  find  the  appellant  has  not
    discharged the burden of proving that he is in a  durable  relationship
    with  an  EEA  national.   There  are  historic  difficulties  in   the
    relationship, which are alluded to by P in  paragraph  3  of  her  most
    recent witness statement.  Relations  between  her  and  the  appellant
    deteriorated to the point where P moved  out  of  the  family  home  in
    January 2013. .  It is also necessary to bear in mind that there is  an
    undisturbed finding of fact by Judge Symes that the  appellant  is  not
    the devoted family man that he claims  to  be.   The  judge  made  this
    finding in paragraph 84  of  his  determination,  having  accepted  the
    evidence tendered by the police that  the  appellant  was  a  dangerous
    sexual predator  who  threatened  and  assaulted  women  in  vulnerable
    situations.  Since it is the appellant's evidence that  he  was  in  an
    ongoing relationship with P prior to January 2013, it may have  been  P
    who complained to the police of common assault in  November  2012,  and
    sought a non-molestation order against him: see paragraph 82  of  Judge
    Symes' determination.

62.  I  am  not  satisfied  that  there  has  been  a  material  change  of
    circumstances since the  hearing  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  having
    regard  to  the  preserved  findings  of   the   First-tier   Tribunal.
    Furthermore,   despite   the   alleged   reconciliation,   the   living
    arrangements remain largely unchanged from what they were at  the  time
    of the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal.   The  appellant  still
    lives at a separate address, and he continues  to  come  round  in  the
    early hours of the morning to take over the care of the children before
    P leaves for work at 3.30am.  There was conflicting evidence  from  the
    appellant and P as to how many nights each week  the  appellant  stayed
    overnight, rather than coming round just before 3.30am.   But  even  if
    the level of contact has increased, it is clear from P's oral  evidence
    that the couple are still working things  out  and  they  are  not  yet
    reconciled.  Not only are they not living together from the perspective
    of the Council, but I am  also  not  persuaded  that  they  are  living
    together unofficially in a relationship akin to marriage. So  they  are
    not to be treated as being in a durable relationship.

63. Turning to the appellant's Article 8 claim, he cannot avail himself  of
    the parent route under Appendix FM as he does not meet the  suitability
    requirements.  He has a potentially stronger claim outside  the  Rules,
    as the  best  interests  of  minor  affected  children  are  a  primary
    consideration  in  the  proportionality  assessment.   So  far  as  the
    appellant's two sons are concerned, the finding of  Judge  Symes  holds
    good.  He found that the appellant had an ongoing relationship with his
    various  children  whereby  he  saw  them  occasionally.    Given   the
    appellant's limited role  in  his  sons'  upbringing,  his  prospective
    removal will not impact significantly on them.  If and insofar  as  his
    removal can be said to be contrary to their  best  interests,  it  will
    only be so to a moderate degree, and it does not take very much on  the
    public  interest  side  of  the  equation  to   make   the   threatened
    interference a proportionate one.

64. Judge Symes accepted the appellant's evidence as to his ongoing role in
    the life of his daughters Y and C.   Nonetheless,  he  found  that  the
    threatened interference  with  the  family  life  which  the  appellant
    enjoyed with all his children, including Y and C, was not of  the  most
    serious kind.  I consider that this  finding  still  holds  good.   The
    appellant is not living under the same roof as Y and C, and he  is  not
    their primary carer.   I  accept  that  it  is  contrary  to  the  best
    interests of Y and C to be deprived of regular and direct contact  with
    their father, but it is not shown  that  his  removal  will  compromise
    their welfare, having regard to the preserved findings of fact  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal referred to earlier when discussing the question of
    durable relationship.

65.  Part  5A  entitled  "Article  8   of   the   ECHR:   public   interest
    considerations" came into  force  from  28  July  2014.   Section  117A
    provides:

         (1)  This Part applies where a court or  tribunal  is  required  to
             determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-

             (a)  breaches a person's right  to  respect  for  private  and
                  family life under Article 8, and

             (b)  as a result would be unlawful  under  section  6  of  the
                  Human Rights Act 1998.

         (2)  In considering the public  interest  question,  the  court  or
             tribunal must (in particular) have regard-

             (a)  in all cases, to the  considerations  listed  in  section
                  117B, and

             (b)  in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals,
                  to the considerations listed in section 117C.

         (3)  In subsection (2), 'the public interest  question'  means  the
             question of whether an interference with a person's  right  to
             respect for private and family life is justified under Article
             8(2).

66.  Section  117B  lists  the  following  "Article  8:   public   interest
    considerations applicable in all cases (my emphasis)":

         (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in  the
             public interest.

         (2)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are able to speak  English,  because  persons  who  can  speak
             English-

             (a)  are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

         (3)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are financially independent, because such persons-

             (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

         (4)  Little weight should be given to-

             (a)  a private life, or

             (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

             that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is
             in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5)  Little weight should be given to a private life established by
             a person at a time when the  person's  immigration  status  is
             precarious.

         (6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
             public interest does not require the person's removal where-

             (a)   the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
                  relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
                  the United Kingdom.

67. Sub-sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-paragraph  (6)  of  Section  117B
    mirror EX.1(a) of Appendix FM.  Under the structure of Appendix FM,  if
    an applicant satisfies the requirements of EX.1(a) it is not  necessary
    to go on to consider the public interest question. For in  Appendix  FM
    the Secretary of State has set  out  in  considerable  detail  how  she
    believes the balance between Article 8(1) and Article  8(2)  should  be
    struck in family life cases; and if a person can bring  himself  within
    the relevant qualifying criteria, then ipso facto  it  is  not  in  the
    public interest from the SSHD's perspective for them to be removed.

68. I accept that  the  appellant  is  not  being  deported  as  a  foreign
    convicted criminal. I also accept that  all  four  of  the  appellant's
    children are qualifying children with whom the appellant has a  genuine
    and subsisting parental relationship, and that it is not reasonable  to
    expect any of the children to follow their father  to  his  country  of
    return. But I do not accept that sub-Section 6 is thereby a trump  card
    for the appellant  in  the  overall  proportionality  assessment.   The
    public  interest  considerations  listed  in  Section  117B   are   not
    exhaustive or exclusionary.  All the considerations set out in  Section
    117B have to be taken into account when assessing proportionality,  but
    it does not mean that other relevant considerations referred to in  the
    Rules or recognised in the relevant jurisprudence must be ignored.  The
    public interest in the appellant's removal is primarily driven  by  the
    public interest in the prevention of crime, rather than by  the  public
    interest in immigration control.

69. Having regard to the undisturbed findings of the First-tier Tribunal as
    to the danger which the appellant poses to the public, I find that  the
    threatened interference is proportionate.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal
under the Rules did not  contain  an  error  of  law,  and  accordingly  the
decision stands.  The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  the
appellant's Article 8 claim outside the Rules contained  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision is set aside  and  the  following  decision  is
substituted: the appellant's appeal on Article 8 grounds outside  the  Rules
is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
