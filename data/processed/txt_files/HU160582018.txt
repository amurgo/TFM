Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr A Burnett, Counsel, instructed by Arlington Crown
                    Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr Walker, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS
Introduction

   1. The appellant is a national of Uganda, born on 29 August 1982. She
      came to the United Kingdom on 8 September 2008 with leave as a
      student. She obtained two further periods of further leave on this
      basis until 30 January 2013. She was then granted leave as the spouse
      of Mr Steven Lukwago, a British citizen until 8th February 2015.
      Further leave on this basis was again granted until 7 May 2017.

   2. On 4 April 2017 she applied for indefinite leave to remain on the
      basis of her marriage. This was considered under paragraph 287(a) of
      Part 8 of the immigration rules. Paragraph 287 (a)(ii) requires an
      applicant to demonstrate they are still married to their spouse and
      that the relationship is subsisting. As part of her application she
      was asked to provide documents spread out over two years to
      demonstrate this. She submitted some documentation but the respondent
      referred to gaps in the evidence between May 2015 and July 2016 and
      September 2016 to December 2016. Furthermore, checks suggested that
      the parties had not been living together since 2014. Consequently her
      application was refused on 10 July 2016.

   3. A further ground for refusal was based upon a failure to demonstrate
      adequate maintenance (para 287(a)(v)). Regard was had to the
      appellant's private life and paragraph 276 ADE(i) but the appellant
      had not spent the necessary time here and no issues in relation to
      reintegration were identified. No other basis for the grant of leave
      was seen.

   4. The grounds of appeal contend that the marriage was subsisting albeit
      there had been a difficult period in the marriage. The appellant
      stated she had been earning ï¿½20,000 per year and so maintenance was
      not an issue.

The First tier Tribunal

   5. The appellant's appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Buckwell
      at Hatton Cross on 5 March 2019. The decision had originally been
      certified and this was subsequently removed. The appellant was
      represented by Mr A Burnett, Counsel, as he does now. In a decision
      promulgated on 27 March 2019 her appeal was dismissed.

   6. The appellant's husband did not attend the appeal hearing. The
      appellant stated that she cohabited with her future husband in
      November 2011 and that they married were married on 30 December 2011.
      She described the relationship as being on and off and said that her
      husband was involved with drugs and alcohol and had consequent
      criminal convictions. In cross-examination she accepted that she and
      her husband had not lived together all the time and there was domestic
      abuse. She also had been unable to produce relevant P60's for 2016/17
      and 2017/18. She had no documentation about her husband's income.

   7. In submissions the presenting officer continued to rely upon the
      refusal decision. In response, the appellant's representative referred
      to an earlier application for indefinite leave to remain in which he
      said the requirements were met but for the absence of a Life in the UK
      test.

   8. Paragraph 88 of the decision records the appellant's representative in
      submissions making the point that the appellant has always had leave
      to remain and there had been a 10 year period of lawful residence.
      Reference was made to the decision of OA and Others (human rights; new
      matter; s.120) Nigeria [2019] UK UT 00065.

   9. First-tier Tribunal Judge Buckwell rejected the argument that part
      performance of the immigration rules in an earlier application could
      be carried forward to the present. The judge also found at the
      evidence established the appellant and her husband had not been living
      together for a significant period and found that the marriage had not
      been subsisting for a number of years. Consequently, the judge found
      that the immigration rules were not met and she was not entitled to
      indefinite leave to remain as such.

  10. At paragraph 100 the judge went on to consider the alternative
      argument that the appellant should be entitled to indefinite leave to
      remain on the basis of her lawful presence for 10 years. The judge
      made the point that her student leave commenced on 27 August 2008 and
      the last period of leave granted to her expired on 7 May 2017. The
      judge found that she did not have leave for at least 10 years. No
      other basis was seen for allowing the appeal.

The Upper Tribunal

  11. Permission to appeal was sought on the basis, inter alia, the judge
      materially erred in refusing the grant of leave on the basis of 10
      years lawful residence. This was on the basis that the judge took the
      expiry of her last grant of leave on 7 May 2017 as the end date.
      However, it was argued the judge failed to take into account the fact
      that her leave continued by virtue of section 3C of the 1971
      Immigration Act. Reference was made to OA and Others (human rights;
      new matter; s.120) Nigeria [2019] UK UT 00065 which held that where
      the 10 years requirement was satisfied and there is nothing to
      indicate an application for indefinite leave to remain would be
      rejected then the appeal should be allowed. This was subject to any
      specific public interest factor which made the individual's removal
      proportionate. Section 3C leave continued in the situation where the
      leave expired without the application for variation having been
      decided.

  12. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that it was arguable
      that by the date of the appeal hearing the appellant had established
      10 years continuous lawful.

  13. At hearing, Mr Walker accepted a material error had been demonstrated
      in this regard. The appellant indeed had 10 years lawful residence and
      there were no other contrary factors. The judge had earlier said there
      were no section 117 B issues arising. I was invited to set the
      decision aside and remake it, allowing the appeal.

Conclusion

  14. In light of 3C and the agreed chronology I find the judge materially
      erred in concluding the continuation of time for lawful residence was
      dependent upon the appeal succeeding. In fact, by the time of the
      appeal the appellant did have 10 years continuous lawful residence. No
      other contrary factors arising, the appellant therefore would have
      been allowed to remain on this basis. Therefore, the respondent's
      decision to refuse her leave is disproportionate

Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Buckwell materially errs in law
and is set aside. I remake the decision allowing the appeal.
