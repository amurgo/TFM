Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr J Gajjar, Prime Law Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms K Pal, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The first Appellant is a national of Pakistan born on 6 December  1975.
    The second Appellant, Mrs Faheema, is his wife, and the third Appellant
    is his daughter, born on 20 January 2010.

 2. The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 29 September  2006  with
    leave to remain as a student for two years.  He subsequently applied in
    time for  further  leave,  firstly  under  the  International  Graduate
    Scheme, to 1 February 2009; then as a Tier 1 Post Study Migrant until 1
    February 2010 and subsequently as a Tier 4 student, to 27 October 2010.
    On 22 October 2010, the first Appellant applied for leave as a  Tier  1
    General Migrant, which application was refused on 10 November 2010. The
    first Appellant successfully appealed this  decision  and  was  granted
    further leave to 7 November 2013 and  Tier  1  leave  was  subsequently
    extended to 7 November 2016.

 3. On 28 October 2016, the first Appellant applied for indefinite leave to
    remain on the basis of 10 years continuous residence.  This application
    was refused on 25 January 2018 with reference to  paragraph  322(5)  of
    the Immigration Rules, on the basis that the Respondent considered that
    his character and conduct made it undesirable that  he  be  allowed  to
    remain in light of the fact that the level of  income  claimed  in  his
    previous visa applications was higher than that declared in his  income
    tax  returns,  which  suggested  a  misrepresentation  either  to   the
    Secretary of State or  to  HMRC.   The  Appellant's  dependants  having
    joined him on 20 January 2012, all three  Appellants  appealed  against
    this decision.

 4. Their appeals came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Farrelly for
    hearing on 25 September 2018.  In a decision and reasons promulgated on
    29 October 2018, the judge dismissed the appeal, finding at  [24]  that
    the first Appellant had not established that he had  made  an  innocent
    mistake for which his accountants were responsible and  found  that  it
    was thus undesirable he be permitted to remain in the UK.   In  respect
    of Article 8, the judge found that it would not be  in  his  daughter's
    best interests for her to remain in the UK and that she was of  an  age
    where she could adjust to life in Pakistan where she could be  provided
    for and where there  were  cultural  connections  and  extended  family
    members.

 5. Permission to appeal was  sought  in  time  on  a  number  of  grounds.
    Firstly, that the judge made a material error of fact or an  irrational
    finding in making reference to friends who have  been  able  to  advise
    him. It was contended the Appellant denied  ever  saying  that  he  had
    sought advice from friends and this was not contained  in  his  witness
    statement.  It was asserted also with  reference  to  paragraph  23(IV)
    that the fact that the Appellant is well  educated  does  not  mean  he
    would have necessarily spotted an error in his tax affairs  given  that
    he was not sufficiently versed in tax affairs in order to do that.

 6. Secondly, that the judge erred in applying the  incorrect  standard  of
    proof.  Following the case of R (ota Khan) JR/3097/2017 decision makers
    are required to consider whether  an  individual  has  been  honest  or
    merely careless; see also Shen [2014] UKUT 236.  It was argued that the
    Appellant's explanation has to be considered against the minimum  level
    of plausibility and that the judge's findings  at  [23](V)  as  to  the
    Appellant's  education  and  [23](VII)  that  the  judge  expected  the
    Appellant would  have  scrutinised  the  calculations  and  at  [23](X)
    demonstrated that he was applying too high a standard of proof.

 7. Ground 3 asserted that the judge made further material errors of  fact.
    At [2] in relation to the amount of self-employed earnings claimed, the
    judge asserted this was �11,138, whilst the correct figure was �21,229;
    at [4] in recording that the  Appellant  did  not  disclose  any  self-
    employment  in  his  un-amended  tax  return  when  this  is  factually
    incorrect, in that the Appellant's case was that he  had  declared  his
    self-employed income but his accountant without his  approval  declared
    net business losses which triggered a rebate of �2,382; at [6] that the
    Appellant did not disclose self-employment in relation to the 2013/2014
    tax return, which failed to take account of  the  Appellant's  evidence
    that the accountant under-declared his actual turnover  of  �12,460  to
    �2,150 and inflated his expenses from �5,550 to �10,395,  in  order  to
    generate a second rebate claimed to the accountant's personal  account.
    At [23](XI) it was contended  that  the  judge  erred  in  finding  the
    Appellant had prepared his own accounts for  2015  to  2016,  which  is
    incorrect given that the evidence before  the  Tribunal  was  that  the
    preparation, calculation and advice had been carried out by Qazi & Sons
    and submitted by the Appellant, and fifthly at [23](X)  in  failing  to
    take account of the Appellant's  explanation  for  the  timing  of  his
    amended returns.

 8. Ground 4 asserted that the judge had further erred in failing  to  have
    regard to material evidence:

      1) in failing to take account of a letter from Qazi &  Co  Accountants
         at AB53 to 55 stating that they had  scrutinised  his  tax  returns
         filed by his previous accountants, Tax Assist, and advised him that
         he had been given a rebate or a refund not because  of  tax  relief
         but because of under-declaration;

      2) at [21] when concluding the Appellant may be a burden  on  the  tax
         payer, the judge failed  to  have  regard  to  the  fact  that  the
         Appellant had paid the correct tax on the other tax years  and  has
         had no recourse to public funds and that the total tax paid by  him
         over six years amounted to �73,222.04;

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge  Parkes
    in a decision dated 7 December 2018.  After the grant of permission but
    prior to the hearing by the Upper Tribunal, the Appellant's  solicitors
    submitted further  documentation  pursuant  to  Rule  15(2)(a)  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  on  18  December  2018,
    copied to the Home Office  Presenting  Officers'  Unit.   This  was  an
    application to adduce further evidence, the further  evidence  being  a
    report from the Institute of Financial Accountants who investigated the
    Appellant's complaints against his former  accountant  and  sat  on  31
    October 2018 and 23 November 2018.  The committee, having sought  views
    from both the Appellant  and  from  his  former  accountant  Mr  Iqbal,
    concluded that the eight allegations made by the Appellant against  his
    former  accountant  disclosed  a  prima  facie  case  against  him  and
    supported an  allegation  of  dishonesty.   At  3.3  the  Investigation
    Committee stated as follows:

         "There was prima facie evidence of repeated errors in the return of
         tax returns for the years 2013 and 2014.   There  was  prima  facie
         evidence of allegations with regard to incorrect advice with regard
         to alleged tax  rebates  and  an  alleged  incorrect  profit  share
         agreement for the benefit of Mr Iqbal.  The Investigation Committee
         have particular concerns as to allegation (viii)  linked  with  the
         allegation that the monies were not paid into a  designated  client
         bank account".

    As a consequence of the committee's decision the matter was referred to
    the Disciplinary Committee of the Institute  of  Financial  Accountants
    and the Appellant was informed of this on 5 December 2018.

     Hearing

10. At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal, Mr Gajjar on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant stated that they had not  yet  been  given  a  date  for  the
    Disciplinary Committee but the Appellant had been told it would  be  in
    the new year.

11.  Ms  Pal  having  read  the  report  of  the  Investigation   Committee
    pragmatically accepted that this provided corroborative support for the
    basis of the Appellant's claim that it was his accountant  rather  than
    he who was dishonest and had made errors in his tax returns.   On  that
    basis she accepted that although this report was not before the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge given its substantiation of the  Appellant's  claim
    this did render the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Farrelly
    unsafe.

     Findings

12. In light of Ms Pal's helpful concession, I find that the evidence  from
    the Institute of Financial Accountants does cast doubt on the safety of
    the decision of Judge Farrelly, albeit it was not  before  him  at  the
    date  of  hearing  or  promulgation  of  the  decision.   Clearly   the
    Appellant's case stands or falls on the credibility of his claim not to
    have known that his accountant was acting dishonestly in preparation of
    two of his tax returns.

     Decision

13. The appeal is allowed to the extent that it is remitted for  a  hearing
    de novo before the First-tier Tribunal at Taylor House, to be heard  by
    a judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Farrelly.

Directions

 1) The appeal is to be listed for two and a half hours.

 2) If Listing could liaise with the clerks to Mr Turner and Mr  Gajjar  of
    Imperium Chambers on [~] that would be very helpful.

No anonymity order is made.
