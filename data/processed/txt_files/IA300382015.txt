                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born 13th  January  1983.   He
    has appealed with permission against the decision of Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Devittie promulgated on 25th October 2016, dismissing his
    appeal against the decision of the Respondent dated 18th  August  2015,
    refusing him leave to remain in the United Kingdom on  account  of  his
    Article 8 ECHR private/family life rights.

 2. The background to this appeal is that the Appellant arrived in  the  UK
    in October 2009 with leave to enter as a student, valid  to  2011.   He
    made various further applications relating to his leave,  but  for  the
    purposes of this decision it is relevant to note  that  an  application
    was made on 19th September 2014 for a Tier 2 -  General  Migrant  visa.
    This application was on the basis that he had been  offered  employment
    as a business development manager with an enterprise called Hill  House
    Nursing Home on an annual salary of ï¿½22,500.

 3. The Appellant withdrew  the  above  mentioned  Tier  2  application  in
    November 2014 and sought  to  vary  it  in  favour  of  an  application
    submitted on 29th April 2015 for leave to remain on the  basis  of  his
    family and  private  life.  The  reason  for  withdrawing  the  Tier  2
    application was on account  of  the  Appellant  being  unable  to  make
    contact with Hill House Nursing Home.  It  later  transpired  that  the
    certificate of sponsorship offering the post, which had been  submitted
    through a third party called Amita Solutions, was false. This  led  the
    Appellant to seek a variation application and it is  this  application,
    submitted on 29th April 2015 and refused  on  18th  August  2016  which
    forms the backdrop to the present appeal.

 4. When the Respondent refused the variation application,   the  Appellant
    appealed that refusal to the First-tier Tribunal saying:

       . He was  unaware  of  the  falsity  of  the  employment  sponsorship
         document

       . To refuse his application would be contrary to his Article 8 rights
         because:

          i) he had been in the UK since 2009;

         ii) he had obtained a Masters degree;

        iii) all he was seeking was some further time in order to obtain  a
             further sponsorship

 5. When his appeal  came  before  FtTJ  Devittie,  he  accepted  that  the
    Appellant  had  not  practised  deception  in  submitting   the   false
    sponsorship document although he did note "unsatisfactory features"  of
    the Appellant's evidence on this point.

 6. So far as the claim that the Respondent's refusal would contravene  the
    Appellant's private/family life, the judge  noted  that  the  Appellant
    could not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules in  particular
    paragraph 276ADE.  Indeed a concession  was  made  by  the  Appellant's
    representative on this point.  The  judge  noted  this  concession  and
    expressly said that any claim which the Appellant  had  was  one  based
    outside the Rules. It is this which he considered in [10].

 7. The judge concluded his decision in saying;

         ".... that there are no strong features of his  private  life  that
         would lead me  to  conclude,  that  the  imperatives  of  effective
         immigration control that I  have  identified,  must  yield  to  the
         seriousness  of  the  consequences  of   interference   with   this
         appellant's private life.  There are no serious consequences to his
         returning to Bangladesh, I would accordingly dismiss the article  8
         appeal."[10]

 8. The Appellant submitted grounds seeking permission.  There appear to be
    two strands to the grounds:

       . The judge dealt too narrowly with the evidence advanced  on  behalf
         of the Appellant in the  proportionality  exercise  and  failed  to
         attach sufficient cumulative weight  to  the  factors  advanced  in
         paragraph 4 above; and

       . the judge should have set out a fuller analysis of the  application
         of the criteria in Section 117(B) to the Rules.

 9. Permission having been granted the matter came before me as an error of
    law hearing in the Upper Tribunal.

Error of Law Hearing

10. I heard submissions from Mr Reza for the Appellant and Mr Avery for the
    Respondent.  Mr  Reza's  submissions  relied  on  the  grounds  seeking
    permission together with the grant of permission.  He  amplified  those
    grounds by emphasising that the Appellant is a man who has now been  in
    the UK for nine years.  He has studied hard and obtained  a  Master  of
    Business  Administration  Degree  in  November   2012   from   Coventry
    University.  Mr Reza further  submitted  that  what  the  Appellant  is
    seeking is some further time to find  suitable  employment/sponsorship.
    Indeed, he said, he should be given time to do so.

11. Further there was no analysis of Section 117B to the Rules and had  the
    judge looked at this properly, the Appellant  may  have  qualified  for
    leave.

12. Mr Avery filed a Rule 24 response.  He  submitted,  in  line  with  the
    response, that the judge had properly looked at  the  evidence  finding
    that the Respondent's decision caused no disproportionate  interference
    to the Appellant's private life.  So  far  as  Section  117B  point  is
    concerned  it  is  immaterial  in  this  case.  He  said  that  on   no
    construction of Section 117B would the Appellant be  able  to  succeed,
    given that he has been in the UK on a precarious basis only ever  since
    he first entered the UK.  Therefore  no  substantial  weight  could  be
    attributed to his educational qualifications or financial independence.

Consideration

13. The task before me at this stage is to consider whether the decision of
    the FtT  Judge  contains  material  error  sufficient  to  vitiate  the
    decision and set it aside.  I am satisfied that  the  decision  of  FtT
    Devittie is sustainable and I now give my reasons for this.

14. The main criticism against the judge is that he somehow failed to  look
    at the evidence advanced on behalf of the  Appellant  holistically  and
    therefore misdirected himself.  I disagree with this assessment.

15. Firstly it is clear from a reading of  the  decision,  that  the  judge
    accepted that the Appellant had established a  private  life  and  that
    removal would cause interference with that.  The judge  refers  to  the
    relevant evidence in [10] and there is nothing in the decision to  show
    that the judge has simply sidelined that evidence.  He sets  out  fully
    and acknowledges in [10]  that  the  Appellant  has  attained  academic
    qualifications, but balances this by saying that there is no suggestion
    he could not put these to use in Bangladesh.  Therefore the  judge  has
    clearly kept that matter in mind.

16. He goes on to say that the Appellant is seeking a period  of  leave  to
    find yet another Sponsor but balances against this the fact that  there
    was no evidence to show any progress in finding a Sponsor.  So  far  as
    the suggestion that the Appellant's removal would leave  him  destitute
    in Bangladesh is concerned, the judge deals with that point  by  saying
    that no evidence was put forward to show  that  there  were  any  great
    obstacles to the Appellant returning to Bangladesh. Indeed it  is  hard
    to see how a man with the Appellant's educational qualifications  would
    be in danger of becoming destitute on return to his own country.

17. Dealing with the claim that there is a  lack  of  analysis  of  Section
    117B, I find force in Mr Avery's  point.   I  bear  in  mind  that  the
    Appellant's immigration status has been precarious throughout  and  the
    fact that it has been conceded on his behalf that he  cannot  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules, leads me to the conclusion  that
    a fuller analysis of Section 117B would be fruitless.

18. Accordingly for the foregoing reason I find that the  decision  of  FtT
    Judge Devittie is sustainable.  That decision  therefore  stands.   The
    appeal before me is dismissed.
