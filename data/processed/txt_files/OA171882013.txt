For the Respondent:    Mr Z Naseem, instructed by Yakub & Co Solicitors




                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Entry  Clearance  Officer,  Paris,  against  a
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal issued on 29 July 2014 allowing  an
    appeal by the applicant against the  decision  made  on  27  June  2013
    refusing her leave to enter as the spouse of a  UK  citizen.   In  this
    decision I will refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier
    Tribunal the applicant as the appellant and the Entry Clearance Officer
    as the respondent.

Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of  Algeria  born  on  27  July  1983.   She
    married her husband, the sponsor, in Algeria on 29 March 2009 and  they
    have a daughter born on 17 September 2010.  The applicant  applied  for
    entry clearance on 5 June 2013 as a spouse.  However,  her  application
    was refused on the basis firstly that the respondent was not  satisfied
    that the relationship was genuine and subsisting or  that  the  parties
    intended to live together permanently in the  UK.   The  appellant  had
    failed to provide any evidence of contact with the sponsor in the  form
    of photographs, dated Skype messages, flight tickets or entry clearance
    stamps.  He was also not satisfied that the financial  requirements  of
    the rules were met in that she failed to show that her  sponsor  had  a
    gross income of at least �18,600 per annum.  She  had  stated  that  he
    earned in excess of �22,400 per annum commencing employment in February
    2012 with Slough Borough Council, the position  becoming  permanent  in
    October 2012 but six months payslips  were  provided  which  showed  an
    annual gross salary of �16,790.24.

 3. There was also evidence that the sponsor was employed by Greater London
    Food Company (GLFC) but this employment only  commenced  on  1  January
    2013.  There was a failure to provide documents to show  the  sponsor's
    wage slips for 12 months with Slough Borough Council from 5  June  2012
    to 5 June 2013, the date of application, his bank  statements  for  the
    same period showing the payment of wages into his bank  account  or  an
    official  letter  signed  from  GLFC  confirming  his  employment,  the
    position within the  organisation  and  whether  it  was  permanent  or
    temporary.  The respondent also noted that the appellant had provided a
    P60 for tax year 25 April 2013 for GLFC showing that tax  to  date  was
    �1,500 in this employment but the last  payslip  dated  31  March  2013
    showed gross pay of �5,500 and therefore the payslips and the  P60  for
    this employment did not correspond.

 4. The appellant appealed against  this  decision  and  the  grounds  were
    submitted with a number of further documents.  The decision  to  refuse
    the application was reviewed by an entry clearance manager and  in  the
    light of further evidence it was conceded  that  the  relationship  was
    genuine.   However,  with  regards   to   maintenance   the   financial
    requirement was calculated by taking the past six months gross earnings
    dividing by 6 and multiplying by 12. For  the  employment  with  Slough
    Borough Council this equated to �17,759.40 per annum evidenced  by  the
    required documents, payslips,  corroborating  bank  statements  and  an
    employer's  letter.   However,  for  the  employment  with  GLFC   bank
    statements had not been received to corroborate the claimed earnings as
    stipulated in  the  rules.   Attempts  had  been  made  to  verify  the
    authenticity of the documents from GLFC including checks on 192.com and
    BT directory, neither of which showed any contact details.  A search at
    Companies House showed that this company  was  only  registered  on  16
    January 2013 despite the sponsor's payslip from  January  2013  showing
    year to date earnings implying that he had been employed for  the  full
    financial year earning �500 per month,  (the  �4,500  total  gross  pay
    would equal  nine  months  pay).   There  were  no  corroborating  bank
    statements and accordingly these claimed earnings could  not  be  taken
    into account.

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 5. At the hearing before the judge it  was  submitted  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent that the sponsor had not showed the  required  earnings  and
    that the income from GLFC should not be taken  into  account  as  there
    were no bank statements to corroborate the claimed earnings as required
    by the rules.  The start date of the employment should be on the letter
    from GLFC and the sponsor did not have enough savings to  make  up  the
    shortfall.  It was argued on behalf of the appellant that  the  sponsor
    had shown his earnings through payslips  and  bank  evidence.   He  had
    obtained a new job from 1 April 2014 and the  financial  threshold  was
    met.

 6. The judge set out his findings of fact and law as follows:

             "16 The appellant states in his witness  statement  of  2  June
             2013 that he commenced employment with GLFC in January 2013 and
             continued until 31 October 2013. He has submitted payslips from
             May 2013 to October 2013. The  company  commenced  business  in
             January 2013. I found the sponsor to be a credible witness  and
             accept that his  employment  commenced  in  January  2013-  the
             payslips do not indicate anything to the contrary. The payslips
             from May 2013 to October 2013 appear to be genuine. There is no
             evidence to suggest otherwise. The sponsor was paid in cash.  I
             find that the appellant's total earnings comfortably  meet  the
             �18,600 requirement.


             17 I have carefully considered the bank statements submitted by
             the appellant. The Natwest bank statements from 19  March  2013
             to 2 September 2013 show  various  cash  credits  resulting  in
             total savings of �8290 by 2 September 2013. I am satisfied that
             the cash credits represent the sponsor's  surplus  income  from
             GLFC and therefore corroborate his claimed earnings  from  that
             employer.


             18 The sponsor's income is the only matter in dispute under the
             Rules and therefore I am satisfied that all of the requirements
             are met."


 7. In the event that he was wrong under the rules the  judge  went  on  to
    consider article 8 outside the rules.  He found that the appellant  and
    their daughter had developed a strong degree of private and family life
    with the sponsor who resided in the UK and that refusal would interfere
    with that right.   On  the  issue  of  proportionality,  this  involved
    striking a fair balance between the rights of  the  appellant  and  the
    public interest.  The judge took into account  the  best  interests  of
    their daughter finding that it was in her best interests to  reside  in
    the UK with both parents as she was a UK citizen and  entitled  to  the
    benefits of UK education and healthcare.  She could not come to the  UK
    unless  her  mother  had  leave  to  enter.   There  was  evidence,  he
    commented, that the sponsor had sufficient income to support his family
    in the UK and had a new part time job to replace  the  GLFC  post.   He
    found that the public interest in exclusion on income grounds was  very
    weak.  Accordingly, the appeal was  allowed  on  both  immigration  and
    human rights grounds.


The grounds and Submissions

 8. The respondent was granted  permission  to  appeal  for  the  following
    reasons:

           "... 2 It is arguable that the entire approach by the  judge  to
           the appeal was flawed. Arguably the judge failed to identify the
           issues of fact  that  were  in  dispute,  or  to  make  adequate
           findings of fact upon the  relevant  evidence,  before  deciding
           that the requirements of the immigration rules were met.  If  he
           had done so, then it is difficult  to  see  how  he  could  have
           reached the decision he did.


           3 Equally it is arguable that the entire approach taken  to  the
           article 8  appeal  was  fundamentally  flawed,  and  displays  a
           misunderstanding  or,  failure  to  apply  the  principles   and
           guidance set out in MM to which the judge referred  himself.  If
           the judge was entitled to find, and did  find,  that  after  the
           date of the decision the appellant had met the  requirements  of
           the immigration Rules then he failed to identify any reason  why
           the appellant should not be expected to make a fresh application
           relying upon that change in circumstances. If the appellant  did
           not meet those requirements then the judge  failed  to  identify
           what  was  disproportionate  about  the  expectation  that   the
           appellant's spouse and child should live with  her  in  Algeria;
           that child  being  a  dual  national  of  Algeria  and  Britain.
           Arguably the Judge failed to have any  adequate  regard  to  the
           public interest, or to the proper approach to  the  question  of
           proportionality in the light of the guidance to be found in  the
           Court of Appeal's decision in MM."

 9. Mr Duffy adopted the  respondent's  grounds  of  appeal  which  can  be
    summarised as follows.  The rules set out in appendix FM-SE what  types
    of evidence were required, the period they covered and the format  they
    should be in and the appellant had  failed  to  produce  the  necessary
    evidence to show the sponsor had the required earnings.  There were  no
    bank statements to corroborate all the claimed  earnings,  a  mandatory
    requirement of the rules.  Further, the judge did not have  appropriate
    regard to the relevant  date,  the  date  of  application,  or  to  the
    requirement that the required evidence must be for the specified period
    before that date.  The judge did not address the period  prior  to  the
    date  of  application  when  attempting  to  find  that  the  financial
    requirements could be met through  the  new  employment  and  therefore
    reached an unsustainable conclusion.  The judge, so he argued,  applied
    his own methods of calculation ignoring the requirements of appendix FM-
    SE.  It was not clear or substantiated what the sponsor's actual  gross
    income was at the date of application.  If the sponsor's current income
    exceeded the income threshold, there was no reason to prevent  a  fresh
    application being made on that basis.

10. So far as article 8 was concerned, the Rules required appendix FM to be
    the route for those seeking entry on the basis of  their  family  life.
    When considering whether the appeal should  be  allowed  on  article  8
    grounds, the judge failed to follow the guidance in Nagre  v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department  [2013] EWHC 720  (Admin)  or  Gulshan
    (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640  (IAC).   In
    any event, the appellant and sponsor could continue their  family  life
    together in Algeria and article 8 should not be used to circumvent  the
    Immigration Rules.  There was no analysis of why  the  appellant  could
    not submit a further application or why it would be unjustifiably harsh
    to require her to do so.

11. Further, the sponsor  could  not  evidence  his  second  employment  as
    required under the mandatory requirements of appendix  FM-SE  and  that
    income therefore could not be  taken  into  account.   The  couple  had
    married in Algeria and there could have been no legitimate  expectation
    that family life could necessarily be  established  in  the  UK.  There
    would be no disproportionate effect on the best interests of the  child
    who as a British citizen could join her father in the UK if her  family
    wished her to do so.

12. Mr Duffy summarised the grounds by submitting that the  findings  under
    the immigration rules were inadequate and wrong as the appellant  could
    not meet the requirements of FM-SE and the appeal should not have  been
    allowed under article 8 as there was no  additional  factor  justifying
    that course.  In substance, the judge was permitting reliance on a near
    miss argument.

13. Mr Naseem submitted that the determination  had  to  be  put  into  its
    proper context. The application had been supported by further documents
    which had been accepted by the entry clearance manager in  relation  to
    the genuine nature of the relationship. On the basis  of  the  accepted
    evidence there was a limited shortfall of �840 from the required  level
    of �18,600.  The judge had accepted the evidence about the primary  and
    secondary employment and was entitled to consider the evidence  in  the
    light of the review by the entry clearance manager.

14. So far as article 8 was concerned Mr Naseem argued that the  judge  had
    properly applied the relevant jurisprudence giving proper weight to the
    fact that there was a British citizen child.  He was also  entitled  to
    comment that the public interest in exclusion  on  income  grounds  was
    very weak in the light of the small  shortfall.  Appendix  FM  did  not
    include all matters relevant to an assessment of private life  and  the
    judge had been entitled to go on to consider the matter  under  article
    8.

Assessment of the Issues

15. The first issue for me to decide is whether the judge erred in law such
    that his decision should be set aside.  I am satisfied that he did  err
    in law both in respect of the immigration rules  and  article  8.   The
    provisions of appendix FM set out the requirements to be  met  when  an
    application is made by a  spouse  and  appendix  FM-SE  identifies  the
    evidence to be provided.  The financial requirements must be  supported
    by specific evidence for the period of six months prior to the date  of
    application, in this case up to 5 June 2013.  The evidence relating  to
    the employment with  Slough  Borough  Council  was  duly  evidenced  as
    required  with  payslips,  corroborating  bank   statements   and   the
    employer's letter and equated to �17,759.40. The appellant also  sought
    to rely on  the  sponsor's  employment  with  GLFC  but  this  was  not
    supported by the required evidence.  Further, it is  clear  that  there
    were concerns as set out in  the  entry  clearance  manager's  decision
    about the reliability of a number of documents.  In any event the extra
    �500 per month would not have taken the income up to the required level
    for the relevant period.  It  was  not  open  to  the  judge  to  do  a
    recalculation covering a period from May 2013 to  October  2013  or  to
    take into account the new  part  time  employment  replacing  the  GLFC
    employment.

16. On the basis of the evidence produced in support of the application and
    subsequently,  the  appellant  was  not  able  to  meet  the  financial
    requirements of the rules.  I am  not  satisfied  as  submitted  by  Mr
    Naseem that the entry clearance manager review should be  the  starting
    point.  The appeal is against  the  original  decision  and  the  entry
    clearance  manager  was  simply  and  accurately  explaining  why  that
    decision was maintained on financial grounds.

17. I am also satisfied that the judge erred  in  the  way  he  dealt  with
    article 8.  In the light of further evidence submitted, it may well  be
    the case that a further application would be successful.  However, that
    without more does not justify the appeal being allowed under article  8
    so  circumventing  the  requirements  of  the  immigration  rules.  The
    assessment of article 8 must  be  carried  out  in  the  light  of  the
    requirements of the rules and the judge should have considered  whether
    there were any particular circumstances  justifying  the  appeal  being
    further considered under article 8 in the light of the failure to  meet
    the requirements of the rules.

18. The judge was of course right to take into account the  best  interests
    of the child of the family but the fact of the  matter  is  that  their
    daughter is 4, has been living with her mother in  Algeria  and  whilst
    being a British citizen is also an Algerian citizen.  In the  light  of
    the evidence that a further application was  likely  to  be  successful
    there has been no consideration of why it would not be  reasonable  for
    such an application to be made.  The judge commented  that  the  public
    interest in exclusion on income grounds was very weak but  this  wholly
    overlooks the public interest in requiring that an applicant is able to
    meet the financial requirements of the rules and  more  generally  that
    there should be a predictable and consistent system of rules  by  which
    applications are assessed.  For these reasons, I am satisfied that  the
    error of law is such that the decision should be set aside.

Re-making the Decision

19. Both representatives were satisfied that if the decision was set  aside
    I should re-make it on the basis of the submissions I have heard.   For
    the reasons I have already given the appellant was not and is still not
    able to show that she could meet  the  financial  requirements  of  the
    rules for the prescribed period.  The appeal under the  rules  must  be
    dismissed.

20. So far as article 8 is concerned I am not satisfied that there are  any
    compelling or exceptional factors falling outside the rules which would
    justify the decision being allowed on article 8 grounds.  It is  not  a
    question  of  applying  a  test  of  exceptionality  or   a   threshold
    requirement before article 8 can be considered.  The position  here  is
    that there is evidence to support the contention that the appellant  if
    she  made  a  fresh  application  would  now  be  able  to  meet  those
    requirements although it must be for the  entry  clearance  officer  to
    assess the application on the basis of the evidence  provided.   It  is
    not unreasonable to expect an application to be made in accordance with
    the rules. The best interests of the child of the family must be  taken
    into account but that is in the context of the fact that she  continues
    to live with her mother in Algeria although this may not  be  for  much
    longer if the requirements of the rules can be met.  It is  also  right
    to take into account that the couple married in Algeria and there could
    have been no legitimate expectation that family life could  necessarily
    be established in the UK in the absence of being able  to  comply  with
    rules.

21. I am not  satisfied  that  there  are  any  further  circumstances  not
    sufficiently recognised under the new rules to  justify  the  grant  of
    leave under article 8.  Whilst the decision engages article 8(1)  I  am
    satisfied, even taking due account of the best interests of  the  child
    of this family  as  a  primary  consideration,  that  the  decision  is
    proportionate to the legitimate aim of requiring  compliance  with  the
    immigration rules as part of protecting the economic well-being of  the
    country.

Decision

22. The First-tier Tribunal erred in law and the decision is set aside.   I
    re-make the decision by  dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal  on  both
    immigration and human rights grounds.
