For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


1.   The appellant, a citizen of  Afghanistan,  born  on  5  February  1978,
    appeals, with permission, against a determination of Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal  Chana  who,  in  a  determination  dated  11  June  2013
    dismissed the appellant's appeal against a decision of the Secretary of
    State  to  refuse  him  asylum  and  to  issue  removal  directions  to
    Afghanistan.

2.   The basis of the appellant's claim to asylum was  that  he  had  worked
    for a garage in Jalalabad specialising in engines  and  gearboxes.   In
    January 2010 he started repairing Humvees  vehicles  belonging  to  the
    United States Armed  Forces.   In  February  2013  he  had  received  a
    telephone call from a person who had identified himself as a member  of
    the Taliban who had told him that he was committing a sin by  repairing
    vehicles which were used by the American forces against fellow Muslims.
    He had then received a letter which had stated that  the  person    who
    had written to him was a member of the Taliban and that he  should  pay
    3,000,000 Afghani by the end of the week.  He then received  a  further
    telephone call asking if  he  had  received  the  letter.   Finally  he
    received a call asking if he had made arrangements for the money.   The
    appellant said that he had not yet made such arrangements  but  he  had
    had no intention in any event of giving the Taliban any money.

3.   The appellant then  left  Jalalabad  for  Kabul,  changing  his  mobile
    telephone number.

4.   While he was there four members of the Taliban had gone to his home  in
    Jalalabad and threatened his family.  His  mother,  under  duress,  had
    provided them with his new mobile number and his photographs.

5.   The Taliban then contacted the appellant twice in  March  2013  telling
    him to return to Jalalabad and stating that if he did not  the  Taliban
    in Kabul would find him and kill him.  The appellant had  not  returned
    but instead made arrangements for his mother wife and children to go to
    Pakistan to live with his father-in-law. He then made  arrangements  to
    leave and come to Britain.

6.   The Secretary of State did not find  that  the  appellant's  claim  was
    credible and refused the application.   The appellant appealed.

7.   The Judge  noted  his  evidence  and  in  paragraphs  29  onwards  made
    detailed findings  of  fact.   She  did  not  find  the  appellant  was
    credible.  In paragraph 36 she noted that he had said that the  gearbox
    had five gears plus an additional help gear but had then stated that it
    had "five speeds" and that "the gear is made up of  five  elements.  N-
    Neutral P- Parking D-Drive R-Reserve and L-Low gear". She said that the
    background evidence stated that the transmission in the Humvees used by
    the Americans was a three speed automatic.  She said that the appellant
    had been equally vague about the mechanics  of  a  car  and  that  that
    demonstrated he had never worked on American Humvees or that he  was  a
    mechanic.

8.   She added to say there was no  evidence  had  been  provided  that  the
    United States Army would outsource the servicing and repairs  of  their
    vehicles to a local garage in Afghanistan and stated:

         "I do not find it at all credible that the  American  Armed  Forces
         would put their cars and personnel at risk and instead of repairing
         their vehicles with their own mechanics and  their  own  engineers,
         they would  send  their  vehicles  outside  their  compound  to  be
         repaired by Afghan nationals."

9.   The Judge said that  that she did not accept that the  appellant  would
    have been  paid 100,000 Afghani by the owner of  the  garage  where  he
    worked as that was the equivalent of ï¿½1,200 per month. She next  stated
    that she did not believe that the Taliban would make three requests  to
    the appellant for money and not think  the  appellant  would  run  away
    which in fact was what he did.  She placed weight on the fact that  the
    owner of the garage where the appellant worked  had  not  himself  been
    targeted.

10.   The appellant had sought asylum in Belgium in 2007 because  he  feared
    being killed in a family dispute  and had then returned to  Afghanistan
    because his father had a medical condition. The  Judge  stated  that  a
    genuine refugee would  not   return  to  a  country  where  he   feared
    persecution.  She added that  she did not believe  the  authorities  in
    Kabul had told the appellant that they could not protect themselves and
    therefore could not offer a mere mechanic protection.

11.  The judge also stated that she found the  appellant's  credibility  was
    damaged by the fact that he had said  that  he  did  not  know  another
    Afghani who was in Harmondsworth Detention Centre whose appeal she  had
    heard immediately before that of this appellant. She placed weight also
    on the fact that that appellant had produced  a  certificate  from  the
    provincial reconstruction team in Nangarhar which stated that it was  a
    certificate of appreciation presented to mechanical "Gul Mohamed  Khan"
    which had been signed by the head mechanic and the  lead  engineer  and
    the commander of the US Army Corps of Engineers in Jalalabad.

12.  The grounds claimed that the judge had erred in law in her findings  of
    credibility and that she had reached negative findings  of  credibility
    without evidence on which to reach those findings.

13.  Miss Jones, in her submissions to me amplified the grounds  of  appeal.
    She first argued that the judge  had  made  an  assumption  that  local
    nationals would not employed by the American Army.  In that regard  she
    referred to a number of  documents  relating  to  the  maintenance  and
    supply of operational  support in Afghanistan by  a  company  known  as
    AECOM which said that it employed 5,100 persons spread across almost 50
    locations and referred to one of the aims of the AECOM contact  of  the
    US Army  being  to  "develop  and  train  local  nationals  in  vehicle
    maintenance operations which had not been  before the First-tier Judge.
     Secondly she stated that the judge  had  made  an  assumption  that  a
    person seeking asylum would not return to his home  country  to  see  a
    parent who was unwell.

14.  There was nothing to show that  the  appellant  would  have  known  the
    other Afghani  in  the  Harmondsworth  Detention  Centre  -  the  judge
    certainly did not know how many people were detained there. She  stated
    that Harmondsworth Detention Centre had a rapidly  changing  population
    of up to 620 single male adults.

15.  The judge had referred to the  gearbox  in  the  Humvees  as  being  an
    automatic three speed gearbox but the reality was that Humvees vehicles
    had been used by the American forces since 1981 in a bewildering number
    of types and options. Moreover the judge had nothing on which  to  base
    the assertion that the appellant's claimed salary was too  high  to  be
    plausible. Finally she  had  no  evidence  on  which  to  suggest  that
    maintenance work on vehicles would not be outsourced by the US Army.

16.  In reply Mr Melvin argued that although he accepted that  some  matters
    on which the judge relied were clearly speculative  and  in  particular
    he accepted that the appellant might well, in 2007,  have  returned  to
    Afghanistan to see a sick relative, the  reality  was  that  the  judge
    reached conclusions which were fully open to her on  the  evidence  and
    indeed reflected the comments  made  in  the  letter  of  refusal.   He
    objected to the further evidence  which  had  been  submitted  by  Miss
    Jones, stating, of course, that it would not be an  error  of  law  for
    that not to have been taken into account by the judge. He  argued  that
    the judge had pointed out contradictory evidence and that in any  event
    the appellant had not produced evidence to back up the  various  claims
    he had made on matters  such  as   his  salary.   He  referred  to  the
    criticisms of the documents of appreciation which he argued  did  show,
    as the judge had indicated, grammatical mistakes. He also  argued  that
    the judge was entitled not to  believe  that  the  appellant  had  been
    contacted by the Taliban who would, if the appellant were to  believed,
    have been able to kill him in Kabul.

17.  I find that there are material errors of law in  the  determination  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge. I am concerned that many of her findings
    appear to be based on speculation and there was no  evidence  on  which
    she could  reach the findings which she did.  These matters include her
    belief that the appellant was not telling the truth when he  said  that
    he did not know the  appellant  in  the  previous  case  who  was  also
    detained at Harmondsworth - given the size of  Harmondsworth  it  would
    not be impossible for the appellant not to know the other Afghan -  and
    her conclusion that the appellant had sought asylum in Belgium claiming
    a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution  in  Afghanistan  but  had  been
    untruthful when he had made that claim, as was shown by the  fact  that
    he had returned to Afghanistan.  The reality is that an  asylum  seeker
    might well return to their own country if they feel  that  they  should
    return to see an extremely ill parent.

18.  Moreover, I do not  fully  understand  the  point  made  by  the  judge
    regarding the number of gears in a Humvee.  I consider that  the  point
    is well made that there are many types of that vehicle in operation and
    therefore there is likely to be variety to gear  systems,  but  in  any
    event the reality is that the appellant, although  naming  five  gears,
    only three of these referred to motion - drive, reverse and  low.   The
    appellant was,  of  course,  correct  to  state  that  the  gears  were
    automatic.

19.  There was also no basis  on  which  the  judge  could  comment  on  the
    appellant's salary or, if there was, she  gave  no  reason  other  than
    stating that she did not believe that the  appellant  was  telling  the
    truth.

20.  Finally the judge, who, as Miss Jones pointed out,  made  a  number  of
    typographical errors in the determination, was, I  consider,  incorrect
    to  state  that  the  certificates  of  appreciation  produced  by  the
    appellant were clearly not genuine.  I can see no reason, on  the  face
    of them, for reaching that conclusion.

21.  I therefore set aside the determination of the Judge and I direct  that
    the appeal proceed to a hearing afresh on all issues.

22.  I would add that there are a number of matters such as  the  number  of
    gears in the Humvees,  the  way  in  which  local  mechanics  might  be
    employed in the service of the UN forces and  the  genuineness  of  the
    certificates of appreciation on which there should be further  evidence
    which could be obtained relatively easily.  In  particular  I  consider
    that there may  well  be  some  way  in  which  those  who  signed  the
    certificates of appreciation could  be contacted.  I consider that  the
    onus is on both parties and not merely on the appellant to ascertain if
    further evidence regarding those certificates  and  the  other  matters
    which I have mentioned can be obtained.

23.  Having set aside the determination of the judge I have  also  concluded
    that this is  an  appropriate  case  in  which,  following  the  Senior
    President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2(a)  are  met  and  that
    therefore the appeal should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

Decision

     This appeal is allowed to the limited extent that  it  is  remitted  to
    the First-tier Tribunal for a hearing afresh.

Direction
         I direct that the appeal be heard again in the  First-tier  on  all
    isssues.
