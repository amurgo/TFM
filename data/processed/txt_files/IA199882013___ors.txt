For the Appellant:     Not legally represented
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, HOPO






                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellants have been granted permission to appeal the
    determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Cameron in which he
    dismissed the appeals of the appellants against the decision of the
    respondent made on 17 May 2013 to refuse their applications for leave
    to remain on the basis of family and private life in the UK.

2.   The first appellant attended the hearing with her mother and the third
    appellant.

2.   The appellants are citizens of the Philippines.  The first appellant
    is the mother of the second and third appellants.  The appellants came
    to the UK on 23 December 2012 with valid leave as visitors until 30
    April 2013.  They applied for leave to remain on 22 March 2013.

3.   The judge's findings are set out at paragraphs 32 to 55.

4.   The appellants were granted permission to appeal by First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Ford who said it is arguable that in not considering and
    making findings on the best interests of the 2nd and 3 appellants,
    Judge Cameron may have made a material error of law.

5.   I find that the judge did not make an error of law.  The appellants
    were unrepresented at the hearing before the judge. The judge heard
    oral evidence from the first appellant.  She adopted her statement
    dated 25 March 2014 subject to an amendment at paragraph 5 and also
    adopted her statement dated 15 March 2012.  I accepted Mr. Wildings'
    submission that the judge encapsulated the evidence, weighed it up and
    made his decision.  The decision included a finding at paragraph 52
    that the best interests of the children are to remain with their mother
    and to grow up in their own culture.  The judge's finding was perfectly
    sustainable on the evidence that was before him.

6.   I find that permission to appeal should not have been granted in this
    case.

7.   The judge's decision dismissing the appeals of the appellants shall
    stand.
