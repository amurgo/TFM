For the Appellant:     Mr Holmes, Counsel instructed by Legal Justice
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Afghanistan born in 1980. Her dependents
    are her husband and three children.

 2. The Appellant and  her  family  members  have  been  trying  to  secure
    international protection in the United Kingdom since at least  the  8th
    August 2016 when they are recorded as having arrived at London Gatwick.
    At first it was the Appellant's husband who claimed  asylum,  with  the
    Appellant and their children as his dependents. That claim  failed  and
    the subsequent appeal had been dismissed by First-tier Tribunal  Smith,
    in a decision dated 14th March 2017. On the 4th July 2018 the Appellant
    herself claimed asylum, this time with  other  family  members  as  her
    dependents. The Appellant's claim was refused on the 31st December 2018
    and the Appellant appealed.

 3. When the appeal  came  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Herwald  in
    February 2019 some matters were not in issue. The family were  accepted
    by the Respondent  to  be  nationals  of  Afghanistan,  and  they  were
    accepted to be Sikhs. The relevant country guidance for the  assessment
    of the  risk  of  persecution  for  reasons  of  religious  belief  was
    therefore TG (Afghan Sikhs etc) Afghanistan CG [2015]  UKUT  595.   The
    Appellant and her dependents further  submitted  that  their  religious
    identity placed them at an enhanced risk of  ill-treatment  within  the
    framework  of   Article   15(c)   of   the   Qualification   Directive.
    Alternatively, it was  submitted  that  there  were  "very  significant
    obstacles" to the family's integration in  Afghanistan  such  that  the
    appeals should be allowed on Article 8 grounds  pursuant  to  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal noted that this was not  the  first  time  that
    this family had pursued an appeal on protection grounds.  Applying  the
    principle in Devaseelan [2002] UKIAT 00702  and  TK  (Consideration  of
    Prior Determination - Directions)  Georgia  [2004]  UKIAT  00149  Judge
    Herwald treated Judge Smith's decision  as  his  starting  point.   The
    effect of that was that neither the Appellant nor her husband  were  to
    be treated as credible witnesses; their account of why they had decided
    to leave Afghanistan was rejected.  Judge Herwald did not  accept  that
    they feared for their life there, noting inter alia that the family had
    been living in Russia for many years (where all of the  three  children
    had  been  born)  but  had  voluntarily  returned  to  Kabul  in  2016.
    Accordingly he dismissed the appeals.

 5. The Appellant sought permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.  She
    was granted such permission on the 8th October  2019  by  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Davey.

 6. On the 18th November 2019 the matter came before me at  the  Manchester
    Civil Justice Centre. The grounds of appeal were  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had erred in law in the following material respects:

      i)  Failing  to  make  findings  on  the  Article  15(c)   claim   for
         humanitarian protection; and

     ii) Likewise failing to make any findings at  all  on  whether  removal
         would  result  in  a   disproportionate   interference   with   the
         Appellant's private  life  as  protected  by  Article  8,  such  an
         assessment  required  by   the   United   Kingdom's   international
         obligations under the  ECHR  and  by  paragraph  276ADE(1)  of  the
         Immigration Rules.

 7. Before me Mr Bates accepted that both grounds were made  out.  Although
    the Tribunal had rejected  in  clear  terms  the  historical  narrative
    advanced by the Appellant - these findings not being challenged in this
    appeal - the Secretary of State agreed that the Tribunal had failed  to
    make any finding on the  two  matters  raised  in  the  grounds.    The
    Appellant had submitted that the situation for Sikhs was such that they
    fell within an Elgafaji enhanced risk category, and that their  ability
    to lead meaningful private lives in Afghanistan was severely curtailed.
       Neither  myself  nor  Mr  Bates  could  find  any  evidence  in  the
    determination  that   these   arguments   had   been   addressed.   The
    determination did contain a wider Article 8  assessment,  but  did  not
    specifically address the question of "very significant  obstacles".  By
    my written decision of the  19th  November  2019  I  ordered  that  the
    decision of Judge Herwald be set aside to that extent,  in  order  that
    those matters can be determined.

 8. The matter was relisted before me on the 14th  February  2020,  when  I
    heard submissions from the parties on the matters  outstanding.   There
    has since been a delay in promulgation of a  decision,  for  which  the
    parties  have  my  apologies.  Immediately  following  the  hearing  in
    February I was unwell, and I was then on leave.  I had  been  intending
    to deal with this case upon my return from leave but due to the special
    measures put in place to deal with the Covid-19  pandemic  I  was  then
    unable to access the file, held at Field House.  On the 27th May 2020 I
    notified the parties that the file was then in my possession and that I
    intended to proceed to remaking the decision in the appeal. I made  the
    following directions:

         "I am conscious that since I heard submissions the  Upper  Tribunal
         has promulgated the decision in AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan CG
         [2020] UKUT 00130 (IAC). In view of  the  Appellant's  reliance  on
         Article 15(c) I consider that it would be appropriate to  now  give
         the parties an opportunity to address that  decision,  should  they
         wish to do so. Given that the bulk of  the  submissions  have  been
         made it seems to me that this could be done without  difficulty  by
         remote hearing".

 9. In response to these directions Mr Bates on behalf  of  the  Respondent
    sent in a brief note inviting me to determine the appeal  in  light  of
    the applicable country guidance. For the Appellant Mr Holmes  took  the
    opportunity to file  further  written  argument.  I  have  taken  those
    written submissions, and indeed all the submissions and  evidence  into
    account in reaching my decision. I am grateful to the parties for their
    assistance and again apologise for the length of time it has taken  for
    this decision to be issued.

    Legal Framework

10. Article 15 of the Qualification Directive[1] reads:

         'Serious harm consists of:

          a) Death penalty or execution

          b)  Torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of an
             applicant in the country of origin; or

          c) Serious and individual threat to a civilian's life  or  person
             by  reason  of  indiscriminate  violence  in   situations   of
             international or internal armed conflict.'

11. In the 2009 case of Elgafaji v Staatsecretaris van Justitie  (C-465/07)
    the European Court of Justice  gave  guidance  on  the  application  of
    Article 15(c). It held that unlike the matters covered by (a)  and  (b)
    thereof, part (c)  of  the  article  did  not  require  the  individual
    claimant to establish a personal risk.  Article  15(c)  covers  a  more
    general risk of harm:

         "34  Reference is made, more generally,  to  a  'threat  ...  to  a
             civilian's life or person' rather than  to  specific  acts  of
             violence. Furthermore, that threat is inherent  in  a  general
             situation  of  'international  or  internal  armed  conflict'.
             Lastly, the violence in question  which  gives  rise  to  that
             threat is described as 'indiscriminate', a term which  implies
             that it may extend to people irrespective  of  their  personal
             circumstances.

         35   In that context, the word 'individual' must be  understood  as
             covering harm to civilians  irrespective  of  their  identity,
             where the degree of indiscriminate violence characterising the
             armed conflict  taking  place  -  assessed  by  the  competent
             national  authorities  before   which   an   application   for
             subsidiary protection is made, or by the courts  of  a  Member
             State to which a decision  refusing  such  an  application  is
             referred - reaches such a high level that substantial  grounds
             are shown for believing  that  a  civilian,  returned  to  the
             relevant country or, as the  case  may  be,  to  the  relevant
             region, would, solely  on  account  of  his  presence  on  the
             territory of that country or region, face a real risk of being
             subject to the serious threat referred in Article 15(c) of the
             Directive ..."

12. Importantly, however, the Court went on to note  that  the  concept  of
    such a generalised risk is  not  inconsistent  with  an  individualised
    assessment. It here introduced  what  has  come  to  be  known  as  the
    Elgafaji 'sliding scale' of harm:

         "39  In that regard, the more the applicant is able to show that he
             is specifically affected by reason of  factors  particular  to
             his  personal  circumstances,   the   lower   the   level   of
             indiscriminate violence required for him to  be  eligible  for
             subsidiary protection."

13. The most recent country guidance addressing the security  situation  in
    Kabul is AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan CG [2020] UKUT  00130  (IAC).
    In AS the Tribunal was asked to consider the evidence in the context of
    the reasonableness of internal flight to the city.  In its  review  the
    Tribunal inter alia concluded that the findings made by the Tribunal in
    AK (Article 15(c)) Afghanistan CG [2012]  UKUT  163  on  Article  15(c)
    should be maintained.  Both parties invited me to have regard to  those
    findings which can be summarised as follows:

      a)  There  is  not  a  general  risk  of  serious  harm  arising  from
         indiscriminate  violence  in  Kabul  albeit  that  there  is  today
         widespread and persistent conflict related violence there [headnote
         (ii) AS]

      b) A person with a support network or specific connections in Kabul is
         likely to be in a more advantageous position  on  return  [headnote
         (v) AS]

      c) The Elgafaji sliding scale nevertheless had to be  applied  to  the
         particular  circumstances  faced  by  an  individual  claimant.   A
         relevant factor could be membership of an "outright risk  category"
         as defined by UNHCR such as "members of minority  religious  groups
         and persons perceived as contravening Shari'a law" and "members  of
         minority ethnic groups" [paragraphs 86, 209 AK].

14. In respect of the weight to be attached to the UNHCR's  views  on  such
    matters, Mr Holmes relied upon  the  (unappealed)  observations  in  AS
    (safety of Kabul)  Afghanistan  CG  [2018]  UKUT  00118  that:  "it  is
    uncontroversial that significant weight can and should be  attached  to
    such evidence  from  the  UNHCR  as  the  Guidelines  on  International
    Protection  and  the  'Eligibility   Guidelines   for   Assessing   the
    International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Afghanistan"  [at
    �189].

15. Relying as he  did  on  the  Appellant's  minority  status,  Mr  Holmes
    accepted that also relevant to my enquiry would be the guidance of  the
    Tribunal on the position of Sikhs in Afghanistan. The  headnote  of  TG
    and others (Afghan Sikhs persecuted) Afghanistan CG [2015]  UKUT  00595
    (IAC) reads:

         "(i) Some members of the Sikh and Hindu communities in  Afghanistan
             continue to suffer harassment at the hands of Muslim zealots.

         ii) Members of the Sikh and Hindu communities  in  Afghanistan  do
             not face a real risk of persecution or ill-treatment  such  as
             to entitle them to a grant of international protection on  the
             basis of their ethnic or religious identity, per  se.  Neither
             can it be said that the cumulative  impact  of  discrimination
             suffered by the Sikh and Hindu communities in general  reaches
             the threshold of persecution.

        iii) A consideration of whether an individual member  of  the  Sikh
             and Hindu communities is at  risk  real  of  persecution  upon
             return to Afghanistan is  fact-sensitive.   All  the  relevant
             circumstances must be considered but careful attention  should
             be paid to the following:

               a. women  are  particularly  vulnerable  in  the  absence  of
                  appropriate protection from a male member of the family;

               b. likely financial circumstances and ability to access basic
                  accommodation bearing in mind:

                    - Muslims are generally unlikely to employ a member  of
                      the Sikh and Hindu communities

                    - such individuals  may  face  difficulties  (including
                      threats, extortion,  seizure  of  land  and  acts  of
                      violence) in retaining property  and  /  or  pursuing
                      their  remaining  traditional  pursuit,  that  of   a
                      shopkeeper / trader

                    -  the  traditional  source   of   support   for   such
                      individuals,  the  Gurdwara  is  much  less  able  to
                      provide adequate support;

               c.  the  level  of  religious  devotion  and  the   practical
                  accessibility to a suitable place of religious worship  in
                  light of declining numbers and the evidence that some have
                  been  subjected  to  harm  and  threats  to  harm   whilst
                  accessing the Gurdwara;

               d. access to appropriate education for children in  light  of
                  discrimination against Sikh and  Hindu  children  and  the
                  shortage of adequate education facilities for them.

         iv) Although it appears there is  a  willingness  at  governmental
             level to provide protection, it  is  not  established  on  the
             evidence that at a local level the police are willing, even if
             able, to provide the necessary level of protection required in
             Refugee Convention/Qualification  Directive  terms,  to  those
             members of the  Sikh  and  Hindu  communities  who  experience
             serious harm or harassment amounting to persecution.

          v) Whether it is reasonable to expect a member  of  the  Sikh  or
             Hindu communities to relocate is a fact sensitive  assessment.
             The relevant factors to be considered include those set out at
             (iii)  above.   Given  their  particular   circumstances   and
             declining number, the practicability of settling elsewhere for
             members of the Sikh and Hindu communities  must  be  carefully
             considered.  Those without access to an independent income are
             unlikely to be able to reasonably relocate because of depleted
             support mechanisms.

         vi) This replaces the county guidance provided in the cases  of  K
             (Risk - Sikh - Women) Afghanistan CG [2003] UKIAT 00057 and SL
             and Others (Returning Sikhs and Hindus) Afghanistan CG  [2005]
             UKAIT 00137."

16. Paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Rules provides that a claimant is to  be
    granted limited leave on human rights grounds where he can  demonstrate
    that he has:

         '(vi)    ... lived continuously in the UK for less  than  20  years
         (discounting any period of imprisonment) but there  would  be  very
         significant obstacles  to  the  applicant's  integration  into  the
         country to which he would have to go if required to leave the UK.'

17. The test of "very  significant  obstacles"  has  been  construed  as  a
    stringent one: Bossade (ss.117A-D-interrelationship with Rules)  [2015]
    UKUT 415 (IAC).  It will only be satisfied where there is a significant
    impediment to the claimant re-establishing a private life  for  himself
    in the country of return.  The  ambit  of  'private  life'  within  the
    meaning of  Article  8  is  broad,  and  famously  not  susceptible  to
    exhaustive definition.  In the context of this rule it could  encompass
    the right to work and earn  a  living,  accessing  education,  securing
    basic necessities, practising one's faith, and the right  to  meet  and
    form relationships with other human beings.

    The Facts

18. The Appellant is a 40 year-old woman. Her dependants are her  36  year-
    old husband and their three children who are today a girl  aged  13,  a
    girl aged 8 and a boy aged 5.

19. The agreed facts are that the Appellant and her family  are  practising
    Sikhs who although originally from Khost,  were  formerly  resident  in
    Kabul.   They left Afghanistan in 2004 and travelled  to  Russia  where
    the Appellant's husband ran a small business.  The  children  were  all
    born in Russia.   The family returned to  Afghanistan  in  2016  before
    leaving again, this time for the United Kingdom. The Appellant  suffers
    from Thalassaemia and anxiety.  There is no evidence of any illness  in
    any other member of the family.

20. A number of findings of fact have been made against the  Appellant  and
    her family, first by First-tier Tribunal Judge Smith, and then by First-
    tier Tribunal Herwald  in  his  decision  of  28th  March  2019.  These
    include:

      a) A rejection of the claim that they fled Afghanistan, in either 2004
         or 2016, as a result of persecution;

      b) A finding  that  the  family  funded  the  $35,000  cost  of  their
         migration to the United Kingdom from an "independent income" and so
         could do so again;

      c) Prior to the family's arrival in the United  Kingdom  none  of  the
         children received an education in either Russia  or  Afghanistan  -
         leading to the inference that the adult Appellants' expressed fears
         of their daughter not being able to attend school are disingenuous.

21. At the date of the hearing before me the family had been living in  the
    United Kingdom since August 2016.

    Country Background Information

22. I have had regard to the  findings  in  TG  and  others  (Afghan  Sikhs
    persecuted) Afghanistan CG [2015] UKUT 00595 (IAC), AK (Article  15(c))
    Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 163 and AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan  CG
    [2020] UKUT 00130 (IAC).

23. At the hearing in February I admitted an additional bundle of  evidence
    adduced on behalf of the Appellant. This included an updated report  by
    Dr Magnus Marsden and a series of recent  news  reports.   I  refer  to
    these documents, where  appropriate,  in  my  discussion  and  findings
    below.

    Discussion and Findings

24. In accordance with the guidance in Elgafaji my starting point  must  be
    to determine the nature of the general risk prevailing in Kabul.   Only
    then can  I  assess  whether  the  particular  characteristics  of  the
    Appellant mean that she will be specifically affected, so that a  lower
    level of indiscriminate violence will be required  in  order  that  she
    qualify for protection.

25. By its decision in AS, the Tribunal has maintained the country guidance
    in AK.  Although neither Tribunal was satisfied that levels of violence
    had reached the threshold where any civilian was  at  risk,  they  both
    make for sobering reading. The concern expressed at paragraph 248 of AK
    has been shown to be well-founded.  In  2012  the  Tribunal  could  not
    overlook the fact that NATO was leaving, or that "the  current  overall
    trend is one of rising levels of violence now over several  years";  in
    2020 the Tribunal accepted the evidence  that  civilian  casualties  in
    Afghanistan are now at record levels, with the Taliban and other groups
    such as  Islamic  State  rushing  to  fill  the  void  left  behind  by
    withdrawing NATO troops.   UNAMA have documented  a  42%  rise  in  the
    number of civilian casualties between July and September 2019, compared
    to the same period in 2018.  At the date of their report  of  the  17th
    October 2019 they had recorded 8,239 civilian casualties for the  year.
    It  was  evidence  like  this  which  caused  the  Tribunal  in  AS  to
    acknowledge that the situation had  deteriorated  in  the  years  since
    2012.

26. The Tribunal in AS concluded that the chances of an economically active
    resident (that is to say an individual who needs to leave  the  home  -
    there a male Muslim)  being  subject  to  indiscriminate  violence  was
    "low". Faced with  competing  submissions  about  how  low,  the  panel
    accepted that chances were 1 in a 1000. At �201:

         "Kabul (both the city and province) is  significantly  affected  by
         widespread and longstanding conflict-related violence and has  been
         - at a relatively consistent level - since at least 2016.  Some  of
         the violence is targeted  (e.g.  at  police,  embassies  or  ethnic
         groups) but  much  of  it  is  indiscriminate.  Even  the  targeted
         violence affects civilians in an indiscriminate way, because people
         can be killed or injured as bystanders. There is also a significant
         problem of violent crime".

27. The position of minorities  was  not  specifically  considered  by  the
    Tribunal in AS, but the panel did endorse the reasoning in AK.  In this
    regard Mr Holmes relied in particular on paragraph �209 of AK:

         "209. We agree with Mr Vokes and Ms Rutherford that  the  "sliding-
         scale" element of Article 15(c) as set out by the Court of  Justice
         in Elgafaji in para 39 would appear to make it possible for  anyone
         with a relevant individual characteristics to be  able  to  show  a
         real risk under  Article  15(c)  even  if  the  relevant  level  of
         violence was not at a high  enough  level  for  such  a  person  to
         qualify merely as a  civilian.  The  Court  does  not  confine  its
         description to civilians whose relevant  risk  characteristics  are
         such as to make them at risk of serious harm under 15(a) or (b) (or
         indeed Article 1A(2) of the Refugee Convention or Article 3 of  the
         ECHR). In principle, therefore, there is scope for Article  15(c)'s
         "sliding-scale" to protect not only recognised risk categories such
         as  those  set  out  (non-exhaustively)  by  UNHCR  in   its   2010
         Eligibility Guidelines (i)-(xi), but also  intermediate  categories
         who do not come within the former's scope..."

28. Those Guidelines were set out at AK's �86:

         "86. Reference has already  been  made  to  the  UNHCR  Eligibility
         Guidelines for Assessing  the  International  Protection  Needs  of
         Asylum Seekers from Afghanistan, 17 December  2010.   They  include
         references  to  a  considerable  body  of  empirical   data   about
         conditions in Afghanistan, as well as UNHCR's evaluation of  it  in
         the form of guidelines. The Guidelines identify two types  of  risk
         category. The first concerns persons with a specific risk profile:

             "UNHCR considers that individuals with the  profiles  outlined
             below require a particularly careful examination  of  possible
             risks. These risk profiles, while not necessarily  exhaustive,
             include [NB. For convenience we start each  subcategory  on  a
             separate line:]

               i) individuals associated with, or  perceived  as  supportive
                  of, the Afghan Government and the international community,
                  including  the  International  Security  Assistance  Force
                  (ISAF);

              ii) humanitarian workers and human rights activists;

             iii) journalists and other media professionals;

              iv) civilians suspected of  supporting  armed  anti-Government
                  groups;

               v) members of minority religious groups and persons perceived
                  as contravening Shari'a law;

              vi) women with specific profiles;

             vii) children with specific profiles;

            viii) victims of trafficking;

              ix) lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and  intersex  (LGBTI)
                  individuals;

               x) members of (minority) ethnic groups; and

              xi) persons at risk of becoming victims of blood feuds."

29. So there is scope for the Article 15(c) 'sliding scale' to  be  applied
    so as to offer protection to members of minority faiths.  Whether  this
    family - this Appellant - should be offered  such  protection  must  be
    evaluated in light of the particular evidence on Sikhs.

30. In TG & Ors (Afghan Sikhs persecuted) the Tribunal were  not  satisfied
    that there was in 2015 a real risk of  serious  harm  per  se.  It  did
    however accept that Sikhs  had  faced  persecution  under  the  Taliban
    regime, and that the community continued face systematic discrimination
    in Afghanistan [at �78]:

         "It is not disputed before us that historically members of the Sikh
         and Hindu community in Afghanistan have been subjected to what  may
         be perceived as acts of persecution by  both  state  and  non-state
         actors. The material we have been asked  to  consider  demonstrates
         that the number of such incidents has reduced (but  this  might  be
         explained by the reduction in the Sikh and  Hindu  population)  and
         there is currently little material to support a claim  of  official
         state sponsored persecution.  The material does support  a  finding
         that there is ongoing harassment of and discrimination against some
         members of the Sikh and Hindu community in Afghanistan, as set  out
         above, but the evidence includes very few examples of  recent  acts
         of harm or threats of harm  sufficient  to  satisfy  the  necessary
         test.  We bear in mind Dr Giustozzi's point that this  is  an  area
         that has not been prioritised by the media for reporting  but  when
         we consider all the material available to us, we find  it  of  note
         that there is little to suggest that  there  have  been  continuing
         recent  incidents  of  harm  toward  Sikhs/Hindus.    Although   Dr
         Giustozzi has described a picture of 'intensive harassment' at page
         12 of his report, he has not supported this by drawing attention to
         specific  examples  of  individuals  being   repeatedly   harassed.
         Expropriation has been said to have almost stopped because the most
         valuable properties  have  already  been  taken  away.   Under  the
         heading 'post-2005 violence and harassment' Dr Giustozzi focuses on
         examples of violence up to 2010 and references to more recent years
         are vague and generalised.  This is notwithstanding the  fact  that
         Dr Giustozzi's researcher carried out three interviews in  December
         2013-January 2014 with senior members of Sikh and Hindu communities
         ..."

31. It then makes the following observation:

         "We accept  that  whilst  the  subject  group  diminishes  in  size
         opportunities to inflict harm may also decrease and note  that  the
         small number of Sikhs and Hindus who  remain  in  Afghanistan  have
         been reported to be even more vulnerable to abuse (see UNHCR report
         2013), but the lack  of  evidence  of  such  ongoing  issues  is  a
         relevant consideration. Perhaps the best evidence in support of the
         existence of a current  real  risk  from  the  perspective  of  the
         appellants is to be found in the Respondents OGN of 2013  which  we
         set out above."

32. Mr Holmes submitted that that this was an important point. In the 1980s
    there were  believed  to  be  in  excess  of  50,000  Sikhs  living  in
    Afghanistan. At the date of  the  appeal  in  TG  that  population  had
    diminished to the extent that the community in Kabul numbered  no  more
    than 3000  individuals.   That  meant  that  whilst  the  incidence  of
    reported hostility towards the community dropped,   it was  nonetheless
    rendered more vulnerable. That this is so is expressly accepted at  �83
    of TG: "we note the decline in  actual  numbers  of  members  of  these
    religious groups remaining in Afghanistan although we  also  appreciate
    this may increase their vulnerability".    The  report  of  Dr  Marsden
    before me details a visit that he made to Kabul in 2018. He found  that
    there were at that time still approximately 150 Sikh or Hindu  families
    living in Kabul: this roughly accords with the estimate of 1000  people
    given in the Respondent's CPIN  today.    There  has  accordingly  been
    since 2015 a reduction of approximately two  thirds  of  the  remaining
    population.  It should also be noted that according to Dr Marsden, many
    of those families are Sikhs who have internally relocated to Kabul from
    other parts of Afghanistan, so in fact the indigenous Sikh community of
    the city is even smaller than that.

33. As to the circumstances faced by that small population, I was  referred
    to the evidence in the Appellant's bundle.

34. In TG the Tribunal had heard that  the  once  prosperous  community  in
    Kabul -  historically  engaged  in  trade  and  commerce  -  had  faced
    significant losses in the preceding twenty years.   Under  the  Taliban
    the community gradually lost trading partners, through either hostility
    or fear, so that by the time that  that  country  guidance  was  given,
    their losses ironically underpinned  the  Tribunal's  conclusions  that
    they were no longer at risk per se: they could no longer be subject  to
    land seizures or extortion because there was nothing left to rob.    In
    his 2018 visit Dr Marsden found that  most  of  the  men  in  the  Sikh
    community were today engaged in low-return  small  businesses,  in  the
    main selling herbal remedies, or 'Greek  medicine'.   These  businesses
    employ only individual men, and bring in just about subsistence  levels
    of  income.   I  pause  here  to  note  that  this  country  background
    information - unchallenged by the Respondent - is somewhat difficult to
    square with the First-tier Tribunal's  conclusion  in  this  case  that
    having spent $35,000 on getting here, this family would be returning to
    an "independent income" and  comparable  levels  of  prosperity.   That
    conclusion is simply not consistent with the  objective  evidence  that
    this is a community that  has  been  economically  devastated.    I  am
    nevertheless bound by Judge Herwald's finding that it  is  likely  that
    the Appellant still has family left  in  Kabul,  and  in  light  of  Dr
    Marsden's evidence that the community accommodate their own - either in
    private homes on in the Gurdwaras themselves  -  I  am  satisfied  that
    there would be a roof over their  heads  and  basic  financial  support
    extended to them should they return.  Another preserved finding is that
    the Appellant's husband, a resourceful businessman,  could,  in  common
    with his co-religionists in Kabul, support the  family  by  starting  a
    small business.

35. It is however  in  respect  of  security  and  safety  that  Mr  Holmes
    concentrated his submissions.

36. Dr Marsden reports that there have been a number of significant attacks
    on the community in recent years. The largest occurred on the 1st  July
    2018 when 17 senior  members  of  the  community  were  murdered  in  a
    targeted attack by a Daesh suicide bomber.  The delegation had been  on
    their way from Kabul to Jalalabad to meet with President  Ashraf  Ghani
    to discuss inter alia the security concerns of the community.  The  May
    2019 CPIN Afghanistan: Sikhs  and  Hindus  reports  that  although  the
    attack was widely condemned  at  government  level  the  crime  remains
    unsolved.  Dr Marsden records  subsequent  incidents  of  a  shopkeeper
    being shot in Herat, and the gruesome murder of a  young  herbalist  in
    Kabul, apparently abducted on his way home and never seen alive  again.
    The community reported to Dr Marsden that as well as dealing  with  the
    heartbreak of this boy's death, they also had to deal with  the  trauma
    of the authorities' actions following  their  discovery  of  his  body.
    Although  mutilated  by  torture  (possibly  with  acid),  Sikh  elders
    maintain that he was identifiable as a Sikh by the khalsa on his  wrist
    and his long  hair.  The  police  nevertheless  failed  to  inform  the
    community that the boy's body had been found, and instead buried him in
    an unmarked grave in the Muslim cemetery.   It was  only  recovered  by
    the community for Sikh funeral rites some two months later.

37. These murders - significant as they are for such a small  population  -
    are extreme but not the only incidents  of  violence  recorded  in  the
    evidence before me. A report prepared by the World Sikh Organisation of
    Canada, based on  cited  reports  from  reputable  news  organisations,
    entitled the Plight of Afghan  Sikhs  and  Hindus  (hereinafter  'WSO')
    makes  reference  to  other,  more  regular  pressures  placed  on  the
    community. Four features of daily life are identified, which I consider
    in turn below: as these issues also feature in the May 2019 CPIN I have
    included relevant references to that.

38. The first is that Sikhs face physical and  verbal  assault  by  hostile
    members of the public. As well as actual attacks  this  everyday  abuse
    can include taunting and name calling, turbans being  pulled  from  the
    head, being spat at, windows being smashed, homes being graffitied,  or
    stones and rubbish being thrown [see for instance CPIN  6.2.3].     The
    CPIN [at 6.2.1]  notes  the  conclusions  expressed  by  the  US  State
    Department that the community are particularly vulnerable to this  kind
    of harassment and attack  because  the  distinctive  headdress  of  the
    turban renders them highly visible.  This hostility can range from  the
    loudspeakers of a Mosque being 'aimed' at Sikh  homes  as  intimidation
    [CPIN 6.2.2] to a man being knocked from his motorbike  in  a  targeted
    incident in September 2018 [CPIN 6.2.3] and people being beaten up  and
    robbed in the street [WSO at page 85].

39.  Second,  although  the  Sikh  community  in  Kabul  enjoys  very  warm
    relationships with many of their Muslim neighbours  [see  for  instance
    CPIN  at  6.1.1]  there  is  a  constant  pressure  to  convert.   Some
    commentators attribute this to extremist  elements  from  elsewhere  in
    Afghanistan having moved into the capital [2.3.8]. This pressure can be
    applied simply by abuse in the street (see above) but there  have  also
    been examples of abductions  and  assaults  in  which  it  has  been  a
    feature. One example in the WSO report is  of  a  shopkeeper  in  Kabul
    being threatened by a man who in June 2016 held him at  knifepoint  and
    ordered him to renounce his faith.  The CPIN documents young  Sikh  men
    disguising themselves in public in order to avoid such pressure [6.1.3]
    or coming under pressure to fast during Ramadhan [6.2.1].

40. Third, there is a tension  between  their  position  as  an  officially
    recognised minority, ostensibly under  the  protection  of  the  Afghan
    government, and the complete failure of the state to offer any kind  of
    restitution for the crimes that have  already  been  committed  against
    them.  As the Tribunal heard in TG, the Sikh community in Kabul have in
    the past twenty years lost significant amounts of valuable land in  the
    city centre to illegal and often violent 'land grabs'.  To  date  there
    has been no legal action to return the land  to  its  rightful  owners.
    Today they live in overcrowded and cramped quarters right next  to  the
    land that they know is  legally  theirs.  The  new  'owners'  of  these
    properties are often powerful individuals  and  so  there  is  for  the
    alienated Sikh a constant fear that they will be targeted by these  men
    in pre-emptive strikes to protect the seized assets.

41. Fourth, the rise of Daesh in the last few years as given rise to a  new
    threat: pressure to pay the jizya,  a  heavy  'protection  tax'  levied
    against non-Muslims. Under the Taliban the community had been forced to
    pay this money  to  survive  and  today  this  barely  veiled  form  of
    extortion has made a comeback.   There have  been  several  reports  of
    Daesh proclamations - and some members of the community in  Kabul  have
    received direct demands for payment - accompanied by threats  of  death
    if the 'tax' is not paid. Against the background of the suicide  attack
    in Kandahar these threats are taken extremely  seriously  [CPIN  6.2.4-
    6.2.5].

42. As to whether the community can reasonably be expected to look  to  the
    Afghan state for protection against these  harms  I  am  bound  by  the
    findings of the Tribunal in TG that it cannot:

         "90  In relation to Sikh or Hindu  individuals  who  do  experience
             persecution  or  harassment  and  discrimination  capable   of
             crossing the threshold  into  serious  harm  (based  upon  the
             Horvath/Hathaway approach that persecution =  serious  harm  +
             ineffective protection), whilst there may be a willingness  at
             governmental level to provide protection we  do  not  find  it
             established on the evidence that at a local level  members  of
             the Afghan police are willing, even if able, to  provide  them
             such   protection   to   the   level   required   in   Refugee
             Convention/Qualification Directive terms.  There  is  evidence
             in the materials provided [Appendix A. Items  10  and  33]  of
             police  corruption.   We  accept  the  evidence  that  it   is
             reasonably likely that complaints made directly to the  police
             of harassment by members of the Sikh and Hindu community  have
             been ignored.  In the event of intervention that has  occurred
             this has mainly been as a result  of  a  specific  instruction
             that they do so issued at the highest level.   There  is  also
             evidence that some of those involved in  'Mafia  style'  gangs
             responsible for land seizures and exploitation of  members  of
             these groups, based upon a perception  of  wealth,  have  been
             members of the police or security forces past or  present  who
             specifically target members of the Sikh and Hindu  communities
             as a result of the fact that they are perceived  as  religious
             minorities with little or  no  means  to  respond  to  protect
             themselves. It has not been shown that representations made by
             members of the community holding posts in  the  administration
             have  secured  adequate  protection,  the   common   complaint
             recorded  in  the  evidence  is  that  notwithstanding   these
             concerns being brought to the attention of those in authority,
             very little is done to remedy the situation in practice."

    For the  sake  of  completeness  I  note  that  these  findings  remain
    uncontested by the Respondent [see CPIN 2.4.4].

43. I have borne in mind Mr Bates' reliance on the conclusions in  AS  that
    overall the level of violence in Kabul is - in terms of Article 15(c) -
    "low", but I am satisfied, having  regard  to  the  country  background
    information before me which post-dates TG, that for the Sikh  community
    the level of violence is considerably higher.   For the ordinary Kabuli
    the risk of indiscriminate violence can, as the Tribunal in  AS  found,
    be mitigated by avoiding obvious targets such as  government  buildings
    or crowded places such as markets.  For  the  Sikh  community  no  such
    option exists since they are a target.  I do not doubt that many native
    Muslim Kabulis are warm and supportive of their  neighbours.  The  CPIN
    [at 6.1.1] alludes to such  relationships  and  the  support  that  the
    ancient Sikh and Hindu  communities  derive  from  them.  The  city  is
    however much changed. Four decades of war and ongoing  instability  has
    left  people  withdrawn  and  afraid,  and  the  solidarity   felt   in
    neighbourhoods where once everybody knew each other fractured.

44. In this environment, Sikhs are unable to leave the  house  feeling  any
    kind of security. As the Tribunal noted in ZMM (Article 15(c)) Libya CG
    [2017] UKUT 00263 (IAC) [at �81] the harm covered by Article  15(c)  is
    not  limited  to  death  or  physical  injury:    the   mental   health
    consequences of living under that kind of stress  is  also  a  relevant
    metric.   There considering the impact on Libyans of living under heavy
    shell bombardment the Tribunal found  that  it  did  not  need  to  see
    specific medical evidence relating  to  the  individuals  concerned  to
    accept that living in fear  can  have  a  serious  impact  upon  mental
    wellbeing.  Here I accept that the same  must  be  said  of  this  tiny
    community, subject as it is to attacks ranging from  suicide  bombs  to
    daily taunting.  Even in the context of Afghanistan's miserable  recent
    history, the challenges faced by the Sikh community  are  overwhelming.
    As one Hazara man cited in the May 2019 CPIN [at 6.2.5] put it: "to  be
    a member of a minority in Afghanistan is hell; but to be a  Sikh  means
    being in the innermost circle of hell".

45. Having taken all of the submissions and  evidence  into  account  I  am
    satisfied that in light of the size of  the  Sikh  population  left  in
    Afghanistan the figures of violence are such that applying the Elgafaji
    'sliding scale' there are substantial grounds for believing that a Sikh
    civilian returned to  Afghanistan  would,  solely  on  account  of  his
    presence there face a real risk of being subject to the serious  threat
    within the meaning of Article 15(c) of the  Directive.  The  appeal  is
    allowed on that basis.

46. It follows that applying the same factual matrix I  am  satisfied  that
    the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Rules is made out. I
    make clear that in this alternative finding I have  based  my  decision
    solely on the preceding matters and have  not  found  it  necessary  to
    consider the additional submissions made by Mr Holmes,  and  indeed  Mr
    Bates, in respect of the relevance of education for  the  children,  or
    the  additional  challenges  faced  by  a  Sikh  woman  living   in   a
    conservative Islamic society.

    Decisions

47. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is  set  aside  to  the  extent
    identified above.

48. The Tribunal erred  in  omitting  to  consider  Article  15(c)  of  the
    Qualification Directive and 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules.  In
    respect of those matters  I  remake  the  decision  in  the  appeal  as
    follows:

         "The appeal is allowed on protection grounds.

         The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds."

49. Having regard to the fact that this is a protection claim  I  make  the
    following direction for anonymity, pursuant to Rule 14 of the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  and  the  Presidential  Guidance
    Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders.

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her
         family.  This direction applies both to the Appellants and  to  the
         Respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction  could  lead  to
         contempt of court proceedings".
