For the Appellant:     Ms Nnamani, Counsel instructed by Samuel Louis
                    Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Gregor Jack, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who was born  on  the  9th  January
   1973. He appeals, with permission, against the decision of the First-tier
   Tribunal (Judge Malins) to dismiss his  appeal  against  refusal  of  his
   application for an EEA Residence Card as confirmation  of  his  right  to
   reside in the United Kingdom as the spouse of an EEA national  exercising
   her European Community Treaty rights in the United Kingdom.


2. The issue in the appeal was whether the appellant's marriage to  his  EEA
   sponsor was one of convenience. The First-tier  Tribunal  found  that  it
   was. It is therefore somewhat strange that permission  to  appeal  should
   have been granted on the ground that "the judge took no note  of  Article
   8". Having found that the marriage was a sham, it would  seem  to  follow
   that there would not have been  any  family  life  that  was  capable  of
   engaging the potential operation  of  Article  8  of  the  1950  European
   Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and  Fundamental  Freedoms.
   However, the grounds of appeal also argue that the reasons given for  the
   Tribunal's finding were unsustainable on  the  evidence.  Permission  was
   also granted to argue "all other  points  raised  by  the  Appellant".  I
   therefore begin by considering these "other points".


3. The appellant's case was that he met his now wife, a  Greek  national  by
   the name of 'Monique Papenhagen', at Stratford Shopping  Centre,  London,
   in April 2012. Their relationship thereafter blossomed and they  married,
   at Newham Registry Office, on the 5th  January  2013.  Ms  Papenhagen  is
   currently employed by 'Tedmoses Consult Limited' for which  she  is  paid
   around ï¿½910 a month, net of statutory deductions.


4. The respondent's  reason  for  refusing  the  application  was  that  the
   appellant's unexplained failure to attend with his wife for an  interview
   with the Secretary of State's official  was  one  that  gave  rise  to  a
   reasonable suspicion of  the  marriage  being  a  sham.  The  appellant's
   explanation  at  the  hearing  for  his  non-attendance  was   that   his
   representative had failed to inform him of the interview,  and  that  the
   representative had excused his failure on the ground that he had lost the
   appellant's telephone number.


5. Under the heading, "Credibility", the judge found  that  Ms  Papenhagen's
   evidence was "inconsistent with the usual concept of marriage". Her brief
   written statement was  "curt  and  cold",  and  she  had  not  taken  the
   opportunity to expand upon it  during  her  evidence-in-chief  [paragraph
   8(a)]. The evidence that only one friend had attended the  wedding,  that
   the reception had taken place in a public house, that the  appellant  had
   not bought Ms  Papenhagen  an  engagement  ring,  that  the  proposal  of
   marriage had taken place in a branch of McDonald's restaurant, that  they
   had first met in a shopping centre, and that the appellant had not got to
   know his wife's flatmates during the period of their courtship, were  all
   factors which  the  judge  regarded  as  being  either  "implausible"  or
   "inconsistent with the usual concept of a wedding" [paragraph  8(b)-(e)].
   The judge also noted an inconsistency between the evidence  of  appellant
   and his wife as to who first made the  proposal  of  marriage  [paragraph
   8(c)] and found that the appellant's explanation for  his  non-attendance
   at the Home Office interview was implausible [paragraph 8(f)].


6. Under the heading, "My Findings  of  Fact",  the  judge  noted  that  the
   application had been made very shortly after the marriage had taken place
   and very shortly before the  appellant's  leave  to  remain  was  due  to
   expire, that the appellant's work as a security  guard  was  far  removed
   from that for which he had been granted leave to  remain  in  the  United
   Kingdom,  that  the  appellant  had  previously  made  two   unsuccessful
   applications for leave to remain (something which the judge suggested was
   a sign of his desperation to remain in the United  Kingdom),  that  there
   was no evidence of the appellant's academic achievements (from which  the
   judge concluded that he was not a "genuine  student"),  that  there  were
   anomalies in the evidence concerning the sponsor's occupation,  that  the
   only documentary evidence of cohabitation was  a  bank  statement  and  a
   television licence  addressed  to  the  sponsor  (the  judge  noting,  in
   particular, that there was no evidence of a joint tenancy agreement), and
   that the appellant was still giving his "bachelor address" when  he  made
   his application [paragraph 9(a)-(j)].


7. Some of Ms Nnamani's complaints  concerning  the  judge's  reasoning  are
   clearly well founded. Thus, in the course of noting the anomalies in  the
   documentary evidence  concerning  the  sponsor's  occupation,  the  judge
   wrongly   observed   that   her   post-decision   payslips    constituted
   "inadmissible" evidence. That statement  was  legally  incorrect  because
   this was an in-country  appeal.  However,  this  was  immaterial  to  the
   outcome of the appeal because the claim that the sponsor  was  exercising
   her Community Treaty rights in the United Kingdom had not been placed  in
   issue by the respondent, and neither was it  ultimately  the  basis  upon
   which the Tribunal dismissed the appeal.


8. Ms  Nnamani  also  argued  that  the  lack  of  evidence  concerning  the
   appellant's academic achievements could not provide a basis for a finding
   that the appellant had not been a "genuine student". I agree. The absence
   of proof of academic achievement did not constitute proof of its absence,
   especially in circumstances where this was not  the  core  issue  in  the
   appeal.


9. I also agree that many of the  judge's  findings  of  implausibility  are
   problematic. For example, her finding that the  appellant's  account  was
   inconsistent with "the usual concept" of courtship and marriage  was  one
   that was based entirely upon her own subjective view of  the  matters  in
   question. Judges are generally well-advised to avoid making findings that
   are based upon their own necessarily limited experience of the  lifestyle
   and culture of others.


10. I do not  however  agree  with  the  submission  that  the  findings  in
   paragraph 9 of the determination were entirely irrelevant to the issue of
   whether the appellant had entered into a sham marriage. The  distribution
   of the judge's findings between paragraphs 8 and 9 of  her  determination
   is  undoubtedly  curious,  but  may  have  been  intended  to  reflect  a
   distinction between those  that  directly  impinged  upon  the  issue  of
   whether the marriage was one of convenience and those that related to the
   general credibility of the witnesses who had given evidence in support of
   the appellant's case that it was not. Moreover, whilst the  reference  in
   paragraph 8(a) to "evidence which is inconsistent with the usual  concept
   of marriage" is unfortunate, the substance of that paragraph can be  read
   as saying no more than that the  sponsor's  apparent  lack  of  love  and
   devotion was a factor that did not assist the appellant in  proving  that
   he had entered into a genuine marriage.


11. The question that I have to decide, therefore, is whether the  undoubted
   flaws in  some  aspects  of  the  judge's  reasoning  are  sufficient  to
   undermine the safety of the decision as a whole. I  have  concluded  that
   they are not. Upon reading the determination as a whole, I  am  satisfied
   that sufficient and  sustainable  reasons  were  given  for  the  judge's
   overall conclusion that the appellant had failed to discharge the  burden
   of proving that he had entered into a marriage which was not a sham.


12. For the reasons that I have already given,  I  am  also  satisfied  that
   consideration of Article 8  of  the  1950  European  Convention  for  the
   Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms could have led  to  a
   different outcome in the determination of the appeal. Further, and in the
   alternative,  a  decision  to  refuse  to  issue  a  Residence  Card   as
   confirmation of a right of residence under  European  Community  Treaties
   could not of itself have led to the appellant's removal from  the  United
   Kingdom, and thus to the potential engagement of the operation of Article
   8. This was specifically drawn to the appellant's attention by the  terms
   of the Notice of Decision.
