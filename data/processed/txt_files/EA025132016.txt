                            MR OLABINJO OGUNNOWO
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria.  He seeks to  appeal  against  a
    decision dated 11th February  2016  to  refuse  to  grant  him  an  EEA
    residence card.

2.   On 19th September 2016 an  Upper  Tribunal  decision  was  promulgated,
    namely Sala (EFMs: Right of Appeal)  [2016]  UKUT  00411  (IAC).   That
    indicated that there was no  statutory  right  of  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of State not to grant a residence card  to  a
    person claiming to be an extended family member.

3.   Thus it was that the First-tier Tribunal, in a decision promulgated  on
    15th June 2017 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Saffer, indicated  that  it
    had no jurisdiction to entertain that matter.

4.   It also indicated that, in the light of  Amirteymour  and  Others  (EFA
    appeals: human rights) [2015] UKUT 00466,  an appeal in respect of  the
    refusal to grant a residence card did not  encompass  without  more  an
    appeal in respect of human rights.  That required a distinct appeal  in
    the proper form.

5.   The decision in Khan v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ  1755  indicated  that  the
    decision in Sala was incorrect and that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did
    indeed  have  jurisdiction  to  entertain  the  appeal.    Accordingly,
    permission to challenge  that  decision  was  granted  and  the  matter
    initially listed in the Upper Tribunal to challenge the  decision.   It
    seems  to  me  that  that   a  hearing  is  unnecessary  in   all   the
    circumstances.

6.   It is clearly  a  matter  in  which  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal should be set aside so that the substantive appeal in relation
    to an EEA residence card can be considered by the First-tier  Tribunal.



7.   Thus the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge is set aside and  is
    to be re-made in the light of Khan.

8.   Costs reserved.

No anonymity direction is made
