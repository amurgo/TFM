                            Vijayakumar Seenirasa
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent

                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka born 30 July 1962.  He  appealed
    to the First-tier Tribunal against a decision of the Secretary of  State
    of 23 May 2014, refusing to vary his leave to  remain  in  the  UK.  The
    First-tier Tribunal dismissed this appeal in a determination promulgated
    on 24 February 2015. Permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  was
    granted by a First tier judge and the appeal is  pending  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 2. By way of a  letter  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  dated  4  June  2015  the
    appellant's  representatives  say  that  he  wishes  to   withdraw   the
    application.

 3. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party  to  withdraw  its
    case, and I give such consent.

 4. Accordingly with my consent, and pursuant to rule 17(5) of the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  this  appeal  is  recorded  as
    "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal".  This  is  a  Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform the parties that the  appellant's  case
    is withdrawn.

 5. The effect of the  appellant's  case  being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper  Tribunal  are  at  an
    end. There is no appeal before the Upper  Tribunal  and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision shall stand.

Upper Tribunal Judge Taylor
