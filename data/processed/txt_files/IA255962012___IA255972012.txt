Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr H Makkar, of Malik & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms S Kiss, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellants are nationals of India, born  respectively  in  November
    1980 and November 1987.  They are a  student  wife  and  her  dependent
    husband.  They appealed to a Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  against
    the decision of the Secretary of State of 29 October 2012  refusing  to
    vary leave to enter the United Kingdom.

2.   The first appellant entered the United Kingdom on 23 January 2011 as  a
    student with her husband as her dependant.   Their  leave  was  due  to
    expire on 31 May 2012, but on 30 May they applied for further leave  to
    remain.  The application was refused on 29 May 2012.

3.   The judge noted documentation submitted in support of the  application.
     In essence the appellant sought to rely on financial support from  her
    husband's mother, Kulwant Kaur, who had undertaken to finance fully the
    first appellant's further studies in the United Kingdom.  She swore  an
    affidavit on 21 May 2012 and provided a bank statement dated  10  April
    2012 showing a sum which was found by the judge at paragraph 15 of  the
    determination to amount to the equivalent of approximately ï¿½2,500,  the
    sum required as maintenance.

4.   The judge held that the respondent had rightly relied on  paragraph  13
    of Appendix C to HC 395 on the basis that the appellant was seeking  to
    rely on the Rules prior to their amendment, and in any event there  was
    no evidence that the funds had ever in fact  become  available  to  the
    appellants.   The  appeals  were  accordingly   dismissed   under   the
    Immigration Rules and Article 8 of the  European  Convention  on  Human
    Rights, though as  the  judge  noted,  the  decision  to  make  removal
    directions under Section 47 of the 2006 Act was unlawful  as  concluded
    by the Upper Tribunal in Adamally and Jaferi [2012] UKUT 00414 (IAC).

5.   The appellants sought permission to appeal, and permission was  granted
    by a Judge of the First-tier Tribunal, who noted that  the  application
    fell to be considered by reference to paragraph (ba) of Appendix  E  of
    the Immigration Rules, in respect of which it  was  arguable  that  the
    funds being made  available  by  the  second  appellant's  mother  were
    available to him and by reason of his marriage to his  wife  the  first
    appellant.

6.   In his submissions Mr Makkar relied on his skeleton argument  and  also
    the decision of the Upper Tribunal in Ejifugha [2011] UKUT 00244 (IAC).
     He also put in an archived copy of the relevant Immigration Rules.  He
    relied on the grant of permission.  Funds had been  made  available  by
    the first appellant's mother-in-law.  The meaning  of  "available"  had
    been considered by the Upper Tribunal in Ejifugha at paragraphs 14,  15
    and 18 in particular.  The Rule had subsequently been amended in  light
    of Upper Tribunal decisions to require the funds to be "held",  however
    it was common ground that the availability test was the relevant one at
    the date in question in this case.
7.   Ms Kiss argued that Ejifugha involved an  appellant's  husband  whereas
    there was only one applicant in this case and a dependant.  The account
    in question belonged to her husband's mother and not  to  her  husband.
    She argued, with reference to a decision of the Tribunal in  KP  [2006]
    UKAIT 00093 and by analogy to the situation there that a  mother-in-law
    did not come within the wording of the Rule.

8.   I explored with the representatives the relevant provisions.   Appendix
    C to HC 395 is headed Maintenance (Funds) and sets out requirements  in
    cases where an applicant is required to obtain points under Appendix C.
     Appendix E is concerned with Maintenance (Funds)  for  the  family  of
    relevant points-based system migrants.  It is clear from paragraph (aa)
    of Appendix E that paragraphs 1A and 1B of Appendix C apply to Appendix
    E, but they were only added as from 20 July 2012, which  is  after  the
    date of application in this case.

9.   It is clear from paragraph 13 of Appendix  C  that,  for  funds  to  be
    available, they must be held by the applicant, his or her parent(s)  or
    legal guardian(s) or an official financial sponsor.  Under Appendix  E,
    paragraph (f) makes it clear that where the applicant  is  applying  as
    the partner of a relevant Points Based System Migrant, the  funds  must
    be available to him or to that migrant.  It is  clear  that  the  first
    appellant cannot succeed under Appendix C, as her circumstances do  not
    fall within the definition of applicability set out  at  paragraph  13.
    That definition is not carried over to Appendix E in this case  because
    it was added after the date  of  application.   But  paragraph  (e)  of
    Appendix E states that where  the  relevant  Points  Based  Migrant  is
    applying for entry clearance or leave to remain at the same time as the
    applicant, the amount of funds available to the applicant  must  be  in
    addition to the level of funds required separately of the migrant.

10.   The  judge  was  satisfied  that  the  sums  offered  by  the   second
    appellant's mother were sufficient to meet the maintenance requirements
    of the first appellant, but there is no indication that any  offer  was
    made to enable adequate maintenance of the second appellant.

11.  Hence the judge was right to  dismiss  the  appeal  and,  for  somewhat
    different reasons, his decision is maintained.
