                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. On  19  February  2015  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  to  vary  the
   claimant's leave to remain as a spouse and decided to remove her from the
   United Kingdom (UK)  by  way  of  directions  under  section  47  of  the
   Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. The  claimant  appealed  to
   the First-tier Tribunal (the tribunal) but on 4 January 2017 the tribunal
   dismissed her appeal. The decision was sent to the parties on 16  January
   2017. However, permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought  and
   granted and, on 17 May 2018,  I  decided  to  set  aside  the  tribunal's
   decision. I directed that the decision be remade in  the  Upper  Tribunal
   after a further hearing. After a succession  of  adjournments  which  had
   been granted to enable the claimant  to  supply  further  evidence,  that
   hearing finally took place on 8 February 2019. However, the claimant  was
   not present nor was her UK based sponsor. Although she had previously had
   representation she was not represented at that hearing. I shall say  more
   about that and about why I  decided  to  proceed  in  the  absence  of  a
   claimant  or  a  representative  below.  What  follows  amounts   to   an
   explanation as to how I have remade the decision and why I have  done  so
   in the terms that I have.

2. By way of background, the claimant is a national of  India  and  she  was
   born on 30 April 1999. She entered the UK  on  20  September  2012  as  a
   student. On 18 November 2014, having not overstayed or otherwise breached
   the terms of her leave, she married her UK based  sponsor  Mr  [DM].  She
   then submitted an application to the Secretary of State for her leave  to
   be varied on the basis of that marriage and the application was  received
   by the Secretary of State on 20 November 2014. With respect  to  finance,
   she provided information to the effect that Mr [M] was  employed  by  two
   different organisations, both based in Leicester,  and  that  his  annual
   income before deductions for  tax  and  national  insurance  amounted  to
   �19687.20. She provided various documents in  support.  However,  on  the
   Secretary of State's calculation based upon wage slips provided,  it  was
   concluded that his income was only �16769.36  which  was  less  than  the
   �18600  threshold  required  according  to  the  terms  of  the  relevant
   provisions contained within Appendix FM to  the  Immigration  Rules.  The
   Secretary of State, in light of that, asked himself whether the  claimant
   could establish any entitlement to further leave based upon  satisfaction
   of any other potentially applicable immigration  rules  but  decided  she
   could not. Accordingly, the application was refused and the appeal to the
   tribunal was dismissed as noted above.

3. I set aside the tribunal's decision because  I  concluded  it  had  erred
   through failing to adequately explain  its  conclusion  that  the  income
   threshold requirements had not been met and through failing  to  consider
   the case under Article 8 of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights
   (ECHR) outside the Immigration Rules. I noted  that  the  appeal  to  the
   tribunal had been bound to fail under the Immigration Rules in any  event
   because the evidential requirements as set out in Appendix FM-SE had  not
   been met and such was not, in fact, in dispute. But I  also  pointed  out
   that satisfaction of the  substantive  requirements  might  have  been  a
   relevant consideration under Article 8 of the ECHR outside the  rules  so
   that it ought to have been considered by  the  tribunal  at  least  as  a
   prelude to its' considering Article 8 outside the rules.

4. The claimant was represented at the  hearing  before  me  of  11May  2018
   which led to my set aside decision. When I issued that decision,  I  gave
   directions permitting the claimant to file further evidence regarding the
   satisfaction of the  income  threshold  and  I  also  directed  that  any
   assertions to the effect that the income threshold was satisfied  "should
   be  supported  by  clearly  expressed  mathematical   calculations   with
   reference to any documentary evidence relied upon". The appeal next  came
   before me on  25  July  2018  when,  despite  the  claimant  still  being
   represented, that had not been done. I adjourned  again.  The  case  next
   came before me on 9 October 2018 when evidential matters  concerning  the
   minimum income threshold had still not been dealt with or, at least,  not
   in the ways I had directed. The claimant was still  represented  at  that
   stage and, indeed, her counsel on that occasion  applied  for  a  further
   adjournment to enable the filing of further evidence  and  I  acceded  to
   that request. The matter was then listed for the hearing  of  8  February
   2019. However, on 5  February  2019  the  claimant  wrote  to  the  Upper
   Tribunal at Field House saying that her husband (her UK sponsor) had  had
   to travel to India as a matter of urgency  and  would  not  be  returning
   until 29 March 2019. She asked that the hearing be postponed because  she
   felt his presence at the hearing would be important as he had intended to
   give oral evidence. She asserted  that  she  would  not  receive  a  fair
   hearing if he was not present. Her application was  considered  by  Upper
   Tribunal  Judge  McWilliam  who,  on  7  February   2019,   refused   it.
   Accordingly, the matter came before me, as intended, on 8 February 2019.

5. As I have already indicated, the claimant was not in attendance  at  that
   hearing. Nor was she represented. Indeed, I noted  that  in  her  written
   application for a postponement which she had sent to the  Upper  Tribunal
   at Field House, she had said that she no longer had legal representation.
   The Secretary of State  was  represented  by  Mrs  Aboni.  There  was  no
   explanation before me as to why the claimant had not attended.  She  must
   have known that her application had been refused or, at  least,  even  if
   the decision to refuse had not reached her for some reason  or  had  been
   overlooked by her, she had no reason to assume it had been  granted.  So,
   she must have known or should have known that her  attendance  was  still
   required. She had no basis  to  assume  that  her  application  had  been
   granted merely because it had been made. Mrs Aboni pointed out that there
   had been previous adjournments and she invited me to decide the appeal in
   the absence of the claimant.

6. I decided not to adjourn. Strictly speaking I suppose there  was  not  an
   application for an adjournment before me because  the  application  which
   had been made had already been dealt  with.  But  I  thought  it  in  the
   interests of justice that I consider the matter for myself. In so doing I
   reminded myself of the "overriding objective" to be found at  rule  2  of
   the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  I  took  into
   account principles of fairness and natural justice. I took  into  account
   that there had been previous adjournments for the benefit of the claimant
   and that matters seemed not to be any further forward. It  had  not  been
   explained why it was that  the  sponsor  had  to  travel  abroad  and  no
   supporting documentary evidence regarding his travel had  been  provided.
   Had the claimant chosen to attend she could have given  evidence  herself
   which might have been sufficient to deal with  the  issues.  Her  husband
   could have prepared a  letter  or  statement  to  put  before  the  Upper
   Tribunal if he was not able to attend due to an urgent need to travel. In
   the circumstances I concluded that I should proceed.

7. I have decided to dismiss this appeal. There is  a  dispute  between  the
   claimant and the Secretary of State as to whether or not the claimant had
   demonstrated that the income threshold had been reached as at the time of
   her  application.  The  claimant  has  not  provided   the   mathematical
   calculations which I asked her to provide and has had sufficient time  to
   do so. In any event she did not meet the evidential requirements  as  set
   out in Appendix FM-SE. There is no evidence before me to suggest that she
   is able to satisfy the financial requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules
   now. As to Article 8 outside the Rules, I did not, because she chose  not
   to attend, have any up to date oral evidence from her as to why it  would
   be disproportionate to require her to return to her home country and make
   an application for entry clearance at the  appropriate  Embassy  or  High
   Commission. I did not have any up to date evidence from the sponsor as to
   matters touching upon that either.  Given  the  absence  of  up  to  date
   evidence I am not able to conclude, for the purposes of  a  consideration
   of Article 8  outside  the  Rules,  that  the  relationship  between  the
   claimant and the sponsor continues to subsist.  So,  I  am  not  able  to
   conclude that Article 8 is engaged. But assuming it  is,  as  I  say,  no
   explanation has been given as to why the claimant is not able  to  return
   to India and to make an application  for  entry  clearance  to  join  her
   husband (if that is  still  what  is  wished)  from  there.  So,  I  have
   concluded that she  has  not  demonstrated  that  any  interference  with
   Article 8 rights there might be would, on the facts, be disproportionate.

8. It follows that in remaking the decision I must  dismiss  the  claimant's
   appeal.



Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside. In remaking  the
decision, the Upper  Tribunal  dismisses  the  claimant's  appeal  from  the
Secretary of State's decision of 19 February 2015.

Anonymity has not been directed. There is no basis for  any  such  direction
and, in any event, none has been sought.
