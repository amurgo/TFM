 1. By consent and for the reasons set out in the grounds of appeal and the
     reply under Rule 24 , I set aside the determination of the Judge of
    the First-tier and remit the appeal to be heard afresh in the First-
    tier as I consider that the  requirements of the Senior President of
    Tribunal's Practice directions are met.




    Decision.

    This appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal
