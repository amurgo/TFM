                           MUHAMMAD RASHID QAYYUM
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent
      NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. The appellant by letter dated 8 December  2013  (received  8  May  2014)
    states that he wishes to withdraw his appeal. It appears that the letter
    is wrongly dated as it pre-dates the grant of permission.

 2. The consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a  party  to  withdraw
    its case. Having carefully considered the facts  of  this  appeal  as  a
    whole, and observing the response by  the  Secretary  of  State  I  give
    consent to the appellant to withdraw his case.

 3. Accordingly with my consent, and pursuant to rule 17(5) of the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  this  appeal  is  recorded  as
    "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal".  This  is  a  Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform the parties that the  appellant's  case
    is withdrawn.

 4. The effect of the  appellant's  case  being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper  Tribunal  are  at  an
    end. There is no appeal before the Upper  Tribunal  and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision shall stand.
