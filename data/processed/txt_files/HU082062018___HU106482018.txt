Representation:
For the Secretary of State:     Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondents:       Mr E Waheed, Counsel, instructed by NR Legal
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State challenges the decision of Designated First-tier
    Tribunal Judge McCarthy (the judge), promulgated on 16  November  2018,
    allowing the Respondents' appeals against the refusals of  their  human
    rights claims.

 2. Mr Rehman (hereafter, "the first Claimant") had, on  3  September  2017
    applied for an extension of his leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom
    under the Tier 1 route within  the  Immigration  Rules  ("the  Rules").
    This application was varied on 9  September  2016  to  seek  indefinite
    leave to remain on the basis of ten years' continuous lawful  residence
    in this country.  Mrs Rehman (hereafter, "the second Claimant") is  and
    always has been a dependant of her husband.

 3. In  refusing  the  applications,  the  Secretary  of  State  relied  on
    paragraph 322(5) of the Rules.  It was alleged that the first  Claimant
    had been dishonest in respect of earnings related to tax  returns  made
    for the years 2010/2011 and 2012/2013.  The figures connected to  these
    claims had been used by the first Claimant in Tier 1 applications  made
    on 5 April 2011 and 5 July 2013.

 4. The specific basis for the allegation was as follows.   In  respect  of
    the tax year 2010/2011, the Secretary of State  asserted  that  figures
    for self-employment submitted  to  HMRC  were  much  lower  than  those
    submitted to the Secretary of State  in  a  Tier  1  application.   The
    discrepancy was said to amount to a figure approaching �34,000.

 5. In respect of the tax return for the year 2012/2013, the  Secretary  of
    State  again  relied  on  an  apparent  discrepancy  in  figures,   the
    difference this time amounting to some �35,000.

 6. These seemingly very large discrepancies, together with the  timing  of
    amendments made to the tax returns,  led  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    conclude that the first Claimant had been dishonest in respect  of  his
    dealings with HMRC or the Secretary of State.

 7. It was  accepted  that  the  first  Claimant  had  accrued  ten  years'
    continuous lawful residence in the United Kingdom.




The judge's decision

 8. It is quite apparent from his decision that the judge expended a  great
    deal of time and effort in analysing the evidence before  him.   Before
    coming to that evidence, it is right to  point  out  that  the  judge's
    recitation of the Secretary of State's case against the first Claimant,
    as contained in the reasons for refusal letter, is accurately  set  out
    at [11] to [18].  It is also the case that the judge  directed  himself
    correctly as to the location of the burden and standard of  proof,  and
    the fact that paragraph 322(5) is a discretionary ground of refusal.

 9. Turning to the evidence itself, at [26]-[43] the judge  considers  with
    great care information obtained from HMRC about the two  tax  years  in
    question.  Upon analysis, the judge concludes that  the  HMRC  evidence
    was not in keeping with the particular way in which  the  Secretary  of
    State had set out his case against the first Claimant  in  the  reasons
    for refusal letter (see in particular [29]-[32]).  The judge  concluded
    that the author of that letter had misread the information provided  by
    HMRC.

10. The judge goes on to conclude that it  was  inappropriate  for  him  to
    amend or reformulate the Secretary of State's allegations  against  the
    first Claimant in light of the HMRC evidence, concluding  that  such  a
    course of action would not have been in the interests of justice, as he
    put it.  Thus, he was  only  prepared  to  consider  the  Secretary  of
    State's case on the basis on which it was set out in  the  reasons  for
    refusal letter (see [33]).  In light of this, the judge concluded  that
    there  were  significant  problems  with  the  Secretary   of   State's
    allegations.

11. However, the case had not been entirely undermined  and  therefore  the
    judge went on to  consider  evidence  sourced  from  the  Secretary  of
    State's files.  Taking the evidence as a whole the judge  was  prepared
    to accept that the Secretary of State  had  discharged  the  evidential
    burden resting upon him (see [43]-[46]).

12. The judge moves on  to  consider  the  first  Claimant's  evidence  and
    whether that, in effect, amounted to an  innocent  explanation  of  the
    Secretary of State's initial case against him.  It is right to say that
    the judge had some concerns about aspects of the first  Claimant's  own
    evidence.  These included the claim that his accountants had outsourced
    work to a subsidiary company  and  in  respect  of  the  chronology  of
    events.  In light of these concerns the judge  concluded  that  he  was
    reaching "mixed findings".

13. At this point, the judge found that the first  Claimant  had  not  been
    shown to be dishonest.

14. Other aspects of the evidence were then  considered.   Ultimately,  the
    judge  concludes  that  whilst  there  were  concerns  with  the  first
    Claimant's evidence, he had  not  been  dishonest  in  respect  of  his
    conduct towards HMRC or the Secretary of State.  At [65]  he  concludes
    that the evidence relied  upon  by  the  Secretary  of  State  was  not
    sufficiently robust to discharge the legal burden of  proof.   With  an
    implicit reference back to his analysis of the HMRC evidence  at  [32]-
    [35], the judge states that the Secretary of State's  allegations  were
    not properly drawn from that evidence.  It was noted  that  the  actual
    figures stated in the amended tax  return  to  the  two  tax  years  in
    question had not been disputed.

15. At [67] the judge concludes that the Secretary of State had  not  shown
    that the first Claimant had been dishonest.  Therefore paragraph 322(5)
    did not apply and the judge  was  satisfied  that  all  criteria  under
    paragraph 276B of the Rules had indeed been met.  This being  the  case
    the first Claimant was entitled to succeed in his appeal.

16. In respect of the second Claimant, the judge  concluded  that  she  too
    should succeed in her case and given the conclusions on  her  husband's
    appeal.



The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

17. The grounds of appeal cite three judicial review decisions of the Upper
    Tribunal in support of the contention that the judge had erred  in  his
    approach to the paragraph 322(5) issue.  It is said in particular  that
    the judge failed to have regard to the guidance set out in  R  (on  the
    application of Khan) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC), had
    erred  in  relation  to  the  evidence  about  the   first   Claimant's
    accountants, and should not have taken account of the  fact  that  HMRC
    had not imposed a penalty on the  first  Claimant  in  respect  of  the
    amended tax returns.

18. Permission to appeal was  granted  by  Designated  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Woodcraft on 21 September 2018.




The hearing before me

19. Mr Duffy relied on the grounds of appeal but quite properly in my  view
    accepted that the judge's analysis of the HMRC evidence at [26] to [32]
    was accurate in that the author of the reasons for refusal  letter  had
    appeared  to  misunderstand  what  the  figures  actually  showed.   He
    acknowledged  that  the  judge  had  relied  on  this   analysis   when
    considering whether or not the Secretary of State  had  discharged  the
    legal burden of proof (see [65]).

20. For his part Mr Waheed relied on his detailed  skeleton  argument.   He
    submitted that there were no material errors of  law.   The  judge  had
    correctly directed himself in  law  and  had  had  regard  to  all  the
    relevant evidence.




Decision on error of law

21. As I announced to the parties at the hearing, I conclude that there are
    no material errors of law in the judge's decision.

22. As I mentioned before, it is quite clear that he put in a good deal  of
    thought into this decision.  Whilst the amendments made to the two  tax
    returns in question were, as the judge put it, "peculiar"  (see  [30]),
    the judge was fully entitled (indeed he was probably bound to) conclude
    that the HMRC evidence simply did not match with the way in  which  the
    Secretary of State had put his case against the first Claimant.

23. Mr Duffy has not  sought  to  argue  that  the  judge  was  obliged  to
    reformulate the Secretary of State's case in any way.  In my view,  the
    judge was quite right to have viewed the allegations on  a  restrictive
    basis.  The Secretary of State had relevant evidence  before  him  when
    making the decision, and that decision had not been amended in any  way
    leading up to the hearing  or  indeed  at  it.   The  judge  was  fully
    entitled to proceed as he did with reference to the  comments  made  in
    [33] and [34].  The  significant  concerns  about  the  nature  of  the
    Secretary of State's allegations against the  first  Claimant  were  an
    important factor in  the  judge's  ultimate  evaluation  of  the  case.
    Somewhat unfortunately in my  view,  the  author  of  the  grounds  has
    overlooked this issue.

24. It is right that the judge in effect found that the Secretary of  State
    had discharged the evidential burden notwithstanding  the  weakness  in
    the allegations.  On one view, he may have been  somewhat  generous  to
    have done this, but that is what he did.

25. He then quite correctly turned to the first  Claimant's  rebuttal.   He
    clearly had some concerns with aspects of the Appellant's case, but  he
    was nonetheless entitled to find that the Appellant had not,  at  least
    on his evidence, being dishonest in respect of dealings  with  HMRC  or
    the Secretary of State.   The  judge,  whilst  refusing  to  admit  the
    judicial review decisions which were put to him by the first Claimant's
    Counsel and the Presenting Officer, nonetheless dealt with the  general
    points raised therein at [61].  He was right to state that the judicial
    review jurisdiction is materially different from that  of  a  statutory
    appeal.

26. The judge was entitled to find that the first Claimant's reliance  upon
    the accountant's letter was not simply a bold assertion unsupported  by
    any evidence.  There was evidence from accountants who  had  acted  for
    the  first  Claimant,  albeit  not  from  the  original  firm  or   the
    subsidiary.  The acceptance of errors  and  the  fact  that  the  first
    Claimant was suing in respect of these errors  was  a  relevant  factor
    which the judge was entitled to take into account.

27. It is right that the judge placed some reliance on the fact  that  HMRC
    had not imposed any penalties on the first Claimant.  It  may  be  that
    this constituted an error in that it is difficult to see what  evidence
    there was as to HMRC's approach to such matters.  However, in  my  view
    this potential error could be stripped away  from  the  decision  as  a
    whole and what  remains is fully sustainable.

28. The judge was entitled to conclude that the first Claimant had provided
    an innocent  explanation  to  the  Secretary  of  State's  allegations,
    bearing in mind that the threshold is not particularly high.

29. When moving on to the ultimate question of  whether  the  Secretary  of
    State had discharged the legal burden of proof, Mr Duffy  quite  fairly
    recognised that the judge was then entitled to look back at what he had
    said about the HMRC evidence at [26]-[35] and rely on this as a  factor
    that undermined the Secretary of State's  case,  with  the  consequence
    that the evidence against the  first  Claimant  was  not  "sufficiently
    robust".

30. Following  from  this  sustainable  conclusion,  the  judge  was  fully
    entitled to find that the first Claimant had  indeed  met  all  of  the
    criteria under paragraph 276B of the Rules.

31. There is no suggestion that, absent the issue of the  first  Claimant's
    appeal, the judge erred in respect of  the  second  Appellant.   It  is
    clear that her case stood or fell with that of her husband.

32. In all the circumstances,  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    stands.




Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain material errors  of
law and it shall stand.



The  Secretary  of  State's  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  therefore
dismissed.



No anonymity direction is made.
