Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Watterson, Counsel, instructed by Joseph
Thaliyan Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr J Parkinson, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

   1) In deciding  an  application  for  permission  to  appeal  the  Upper
      Tribunal against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, Immigration
      and Asylum Chamber, a judge of that Chamber should consider carefully
      the utility of  granting  permission  only  on  limited  grounds.  In
      practice, such a limited grant is unlikely to  be  as  helpful  as  a
      general grant, which  identifies  the  ground  or  grounds  that  are
      considered by the judge to have the strongest prospect of success. In
      this way, the judge identifies the likely ambit  of  the  forthcoming
      Upper Tribunal proceedings, which - if that Tribunal  concurs  -  can
      then form the backdrop  for  the  Upper  Tribunal's  subsequent  case
      management directions.


   2) Where the First-tier Tribunal judge  nevertheless  intends  to  grant
      permission only in respect of certain of the applicant's grounds, the
      judge should make this abundantly plain, both in his or her  decision
      under rule 25(5) of the Asylum and Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)
      Rules 2005 and by ensuring that the Tribunal's  administrative  staff
      send out the proper notice, informing the applicant of the  right  to
      apply to the Upper Tribunal for permission to appeal on   grounds  on
      which the applicant has been unsuccessful in the application  to  the
      First-tier Tribunal.


   3) If an applicant who has been granted  permission  to  appeal  to  the
      Upper Tribunal on limited grounds only applies to the Upper  Tribunal
      on grounds in respect of which permission has been refused, the Upper
      Tribunal judge considering that application should not regard his  or
      her task as merely some form of review of the  First-tier  Tribunal's
      decision on the application.

   4) Whatever may be the position in other Chambers of the Upper Tribunal,
      in the Immigration and Asylum Chamber the overriding objective of the
      Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  is  unlikely  to  be
      advanced by adopting a procedure whereby new grounds of appeal can be
      advanced without the permission of the Upper Tribunal under rule 5 of
      those Rules.

   5) The test enunciated by the Supreme Court in Alvi [2012] UKSC 33,  for
      deciding whether material not contained in immigration rules  can  be
      relied upon by the Secretary of State  in  making  decisions  on  the
      grant  of  leave  to  enter  or  remain,  probes  deeper   than   the
      "substantive/procedural" test articulated  in  the  wake  of  Pankina
      [2010] EWCA Civ 719, in that it articulates what makes  a  particular
      provision one that has to be included in immigration  rules:  namely,
      does it amount to  a  condition  of  succeeding  under  those  rules?
      However, there may still be difficulties  in  determining  whether  a
      particular requirement amounts to such a condition  or  is  merely  a
      "procedural" requirement.

   6) Applying Philipson (ILR - not PBS: evidence) [2012] UKUT 00039 (IAC),
      where the provisions in question are ambiguous or obscure, then it is
      legitimate to interpret the provisions by assuming that Parliament is
      unlikely to have sanctioned rules which (a) treat a limited class  of
      persons  unfairly;  and  (b)  disclose  no  policy  reason  for  that
      unfairness.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant, a citizen of the Philippines born on 14  January  1965,
    was given leave to enter the United Kingdom on 23 May 2006  as  a  work
    permit holder.  The period of her leave was until 15 May 2011  and  the
    conditions attached to that leave included  that  she  should  have  no
    recourse to public funds and that the work (and any changes to it)  had
    to be authorised.

2.    On 5 May 2011 the appellant applied for indefinite leave to remain  in
    the United Kingdom as a  work  permit  holder.  On  30  June  2011  the
    respondent made a decision to refuse to vary the appellant's  leave  to
    remain for the following reason:-

            "In view of the fact  that  you  are  currently  employed  as  a
         Senior Care Assistant  with  Southern  Cross  Healthcare  and  have
         provided payslips which show that your rate  of  pay  per  hour  is
         currently �5.93 and not at the minimum rate of pay as indicated  in
         the codes of practice guidance which stands at �7.02 per hour,  the
         Secretary  of  State  is  not  satisfied  that  your  employer  has
         certified that you are paid at or above the  appropriate  rate  for
         the job as stated in the codes of  practice  for  Tier  2  sponsors
         published by the UK Border Agency.  Therefore your application  has
         been refused."

3.    The  appellant  appealed  against  that  decision  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and on 10 August 2011 her appeal was heard at  Stoke-on-Trent
    by First-tier Tribunal Judge McDade.  Then, as now, the  appellant  was
    represented by Ms Watterson of Counsel.

4.    In a determination dated 23  August  2011,  the  judge  dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal.

5.    As in force at the date of decision, paragraph 134  (indefinite  leave
    to remain as a work permit holder) of the  Immigration  Rules  read  as
    follows:-

         "134.     Indefinite  leave  to  remain  may  be  granted   on   an
             application to a person provided:


             (i) he has spent a continuous period of 5  years  lawfully  in
                  the UK,  of which the most recent period  must  have  been
                  spent with leave as a work permit holder (under paragraphs
                  128 to 133 of these rules), and the remainder must be made
                  up of any combination of leave as a work permit holder  or
                  leave as a highly skilled migrant (under paragraph 135A to
                  135F of these rules) or leave as  a  self-employed  lawyer
                  (under the concession that appeared in chapter 6,  section
                  1 Annex E of the Immigration Directorate Instructions), or
                  leave as a writer, composer or an artist (under paragraphs
                  232 to 237 of these rules);


             (ii)      he has met the requirements of paragraph  128(i)  to
                  (v) throughout his leave as a work permit holder, and  has
                  met the requirements of paragraph 135G(ii) throughout  any
                  leave as a highly skilled migrant;


             (iii)     he is still required for the employment in question,
                  as certified by his employer;


             (iv)      his employer certifies that he is paid at  or  above
                  the appropriate rate for the job as stated in the code  of
                  practice for Tier 2 sponsors published by  the  UK  Border
                  Agency, and


             (v) he has sufficient knowledge of the  English  language  and
                  sufficient knowledge about life in the United Kingdom,  in
                  accordance with paragraph 33BA of these Rules,  unless  he
                  is under the age of 18 or aged 65 or over at the  date  of
                  his application;


             (vi)      he does not have one  or  more  unspent  convictions
                  within the meaning of the Rehabilitation of  Offenders Act
                  1974".


6.    The First-tier Tribunal Judge's determination dealt with two  matters.
     First, he considered the submission advanced  by  Ms  Watterson  that,
    since the reason for the refusal of  the  appellant's  application  was
    that the current appropriate rate for her job with Southern  Cross  was
    not at or above that stated in the code of practice, the  judgments  of
    the Court of Appeal in Pankina [2010] EWCA Civ 719 in  effect  rendered
    the respondent's reliance on that  guidance  unlawful.   Secondly,  the
    judge dealt with the submission that removal of the appellant, pursuant
    to the decision to  vary  her  leave,  represented  a  disproportionate
    interference with the appellant's private and family life rights  under
    Article 8 of the ECHR.

7.    So far as Pankina was concerned, the judge considered that  there  was
    a material difference between, on the one hand, requirements  contained
    in guidance to have held funds for certain continuous periods  and,  on
    the  other,  hourly  rates  for  particular  jobs.   The   first   such
    requirements "could have been, but  were  not,  incorporated  into  the
    Immigration Rules".  As to the second,  "it  cannot  be  expected  that
    regular changes to an  hourly  rate  for  example  to  keep  pace  with
    inflation, required changes to the Immigration Rules which would  be  a
    frequent occurrence" (paragraph 2).   The  judge  considered  that  the
    guidance in question was available to persons in the  position  of  the
    appellant and that although "it is probable that  she  had  no  control
    over her hourly rate and became increasingly disadvantaged by  it  such
    that she was having to work long hours to make a decent wage,  this  is
    not the point.  The point is that she was required to satisfy the quite
    transparent requirements and she has failed to do so".

8.    Turning to Article 8, the judge  accepted  that  the  appellant  would
    have developed friendships in the United Kingdom over the time that she
    had been here and that she also had a boyfriend.   Her  removal  would,
    consequently, constitute an interference with her right  to  a  private
    life "and ... this interference would not harm, for example immigration
    control as the Appellant is a valuable member of the UK  economy  as  a
    tax payer and  is  performing  a  useful  job".    The  fact  that  the
    appellant had developed friendships after  five  years  in  the  United
    Kingdom did not, however, give her a:

          "right to remain in the United Kingdom.  As the appellant has  not
          been able to satisfy the Immigration Rules, and as they are  there
          for the legitimate purpose of immigration control, I hold that the
          Respondent has a perfectly legitimate reason to interfere with the
          private life that she has developed in the United Kingdom.  In all
          the circumstances I hold such  a  decision  to  be  proportionate"
          (paragraph 3; original emphasis).

9.    The appellant  sought  permission  from  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal against the  judge's  determination.   She
    did so on four grounds.  The first contended that the judge  had  erred
    in law in holding that Pankina was not relevant to  the  facts  of  the
    present case.  In this regard, ground 1 prayed in aid a number of post-
    Pankina judgments.  In R (on the application of English UK  Limited)  v
    SSHD [2010] HC 1726 (Admin), Foskett J declared unlawful "the change in
    minimum educational requirements of those applying to study English  in
    the UK", purported to be set  out  in  guidance  with  the  Immigration
    Rules, on  the  basis  that  those  requirements  operated  "to  change
    materially the substantive criteria for entry for foreign students  who
    wish to study English in the  United  Kingdom"  [64].   In  R  (on  the
    application of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants) v  SSHD
    [2010] EWHC 3524 (Admin), a Divisional Court  found  that  the  interim
    limits on the number of Tier 1 and Tier 2  migrants,  set  out  on  the
    UKBA's website but not in  Immigration  Rules,  would  -  if  upheld  -
    frustrate the purpose of section 3(2)  of  the  Immigration  Act  1971.
    Thirdly, and perhaps most analogously; in  R  (on  the  application  of
    Hussain Zulfiqar Alvi) v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 681, the Court of  Appeal
    held that the "governing principle"  that  jobs  for  Tier  2  migrants
    should be at or above NVQ or SVQ level  3  "must  be  set  out  in  the
    Immigration Rules if it is to be  valid"  [40].   Jackson  LJ,  without
    deciding the point, commented that "I can see a case  for  saying  that
    the specification of specific jobs as falling within the paragraph  ...
    is a 'substantive' matter rather  than  a  'minor'  alteration  to  the
    Secretary of State's practice" [Ibid].

10.   Ground 2 asserted that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had,  in  effect,
    erred in law in not allowing the appellant's appeal on the  basis  that
    she had a "legitimate expectation that she would be  required  to  earn
    the salary specified by  her  Work  Permit  in  order  to  qualify  for
    indefinite leave to remain".  This ground pointed out  that  the  judge
    had not addressed the "legitimate expectation" issue advanced on behalf
    of the appellant, whose case was that the rate of pay she was  required
    to earn throughout her period of leave as  a  work  permit  holder  was
    unequivocally indicated on her work permit as  �11,500  per  annum  and
    that her pay exceeded  this  minimum  figure.   Paragraph  134  of  the
    Immigration Rules referred back to paragraph  128(iv),  which  required
    that an applicant  "does  not  intend  to  take  employment  except  as
    specified in his work  permit".   The  respondent's  guidance  entitled
    "Technical Changes in Employment" permitted temporary reductions in pay
    and hours for work permit holders in the current  climate,  subject  to
    certain conditions; but, if a work permit  holder's  salary  had  risen
    significantly, that is to say, above normal annual  increments  or  pay
    awards applied to all or most staff, this change  would  necessitate  a
    new  application  under  the  points-based   system.    The   appellant
    accordingly contended that her employer had not been at liberty  simply
    to have raised her wages out of line with those paid to other staff.

11.   The combination of these provisions created, according to ground 2,  a
    legitimate  expectation  "that  the  pay  rate  she  should   earn   in
    anticipation of her application for indefinite leave to remain was that
    salary set out in  her  work  permit,  for  that  particular  specified
    employment, which she was required to undertake  for  fear  of  falling
    foul of paragraphs 128(iv) and 134(ii)".  The appellant's rate of  pay,
    albeit lower than that required for Tier 2 migrants, had been  approved
    by the respondent as suitable for work permit holders.

12.   Furthermore, ground 2 submitted that the relevant  set  of  amendments
    to the  Immigration  Rules,  which  had  introduced  current  paragraph
    134(iv), did so with an explanatory note which said that the change was
    to require "work permit holders applying for leave  to  remain  ...  to
    provide confirmation that  they  continue  to  earn  at  least  the  UK
    appropriate rate for the job they are doing" (Statement of  Changes  HC
    863; explanatory note 7.13).  The "appropriate rate" in the case of the
    appellant was, it was said, determined by the respondent as �11,500 per
    annum.  The statement of changes laid before  Parliament  on  16  March
    2011 did  not  suggest  that  the  changes  to  paragraph  134  of  the
    Immigration  Rules  required  employers  to  raise  wages  rather  than
    continue to pay the rate indicated when the work permit was issued.

13.   For all those  reasons,  ground  2  submitted  that  the  respondent's
    decision was not in  accordance  with  the  law,  as  contravening  the
    appellant's legitimate expectation.

14.   Ground 3 addressed the issue of Article 8.   The  appellant  submitted
    that, once it was shown that removal in pursuance  of  the  immigration
    decision would interfere with her Article 8  rights,  it  was  for  the
    respondent to demonstrate that that interference was "lawful, necessary
    and proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued". The ground went on to
    contend that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had failed  to  engage  with
    paragraph 45 of the judgments in Pankina,  insofar  as  that  paragraph
    bore on the so-called "near-miss"  argument.   The  appellant,  it  was
    said, fell short of meeting the  Immigration  Rules  only  because  her
    employer had not raised her wages for a period of one month  between  6
    April 2011 and the date of the appellant's application on 5 May  2011.
    This was, of course, on the assumption that - contrary to the  analysis
    in ground 2 - the employer could have  acted  in  this  manner  without
    triggering the need for a different kind of application.  Nor  had  the
    judge taken account of the effects on the appellant  of  having  to  be
    uprooted from the United Kingdom and relocated again to the Philippines
    "having come to the UK in the expectation of staying in  the  UK  in  a
    category which leads to settlement".  We should add here that,  in  the
    light of Miah [2012] EWCA Civ 261, Ms Watterson did not pursue so  much
    of ground 3 as concerned the so-called near-miss argument.

15.   Finally, it  was  contended  that  the  judge  erred  in  assuming  at
    paragraph 3 of the determination that immigration control was,  without
    more, a "legitimate aim"; whereas Article 8(2) sanctioned  interference
    with such rights only in the interests of  "national  security,  public
    safety or the economic wellbeing of the country, for the prevention  of
    disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals  or  for  the
    protection of the rights and freedoms of others".  Here, there  was  no
    issue of criminality or other undesirable conduct on the  part  of  the
    appellant and the importance attached to the "economic wellbeing of the
    country" was much reduced in a  case  where,  as  here,  there  was  no
    question of the appellant becoming  a  burden  on  public  funds.   The
    appellant had, in fact, come to the United Kingdom as a response  to  a
    "pressing economic need in the  UK  -  until  6  April  2011  when  her
    profession was removed from the shortage occupation list".

16.   On 8 September 2011, a Designated Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    granted permission on ground 3 (Article 8) but not on grounds 1 and  2.
    The Designated Judge considered that ground 1 had "no merit at all"  as
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had  "pointed  out  the  rule  change
    applicable to this appellant occurred four weeks before  she  made  her
    application".  The  "legitimate  expectation"  argument  in  ground  2,
    according to the Designated Judge, ignored the fact that  "guidance  is
    regularly issued to ensure that applicants are  not  being  paid  at  a
    lower salary rate than those set out in the code of practice.   It  was
    incumbent upon the appellant and employer to ensure that she  was  paid
    at the appropriate hourly rate".

17.   In an undated letter received by  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  3  October
    2011, the appellant's solicitors contended that they did not agree that
    the grant of permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  should  be
    restricted to ground 3, as had been done by the Designated  Judge.   In
    the circumstances,  the  Upper  Tribunal  treated  that  letter  as  an
    application "to review the grant of  permission  on  limited  grounds".
    Having done so, Upper Tribunal Judge Storey  was  "satisfied  that  the
    grant of permission should be varied so as to make clear that all three
    grounds are arguable". In deciding to accept the letter, rather than an
    application made in  form  UT1,  the  Upper  Tribunal  noted  that  the
    Designated Judge had not helped matters "by not making clear  expressly
    that his grant was on limited or restricted grounds".  Had he made that
    clear, the grant would have been accompanied by a notice - IA68 - which
    stated in  terms  that  "you  may  apply  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  for
    permission to appeal on a point of  law  arising  from  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's  decision  on  any  ground  on  which  permission  has  been
    refused".

18.   At the hearing on 4 April 2012, Ms  Watterson  applied  for,  and  was
    granted, permission to amend the appellant's grounds, so as  to  add  a
    fourth one.   Since  the  original  grants  of  permission,  the  Upper
    Tribunal (Mr Justice Blake, President and Upper Tribunal  Judge  Pitt),
    in Philipson (ILR - not PBS: evidence)  [2012]  UKUT  00039  (IAC)  had
    held, in a case in many respects similar to the present  one,  that  it
    was doubtful whether paragraph 134(iv) of the Immigration Rules applies
    to those who never needed a certificate of sponsorship  with  a  salary
    level identified in guidance relating to such certificates.  The fourth
    ground is, accordingly, to the effect that the appellant  in  fact  met
    the relevant requirements of the Immigration Rules for indefinite leave
    to remain as a work permit holder.

19.   We shall deal with the issues raised in this appeal in  the  following
    order:-

    (1)    Permission to appeal granted on limited grounds only (paragraphs
         20 - 32).


    (2)     The  Pankina  issue  [and  see,  now,  Alvi  [2012]  UKSC   33]
         (paragraphs 33 - 44).


    (3)    Legitimate expectation (paragraphs 45 - 57).


    (4)    Does the appellant meet  the  requirements  of  the  immigration
         rules? (paragraphs 58 - 63)


    (5)    Article 8 of ECHR (paragraphs 64 - 68).



(1) Permission to appeal granted on limited grounds only

20.    So  far  as  relevant,  rule  25  (Tribunal's  consideration  of   an
    application for permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal)  of  the
    Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules  2005,  reads  as
    follows:-


          "25.- (1)       ...
              (2)    ...
              (3)    ...


                    (4)      Subject to rule 27, the Tribunal must  send  to
                 the parties -


                  (a)  written reasons for a decision under this rule; and


                  (b)  if the application is refused,  notification  of  the
                     right to make an application to the Upper Tribunal for
                     permission to appeal and the time  within  which,  and
                     the method by which, such application must be made.


            (5)   The Tribunal may give  permission  to  appeal  on  limited
                 grounds, but must comply with paragraph (4) in relation  to
                 any grounds on which it has refused permission."


21.   As has already been noted, when the First-tier  Tribunal,  Immigration
    and Asylum Chamber grants permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    only on limited grounds, a notice (IA68) is (or ought to be) sent  with
    the limited grant, informing the applicant for permission  that  he  or
    she may "apply to the Upper Tribunal for  permission  to  appeal  on  a
    point of law arising from the First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  on  any
    ground on which permission  has  been  refused".   A  reading  of  rule
    25(4)(b) and (5) of the 2005 Rules makes it evident that form  IA68  is
    the means by which FTTIAC ensures compliance with those  provisions  of
    the Rules.  In the present case, form IA68 was not sent  out  with  the
    Designated Judge's grant of permission, limited to ground  3.   As  the
    Upper Tribunal noted in its grant of permission on grounds 1 and 2, the
    Designated Judge failed to make clear that his  grant  was  on  limited
    grounds only.  Had the Designated Judge  done  so,  the  applicant  for
    permission would have realised that, in order  to  seek  permission  on
    grounds 1 and 2,  she  needed  to  apply  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  for
    permission to appeal on those grounds.  As Mr Parkinson indicated on 4
    April, the Practice Directions of the Senior President of February 2010
    state that the form to be used for applying to the Upper  Tribunal  for
    permission to appeal to that  Tribunal  is  that  for  the  time  being
    specified on the relevant website. That is form UT1.

22.   It is necessary at this stage to make two general points.   First,  as
    the present case illustrates, if on an application  for  permission  to
    appeal the First-tier Tribunal, Immigration and Asylum Chamber  intends
    to grant permission only in respect of certain of the grounds, then the
    judge considering that application should make it abundantly plain that
    this is so, both in his  or  her  decision  under  rule  25(5)  and  by
    ensuring that the Tribunal's administrative staff send out  the  proper
    notice (currently IA68) so as to comply with rule 25(5). It should also
    be noted that rule 25(4)(a) requires "written reasons  for  a  decision
    under this rule", which means that written reasons  are  required  both
    for granting an application on particular grounds and for refusing  the
    application on particular grounds.

23.   Secondly, as  a  practical  matter,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  should
    consider carefully the utility of granting permission only  on  limited
    grounds.  Given that the effect of any grant of permission to the Upper
    Tribunal is to set in train proceedings on the case in question in  the
    Upper Tribunal, a grant of permission on limited grounds will  not,  in
    practice, often be as helpful to the parties or to the  Upper  Tribunal
    as would a general grant of permission  by  reference  to  all  of  the
    applicant's grounds, which nevertheless expressly identifies the ground
    or grounds that are considered by the First-tier Tribunal to  have  the
    strongest prospect of success.  In this way,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    identifies  the  likely  ambit  of  the  forthcoming   Upper   Tribunal
    proceedings, which - if that Tribunal  concurs  -  can  then  form  the
    backdrop for the Upper Tribunal's subsequent case management directions
    under rule 5 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
    ("the Upper Tribunal Rules").   It  should  also  be  noted  that  rule
    15(1)(a) and (b) of those Rules expressly enables the Upper Tribunal to
    give directions as to the issues  on  which  it  requires  evidence  or
    submissions and the nature of the evidence or submissions it requires.

24.   As the present appeal testifies, once  permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal has been granted, either by the First-tier  Tribunal  or
    by the Upper Tribunal, the grounds on which such  permission  has  been
    granted by either or both Tribunals may be amended with the  permission
    of the Upper Tribunal (rule 5(3)(c)) of the Upper Tribunal Rules).

25.    In at least some of the jurisdictions falling  within  the  ambit  of
    the Upper Tribunal, the importance of an appellant's grounds of  appeal
    is, it seems, questionable.  Thus in DL - H  v  Devon  Partnership  NHS
    Trust [2010] UKUT 102(AAC) Upper Tribunal Judge Jacobs,  in  an  appeal
    from the Health, Education and Social Care Chamber  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, rejected "the argument that an appeal is necessarily  limited
    to the grounds in the application on which  permission  was  given  and
    that further permission is required to raise  other  grounds."   Having
    regard to the overriding objective in rule  2  of  the  Upper  Tribunal
    Rules, he found that "as a matter of interpretation, it  would  not  be
    fair and just to restrict the scope of an appeal to the grounds in  the
    application on which permission was given".

26.     Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Jacobs   considered,   however,   that   his
    interpretation:

          "would not allow a party  complete  freedom  to  raise  additional
          grounds at will.  The Upper Tribunal has ample  power  to  control
          the issues that will be considered on an appeal.  As well  as  the
          possibility of giving limited permission, rule 15(1)(a) authorises
          the Tribunal to give directions as  to  the  issues  on  which  it
          requires submissions.  In an extreme case, the Tribunal  may  even
          strike out all or part of a party's case under rule  8(3).   Those
          provisions should be sufficient to ensure that additional  grounds
          are only considered if that will be fair and just". [3]

27.   In the Immigration and Asylum jurisdiction, we do  not  consider  that
    the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007,  read  with  the  Upper
    Tribunal Rules, is such as to excuse a party from  the  requirement  to
    seek and obtain the permission of the Upper Tribunal in order to  raise
    grounds which are not already before the Upper  Tribunal.   Proceedings
    in immigration and asylum appeals are considerably more adversarial  in
    nature than in many, at least, of  the  jurisdictions  covered  by  the
    Administrative Appeals Chamber.  We do not consider that the overriding
    objective is, in general, likely to be advanced by adopting a procedure
    in which new grounds can be advanced  without  the  permission  of  the
    Tribunal.  It should also be noted  that,  in  immigration  and  asylum
    appeals, the Upper Tribunal does not have power to strike out the whole
    or part of a party's case, other than for want  of  jurisdiction  (rule
    8(1A) and (2)(a) of the Upper Tribunal Rules).

28.   As is made plain at [4] of  DL-H, Upper Tribunal Judge Jacobs did,  in
    fact, proceed on the  basis  that  some  form  of  permission,  however
    described, was necessary:

          "Turning to the application of this approach to the  circumstances
          of this case, I consider that it is fair and  just  to  allow  the
          appellant to raise his additional grounds".


29.  Whether, as we consider to be the position, a  party  needs  permission
    under rule 5 in order to pursue further grounds  or,  as  in  the  AAC,
    permission becomes relevant at some other, later stage,  in  all  cases
    the Upper Tribunal must proceed pursuant to the overriding objective of
    enabling cases before it to be dealt  with  fairly  and  justly.   That
    requirement involves giving due consideration, not just to the position
    of each of the parties to the appeal, but  also  to  the  interests  of
    other parties with cases before the Upper Tribunal, the  resolution  of
    which may be adversely affected by a policy of  permitting  parties  to
    cause delay by raising  issues  at  the  last  minute  and/or  pursuing
    irrelevant or otherwise unmeritorious lines of argument.

30.   In describing the way in which the present appellant was permitted  to
    advance grounds 1 and 2 of her grounds of appeal, it will be noted that
    the Upper Tribunal, in December 2011, treated the appellant's letter to
    that Tribunal as "an application to review the grant of  permission  on
    limited grounds", leading to a decision that "the grant  of  permission
    should be varied" (paragraph 17  above).   As  can  be  seen  from  the
    foregoing analysis, however, it is not in fact correct  to  regard  the
    process merely as some form of review of what the  First-tier  Tribunal
    has decided on the application.  Rather,  the  procedure  involves  the
    applicant who has been unsuccessful in respect of one or more of  their
    grounds making application to the  Upper  Tribunal  for  permission  to
    appeal on those grounds.

31.    Before leaving the issue of permission to appeal, it is necessary  to
    make one final point. Whatever  the  grounds  on  which  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal has been granted, once the Upper  Tribunal
    has set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, any re-making of
    the decision under section 12(2)(b)(ii) of the  Tribunals,  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 is not necessarily limited by reference to  errors
    of law identified in  those  grounds,  or  in  any  grounds  that  have
    subsequently been permitted to be argued, and which  have  resulted  in
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal being set aside.  Further,  the
    ambit of the re-making task will not necessarily depend on  whether  an
    issue has been raised before the First-tier Tribunal.

32.    This point emerges from the  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
    Kizhakudan v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 566. The Court held  that  the  Upper
    Tribunal had  erred  in  refusing  to  consider  submissions  regarding
    Article 8 of the ECHR, when that Tribunal was re-making a decision:-


          "[30] ... SIJ Waumsley  considered  that  he  could  not  consider
          article 8 unless IJ Widdup had erred in law in failing to consider
          it. He therefore put it out of his hands to  consider  whether  he
          ought to look at the matter in terms of article 8. In my judgment,
          however, SIJ Waumsley had a discretion to consider the  article  8
          point, even if, as he was entitled to think,  the  point  had  not
          been properly raised  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  nor  by  any
          respondent's notice. It  is  plain,  however,  that  SIJ  Waumsley
          refused to consider his discretion ..."


          ...


          [33] In these circumstances, I  conclude  ...  that  SIJ  Waumsley
          erred  in  law  in  rejecting  out  of  hand  any  possibility  of
          considering the article 8 issue, on the mistaken  ground  that  he
          could not do so unless he found that IJ Widdup had erred in law in
          not considering it ..." (Rix LJ; original emphases).


(2) The Pankina issue

33.  At the time of the hearing in this appeal and when  this  determination
    was being prepared, Pankina remained the leading case on the matter  of
    the proper relationship between, on the  one  hand,  immigration  rules
    made under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1971  and,  on  the  other,
    guidance and other similar written published materials, not within  the
    ambit of section 3 and which may be amended from time to  time  by  the
    respondent without the involvement  of  Parliament.   We  have  already
    referred at paragraph 9 above to a number of cases in which the Pankina
    principle has fallen to be applied.  It is plain from those cases  that
    somewhat different approaches were taken in  attempting  to  articulate
    the principle or "test" that might identify matters that  require,  for
    their legal  efficacy,  to  be  contained  in  immigration  rules.   In
    particular, on  several  occasions  a  distinction  was  drawn  between
    substantive requirements and procedural requirements  (or  requirements
    of process) (see eg R (on the application of Ahmed) v SSHD [2011]  EWHC
    2855 (Admin)).

34.   This distinction had nothing to do with whether the provisions of  the
    guidance actually relied on by the respondent in a particular case were
    or were not in existence at the date when the corresponding immigration
    rules were laid before Parliament under the  1971  Act.  A  superficial
    reading of the case law - particularly  R  v  Secretary  of  State  for
    Social Services ex p Camden LBC [1987] 1 WLR 819 - might  suggest  that
    the immigration rules could rely upon an outside  sourse,  of  whatever
    kind  and  for  any  purpose,  provided  that  source  is  extant   and
    accessible.  But  the  mere  fact  that  the  source  satisfies   those
    requirements is not, in fact, sufficient. This was explained by  Sedley
    LJ in Pankina: "... the objection is not to rules which rely on outside
    sources for evidence of compliance. It is to  rules  which  purport  to
    supplement themselves by  further  rules  derived  from  an  extraneous
    source, whether that source is the rule-maker him-or herself or a third
    party" [27]. "Albeit the first  version  of  the  policy  guidance  was
    brought into being within the 40 days allowed by section 3(2)  [of  the
    Immigration Act 1971] for the parliamentary procedure, it has been open
    to change at any time. It is this, rather than the fact that it has  in
    the event been changed, which ... is in my view critical. It means that
    a discrete element of the rules is placed beyond Parliament's  scrutiny
    and left to the unfettered judgment of the rule-maker" [29].

35.   We  delayed  finalising  this  determination,  in  the  light  of  the
    imminence of the Supreme Court's decision in Alvi. The judgment in that
    case of has  now  been  given  ([2012]  UKSC  33).  Since  the  present
    appellant would succeed, whether one applies Pankina or,  as  one  must
    now do, Alvi, and given that, as we shall explain, the appellant  would
    in any event be entitled to succeed in her appeal, we did not  consider
    it necessary to invite further submissions from the parties.

36.   The Secretary of State's appeal against the judgment of the  Court  of
    Appeal in Alvi was dismissed. In doing so, the Supreme Court (per  Lord
    Dyson) chose  not  to  endorse  the  substantive/procedural  test  but,
    instead, adopted the following test:

                    "[94] ... a rule is  any  requirement  which  a  migrant
          must satisfy as a condition of being given leave to enter or leave
          to remain, as well as any provision "as to the  period  for  which
          leave is to  be  given  and  the  conditions  to  be  attached  in
          different circumstances" (there can be no doubt about  the  latter
          since it is expressly  provided  for  in  section  3(2))  [of  the
          Immigration Act 1971]. I would exclude  from  the  definition  any
          procedural requirements which do not have to  be  satisfied  as  a
          condition of the grant of leave to enter or remain. But  it  seems
          to me that any requirement which, if not satisfied by the migrant,
          will lead to an application for leave to  enter  or  remain  being
          refused is a rule within the meaning of section 3(2).

                       .................................

                       [96]    It  seems  to  me  that  this  approach  best
          reflects what Parliament must be taken to have  intended  when  it
          enacted section 3(2). There is no evidence that it would be unduly
          burdensome,  let  alone  administratively   unworkable   for   the
          Secretary of State. It causes her no administrative difficulty  to
          make the most detailed rules and then lay them before  Parliament.
          I acknowledge the burdens that would be imposed  on  the  Scrutiny
          Committee to which Lord Hope refers at para 65. It is, however,  a
          striking fact  that  the  immigration  rules  are  already  hugely
          cumbersome.  The  complexity  of  the  machinery  for  immigration
          control has (rightly) been the subject of frequent  criticism  and
          in urgent need of attention. But it is not relevant to the present
          issue.

                      [97] If the boundary is drawn where I have  suggested,
          that should introduce a degree of certainty which ought to  reduce
          the scope for legal challenges. The key requirement  is  that  the
          immigration rules should include all those  provisions  which  set
          out criteria which are or may be determinative of the  application
          for leave to enter or remain."

 37.    It can immediately be seen that  Lord  Dyson's  test  probes  deeper
      than does the substantive/procedural test, since it  articulates  what
      makes  a  particular  provision  one  that  has  to  be  included   in
      immigration rules: namely, does it amount to a condition of succeeding
      under those rules? But even  Lord  Dyson's  test  is  not  a  panacea.
      Although he and Lord  Hope  were  in  agreement  that  (applying  Lord
      Dyson's test) the requirement to achieve an appropriate rate  of  pay,
      specified in guidance, was one that had to be in  a  immigration  rule
      and was therefore legally ineffective (and that this was determinative
      of Mr Alvi's case), they disagreed as to whether  "information  as  to
      where to look to assess the state of the resident labour market" was a
      requirement that had to be in the rules (see [58] to [63] and [103] to
      [106]).  Lord Walker expressed no opinion on this disagreement  [109],
      whilst Lord Clarke [124]  and  Lord  Wilson  [129]  agreed  with  Lord
      Dyson's conclusions.

38.      Acknowledging the disagreement, Lord Hope said this:-

          "But the fact that Lord Dyson and I differ as to  whether  changes
          in  the  list  of  newspapers,   journals   and   websites   where
          advertisements may be placed for  the  purposes  of  the  resident
          labour market test are changes to the rules may serve as a warning
          that the wiser  course  is  to  assume  that  everything  that  is
          contained in a rule-making document such as that which  is  before
          us in this case is caught by the  requirement  that  section  3(2)
          sets out, and that any changes to any  of  the  material  that  it
          contains must be laid before Parliament". [65]


 39.    The judgments in Alvi are, of  course,  determinative  of  what,  in
      this determination, we  have  still  called  the  Pankina  issue.  The
      respondent cannot rely on the required hourly rates contained  in  the
      guidance, in order to refuse the appellant's application for leave  to
      remain. This is, on the assumption that, irrespective of  the  Pankina
      issue, the guidance had operative effect (as to which,  see  paragraph
      44 below).

40.    Before leaving Alvi, in view of what we have  said  at  paragraph  34
      above, it is necessary to make clear the following. There  is  nothing
      in  the  judgment  of  the  Supreme  Court  that  suggests  its  newly
      identified test turns on whether guidance of the Secretary  of  State,
      or other non-rules material that she can subsequently  amend,  was  or
      was not in existence at the date any associated changes in immigration
      rules were laid before Parliament pursuant to section 3  of  the  1971
      Act. If, applying Lord Dyson's test, the pre-existing material amounts
      in substance to an immigration rule, it is invalid, as not having been
      through the section 3 process.

41.      At [24] Lord Hope noted counsel for Mr Alvi as having:-

          "made it clear that it was not his case that  no  change  whatever
          could be made to details set out in  the  other  document  without
          laying that change before Parliament. It  would  be  open  to  the
          Secretary of State to include in the rule a formula  or  criterion
          for making changes which could be applied  objectively  and  could
          not be the subject of controversy, such as for the  adjustment  of
          rates of pay according to the Retail Prices Index. Although it  he
          said that he was inclined to say that everything  should  be  laid
          before  Parliament  because  to  do  otherwise  would  enable  the
          Secretary of State to introduce hurdles in the way  of  applicants
          which  were  not  subject  to  Parliamentary   scrutiny,   it   is
          questionable whether the submission goes too far, given the extent
          and nature of all the details set out in the Occupation  Codes  of
          Practice on UKBA's website. But it would not be right  for  us  to
          hold that it goes too far unless we can say where,  and  how,  the
          line is to be drawn between those changes which it is open to  the
          Secretary of State to make without  reference  to  Parliament  and
          those that must be subjected to Parliamentary scrutiny".


42.      Since, as we have seen, the Supreme Court did find itself  able  to
      say how the line is to be drawn (albeit that precisely where remains a
      potentially case-sensitive matter), it would seem that the Court  did,
      in the end, agree with the proposition Mr Alvi's counsel indicated  he
      was "inclined to say". There is, however, nothing in the judgment that
      we consider contradicts the position taken by Mr Drabble QC, regarding
      the "RPI" example earlier in [24]; although the thrust of the judgment
      is such that there can only be very  limited  scope  indeed  for  such
      instances. To summarise on this issue:


          (a)  Any  provisions  in  "pre-existing"  materials  that  contain
          criteria that are or may be determinative of an application are of
          no legal effect;


          (b)  That is so, whether or not the materials are capable of being
          changed; but


          (c) There may be scope for an immigration rule to make  reference,
          as a requirement for leave to enter or remain, to  a  (necessarily
          pre-existing) formula or criterion that  is  (i)  uncontroversial;
          and (ii)  operates  independently  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
          functions under the Immigration Act 1971.

 43.   Even before the Supreme Court's judgment in Alvi, it was  clear  that
    the  application  of  Pankina  did  not   involve   considerations   of
    administrative convenience, contrary to what  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    judge thought in this case. As we have seen, the judgment  specifically
    considered and rejected the Secretary of State's submissions that  were
    based  on  the  asserted  administrative   convenience   of   including
    requirements in materials that  were  not  laid  before  Parliament  as
    immigration rules.  The fact that the rates paid for a  particular  job
    may need to be frequently altered does not  enable  the  respondent  to
    deal with those substantive requirements - which they plainly are -  by
    means of guidance and the  like.   They  need  to  be  incorporated  in
    immigration rules. The determination of the  First-tier  judge  is,  in
    fact, a good example of the problems that would arise if judicial fact-
    finders were required to determine the legal efficacy of  materials  by
    reference to considerations of administrative convenience.   The  judge
    seems to have taken it upon himself to infer that the  requirements  of
    specifying rates of pay would be onerous.  But there  appears  to  have
    been no evidence before him in that regard.

44.   In conclusion, we  accept  Ms  Watterson's  submission  that,  in  the
    present case, if a requirement existed for the appellant  to  meet  the
    minimum rate of pay indicated in the code of practice, that requirement
    was unlawful.  We emphasise the word "if" in  the  preceding  sentence.
    As will be apparent, on the facts of this case, we do not find that the
    requirement existed.


(3) Legitimate expectation

45.   Relying on the judgment of Sir George Newman in HSMP Forum  Limited  v
    SSHD [2008] EWHC 664 (Admin), the appellant submits that, on  a  proper
    interpretation of the work permit scheme pursuant to which she came  to
    the  United  Kingdom,  she  has  a  legitimate  expectation  that   the
    respondent would not change the requirements that she had to  meet,  in
    order to be accepted for settlement in this country.  What emerges from
    that case, we consider, is that the concept of  legitimate  expectation
    is not a separate legal principle but, rather, falls to be regarded  as
    an aspect of the over-arching (and developing) public law duty  to  act
    fairly.  Thus, at [49] Sir George Newman noted the warning of the Court
    of Appeal in Nadarajah [2005] EWCA Civ 1369, not to construct  separate
    compartments of law where, in truth, a single principle or interlocking
    principles are in play.

46.   At [49] Sir George Newman found that the "conflict to which this  case
    gives rise requires the  Court  to  establish  a  balance  between  the
    importance  of  preserving  the  defendant's  right  to  exercise   her
    discretionary powers in  the  field  of  immigration  control  and  the
    desirability of requiring her to adhere to the statements  or  practice
    announced in connection with the original HSMP".  In  order  to  answer
    that question, the court was required to apply a  "contextual  analysis
    of the purpose in terms of the HSMP up to November 2006" [52].

47.   The judgment makes it plain that in finding against the  Secretary  of
    State, Sir George Newman regarded it as particularly important that the
    Secretary of  State  had  publicly  stated  that  the  requirements  or
    conditions to be met by an HSMP in order to achieve settlement  in  the
    United Kingdom, would not be changed  to  that  person's  disadvantage,
    once he or she had arrived here pursuant to the scheme.  Thus, although
    "it would not have been inconsistent with nor inimical  to  the  scheme
    for it to be expressly stated that admission to it  gave  no  guarantee
    that the criteria at the extension stages would not change  during  the
    migrant's participation in the scheme", Sir George Newman held that the
    Secretary of State could not "escape from the  consequences  of  having
    failed to make that clear".

48.   The judge considered the arguments of  the  Secretary  of  State,  who
    contended that the public interest in making changes to the HSMP scheme
    outweighed any unfairness to particular individuals.  Sir George Newman
    concluded,  however,  that  he  did  "not  regard   the   issue   under
    consideration  as  touching  important  economic  interests  which  are
    centred upon the policy aim of establishing a more effective scheme for
    a future applicant" [60]. On the contrary, he  was  "unable  to  see  a
    sufficient public interest which outweighs the unfairness, which  I  am
    satisfied the changes visit  upon  those  already  admitted  under  the
    programme.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the terms of  the
    original scheme should be honoured and there  is  no  good  reason  why
    those already on the scheme should not enjoy  the  benefits  of  it  as
    originally offered to them.  Good  administration  and  straightforward
    dealing with the public require it".

49.   We agree with Mr Parkinson  that  there  are  significant  differences
    between, on the one hand, the HSMP scheme, and the way it was "sold" to
    certain applicants and, on the other hand, the work permit scheme  with
    which we are concerned.  In the case of the latter  scheme,  there  has
    not been, at any point, a requirement for those embarking on it to make
    the United Kingdom their principal home, thereby severing or  at  least
    reducing ties with their homelands.  Furthermore, there  have  not,  so
    far as we have been made aware, ever  been  public  pronouncements,  as
    there were in respect of the HSMP scheme, to the effect that conditions
    for eventual settlement in the United Kingdom would remain the same.

50.   For these reasons, we conclude that the appellant  cannot  succeed  in
    challenging the immigration decision in her case, by reference to  that
    part of the public law duty of fairness that falls to be categorised as
    legitimate expectation.

51.   That conclusion is not, however, the end of  the  matter,  so  far  as
    fairness is concerned.  One must beware  drawing  a  demarcation  line,
    whereby issues of fairness are confined  to  the  realm  of  legitimate
    expectation and, if found not to meet the requirements  of  that  test,
    are then precluded from having any  interaction  with  other  forms  of
    legal scrutiny of administrative action.

52.   Even if the appellant cannot point to a  legitimate  expectation  that
    she would be permitted to proceed towards settled status in the  United
    Kingdom, on the same  basis  that  existed  when  she  came  here,  the
    position in which she finds herself still raises fairness issues, which
    require legal scrutiny.   As  the  Tribunal  found  in  Philipson,  the
    appellant:

           "was admitted under a work permit valid for five years  when  at
          the time of her admission and throughout nearly  the  entirety  of
          her stay here the Immigration Rules  134  indicated  that  if  she
          abided by the terms of the work permit and did not act in a manner
          contrary to public policy she  would  be  entitled  to  indefinite
          leave to remain at the end of the five  year  period.   One  month
          before the conclusion of the  five  year  period,  the  settlement
          requirements were amended to impose a novel requirement of a  wage
          that met the minimum set out in guidance to Tier 2 sponsors" [16].




53.   As the Tribunal held, the "intrinsic lack  of  justice  in  this  case
    comes from the attempt at the 59th month of her  60th  month  stay,  to
    impose wage conditions on her that  were  irrelevant  to  the  original
    grant of the work permit.  She was unaware of the need to  comply  with
    these conditions, although we recognise that the application form  rule
    10B does alert the keen reader to a footnote 9 on page 37 from which  a
    reference to the  UKBA  website  and  the  codes  of  guidance  can  be
    obtained" [17].

54.   As with Philipson, the fact that a fair-minded and  reasonable  reader
    of the rules, looking at the precise position of this appellant,  would
    regard her as someone who might reasonably be expected to be allowed to
    continue  on  her  path  to  settlement,  means   that   the   contrary
    interpretation of the provisions in question, as contended for  by  the
    respondent, requires to be closely analysed.  That is  particularly  so
    of the transitional provisions, to which we shall shortly turn.

55.  This is  not  in  any  way  to  suggest  that  ordinary  principles  of
    statutory interpretation are to be displaced.  In  particular,  if,  on
    proper analysis, the respondent's contention is supported by the  plain
    and ordinary meaning of the  rules,  then  considerations  of  fairness
    cannot produce a different interpretative result.  However,  where  the
    provisions in question are ambiguous or obscure, which  is  regrettably
    often the case where the rules comprise or  have  an  interaction  with
    points-based rules, then it is legitimate to interpret  the  provisions
    by assuming that Parliament is unlikely to have sanctioned rules  which
    (a) treat a limited class of persons  unfairly;  and  (b)  disclose  no
    policy reason for that unfairness.

56.   We will revert to that issue in the next  section,  when  we  consider
    the submissions on the question of whether, in fact, the appellant  has
    met the relevant requirements of the immigration rules.

57.  A further way in which fairness issues  interrelate  with  other  legal
    principles is in relation to Article 8 ECHR.  This interaction is  made
    plain at [19] to [23] of Philipson. In short, issues  of  fairness  can
    have a material part to play  in  determining  the  proportionality  of
    giving effect to an  immigration  decision,  which  interferes  with  a
    person's private and/or family life in the United Kingdom.


(4) Does the appellant meet the requirements of the immigration rules?

58.   Adopting the approach we have  set  out  above,  it  is  necessary  to
    consider the parties' submissions on whether the appellant has met  the
    requirements of the immigration rules.  Relying on dicta in  Philipson,
    Ms Watterson, for the appellant, submitted that she had.  At  [14]  the
    Tribunal in that case said:-

        "14.     First, although  we  will  assume  for  present  purposes,
             without deciding, that there is an appropriate salary rate  for
             the claimant's job issued under the Tier 2 guidance on 6  April
             2011 because transitional arrangement D applies to her, we  are
             far  from  convinced  that  this  is  the  case.   Transitional
             arrangement D refers to those who hold a Tier 2 certificate  of
             sponsorship and the certificate of  sponsorship  confirms  that
             the holder will be working as a senior care assistant (SOC code
             6115).  As  we  understand  it  the  claimant  never  needed  a
             certificate of sponsorship  because  she  came  under  the  old
             system and not the new PBS one and accordingly never held  one.
             If there was no guidance as to the salary level  applicable  to
             her, then  rule  134(iv)  would  not  apply  and  her  clam  to
             settlement should have been granted without more."


59.   Ms Watterson's submissions on this issue are clearly set  out  in  her
    "Further Submissions" document for the hearing on 4 April:-

         "14.     The importance of this point lies in  the  fact  that  the
             code of practice for job code 6115, that is care assistant and
             home carers, gives two alternative 'appropriate salary rates'.
              The first rate is for 'New applications under Tier 2': �7.80
             per hour.  The second rate  is  for  'Applications  under  the
             transitional  arrangements'  [original  emphasis]:  �7.02  per
             hour.   Applicants in the Appellant's position plainly do  not
             fall within the  first  category  of  applicants.   Unless  an
             application under paragraph 134 is an application  "under  the
             transitional arrangements" then it  cannot  properly  be  held
             that any 'appropriate rate' has been specified in the codes of
             practice or applies to the Appellant.


         15.      A copy of transitional arrangement D is appended  to  this
             skeleton argument.  The UKBA website  at  the  relevant  time,
             made clear that it was only transitional arrangement  D  which
             applied to senior care workers.  The  arrangement  contains  a
             concession that those switching from the  Work  Permit  scheme
             into Tier 2 are not required to score points under a number of
             the headings usually applicable to Tier 2  migrants.  However,
             these switching applicants are  still  required  to  obtain  a
             certificate of sponsorship from a licensed sponsor and it must
             confirm the appropriate rate of pay under  code  6115.    Work
             Permit  holders  have  never  been  required   to   obtain   a
             certificate of sponsorship.


         16.      As regards work permit holders who have been in the UK  in
             a eligible category for 5 years the arrangement simply reads:


                  'Where you have currently been in the UK  in  an  eligible
                  category for five years or more and wish  to  extend  your
                  stay, you must apply under the  full  points-based  system
                  criteria. Alternatively, you may apply for settlement.'


         17.      The website thus makes clear that  the  concession  as  to
             points afforded to those switching into Tier 2 does  not  apply
             to those who have already accrued the five years  necessary  to
             qualify for  settlement.   Applicants  in  this  position  must
             either apply under the full points-based criteria or apply  for
             settlement.


         18.      In the premises the Appellant submits that,  as  aired  in
             Philipson, there is no "appropriate rate" of pay applicable  to
             Work Permit holders only 1) a rate for new applicants and 2)  a
             rate  for  those  switching  into  Tier  2  under  transitional
             arrangement D.  As such,  it  was  not  lawfully  open  to  the
             Respondent to  refuse  the  Appellants'  applications  on  this
             basis."


60.    It  is  with  no  disrespect  to  Mr  Parkinson,  who  advanced   the
    respondent's case as  ably  as  could  be  done,  that  we  conclude  Ms
    Watterson's submissions are correct and that, even if  one  assumes  (as
    cannot be the case) that Pankina and (now) Alvi did not  disentitle  the
    respondent from  specifying  an  applicable  hourly  rate  by  means  of
    guidance, on the facts of the appellant's case, neither  the  rules  nor
    that guidance required her to meet any "appropriate rate  of  pay".   Mr
    Parkinson submitted that, of the possible figures,  applying  the  lower
    rate of �7.02 to the appellant would  not  result  in  her  suffering  a
    disadvantage.   Since  this  is  precisely  the  basis  upon  which  the
    appellant's application was refused by the respondent, we cannot  accept
    that submission.

61.  As we understood Mr Parkinson, he agreed  with  Ms  Watterson,  to  the
    extent that transitional arrangement D did not apply to  the  appellant.
    However, Mr Parkinson submitted that the last paragraph of  transitional
    arrangement D applied only to people who  were  not  in  a  transitional
    category:-

         "Where you have currently been in the UK in  an  eligible  category
         for five years or more and wish to extend your stay, you must apply
         under the full points-based system  criteria.   Alternatively,  you
         may apply for settlement".


62.   Whilst we accept that the consequence of our finding is that a  person
    in the position of the appellant, who had not already been in the UK in
    an eligible category for five years or more, can apply for  settlement,
    just like a person who had been, the respondent  cannot  get  over  the
    point that  the  appellant  simply  does  not  have  a  certificate  of
    sponsorship (and could not have been given one).  Likewise, that  final
    paragraph of transitional arrangement D cannot, in our  view,  properly
    have the effect of requiring the appellant to show that she was paid at
    �7.02 per hour.

63.   In so finding, we have applied the approach to interpretation set  out
    in  paragraphs  54  and  55  above.   Given  that  the  effect  of  the
    respondent's  construction  of  the  immigration  rules   and   related
    published materials  would  result  in  a  degree  of  unfairness,  the
    justification for which has not been explained, we consider that it  is
    unlikely Parliament would have permitted the relevant immigration rules
    to pass  the  section  3   "scrutiny"  process  or,  indeed,  that  the
    respondent  herself  would  have  so  drawn  those  rules  if,  as  now
    contended, they operate so as to deny the appellant the opportunity  of
    making an application for settlement in the United Kingdom.


(5) Article 8

64.   At the hearing on 4 April, we  set  aside  the  determination  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal and indicated that we would re-make the decision in
    the appeal on all relevant grounds, including (if necessary) Article 8.
     We heard oral evidence from the appellant, who spoke  to  her  witness
    statement, in which she explained that she was in a  relationship  with
    her partner, Mr Vernon, whom she had met in May 2011.  We are satisfied
    that the appellant and Mr Vernon are cohabiting; although there  was  a
    discrepancy in the evidence given by the appellant  and  by  Mr  Vernon
    (from whom we also heard) as to the reason  it  had  taken  until  only
    recently for the couple to begin full-time cohabitation.  Mr Vernon  is
    a British citizen  who  works  on  the  "metering  side"  for  Southern
    Electric.  The appellant is currently receiving  treatment  for  breast
    cancer and Mr Vernon told us that  he  would  be  attending  her  next
    chemotherapy session, scheduled for 5 April.

65.   There is no doubt that the appellant has, during her time  the  United
    Kingdom, established a degree of private life, not only by reference to
    her occupation but also through the friends she  has  acquired  in  the
    process.  Additionally,  we  accept  that  she  has,  albeit  recently,
    established a relationship with Mr Vernon. Despite the  discrepancy  to
    which we have referred, we do not find that this relationship has  been
    entered into for the purpose of enabling the appellant to remain in the
    United Kingdom.  The parties told us that they had deferred their plans
    to get married until the appellant's immigration status  was  resolved.
    One might regard that as evincing a lack of commitment on either  side;
    but Mr Parkinson did not submit that that was how we should regard  it;
    and we do not in any event do so.

66.    We  would,  therefore,  find   ourselves   having   to   assess   the
    proportionality of the appellant's removal on her Article 8 private and
    family life  rights.   In  view  of  our  earlier  findings,  that  the
    appellant meets the requirements of the  immigration  rules  and  that,
    even if she did not, the immigration decision in her  case  is  not  in
    accordance with the law for Pankina (and, now, Alvi) reasons, there  is
    no question of her being removed from the United Kingdom in consequence
    of that decision.

67.  Were that not to be the case,  however,  we  would  conclude  that  the
    appellant's removal would constitute  a  disproportionate  interference
    with her Article 8 rights. In this regard, we should make it plain that
    we would answer questions 3 and 4 of the five questions in paragraph 17
    of Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27  in  the  affirmative.   That  is  because,
    notwithstanding the "fairness" issues to which we were referred,  there
    is nothing inherently unlawful  or  undemocratic  in  the  respondent's
    making of the immigration rules in question.  On this  scenario,  those
    rules would have been approved by Parliament (albeit negatively)  under
    section 3 of the 1971 Act, notwithstanding the effect that they have on
    persons in the position of the appellant.

68.   However, in assessing the proportionality  of  consequent  removal  in
    pursuance of the immigration  decision  (question  5),  we  would  have
    regarded the weight to be given to  the  respondent's  relevant  public
    interest as being reduced to the point where, on the specific facts  of
    this   case,   the   appellant's   interests   outweighed   them.   The
    proportionality of the individual immigration decision appealed has  to
    be determined in the light of the fact that (a) it involves an  element
    of unfairness; (b)  it  concerns  a  necessarily  limited  category  of
    persons; and (c)  accordingly,  the  overturning  of  that  immigration
    decision is not a matter that can properly  be  said  to  undermine  or
    otherwise materially damage public respect  for  the  United  Kingdom's
    system of immigration controls. The strength of the  appellant's  right
    to private and family life outweighs  the  diminished  public  interest
    under Article 8(2).

Decision

69.   The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is  set  aside.   We  re-
    make  the  decision  by  allowing  the  appellant's  appeal  under   the
    immigration rules.


                               Signed        Upper Tribunal Judge Peter
                                   Lane
