                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Kempton, promulgated on 10th March 2016, following a hearing at Glasgow
    on 10th February 2016.  In the determination, the judge  dismissed  the
    appeal of Mr Steve Molina, whereupon the Appellant applied for, and was
    granted, permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  thus  the
    matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of the United States, and  was  born
    6th November 1977.  On 12th October 2015, he made  an  application  for
    leave to remain in the UK with his  wife  on  the  basis  that  he  had
    entered on 23rd May 2013 into the United Kingdom with  entry  clearance
    as a spouse/or partner, until 23rd  November  2015,  and  his  partner,
    Sally Ann Miles, has dual UK and US nationality.

 3. Under the partner route, the Appellant have to show income, of at least
    �18,600, and the Respondent rejected the application on the basis  that
    the eligibility requirements of  paragraph  R-LTRP.1.1(c)(ii)  had  not
    been  satisfied  because  the  Appellant  could  not  meet  the  income
    threshold and the related evidential requirement  for  Appendix  FM-SE.
    This was because first, the wage slips had  not  been  stamped  by  the
    employer and confirmed as genuine.

 4. Second, the Appellant had not provided a bank  statement  for  the  six
    month period prior to  the  date  of  the  application  confirming  his
    earnings.   Third,  there  was  no  employer's  letter  confirming  the
    employment.

 5. By the time of the appeal before Judge Kempton on 10th  February  2016,
    it was noted that first, the wage slips submitted had now been  stamped
    by the employer confirming them as genuine.   Second,  there  were  six
    months' bank statements covering the six  month  period  prior  to  the
    application confirming the income into the account.  Third, there was a
    letter from the employer confirming employment.

 6. Judge Kempton had before him a "paper appeal" in that the parties  were
    unrepresented and the determination had to be made on the basis of  the
    documentation before the Tribunal.  Judge Kempton observed that at  the
    date of the  application  on  12th  October  2015,  the  Appellant  was
    required to produce original payslips verified by the employer for  the
    six month period prior to that date.  This meant the period from  April
    2015 to September 2015.   However,  now  that  the  payslips  had  been
    stamped, (although in some cases twice), the judge  observed  that  the
    payslips provided do cover the appropriate period  in  the  appropriate
    manner (see paragraph 10).

 7. Second, as far as the letter from the employer was concerned, this  was
    dated 3rd December 2015 and it  was  signed  by  the  Director,  Gareth
    Davis, and  he  certified  the  payslips  as  being  true  copies.   He
    confirmed the Appellant had been employed since 22nd  June  2014  on  a
    basic salary of �18,000 but was entitled to  overtime  and  commission.
    His annualised income would be around �20,255.64.  On the face  of  it,
    the employer's letter too met the requirements.

 8. Third, the bank statements had to show that the  various  net  payments
    shown on the payslips being credited to  the  Appellant's  account  are
    available.   The  judge  observed  that,  "These  payslips   and   bank
    statements were all available to the Appellant as at the  date  of  the
    application", and although the Appellant had  not  originally  included
    it, "nevertheless, the information was available as at the date of  the
    application and so I will accept it, as far as it goes" (paragraph 13).
     Finally, as far as the letter from employer was concerned, it  was  in
    simple terms and it  did  not  say  whether  the  Appellant  was  on  a
    permanent or temporary contract but, "There is nothing to suggest  that
    he is anything other than a permanent member of staff" and this too was
    accepted  (paragraph  14).   All-in-all,  therefore,  the   judge   was
    satisfied that the requirements of the Rules had been met  and  allowed
    the appeal.

Grounds of Application

 9. The grounds of application stated that the judge erred  in  considering
    the position at the date of the hearing and not  at  the  date  of  the
    application that all  the  specified  documents  had  to  be  produced.
    Permission to appeal was granted on 25th August 2016.

The Hearing

10. At the hearing before me on 29th September 2016, Mr Bramble,  appearing
    on behalf of the Respondent Secretary  of  State,  submitted  that  the
    employer's letter was fundamentally deficient and  the  requirement  of
    the Rules had not been met.  In the application the Appellant  had  not
    produced an employment letter with  his  application.   The  letter  he
    subsequently submitted did not conform to the grounds of  Appendix  FM-
    SE.  The judge had actually  recognised  (at  paragraph  14)  that  the
    letter did not state if the employment was permanent  or  temporary  or
    fixed term.

11. The judge should not have taken the letter into  account  when  finding
    that the Appellant met the evidential requirements under  Appendix  FM-
    SE.  Second, at paragraph 13 of the determination, the  judge  observed
    that the payslips and bank statements were not provided at the date  of
    the application.  The judge had actually said  that  ignorance  of  the
    requirements was not an excuse.  Accordingly, the appeal ought  not  to
    have been allowed.

12. For his part, the Appellant, appearing in person before this  Tribunal,
    explained that he had printed out the Guidance Notes and  the  Guidance
    but he did not spot the link on the internet indicating what had to  be
    submitted, and even when the payslips and the bank statements had  been
    submitted, the employer's letter had not been submitted.   He  said  he
    would have to accept, as a lay person, there had been  deficiencies  in
    the documentation that had been submitted.

13. However, the directions that had been given  were  that  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal, he should now take with him the necessary evidence that he is
    relying upon, and he was therefore of the view that on this basis,  the
    matter could be reconsidered and the appeal allowed.

14. In reply, Mr Bramble handed up the "Immigration Directorate Instruction
    Family Migration: Appendix FM 1.7A" August 2015.  He submitted that  at
    the  date  of  the  application  the  Appellant  could  not  meet   the
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE.

15. Second, if one looks at the application itself (set out at A19),  there
    is a heading "Meeting the Financial Requirement".  This states that,

         "You must indicate how you meet  the  financial  requirement.   The
         Guidance Notes explain what financial resources you may use and the
         relevant evidence you must submit with  your  application.   ...For
         further  information  on  categories  see  Immigration  Directorate
         Instruction FM 1.7 on our website".

16. The Instruction was clear that the applicant  "must  submit  with  your
    application" the necessary documentation.  The Appellant failed  to  do
    so.

17. If one looked at the "evidential requirements" in the  IND  for  Family
    Migration it  specifically  specified  (at  paragraph  5.3)  that  "The
    following must be provided" and this included,

         "a letter from the employer confirming the employment, gross annual
         salary for such income and the annual salary for such income  after
         income tax and national insurance contributions had been paid,  how
         long the employment has being held,  and  the  type  of  employment
         (permanent, fixed term contract or agency)".

18. Furthermore, the payslips covering the period for six months  prior  to
    the date of the application, had to be submitted.  Mr Bramble submitted
    that there were no six months' payslips.

19. There was no bank statement corresponding  with  that.   There  was  no
    appropriate employer's letter.  Accordingly, the appeal could not  have
    been allowed.

Error of Law

20. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  Judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law  (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCA
    2007)/that I should set aside the decision and remake the decision (see
    section 12(2) of TCA 2007).  My reasons are as follows.

21.  This  is  a  case  where,  by  the  Appellant's  own  admission,   the
    documentation had not been submitted, and where it had been  submitted,
    it had not been submitted in the specified form.  The  application  was
    clear at Section 7A when dealing with "financial requirement", that the
    applicant had to submit information with the application and  attention
    was directed to the Immigration Directorate Instruction  FM  1.7.   The
    failure to do so rendered the application deficient.

22. What Judge Kempton set out to do was to  look  at  ways  in  which  the
    deficient application  could  be  perfected.   This  is  clear  in  the
    statement that, "There is nothing to suggest that he is anything  other
    than a permanent member of staff" (paragraph 14)  but  the  information
    was not provided as required under the Rules.

23. It was not given in the specified form.  Therefore,  the  appeal  could
    not have been allowed.



Remaking the Decision

24. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am dismissing the appeal for the reasons that I have  already
    set out above.

Notice of Decision

25. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside  the
    decision of the original judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as  follows.
    This appeal is dismissed.

26. No anonymity direction is made.
