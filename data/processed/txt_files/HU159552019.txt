For the Appellant:                                Mr  Collins,  of  Counsel,
                    instructed by Mayfairs Law Limited

For  the   Respondent:                                Mr   McVeety,   Senior
Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. The Appellant is a national of Albania born in 1988.  He appeals with
       permission against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  J.
       Watson) to dismiss his human rights appeal.

    2. The basis of the Appellant's claim before the First-tier Tribunal was
       that he is in a genuine and subsisting relationship with his  partner
       in the United  Kingdom,  and  further  that  he  has  a  genuine  and
       subsisting parental relationship with her children.  The  Appellant's
       partner was at the date of the appeal hearing, pregnant.   One of her
       existing children suffers  from  a  disability,  and  she  needs  the
       Appellant's assistance in caring for them.  The  Appellant  submitted
       that  it  would  in  all  the  circumstances  be  a  disproportionate
       interference with his family life, as protected by Article 8 ECHR, to
       refuse him leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

    3. The Respondent refused to grant leave.  Although it was accepted that
       the Appellant is  in  a  relationship  with  his  partner  there  was
       insufficient evidence to demonstrate that he had lived with  her  for
       two years of more (a necessary pre-requisite for qualification  under
       the rules), that he had a parental relationship with the children  or
       that there was any exceptional circumstances such that  leave  should
       be granted 'outside of the rules'. The First-tier Tribunal agreed and
       the appeal was dismissed.

    4. The Appellant now appeals on one ground only:   that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal materially erred in law in its assessment of proportionality
       because it failed to weigh in the balance its  own  recognition  that
       "any future entry clearance application should be successful in terms
       of satisfying Appendix FM" [at paragraph 8 of the grounds]. The point
       made in both Chikwamba v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
       [2008] UKHL 40 and Secretary of State for the Home Department v Hayat
       [2012] EWCA Civ 1054  -  that  it  may  be  pointless  and  therefore
       disproportionate to expect people to travel back to  their  countries
       of origin simply to be let in again - is endorsed in the  context  of
       the 'new rules' in R (on the application  of  Agyarko  and  Ikuga)  v
       Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 11.  Post  the
       grant of permission Mr Collins submitted further submissions in which
       he placed reliance, for the same point, on the Presidential  decision
       in Younas (section 117B(6)(b); Chikwamba; Zambrano) [2020] UKUT 00129
       (IAC).

    5. Whilst I am grateful for Mr Collins' submissions, I am not  satisfied
       that this ground is made out.

    6. First, the grounds rely on an unduly optimistic reading of First-tier
       Tribunal  decision.  The  Tribunal  nowhere  says   that   a   future
       application  for  entry  clearance  "should"  be   successful.   What
       paragraph 36 actually says is this: "she may sponsor him as a fiancï¿½e
       in the future if she wishes". No positive finding is made in  respect
       of the Appellant's English language ability,  a  matter  specifically
       raised in the refusal  letter,  nor  is  any  commentary  offered  on
       whether the Appellant may fall foul of one of the  'general'  grounds
       for refusal in part 9 of the Rules. In fact  the  Tribunal  gives  no
       indication at all that it considered this to  be  a  case  where  the
       Appellant would be granted entry clearance if he so applied.   It  is
       therefore not the case that this  was  an  appeal  which  could  have
       benefitted from any application of the Chikwamba principle.

    7. Second, even if positive findings had been made about the Appellant's
       ability  to  meet  the  requirements  of  an  application  for  entry
       clearance, that was not the end of the matter. Under  the  new  rules
       the relevance of the Chikwamba principles are primarily whether it is
       proportionate to  expect  a  claimant  to  return  home  to  make  an
       application  for  entry  clearance:  Younas  (supra),   R   (on   the
       application of Chen) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department)
       (Appendix FM - Chikwamba - temporary  separation  -  proportionality)
       IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC).   The difficulties that might  be  faced
       by a family because of such temporary  separation  are  matters  that
       should be taken into  account  in  the  overall  balancing  exercise:
       Agyarko (supra).  In this case  the  Tribunal  expressly  found  that
       there was no difficulty at all  in  the  Appellant  returning  for  a
       period to Albania, where he has family. It further found no  evidence
       to show that his sponsor's children would be unduly affected  by  his
       short  absence.   Neither  of  those  findings  of  fact  have   been
       challenged in the grounds. Had this been a  Chikwamba  assessment  Mr
       Collins makes the good point that the sponsor's pregnancy would  have
       been a relevant consideration, but I am far from  satisfied  that  it
       would have been a determinative one.

    8. In these circumstances the grounds have failed to identify any  error
       of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  It  follows  that
       the appeal must be dismissed.

    9. I understand that this does not matter much to the  Appellant,  whose
       partner has now given birth to his British  child,  enabling  him  to
       make a new application for leave to remain on the basis that it would
       not be reasonable to expect that child to leave this country, and  so
       be separated from its  half-siblings  and  mother:   section  117B(6)
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 refers.

  Decisions

   10. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains no error of law
       and it is upheld.

   11. I was not asked to make an order for anonymity and on the facts I see
       no reason to do so.
