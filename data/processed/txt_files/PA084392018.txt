                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Albania born in 1979.  She appeals  with
    permission[1] the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Shergill)
    to dismiss her appeal on protection and human rights grounds.




    Background and Matters in Issue


 2. The Appellant's claim, as set  out  in  her  asylum  interview,  is  as
    follows.  She is a woman from the north of  Albania  who  was  latterly
    living with her three children in Tirana. Her husband was at one time a
    fighter for the Kosovan Liberation Army but he left Albania in 2002  in
    search of work in  western  Europe.  The  Appellant  believes  that  he
    thereafter entered the United Kingdom  to  work  illegally  here.    It
    would seem from the evidence elicited at  interview  that  he  has  not
    returned to Albania to live since that time, although I note that their
    youngest child is aged only 8, so I assume that he must  have  returned
    for at least one visit. The Appellant and her three  children  remained
    in Tirana with her husband's family.  In December  2015  the  Appellant
    and her husband agreed that she and the children  would  leave  Albania
    and try and join her husband in the United Kingdom.


 3. The Appellant and her children  travelled  from  Albania  by  bus  into
    Greece. From there they flew to Belgium. This stage of the journey  was
    completed using their own passports.  The Appellant's husband told  her
    that when she got to Belgium she should meet there with  some  Albanian
    men, whom he had arranged would facilitate the illegal  entry  of  both
    mother and children into the United Kingdom.  The  Appellant  met  with
    these men as planned: they picked her up at the airport.  She  and  the
    children stayed with these men for three days in a hotel and from there
    they were driven to France, where they  were  brought  to  a  house  in
    Calais.   They were given Italian identity documents which  they  tried
    to use to leave France  for  the  United  Kingdom;  they  were  refused
    boarding.  The Appellant and the children tried to get  to  the  United
    Kingdom, and failed, on five occasions.   On each occasion her  husband
    told her that they should just go back to Albania,  but  the  Appellant
    persisted, believing that she  was  unable  to  cope  living  with  two
    teenage children in Albania and that they needed their father.

 4. After the fifth occasion the two men who had been arranging the  travel
    told her that she had run out of money. Her husband had  said  that  he
    would pay for the clandestine arrangement but he now owed them E12,000,
    including the costs of  having  obtained  the  Italian  documents.  The
    Appellant spoke with her husband who was angry and said that she should
    just go home. He said that these men were "bleeding him dry"  and  that
    he would not pay them. He said "you go back to Albania or we are  done.
    I wouldn't want anything else to do with you take the  children  to  my
    parents and clear off". The two men told her that she needed to work to
    pay off the debt. She was  to  work  as  a  prostitute.  The  Appellant
    continued to stay in the house in Calais,  but  each  morning  the  men
    would collect her and drive her somewhere else, where she was compelled
    by threat of violence to undertake sex work. In the evening they  would
    bring her back. She did not  try  to  get  away  because  the  men  had
    threatened her children. Her daughter was 16 at the time and they  said
    that they would get her and put her on the streets. They said that  the
    organs of the younger children would be taken and sold.  The  Appellant
    was very afraid and so did what they asked. After some  weeks  she  and
    the children escaped at night, managed to board a lorry, and got to the
    United Kingdom.

 5. The Competent Authority in the United Kingdom has recognised that there
    are conclusive grounds for believing that the Appellant is a victim  of
    trafficking as she described. In his refusal letter dated the 23rd June
    2018 the Respondent expressly accepts the account  that  the  Appellant
    has given.  Protection was however refused on the  grounds  that  there
    would be a sufficiency of protection available in Albania.

 6. The case for the Appellant, arising from these facts, was that she  had
    a well-founded fear of persecution in Albania either from  traffickers,
    from family, or both. In her interview she explained that  as  a  woman
    who had worked as a prostitute she brought shame upon  her  family  and
    that she would be killed as a result; she feared  both  her  own  natal
    family and her in-laws. She believed  that  they  would  discover  what
    happened to her in Europe because  the  traffickers  would  "spill  the
    beans".  In respect of the risk of trafficking the submission made  was
    that a) there was a risk from the previous traffickers arising from the
    'debt' and/or b) as a single woman estranged from family she  would  be
    vulnerable to predation by other traffickers.

 7. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed  the  appeal  on  all  grounds.   The
    Appellant was granted permission to appeal to this Tribunal on the 29th
    October 2018.


    Error of Law: Discussion and Findings

 8. Following a hearing on the 28th January 2019 I found  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal had erred in its approach such that its decision must  be
    set aside.


 9. The first error, or errors, arise in respect of the findings about  the
    Appellant's family in Albania.  I am satisfied that  the  determination
    is flawed for a lack of clear or reasoned findings on this  key  issue.
    At paragraph 11 the First-tier Tribunal identifies a  "discrepancy"  as
    follows: "I was not persuaded by the bare denial  of  lack  of  contact
    with the appellant's mother contrasted to the recorded answers  to  the
    contrary at Q10 and Q11".   Answers Q10 and Q11 of the asylum interview
    (it must be assumed that this is what  the  Tribunal  here  refers  to)
    state that the Appellant last spoke with her mother on  the  8th  April
    2016. She then stated, at Q12, that she was in danger from her  family;
    she then mentioned her husband but was, according  to  the  transcript,
    unable  to  complete   her   answer   because   she   began   to   "cry
    uncontrollably".  Having had regard to those answers it is not clear to
    me what discrepancy the Tribunal believed itself  to  have  identified.
    The fact that the Appellant may, at a hearing in September  2018,  have
    said that she is not now in contact  with  her  mother  is  in  no  way
    inconsistent with evidence that she had spoken to her some two and half
    years earlier.  This was  the  sole  reason  given  for  rejecting  the
    evidence that the Appellant can  no  longer  turn  to  her  family  for
    support.


10. I am further satisfied that the Tribunal failed to properly conduct  an
    assessment of the risk of harm from the Appellant's family.  It was her
    evidence at interview that she  now  fears  her  family.  Although  not
    expressed in this way, the clear inference is that she  fears  "honour"
    based violence: she directly refers to the "shame" she has brought upon
    her "whole clan".    The First-tier Tribunal dealt with that fear in  a
    single line at its paragraph 13: "I am not satisfied that the family is
    aware of what happened in France".    I  am  not  satisfied  that  this
    constitutes a holistic risk assessment. First because it  assumes  that
    the Appellant would and should continue  to  conceal  from  her  entire
    family the trauma that she has experienced since she saw them last:  it
    is at least arguable that this offends the principle in HJ  (Iran)  and
    HT (Cameroon) [2010] UKSC 31. Second because the bald conclusion is not
    underpinned by any analysis of the evidence. The chain of communication
    between the traffickers (who had expressly  threatened  to  reveal  her
    history) and her family was not particularly tenuous.  The  traffickers
    know the Appellant's husband. They claim that he owes them in excess of
    E12,000, and in those circumstances it  might  be  expected  that  they
    would retain contact with him.  Her husband remains in contact with his
    family. His family remain in contact with her  own.    It  is  entirely
    possible, given that chain of communication, that the Appellant's fears
    would be realised and her "shame" would become known to her  family  in
    Albania, a family who originate from a small town in the North.    That
    was a fear that merited closer scrutiny than it received.


11. The  second  error,  or  errors,  arise  in  respect  of  the  risk  of
    trafficking. The determination repeatedly  refers  to  the  Appellant's
    account as being  "atypical".   At,  for  instance,  paragraph  11  the
    determination reads "A strict application of the country guidance might
    eject this case from the sphere of  asylum  altogether.  The  appellant
    happens to be Albanian and someone who was trafficked for prostitution.
    The factual nexus  between  the  nationality  and  the  events  is  not
    consistent with the case law  in  this  area".  The  remainder  of  the
    paragraph goes on to explain that the trafficking took place in France,
    "far away from Albania". I am at a loss to understand what  this  self-
    direction meant.    The fact that the  sexual  exploitation  only  took
    place outside of Albania does  not  make  this  case  "atypical".  Many
    thousands of Albanian women have found themselves in similar situations
    only once outside their country of origin: see TD  and  AD  (trafficked
    women) Albania CG [2016] UKUT  00092  (IAC).  Nor  could  it  be  said,
    contrary to the First-tier Tribunal suggestion  at  its  paragraph  16,
    that  the  Appellant's  age   rendered   her   trafficking   experience
    "atypical": as the Upper Tribunal emphasise in TD and AD,  "it  is  not
    possible to set out a typical profile of trafficked women from Albania:
    trafficked women come from all areas of the  country  and  from  varied
    social backgrounds".  It was the Tribunal's mischaracterisation of this
    case as "atypical" which underpinned its risk assessment.

12. Whilst the First-tier Tribunal does identify various protective factors
    which might be said  to  diminish  the  risk  (ie  she  does  not  have
    illegitimate children) I am not satisfied that the  overall  assessment
    is safe. There is, crucially, no consideration given to the uncontested
    evidence that the traffickers have calculated the Appellant's "debt" to
    them at E12,000.   Given that  these  traffickers  were  Albanian,  and
    known to the Appellant's family (or at least her husband)  the  failure
    to consider the possibility that they  would  want  their  money  -  or
    payment in kind - should she come to their attention in Albania appears
    to be an obvious omission.  Nor, fundamentally, does the  determination
    recognise that the only matter in issue arising from the  Secretary  of
    State's  refusal  decision  was  whether  the  Appellant  could   avoid
    persecution by internally relocating and/or  availing  herself  of  the
    protection of the Albanian state.



    The Evidence

13. Following the 'error of law' hearing I directed that the Appellant  was
    to file and serve an up to date witness report no later  than  the  1st
    March 2019.  The matter was thereafter listed for hearing on  the  20th
    May 2019 but that hearing was vacated at the request of the Appellant's
    counsel because he was not available on that date.  It is not clear why
    the matter could not be relisted sooner, but that is something  that  I
    am looking into.  It is a matter of extreme regret that  the  Appellant
    has had to wait nine months for the resolution of  her  appeal  in  the
    Upper Tribunal.


14. The Appellant's updated witness statement is dated 18th February  2019.
    She confirms the matters I have summarised at �2-6 above.  She has  had
    no further contact with her family. She is on anti-depressants, and  is
    suffering  from  flashbacks,  nightmares  and  panic  attacks.  She  is
    receiving weekly counselling from an organisation called the 'Rape  and
    Sexual Abuse Centre'.  She continues to be in fear of her  husband  and
    his family, whom she  fears  will  seek  retribution  against  her  for
    'shaming' them and taking the children away. The children are now  aged
    19 (a girl who is studying), 17 (a boy who is studying) and 8  (a  girl
    in primary school).  The Appellant herself is now aged 39. She does not
    believe that she would be able  to  support  her  children  in  Albania
    because she has very limited work experience and no  qualifications  to
    speak of.  She did work  between  2012  and  2014  in  a  shop  selling
    blankets, but her boss was a  friend  of  her  husband's  family.   The
    Appellant remains in fear of those who trafficked her. As far  as  they
    are concerned the family still owes them a substantial amount of  money
    and she is terrified that they  would  turn  their  attentions  to  her
    eldest daughter. Without any male relatives to support and protect them
    the Appellant - and her daughter  -  would  remain  vulnerable  to  re-
    trafficking by that gang.


15. The Appellant's assertions that she continues to receive  psychological
    support in the United Kingdom are corroborated by correspondence  dated
    2017-2019 from 'RASA Merseyside' (Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre).   RASA
    confirm that the Appellant has been attending the  centre  for  support
    and regular counselling since January 2017, having initially  presented
    in an "extremely distressed and confused state".    The  Appellant  has
    consistently  described  to  her   counsellor   feeling   "dirty"   and
    overwhelmed by guilt and shame. She has however  worked  constructively
    with support workers and counsellors to deal with these problems.   She
    visits the centre regularly and describes herself as being  emotionally
    dependent on its support. The hearing was also attended by a Ms  Mischa
    MacAskill, a support worker with 'City Hearts'. Ms MacAskill  explained
    that the Appellant was referred directly to their organisation  by  the
    NRM: they are a charity sub-contracted by the Salvation Army (who  hold
    the main contract for this work) to support victims of  modern  slavery
    in their recovery.   A letter from City Hearts explained that  part  of
    their work is to signpost other services for victims of trafficking and
    to work to reduce their vulnerabilities to re-trafficking.  In the case
    of the Appellant that has involved working closely with her  to  assist
    her with practical matters such as secure accommodation,  but  also  in
    facilitating her mental recovery through referrals to  groups  such  as
    RASA.  The Appellant comes to City Hearts' weekly drop in  and  engages
    in further support by telephone.

16. The Appellant relies on  a  psychiatric  report  prepared  by  a  Dr  J
    Hajioff, consultant in psychiatry.  No issue is taken with Dr Hajioff's
    expertise but it is worth noting that he has been employed by the  Home
    Office for fifteen  years.   Dr  Hajioff  met  with  the  Appellant  in
    February for the purpose of prepared this report, but also  had  regard
    to her medical history and the pleadings in this appeal.    Dr  Hajioff
    records the Appellant's history. I need not set out his summary save to
    note that what she told him is consistent with what she  has  told  the
    Home Office, the Competent Authority and this Tribunal.  She  exhibited
    signs of distress  at  times  during  the  consultation,  notably  when
    communicating her fears for her 19 year old daughter.   In terms of her
    mental health she told Dr Hajioff that she  continues  to  suffer  from
    fear and anxiety, and regularly wakes in  the  night  with  nightmares.
    Although the house where her  and  her  children  live  is  secure  the
    Appellant bolts the door and jams a chair against it when they are  all
    safely inside.   She finds it difficult to enjoy things  that  she  did
    before her trafficking experience.  When she is out of  the  house  she
    "sees" her former traffickers looking for her and she  is  startled  by
    loud noises.   On the basis of this information,  and  the  Appellant's
    medical history, Dr Hajioff is satisfied that  she  is  suffering  from
    Post-Traumatic  Stress  Disorder,  anxiety  and  depression.   Although
    nothing turns on it Dr Hajioff further records that the Appellant bears
    physical scars consistent with her account, for instance a scar to  her
    forehead caused when she was punched in the face by  a  man  wearing  a
    ring; her hands have scars typical of defence injuries.




    The Re-Made Decision


17. The Respondent accepts that the Appellant is a victim  of  trafficking,
    and that her narrative of sexual exploitation and violence at the hands
    of a trafficking gang is true. No issue is taken with  her  claim  that
    this gang considers that she/her husband owe them a considerable amount
    of money.


18. The Respondent further accepts that the Appellant would  face  a  well-
    founded fear of persecution in her area of origin in  Northern  Albania
    for reasons of her membership of a particular social group. This  would
    appear to be in recognition of the fact  that  a  woman  from  Northern
    Albania who is considered by her community to  be  a  kurva  will  face
    serious harm if she attempts to reintegrate in that community.

19. The only issue before me is therefore internal flight, and whether  the
    Albanian state would in practice offer the Appellant and her children a
    sufficiency of protection in Tirana. The applicable guidance  is  found
    in TD and AD (Trafficked women) CG [2016] UKUT 00092 (IAC):



         Much of the guidance given in AM & BM (Trafficked women) Albania CG
         [2010] UKUT 00080 (IAC) is maintained. Where that guidance has been
         amended or supplemented by this decision it has been highlighted in
         bold:



    "a)    It is not possible to set out a typical  profile  of  trafficked
         women from Albania:  trafficked women come from all  areas  of  the
         country and from varied social backgrounds.


    b)     Much of Albanian society is governed by a strict code of  honour
         which  not  only  means  that  trafficked  women  would  have  very
         considerable difficulty in reintegrating into their home  areas  on
         return but also will affect their ability to  relocate  internally.
         Those  who  have  children  outside   marriage   are   particularly
         vulnerable.  In extreme cases the close relatives of the trafficked
         woman may refuse to have the trafficked woman's child  return  with
         her and could force her to abandon the child.


    c)     Some women are lured to leave Albania  with  false  promises  of
         relationships or work. Others may seek out traffickers in order  to
         facilitate their departure from Albania and their establishment  in
         prostitution abroad. Although such women cannot  be  said  to  have
         left Albania against their will, where they have fallen  under  the
         control of traffickers for the purpose  of  exploitation  there  is
         likely to be considerable violence within the relationships  and  a
         lack of freedom: such women are victims of trafficking.


    d)      In  the  past  few  years  the  Albanian  government  has  made
         significant efforts to improve its response  to  trafficking.  This
         includes widening the scope of legislation, publishing the Standard
         Operating Procedures, implementing an effective  National  Referral
         Mechanism, appointing  a  new  Anti-trafficking  Co-ordinator,  and
         providing training to  law  enforcement  officials.   There  is  in
         general a Horvath-standard sufficiency of protection, but  it  will
         not be effective in every case.  When considering  whether  or  not
         there is a sufficiency of protection for a  victim  of  trafficking
         her particular circumstances must be considered.


    e)     There is now in place a reception  and  reintegration  programme
         for victims of trafficking. Returning victims  of  trafficking  are
         able to stay in a shelter on arrival, and in 'heavy cases'  may  be
         able to stay there for up to 2 years. During  this  initial  period
         after return victims of trafficking are  supported  and  protected.
         Unless  the  individual  has  particular  vulnerabilities  such  as
         physical or mental health issues, this option cannot  generally  be
         said to be unreasonable; whether it is must be determined on a case
         by case basis.


    f)     Once asked to leave the shelter a victim of trafficking can live
         on her own. In  doing  so  she  will  face  significant  challenges
         including,  but  not  limited  to,  stigma,  isolation,   financial
         hardship and uncertainty, a sense of physical  insecurity  and  the
         subjective fear of being found either by their families  or  former
         traffickers.  Some women will have the capacity to negotiate  these
         challenges without undue hardship. There will however be victims of
         trafficking  with  characteristics,  such  as  mental  illness   or
         psychological  scarring,   for   whom   living   alone   in   these
         circumstances  would  not  be  reasonable.   Whether  a  particular
         appellant  falls  into  that  category  will  call  for  a  careful
         assessment of all the circumstances.


    g)     Re-trafficking is a reality. Whether that  risk  exists  for  an
         individual claimant will turn in part on the factors  that  led  to
         the  initial  trafficking,  and  on  her  personal   circumstances,
         including her background, age, and her willingness and  ability  to
         seek help from the authorities. For  a  proportion  of  victims  of
         trafficking, their situations may mean  that  they  are  especially
         vulnerable  to  re-trafficking,  or   being   forced   into   other
         exploitative situations.


    h)      Trafficked  women  from  Albania  may  well  be  members  of  a
         particular social group on that account alone. Whether they are  at
         risk of persecution on account of such membership and whether  they
         will  be  able  to  access  sufficiency  of  protection  from   the
         authorities  will  depend  upon  their   individual   circumstances
         including but not limited to the following:


                    1) The social status and economic standing of her family


                    2) The level of education of the victim  of  trafficking
                       or her family
                    3)  The  victim  of  trafficking's  state   of   health,
                       particularly her mental health
                    4) The presence of an illegitimate child
                    5) The area of origin
                    6) Age
                    7) What support network will be available.


20. Applying that guidance I find that there is, in general, a  sufficiency
    of protection in Albania. I am further  satisfied  that  it  cannot  in
    general be said  to  be  unduly  harsh  to  expect  former  victims  of
    trafficking to return to Tirana where they will receive some protection
    and support from the Albanian government  in  the  form  of  short-term
    access to shelters, financial support and  training  opportunities.  Mr
    Collins accepted that this was, in general, the position. The  question
    is whether there are any particular features of this  case  which  mean
    that the Appellant would not be so protected.


21. I begin by considering the practical obstacles that the  Appellant  and
    her children might face upon return to Tirana.

22. First, I am satisfied that the Appellant  cannot  turn  to  any  family
    members for support.  Although the First-tier Tribunal had found,  with
    little reasoning (see above), that the  Appellant  could  look  to  her
    family for help, Mr McVeety acknowledged that this proposition finds no
    support  in  the  actual  evidence.  The  Appellant  has   consistently
    described  her  northern   Albanian   father   as   'traditional'   and
    'domineering' and has been seen by at least two  independent  observers
    (an immigration officer and Dr Hajioff) to  become  visibly  distressed
    when discussing her relationship with her family.  I am satisfied  that
    as a northern  Albanian  woman  from  a  traditional  family,  who  has
    'abandoned' her husband, the Appellant is not going to receive support,
    either financial or emotional, from her family. The cultural and social
    context is such that she will be perceived to have brought  'shame'  on
    them by her actions of disobeying her husband.

23. Mr McVeety was unable to point to any  evidence  to  suggest  that  the
    Appellant would be admitted to one of the government-funded shelters in
    Tirana with her 19 year old, 17 year old and 8  year  old  children  in
    tow.  There would be particular difficulties in having the 17 year  old
    boy admitted. On the evidence before the Tribunal in TD  and  AD,  this
    would simply not be possible.   It may be that the  Appellant  and  her
    youngest child could be admitted, but that would be  at  the  price  of
    leaving her elder children to fend for themselves.  Mr McVeety did  not
    attempt to argue that such an interference with this family life  would
    be a 'reasonable'  means  of  the  Appellant  availing  herself  of  an
    internal flight alternative.

24. The Appellant has no education or qualifications to speak of. Her  only
    work experience - as a shop assistant  - was  obtained  through  family
    connections.  I bear in mind however that she will be entitled to  some
    financial support from the Albanian government, and that  she  and  the
    children would be entitled, on paper at least, to  social  housing.   I
    also bear in mind that the two elder children could work to  supplement
    the household income.

25. In TD and AD the Upper Tribunal held that women trying to live on their
    own in these circumstances faced, at the very least, stigma, isolation,
    financial hardship and uncertainty. I am satisfied, having  had  regard
    to the  extensive  evidence  before  me  relating  to  the  Appellant's
    precarious mental health, that  she  has  neither  the  resilience  nor
    capacity to deal with those challenges.  The evidence demonstrates that
    she is heavily dependent upon the support networks that she  has  here,
    including the help offered to her by RASA and City Hearts. I cannot  be
    satisfied, on the evidence before  me,  at  any  of  the  psychological
    support that she may be able to access in Tirana would be of comparable
    quality. I say that  not  just  because  the  Appellant  has  built  up
    personal relationships with women in these organisations over the  past
    two and half  years,  nor  because  of  deficiencies  in  the  Albanian
    provision: the most significant  factor  underpinning  the  Appellant's
    recovery is the fact that in this country she is  able  to  feel  -  at
    least sometimes - safe.

26. The same simply cannot be said for Tirana. Her hostile husband and  his
    family live in Kamez, a suburb of the city. The men who trafficked her,
    and to whom she still 'owes' E12,000, are from the same area. I have no
    reason to doubt that the  Appellant  is  absolutely  terrified  at  the
    prospect of living less than eight miles away from those  threats.  Nor
    do I doubt that the greater part of that fear comes from the fact  that
    her daughter is now 19 and herself a potential victim of that gang  who
    did, after all, threaten to 'put her on the streets' when she was  only
    16 (see my �4 above).

27. The Appellant then faces a challenge wherever she is in Albania. If she
    returns to her home village in the North she faces what  the  Secretary
    of State appears to have accepted to be a real  risk  of  honour  based
    violence, rejection and shaming by her natal family. If she chooses  to
    try and establish herself in Tirana, she will be  a  matter  of  a  few
    miles away from the hostility of her husband and his family,  who  have
    rejected her - but may demand the 'return' of his children. There is in
    my view a reasonable likelihood that the Appellant's husband  has  come
    to know about her trafficking experience, thus heightening the risk  of
    actual violence from his household. More significantly I  am  extremely
    concerned that the  traffickers,  should  they  become  aware  of  this
    family's return to Albania, will seek to recoup their 'losses',  either
    by means of violent retribution, the exploitation of the  Appellant  or
    her teenage daughter.

28. Mr McVeety fairly pointed out that the Appellant and her children  have
    formerly lived 'alone' - that is to say in their own accommodation - in
    Tirana.   That is true. That was however at a time when the Appellant's
    circumstances were very different. She was living in close proximity to
    her in-laws, and was  then  considered  part  of  their  family.    Her
    husband was  away  working  -  she  was  therefore  considered  by  her
    community to be a married -  'decent'  -  woman.    She  had  not  been
    through the extreme mental trauma of her trafficking experience. It  is
    not now possible for the Appellant to re-set the clock. She is  a  very
    different woman today.

29. Having taken all of these factors into account I am satisfied,  on  the
    lower standard of proof, that there would be a real risk of harm to the
    Appellant and her children should they try and re-establish their lives
    in Tirana. The fact that the trafficking 'debt' remains outstanding  is
    a real concern, and considerably heightens  the  likelihood  that  this
    Appellant will be re-targeted.  If I am wrong I  am  satisfied,  having
    regard to the Appellant's poor mental  health,  that  her  appeal  must
    nevertheless succeed because it would be unduly harsh to expect her  to
    try and live in Tirana, where she has no  support,  no  connections  to
    whom she could turn, no qualifications or meaningful  work  experience,
    and responsibility for three children.
