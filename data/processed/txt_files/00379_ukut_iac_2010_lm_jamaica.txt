For the Appellant:       Mrs K Afolabi of Messrs Gramyko Amedu
For the Respondent:    Ms D Cantrell, Home Office Presenting Officer.


It was not a violation of Article 8 ECHR to remove the appellant to  Jamaica
given that she married her BOT citizen husband from Montserrat when she  was
here without leave, substantially failed  to  comply  with  the  Immigration
Rules, had no UK born children and strong  family  connections  in  Jamaica,
including three children one still  a  minor.  Despite  the  fact  that  the
settled  husband  was  in  receipt  of  invalidity  benefit  here,  it   was
reasonable to expect him to follow the appellant to Jamaica.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

1. We are concerned to determine whether Article 8 ECHR  requires  the  SSHD
   to allow the appellant to remain in the United  Kingdom.  The  procedural
   circumstances in which the matter  comes  before  us  are  these.  On  14
   October 2008 the SSHD refused the appellant leave to remain in the United
   Kingdom as the spouse of Paul Meade. She  is  a  Jamaican  national.  Her
   appeal against that decision came before  Immigration  Judge  Alis  on  7
   April 2009. It was accepted on behalf of the appellant that she  did  not
   qualify for leave under Paragraph 284 of the Rules (HC 395)  and  so  her
   appeal was limited to a claim under  Article  8.  The  Immigration  Judge
   dismissed the appeal. Blake J ordered reconsideration. In a determination
   dated 29 December 2009 Senior Immigration Judge Gill concluded that there
   had been an error of law in the original determination and adjourned  the
   case for a second stage reconsideration of the Article 8 claim, with  all
   matters at large. In giving her reasons she said:


           "1.    This is the first stage  of  the  reconsideration  of  the
           appeal of the Appellant,  a  national  of  Jamaica.  Her  appeal
           against the Respondent's decision of 6  February  2009  to  give
           directions for her removal from the United Kingdom was dismissed
           on  immigration  grounds  and  on  human   rights   grounds   by
           Immigration Judge Alis following a hearing on 7 April 2009.


              2.  At the first-stage of the reconsideration  on  9  November
           2009,  Mr.  P.  E.  Anyakudo,  of  Gramyko   Amedu   Solicitors,
           represented the Appellant. Ms. D. Cantrell, Senior  Home  Office
           Presenting Officer, represented the Respondent.


              3.  It was accepted  on  the  Appellant's  behalf  before  the
           Immigration Judge and before  me  that  the  Appellant's  appeal
           under the Immigration Rules could not succeed. This  is  because
           the Appellant does not satisfy  the  requirements  of  paragraph
           284(i) of the Immigration Rules. The  Appellant  does  not  have
           limited leave to remain in the United Kingdom. She  was  granted
           leave to enter as a visitor on 26 December 2001 for six  months.
           Her leave expired on 26 June 2002.


              4.  The sole issue before the Immigration  Judge  was  whether
           the Appellant's removal would be in breach of Article 8  of  the
           ECHR. He concluded that it would not. The sole issue  before  me
           is whether the Immigration Judge has materially erred in law  in
           reaching his conclusion on that issue.


             5.   Mr. Anyakudo informed me that  he  was  seeking  a  second
           stage of the reconsideration of the Appellant's Article 8 claim.
           Ms. Cantrell agreed that the Immigration  Judge  did  materially
           err in law in reaching his decision on the Appellant's Article 8
           claim and that the appropriate  course  of  action  is  for  the
           Article 8 claim to be reconsidered on the merits.


             6.   I am satisfied that the Immigration Judge  did  materially
           err in law in reaching his decision on the Appellant's Article 8
           claim. I will now explain my reasons:


            (a)   It is clear from paragraphs 7 and 13 of the refusal letter
                 that the Respondent accepted that the Appellant  had  shown
                 that she and her husband had a subsisting marriage  in  the
                 year 2008. Although the Immigration Judge referred  to  the
                 Respondent's concession at paragraphs 17, 30 and 33 of  the
                 determination, he did not consider it in his assessment  of
                 the evidence at paragraph 44  of  the  determination.  This
                 means that he failed to  apply  an  applicable  concession,
                 which was an error of law.  The fact  that  the  Respondent
                 accepted  that  the  Appellant  and  her  husband   had   a
                 subsisting marriage for the year 2008 was capable of having
                 some bearing on the question whether they had a  subsisting
                 marriage before  2008  and  after  2008.  Accordingly,  the
                 Immigration Judge's error was material to his finding  that
                 he was not  satisfied  that  the  marriage  was  subsisting
                 (paragraph 46 of the determination).


            (b)   The  Immigration  Judge  misdirected  himself  as  to  the
                 applicable standard of proof  in  human  rights  cases.  He
                 directed  himself  at  paragraph  5  that  the  appropriate
                 standard of proof was the balance of  probabilities,  which
                 is wrong. The appropriate standard of proof is the same low
                 standard as applies to asylum cases. Paragraph  46  of  the
                 determination shows that he made his  findings  as  to  the
                 relationship between the Appellant and her husband  on  the
                 standard of the balance of probabilities. This error is  an
                 error of law, which, taken on its own, is material.


            (c)   The Immigration Judge failed to assess the  oral  evidence
                 before him. Although he  recorded  the  oral  evidence,  he
                 failed to assess it. This means that he overlooked relevant
                 evidence.


             7.   The errors of law described at  paragraphs  6(a)  and  (b)
           above are clearly material. I agree that  the  Article  8  claim
           must be reconsidered on the merits.


             8.   I then heard submissions from the parties as to the extent
           of the concession made by the Respondent in the refusal  letter.
           Ms. Cantrell submitted that it is clear, from paragraphs  7  and
           13 of the refusal letter, that the Respondent's  concession  was
           limited to the year 2008. Mr.  Anyakudo  submitted  that,  given
           that the refusal letter is dated 2 February 2009  and  that  the
           Respondent did not dispute that the Appellant  did  not  have  a
           subsisting  relationship  with  her  husband  after  2008,   the
           concession extends beyond the year 2008 to subsequent periods. I
           reserved my decision on this issue.


              9.    In  my  judgment,   Mr.   Anyakudo's   submissions   are
           misconceived. I have noted that Blake J stated, at  paragraph  1
           of  the  decision  ordering  the  Tribunal  to  reconsider   its
           decision, that "the HO accepted that the parties lived  together
           as man and wife in 2008 and  thereafter".  However,  it  is  not
           clear whether Blake J had a copy of the  refusal  letter  before
           him. I have had the benefit of considering the  refusal  letter.
           There was no presenting officer before  the  Immigration  Judge,
           which means a further concession could not have been made on the
           Respondent's behalf at the hearing before the Immigration Judge.
           Mr. Anyakudo submitted that it is possible that  the  Respondent
           served written submissions in which it  was  accepted  that  the
           concession extended to the period after 2008. I have checked the
           documents on file. No written submissions  were  served  on  the
           Respondent's behalf. Accordingly, any concessions  made  on  the
           Respondent's  behalf  must  be  found  in  the  refusal  letter.
           Concessions made on the  Respondent's  behalf  must  be  clearly
           stated. Paragraphs 7 and 13 of the refusal letter clearly relate
           only to the year 2008. They do  not  relate  to  any  subsequent
           period, nor can they reasonably be inferred  to  relate  to  any
           subsequent  periods.  This  is  especially  so  given  that  the
           documentary evidence submitted by the Appellant did  not  extend
           to any period after the year 2008.


            10.     Accordingly,  I  have  decided  that  the   Respondent's
           concession only applies to the year 2008. That is the basis upon
           which the second-stage reconsideration should proceed.


            11.   This case  is  adjourned  part-heard  for  a  second-stage
           reconsideration of the Appellant's Article 8 claim on the merits
           by an Immigration Judge other than Immigration Judge Alis.  None
           of the Immigration Judge's findings shall stand".

2.    By virtue of Paragraph 4 of Schedule 4 to the  Transfer  of  Functions
    of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal Order 2010, the  reconsideration
    now takes place as an appeal to this Tribunal.

The Issues

3.    The SSHD rejected the original application on 2 February  2009  for  a
    number of reasons. Amongst them was that  the  evidence  suggested  the
    existence of a subsisting marriage in 2008 alone, but not from 2003  as
    claimed.  He was not satisfied that the appellant and her  husband  had
    been living  together  permanently  or  that  the  marriage  was  still
    subsisting. This remains the SSHD's contention and a primary foundation
    for his argument  that  Article  8  cannot  avail  this  appellant.  By
    contrast, the appellant and her husband suggest that the marriage is  a
    genuine and subsisting one.  Were the appellant required to  return  to
    Jamaica it would not be reasonable to expect him  to  follow  her.  The
    marriage  might  well  be  destroyed.  The  appellant's  removal  would
    interfere with the Article 8 rights of both parties to the marriage and
    would be disproportionate.

The evidence on the quality of the marriage

4.    We  deal  first  with  evidence  touching  the  question  whether  the
    appellant and her husband are parties to a subsisting marriage with the
    intention of living permanently together. Both gave oral  evidence  and
    confirmed the truth  of  statements  they  made  in  February  2010  in
    preparation for this hearing. In addition they confirmed the statements
    they had made in April 2009 for  the  hearing  before  the  Immigration
    Judge and the content of a questionnaire completed at  their  direction
    by their solicitor in January 2009, which was signed by  them  both.  A
    large number of documents were produced before  the  Immigration  Judge
    and before us which show that both the appellant and her husband  lived
    at 19, Whitstable House, Silchester  Road,  London  W10  6SB  from  the
    summer of 2004. None before 2008 identified them as a couple.  It  was,
    in part, for that reason that the SSHD was  sceptical  about  the  true
    nature of the relationship.

5.    A genuine Marriage Certificate was produced  by  the  appellant  which
    shows that she married Paul Meade on 5 December 2003. The evidence they
    gave of where Mr Meade lived at the time was not  entirely  consistent.
    The Marriage Certificate suggests  that  they  lived  together  at  10,
    Castlebar Road, Ealing at the time of the marriage. The appellant  told
    us that her husband was living with his brother at that time, whilst Mr
    Meade told us that he was living in a hostel, having earlier lived with
    his brother. Mr Meade suffers from  various  medical  difficulties,  to
    which it will be necessary to  return,  and  explained  that  his  wife
    assumed a caring role whilst he was in the hostel. He took a  lease  of
    the flat at Whitstable House from 2 August 2004. It was then that  they
    began to live together. Each, independently and without prompting, gave
    a consistent description of the size of the flat and  its  position  in
    the block. The documents produced (utility, TV services, medical  etc.)
    show to our mind that both have, at the least, been using that  address
    for correspondence purposes. Having heard both the  appellant  and  her
    husband we are satisfied that they are both living in the flat and have
    been doing so since the summer of 2004. We are also satisfied that they
    are living there as man and wife.

6.    There were a number of occasions during the appellant's oral  evidence
    when  we  considered  that  she  was  being  transparently  honest   in
    describing her relationship with her husband.  Examples  occurred  when
    she was being asked by Ms Cantrell to explain what her husband did  all
    day, what his favourite television programmes were and who his  closest
    male friend was. It was  obvious  from  the  appellant's  reaction  and
    demeanour when describing his tendency to  watch  television  all  day,
    with a penchant for horror films and news programmes that the appellant
    did not share his tastes and she thought he  watched  horror  films  in
    part to scare her.  Equally, when telling us that his best  friend  was
    'Junior' she did so in a way we found convincing.  Mr  Meade  confirmed
    the strength of the relationship in less demonstrative terms  than  his
    wife. We do not overlook the paucity of independent evidence  attesting
    to the strength of the marriage  or  of  joint  activities  during  its
    currency, although the  appellant's  Aunt,  Barbara  Jones,  gave  some
    supporting evidence. Nonetheless, we conclude that  the  appellant  and
    her husband are parties to a genuine and subsisting marriage and intend
    to remain together.

The further evidence relevant to the Article 8 claim

7.    There is a great deal of background evidence in  this  case  which  is
    not in dispute. As we have already noted, the appellant is  a  Jamaican
    national. She was born on 13 June  1964.  She  arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom on 26 December 2001 and was granted leave to enter as a visitor
    for six months. She  overstayed.  On  1  December  2004  the  appellant
    submitted her first application for leave to remain as a spouse. It was
    rejected on 10 December. A  second  application  was  submitted  on  17
    December but this too was rejected because the necessary  fee  was  not
    enclosed. On 7 January 2005 she submitted an application for  leave  to
    remain as the spouse of Paul Meade which was technically in  order.  In
    January 2008 she was arrested following a  domestic  disturbance.  Both
    she and her husband speak of that in their statements.  He  had  called
    the police after a domestic dispute. The appellant explained  that  she
    was arrested. The dispute arose out of his drinking, which they say has
    now stopped. At all events the appellant's lack of  immigration  status
    was picked up and an enforcement notice was served  giving  her  notice
    that she was liable to be removed. No action was taken at that time. In
    October 2008 the appellant contacted her Member of Parliament. She  got
    in touch with the Home Office. On 8 December 2008  UKBA  wrote  to  the
    Member of Parliament apologising for the  delay  in  dealing  with  the
    application and indicating that it was being assigned to a case worker.

8.    It was as a result of that action that a  detailed  questionnaire  was
    sent to the appellants' legal representatives on 12 December 2008 which
    was completed by the solicitor in the presence of the appellant and her
    husband (as the appellant told us) and signed by both of them.

9.    The refusal letter followed on 2 February 2009.

10.   Paul Meade is a British Overseas Territories Citizen from  the  Colony
    of Montserrat born on 29 July 1956.  He was given indefinite  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom on 19 September 2001. His  passport  shows
    that he entered Canada on 11 June 2006, although he told us that he had
    not left the United Kingdom since being granted ILR.

11.   Mr Meade labours under a number of health difficulties.  The  evidence
    placed before us is spartan.  He and his wife spoke of  varicose  veins
    and back problems which,  we  infer  from  their  description,  include
    disabling sciatica. The appellant  told  us  that  he  had  been  given
    epidural injections. The objective evidence  includes  a  note  of  the
    decision of the Social Security  Chamber  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dated 26 January 2010 which determined that Mr Meade  was  entitled  to
    the care component of disability living allowance at the 'lowest  rate'
    and the mobility  component  at  the  'higher  rate'.  The  very  short
    decision noted that Mr Meade was 'virtually unable  to  walk'.  Happily
    that was not the position we observed as he walked in and  out  of  the
    hearing room. A recent request by Mr Meade's GP for a routine  chest  X
    ray was included in the appellant's  bundle.   The  request  refers  to
    breathlessness  (not  something  mentioned  to  us  in  evidence)   but
    unfortunately the result was not produced. There is no  recent  medical
    report detailing Mr Meade's problems. All that  was  produced  was  the
    first page of a letter dated 7 May 2009 to his GP from someone  at  the
    Department of Anaesthesia, Intensive Care and Pain  Management  at  the
    Chelsea and Westminster  Hospital.  The  first  paragraph  records  the
    complaints:

            "Thank you ... for referring Paul Meade ...  for  consideration
           of management of his lower back  pain,  which  he  has  had  for
           approximately 30 years. This has  been  gradually  deteriorating
           and over the past few years has been very  significant.  He  has
           been unable to work for the past 10 years because  of  pain  ...
           The pain itself is worst in the legs associated with  occasional
           cramps in his calves and feet and also a burning sensation.  The
           pain stems from the back, which is significant [and]  associated
           with stiffness in the morning; however, the  pain  is  worse  on
           walking, climbing stairs, and lifting. In the morning sometimes,
           he needs massage of his back and legs to try to help loosen them
           from his wife."

      We inquired of Mrs Afolabi whether the second page of the  letter  was
    available, but alas she was unable to find it amongst her  files.  That
    is a pity because it would, no doubt, have indicated  a  diagnosis  and
    treatment plan an identified its author. The first page noted  that  he
    took paracetamol and that physiotherapy and swimming helped a bit,  but
    that exercising produced 'no great effect' and co-codamol did not  help
    either.

12.   Both the appellant and her husband provided details of  immediate  and
    extended family in the questionnaire completed in January  2009.  Prior
    to coming to the United Kingdom Mr Meade lived in Antigua. He has three
    brothers and three sisters in the United Kingdom, one sister in  Canada
    and one in the United States. The  presence  of  his  siblings  in  the
    United Kingdom was not mentioned by the appellant  or  her  husband  as
    being relevant to the Article 8 claim. Indeed the only mention  was  to
    say that his siblings would not be able to  provide  the  care  for  Mr
    Meade that the appellant does, if she were to leave. He has five  adult
    children in Antigua. The appellant has  four  aunts,  two  sisters  and
    'about' 18 cousins in the United Kingdom. We heard from  one  of  those
    Aunts, Barbara Jones, who is obviously close to the appellant  and  has
    been providing her with financial support  since  she  arrived  in  the
    United Kingdom. The material before us shows that the appellant has  an
    involvement in her local Church.  She  also  undertook  some  voluntary
    work, but quite when she was unable to remember, and its nature was not
    explained. A document suggested that she was working voluntarily  part-
    time for the Blue Apple Group in Education and Training  from  November
    2006 to at least March 2009. The appellant had  difficulty  remembering
    when she had done voluntary work and it did not strike us  as  being  a
    particularly important part of her life.

13.   In  the  same  questionnaire  the  appellant  recorded  that  she  had
    children in Jamaica.  No  details  were  given  and  so  we  asked  the
    appellant about the position. She told us that she has  three  children
    in Jamaica, two daughters and her 'baby' who is  10.   Those  daughters
    are aged 20 and 17 and live with their father. Her  'baby'  lives  with
    his grandmother. She also told us that another son was killed last year
    in Jamaica. We were conscious  that  talking  about  her  children  was
    difficult for the appellant.  She has not seen them since she  left  in
    2001.  The appellant explained that she has a  good  relationship  with
    her children. She misses them but speaks to them  'every  day'  on  the
    telephone.  She wants to see them and would like her husband to get  to
    know them. She would like them to be able to come to see her  here  and
    if possible, to live here. The separation  from  her  children,  tinged
    with the tragedy of the death of her  son,  is  something  that  deeply
    upsets the appellant. We were told that Mr Meade takes an  interest  in
    the appellant's children and is keen to establish a  relationship  with
    them.

14.   In answer to a question about when the  appellant  and  Mr  Meade  had
    first  discussed  the  appellant's  immigration  status  and  what  his
    reaction had been, the answer given were  that  they  discussed  it  is
    October or November 2004 and that 'he did not seem bothered about  it'.
    The timing would tie in with the first application for leave to  remain
    which was made shortly thereafter.

15.   The  questionnaire  also  contained  a  question  asking  whether  the
    appellant's spouse would follow her if she was removed from the  United
    Kingdom. The answer given was:

            '... only if he was forced to do so. He said that Jamaica is far
          too violent.'

      This answer was given before the appellant's son was killed which  has
    added to the concern she has about the state of Jamaica.  In  her  oral
    evidence the appellant said that her husband could not move to  Jamaica
    because he is sick, knows nothing about Jamaica and that it is  'not  a
    good country'. There was the hint of a suggestion in her evidence  that
    he was physically incapable of travelling to Jamaica.  We  reject  that
    suggestion. The medical evidence does not support it  and  neither  did
    our observations of Mr Meade.  Additionally, he managed  to  travel  to
    Canada in June 2006 at a time when both  suggest  he  was  in  need  of
    substantial  care  from  the  appellant.  In  her  oral  evidence,  the
    appellant indicated that she would not force him to follow her. In  his
    oral evidence, Mr Meade said that he would not go to Jamaica because of
    his medical  condition.   He  was  concerned  that  he  could  not  get
    medication in Jamaica.

Submissions

16.    Ms  Cantrell's  primary  submission  is  that  the  marriage  is  not
    subsisting or permanent so that Article 8 is not really  in  issue.  We
    have made factual findings which result in that argument  failing.  Her
    secondary argument is that there  is  no  reason  why  the  appellant's
    husband could not reasonably travel to Jamaica, all the more so as  the
    appellant  has  children   there.   Removal   of   the   appellant   is
    proportionate.

17.   Mrs  Afolabi  submits  that  the  marriage  is  a  close  one  and  in
    particular that  Mr  Meade  depends  upon  the  care  provided  by  the
    appellant. She submits that it would not be  reasonable  to  expect  Mr
    Meade to follow the appellant to Jamaica; that  because  the  appellant
    came close to satisfying the immigration rules, the public interest  in
    maintaining immigration control is diminished; and that  nothing  would
    be achieved in requiring the appellant to return to Jamaica to make  an
    application for leave to enter as a spouse. Mrs Afolabi  also  reminded
    us that the Article 8 question must be considered in the light  of  the
    interests of the whole of the family.  That  includes  the  appellant's
    children currently in Jamaica who she wishes to join her  here  in  due
    course.

The Law

18.    We start by referring to a summary of the main principles in play  in
    cases of this sort helpfully drawn together by Sedley LJ in VW (Uganda)
    [2009] EWCA Civ 9:
          "18. In EB (Kosovo) [2008] UKHL 41; [2009] 1 AC 1159, at �12, Lord
          Bingham, with the assent of the other  members  of  the  Appellate
          Committee, said:
          "Thus the  appellate  immigration  authority  must  make  its  own
          judgment and that judgment will  be  strongly  influenced  by  the
          particular facts and circumstances of  the  particular  case.  The
          authority will, of course, take note of  factors  which  have,  or
          have not, weighed with the Strasbourg court. It will, for example,
          recognise that it will rarely be proportionate to uphold an  order
          for removal of a spouse if there is a close and genuine bond  with
          the other spouse and that spouse cannot reasonably be expected  to
          follow the removed spouse to the country of  removal,  or  if  the
          effect  of  the  order  is  to  sever  a  genuine  and  subsisting
          relationship  between  parent  and  child.  But  cases  will   not
          ordinarily raise such stark choices, and there is  in  general  no
          alternative to making a careful and  informed  evaluation  of  the
          facts of the particular case.  The  search  for  a  hard-edged  or
          bright-line rule to be applied  to  the  generality  of  cases  is
          incompatible with the difficult evaluative exercise which  article
          8 requires."
          19. The words which I have italicized lay to rest an  issue  which
          has troubled decision-makers and  advocates  at  least  since  the
          decision of this court in R (Mahmood) v Home  Secretary  [2001]  1
          WLR 840, because of the use by Lord Phillips MR, in the course  of
          giving  the  second  judgment,  of  the   phrase   "insurmountable
          obstacles" in the context of art. 8. ... But for the  present,  at
          least, the last word on the  subject  has  now  been  said  in  EB
          (Kosovo). While it is of course possible that the facts of any one
          case may disclose  an  insurmountable  obstacle  to  removal,  the
          inquiry into proportionality is not a search for such an  obstacle
          and does not end with its elimination. It is a  balanced  judgment
          of what can reasonably  be  expected  in  the  light  of  all  the
          material facts.
          20. What those facts are, however,  can  in  art.  8  cases  be  a
          subject of real difficulty, because  they  may  well  include  the
          intentions of individuals should the very event occur  which  they
          are trying to forestall. I will return to this problem when I come
          to the disposal of the present cases.
          21. Art 8 cases, including those before the court, also  encounter
          occasional  difficulty  in  the  application  of  Lord   Bingham's
          tabulation in Razgar. In �17, it will be recalled, he set out  the
          sequence of questions as follows:
          "(1) Will the proposed removal be  an  interference  by  a  public
          authority with the exercise of the applicant's  right  to  respect
          for his private or (as the case may be) family life?"
          (2) If so,  will  such  interference  have  consequences  of  such
          gravity as potentially to engage the operation of article 8?
          (3) If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?
          (4) If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic  society
          in the interests  of  national  security,  public  safety  or  the
          economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder
          or crime, for the protection of  health  or  morals,  or  for  the
          protection of the rights and freedoms of others?
          (5) If so, is such interference proportionate  to  the  legitimate
          public end sought to be achieved?"
          22. As this court made clear in AG (Eritrea) [2007] EWCA Civ  801,
          �26-28, the phrase "consequences of such gravity" in question  (2)
          posits no specially  high  threshold  for  art.  8(1).  It  simply
          reflects the fact that more than a  technical  or  inconsequential
          interference with one of the protected rights is  needed  if  art.
          8(1) is to be engaged.
          23. There will also be unnecessary difficulty if the  relationship
          of questions  (4)  and  (5)  is  misunderstood.  The  emphasis  in
          question (4) is not on simple necessity but on  whether  the  need
          for the general restriction on the primary right lies  within  one
          of the specified purposes. If it does, then whether the particular
          restriction is necessary in a democratic society engages  question
          (5). Clearly, if the restriction is plainly unnecessary, the  art.
          8 question will be answered in the appellant's  favour;  but  that
          will be rare. In any other case, once a permitted purpose has been
          established in answer to question (4) (as in cases governed by the
          Immigration Rules it generally will  be),  the  inquiry  moves  to
          question (5) which, by focusing  on  the  proportionality  of  the
          measure in the individual case, gives effect to the  jurisprudence
          of the Strasbourg court as to what is "necessary in  a  democratic
          society". There is no discrete or prior test of necessity.
          24. EB (Kosovo) now confirms that the material question in gauging
          the proportionality of a removal or deportation which will or  may
          break up a family unless the family itself decamps is not  whether
          there is an insuperable obstacle to this happening but whether  it
          is reasonable to expect the family to leave  with  the  appellant.
          ..."
19.   In paragraph [29] of  the  same  judgment  Sedley  LJ  identified  the
    question for the  Tribunal  when  considering  Article  8(2)  as  being
    'whether the removal of the appellant, notwithstanding  its  effect  on
    her and others, was proportionate to the legitimate aims of immigration
    control.'  He also endorsed the observation of the  AIT  in  that  case
    that:

            "What must be shown is more than  a  mere  hardship  or  a  mere
          difficulty or a mere obstacle. There is a seriousness  test  which
          requires the obstacles or difficulties to  go  beyond  matters  of
          choice or inconvenience."

20.   We readily accept that since the decision of the  House  of  Lords  in
    Chickwamba [2008] UKHL 40 it is rarely open to the SSHD to suggest that
    an appellant should leave the country and apply from abroad to join his
    spouse. No such argument is advanced  by  Ms  Cantrell  here.  We  also
    accept that if an appellant had failed to comply  with  an  Immigration
    Rule by a whisker then the weight to be accorded to the legitimate aims
    of immigration control would be diminished. However, we do  not  accept
    that is the case here. The appellant failed  to  satisfy  the  relevant
    Rule not by a whisker but by a mile.

21.   In EB (Kosovo) the House of Lords recognised that delay in the  SSHD's
    decision making process may have an impact on the Article 8  assessment
    in three ways. First, during the period of delay the  person  concerned
    may put down deeper roots. Secondly, a relationship entered  into  when
    the person has no leave may be  tentative  when  started  but  as  time
    passes with no action being taken an expectation may have grown that no
    action will be taken. Thirdly, it may reduce the  weight  that  can  be
    accorded to firm and fair immigration  control  (see  Lord  Bingham  at
    paragraphs [14] to [16]).

Discussion and Conclusions

22.   The starting point for our consideration of the Article  8  issues  is
    our acceptance that the appellant has established family  life  in  the
    United Kingdom with her husband. Whilst she has other  adult  relations
    here the only one of which we have heard is her  aunt,  Barbara  Jones.
    They enjoy a close relationship which we take into account although  in
    our view it adds very little weight to the Article 8  claim.  Were  the
    appellant removed from the United Kingdom she would  see  less  of  her
    aunt. Subject to her aunt visiting Jamaica the appellant would maintain
    close touch via  telephone,  as  she  does  currently  with  her  three
    children in Jamaica. Mr Meade's children are in Antigua. There was very
    little evidence before us touching any other aspects of the appellant's
    life in the United Kingdom. We have noted that she is involved  in  her
    Church and that she has undertaken some voluntary work.  No  submission
    was made that a decision by Mr Meade to  follow  his  wife  to  Jamaica
    would cause especial problems in the relationships of either  with  his
    other family members in the United Kingdom.

23. The appellant is  an  overstayer  who  failed  to  take  any  steps  to
    regularise her position  between  June  2002  and  December  2004.  She
    married in full knowledge that  she  was  an  overstayer.  Although  we
    accept that she and her husband  did  not  discuss  immigration  issues
    until the autumn of 2004, we have seen no evidence that  suggests  that
    he believed that his wife had any right  to  be  in  this  country.  He
    appears not to have been curious about the true position.

24. Although Mr Meade has lived in the United Kingdom since at least  1991,
    he has no children in this country and, as  a  result  of  his  medical
    problems, no work. We have seen no evidence of deep or enduring ties in
    this country although we are prepared to accept that he is settled, and
    has relationships with  his  adult  family  members  and  friends.   An
    important question in evaluating issues under Article 8 is  whether  Mr
    Meade would follow his wife to Jamaica if she were removed  there.  The
    starting point is that he wishes to remain in the United  Kingdom  with
    his  wife.  The  medical  evidence  before  us  does  not  support  the
    proposition that  he  is  physically  unable  to  travel  and  we  were
    unimpressed by the bare assertion that unspecified medication would  be
    unavailable in Jamaica. Neither are we impressed by general appeals  to
    the prevalence of violent crime in Jamaica, despite  the  tragedy  that
    befell the appellant's son. The reality is that the appellant wishes to
    be reunited with her children, albeit she would prefer that  to  happen
    here, and her husband is keen to meet them and develop a  relationship.
    Even though the appellant told  us  that  she  would  not  'force'  her
    husband to go to Jamaica with her, an  echo  of  the  language  in  the
    questionnaire, we think it likely, given our assessment of the strength
    of the relationship,  that Mr Meade would follow his wife  to  Jamaica.
    Indeed we think it probable. We recognise, that those who have to  make
    difficult choices of this sort can rarely speak with confidence of  the
    choice they would make before they have to confront  it.  We  recognise
    that this couple would be faced with a  dilemma.  However,  we  do  not
    conclude that Mr Meade 'cannot reasonably be  expected  to  follow  the
    removed spouse to the  country  of  removal',  to  use  Lord  Bingham's
    language in EB (Kosovo). Given all the circumstances  of  the  domestic
    situation our conclusion is that it is  reasonable  to  expect  him  to
    follow his wife to Jamaica.

25. With that finding in mind we return to the central question  identified
    by Sedley LJ  in  VW  (Uganda),  namely  whether  the  removal  of  the
    appellant, notwithstanding its effect  on  her  and  others,  would  be
    proportionate to the legitimate aims of immigration control. (The first
    three 'Razgar' questions we answer affirmatively.)  Her  removal  would
    disrupt the life of her husband if he were to follow her. Its impact on
    the appellant herself would, unusually, be  to  reunite  her  with  her
    three children from whom she has been separated since 2001 and who  she
    desperately misses. That  is  a  singular  feature  of  this  case  and
    contrasts with many where the  facts  suggest  that  the  relationships
    between children and their parents might be dislocated as a  result  of
    the immigration decision. She married in full knowledge that she had no
    right to be in the United Kingdom and her  husband  had  no  reason  to
    suppose that she did. A factor that we also consider in  this  case  is
    that the SSHD took four years to decide the appellant's application for
    leave to remain and, having served her with an  enforcement  notice  in
    January 2008 took no  steps  to  act  upon  it  before  the  Member  of
    Parliament became involved.  We have considered the matters  identified
    by Lord Bingham in EB (Kosovo)  which  can  arise  in  cases  involving
    delay. The circumstances in this case are  nowhere  near  as  stark  as
    those in that case.

26. Taking account of all the matters to which  we  have  referred  we  are
    satisfied that the appellant's  removal  from  the  United  Kingdom  is
    proportionate to the legitimate aims of  immigration  control.  In  the
    circumstances, despite the error of law identified by SIJ Gill  at  the
    first stage hearing (which we accept for the purposes  of  this  second
    stage reconsideration), we dismiss the appeal.

   Decision

27.    The making of the previous decision involved the making of  an  error
on    a point of law.

28.    We set aside the previous decision.

29.   Our decision is that the human rights (Article 8 ECHR) appeal  of  the
      appellant is dismissed.
