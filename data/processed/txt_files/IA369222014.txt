DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction
1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
   anonymity direction.  No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
   respect of this Appellant. Having considered all  the  circumstances  and
   evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
2. In order to avoid confusion, the parties are referred to as they were  in
   the First-tier Tribunal.
3. The Appellant is a citizen of  Pakistan  born  on  29  August  1990.  The
   Appellant is appealing against the decision of the Respondent made on  13
   September 2014 to curtail the Appellant's leave to remain in  the  United
   Kingdom as a spouse under paragraph 322(5A) of the Immigration Rules  and
   to remove him from the UK.
4. The Appellant appealed that decision and after a hearing on  19  February
   2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Law found  that  the  decision  under  the
   Rules to curtail his leave was justified but  allowed  the  appeal  under
   Article 8. I set aside that decision after a hearing on 30 November  2015
   in so far as it related to Article 8 as it contained errors  of  law  and
   the matter comes back before me for rehearing.
5. The background to this appeal is that the Appellant  entered  the  United
   Kingdom on 1 July 2010 as a Tier 4 Student with leave until  8  September
   2011. On 22 November 2012 the Appellant was convicted of  an  offence  of
   Causing Death while Driving uninsured. The  Appellant  was  sentenced  in
   respect of the offence on 17 April 2014 to a period of unpaid work in the
   community. On 11 September 2014 the Appellant was granted  limited  leave
   to remain in the United Kingdom until 10 September 2016 as the spouse  of
   a British Citizen having initially been refused a variation of his  leave
   on the basis that he had failed to provide the required English  Language
   certificate and appealed that decision. The reasons given in the decision
   letter curtailing the Appellant's leave  were  that  the  Respondent  was
   satisfied that the Appellant's leave should be curtailed because  it  was
   undesirable for him to remain in the United Kingdom in the light  of  his
   conviction as it was an offence that caused serious  harm  in  accordance
   with paragraph 322(5A) of the Rules.


The Law

6. The burden of proof in this case is upon the Appellant and  the  standard
   of proof is upon the balance of probability.
7. As the Appellant is in the  United  Kingdom,  I  can  take  into  account
   evidence that concerns a matter arising after the date of the decision in
   accordance with Section 85(4) Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
   2002.

8. The Appellant's appeal is pursuant to Section 82 of the 2002 Act.

9. In relation to claims under Article 8 these are addressed by Appendix  FM
   and paragraph 276ADE of the Rules and the Secretary of State's  Guidance.
   If an applicant does not meet the criteria set  out  in  the  Rules  then
   guidance issued by the Secretary of State in  the  form  of  instructions
   provides in effect, that leave to  remain  outside  the  rules  could  be
   granted  in  the  exercise  of  residual   discretion   in   'exceptional
   circumstances' which are defined in the guidance and must be exercised on
   the basis of  Article  8  considerations,  in  particular  assessing  all
   relevant factors in determining whether a decision is proportionate under
   Article 8.2.

10. It is now generally accepted that the new IRs do not provide in  advance
   for every nuance in the application of Article 8 in individual cases.  At
   para 30 of Nagre, Sales J said:


   "30.     ... if, after the process of applying the new rules and  finding
       that the claim for leave to remain under them  fails,  the  relevant
       official  or  tribunal  judge  considers  it  is  clear   that   the
       consideration under the Rules has fully addressed any family life or
       private life issues arising under Article 8, it would be  sufficient
       simply to say that; they would not have to go on,  in  addition,  to
       consider the case separately from the Rules. If there is no arguable
       case that there may be good grounds for  granting  leave  to  remain
       outside the Rules by reference to Article 8, there would be no point
       in introducing full separate consideration of Article 8 again  after
       having reached a decision on application of the Rules."

11. This was also endorsed by the Court of Appeal in Singh and Khalid  where
   Underhill LJ said (at para 64):


   "64.     ... there is no need to conduct a full separate  examination  of
       article 8 outside  the  Rules  where,  in  the  circumstances  of  a
       particular  case,  all  the  issues  have  been  addressed  in   the
       consideration under the Rules."



12. More recently the Court of Appeal  in  SS  Congo  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387
   stated in paragraph 33:


   "In our judgment, even though a test of exceptionality does not apply  in
   every case falling within the scope of Appendix FM, it is accurate to say
   that the general position outside the sorts of special contexts  referred
   to above is that compelling circumstances would need to be identified  to
   support a claim for grant of LTR outside the new Rules in Appendix FM. In
   our view, that is a formulation which is not  as  strict  as  a  test  of
   exceptionality or a requirement of "very compelling reasons" (as referred
   to in MF (Nigeria) in the context of  the  Rules  applicable  to  foreign
   criminals),  but  which  gives  appropriate   weight   to   the   focused
   consideration of public interest  factors  as  finds  expression  in  the
   Secretary of State's formulation of the new Rules in Appendix FM. It also
   reflects the formulation in Nagre at para. [29], which  has  been  tested
   and has survived scrutiny in this court: see, e.g., Haleemudeen at  [44],
   per Beatson LJ. "

13. Section 117A (2) of the 2002 Act  provides  that  where  a  Tribunal  is
   required to determine whether a decision made under the Immigration  Acts
   would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998  it  must,
   in considering 'the public interest question', have regard in  all  cases
   to  the  considerations  listed  in  section117B  of   the   Nationality,
   Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended by the Immigration Act 2014).
   Section 117 (3) provides that the 'public interest  question'  means  the
   question of whether an interference with a person's right to respect  for
   private and family life is justified under Article 8(2).
14. The S117B considerations are as follows:

         "(1)     The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in
             the public interest.

         (2)      It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are able to speak  English,  because  persons  who  can  speak
             English-

             (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (3)      It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are financially independent, because such persons-

             (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (4)      Little weight should be given to-

             (a) a private life, or

             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,  that  is
                  established by a person at a time when the  person  is  in
                  the United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5)       Little  weight  should  be  given  to  a   private   life
             established  by  a  person  at  a  time  when   the   person's
             immigration status is precarious.

         (6)      In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation,
             the public interest does  not  require  the  person's  removal
             where-

             (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
                  relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave
                  the United Kingdom."
Evidence


15. On the file I had the Respondents bundle. I had a  copy  of  the  reason
   for refusal letter. The Appellant put  in  an  appeal  and  a  bundle  of
   documents numbered 1-33 that was before the First-tier Tribunal was  also
   available to me. In addition,  the  Appellant  submitted  two  additional
   letters one from the Sponsors GP  dated  17  February  2016  and  one  to
   confirm that the Appellant was a Muslim.
16. I heard evidence from the Appellant which can be summarised as follows:
17. He adopted the contents of his witness statement of 11 February 2015.
18. He said that his wife could not live  in  Pakistan  because  she  was  a
   Hindu. He confirmed that  his  family  there  were  not  happy  with  his
   marriage. Her family in the UK would not talk to them as he was a  Muslim
   and they did not like him. He confirmed  that  his  wife  was  a  British
   citizen and had Type 2 diabetes.
19. In cross examination he confirmed that both he and  his  wife  practised
   their religions by attending their places of worship and she had a shrine
   at home and he read the Koran.
20. Theirs was a love match after they met at  an  Asian  social  event.  If
   they had children their religion would be a matter for them.
21. He had had completed the equivalent  of  A  levels  in  Pakistan  before
   coming to the UK to do an English course
22. His wife worked full time as a caf� manager and earned �10,000 a year.
23. The offence which led to his leave being curtailed was one of causing  a
   death while driving without the necessary insurance: he had insurance but
   not business insurance.
24. They did not have many friends in the UK. His wife worked full time  and
   on Saturdays so they were together in  the  evenings  and  Sundays,  They
   walked together, ate out. While his wife was at work he slept or  watched
   TV.
25. In response to a question by  me  he  stated  he  could  not  return  to
   Pakistan and apply for entry clearance as his wife would  be  left  alone
   and depressed. She was not a well woman. His family would not support him
   if he returned and  they  would  find  out  he  had  returned.  Mr  Ahmed
   interposed that the Appellant could not return to  Pakistan  and  reapply
   for entry clearance as he was unlikely to  succeed  in  that  application
   given the offence he had committed. I suggested that was a matter for his
   final submissions.
26. I heard evidence from Josita Rajoria the Appellants wife.
27. She adopted the contents of her witness statement  at  page  10  of  the
   bundle.
28. She affirmed that it was not  possible  for  her  to  live  in  Pakistan
   because she was a practising Hindu and this would put her  at  risk.  She
   also stated that she was a diabetic and was  unsure  what  treatment  was
   available in Pakistan and she worked full time.
29. She confirmed her husband's account of how they met and that theirs  was
   a love match and their different religions  had  not  impacted  on  their
   decision. She had never spoken to  the  Appellant's  family  in  Pakistan
   although she got on fine with his family in the UK although she  had  not
   seen them very often with working full time.She earned �10,000 a year .
30. She could not live in Pakistan nor could she live in India.  She  stated
   she had only been to India once with her mother and brother last November
   and she did not like it.
31. They did not socialise with her family members although he had met  them
   a few times. She spoke to her mother on the phone.
32. If the decision went against her husband she would not go  and  live  in
   Pakistan.
Final Submissions
33. Mr Harrison made the following submissions on behalf of the Respondent:
   a) He relied on the reasons for refusal and the curtailment notice.
   b) He suggested that their family life appeared  to  be  very  'stilted',
      limited.
   c) He suggested that it would be possible  for  the  Appellants  wife  to
      return with him and live in Pakistan.
   d) He reminded me of the provisions of section 117B  of  the  Nationality
      Immigration Act 2002.
34. Mr Ahmed on behalf of the Appellant made the following submissions:
   a) The Appellant and his wife had given credible evidence.
   b) Their marriage had caused problems with their respective families.
   c) There was now  objective  evidence  before  the  court  that  such  an
      interfaith marriage would put the sponsor at risk  in  Pakistan.  They
      had married in a civil ceremony and such a marriage would not even  be
      recognised in Pakistan.
   d) The Appellant could not reapply  for  entry  clearance  from  Pakistan
      because of his previous conviction.
   e) The compelling circumstances in this case were that the Appellant  and
      his wife could not live together in  Pakistan  and  therefore  it  was
      unreasonable and disproportionate to remove him
Findings
35. On balance and taking the evidence  as  a  whole,  I  have  reached  the
   following findings
36. The Appellant is a 25 year  old  citizen  of  Pakistan  whose  leave  to
   remain in the UK as the Josita  Rajoria  was  curtailed  under  paragraph
   322(5A) of the Immigration Rules which sets out grounds on which leave to
   remain and variation of leave to enter or remain in  the  United  Kingdom
   should normally be refused and includes at 5A:
   "(5A) it is undesirable to permit the person concerned to enter or remain
   in the United Kingdom because, in the view of the Secretary of State:
   (a) their offending has caused serious harm; or
   (b) they are a persistent offender who shows a particular  disregard  for
   the law;"
37.  The decision arose out  of  his  conviction  on  22  November  2012  of
   causing death while driving uninsured on 21 December 2011  on  the  basis
   that it had caused serious harm. The Judge in the First tier upheld  that
   decision and therefore the only basis on which the Appellant can base his
   appeal is that the decision to remove him breaches his  right  to  family
   and private life under Article 8.

38. I have determined the issue on the basis of the questions posed by  Lord
   Bingham in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27


Will the proposed removal be an interference by a public authority with  the
exercise of the applicant's right to respect for  his  private  (or  as  the
case may be) family life?


39. I am satisfied that the Appellant and his wife have a family  life  with
   each other in the United Kingdom. The Appellant originally entered the UK
   as a student with leave to remain until 8 September  2011.Shortly  before
   that leave expired  the  Appellant  married  on  22  August  2011.  I  am
   satisfied that the relationship however was established at  a  time  when
   the Appellants status was precarious,  the  marriage  taking  place  just
   before his leave  expired  and  always  dependent  on  them  meeting  the
   requirements of the Rules for another grant of leave. I am satisfied that
   they were aware of this.


40.  The family life enjoyed by the parties  in  this  case  appears  to  be
   limited to the relationship that they have with  each  other  as  neither
   sides family have apparently embraced  their  mixed  faith  relationship.
   There were certainly no statements in support of the Appellant  from  any
   of his family members in the UK or indeed from  his  wife's  family.  The
   time that the Appellant and his wife have together is limited by the fact
   that the Appellants spouse works a six day week and works long hours each
   day while he stays at their home and sleeps and watches television. There
   was no evidence  of  any  private  life  beyond  their  relationship,  no
   evidence of engagement with the community other than a confirmation  that
   the Appellant attends a mosque.


If  so,  will  such  interference  have  consequences  of  such  gravity  as
potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?


41. I am satisfied that removal of the Appellant would have consequences  of
   such gravity as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8.


If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?


42. I am satisfied that there is in place the legislative framework for  the
   decision giving rise to the interference with Article 8 rights  which  is
   precise and accessible enough for the Appellant to regulate  his  conduct
   by reference to it.


If so, is such  interference  necessary  in  a  democratic  society  in  the
interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being  of
the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection  of
health or morals, or for  the  protection  of  the  rights  and  freedom  of
others?


43. The interference does have legitimate aims since it  is  in  pursuit  of
   one of the legitimate aims set out in Article 8 (2) necessary in  pursuit
   of the economic wellbeing of the country through the maintenance  of  the
   requirements of a policy of immigration control. The state has the  right
   to control the entry of non-nationals into its territory  and  Article  8
   does not mean that an individual can choose where she wishes to enjoy his
   private and family life.


If so, is such interference  proportionate  to  the  legitimate  public  end
sought to be achieved?


44. Consideration of the issue of proportionality is 'consideration of  "the
   public interest question" as defined by section 117A(3) of the 2002  Act.
   I am therefore required by section  117A(2)(a)  to  have  regard  to  the
   considerations listed in section 117B. I must therefore take into account
   that the maintenance of immigration control is in the public interest.  I
   am satisfied that the Immigration Rules underpin  that  control.  I  take
   into account that the Appellant has been in the UK at all times with  the
   required leave but a decision was made to curtail the  Appellant's  leave
   because he was convicted of an offence which caused serious harm and that
   was a decision that was upheld on appeal.

45. I accept that the Appellant speaks English. I accept that his  wife  has
   a full time job albeit her income at �10,000 would not meet  the  minimum
   income requirements of Appendix FM. I am unable to make  a  finding  that
   the Appellant and his wife are financially independent in  so  far  as  I
   have seen no evidence relating to their finances and therefore  there  is
   no  information  before  me  as  to  whether  or  not  their  income   is
   supplemented by state benefits.

46. I am obliged to give little weight to a private life  formed  while  the
   Appellants status was precarious. I am satisfied in any event that on the
   basis of the evidence before me that  there  was  little  evidence  of  a
   private life for the Appellant beyond his marital  relationship  and  his
   religious observances.


47. I have reminded myself that Lord Bingham in  Razgar  stated  that  in  a
   judgement on proportionality that the ultimate question is, "whether  the
   refusal of leave to enter or remain in circumstances where  the  life  of
   the family cannot reasonably be expected to be enjoyed elsewhere,  taking
   full account of all considerations weighing in  favour  of  the  refusal,
   prejudices the family life of the  applicant  in  a  manner  sufficiently
   serious to amount to a breach  of  the  fundamental  right  protected  by
   Article 8. If the answer to this question is affirmative, the refusal  is
   unlawful and the authority must so decide."


48. I have therefore  assessed  whether  it  would  be  reasonable  for  the
   Appellant and sponsor to continue their family life in Pakistan.  I  have
   been provided with the  January  2016  COIS  on  Interfaith  Marriage  in
   Pakistan and I have considered section 7 which sets out the position  for
   a Muslim man who marries a Hindu woman and at 7.1.1 confirms that Islamic
   law does not recognise Muslim marriages to Hindus or  Sikhs.  Given  this
   view, couples in such unions may be deemed to be having sexual  relations
   outside of marriage, which is considered an offence and is punishable  by
   imprisonment for up to five years and a fine.  In  relation  to  societal
   treatment and attitudes there were allegations of  kidnappings  of  Hindu
   women and girls, forcibly converted to Islam and married to Muslim men. I
   accept that the  Appellant's  family  in  Pakistan  do  not  support  his
   marriage. At this point I note that the sponsor raised the issue  of  her
   health in that she is a type 2 diabetic. I note that although  she  is  a
   diabetic she appears to have her diabetes under control and  it  has  not
   impacted on her ability to work full time. Therefore  I  would  not  have
   found that the sponsor's diabetes impacted on the reasonableness  of  her
   relocating. Mr Harrison questioned the sponsor about the  possibility  of
   the parties living in India but I note that she is a British citizen  who
   has only ever visited the country once. There was no evidence  before  me
   to suggest that being of Indian heritage would give her  or  her  husband
   the right to live in India.


49. Taking all of those factors  relating  to  interfaith  marriage  however
   into account I accept  that  it  would  be  unreasonable  to  expect  the
   Appellants wife to relocate with him to Pakistan.


50. I have considered whether it would be disproportionate  to  require  the
   Appellant to return to Pakistan to re apply  for  entry  clearance  as  a
   spouse and in the light of all of the  factors  I  set  out  below  I  am
   satisfied that such a temporary separation would not be disproportionate.
   Requiring the Appellant to return to his  home  country  resulting  in  a
   temporary separation is not of itself unreasonable: R (on the application
   of Chen) v SSHD  (Appendix  FM  -  Chikwamba  -  temporary  separation  -
   proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC). Mr Ahmed argued  that  this
   would be unreasonable in this case  as  the  Appellant  would  simply  be
   refused on the basis of the  conviction  that  led  to  his  leave  being
   curtailed.

51. I am not satisfied that the argument has merit. I  note  that  in  Sabir
   (appendix FM-EX 1 not fee standing) 2014 UKUT 00063 the tribunal said  at
   paragraph 33

   "... She does not meet the requirements of the rules and it was clear  at
   the time of the marriage that she could not do so; she would be  expected
   to leave the UK and return to Pakistan to make an application  for  entry
   clearance, absent circumstances such that such a course of  action  would
   be unreasonable or harsh, contrary to her right to respect for family and
   private life. The likelihood or otherwise  of  being  able  to  meet  the
   requirements  of  the  rules  for  entry  clearance  is  not  a  relevant
   consideration."

52. I also note that in Mumu (paragraph 320; Article 8; scope)  [2012]  UKUT
   00143(IAC) an out of country case for  spouse  settlement,  the  Tribunal
   said that the  weight  to  be  given  to  the  Respondents  interests  in
   conducting the proportionality balancing exercise under Article  8(2)  of
   the ECHR is not to  be  automatically  diminished  by  reference  to  the
   consideration - (a) that a person may be able to  take  advantage  of  an
   exception in paragraph  320(7C)  in  any  future  application  for  entry
   clearance; or, conversely (b) that there is a danger the  person  may  be
   refused under paragraph 320(11) by reference to conduct that has  led  to
   his or her current application being refused under paragraph 320(7A).

53. I also note that the test that applied  under  paragraph  322(5A),  that
   the offending caused 'serious harm' is different to that which  might  be
   applicable under Appendix FM. I note that while there are provisions  for
   mandatory refusal under S-EC.1.4 these require the applicant to have been
   sentenced to a period of  imprisonment  which  this  Appellant  was  not.
   Otherwise the relevant  provision  that  arguably  could  apply  to  this
   Appellant would be S-EC.1.5 that reads

   "S-EC.1.5. The exclusion of the applicant from the UK is conducive to the
   public good because, for  example,  the  applicant's  conduct  (including
   convictions which do not fall  within  paragraph  S-EC.1.4.),  character,
   associations, or other reasons, make it undesirable to grant  them  entry
   clearance."

54. I am not able to speculate about  what  position  the  Respondent  would
   take about the relevance of the Appellants  conviction  when  applying  a
   different test. It may well be that there are factors  peculiar  to  this
   offence that might allow arguments to be advanced as to why in this  case
   the conviction should not be held  against  the  Appellant.  Although  no
   evidence was produced of the Judge's sentencing remarks there was clearly
   some mitigation: thus for example while I note that this was  an  offence
   which carries imprisonment on conviction the Appellants was not sentenced
   to a period of imprisonment but to a short period of  community  service;
   this was not a conviction that reflected on the manner of the  Appellants
   driving; the Appellant claimed that he had insurance but not for  driving
   in a business capacity. These are all relevant matters  set  out  in  the
   Sentencing Guidelines which if  supported  by  the  appropriate  evidence
   could be relevant to a decision under S-EC.1.5.

55. In determining  whether  the  removal  would  be  proportionate  to  the
   legitimate aim of immigration control I  find  that  none  of  the  facts
   underpinning the Appellants life  in  the  United  Kingdom  taken  either
   singularly  or  cumulatively  outweigh  the  legitimate  purpose  of  the
   Appellants removal.

56. I have considered the  issue  of  anonymity  in  the  present  instance.
   Neither party has sought a direction. The Appellant is an adult and not a
   vulnerable person. I see no reason to make any direction in this regard.



CONCLUSION


57. On the facts as established in this appeal,  there  are  no  substantial
   grounds for believing  that  the  Appellant's  removal  would  result  in
   treatment in breach of ECHR.


DECISION

58. The appeal is dismissed under Article 8 ECHR.
