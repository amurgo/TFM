                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Dammi Dilip Kumara  Rajapaksha  Pedige,  date  of  birth
    16.1.86, is a citizen of Sri Lanka.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Cary promulgated 9.10.14, dismissing on all  grounds  his  appeal
    against  the  decisions  of  the  Secretary  of  State  to  refuse  his
    application made on 5.3.14 for leave to remain in the UK as a dependant
    partner of a Tier 1 General Migrant, pursuant to paragraph 319E of  the
    Immigration Rules, and to remove him from the UK pursuant to section 47
    of the Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.   The  Judge  heard
    the appeal on 3.10.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Pooler  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    27.11.14. However, when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, on 31.3.15  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Sheridan  granted
    permission to appeal, but on article 8 ECHR grounds only, on the  basis
    that Judge Cary had  failed  to  address  the  fact  that  a  same  sex
    relationship is not lawful in Sri Lanka.

 4. The Rule 24 response, dated 21.4.15,  points  out  that  the  appellant
    chose not to apply for leave to remain on  the  basis  of  a  same  sex
    relationship

 5. Thus the matter came before me on 5.6.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 6. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Cary should be  set  aside.  After
    hearing the submissions of the representatives of the parties I reached
    the conclusion that there is no material error in the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal. I reserved my reasons, which I now give.

 7. The appellant last entered the UK on 17.9.13,  with  limited  leave  to
    remain as the dependent partner of a Tier 1  migrant.  The  application
    which is the subject matter of this appeal, made  on  5.3.14,  was  for
    indefinite leave to remain as the partner of  a  points  based  migrant
    (PBS).

 8. It follows from the grant of permission that the judge's  findings  and
    conclusions in relation to paragraph 319E must stand. As Judge Sheridan
    pointed out, the First-tier Tribunal Judge found that the Secretary  of
    State was entitled to rely on paragraph 319E(i) as  the  appellant  had
    previously overstayed longer than 28 days. The grounds  of  application
    for permission to appeal did not challenge this finding and  thus  even
    if there were to be an error of law in respect of 319E(d),  as  claimed
    in the grounds, it was immaterial to  the  outcome  of  the  appeal  on
    immigration grounds.

 9. In refusing permission to appeal,  Judge  Pooler  had  noted  that  the
    grounds  did  not  address   the   final   requirement   in   paragraph
    319E(d)(ii)(c), and did not  identify  an  arguable  error  of  law  in
    relation to the decision under the Immigration Rules.  The  application
    as made was doomed to failure on multiple grounds from the outset.

10. Of course, the appellant's failure to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules for the application made is highly  relevant  to  any  article  8
    assessment outside the Rules.

11. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Sheridan noted that the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge  stated  at  �31  that  there  is  nothing  in  the
    appellant's  statement  to  suggest  any  compelling   or   exceptional
    circumstances. "However, the appellant's statement refers to him  being
    in a same sex union that is not lawful in Sri Lanka...  By  failing  to
    address this issue, which is arguably material to the  outcome  of  the
    article 8 assessment, it is arguable that the judge has erred in law."

12. It is obvious from a reading of the First-tier Tribunal  decision  that
    Judge Cary did recognise and take into account that the appellant is in
    a same-sex relationship. At �27 the judge found that  family  life  had
    been established by  this  relationship,  together  with  a  degree  of
    private life. The judge also accepted  that  the  consequences  of  the
    decision were of such gravity as to interfere  with  that  private  and
    family life, so as to engage article 8.  The  judge  then  went  on  to
    consider the crucial issue in the Razgar stepped approach, that of  the
    proportionality balancing exercise between on the one hand  the  rights
    of the appellant and his partner, and on the other the  legitimate  and
    necessary aim of protecting the economic well-being of the  UK  through
    immigration control.

13. As noted, the appellant made a particular  application  for  indefinite
    leave to remain under specific provisions for which  his  circumstances
    did not qualify him. He could have but in fact made no application  for
    leave to remain as a partner under Appendix FM.  The  refusal  decision
    noted that the Secretary of State had not considered  leave  to  remain
    under Appendix FM of the  Immigration  Rules,  including  EX1,  as  the
    appellant had made no such application.  He  was  advised  that  if  he
    wanted the Secretary of State to consider such an application, he  must
    make a separate chargeable application on the  specified  form.  Within
    his appeal to the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing the appellant  did
    not suggest that he could meet either Appendix FM in respect of  family
    life, or paragraph 276ADE in  respect  of  private  life,  although  he
    raised the issue of article 8 ECHR private and family life. It  follows
    that the appellant did not suggest  to  the  Tribunal  considering  his
    appeal that there  were  any  insurmountable  obstacles  to  continuing
    family life with his partner outside the UK. The grounds of  appeal  do
    not make any such suggestion. At the  request  of  the  appellant,  the
    appeal was dealt with as a paper case and there was no  oral  evidence;
    the judge had only the evidence then present on the case file on  which
    to reach his decision.

14. It was open to the  appellant  to  apply  for  leave  to  remain  under
    Appendix FM, the Secretary of State's response to article 8 family life
    rights. He did not do so. Neither did  he  raise  it  in  his  one-stop
    grounds of appeal. However, it remains open to him to do so. Even if he
    is unable to do so from within the UK, he can do what he did  recently,
    return to Sri Lanka to  make  his  application.  There  is  nothing  to
    suggest that this would be unreasonable or unduly harsh. This is not  a
    Chikwamba situation, as it remains to be seen whether the appellant can
    demonstrate that all the requirements of Appendix FM are met.  However,
    given that such an  application,  under  the  Rules,  is  open  to  the
    appellant, I fail to see how the decision of the Secretary of State  to
    refuse the precise application made by him and to advise him to make  a
    fresh application under the appropriate Rules if he wants  family  life
    to be considered, can be disproportionate. Article 8 is not a  shortcut
    to compliance  with  the  Immigration  Rules.  There  is  a  route  for
    settlement that is open to the appellant under the Rules and  in  those
    circumstances, there is no  merit  in  the  argument  that  failure  to
    consider whether the appellant and his partner can continue family life
    in Sri Lanka amounts to an error of law.  Pending  the  outcome  of  an
    application under the Rules, such consideration outside  the  Rules  is
    premature.

Conclusion & Decision:

15. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.

Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
