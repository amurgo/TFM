For the Appellant:     Mr Haywood, instructed by Rodman Pearce
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION and REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The  appellants  made  applications  under  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006 which were refused.    Both  appellants
    were given a right of appeal under the EEA Regulations and by virtue of
    Regulation 26 and Section 82 of the Nationality Immigration and  Asylum
    Act 2020.  The appellants' remedies were by way of appeal  despite  the
    First Tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pacey  finding  that  as  judicial  review
    proceedings were lodged the First Tier Tribunal  had  no  jurisdiction.
    Judicial review is a remedy of discretion and cannot negate a statutory
    right of appeal.

 2. It was conceded by the respondent in a response under Rule  24  of  The
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  that  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Pacey  contained  an  error  of  law.   The
    Tribunal had jurisdiction.  Further to Section 104 of  the  Nationality
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002,  an  appeal  under  Section  82(1)  is
    pending until it is finally determined, withdrawn or abandoned or  when
    it lapses under Section 99.  None of these circumstances apply.

 3. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified.  I set aside the
    decision pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007).  Bearing in mind the nature and extent
    of the findings to be made the matter should be remitted to the  First-
    tier Tribunal under section 12(2) (b) (i) of the TCE 2007  and  further
    to  7.2  (b)  of  the  Presidential   Practice   Statement.    In   the
    circumstances the matter should be considered for an expedited hearing.





Signed      Date 13th April 2015

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal Rimington
