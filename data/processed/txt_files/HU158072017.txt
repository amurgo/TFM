Representation:
For the claimant: Mr S Muquit, instructed by Deccan Prime Solicitors
For the appellant:     Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Traynor promulgated  17.12.18,  allowing  on  human
    rights grounds the  claimant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State, dated 19.11.17, to refuse his application  made  on
    8.8.17 for Indefinite  Leave  to  Remain  on  the  basis  of  10  years
    continuous lawful residence in the UK pursuant to paragraph 276B of the
    Immigration Rules.

 2. The application was refused on consideration of the general grounds for
    refusal under paragraph 322(5), which in  turn  led  to  refusal  under
    paragraph 276D and  refusal  on  suitability  grounds  under  paragraph
    276ADE consideration of private life.

 3. In essence, the Secretary of State considered it  was  undesirable  for
    the claimant to remain in  the  UK  on  the  basis  that  he  had  been
    dishonest or deceitful in his dealings  with  HMRC  and/or  immigration
    authorities, either failing to declare  by  a  significant  margin  his
    claimed self-employment earnings, or by falsely representing his income
    in order to obtain Leave to Remain in the UK.

 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge Grimmett  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    10.1.19, finding it  arguable  that  the  judge  erred  by  failing  to
    consider and apply R (on the application of Khan) v  SSHD  (Dishonesty,
    tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC).

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons summarised below, I found such  error  of  law  in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to require  it  to
    be set aside and remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Taylor House.

 6. Mr Muquit submitted that Khan had not been promulgated before  the  day
    of the hearing before Judge Traynor on 8.8.18. However, Khan was  heard
    by Mr Justice Spencer on 14.2.18 and the decision  was  promulgated  on
    3.5.18. The First-tier Tribunal  decision  of  Judge  Traynor  was  not
    promulgated until 17.12.18. In the circumstances, Khan  is  a  decision
    that should have been considered by the First-tier Tribunal.

 7. At (iv) of the headnote in Khan, the Upper Tribunal held that  "for  an
    applicant to simply blame his or  her  accountant  for  an  'error'  in
    relation to the historical tax return  will  not  be  the  end  of  the
    matter, given that the accountant will or should  have  asked  the  tax
    payer to confirm that the return was accurate and to  have  signed  the
    tax return. Furthermore, the applicant will have known of  his  or  her
    earnings and will have expected to pay tax thereon.  If  the  applicant
    does not take steps within a reasonable time to remedy  the  situation,
    the Secretary of State may be entitled to conclude  that  this  failure
    justifies a conclusion that there has been deceit or dishonesty."

 8. In order to avoid falling into a trap on  the  issue  of  discrepancies
    between  HMRC  declared  earnings  and  claims  made   in   immigration
    applications, in Khan Mr Justice Spencer  also  set  out  a  number  of
    relevant factors when considering whether or not an applicant has  been
    dishonest or merely careless, as well as the extent to which  they  are
    evidenced as opposed to merely asserted:

      a) Whether  the  explanation  for  the  error  by  the  accountant  is
         plausible;

      b) Whether the documentation  which  can  be  assumed  to  exist  (for
         example, correspondence between the applicant and his accountant at
         the time of the tax return)  has  been  disclosed  or  there  is  a
         plausible explanation for why it is missing;

      c) Why the applicant did not realise  than  an  error  had  been  made
         because his liability to pay tax  was  less  than  he  should  have
         expected;

      d) Whether, at any stage, the applicant has taken steps to remedy  the
         situation  and,  if  so,  when  those  steps  were  taken  and  the
         explanation for any significant delay.

 9. Mr Muquit drew  my  attention  to  various  parts  of  Judge  Traynor's
    decision to suggest that even  though  Khan  was  not  considered,  the
    substance of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  took  account  of
    all relevant factors. For example, reliance was placed on  [24],  [30],
    [36] and [37] where the claimant claimed that the error was made by his
    previous accountants and only discovered by  his  present  accountants,
    that he had tried without success to contact the previous  accountants,
    and that he had not been cross-examined on this evidence. My  attention
    was also drawn to the HMRC letter dated 9.2.17 at F1 of the  claimant's
    bundle in which active consideration was given to whether  any  penalty
    charge should be pursued.

10. However, it is clear that Judge Traynor placed considerable  weight  on
    the fact that the alleged outstanding liability had been discharged and
    at  [42]  that  HMRC  had  allegedly  fully  accepted  the   claimant's
    explanation for the under-declaration and  in  consequence  waived  the
    penalties which might otherwise have been  payable.  I  find  that  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to  follow  even  the  principle  of  the
    recommended steps when assessing the  claimant's  actions,  effectively
    absolving him of any responsibility to ensure that his tax returns were
    correct. No reasons have been provided for accepting that the  claimant
    would not have been aware of the errors sooner, particularly given that
    his tax liability would have been significantly  lower  than  expected,
    given that the earnings were under-declared by approximately �15,000 on
    a total income of �24,000 so that he only declared �9,000. Further  the
    decision is absent of any findings or reasoning as  to  why  the  judge
    disregarded the fact that the discrepancy was not rectified sooner than
    it was, several years later. Of  course,  the  suspicion  of  the  Home
    Office was that he had either inflated his income for  the  purpose  of
    making an immigration application, or  had  dishonestly  under-declared
    his income to HMRC.

11. The approach taken at [36], [40] and [42], is that the judge appears to
    have taken the actions of HMRC as being at least in part  determinative
    of  the  claimant's  innocence,  These  findings  ignored   the   Upper
    Tribunal's approach to the relevance of HMRC action in similar cases.

12. In its grounds of application for permission to appeal,  the  Secretary
    of  State  relied  on  the  Judicial  Review  decision  in  R  (on  the
    application of Samant) v SSHD [2017]  UKAITUR  JR/6546/2016,  where  at
    [22] the Upper Tribunal pointed out the difficulty  when  there  is  no
    evidence from HMRC as to whether they  did  consider  the  question  of
    penalty or other steps and their reasoning for deciding, as they did in
    this case to accept the late underpayment and not to pursue  penalties.
    The Upper Tribunal held that it cannot be assumed that  in  every  case
    HMRC would have gone through the exercise they perhaps should  have  to
    conclude there was no culpability. "It seems to me that  in  any  given
    case, depending on amounts, depending on the  circumstances,  HMRC  may
    well decide that the effort in reaching particular conclusions  frankly
    is not justified in all the circumstances. I am afraid I do  not  think
    that the fact that HMRC has decided not  to  take  further  action  can
    indicate that the decision of the Secretary of State is  one  which  is
    irrational."

13. Similarly, at [75] of Abbasi, the Upper Tribunal stated, "That HMRC has
    not yet seen fit to issue a penalty notice is neither here  nor  there.
    No doubt HMRC has leeway within which to  issue  a  penalty  notice  or
    institute proceedings and time would only have started running when the
    declaration was made in late 2015... In any event what the HMRC does or
    does not do is not necessarily relevant to actions by the Secretary  of
    State in deciding applications for indefinite leave to remain."

14. Whilst the HMRC letter referred to above indicates that the failure  to
    make amendment to the 2011-12 tax return until 31.1.17 was viewed as  a
    failure to take reasonable care with his tax affairs, it does not go as
    far  as  accepting  the  claimant's  explanations,  as  the  judge  has
    suggested. The reasons  for  mitigating  any  penalties  was  cited  as
    comprising elements of mitigation based on his disclosure, cooperation,
    and giving access to the information. On the evidence, there was little
    to indicate that there had in fact  been  any  error  by  the  previous
    accountants. Similarly, no adequate explanation was offered as  to  why
    the claimant would not have signed or confirmed the accounts  submitted
    in which he should have realised any error. This was not the case of  a
    minor accounting error and the gross discrepancy  does  not  appear  to
    have any adequate explanation. The evidence  as  far  as  it  went  was
    consistent with the claimant having inflated his claimed income in  his
    previous immigration  application  and  having  realised  in  2017  the
    difficulty this now placed him in sought to resolve the discrepancy  in
    the only way he could by falsely claiming a previous  under-declaration
    of income and paying the back taxes due. The timing of him  doing  this
    appears  to  be  at  the  very  least  convenient  to  his  making  the
    application a few months later, in August 2017. The First-tier Tribunal
    does not appear to have  given  the  alternative  explanation  for  the
    discrepancy  any  serious  consideration  but   merely   accepted   the
    claimant's account.

15. In all the circumstances, I find that the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal does  disclose  material  errors  in  the  assessment  of  the
    evidence so that it should be set aside and remade.

Remittal

16. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts are  unclear  on  a
    crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of  those  issues.
    The errors of the First-tier Tribunal Judge vitiates all other findings
    of fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been
    a valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

17. In all the circumstances, I remit this appeal for a  fresh  hearing  in
    the First-tier Tribunal and do so on the basis  that  this  is  a  case
    which falls squarely within the Senior President's  Practice  Statement
    at paragraph 7.2. The nature or extent of  any  judicial  fact  finding
    which is necessary for the decision in the appeal to be re-made is such
    that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal  with
    cases fairly and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I  find
    that it is appropriate to remit this appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal
    to determine the appeal afresh.

Decision

18. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the appeal to be decided afresh  in  the  First-
                    tier Tribunal at Taylor House.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order  pursuant  to  rule  13(1)  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure Rules 2014.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
pursuant to section 12(4)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011). I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be determined.
