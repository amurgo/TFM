Representation:
Appellant   Mr Parminder-Singh (Home Office Presenting Officer)
Respondent  In person


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The respondent in these proceedings was  the  appellant  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal. From hereon I have referred to the  parties  as
       they were in the First-tier Tribunal so that for  example  reference
       to the respondent is a reference to the Secretary of State  for  the
       Home Department.

    2. I do not make an anonymity order  under  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
       Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended).

    3. The appellant is a national of Ukraine. The  appellant  entered  the
       United Kingdom on an unknown date and was issued a residence card on
       October 15, 2010 based on her  marriage  to  an  EEA  national.  Her
       marriage to her husband was dissolved on February 25, 2013.

    4. On May 16, 2014 she applied for a residence card based on  the  fact
       she was the former spouse of an EEA national. The respondent refused
       her application on June 16, 2014. Her residence card was revoked  at
       the same time.

    5.  The  appellant  appealed  that  decision  on  July  1,  2014  under
       Regulation  26  of  the   Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
       Regulations 2006 and Section 82(1) of the  Nationality,  Immigration
       and Asylum Act 2002 and her appeal came before Judge of  the  First-
       tier Tribunal Shergill (hereinafter referred to as "the  Judge")  on
       April 5, 2016. In a decision promulgated on April 19, 2016 the Judge
       dismissed the appeal under the  2006  Regulations  but  allowed  her
       appeal on article 8 grounds.

    6. The respondent appealed the Judge's decision on April 29,  2016  and
       permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Lever on September 8, 2016.

    7. The matter came before me on the above date.

PRELIMINARY ISSUES

    8. As per the grounds of appeal I pointed  out  to  the  appellant  the
       decisions of Amirteymour and  others  (EEA  appeals;  human  rights)
       [2015] UKUT 00466 and TY (Sri Lanka) v SSHD  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  1233
       made it clear the Judge had no jurisdiction to deal with any article
       8 claim on an EEA application.

    9. In the circumstances I was left with no  option  but  to  allow  the
       respondent's appeal.

DECISION

   10. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve
       the making of an error on a point of law.

   11. The appellant has no right of appeal on human  rights  grounds.  The
       First-tier Tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. It erred
       in law in doing so.

   12. I set aside the decision  to  allow  the  appeal  and  substitute  a
       decision that there was no valid  human  rights  appeal  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal and I direct that no further steps be  taken  by
       the Tribunal.
