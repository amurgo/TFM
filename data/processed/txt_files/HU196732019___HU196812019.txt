                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal by the appellants against the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Adio, promulgated  on  14th  April  2020,  by  which  he
    dismissed the appellants' appeals against the respondent's  refusal  of
    their human rights claims.

 2. In essence, the  appellants'  claims  involved  the  following  issues:
    whether, as an adult couple, the refusal of their leave to  remain  and
    consequential return to their country of origin,  Nepal,  would  be  in
    breach of their rights to respect for their  family  and  private  life
    under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights ('ECHR')  by
    virtue of the time  spent  by  the  couple  in  the  UK  and  the  very
    significant obstacles to their integration in  Nepal,  because  of  the
    earthquake damage to that country and the  first  appellant's  lack  of
    progress in his UK studies as a result of the loss  of  his  sponsoring
    college's licence; and the second appellant's rights  under  article  3
    ECHR, by virtue of a 'severe obstructive sleep'  condition,  for  which
    she was being treated in the UK and for it was asserted that there  was
    no comparable  treatment  in  Nepal.   The  respondent  rejected  these
    claims and the appellants appealed that refusal.

The FtT's decision

 3. The appellants initially requested an oral hearing but then requested a
    decision on the papers.  It was clear from the decision  that  the  FtT
    had before him very limited papers (�[14]), having previously  directed
    that  all  evidence  be  sent  by  27th  March  2020.  The  appellants'
    solicitors sent a substantial bundle on  26th  March  2020,  which  was
    faxed on 26th March 2020 and also received by post by the  Tribunal  on
    30th March 2020, after the FtT considered the appeal on the papers,  on
    27th March 2020.  The FtT did not consider (because it was clear he did
    not have before him), the appellants'  documents.  Unsurprisingly,  the
    FtT dismissed the appeals on article 3 and 8  grounds  because  of  the
    lack of evidence (�[24], [25] and [27]).

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 4. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on 28th April  2020,  which  are
    essentially that the FtT erred in failing  to  consider  the  available
    evidence and apply the law to that evidence.

 5. First-tier Tribunal Judge Fisher granted permission on 1st June 2020 on
    all grounds.

Directions in the light of Covid-19 and concession by the respondent

 6. Upper Tribunal Judge L Smith issued  directions  on  6th  August  2020,
    indicating that in her provisional view, the questions of  whether  the
    FtT had erred in law and whether  his  decision  should  be  set  aside
    should be resolved  at  a  remote  hearing,  via  Skype  for  Business.
    Nevertheless, in light of the respondent's concession  on  26th  August
    2020 that the FtT's decision contained errors of law, on the basis that
    he failed to consider material evidence, such that the  FtT's  decision
    should be set aside, the parties agree that a hearing to  consider  the
    issue of an error of law is unnecessary and the FtT's decision  can  be
    set aside without the need for a hearing. Both parties also urged me to
    remit the appeal back to the First-tier Tribunal,  on  the  basis  that
    there had been no substantive consideration by a First-tier Tribunal of
    any of the evidence. In light of the concession, I  agree  that  it  is
    appropriate to decide the issues concerning an  error  of  law  on  the
    papers, without the need for a hearing.

Decision on error of law

 7. In light of the  respondent's  concession,  there  are  errors  in  the
    decision of Judge Adio and I must  set  it  aside.   I  do  so  without
    preservation of any finding  of  fact,  so  that  the  appeal  must  be
    considered afresh.  Therefore, the appellants' appeals succeed.

Disposal

 8. With reference to paragraph 7.2  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
    Statement, given that the First-tier Tribunal has not considered any of
    the appellants' evidence, this is a case where,  exceptionally,  it  is
    appropriate that the  remaking  is  remitted  back  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Directions to the First-tier Tribunal

 9. This appeal is remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  complete
    rehearing with no preserved findings of fact.

10. The remitted appeal shall not be heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Adio.

11. There are no anonymity directions.
