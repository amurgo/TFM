                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer in  Islamabad  against
    the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Hillis to  allow  the  appeal
    against the refusal of  Mrs  Tayyaba  Naseer's  application  for  entry
    clearance as the spouse of Mr Mohammad Ramzan. For ease of  exposition,
    I shall hereafter refer to the parties in accordance with their  status
    in the First-tier Tribunal; that is to say, I shall refer to Mrs Naseer
    as  'the  appellant'  and  to  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  as  'the
    respondent'.

Background

 2. The appellant made her application on  the  17th  September  2013.  She
    relied upon her husband's income as  a  self-employed  restaurateur  as
    evidence of her fulfilment of the financial requirements of Appendix FM
    of the Immigration Rules. The respondent refused  the  application,  in
    part, because the appellant had failed  to  submit  all  the  documents
    required by Appendix FM-SE of the Rules.  That  deficiency  appears  to
    have been rectified by the time of the hearing of the appeal. The other
    reason  why  the  respondent  refused  the  application  was  that  the
    appellant's gross  income  in  the  tax  year  preceding  the  date  of
    application (i.e.  between the 5th April 2012 and 4th April  2013)  was
    �15,670, whereas the required threshold under Appendix FM is �18,600.

The question of law raised by this appeal

 3. The question that I have to determine is  this:  what  is  the  correct
    accounting period for assessment of the annual gross income of a  self-
    employed person under Appendix FM-SE of the Rules?

 4. At paragraph 15  of  his  decision,  Judge  Hillis  recorded  that  the
    representatives at the hearing before him had agreed that, "the  period
    of 18th August 2012 to 17th August 2013 is a permissible period for the
    calculation of the Sponsor's income  before  tax".  Ms  Mair  helpfully
    explained to me of the basis upon which she had agreed  with  Mr  Smith
    (the respondent's Presenting Officer)  that  this  was  an  appropriate
    accounting period under  the  Immigration  Rules.  The  correctness  or
    otherwise  of  adopting  that  accounting  period  as  the  basis   for
    assessment is considered at  paragraph  6  (below).  However,  it  will
    suffice for now to say that the  judge  accepted  (as  do  I)  that  Mr
    Ramzan's gross annual income during that accounting period was �18,893.
    That amount exceeds  the  minimum  threshold  that  is  required  under
    Appendix FM as a pre-requisite for the granting of entry clearance.

 5. However, as I have previously noted, the accounting period  adopted  by
    the respondent was that of the tax year immediately preceding the  date
    of the application. This appeal therefore turns upon  the  question  of
    whether the judge erred in  law  by  adopting  a  different  accounting
    period and, if so, whether that error was material to  the  outcome  of
    the appeal.

Discussion

 6. Ms Mair informed me that the basis of assessment that  she  had  agreed
    with Mr Smith in the First-tier Tribunal was founded upon the following
    sub-paragraph of paragraph A.1 of Appendix FM-SE -

         Where this Appendix requires the  applicant  to  provide  specified
         evidence  relating  to  a  period  which  ends  with  the  date  of
         application, that evidence ... must be dated  no  earlier  than  28
         days before the date of application.

    However, that sub-paragraph is not concerned with defining the relevant
    accounting period. Rather, it is concerned with the permissible  limits
    of the dating of a specified document in circumstances where there is a
    requirement to provide evidence "relating to a period which  ends  with
    the date of application". As we shall see, that was not  a  requirement
    that was engaged by the facts of this appeal.

 7. Ms Mair nevertheless sought to persuade me that it was not open to  the
    respondent to  complain  that  the  judge  had  erred  by  adopting  an
    accounting period which had been agreed as appropriate  in  the  First-
    tier Tribunal. I disagree. Whilst fairness undoubtedly dictates that  a
    reasonable period of notice must be given  before  factual  concessions
    are withdrawn,  the  respondent  cannot  in  my  view  be  bound  by  a
    concession of law that was wrongly made. It is the overriding  duty  of
    the First-tier Tribunal to apply the law correctly and if, for whatever
    reason, it fails to do so, then either party is entitled  to  have  the
    matter put right by the Upper Tribunal.

 8. Thus, whilst he appears to have been led into to it  by  the  misguided
    efforts of the representatives to assist him, I am driven  to  conclude
    that the judge erred in law by taking a 12-month period that  ended  no
    more than 28 days before the date of the application as the  basis  for
    his assessment of the sponsor's gross income. The remaining question is
    whether that error was material to the outcome of the appeal

 9. Although it was not cited to me, the respondent's argument is supported
    by the decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  Hameed  (Appendix  FM  -
    financial year) [2014 UKUT 266 (IAC). The question of law in that  case
    was identical to that which is raised in the instant appeal. Thus,  the
    headnote to the decision reads -

         The financial year for purposes of Appendix FM is the tax year, not
         the year selected for accounting purposes.

10. However, the Tribunal did not  provide  any  analysis  or  reasons  for
    holding that this  was  the  legal  position.  Moreover,  as  with  the
    accounting period that was adopted by the FtT judge in this  case,  the
    Tribunal in Hameed appears to have based its decision upon a  paragraph
    of Appendix FM-SE that is concerned only with the nature  of  specified
    documents that must be submitted with the application as proof  of  the
    sponsor's gross income rather than upon the paragraph that defines  the
    basis of calculation. Thus, the  Tribunal  referred  to  the  following
    words that appear in paragraph 7 of Appendix FM-SE -

         The following documents for the last full financial year, or for
         the last two such years (where those documents show the necessary
         level of gross income as an average of those two years):

          a. annual self-assessment tax return to HMRC (a copy or print-
             out); and

          b. Statement of Account (SA 300 or SA302).

    It did not however refer to paragraph 13(e) of Appendix FM-SE, which in
    fact sets out the basis upon which the sponsor's gross annual income is
    to be calculated. This reads as follows:

         Where the person is self-employed, their gross annual  income  will
         be the total of their gross income from their  self-employment  ...
         in the last full financial year or an average of the last two  full
         financial years.

11.  Ms  Mair  submitted  two  dictionary   definitions   (from   'Business
    Directory.com' and the Macmillan Dictionary') of  the  term  'financial
    year'. The essence of each of them is that  'financial  year'  means  a
    period of 52 consecutive weeks - which may begin  on  any  day  of  the
    calendar year - at the end of which account books  are  closed,  profit
    and loss is computed, and financial reports are  prepared  for  filing.
    The Collin's Dictionary definition of the term  notes,  as  is  in  any
    event clear from the above definition, that the so-called 'tax year' is
    in reality nothing more  than  the  'financial  year'  adopted  by  Her
    Majesty's Government. Other businesses and organisations - as  well  as
    the governments of other nations - can and do  choose  quite  different
    dates for the commencement of their respective financial years.

12. The above proposition is illustrated by the printed page  from  the  UK
    Government's website,  entitled  "Accounting  periods  for  Corporation
    Tax", which Ms Mair provided in support  of  her  submission  that  Her
    Majesty's Revenue and Customs [HMRC] treats 'financial  year'  as  that
    selected by the taxpayer rather  than  that  of  the  Government.  This
    advises the taxpayer that "your financial year is the time  covered  by
    your annual accounts". It is thus clear that, at least for the purposes
    of  corporation  tax,  HMRC  are  concerned  with  the  taxpayer's  own
    financial year rather than that of the Government.

13. It is however unnecessary to refer to  external  sources  in  order  to
    conclude that paragraph 13(e) of the Appendix FM-SE is  concerned  with
    the sponsor's financial year rather than that of the Government. In  my
    view, the construction contended for by Ms Mairs is  one  that  accords
    with the ordinary and natural meaning of the words that  are  employed.
    Thus, the subjects of the sentence are the "self-employed  person"  and
    the "gross income from their self-employment". It seems to me to follow
    from this that the reference to 'financial year' must be to that of the
    self-employed person rather than to that of the  Government.  Moreover,
    there is considerable  force  in  Ms  Mairs'  submission  that  if  the
    draftsman had intended that the tax  year  should  form  the  basis  of
    assessment for the purpose of the Immigration Rules, then there  is  no
    reason why this could not have been stated  in  clear  and  unambiguous
    terms. I also accept Ms Mair's submission  that  there  is  no  obvious
    reason of public policy for the applicant to  submit  evidence  of  the
    sponsor's  gross  profits  from  self-employment  over  the  course  of
    anything other than his own financial year. After all,  the  basis  for
    assessment of profits in any tax year is that  of  the  taxpayer's  own
    financial year, and it is not immediately apparent to me why it  should
    be any different for immigration purposes.

14. I  therefore  hold  that  for  the  purposes  of  Appendix  FM-SE,  the
    'financial year' is the period selected by the taxpayer for  accounting
    purposes and not the tax year. As it is not disputed that the sponsor's
    gross annual income during the financial year ending on the  30th  June
    2013 (the sponsor's last full financial  year  preceding  the  date  of
    application) also exceeded the threshold of �18,600,  it  follows  that
    the judge's error in selecting a different period was not  material  to
    the outcome of the appeal.
