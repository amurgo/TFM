                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision of Judge P J Clarke
    made following a hearing at Birmingham on 30th May 21013.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of India born on 9th October 1985.  She came
    to the UK to study on 14th January 2007 and completed  her  Masters  in
    electronics from Staffordshire University in 2009.  She was then issued
    a post-study work visa which expired in 2011.

 3. The Appellant decided to pursue further studies at Kaplan Financial  as
    a chartered finance analyst but this did  not  work  out  well  and  in
    October 2012 and she was admitted to the London  School  of  Technology
    for a Level 7 Extended Diploma in Leadership and Management  in  Health
    and Social Care.  The course finishes in October 2014.

 4. She made an application on 28th September 2012 for leave to  remain  in
    the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student  Migrant  under  the  points-based
    system but was refused on 9th January 2013 on maintenance grounds.  She
    had to prove that she had the required maintenance fees of �1,600  plus
    course fees of �3,000 for  the  first  year  of  her  course.  She  was
    required to show that she was in possession of �1,600 for a consecutive
    28 day period from 25th August 2012 to 21st  September  2012.   Between
    25th  August  and  17th  September  her  balance  fell  to  �1,525.632.
    Accordingly her application was refused.

The Judge's Determination

 5. The judge stated that the Appellant had requested that  her  appeal  be
    dealt with on the papers and she  paid  the  appropriate  fee  of  �80.
    However her representatives wrote to the Tribunal on  13th  March  2013
    saying that the appeal had been listed for an oral hearing  at  Newport
    on 18th March 2013 and requesting that  it  be  transferred  to  Taylor
    House. On 18th March the Tribunal issued  a  notice  to  the  Appellant
    requiring a further fee of �60.

 6. The judge said that there appeared to have been no attempt to  pay  the
    �60 and he assumed that she no longer wished to have an  oral  hearing.
    He therefore proceeded to deal with the appeal  on  the  papers  before
    him. He found that the Appellant was not in  a  position  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and  he  considered  whether  the
    appeal ought to be allowed on Article 8  grounds.   He  considered  CBS
    (PBS available - Article 8) Brazil [2010] UKUT  305  but  distinguished
    the Appellant's case from the Appellant in CDS and dismissed the appeal
    on human rights grounds.



The Grounds of Application

 7. The Appellant sought permission to  appeal  on  the  grounds  that  the
    Appellant had in fact paid the additional �60  and  the  appeal  should
    have been listed for  an  oral  hearing.   Since  the  application  the
    Appellant had maintained a sufficient balance in her  account  and  she
    had spent a  substantial  amount  of  money  time  and  effort  on  her
    education.  She had never breached any Immigration Rule  and  submitted
    that the judo made an error in his assessment of Article 8.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted on Article 8  grounds  only  by  Judge
    Keene on 25th June 2013.

The Hearing

 9. Prior to the  hearing the Appellant produced evidence that she had paid
    the fee for an oral hearing on 22nd March 2013.  Miss Everett  accepted
    that the judge had therefore made a mistake of fact, albeit through  no
    fault of his own, and the Appellant had therefore been deprived  of  an
    oral  hearing for which she had paid.

10. The decision is set aside and must be remade.   It  would  appear  that
    there has been an administrative error on the part of the  Tribunal  in
    not recording that this appeal should have been   listed  for  an  oral
    hearing.

Remaking the decision

11. Mr Hassan confirmed that the Appellant was not in a  position  to  meet
    the requirements of the Rules but submitted that the appeal  should  be
    allowed on Article 8 grounds.  The facts of this matter  are  that  the
    Appellant's father died in November 2012,  having  been  ill  for  some
    time, and during the preceding period the Appellant's mother lost track
    of the moneys in the account and inadvertently withdrew more money than
    she should have done without realising the consequences it  would  have
    for her daughter.

12. He submitted that the Appellant had been here for six and a half  years
    had never relied on public funds and never  would  since  the  evidence
    showed that since that time the account had had  adequate  funds.   The
    Appellant had paid �3,000 to the college and she wished to be given the
    opportunity to complete her studies.

13. Miss Everett said that she had considerable sympathy for the  Appellant
    for the loss of her father and the effect which this had had on her but
    submitted that the removal decision  was  proportionate  and  that  the
    Appellant's case was distinguishable from that in CDS (Brazil) who  had
    succeeded because there had been a change in the  Rules  in  that  case
    which meant that the Appellant in that case, who had invested highly in
    her course, was no longer in a position to meet  the  requirements.  In
    this case the Appellant had not been  disadvantaged by any rule  change
    and was undertaking a course of a shorter duration and had  the  option
    of making an application from India to return to the UK to  finish  her
    studies.

Findings and Conclusions

14. It is common ground that the Appellant cannot succeed under the Rules.

15. With respect to Article 8, she has been   in  the  UK  since  2007  and
    clearly has established some private life here as a student and has  no
    doubt made friends and contacts here during the course of her studies.

16. The decision will interfere with her rights to continue her course  but
    is lawful since she cannot meet the requirements of the Rules and is in
    pursuit of a legitimate aim.

17. It is also proportionate.  The Appellant  has  built  up  private  life
    deserving of respect during her time in the UK but she was admitted for
    a temporary purpose which gives no right to any extension of  stay  and
    in the  expectation  that  she  will  return  to  the  country  of  her
    nationality.  She has not been disadvantaged by any action on the  part
    of the Respondent.  It is true that the unchallenged evidence  is  that
    her funds fell short by a small amount in difficult  circumstances  for
    the Appellant and due to matters entirely beyond her control.  That  in
    itself however does not establish that the decision to  remove  her  is
    unlawful.  She has completed the course for which  she  was  originally
    granted entry and if she wants to complete a second course she has  the
    opportunity of making an  application  for  entry  clearance  for  that
    purpose.

Decision

18. The original judge erred in law and his decision is set aside.   It  is
    remade as follows. The Appellant's appeal is dismissed under the  Rules
    and on Article 8 grounds.
