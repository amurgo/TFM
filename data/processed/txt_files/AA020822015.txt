For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1) This is an appeal with  permission  against  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Debra Clapham dismissing an appeal on asylum and human  rights
    grounds.

 2) The appellant was born on 31 March 1979 and is a national of Sri Lanka.
     In Sri Lanka she was married to a mechanic, who was recruited  by  the
    LTTE in 2007.  Initially her husband was only involved in transport but
    as the civil war escalated he was involved in transporting weapons  and
    planting landmines.  Towards the end of the war  in  2009  her  husband
    surrendered himself to the army and disclosed that he was involved with
    LTTE.  The army declared that any individual who had any ties with LTTE
    should make themselves known.  Accordingly  the  appellant  surrendered
    herself also.

 3) The appellant's husband was  placed  in  a  rehabilitation  camp.   The
    appellant and her three children were transported to a "welfare"  camp.
    In November 2009 the appellant was taken back to Jaffna but her husband
    was not released until 2012.  After his release her husband  went  back
    to work as a mechanic in Jaffna.  He was required to report every month
    to the authorities.  Towards the  end  of  November  2013  her  husband
    disappeared and he failed to report  to  the  authorities  in  December
    2013.  In early December intelligence officers came to the  appellant's
    house looking for her husband and accused her of hiding  him  when  she
    was unable to tell them of his  whereabouts.   She  was  taken  by  the
    authorities to a place called  Allara,  where  there  was  a  detention
    centre.  She was interrogated, beaten and tortured.  She was kept in  a
    cell for a week.  An employee at the detention centre took pity on  her
    and decided to help her in return for payment.  The appellant gave this
    employee her mother's telephone number and the employee  contacted  the
    appellant's parents to arrange a bribe.   This  employee  arranged  her
    escape on the night of 12 December.  She then spent a month in  Colombo
    while her parents arranged for an agent to take her from Sri Lanka with
    her children.

 4) It does not appear to have been disputed by  the  respondent  that  the
    appellant's husband was coerced to join the LTTE and that he was placed
    in a rehabilitation camp  at  the  end  of  the  civil  war  while  the
    appellant herself was placed in a welfare camp.  Having considered  the
    appellant's evidence the judge accepted that  the  appellant's  husband
    had disappeared as the  appellant  claimed.   The  judge  accepted  the
    appellant's  account  of  her   detention   following   her   husband's
    disappearance.  The judge had before her medical evidence  relating  to
    scars on the appellant and the  judge  accepted  that  the  appellant's
    scarring was caused while in detention in the manner which she claimed.
     The  judge  accepted  the  appellant's  account  of  her  escape  from
    detention but concluded that because of the manner  of  her  escape  by
    payment of a bribe it would be highly unlikely that she would be placed
    on any kind of "stop list".  The judge  concluded  that  the  appellant
    would not be at risk of persecution were she to return  to  Sri  Lanka.
    The appellant was  not  involved  in  any  activities  which  might  be
    regarded as destabilising the state.   The  authorities  in  Sri  Lanka
    worked on the basis of intelligence.  While  she  might  be  put  under
    surveillance this would not amount to a breach of the Convention or  of
    her human rights.  The appellant's parents appeared to be living in Sri
    Lanka along with her brother without any difficulties and the appellant
    had had recent contact with  them.   In  short,  therefore,  the  judge
    accepted the appellant's account of her experiences in  Sri  Lanka  but
    concluded that she would not be at risk of persecution or serious  harm
    on return.

 5) The application for  permission  to  appeal  sought  to  challenge  the
    judge's findings in respect of risk on return,  having  regard  to  the
    country guideline case of GJ and Others (post-civil war: returnees) Sri
    Lanka CG [2013] UKUT 00319.  Permission to appeal was granted  on  this
    basis.



Submissions

 6) In his submission before me Mr Ruddy  relied  on  the  grounds  of  the
    application for permission to appeal.   The  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had made positive credibility  findings.   The  appellant  had
    been detained in December 2013, 4� years after the war  was  over.   Mr
    Ruddy referred to  paragraph  339K  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  which
    relates to past persecution.  The appellant had  suffered  persecution,
    in which case good reason had to be shown why she would not be at  risk
    on return.  The judge had not  addressed  this  point,  notwithstanding
    that paragraph 339K had been relied upon in the submissions  on  behalf
    of the appellant.  Mr Ruddy submitted that  the  appellant's  case  was
    analogous to the case of GJ, in which it was said in  the  summary,  at
    paragraph (7)(a), that individuals who have, or who  are  perceived  to
    be, a threat to the integrity of Sri Lanka as a  single  state  because
    they are, or are perceived to have, a significant role in  relation  to
    post-conflict Tamil separatism within the diaspora and/or a renewal  of
    hostilities within Sri Lanka are at risk of persecution or serious harm
    on return.

 7) Mr Ruddy pointed out that the judge  found  at  paragraph  112  of  the
    decision that the appellant  did  not  have  a  political  or  military
    profile.  At paragraph 113 the  judge  referred  to  the  relevance  of
    family connections, referring to paragraph 325 of GJ.  Mr Ruddy pointed
    out that according to this paragraph, however,  "the  extent  of  which
    past links predict future adverse interest will always be fact specific
    ..."  Mr Ruddy pointed out that the appellant  was  detained,  tortured
    and persecuted because of her  husband's  involvement  with  the  LTTE.
    This was 4� years after the end of the  civil  war.   These  were  fact
    specific matters predicting future adverse  interest.    The  appellant
    had given evidence of what the authorities said  to  her  in  detention
    about her husband and about her knowledge of her  husband.   It  was  a
    question of the authorities' perception of the appellant.  She did  not
    know about her husband but the authorities thought  she  did.   It  was
    accepted  by  the  judge  that  the  appellant's  husband  had  planted
    landmines and transported weapons for the LTTE, and was  in  charge  of
    the transport division for the LTTE.  The appellant was thought to have
    information about him and she therefore fell within paragraph (7)(a) of
    the summary to GJ about those at risk.

 8) In a rule 24 notice of 2 June 2015 it was submitted on  behalf  of  the
    respondent that the judge had had regard to the country guideline  case
    of GJ and had applied it the facts of this case.  There was no material
    error of law in the judge's finding that the appellant would not be  at
    risk on return.

 9) For the respondent Mrs O'Brien submitted that  paragraph  339K  of  the
    Immigration Rules still required the judge to look at risk  on  return.
    This required an analysis.  Even  if  the  appellant  was  accepted  as
    credible, as the spouse of a member of LTTE she was not necessarily  at
    risk on return, even  if  she  had  had  difficulties  previously.   At
    paragraph 110-117 of the decision the judge dealt with the crux of  the
    matter.  This included the quotation from paragraph 325 of  GJ.   There
    must be a fact specific assessment having regard to  relevant  factors.
    At paragraph 114 of the decision the judge referred to  the  safety  of
    the appellant's family.  According to the appellant she stayed with her
    family  after  her  escape  from  detention  and  they   had   had   no
    difficulties.  The judge took this into account at paragraph 114 and it
    was an important factor.  Even when she was ill-treated  the  appellant
    had nothing to tell the authorities.  The fact that the  appellant  did
    not know anything  about  her  husband's  whereabouts  was  taken  into
    account in the findings by the judge at paragraph 115, where the  judge
    stated that the fact that the appellant was released on  payment  of  a
    bribe meant it was highly unlikely that she would be placed on  a  stop
    list.  She was not likely to be seen as a  destabilising  threat.   The
    treatment of the appellant had been abhorrent but it was not likely  to
    happen in the future.  There might  be  surveillance.   The  judge  had
    sufficiently considered risk.

10) I indicated to the parties that I was not satisfied  with  the  judge's
    reasoning in respect of the assessment of risk  on  return.   The  fact
    that the appellant had been detained in 2013 was  an  indication  of  a
    continuing risk to her notwithstanding the cessation of hostilities  in
    the civil war.  The judge had not had proper regard to  paragraph  339K
    of the  Immigration  Rules  in  relation  to  the  severe  mistreatment
    incurred by the appellant in detention, which  was  sufficient  in  its
    severity to be described as torture.

11) As all the evidence was available  by  way  of  the  judge's  findings,
    together with the country guideline case of GJ, I invited  the  parties
    to address me on the question of risk on return  with  a  view  to  re-
    making the decision.

12) Mrs O'Brien then made a submission on risk on return.   She  relied  on
    the reasons for refusal letter.  She acknowledged that it was a  finely
    balanced case because of the recent ill-treatment.

13) Mr Ruddy referred me to the appellant's statement, where  she  set  out
    what the authorities had said to her about her husband when she was  in
    detention.  This showed both why the authorities were interested in the
    appellant's husband and that  they  did  not  believe  the  appellant's
    denials of knowledge of his whereabouts.  If the authorities had access
    to sophisticated intelligence and surveillance why  was  the  appellant
    detained?  The judge had referred to the appellant's family  as  living
    safely in Sri Lanka but not to the appellant's husband's  family.   The
    key issue was the perception of the  authorities.   The  appellant  had
    indicated at interview (Q102) that she still believed her  husband  was
    involved in LTTE and was seeking to revive  LTTE.   The  appellant  had
    been intensively cross-examined at the hearing  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and the judge had accepted her evidence as credible.

Discussion

14) The proper approach to the assessment of risk on return on this  appeal
    is to be found in paragraph 339K.  This states that where a person  has
    already been subject to  persecution  or  serious  harm  this  will  be
    regarded as a serious indication of the  person's  well-found  fear  of
    persecution or real risk of suffering serious harm,  unless  there  are
    good reasons to consider that such persecution or serious harm will not
    be repeated.

15) The respondent's position, as set out at paragraph 48  of  the  refusal
    letter, was that being the spouse of an individual with  previous  LTTE
    membership  did  not  make  the  appellant  necessarily  of  particular
    interest to the Sri Lankan government.  There was no evidence that  the
    appellant was subject to an arrest warrant.  The appellant had  had  no
    LTTE involvement herself and she had no current political affiliations.
     The refusal letter did, however, refer to paragraph (3) of the summary
    of GJ, which states:

         "The government's present objective is to identify Tamil  activists
         in the diaspora  who  are  working  for  Tamil  separatism  and  to
         destabilise the unitary Sri Lankan  state  enshrined  in  Amendment
         6(1) to the Sri Lankan Constitution in 1983,  which  prohibits  the
         "violation of territorial integrity" as Sri Lanka.  Its focus is on
         preventing both (a) the resurgence of the LTTE or any similar Tamil
         separatist organisation and (b) the revival of the civil war within
         Sri Lanka."

16) Also quoted in the refusal letter was paragraph  (8)  of  the  summary,
    which states:

         "The Sri Lankan authorities' approach  is  based  on  sophisticated
         intelligence, both as to activities within Sri  Lanka  and  in  the
         diaspora.  The Sri Lankan authorities know  that  many  Sri  Lankan
         Tamils travelled abroad as economic migrants and also that everyone
         in the Northern Province had some level  of  involvement  with  the
         LTTE  during  the  civil  war.   In  post-conflict  Sri  Lanka,  an
         individual's past history will be relevant only to the extent  that
         it is perceived by the  Sri  Lankan  authorities  as  indicating  a
         present risk to the unitary Sri Lankan  state  or  the  Sri  Lankan
         government."

17) I consider it significant that the appellant's period of detention,  in
    which she was tortured, occurred towards the end of 2013,  whereas  the
    hearings in the case of GJ were held in the first  4  months  of  2013.
    From this it may be inferred that the appellant  was  persecuted  as  a
    part of the operations currently being carried out by  the  Sri  Lankan
    authorities and security forces in their intelligence  based  approach.
    The appellant's husband, it may also  be  inferred  from  this,  is  an
    individual still of interest to the authorities and he therefore  falls
    within category (7)(a) of those who are at risk of persecution  in  Sri
    Lanka.

18) When the appellant  was  detained  in  December  2013  the  authorities
    assumed the appellant was concealing information  about  her  husband's
    whereabouts.  It may be inferred from the circumstances of her  release
    that they were satisfied,  at  least  for  the  time  being,  that  the
    appellant had no information to given them.  It does  not  follow  from
    this, however, that the authorities would not use  similar  methods  on
    some future occasion in an  attempt  to  obtain  information  from  the
    appellant.  What was done to her once, as recently  as  December  2013,
    might be repeated.  Although the appellant  was  able  to  escape  from
    detention, she was left with numerous physical  scars  as  evidence  of
    severe mistreatment and torture.  It has not been  suggested  that  the
    appellant has any means of redress against the authorities in Sri Lanka
    in respect of this mistreatment.  The possibility  must  be  considered
    that were the appellant to return to Sri Lanka she might at any time be
    once again detained and subjected to mistreatment at least as severe as
    before in an attempt to extract information from her about her husband.
     This would not be the result of any involvement by  the  appellant  in
    political activities but would result from  her  perceived  association
    with her husband.  It is as a consequence of this association that  the
    Sri Lankan authorities detained the  appellant  in  December  2013  and
    while the appellant's husband remains of interest  to  the  authorities
    there is a real risk that the appellant will also be of interest.

19) This is in part where the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal erred in her
    reasoning.   She  concentrated  in  her  approach  on  the  appellant's
    activities  whereas  the  focus  should  have  been  on  the  perceived
    association between the appellant and her  husband.   Even  though  the
    appellant has no knowledge of her husband's whereabouts, she may at any
    time find herself being called upon to satisfy the Sri Lankan  security
    forces of this,  who  have  extreme  methods  at  their  disposal.   In
    addition, the judge  did  not  properly  approach  the  issue  of  past
    persecution in accordance with paragraph 339K.  The mistakes  made  buy
    the judge in considering risk on return amount to an error of law.

20) Taking a fact specific approach to the circumstances of this appeal,  I
    am satisfied that there is a real risk of persecution for the appellant
    were she to return to Sri Lanka.  This arises through the  authorities'
    perception of her association with her husband and his  involvement  in
    LTTE activities.  On this basis  her  appeal  will  succeed  on  asylum
    grounds.

Conclusions

21) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

22) I set aside the decision.

23) I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it.

Anonymity

24) The First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  an  order  for  anonymity.   No
    application for such an order has been made before  me  and  I  see  no
    reason of substance for making one.

Fee Award   Note: This is not part of the determination

No fee has been paid or is payable so no fee award is made.
