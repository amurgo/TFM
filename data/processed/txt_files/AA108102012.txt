                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant SR is a citizen of Sri Lanka and was born on 7 September
    1974.  On  15  November  2012,  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  his
    application on the basis that  key  elements  of  the  claim  were  not
    accepted, that the appellant was not entitled to asylum or humanitarian
    protection and that his return  to  Sri  Lanka  would  not  breach  his
    protected rights under Articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR.   The  appellant's
    appeal against that decision was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Morgan (the judge) in a determination promulgated on 22 February  2013.
    An application was made for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.
     Permission was granted on 22 April 2013.  Upper Tribunal Judge Freeman
    said the following:

         "At the fifth (regrettably un-numbered) preliminary  question,  the
         interviewer, having been told the Appellant was  taking  pills  for
         depression, which made him feel unfit for interview that day,  said
         this 'Unless you have exceptional reasons for not going ahead  with
         the  interview,  your  claim  for  asylum  may  result   in   being
         withdrawn'.  This is described in the renewed grounds of appeal  as
         'nothing short of outrageous': whether that comment, itself  rather
         immoderate  in  tone,  could  be  justified  may  be  questionable.
         However, while the interviewer would  almost  certainly  have  been
         justified in warning the appellant that, if he were  not  ready  to
         proceed with an interview within a reasonable time, then his  claim
         might be decided on whatever information was before  the  Secretary
         of State, the correctness or otherwise of the action he did take is
         arguable."

 2. The appellant's solicitors prepared a bundle for the hearing before the
    First-tier Tribunal, also relied upon before the Upper Tribunal.

Background

 3. The appellant is a Sri Lankan Tamil, originally from Point  Pedro.   He
    is married with two children.  He said that in 1995 he was recruited as
    a pharmacist in  the  Jaffa  region  of  Sri  Lanka  and  worked  as  a
    pharmacist following his training.  He joined  LTTE  during  the  peace
    talks in August 2004 and underwent military  training  with  them.   In
    September 2006 he was detained and ill-treated by the Sri  Lankan  army
    at Point Pedro army camp.   His  release  was  arranged  following  the
    payment of a bribe.  The appellant said he was detained again  in  2010
    in Vavuniya.  During detention he was tortured.  His  fingerprints  and
    photographs were taken  and  he  was  made  to  sign  a  confession  in
    Sinhalese.  He was released following the intervention  of  his  uncle,
    his MP and the EPDP.  Fearing for his  safety,  the  appellant's  uncle
    arranged his departure from Sri Lanka.

 4. The appellant said his wife had been visited on four occasions  between
    September 2011 and January 2012.  He said he feared that he was  wanted
    by the authorities and if returned faced a risk  of  ill-treatment  and
    torture similar to that which he had already suffered.

Did the First-tier Tribunal make an Error of Law?

 5. There was no skeleton argument. Ms Jegerajah relied upon the grounds in
    support of the application for permission to appeal which  argued  that
    the judge erred in the following respects:

Ground 1 - Unclear Findings

 6. Failed to make findings of fact on material parts  of  the  appellant's
    account and/or in failing to make clear what his  findings  were.   The
    judge referred to inconsistencies in the appellant's  claim,  concluded
    that he was unable to accept core features of the appellant's claim and
    expressly rejected the appellant's account of being detained  and  ill-
    treated  in  2010  or  that  the  authorities  were  looking  for  him.
    Nevertheless, at the end of paragraph �31 the judge said inter alia:

         "......  I  note  however  that  if   the   country   guidance   is
         significantly expanded, for example to include a risk category  for
         those who have spent time  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  have  any
         historical links to the LTTE, then the appellant will  be  entitled
         to make a fresh claim ......"

 7. Given the judge's comments set out above that he accepted the appellant
    had links with the LTTE,  despite  his  earlier  conclusion  that  core
    features of the appellant's claim were not accepted, there was doubt as
    to what the judge did in fact accept and what he rejected.

Ground 2 - Reliability of Interview Record

 8. Failed to consider the reliability of the contents of the interview  in
    light of the appellant's mental health at the time, bearing in mind the
    interview record at G39 and G40 of  the  respondent's  bundle  and  the
    judge's  comments  with  regard  to  the  same  at  �28  -  29  of  the
    determination.  Ms Jegerajah drew our attention to a document handed up
    at the hearing described as UKBA Detention Centre Rule  35.   It  is  a
    consent form signed by  the  appellant  and  a  doctor  whose  name  is
    illegible authorising release  of  medical  information  to  UKBA  with
    regard to the appellant's allegation of a special illness or  condition
    including a torture claim.  Ms Jegerajah submitted that the judge erred
    in failing to take that document dated 14  October  2012  into  account
    although she subsequently conceded after enquiries were  made  that  it
    was not before the judge at the hearing.

Ground 3 - Documentary Evidence and Witness Evidence

 9. Failed to address, consider or make findings  on  the  documentary  and
    oral evidence of witnesses that were before  him,  in  particular,  the
    report of Dr Martin, correspondence from the Mental  Health  Trust  and
    GP, correspondence from Freedom From  Torture,  report  of  Dr  Dhumad,
    consultant psychiatrist, report of country expert  Dr  Cris  Smith  and
    witness statements of two persons, both of whom had been recognised  as
    refugees by the respondent and who were  on  the  basis  of  their  own
    knowledge, able to confirm the appellant's involvement with the LTTE.

10. Further, the judge's assessment on risk on return contained a  material
    error in that he concluded at �31 the appellant would not be at risk as
    he was released from an "unofficial" detention, without any explanation
    as to what he meant by that.  In addition, the  judge  did  not  engage
    with any of the various risk factors identified in the country guidance
    case of TK.

The Submissions

11. Ms Jegerajah repeated her reliance on the grounds. She took us  to  the
    interview record in terms of the appellant's mental health and then  to
    the determination to see how the judge dealt  with  that  evidence  and
    asked us to conclude that  there  was  a  procedural  unfairness.   She
    identified the evidence before the judge, regarding which he  had  made
    no findings which we have out at �9 above.

12. As regards ground 1, Ms Ong submitted that given  the  judge's  adverse
    credibility findings, it was clear he  was  rejecting  the  appellant's
    account. As regards ground 2, Ms  Ong  submitted  that  the  judge  was
    cautious in what he said and had to operate with  what  he  had  before
    him.  As regards ground 3, Ms Ong conceded the judge did not deal  with
    all of the evidence before him but that it was not a material error.

Our Conclusions

13. We find all the grounds are made out.  As regards  ground  1,  we  find
    that the judge did err, in that he failed to make express findings with
    regard to the appellant's history and in particular with regard to  the
    appellant's links to the LTTE.  The judge's observation at �31 that the
    appellant would be entitled to  make  a  fresh  claim  if  the  country
    guidance was significantly expanded to include those with any  historic
    links to the LTTE was inconsistent with his finding that he was  unable
    to accept the core features of the claim.  We find ground 2 is made out
    in that the  judge  allowed  a  procedural  unfairness  to  infect  his
    decision.  The judge considered the manner in which the  interview  was
    conducted at �28 -  29.   He  referred  to  the  manner  in  which  the
    interview was  conducted  as  "unhelpful".   He  went  on  to  describe
    comments  made  by  the  interviewer  as  "very  unhelpful".   In  such
    circumstances, the judge had an obligation to consider the evidence  in
    terms of the Joint Presidential Guidance Note number 2 of 2010:  Child,
    Vulnerable Adult and Sensitive Appellant Guidance, which he  failed  to
    take into account.  As regards ground 3 Ms  Ong  conceded  the  judge's
    error but asked us to find that it was not material.  We  do  find  the
    error material.  In our  view,  there  was  significant  evidence  from
    various sources in respect of which the judge erred because  he  failed
    to engage with any of it.

14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contains  material  errors  of
    law. None of the findings are preserved. The decision  must  be  remade
    following a de novo hearing of a freshly constituted  Tribunal  of  the
    First-tier.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 45(4)(i) of the Asylum and  Immigration
Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005

The appellant is granted anonymity unless and  until  a  Tribunal  or  Court
otherwise directs.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify the appellant or any member of the  appellant's  family.
Failure to  comply  with  this  direction  could  lead  to  proceedings  for
contempt of Court.
