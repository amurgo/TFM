For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008
Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 1. The appellant is a citizen of  India.   A  decision  was  made  by  the
    respondent on or about 11 October 2013  to  make  a  deportation  order
    against him under Section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act  2007,  following
    his conviction on 4 September 2009 for  an  offence  of  conspiracy  to
    supply cocaine, for  which  he  received  a  sentence  of  nine  years'
    imprisonment.

 2. The appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision came before  a
    panel of the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT/Tribunal") consisting of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Pirotta and Mrs V. Street, a non-legal member.  The
    FtT dismissed the appellant's appeal.

 3. The further background to the appeal is that the appellant came to  the
    UK on 1 February 1975, when he was 6 years of age.  He  came  with  his
    mother and sister and they have all been granted  indefinite  leave  to
    remain.

 4. In  November  2002  the  appellant  was  convicted  of  an  offence  of
    conspiracy to supply class A drugs  and  two  offences  of  failing  to
    surrender  to  custody.   He  received  a  sentence  of  seven   years'
    imprisonment.  As a result of that conviction a decision  was  made  to
    make a deportation order against him.  The appellant  appealed  against
    that decision and his appeal was allowed on human rights grounds  after
    a hearing on 28 January 2008.

 5. It appears that the appellant  has  other  convictions,  arising  since
    1987, for offences of theft,  or  other  dishonesty  offences,  assault
    occasioning actual bodily harm and affray, he  having  apparently  been
    convicted  of  the  latter  offence  in  2007,  receiving  a  suspended
    sentence.

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The FtT's decision  can  be  summarised  in  the  following  way.   The
    Tribunal rehearsed the appellant's account which was that he had worked
    as a police informant and had submitted documentary  evidence  to  that
    effect.  His claim was that he had not been able to  participate  fully
    in his own defence during his criminal trial because he did not want to
    reveal himself to the co-defendants as a police informant for  fear  of
    reprisals.  His application for severance of  the  indictment  had  not
    been granted.  The appellant did not answer any police questions during
    interview, did not file a defence case statement or  give  evidence  at
    his trial.  The trial judge however, did not direct the jury that  they
    could draw adverse inferences against the appellant by  reason  of  his
    silence.  His application for permission to  appeal  to  the  Court  of
    Appeal against his conviction was refused.

 7. At [19] there is reference to the appellant having  pleaded  guilty  to
    drugs offences on a different indictment,  and  was  sentenced  to  two
    years' imprisonment to run  concurrently  with  the  sentence  of  nine
    years' imprisonment.

 8. The Tribunal referred to various  pieces  of  documentary  evidence  in
    relation to the appellant's involvement with the police in terms of the
    assistance that he gave to them, but including evidence to  the  effect
    that he was told that he was no longer  authorised  to  work  with  the
    police as an informant.  At [23] the FtT's  decision  states  that  the
    appellant was told that he would no longer be authorised to  work  with
    the police as an informant because he attempted  to  provide  selective
    pieces of information in order to maintain an insurance policy  against
    his own apparently disproportionate offending, which rendered  his  use
    no longer justified, necessary or proportionate.

 9. At [32] it is stated that the appellant's offending  had  increased  in
    gravity, culminating in the sentence of nine years'  imprisonment.   It
    was concluded at [34] that the appellant was using the police  and  his
    role as an informant for his own purposes, namely to try to succeed  in
    fighting the deportation order against him, in which he was successful,
    to obtain bail, and to get revenge against other criminals whom he felt
    had let him down over debts he had incurred to family  and  friends  in
    the operation of a nightclub  business.   In  the  same  paragraph  the
    Tribunal concluded that the appellant  had  always  intended,  and  was
    active in, trying to make money on deals with criminals, to cheat,  rob
    or defraud them of money, to obtain  illicit  drugs  or  other  illicit
    commodities  for  onward  sale,  or  to  benefit  himself   by   making
    connections between them for which he would be rewarded.

10. At [35] it is stated that the police did not pay  him  for  information
    and would not provide him funds to stake a financial  interest  in  the
    conspiracy to import drugs although the appellant had asked  for  those
    funds  in  order  to  gain  credibility  with  the  conspirators.   The
    documentary records showed that the appellant was advised by the police
    on several occasions that he had overstepped the mark in  participating
    as a conspirator rather than merely conveying  information,  which  the
    appellant apparently acknowledged that he had done, and  that  he  knew
    his actions amounted to conspiracy as he had  been  convicted  of  such
    offences  before.   A  covert  recording  transcript  shows  that   the
    appellant was actively inciting the conspiracy and his demands  on  the
    police reflect the active role he was taking, despite their advice  and
    warnings to him.

11. At [36] the Tribunal found that it was evident that  the  police  could
    not permit the appellant to become actively involved in the conspiracy;
    to become an  agent  provocateur.   The  Tribunal  concluded  that  the
    appellant had not established to the lower standard of proof  that  his
    criminal activity was  a  cover  for  his  informant  activities.   The
    Tribunal found that he took advantage of  the  police's  need  to  have
    information and  carried  on  offending  mistakenly  believing  he  was
    "untouchable" because the police were supporting him.

12. The phone records showed that the appellant continued contacting  those
    involved in the conspiracy for 18 weeks after the police ceased to  use
    him as an informant.

13. The Tribunal referred to the sentencing remarks of the trial judge,  at
    [38], stating that those sentencing remarks showed that the appellant:

         "... was a drug dealer in his own right,  running  his  own  little
         enterprise in the North East, sourcing drugs from two  of  the  co-
         defendants ... The basis of the sentence was his own drug  dealing,
         the Judge being satisfied on the evidence that  there  was  'scant'
         evidence of any real involvement in the main conspiracy to import."

14. The Tribunal found that the evidence showed that the appellant had been
    involved  in  separate  "deals"  with  other  defendants  for  his  own
    purposes, not on the basis of the "main" importation conspiracy because
    the evidence in that regard was scant.

15. At [40] the Tribunal concluded  that  the  appellant's  account  was  a
    device to attempt to "re-open his  trial",  without  all  the  evidence
    being available (to the FtT), in order to demonstrate that his  actions
    were innocent and that he was only involved because he was used by  the
    police handlers who he claimed abandoned him when he was on trial,  who
    did not support him against the prosecution or who  encouraged  him  to
    offend in order to prove his probity with the other conspirators.   The
    Tribunal found that it could not go behind the finding of guilt or  the
    basis of sentence which clearly indicated  that  the  evidence  in  the
    appellant's case was that he was  involved  with  others  in  obtaining
    drugs for his own distribution, although not largely  involved  in  the
    major conspiracy to buy drugs abroad.

16. The Tribunal concluded that the appellant had received a fair trial  at
    which he had had the opportunity to pursue his defence  as  he  wished.
    At [42] the FtT referred  to  the  appellant  having  admitted  in  his
    statements that he was complicit in conspiracies to supply  drugs,  and
    using his criminal connections to make money.  Furthermore, at [43]  it
    was noted that the appellant had admitted the further offence of  being
    involved in another offence of supply or  distribution  of  drugs  with
    another  individual,  for  which  he  was  sentenced  to   two   years'
    imprisonment concurrent.  He had also  admitted  having  taken  cocaine
    since the age of 20, having large debts which he could not repay, owing
    money to family and friends which he was trying to obtain in order that
    the club which was financed by loans raised against their  homes  would
    not be closed down and  their  homes  repossessed.   He  had  therefore
    admitted his motives, the criminal actions in which he was involved and
    the lengths to which he was prepared to go to protect  or  further  his
    own and his family's interests as he saw them.

17. At [44] the Tribunal concluded that the appellant  had  been  a  police
    informer and may  have  provided  information  on  several  crimes  and
    criminals.  Nevertheless, the Tribunal  stated  that  it  had  concerns
    about the  appellant's  own  criminal  activities  and  his  continuing
    attitudes to crime.

18. It was concluded that the matters advanced by the appellant in relation
    to his trial, conviction and sentence  did  not  amount  to  compelling
    reasons to outweigh the public interest in deportation.

19. Consideration  was  given  to  medical  evidence  in  relation  to  the
    appellant's suffering from epilepsy.  In summary, it was concluded that
    his health was not a basis upon which to allow the appeal under Article
    3 of the ECHR.

20. In terms of his marriage, it was concluded at [53] that  the  appellant
    had not established that his relationship with his wife was a 'genuine,
    durable relationship'.  The Tribunal found at [54]  that  the  evidence
    showed that the appellant is prepared to use people to further his  own
    purposes, referring to the appellant's previous claim to have been in a
    relationship with a different person in 2008 at  a  time  when  he  was
    indebted to that woman's mother who  had  mortgaged  her  own  home  to
    provide  the  appellant  with  funds  for  his  club.   Although   that
    relationship is said to have broken down in 2007, he  still  relied  on
    his relationship with her as his  fianc�e  in  the  2008  (deportation)
    proceedings.

21. Reference was made to the length of time that the appellant had been in
    the UK; since he was a child.  His wife was born in the  UK  and  is  a
    British citizen, having lived in the UK all her  life.   The  appellant
    had been raised in a household where his parents spoke Punjabi  and  he
    had a life-long knowledge of the language.  It was concluded that there
    was no reason why the appellant and his wife could not return to  India
    together, the Tribunal referring to other aspects of their lives in the
    UK  and  balancing  the  public   interest   against   their   personal
    circumstances.

22. At [66] it was concluded that the appellant had not  shown  that  there
    are "very  compelling  factors"  beyond  paragraphs  399  and  399A  to
    outweigh the public interest in deportation.

    The grounds and submissions

23. The grounds before me can be summarised as  follows.   It  is  asserted
    that the Tribunal made findings of fact which were not supported by the
    evidence in terms of the appellant having  been  involved  in  separate
    deals with other defendants for his own purposes and that he  had  been
    active in trying to make deals with other criminals, to cheat,  rob  or
    defraud them of money, obtain drugs  or  other  commodities  by  making
    connections with those other criminals for which he would be rewarded.

24. It is also asserted that the Tribunal had failed to  consider  evidence
    before it in relation to the appellant not having been able to take any
    active part in his criminal trial without disclosing  his  role  as  an
    informant, and his fear of reprisals.  As a result,  the  Tribunal  had
    come to the perverse conclusion that  by  not  answering  questions  in
    interview, providing no defence case statement and not giving  evidence
    at his trial, he had achieved the  objective  of  the  prosecution  not
    being able to show that he was largely involved in the main conspiracy,
    and he was not convicted on that basis.

25. Insofar as the Tribunal had speculated on matters in relation to  which
    there was no evidence, those matters ought to  have  been  put  to  the
    appellant in the interests of fairness.

26. So far as the human rights aspects of the appeal are concerned,  it  is
    asserted in the grounds that the Tribunal had failed to deal  with  the
    effect of the appellant's role as an informant on his criminality.

27. So far as his relationship with his wife is concerned, the Tribunal had
    failed to take into account the evidence that they had known each other
    nearly all their lives, but only became involved in the relationship in
    about 2006.  Furthermore, the Tribunal had failed to deal with  Article
    8 of the ECHR in an appropriately  structured  way  with  reference  to
    relevant authority.  Similarly, it had failed to deal with the  Article
    8 claim appropriately, by first considering the Immigration Rules,  and
    then moving on to Article 8 proper.

28. It was relevant that the appellant's wife was a British citizen, and it
    would not be reasonable to expect her to move to India.   In  addition,
    the appellant had been in the UK since the age of 6 and had  spent  all
    his formative years in the UK.  The Tribunal had failed  to  take  into
    account the decision in Maslov v Austria [2008] ECHR 546.

29. In submissions Mr Macdonald relied on those grounds but focused on  the
    question of the appellant's role as an informant and  the  impact  that
    that had in terms of the criminal trial.

30. It  was  submitted  that  the  appellant  had  provided  three  witness
    statements exploring in considerable detail his role as  an  informant.
    To some extent that was corroborated by phone records and the  FtT  had
    not given appropriate consideration to relevant documentary evidence or
    the appellant's own account.  It was submitted  that  at  all  material
    times the appellant had given his police handlers  ongoing  information
    with reference to the conspiracy for which he received  a  sentence  of
    nine years' imprisonment.  That involved a large  quantity  of  cocaine
    which it  was  intended  to  parachute  into  fields  in  the  UK  from
    aeroplanes.

31. The appellant had provided information in relation to the existence  of
    the conspiracy and various details, for example information  about  the
    change of vehicles by one of the co-conspirators.  He had also provided
    phone numbers.  His information had enabled the  police  to  "bug"  the
    vehicle.

32. The only evidence connecting the appellant to the conspiracy was in the
    transcript of a  meeting  held  in  the  vehicle  of  one  of  the  co-
    conspirators on 13 January 2011.  I was referred to that transcript  in
    detail,  with  Mr  Macdonald  highlighting  various  features  of   the
    transcript.  The appellant's witness statement had given an account  of
    that meeting in which the appellant said that  he  had  spoken  to  the
    police handlers before the meeting and immediately before he arrived at
    it, as well as afterwards.

33. I was referred to a schedule of phone calls for the same date,  of  the
    meeting with and the  various  contacts  between  the  police  and  the
    appellant.  It  was  submitted  that  there  is  no  reference  in  the
    Tribunal's decision to the appellant's evidence in  relation  to  those
    phone calls or to the schedule of calls itself.

34. It was submitted that without the appellant's evidence it is  at  least
    arguable that the police would not have been able to  take  the  action
    they did in relation to the conspiracy.  It was  also  clear  that  the
    police subsequently decided that they no longer  needed  the  appellant
    because they had managed to bug vehicles and obtain evidence  by  other
    means.  He was effectively abandoned by the  police.   The  appellant's
    request  for  funds  in  order  to  maintain  the  confidence  of   the
    conspirators was refused by a senior police officer.

35. It was accepted on behalf of the appellant that it was  not  legitimate
    to go behind the sentence that the appellant received.  His  conviction
    would also have to be accepted.  The appellant's defence solicitors  in
    the criminal case had provided a number of pages of redacted documents.
     Although the sentence received  by  the  appellant  was  the  starting
    point, the Tribunal's conclusions should have been mitigated by  reason
    of the appellant's involvement with the police.   It  has  always  been
    accepted that he was an informant.  Notwithstanding what  was  said  in
    the sentencing remarks, the Tribunal should  have  taken  into  account
    what the appellant had said in his witness statements.   There  was  no
    evidence before the Tribunal that the appellant was involved as a  drug
    dealer for his own ends.  The Tribunal was  wrong  to  refer  to  there
    having been a "main" conspiracy, there only having been one conspiracy.



36. In relation to the appellant's relationship with his wife, although the
    Tribunal had found that that relationship was not genuine and  that  it
    was a marriage of convenience, the prison visit schedule at page 22  of
    the bundle revealed that from January 2011 to January 2013 she had made
    185 visits to the appellant.  She was not able to visit  him  initially
    when he was in Birmingham Prison  because  she  was  a  prison  officer
    there.  That evidence was not considered by the Tribunal.

37. Mr Mills in submissions relied on the decision in  Secretary  of  State
    for the  Home  Department  v  HK  (Turkey)  [2010]  EWCA  Civ  583,  in
    particular at [28] and  [34]  in  terms  of  the  significance  of  the
    sentencing remarks.

38. It was submitted that the question  arises  as  to  what  the  FtT  was
    supposed  to  do.   There  was  a  conviction  and  sentence,  and  the
    appellant's appeal to the Court of Appeal was  unsuccessful.   Although
    it was apparently conceded on his behalf that it was not legitimate  to
    go behind the conviction and sentence, the tenor of the submissions  on
    his behalf was precisely that.

39. The Tribunal had found that there were no compelling circumstances with
    reference to the matters advanced in relation to  the  criminal  trial.
    Insofar as it was suggested that matters were not taken  into  account,
    it was clear that the Tribunal had  considered  the  appellant's  claim
    that he was an informant.  The Tribunal's conclusions were based on the
    sentencing remarks.  It may be the case that the  judge  sentenced  the
    appellant on the basis of information not known to  the  Tribunal,  but
    the sentencing judge clearly took  into  account  all  the  information
    before him.

40. At page 34 of the appellant's bundle is a copy of counsel's  advice  in
    relation to the appeal to the Court of Appeal against conviction.  From
    [6] it is clear that the judge was aware of  the  basis  on  which  the
    appellant was putting his case, that paragraph referring to a number of
    ex parte hearings before the trial judge.

41. In relation to the appellant's marriage, it is clear from [53] that the
    Tribunal did take into account  the  evidence  of  the  prison  visits.
    Despite that evidence, they were entitled to conclude that this was not
    a genuine relationship.

42. It is in any event hard to see how any error in that respect  could  be
    material.  The appellant received a sentence well  in  excess  of  four
    years and therefore he is not able to rely on paragraphs 399(a) or (b).
     He would need to show very compelling  circumstances  over  and  above
    those paragraphs.  It does not meet  that  threshold  to  say  that  he
    should not have been convicted.

43. As regards the  complaint  about  the  structure  of  the  decision  in
    relation to Article 8, the  deportation  Rules  are  a  complete  code.
    There was no need for a separate  balancing  exercise  in  relation  to
    Article 8.  There was no need for a 'second stage' consideration.

44. As regards reliance on the decision in Maslov, it was clear from R  (on
    the application of) Irfan Akpinar v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2014] EWCA Civ 937, that there had perhaps previously  been
    too much reliance on the decision  in  Maslov.   Lengthy  residence  is
    simply one factor to be taken into account  but  does  not  involve  an
    extra test that needs to be met.  At [62] the Tribunal had acknowledged
    the length of time the appellant had been in the UK.

45. In reply  Mr  Macdonald  reiterated  and  re-emphasised  the  arguments
    previously advanced.

    My conclusions

46. In order to put into context the decision of the FtT and the  arguments
    in relation to its decision, I start by  quoting  from  the  sentencing
    remarks as follows:

         "Your position is made undoubtedly worse, and more serious, by  the
         fact that you have already amassed a prison sentence of seven years
         for conspiracy to supply Class A drugs.  So there you are  -  seven
         years you got - you come out and you are at it again.  Clearly that
         was not long enough to deter you.

         You are a drug dealer in your own right.   It  is  quite  [obvious]
         from the transcripts that  you  have  your  own  little  enterprise
         running up in the North East, and  you  were  sourcing  drugs  from
         [...].  There is plenty of evidence for that proposition, and I  am
         quite satisfied that that is the basis of your conviction,  because
         in my view there is scant evidence of any real involvement with the
         importation - so that is the basis on which I will sentence you.

         Obviously, if I thought that the jury  had  convicted  you  on  the
         basis of an importation, it would be  a  lot  higher.   As  I  say,
         however, your position is made worse by  the  fact  that  the  last
         prison sentence of seven years did not seem to deter you.

         Having regard to what I know of you, from what  was  heard  on  the
         transcripts that were played to the jury, it may well  be  you  are
         not perhaps the most sophisticated of criminals, but at the end  of
         the day, a lengthy custodial sentence has to  be  imposed  in  your
         case, but because you  were  -  in  my  view  -  removed  from  the
         importation aspect, the sentence on you is nine years."

47. Although there is no reference in the judge's sentencing remarks to the
    appellant having been  an  informant,  it  is  evident  that  this  was
    information that was conveyed to the  trial  judge.   As  submitted  on
    behalf of the appellant, it was never  disputed  but  that  he  was  an
    informant.  However, as the FtT pointed out, the  documentary  evidence
    showed that the police decided that he could no longer be used by  them
    as an informant.  Counsel's advice on the merits of an  appeal  to  the
    Court of Appeal, disclosed in the appellant's bundle, reveals that  the
    sentencing judge was fully informed of that situation.

48. The FtT referred to the lack of evidence of the appellant's involvement
    in the "main" conspiracy to import drugs.  The Tribunal  is  criticised
    in the grounds of appeal on the basis that  the  indictment  charged  a
    conspiracy to import drugs, and that there was no "main"  charge,  only
    that charge.  In fact, the  trial  record  sheet  in  the  respondent's
    bundle revealed that the  appellant  was  convicted  of  conspiracy  to
    supply a controlled drug.  It is clear from the sentencing remarks that
    there was an importation element to the offence  which  the  sentencing
    judge found that the appellant had not been involved with.  The FtT was
    doing nothing more than reflecting the sentencing remarks which  stated
    that "there  is  scant  evidence  of  any  real  involvement  with  the
    importation" and that  if  he  had  been  convicted  on  the  basis  of
    importation the judge said his sentence would  be  a  lot  higher.   He
    repeated that the appellant was "removed from the importation  aspect".
    It is evident that the FtT in that respect was reflecting the basis  of
    sentence.

49. Furthermore, in describing the appellant at [38] as  "running  his  own
    little enterprise  in  the  North  East",  that  is  exactly  what  the
    sentencing judge said.  Furthermore, it  appears  from  [43]  that  the
    appellant had admitted a further  offence  of  being  involved  in  the
    supply or distribution of drugs on a subsequent occasion  with  another
    person.

50. The FtT referred in detail to the various aspects  of  the  documentary
    evidence put before it, including the phone logs and covert  recordings
    [34].  There is further reference to the phone records  at  [37].   The
    Tribunal made findings on the basis  of  the  evidence  before  it,  as
    disclosed in the documents to which detailed  reference  was  made,  as
    well as on the basis of  the  appellant's  witness  statements.   I  am
    satisfied that the Tribunal was entitled to take the view that  it  did
    in relation to the appellant's offending.

51. Even if, contrary to my view, it could be said that the  Tribunal  went
    beyond  what  was  disclosed  in  the  sentencing  remarks  or  in  the
    documentary evidence before it, the fact of  the  matter  is  that  the
    appellant was convicted of a serious offence  and  received  a  lengthy
    term of imprisonment.   What  the  Tribunal  said  at  [40]  about  the
    appellant's arguments being "a device to attempt to re-open his  trial"
    is entirely justified in my view.  Indeed, it is evident that what  the
    appellant sought to do before the FtT, and repeated in arguments before
    me, was to mitigate the consequences of his conviction and sentence, by
    seeking to minimise his involvement in the offence by  relying  on  the
    information that he at one stage gave to the police, and the  assertion
    that he was effectively abandoned  by  the  police  at  or  before  the
    criminal trial.

52. I am satisfied that the FtT was entirely correct to reject that attempt
    by the appellant to 'go behind' the conviction and  sentence,  and  its
    conclusions on the appellant's involvement so far as  relevant  to  the
    issue of the public interest, were justified.

53. It is  important  to  remember  the  terms  of  paragraph  398  of  the
    Immigration Rules which states as follows:

         "398.    Where a person claims  that  their  deportation  would  be
             contrary to the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the  Human
             Rights Convention, and

             (a)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
                  the public good and in the public  interest  because  they
                  have been convicted of an offence for which they have been
                  sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;

             (b)   the deportation of the person from the UK  is  conducive
                  to the public good and in the public interest because they
                  have been convicted of an offence for which they have been
                  sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than 4 years
                  but at least 12 months; or

             (c)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
                  the public good and in the public interest because, in the
                  view of the Secretary of State, their offending has caused
                  serious harm or they are a persistent offender who shows a
                  particular disregard for the law,

             the Secretary of State in assessing that claim  will  consider
             whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not, the
             public interest in deportation  will  only  be  outweighed  by
             other factors where there are  very  compelling  circumstances
             over and above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A"

54. I do not accept that the Tribunal  failed  to  take  into  account  the
    appellant's role as an informant.  It is plain from its  decision  that
    this was a significant matter that was given detailed consideration, as
    is clear from my summary of the FtT's decision.  To reiterate, at  [44]
    the Tribunal found that it was  satisfied  that  the  appellant  was  a
    police informant and may have provided information  on  several  crimes
    and criminals, assisted the police by providing  intelligence  for  the
    seizure of drugs and money, prosecuting other offenders for significant
    crimes including arson, the importation of counterfeit goods, and money
    laundering, and that he had even  provided  evidence  against  his  co-
    defendants.  Again, at [48]  it  was  stated  that  the  appellant  had
    established that he was a police informant.

55. In summary, I am not satisfied that there is any merit in the criticism
    made of the  FtT's  decision  in  its  assessment  of  the  appellant's
    criminality, which assessment is substantially reflected in the judge's
    sentencing remarks and the documentary evidence before the FtT.

56. So far as the appellant's relationship  with  his  wife  is  concerned,
    there was in my judgement a sustainable analysis of that  relationship.
    The Tribunal pointed out between [50] and [54] that the  appellant  had
    previously attempted to use a relationship with  someone  else  in  his
    previous deportation appeal.  At [53] the Tribunal concluded that there
    was no credible evidence of a relationship between  the  appellant  and
    his spouse before 2008, despite the claim that they had  been  together
    in a relationship since 2006.  The Tribunal noted  that  the  appellant
    had not named his spouse as his partner or fianc�e in his 2008  appeal,
    and she had not appeared as a witness in that case.

57. Contrary to the submissions made to me, it is clear from [53] that  the
    Tribunal took into account the visits to the appellant in prison  after
    he had been moved from HMP Birmingham.  However, it was also noted that
    there was no evidence of any other contact between them in any form and
    no reasons advanced as to why his wife did not leave her employment  in
    order to be able to see the appellant if there was  conflict  with  her
    prison work, albeit later she did transfer to another prison.

58. In any event, there was a reasoned  and  sustainable  analysis  of  the
    extent to which the appellant and  his  wife  could  together  live  in
    India, with reference to language, employability and their  ability  to
    establish themselves in India,  notwithstanding  that  the  appellant's
    wife is a British citizen.

59. Furthermore, as was pointed out on behalf of the respondent before  me,
    the appellant is not able to rely on paragraphs 399(a) or (b) in  terms
    of a relationship with a child or partner because of his sentence of at
    least four years' imprisonment.  Similarly, he is not able to  rely  on
    paragraph 399A for the same reason.  He therefore would  need  to  show
    that there were very compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those
    circumstances, to outweigh the public  interest  in  deportation.   The
    Tribunal concluded that the only other matter that could potentially be
    relevant in this respect is the argument in relation to his  conviction
    and sentence, but it rejected the contention  that  those  amounted  to
    such very compelling circumstances.

60. It is similarly not the case that the Tribunal left out of account  the
    length of time that the appellant had been in the UK. This was a matter
    that was expressly referred to on more than one occasion, including  at
    [57] and [62].

61. Despite the reliance on Maslov, the appellant was not able to establish
    that he met any of the exceptions to  deportation,  regardless  of  the
    length of time that he had been in the UK.  It  is  also  important  to
    bear in mind that his  recent  convictions  for  serious  offences  had
    occurred when he was an adult.

62. It may well be that the FtT's decision could have benefited from a more
    structured approach  to  consideration  of  the  extent  to  which  the
    appellant was able to  establish  an  exemption  to  deportation,  with
    reference to consideration of the Article 8 Rules  first,  but  in  the
    circumstances of this appeal any apparent lack of structure  is  in  no
    sense material.

63. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that it has been established that there
    is any error of law in the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Its
    decision to dismiss the appeal therefore stands.

    Decision

64. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point  of  law.   The  decision  to  dismiss  the  appeal
    therefore stands.
