Representation:

For the respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1. The appellant is a national of Jamaica. He married his sponsor, Mrs
      Marvalyn Sonia Logan, n�e Platt, in 2014. She is a British national
      originally from Jamaica. She has a 15-year-old son from a previous
      relationship. She works as a care worker.

   2. On 9 October 2015 he applied for entry clearance to join his wife. His
      application was refused on 26 January 2016. It was considered under
      Appendix FM and refused on suitability and financial grounds.

   3. On 10 November 2007 he had been convicted of selling drugs in America,
      sentenced to one year's imprisonment, and thereafter deported to
      Jamaica. The effect of this is was a 10-year prohibition from the date
      his sentence was served.

   4. His sponsor indicated she earned �23,886 per annum and so met the
      financial threshold. However, the evidence she provided was dated
      August 2015 and so not within the 28 days to the date of application
      as specified in the rules.

The First tier Tribunal

   5. The appellant's appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge PS Aujla
      on 12 June 2017 and in a decision promulgated on 15 June 2017 was
      dismissed. The judge concluded that the respondent properly applied
      the suitability requirements. Regarding the finances, this was not a
      situation involving the exercise of evidential flexibility. Rather,
      the evidence was not in accordance with the requirements of the rules
      and again the judge did not fault the respondent's refusal on this
      basis. The judge did not find any other compelling circumstances. At
      paragraph 30 the judge stated:

         `whilst I accept that it may not be reasonable to expect the
         sponsor to relocate to Jamaica, it is clear that she knew what she
         was letting herself into. She made a deliberate decision to enter
         into a relationship and marry a person who would not qualify for
         entry clearance to come to the United Kingdom on account of
         suitability. '

   6. The judge made the point that it was open to the appellant to reapply
      once the 10-year period elapsed. In the absence of any evidence of him
      being in custody before sentence or of a remission program in the
      United States the judge calculated his sentence would be served on its
      anniversary.

   7. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis it was arguable that the
      judge, having accepted it was not reasonable to expect his sponsor to
      relocate to Jamaica erred in law in concluding compelling
      circumstances did not exist when carrying out the proportionality
      exercise.

The Upper Tribunal

   8. The appellant's representative pointed out that the judge had accepted
      the relationship between the appellant and his sponsor was genuine and
      his sponsor had a dependent child.

   9. In response, the presenting officer referred me to paragraphs 82 and
      89 of SSHD -v- SS Congo et al [2015]EWCA Civ 387.Paragraph 82 refers
      to family life commencing when the ability for it to continue in the
      United Kingdom was precarious and Article 8 does not oblige a State to
      accommodate the preference of  individuals. In that case the issue was
      the minimum income requirement: the court found no compelling
      circumstances outside the rules, and that the proper course was to
      reapply with the necessary documentation. Para 82 states:

        This is a case in which the sponsor, a British citizen, wished to
        be joined by his foreign national wife to take up family life in
        the United Kingdom, rather than continuing it in her home country.
        It appears that the family life was commenced in circumstances
        where it was known to be precarious, if the couple wished it to be
        carried on in the United Kingdom. Moreover, there was nothing to
        prevent the husband from going to Pakistan to continue their family
        life there. Article 8 does not give rise to an obligation on the
        state to accommodate a preference to pursue family life in the
        United Kingdom rather than overseas. At the time of the refusal of
        LTE, the minimum income requirements in the Rules in respect of the
        sponsor were not satisfied. There were no compelling circumstances
        to require the grant of LTE outside the Rules. If the sponsor
        expected to be able to satisfy the minimum income and evidence
        requirements in the near future, the appropriate course was to wait
        and submit a properly supported application for LTE when the
        requirements in the Rules could be satisfied. There was nothing
        disproportionate in the Secretary of State applying the Rules
        according to their terms in this case.

  10. Paragraph 89 provides:

         The FTT also erred in saying that it would not be proportionate to
         expect FA to make a further application. Since FA's application
         failed to comply with the Immigration Rules and no compelling
         circumstances were identified why those Rules should not be applied
         in her case in the usual way, there was nothing disproportionate in
         applying the Rules in accordance with their terms, with the effect
         that FA's application failed and she would have to make a new one.
         The Entry Clearance Officer (and the FTT) was not required to waive
         the operation of the Rules as some sort of goodwill gesture because
         of the way in which FA's previous application had been dealt with.

  11. Mr Tufan said the decision had to be read with MM (Lebanon) [2014]
      EWCA Civ 985 which repeated that Article 8 did not impose a general
      obligation on a member State to facilitate the choice made by a
      married couple to reside in it. In R (on the application of Agyarko)
      (Appellant) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Respondent)
      [2017] UKSC 11 the Supreme Court found the rules compatible with
      Article 8 given the ability to grant leave where exceptional
      circumstances were established resulting in unjustifiably harsh
      consequences .The test was of proportionality - the reference to
      exceptional circumstances in the European case law means that in cases
      involving precarious family life, "something very compelling ... is
      required to outweigh the public interest", applying a proportionality
      test.

  12. The appellant's bundle contains a statement from the appellant. He
      makes the point that the drugs offence occurred in 2003 albeit his
      conviction was not until 2007. He says he was deported from America in
      2012. He said that when he made his application he told the respondent
      of his convictions. He said he is now rehabilitated. He referred to an
      updated letter from his wife's employer confirming she had been in
      employment since 2006. He also provided various P 60s.

  13. There is also a statement from his sponsor. She said she met her
      husband in Jamaica and they began a relationship before he went to
      live in America. She then came to the United Kingdom from Jamaica. In
      2009 they re-establish contact and their relationship began in 2012
      when he moved back to Jamaica. They were married in Jamaica in 2014.

  14. She states that whilst the employer's letter submitted was dated
      August 2015 her income is well over the required threshold. She says
      she worked for three agencies as a care worker. She explained the
      difficulties she had in obtaining documentation from her employer. She
      also refers to the public interest factors set out in section 117 B.
      There is also a letter from her dated 2 September 2015 to the British
      High Commission.

  15. There is a letter from her employer dated 18 April 2017, Care Outlook,
      stating she started work on 20 March 2006. There is also a letter from
      My Home Care dated 27 April 2017 confirming she began working for them
      on 15 March 2006. There is also letter stating the appellant has been
      a full-time health care assistant from 2014.

Consideration

  16. I remind myself that the issue in this appeal is whether there is a
      material error of law in the judge's decision. The issue is not
      whether I or another judge might have decided matters differently. It
      was accepted that the immigration rules were not met on two counts,
      the suitability and the financial evidence.

  17. The judge noted that the appeal was a deemed human rights appeal and
      was not an appeal under the rules. It is trite to say article 8 is not
      a general dispensing power and the rules are the prism through which
      the proportionality of the decision is to be considered.

  18. The judge set out the factual background which was undisputed. The
      competing arguments are set out. At para 29 the judge pondered whether
      there were compelling circumstances. The judge took into account the
      sponsor had a teenage son who was in contact with his father.

  19. The judge concluded it was not reasonable in the circumstance to
      expect the sponsor to go to Jamaica. Against this, the judge pointed
      out when she chose to marry in full awareness of the appellant's
      background and the immigration difficulties this presented. The judge
      did not find compelling circumstances and pointed out there remained
      the option of a fresh application. Consequently, the judge found the
      decision was proportionate.

  20. It was for the judge to consider the circumstances and to decide if
      the outcome was unjustifiably harsh. The judge's approach was correct
      and I do not find any material error of law established.

Decision.

No material error of law has been established in the decision of First-tier
Tribunal Judge Aujla.Consequently that decision dismissing the appeal shall
stand.
