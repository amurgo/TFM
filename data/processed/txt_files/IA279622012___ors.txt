                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction and immigration history

    1. The Secretary of State appeals  against  the  determination  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 26  February  2013  allowing  the
       appeals of Mr Ul-Haq, his wife and daughter,  against  her  decision
       made on 15 November 2012  to  refuse  Mr  Ul-Haq's  application  for
       indefinite leave to remain. For the sake  of  continuity,  we  shall
       refer to Mr Ul-Haq and his family as 'the appellants' and Mr Ul-Haq,
       in particular, as 'the appellant', as they were  in  the  First-tier
       Tribunal. Their appeals were allowed on Article 8 grounds.


    2. The appellants are citizens of Pakistan. Mr Ul-Haq was  born  on  31
       August 1983. On 13 January 2007 the appellant  was  granted  limited
       leave to enter the United Kingdom until 11 December 2011 as  a  Work
       Permit Holder. His wife  was  granted  leave  to  enter  the  United
       Kingdom on 3 October 2007 as his  spouse.   On  4  May  2009,  their
       daughter, R, was born in the United Kingdom and given limited  leave
       to remain in line with that of her parents. She is  now  four  years
       old.


    3. On 6 December 2011,  during  extant  leave,  the  appellants  sought
       indefinite  leave  to  remain  under  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
       decision of the Secretary of State made on 15 November 2012 fell  to
       be decided under  the  Immigration  Rules.  In  order  to  meet  the
       requirements for indefinite leave to remain  under  the  Rules,  the
       appellants had to satisfy the requirements  contained  in  paragraph
       134. If they did not, the applications had to be refused pursuant to
       paragraph 135. Paragraph 134 required, amongst  other  things,  that
       the applicant

         (vii)... does not have one or more unspent convictions  within  the
         meaning of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974

    4. The appellant did have such a conviction. On 1 April 2010 at Glasgow
       City Justice of the Peace Court, the  appellant  pleaded  guilty  to
       attempting to pervert the course of justice and was fined ï¿½70. Under
       the terms of the 1974 Act, the  conviction  will  not  become  spent
       until 1 April 2015. Accordingly, his application under the Rules was
       bound to fail.

The Judge's determination

    5. The Judge, however, found that the Rules permitted the  Tribunal  to
       exercise  a  discretion  and,  without  identifying  where  such   a
       discretion is to be found, (except to say that Parliament must  have
       intended the Tribunal to have one), allowed the  appeals  under  the
       Rules in the exercise of  her  discretion.   There  was  clearly  no
       warrant for the introduction of a discretionary power exercisable on
       the part of the Tribunal to depart from the Rules and the  mandatory
       effect of paragraph 135.  This amounts to an error  on  a  point  of
       law.


    6.  The Judge, perhaps sensing this was the weaker of the two  ways  in
       which  she  might  allow  the  appeals,  also  allowed  them   'more
       powerfully'  on  Article  8  grounds  in   paragraph   22   of   her
       determination on the basis that either private or  family  life  was
       engaged and that the interference with it would be disproportionate.
         (Indeed,  in  the  decision  forming   the   conclusion   of   the
       determination, the Judge restricts  her  decision  to  allowing  the
       appeals  under  Article  8  and  omits  allowing  them   under   the
       Immigration Rules as she found she was entitled to do in the body of
       the determination.)


The appellant's case

    7. Mr Shoaib submitted that the Judge had done all she was required  to
       do.   She  had  identified  the  5-stage  test  in  Razgar  and  had
       determined that there was no  public  interest  in  the  appellant's
       removal because it would result in a  disproportionate  effect  when
       balanced against the  public  interest  in  maintaining  immigration
       control.

Our analysis

    8. Removal will not prejudice the appellants' family life as  all  will
       be returned to Pakistan together.  There are no other family members
       in the United Kingdom.

The nature of the private life developed by the family

    9. Private life is that which has been developed  since  the  appellant
       entered the United Kingdom in January  2007,  significantly  shorter
       than any period that once permitted leave to remain on the basis  of
       long residence or pursuant to any other  relevant  policy  or  would
       normally be sufficient to  violate  an  individual's  human  rights.
       More significantly, the appellant had no expectation (legitimate  or
       otherwise) that he would be entitled to remain in the United Kingdom
       unless he satisfied the conditions for further leave  to  remain  at
       the time his application for further leave was decided.  He was  not
       entitled to assume the requirements of the Immigration  Rules  would
       remain unaltered.  He would have to meet the  requirements  of  such
       changes as might later be introduced, see Odelola v SSHD [2008] EWCA
       Civ 308.

   10. The private life developed by this family is unremarkable.  There is
       nothing in relation to the quality  of  the  links  that  they  have
       developed with the community in the United Kingdom that permits  any
       distinction to be drawn between them and  any  other  individual  or
       family who has enjoyed a temporary right to  remain  in  the  United
       Kingdom for a specific purpose, be it as a  student  or  as  a  work
       permit holder or in some other capacity.

   11. Such links as the appellant and his family have developed  with  the
       local community are, we  find,  the  same  as  the  links  that  any
       temporary resident will have  developed,  predicated  on  the  basis
       that, when leaves  expires,  the  family  must  return  unless  they
       establish a basis under the Rules for further leave to remain.

The private life of the couple's daughter

   12. There are no considerations in relation to R, the couple's daughter,
       aged 4, that  prevents  her  removal  with  her  parents.   She  was
       conceived in the United Kingdom when  the  parents  knew  they  were
       temporarily resident here.  She is not a British or  Union  citizen.
       She will have developed no appreciable private life; certainly  none
       that cannot be replicated with her parents in Pakistan.  It is  said
       that she only speaks English.  Whilst this might seem surprising, we
       may assume it to be true but it still does not provide a reason that
       prevents removal since there is no evidence that she cannot or  will
       not adapt on return to her own country.  Considerations of s. 55  of
       the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 which now provides
       that, in relation to immigration, the Secretary of State  must  make
       arrangements for ensuring that her functions "are discharged  having
       regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of  children
       who are in the United Kingdom" do  not  render  a  return  with  her
       parents unlawful.  Nor does a consideration, in accordance  with  ZH
       (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4, that the best interests of  R  must
       be a primary consideration because "the correct  starting  point  in
       considering the welfare and best interests of a young child would be
       that it is in the best interests of a child  to  live  with  and  be
       brought up by his or her parents, subject to any very strong contra-
       indication", according to paragraph 35 of  E-A  (Article  8  -  best
       interests of child) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00315 (IAC).  She is  in  no
       different position from many expatriates across the world who  spend
       a period of their children's childhood working  or  studying  abroad
       and then return home when the tour  of  duty  ends  or  studies  are
       completed.  None would argue they are prevented from returning  home
       because their children have spent 4 years in a different country  or
       culture.


   13. It is apparent from the foregoing that the  nature  of  the  private
       life on which the appellants relied in order to  assert  that  their
       removal was made unlawful has nothing in itself that  is  remarkable
       or raises considerations concerning health, education, the  presence
       of other family members, the time spent in  the  United  Kingdom  or
       links with the United Kingdom such that  severance  cannot  lawfully
       occur in the exercise of that due  balance  that  an  assessment  of
       proportionality requires.  We find this is a fact.  In  so  finding,
       we are neither creating nor applying a legal test, far less  a  test
       of exceptionality.

The Judge's approach

   14. The Judge's determination raises the question of how  a  prohibition
       against removal could be justified in private and family life terms.
        The answer is apparent from the decision.  It  is  clear  that  the
       Judge was not prepared to permit the application of the  Immigration
       Rules as they applied to this family.  She did not consider  that  a
       person who had received a fine of ï¿½70 and whose conviction  remained
       unspent should be prevented from enjoying the  benefits  that  would
       undoubtedly have accrued to the family if  the  conviction  had  not
       taken place.  There can be no doubt that the consequences  for  this
       family  are   serious,   perhaps,   draconian.    However,   similar
       consequences occur in many instances under  the  Immigration  Rules,
       and the Points Based System in particular, where the failure to meet
       specific requirements as  to  funds,  income,  an  English  language
       certificate, the period or type of  an  educational  course  or  the
       contents of a CAS letter prevent the applicant from  satisfying  the
       conditions for further leave.    In effect, the Judge set aside  the
       requirement  of  there  having  to  be  no  unspent  conviction  and
       disapplied it.  In doing so, she re-wrote the  requirements  of  the
       Immigration Rules, at least in relation to these appellants.

   15. It is not easy to see on what basis this was or could  be  justified
       lawfully.  There is nothing to suggest it was  rationalised  on  the
       basis that the conviction only had a few months to run before it was
       spent.  The conviction remains unspent until 1 April 2015 and had 2ï¿½
       years still to run at the date of decision in November  2012.   Were
       she to have done so, this would effectively amount to the Judge  re-
       writing the definition of an unspent  conviction  (which  under  the
       1974 Act operates for 5 years  in  the  case  of  most  fines).   It
       appears to be the case that the Judge simply thought that an offence
       meriting a ï¿½70 fine was too trivial to mete out such  an  effect  as
       the  deprivation  of  indefinite  leave  to  remain.   Were  this  a
       permissible approach, it would suggest the Tribunal is  entitled  to
       reach its own view as to the seriousness of an  unspent  conviction:
       ï¿½70 was too little to merit removal, but what of ï¿½700 or ï¿½7 million?
        Presumably, that is for the Judge to determine in the  exercise  of
       another discretion which contains no obvious boundaries.

   16. In paragraph 18 of  the  determination,  the  Judge  classifies  the
       offence as 'a minor traffic  offence'  suggesting  that  it  is  the
       triviality of the offence that merited a departure from the need  to
       meet the Immigration Rules.  Once again, however, this suggests that
       the Tribunal has the power to classify the offence by  its  type  in
       order to determine the proportionality of removal: traffic  offences
       do not merit removal but what of offences of theft or violence?


   17. In fact, the Judge was wrong in her classification.  The appellant's
       offence was not a traffic offence but an offence  of  attempting  to
       pervert the course of justice.  The appellant was fined ï¿½70 and this
       provides the true measure of its seriousness.  We do  not  know  the
       circumstances of the offence but assume it  was  in  the  nature  of
       giving false details when stopped in the  course  of  the  appellant
       driving, or being driven, in a motor-car.  We readily agree with the
       Judge that whatever the nature of the offence, it was not a  serious
       one, as reflected in the fine imposed.

   18. The reasoning of the Judge becomes clear  in  paragraph  22  of  the
       determination:

         "It is difficult to see how in all the circumstances it would be in
         the public interest  to  remove  this  family  from  the  UK.  Such
         interference would be grossly disproportionate  to  the  legitimate
         aim of the public end sought to  be  achieved,  namely  immigration
         control. To remove a person on such a minor  transgression  of  the
         law would amount to removal which is arbitrary and on a whim."

The error on a point of law

   19. We consider that, regrettably, the Judge was doing no less than  re-
       writing the Immigration Rules because she did not approve  of  them.
       We do not consider that this is permissible. We know that  there  is
       no such concept as a 'near miss', see Miah v SSHD  [2012]  EWCA  Civ
       261.  We understand  the  Judge's  concern  that  a  provision  that
       justifies removal on the basis of an  unspent  conviction  covers  a
       range of offences  that  spans  dropping  a  sweet  wrapper  on  the
       pavement at one end of the spectrum to  acts  of  terrorism  at  the
       other.  However, a challenge on the basis of the arbitrary nature of
       the  Rules  (as  the  Judge's  determination  expressly  identifies,
       'arbitrary and on a whim') is to challenge the  legislation  or  the
       Rules themselves.


   20. Whilst this may be possible before the Administrative Court,  it  is
       not permissible in  the  Tribunal.   In  any  event,  we  would  not
       necessarily regard it as perverse or irrational to require a  person
       who seeks further leave to remain  to  have  committed  no  criminal
       offences whilst in the United Kingdom.  Were the rule to  have  been
       drafted to exclude certain  types  of  offences,  the  same  problem
       arises as we have identified above, save  that  the  'tipping-point'
       alters.  The draconian effect occurs between the man fined  ï¿½99  and
       the man fined ï¿½101 if removal is linked to  a  fine  of  ï¿½100.   The
       simple rule becomes almost infinitely more  complex,  distinguishing
       between  types  of  offence,  types  of  punishment  and  levels  of
       punishment.


   21. Furthermore, there  is  a  discernible  movement  towards  attaching
       greater weight to the public interest, at  least  where  the  public
       interest is articulated in a detailed way  in  executive  policy  or
       Parliamentary legislation.  Thus, while in   MF  (Article  8  -  new
       rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT 00393 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal identified
       the weight to be attached to the Secretary of State's  view  of  the
       public interest articulated in  the  form  of  the  new  Immigration
       Rules, the Court of Appeal in SS (Nigeria) v SSHD  [2013]  EWCA  Civ
       550 (22 May 2013) stated, with reference to primary legislation  and
       in the context of automatic deportation pursuant to s.32 of  the  UK
       Borders Act 2007, that Parliament itself has identified  the  public
       interest there and the  weight  to  be  attributed  to  it  and  the
       Tribunal should attach great store to this.

   22. The Immigration Rules are not primary legislation but an  expression
       of policy,  albeit  presented  to  Parliament.   Nevertheless,  they
       identify  the  circumstances  in  which  the  Secretary   of   State
       differentiates between those  classes  of  individuals  entitled  to
       enter or remain in the United Kingdom and those who  are  not.   The
       Secretary of State has excluded the appellant as a member of a class
       from the right to obtain further  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
       Kingdom.  The Rule has not been struck down.  Suitable weight should
       properly attach to these considerations.  The decision to allow  the
       appellant's appeal on human rights grounds was  not  made  upon  the
       strength of the appellants' private or family  life  in  the  United
       Kingdom but by  emasculating  the  weight  to  be  attached  to  the
       Secretary of State's immigration policy as set out in paragraph  134
       of the  Immigration  Rules.   As  such,  the  Judge's  approach  was
       impermissible.


   23.  The  Tribunal  should  be  astute  to   distinguish   between   the
       proportionality  of  removal  where  there  is  a   disproportionate
       interference with the private and family  life  of  the  appellant's
       family and  where  the  challenge  to  the  removal  decision  is  a
       disguised challenge to the  Rules  themselves.   Whilst  the  public
       interest in the effective maintenance of  immigration  control  does
       not remain static but will vary  from  case  to  case,  a  principal
       source  of  the  public  interest  is  to  be  found  in  the  Rules
       themselves. So much is clear from what is said by the House of Lords
       in Huang v SSHD [2007] UKHL 11 at [20]:

         In an article 8 case where this question is reached,  the  ultimate
         question for the appellate immigration  authority  is  whether  the
         refusal of leave to enter or remain,  in  circumstances  where  the
         life of the family cannot reasonably  be  expected  to  be  enjoyed
         elsewhere, taking full account of all  considerations  weighing  in
         favour of the refusal, prejudices the family life of the  applicant
         in a manner sufficiently serious to  amount  to  a  breach  of  the
         fundamental right protected by article 8. If  the  answer  to  this
         question is affirmative, the refusal is unlawful and the  authority
         must so decide. It is not necessary that the appellate  immigration
         authority, directing itself  along  the  lines  indicated  in  this
         opinion, need ask in addition whether the  case  meets  a  test  of
         exceptionality. The suggestion  that  it  should  is  based  on  an
         observation of Lord Bingham in Razgar above, para 20. He was  there
         expressing an  expectation,  shared  with  the  Immigration  Appeal
         Tribunal, that the number of claimants not covered by the Rules and
         supplementary directions but entitled to succeed  under  article  8
         would be a very small minority. That is still his expectation.  But
         he was not purporting to lay down a legal test.


   24.  In SSHD v Hayat (Pakistan) [2012] EWCA Civ 1054, Elias LJ  said  of
       this passage at [76]


         "It would also be inconsistent with the observation of Lord Bingham
         in Huang v SSHD [2007] UKHL 11, paragraph 20 to the effect that  in
         practice it would be relatively rare for Article  8  claims  to  be
         sustained where  an  appellant  could  not  remain  in  the  UK  in
         accordance with the Immigration Rules themselves."

The error of law, setting-aside and remaking the decision

   25. A decision on Article 8 grounds favourable to an appellant who fails
       to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  cannot  be
       justified by undermining or marginalising the Secretary  of  State's
       expression of the public interest set out in the Immigration  Rules.
       The justification must be based on whether the decision amounts to a
       disproportionate interference with the private and  family  life  of
       the appellant.


   26. The Judge's determination failed to approach the appeal in this way.
        This was an error on a  point  of  law  requiring  us  to  set  her
       decision aside and to re-make it.


   27. The private and family life developed by the family  whilst  in  the
       United Kingdom since January 2007 was not, for the reasons  we  have
       identified in paragraphs 9 to 13 above, of  a  quality  such  as  to
       render removal disproportionate.





DECISION

         The Judge made an error on a point  of  law  and  we  substitute  a
         determination allowing the Secretary of State's appeal in the Upper
         Tribunal and dismissing the appeal of  Mr  Ul-Haq  and  his  family
         against the decision of the Secretary  of  State  to  refuse  their
         applications for indefinite leave to  remain  on  all  the  grounds
         advanced.
