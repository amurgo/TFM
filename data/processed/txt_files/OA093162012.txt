Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Shah of Taj Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who was born  on  19  February
    1981.  On 1  April  2012,  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  refused  his
    application for entry clearance as a spouse under para 281 of Statement
    of Changes in Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).

 2.  The  appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal   and   in   a
    determination promulgated on 7 February 2013  Judge  Whiting  dismissed
    the appellant's appeal.  On 15  April  2013,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Cruthers) granted the appellant  permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.

 3. The appellant's case was that he had married a British citizen,  Alibon
    Nessa who was born on 29  January  1991.   They  underwent  an  Islamic
    marriage ceremony on 5 July 2009 and subsequently obtained a Nikah Nama
    as evidence of the registration of their marriage in Bangladesh  on  29
    January 2012.

 4. In his decision, the Entry Clearance Officer did not  accept  that  the
    appellant and sponsor's marriage was a genuine one.  In  addition,  the
    ECO did not accept that the appellant would be able to maintain himself
    and the sponsor without recourse to public funds.  He  did  not  accept
    that the sponsor was employed as  she  claimed  by  a  restaurant,  the
    Bombay Blue in Nantgarw, Cardiff as a  secretary  earning  �185.59  per
    week.

 5. In the First-tier Tribunal, Judge Whiting accepted  that  the  parties'
    marriage was genuine and that matter is now not in dispute and  I  need
    say no more about it.  However, Judge Whiting did not accept  that  the
    appellant could meet the maintenance requirements and,  in  particular,
    he was not satisfied of the sponsor's employment  at  the  Bombay  Blue
    Restaurant.

 6. On 1 July 2013, the appeal  was  initially  listed  before  me.   In  a
    decision dated  5  July  2013,  I  concluded  that  Judge  Whiting  had
    materially erred in law in finding that the appellant had not  met  the
    maintenance requirement in para 281(v) of the Rules.  I set  aside  the
    decision and the appeal was relisted before me on 31 July 2013 in order
    to remake the decision under the Immigration Rules.

 7. At the hearing, Mr Richards, who represented the ECO accepted that  the
    only issue was whether the sponsor was employed as she claimed  at  the
    Bombay Blue Restaurant in Nantgarw.   He  accepted  that  if  that  was
    established then the appellant had met the maintenance  requirement  in
    the Rules.

 8. Mr Shah, who represented the  appellant  sought  permission  to  adduce
    further  evidence  contained  in  an  appeal  bundle  together  with  a
    supplementary statement of the sponsor dated 31 July 2013.  Mr Richards
    did not object to the admission of this evidence under rule  15(2A)  of
    the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI  2008/2698).   I
    admitted the evidence under rule 15(2A).

 9. The applicable Immigration Rule is para 281, and so far as relevant  to
    this appeal, provides in para 281(v) the requirement that:

         "the parties will be able to  maintain  themselves  and  dependants
         adequately without recourse to public funds ...".

10. The burden of proof is upon the appellant to establish on a balance  of
    probabilities that he met the requirements of the Rules at the date  of
    decision, namely 1 April 2012.

11. The sponsor gave oral evidence before  me.   She  adopted  her  witness
    statement which  was  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  also  her
    supplementary statement dated 31 July 2013 prepared for the purposes of
    this hearing.  The sponsor also briefly gave evidence-in-chief.

12. The sponsor's evidence is that she works at the Bombay Blue  Restaurant
    in Nantgarw as a  secretary.   She  told  me  that  her  work  involved
    paperwork and dealing with orders from the kitchen  for  supplies  each
    week and that she helped out "as and when needed" as a waitress in  the
    restaurant.  She told me that this was her first job  after  she  moved
    from London where she had been living with her parents  at  their  home
    when she was a student.  Her evidence before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    was that she started work on 2 May 2011 and was paid  "cash  in  hand".
    She told me that she had obtained the job on coming to live in  Cardiff
    with her uncle (Mr Karim) after he  had  told  her  that  there  was  a
    vacancy at the Bombay Blue Restaurant.  The evidence before the  First-
    tier Tribunal was that Mr Karim also worked at that restaurant which is
    owned by another uncle of  the  appellant,  Mr  Kalam.   The  sponsor's
    evidence is that she lives rent-free with her uncle, Mr Karim  and,  as
    she is family, she does not pay any rent.

13. Having given her evidence-in-chief, Mr Richards did  not  cross-examine
    the sponsor.  Her  evidence  is,  therefore,  not  challenged  in  this
    appeal.  I invited Mr Richards to indicate his position in relation  to
    the appeal.  He acknowledged that there was a "wealth of evidence" that
    the sponsor was employed as she claimed  and  he  made  no  submissions
    seeking to persuade me that the appeal should be dismissed.   In  these
    circumstances, I did not call upon Mr Shah.

14. I have no hesitation in accepting the evidence of the sponsor.  She was
    clearly, in my view,  a  truthfully  witness.   Her  evidence  was  not
    subject to challenge before me.  There is also supporting evidence that
    she is employed as she claims.  There are a number  of  photographs  at
    pages 37-42 of the bundle, clearly showing the Bombay  Blue  Restaurant
    with the sponsor serving customers and sitting  at  a  desk  which  the
    sponsor told me was her office.  In the appeal bundle that  was  before
    the First-tier Tribunal, there is a P60 form (at page 144) for the  tax
    year to 5 April 2012.  That is in the sponsor's name  with  the  Bombay
    Blue Restaurant as her employer, showing her annual income for that tax
    year as �8,045.24.  Further, there is a P60 form for the tax year to  5
    April 2013 showing that the sponsor earned �9,653.28  and  showing  the
    employer as being the "Bombay Blue (Wales)  Ltd"  at  the  restaurant's
    address in Nantgarw.

15. I was also provided at the  hearing  with  a  number  of  letters  from
    individuals who stated that they were  customers  at  the  Bombay  Blue
    Restaurant and knew the sponsor as  someone  who  worked  there.   This
    evidence is also not challenged and I see no basis  upon  which  I  can
    find it other than reliable in the light of all the  evidence  in  this
    appeal.

16. In addition, there are detailed bank statements (at pages 55-83) in the
    sponsor's name covering various periods between 8 November 2011  and  7
    June 2013, showing regular  cash  credits  around  �180  which  is  the
    sponsor's  claimed  weekly  income.   In  particular,  there  are  bank
    statements for a period covering 8 March 2012 to 5 April  2012  showing
    cash deposits around the date of decision.  In addition, at  pages  95-
    112 there are a number of payslips  in  the  sponsor's  name  with  the
    stated employer being "Bombay Blue (Wales)  Ltd"  covering  the  period
    September 2011 until January 2012.    There are also supporting letters
    from Ms Karim at pages  51B-52  of  the  bundle  and  from  a  firm  of
    chartered accountants, Ahmed & Co (at pages  49-50)  stating  that  the
    sponsor commenced employment for Bombay Blue on 2 May 2011  working  30
    hours a week with gross weekly wages of �185.70.

17. As Mr Richards candidly accepted,  there  is  a  wealth  of  supporting
    documentation that confirms the sponsor's own  evidence  that  she  has
    been employed by the Bombay Blue Restaurant since May  2011;  that  she
    was so employed at the date of decision and, indeed,  remains  employed
    there at the date of this hearing.

18. Having considered all the evidence, I am  satisfied  on  a  balance  of
    probabilities that the sponsor  is  employed  as  she  claims,  earning
    approximately �180 per week at the Bombay Blue Restaurant in  Nantgarw.



19. I am satisfied on the basis of that income that the appellant  met  the
    maintenance requirement in para 281(iv) of the Rules  at  the  date  of
    decision.

20. The appellant established  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  his
    marriage was a genuine and subsisting one and that the parties intended
    to live together permanently in the UK.  No other requirement  of  para
    281 being in  issue,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  appellant  met  (and
    continues to meet) all the requirements of para 281.

Decision

21. The appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules, namely para 281.

22. In the circumstances of this appeal, I direct that entry  clearance  be
    granted to the appellant under para 281.

                                                                     A Grubb
                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal
