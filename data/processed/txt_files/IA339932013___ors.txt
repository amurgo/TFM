Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr Lingajothy of Linga & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State but nonetheless for the purposes of this decision I  shall  refer
    to the parties as they were described before the  First  Tier  Tribunal
    that is the Secretary of State as the respondent.  The  appellants  are
    citizens of the Philippines born on 30 September 1975,  10  March  2006
    and 3 October 1975.  They made applications on human rights grounds  to
    the Secretary of State and those applications were refused on 19 August
    2013.  They appealed and  their  appeals  were  allowed  on  Article  8
    grounds by First-tier Tribunal Judge Saunders on 24 June 2014.

 2. He recorded that both the first and third appellants arrived in the  UK
    in 2002 and 2003 respectively with entry clearance as  visitors.   Both
    overstayed their visit visas and have remained in the UK without leave.
     They had a son, the second appellant, born to them in 2006.

 3. They applied on 26 September 2012 for indefinite leave to remain on the
    grounds of their son's long residence.  Judge  Saunders  accepted  that
    the second application who was 8ï¿½ years old at the date of hearing  was
    settled and flourishing in his primary school where he was in  year  3.
    He found that his external life as well as his  family  life  with  his
    parents were increasingly important with his development.

 4. An application for permission to appeal was sought by the Secretary  of
    State on the basis that the Tribunal failed to provide adequate reasons
    why  the  appellant's   circumstances   were   either   compelling   or
    exceptional.  The appellant had established family and private life  in
    the UK in the full knowledge of their precarious immigration status and
    had waited years before seeking to regularise that status.   The  first
    and third appellants still had ties in the  Philippines,  having  spent
    the majority of their lives there and were able to speak the  language.
    They socialise with the Filipino community that demonstrate they  still
    had cultural ties.

 5. In regards to the second appellant he submitted that he was still young
    enough to be able to adapt to life in the  Philippines  as  they  would
    have some understanding of the language and culture having been exposed
    to it by the parents.   That  child  had  yet  to  begin  in  secondary
    education and English was spoken and understood in the Philippines  and
    the second appellant would have the support of his parents to help  him
    adapt to life there.  The appellants have ties to the  Philippines  and
    it was not the UK's responsibility to provide education for the world.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted in the following terms:

         "It is arguable  that  an  error  of  law  has  been  made  in  the
         determination as the judge has not taken note of the guidance in EV
         (Philippines) & Others v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 874.  All points  may
         be argued."

The Hearing

 7. At the hearing Mr Tufan considered that the judge  had  possibly  mixed
    the two Rules  of  paragraph  276  and  Appendix  FM  together  whereby
    Appendix  FM  requires  seven  years'  residence  prior  to  making  an
    application.  This is not the case in respect of paragraph 276ADE(iv).

 8. Mr Lingajothy confirmed that at the First-tier Tribunal appeal  hearing
    the Home Office made a concession to the effect that  the  decision  in
    respect of the second appellant was withdrawn but this appeared to have
    been overridden by the judge.

 9. Nonetheless Mr Tufan referred to the case of EV (Philippines & Others v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 874, 26 June
    2014 whereby the UK could not provide medical treatment for  the  world
    and "so we cannot educate the world".

10. Mr Lingajothy stated that there was a concession made  by  Mr  Carroll,
    the Home Office Presenting Officer in  the  previous  hearing  in  open
    court and the second appellant had reached 7  years  residence  by  the
    time the decision had been made.  If the appellant satisfied  paragraph
    276ADE.   he also needed to satisfy paragraph FLTR to succeed under the
    Immigration Rules.  The judge had set out compelling circumstances  and
    there was  no  material  error  of  law.   EV  (Philippines)  could  be
    distinguished as those children were not born in the UK and  had  spent
    only twenty months here.  It was recorded that the appellants were  not
    intending to remain in the UK and there were  clear  findings  to  that
    effect.  The judge found it likely  to  be  destabilising  and  have  a
    distressing effect to uproot the child.

Conclusions

11. The judge appeared to have confused the provision under 276ADE(iv) with
    the requirements under Appendix FM.  However, the second appellant must
    have seven years'  residence  prior  to  making  an  application  under
    paragraph 276ADE(iv) and did not.  He was born in March  2006  and  the
    application was made in September 2012. He could not  comply  with  the
    Immigration rules under Appendix FM. Neither of his parents is  in  the
    UK with leave to enter or remain. And further to E-LTRP.2.2  the  child
    had not lived in the UK for 7 years prior to the application. It  would
    appear that there was a concession made by Mr Carroll the  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer at the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal on  the
    basis of paragraph 276 ADE and this was an error.

12. However because of the second appellant's length of residence the judge
    considered  there  to  be  an   arguable   case   warranting   separate
    consideration of proportionality of removal under Article 8 of the ECHR
    outside the Immigration Rules applying Gulshan (Article 8 - new rules -
    correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640 and R (on the application of Nagre) v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 720.

13. The judge made specific reference to Gulshan and the  correct  approach
    to  applying  the  rules  and  Article  8,  in  paragraph  10  of   his
    determination and although on the face of it the finding by the  judge,
    that there was an arguably good ground to consider the  matter  outside
    the rules, may be construed as  generous,  he  nevertheless  made  that
    finding within the determination and gave his reasoning overall.

14. The Judge quoted Azimi-Moayed and ors  (decisions  affecting  children;
    onward appeals) [2013] UKUT 197 (IAC) and  as  Mr  Tufan  pointed  this
    suggests that 7 years after the age of 4 years is the critical  period.
     The judge, however, was aware that the period after the age of  4  was
    significant.   Nonetheless  the  judge  did  take  into   account   the
    circumstances of  the  family,  that  they  had  been  self  sufficient
    financially and that as indicated by the case the  child  had  spent  a
    number of years in the country and had been educated  here.  The  judge
    was clear he did not consider it to be  a  'near  miss'  case  but  had
    regard to the factors regarding minor children. In particular the judge
    stated 'he is no longer a very young child' and this made reference  to
    the fact  that  the  decision  was  made  nearly  one  year  after  the
    application was made which was a relevant factor.

15. As Mr Lingajothy submitted EV (Philippines) can be distinguished on the
    basis that the child in this particular appeal was born in the  UK  and
    had lived over seven years in the UK by the date  of  decision  of  the
    respondent.

16. In EV (Philippines) those children had not been born in the UK and  had
    spent a very limited time in the UK prior to the application.   It  was
    not  challenged  that  the  first  and  third  appellant  were   in   a
    relationship and the judge made a finding that they did have  a  family
    life together and the second appellant had an established private  life
    in the UK as a minor child who had lived in the UK since birth and  for
    the first eight and a half years.

17. Although it can be seen from the face of the determination  that  there
    was limited consideration by the  judge  of  the  legitimate  aim  when
    considering the question of interference and proportionality, this  was
    not a matter challenged by the Secretary of State.

18. At paragraphs 14, 15 and 16 the  judge  made  findings  in  respect  of
    Section 55 and noted that the last four and a half years were  regarded
    to be significant in terms of the appellant's integration.

19. The judge found that the appellant was no longer a very young child and
    his best interests were to remain in the social and educational setting
    he had grown up in and allowed his  parents  appeals  accordingly.   He
    took into account the factors weighing against the parents.

20.  The  judge  considered  the  Secretary  of  State's  position  in  his
    determination at paragraph  18  and  considered  the  position  of  the
    parents and applied weight to the Rules in assessing the  circumstances
    of the appellants' private lives and  found  that  the  balance  tipped
    "just" in favour of the appellants.  Reading  the  determination  as  a
    whole I find that the judge has set out the arguably goods grounds.

21. In MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192  MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013]
    EWCA Civ 1192 the Court of Appeal rejected the notion that the test  of
    exceptionality was being reintroduced and the exceptional circumstances
    to be considered in the balancing exercise involve the application of a
    proportionality test as required by the Strasbourg jurisprudence.

22. I find  that  the  grounds  of  appeal  are  a  disagreement  with  the
    determination which might have been more  expansive  in  terms  of  its
    reasoning  and  but  nonetheless  I  find  on  the  basis   of   Shizad
    (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013] UKUT 00085 (IAC)

23. MM Lebanon and Others R on the Application of the  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2014] EW Civ  985  sets  out  that  where  the
    relevant group of Immigration rules are not considered to be a complete
    code then the proportionality test would be 'more at large' and  guided
    by Strasbourg law. This suggests that other factors might contribute to
    an analysis whereby a judge might proceed on the basis of  an  analysis
    outside the rules guided by Strasbourg law. In this case this  is  what
    the judge did.

24.  Within  the  determination  there  was  a  brief  explanation  of  the
    conclusions on the central issue and that those reasons do not need  to
    be extensive.  There was an adequacy of reasoning.  There is  no  error
    of law and the determination shall stand.
