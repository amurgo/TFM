                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                          MRS MELVINA ELFREDA GAGE
                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   First-tier Tribunal Judge Rimington allowed the respondent's appeal  to
    the extent that it should be referred to the Secretary of State  for  a
    lawful decision.

2.   The Secretary of State was granted permission  to  appeal  the  judge's
    decision because she complained that the judge erred  in  stating  that
    the Presenting Officer had agreed for the matter to be remitted back to
    her for further decision.  The Secretary of State has to date failed to
    submit Ms Laverack's (HOPO) record of proceedings despite  being  asked
    to do so on 27 August 2015 and 28 October 2015.

3.   Furthermore, as there has been no  agreement  between  the  parties  on
    this issue, I rule that the Secretary of  State  no  longer  wishes  to
    pursue her complaint and find that the  judge  correctly  recorded  the
    agreement between the parties at paragraph 10 of her decision.

4.   The judge's decision is to stand.  This matter is  to  be  remitted  to
    the Secretary of State for a lawful decision.
