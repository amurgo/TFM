                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   As long ago as May 2010 Miss  Gu,  then  aged  15,  applied  for  entry
    clearance to join her mother, Fu Li, with a view to settlement.  Mrs Fu
    was currently going through her 'probationary period' as  the  wife  of
    Fang Zhi-Wei, a British citizen whom she had  married  after  divorcing
    Miss Gu's father.  The latter had written to declare that he was giving
    up 'custody rights' to his daughter,  which  led  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer to suppose that he had hitherto been exercising  responsibility
    for his daughter's upbringing.  The ECO also noted that Mrs Fu had gone
    to the United Kingdom on a visit visa in  September  2001,  overstaying
    thereafter, and had only been back in China between September 2008  and
    October 2009.  He was not satisfied therefore that Mrs Fu had had 'sole
    responsibility' for her  daughter's  upbringing,  or  that  there  were
    serous and compelling family or  other  considerations  which  rendered
    Miss Gu's exclusion undesirable.  The application was  refused  on  3rd
    July 2010 under paragraph 301(i)(b) and (c) of the Immigration Rules.

2.   On 7th July 2011 an appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  came  before
    Judge Morrison, who heard oral evidence from Mrs  Fu,  Mr  Fang  and  a
    family friend, Mrs  Cui  Jian,  who  was  privy  to  Miss  Gu's  living
    arrangements before moving to this country herself in June  2010.   The
    factual background to the case is  set  out  at  paragraph  26  of  the
    determination and, as it is uncontentious, I shall not repeat it  here.
    What was still uncertain was, according to Judge Morrison, whether Miss
    Gu's father had contributed to her upbringing before he and her  mother
    were divorced, and how many other relatives were  on  the  scene  apart
    from Mrs Fu's mother and her sister, Miss Fu Min, who were said between
    them to have been responsible at different times  for  the  appellant's
    day-to-day care.  The judge  was  also  concerned  about  the  lack  of
    evidence that the sponsor had been paying the appellant's  school  fees
    and keeping in touch with the school about her progress, and about  how
    the appellant was maintained financially during the  long  period  when
    the sponsor was back in China, before returning to the UK with a spouse
    visa.

3.   In the end, Judge Morrison, having  alluded  earlier  to  Nmaju  [2000]
    EWCA Civ 505, confined himself to the period between Mrs Fu's return to
    the UK in October 2009 and the  date  of  decision  in  July  2010  for
    assessing whether the sponsor had exercised 'sole responsibility'.   He
    gave two reasons for holding that she had not, first because there  was
    no  evidence  of  any  direct  contact  between  the  sponsor  and  the
    appellant's school, and secondly because there was no evidence of  what
    arrangements Mrs Fu and Mr Fang had made for the appellant's  reception
    and future education in this country, if she were given leave to enter.
     Both reasons were addressed in the application for leave to appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal, but only the second  struck  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Chalkley, when granting leave, as arguably erroneous in law.

4.   When the appeal came before me today, I  took  the  view,  despite  the
    contention in the 'Rule 24 Response' that it was not  an  impermissible
    observation, that Judge Morrison had erred in law by expecting any more
    of  the  sponsor  than  that  she   should   have   demonstrated   sole
    responsibility.  That suitable arrangements should have been  made  for
    the child's care  in  the  United  Kingdom  is  a  requirement  of  the
    'exclusion undesirable' rule,  but  it  forms  no  part  of  the  'sole
    responsibility' rule to which Judge Morrison was confining himself.  As
    this was the second of only two reasons for dismissing  the  appeal,  I
    could not say that it was not a material error.

5.   I therefore proceeded to hear oral evidence from the sponsor, in  order
    to re-make the decision on the appeal.  Mr Fang and Mrs Cui  were  also
    in attendance, and adopted their statements.  In her evidence-in-chief,
    Mrs  Fu  clarified  that  her  ex-husband  had  contributed  to   their
    daughter's support before  the  divorce,  but  not  subsequently.   She
    explained how money was  made  available  during  the  two-year  period
    between March 2008 and March 2010, for which  documentary  evidence  of
    remittances had not been provided.  It was  her  sister,  Fu  Min,  who
    dealt directly with the appellant's school, but Mrs Fu insisted that it
    was her decisions which were transmitted through her sister.  In cross-
    examination, Mr Mullen  focused  on  the  details  of  the  appellant's
    schooling, how it was paid for and what interest the  sponsor  took  in
    her  daughter's  progress.   Mrs  Fu  outlined  the   rather   informal
    arrangements for cash payments and for monitoring progress through  her
    sister, who had taken over the day-to-day care of the  appellant  after
    her grandmother passed away.

6.   In his closing submissions, Mr Mullen expressed surprise  at  the  lack
    of documentary evidence that the sponsor  was  paying  the  appellant's
    school fees.  If payment was made in cash, one would  still  expect  to
    see receipts.  There were no specific examples of what the sponsor  had
    done about the appellant's poor grades, and it could be  inferred  that
    the sponsor was content to leave such matters to her mother and sister.
     She had not been making the major decisions in  her  daughter's  life.
    In response, Mr Brennan observed that there  may  not  have  been  many
    major decisions to take.  The main one was sending the appellant  to  a
    decent school and paying for it.  The evidence of Mrs Cui, who was  not
    a member of the family, showed that the sponsor  was  indeed  concerned
    about her daughter.

7.   In my view, the present  case  follows  a  very  familiar  pattern.   A
    mother goes abroad in the hope of economic betterment, leaving behind a
    child in the care of close relatives - not  because  she  feels  little
    attachment to the child, but in order to make money and so provide  for
    the child more advantageously than she could if she has stayed at home.
     Eventually, the mother achieves settlement in this country,  and  then
    applies for the child to join her.  But the 'sole responsibility'  rule
    must first be satisfied.  She must  show  that  she  has  not  'shared'
    responsibility with the relatives who were entrusted with  the  child's
    day-to-day care.

8.   In the instant case, I do not think the absence of  receipts  or  other
    documentary evidence means that the sponsor has not been paying for the
    appellant's education.  I believe her explanation that in  China,  cash
    in hand is a very acceptable form of payment.  Like Judge  Morrison,  I
    confine myself to the period between the sponsor's return to the UK and
    the decision on her daughter's application.  Both Mrs Fu  and  Mr  Fang
    were working during this period.  There is no reason  to  suppose  that
    the appellant was not supported by her mother before the money transfer
    of ï¿½2,000 dated 4th March 2010, which is in the Appellant's Bundle.  Mr
    Brennan makes a good point when he says that there may not be all  that
    many major decisions to take.  There may have  been  a  time  when  the
    appellant was not doing as well at school  as  her  mother  would  have
    liked, but she seems to have progressed satisfactorily in the end.  She
    is now nearly 19 years old, and at university.  There is no  reason  to
    suppose that the sponsor, by sending money and keeping  in  touch  with
    her mother and sister, did not take an active interest in  her  child's
    upbringing and did not take any major decisions that needed to be made.

9.   The inconsistencies in  the  sponsor's  evidence  which  exercised  the
    First-tier Tribunal ~ at what  point  the  appellant's  father  stopped
    making contributions, and how many other relatives were  on  the  scene
    apart from the appellant's aunt and grandmother  ~  are  of  peripheral
    importance, and do not undermine what seems to me a generally  credible
    account.  I do not think that her father's confirmation that he asserts
    no rights over the appellant can be taken to  mean  that  he  has  been
    sharing responsibility for her, as the  respondent  supposed.   All  in
    all, I am satisfied that, as at the date of the respondent's  decision,
    the  sponsor  had  been  exercising  'sole  responsibility'   for   the
    appellant, in the sense required by the Immigration Rules.

10.  As more than three years have gone by since the decision  under  appeal
    was notified, it is clearly appropriate that the  appellant  should  be
    issued with entry clearance without further delay.  At the time of  the
    application and decision, the sponsor had only limited leave  to  enter
    the United Kingdom, and so the appellant would only have been  eligible
    for limited leave herself at that  time.   Now  that  the  sponsor  has
    indefinite leave, it seems to me that indefinite leave to enter  should
    now be granted.



     DECISION

     The appeal is allowed, with a direction for entry clearance.
