Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Wells (Counsel) instructed by M & K Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appeal of Ms Arumaichaitram Selvaratnam, a citizen  of  Sri
    Lanka, against a determination of  First-tier  Tribunal  N  Lodge,  who
    heard the case on 22 September 2017.  In that determination  the  Judge
    refused an appeal against a decision by the respondent of 25 April 2017
    to refuse to issue her with a permanent residence card  under  the  EEA
    Regulations.  The reasons for refusal are contained in a letter  of  25
    April 2017.

2.   A number of grounds of appeal were presented against that decision  and
    we have been addressed today by Mr Wells for the appellant and Mr Duffy
    for the Secretary of State.

3.   It is said in the determination that it was agreed between the  parties
    that the only issue was whether the appellant was financially dependent
    on her EEA sponsor, who is her son-in-law.  Evidence was heard  to  the
    effect that the EEA sponsor did everything for her,  such  as  shopping
    and cleaning and that she lived with the EEA sponsor and his wife,  who
    is her daughter, as well as a number  of  children.   It  was  said  in
    evidence that she used her pension credit to buy clothes and  a  number
    of things for the children.  If  she  went  out  she  bought  food  for
    herself. All the evidence was to the same effect.   Her income from the
    state was her pension credit of ï¿½159.35 per week and she used  some  of
    that at least, it is not clear exactly how much, to help with household
    bills such as gas, electricity and water.

4.   The Judge found that the state pension credit is  a  minimum  level  of
    income provided by the state for those over 60 years of age,  fixed  at
    an amount which the government considers is  sufficient  to  enable  an
    individual to meet his or her essential needs.  He found that  she  did
    not use it to meet her essential needs because she chose to spend it on
    clothes and presents for her grandchildren, as well as giving some part
    of it to charity.  He found that in the absence of support from her EEA
    sponsor she could meet all her essential needs from her  state  pension
    credit, indicating that the very  essence  of  pension  credit  was  to
    provide a minimum level of income for those of the right age.

5.   It was submitted on her behalf that she would not be able  to  live  on
    her state pension credit because, for example, she would not be able to
    afford to pay for her accommodation but the Judge  indicated  that  she
    could pay her rent if  she  were  required  to  because  she  would  be
    entitled to claim housing benefit as state pension credit, it was said,
    is a passport for housing benefit.  In any event the  Judge  considered
    the case purely on the finances, as appeared to have been  agreed,  but
    did not adopt the holistic approach which, as is clear from  the  cases
    of Jia v Migrationsverket C-1/05 [2017] QB 545  and  Reyes  (EEA  Regs:
    dependency) [2013] UKUT 00314 (IAC), is the proper approach.

6.   The Judge in our opinion erred  in  law  through  not  considering  all
    aspects of the appellant's  life  with  her  daughter,  son-in-law  and
    grandchildren and focussing exclusively on her notional ability to move
    out and live on her own.  He speculated as to what she might  be  doing
    in the future rather than looking at what the situation was at the time
    and failed to consider what the effect of the benefit in kind was, that
    benefit being the fact that she was living in the house. That seems  to
    us to be a matter which is material in the circumstances.

7.   As was pointed out during the course of the debate, she is in  the  odd
    situation that she is entitled to pension credit, and if she is told to
    leave then the pension credit will cease and she  will  come  back  and
    become dependent again and the situation could become  something  of  a
    "yoyo". Be that as it may, however, we have decided that  there  is  an
    error of law in that the Judge did not consider the whole circumstances
    including the accommodation and has speculated as to what the  position
    might be rather than looking at the facts as they are.

8.   It is unnecessary for us to deal  with  the  other  ground  of  appeal,
    which relates to the question whether the rules in relation  to  direct
    family members are discriminatory as opposed to the rules for  extended
    family members.  That may be an argument for another day.

9.   In the circumstances, therefore, we find that  there  is  an  error  of
    law.  We set  aside  the  determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    Having considered all the evidence for ourselves we are satisfied  that
    the appellant does meet the terms of the Regulations and therefore  her
    original appeal is allowed.
