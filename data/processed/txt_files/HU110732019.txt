This is a decision on the papers without a hearing. Neither party  made  any
submissions on  the  question  whether  it  is  appropriate  for  the  Upper
Tribunal to decide the Issues (as identified at  para  5  below)  without  a
hearing. The documents described at para 4 below were submitted. A  face-to-
face hearing or a remote hearing was not  held  for  the  reasons  given  at
paras  6-18  below.  The  order  made  is  set  out  at   para   83   below.
(Administrative Instruction No. 2 from the Senior President  of  Tribunals).


Representation (by written submissions):
For the appellant:     Ms A Delbourgo, of Counsel, instructed  by  A.Vincent
Solicitors Ltd.
For the respondent:     Mr T Lindsay, Senior Presenting Officer.


                                  DECISION

 1. The appellant, a national of Nigeria born  on  17  June  1968,  appeals
    against a decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Rayner who, in a
    decision promulgated on 12 November 2019  following  a  hearing  on  21
    October 2019, dismissed his appeal on human rights grounds (Article  8)
    against a decision of the respondent of 14  June  2019  to  refuse  his
    application of 24 April 2019 for leave to remain on human right grounds
    (Article 8) as the partner of his wife, Mrs. Mercy Omojowho, a  British
    citizen (hereafter the "sponsor").


 2. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Foudy in a decision signed on 1 May 2020 and sent to the parties on  10
    June 2020.

 3. On 23 June 2020, the Upper Tribunal sent to the  parties  a  "Note  and
    Directions" issued by Upper Tribunal Judge Lindsley dated 22 June 2020.
    Para 1 of the "Note and Directions" stated that, in light of  the  need
    to take precautions against the spread of Covid-19, Judge Lindsley  had
    reached the provisional view, having reviewed the file  in  this  case,
    that it would be appropriate to determine questions (a) and (b) set out
    at para 1 of her "Note & Directions", reproduced at my para 5(i)(a) and
    (b) below,  without  a  hearing.  Judge  Lindsley  gave  the  following
    directions:

      (i)   Para 2 of the "Note  and  Directions"  issued  directions  which
        provided  for  the  party  who  had  sought  permission   to   make
        submissions in support of the assertion of an error of law  and  on
        the question  whether  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
        ("FtT") should be set aside if error of law is found, no later than
        14 days after the "Note and Directions" was sent  to  the  parties;
        for any other party to file and serve submissions in  response,  no
        later than 21 days after the "Note and Directions" was sent to  the
        parties; and, if such submissions in response were  made,  for  the
        party who sought permission to file a reply no later than  28  days
        after the "Note and Directions" was sent to the parties.

      (ii)  Para 3 of the "Note and Directions" stated that  any  party  who
        considered that despite the  foregoing  directions  a  hearing  was
        necessary to consider questions (a) and (b) may submit reasons  for
        that view no later than 21 days after the "Note and Directions" was
        sent to the parties.


 4. In response to the  "Note  and  Directions",  the  Upper  Tribunal  has
    received the following:

      (i)   on the appellant's behalf,  a  document  entitled:  "Appellant's
        skeleton argument" dated 2 July 2020 by Ms Delbourgo, submitted  by
        A. Vincent Solicitors Ltd, the appellant's representatives,  by  an
        email to the Upper Tribunal dated 2 July 2020 timed at 23:11 hours;

      (ii)  on the respondent's behalf, a document  entitled:  "Respondent's
        written submissions" dated 13 July 2020 by  Mr  Lindsay,  submitted
        under cover of an email to the Upper Tribunal dated  13  July  2020
        timed at 18:42 hours; and

      (iii) on the appellant's behalf, the following submitted by  an  email
        dated 20 July 2020 from A. Vincent  Solicitors  Ltd  to  the  Upper
        Tribunal timed at 18:30 hours:

            (a)  The sponsor's undated statement (hereafter  the  "sponsor's
           July 2020 statement") at para 1 of which she says  she  disputes
           in its entirety the respondent's written  submissions  dated  13
           July 2020.

            (b)  Copies of a Barclays bank statement for an account  in  the
           name of Mercy Venture Limited for the period from 23 May 2020 to
           22 June 2020.

            (c)  A document said to show communications between the  sponsor
           and her daughter, Precious, for the period from 19 March 2020 to
           17 July 2020.

            (d)  Various  photographs  of  a  young  lady  (presumably  Miss
           Precious),   young   children    (presumably    the    sponsor's
           grandchildren) and a man holding a baby.

The issues

 5. I have to decide the following issues (hereafter the "Issues"),

      (i)   whether it is appropriate  to  decide  the  following  questions
without a hearing:

            (a)  whether the decision of the Judge involved  the  making  of
           an error on a point of law; and

            (b)  if yes, whether the Judge's decision should be  set  aside.



      (ii)  If yes, whether the decision on the applicant's  appeal  against
        the respondent's decision should be re-made in the  Upper  Tribunal
        or whether the appeal should be remitted to the FtT.

Whether it is appropriate to proceed without a hearing

 6. Neither party has made any submissions on the question  whether  it  is
    appropriate for the Upper Tribunal to decide the Issues.

 7. I do not rely upon the mere fact that neither party has made  any  such
    submissions as a factor that justifies proceeding without a hearing.  I
    have considered the circumstances  for  myself  in  order  to  reach  a
    decision as to whether it is appropriate  for  the  Upper  Tribunal  to
    proceed to decide the Issues without a hearing.

 8. I am aware of, and take into account, the force of the points  made  in
    the dicta of the late Laws LJ at para 38 of Sengupta  v  Holmes  [2002]
    EWCA Civ 1104 to the effect, inter alia, that "oral argument is perhaps
    the most powerful force there is, in our legal process,  to  promote  a
    change of mind by a judge"; Keene LJ at para 47 of  Sengupta  v  Holmes
    concerning the impact that oral submissions may have on  the  decision-
    making process; paras 35 and 48 respectively of the judgments  of  Lord
    Bingham and of Lord Slynn in Smith v Parole Board [2005]  UKHL  1;  the
    dicta at para 17(3) of Wasif v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 82  concerning  the
    power of oral argument; the  dicta  in  the  decision  in  R  v  Sussex
    Justices, ex parte McCarthy [1924] 1 KB 256 to the effect that  justice
    must be done and be seen to be done; and the  dicta  at  para  8  of  R
    (Siddiqui) v Lord Chancellor and others [2019] EWCA  Civ  1040  to  the
    effect that it is an "undeniable fact that the oral  hearing  procedure
    lies at the heart of English civil procedure", to mention just a few of
    the cases in which we have received guidance from judges in the  higher
    courts concerning the importance of an oral hearing.

 9. I am aware of and have applied the guidance of  the  Supreme  Court  at
    para 2 of its judgment in Osborn and others v Parole Board [2013]  UKSC
    61.

10. In addition, I take into account the seriousness of the issues  in  the
    instant appeal for  the  appellant.  This  appeal  concerns  rights  of
    appellant and his wife, the sponsor, under Article 8 of the ECHR,  i.e.
    matters of some importance as are many  decisions  in  the  immigration
    field. There was also evidence before Judge Rayner that the sponsor has
    two grandchildren who are infants.

11. I have considered  all  the  circumstances  very  carefully  and  taken
    everything into account, including the overriding objective.

12. Whilst I acknowledge that the Tribunal is now listing  some  cases  for
    face-to-face hearings and using technology to hold hearings remotely in
    other cases where it is appropriate to do so, the fact is  that  it  is
    not possible to accommodate all cases in  one  of  these  ways  without
    undue delay to all cases.

13. Of course, it is impermissible, in my view, to proceed to decide a case
    without a hearing if that course of  action  would  be  unfair  in  the
    particular case. If it would be unfair to proceed to decide  an  appeal
    without a hearing, it would be unfair to do so even if there would be a
    lengthy delay in order to hold a hearing face-to-face  or  remotely  or
    even if there is a consequent delay on other  cases  being  heard.  The
    need to be fair cannot be sacrificed.

14.  There  are  cases  that  can  fairly  be  decided  without  a  hearing
    notwithstanding that the outcome of the decision may not be  in  favour
    of the party  who  is  the  appellant.  In  the  present  unprecedented
    circumstances brought about by the coronavirus pandemic, it is my  duty
    to identify those cases that can fairly be decided without a hearing.

15. Taking a preliminary view at the initial stage of deciding  whether  it
    is appropriate and just to decide  the  Issues  without  a  hearing,  I
    considered the Judge's decision, the grounds and the submissions before
    me. I was of the view, taken provisionally at this  stage,  that  there
    was nothing complicated at all in the assessment of the Issues  in  the
    instant  case.  I  kept  the  matter   under   review   throughout   my
    deliberations.

16.  No  issues  arose  regarding  the  Issues  during  the  course  of  my
    deliberations that I would have asked the parties to address  if  there
    had been a hearing, whether a face-to-face hearing or a remote hearing.



17. At the conclusion of my deliberations, I was affirmed in the view I had
    taken on a preliminary basis, that it was  appropriate  to  decide  the
    Issues without a hearing.

18. Having considered the matter with anxious scrutiny, taken into  account
    the overriding  objective  and  the  guidance  in  the  relevant  cases
    including in particular Osborn and others v Parole Board,  I  concluded
    that it is appropriate, fair and just for me to exercise my  discretion
    and proceed to decide the Issues without a  hearing,  for  the  reasons
    given in this decision.

Questions (a) and (b) - whether the Judge  erred  in  law  and  whether  her
decision should be set aside

Background

19. The appellant last entered the United  Kingdom  on  8  May  2011  as  a
    visitor with leave to remain until 21 January 2016.[pic]

20. On 5 February 2016, i.e. 15 days after his leave  expired,  he  applied
    for further leave to remain  which  was  refused  on  6  May  2016.  He
    appealed against that refusal. His appeal was dismissed by Judge of the
    First-tier Tribunal G Clarke in a decision promulgated on 19 July  2018
    following a hearing on 8 June 2018.

21. The appellant's applications for leave to appeal against that  decision
    were refused by the First-tier Tribunal on 15 August 2018  and  by  the
    Upper Tribunal on 14 November 2018.

22. The appellant then made his application for leave to remain of 24 April
    2019, which the respondent refused in the decision dated 14  June  2019
    which is the subject of this appeal.

23. At para 18 of his decision, Judge Rayner made certain findings which he
    said were uncontested and which set out  further  relevant  background.
    Para 18 reads:

        "18.     I incorporate the chronology and background above into  my
            findings  of  fact.  I  [pic]make  the  following   uncontested
            findings:


           (i)   [The appellant] married in Nigeria on 17  June  2000,  and
                was divorced in Nigeria on 10 February 2011: page 75 AB.


           (ii)  [The sponsor] is a 57-year-old British  citizen.  She  was
                married on 12 [pic]March 1988 to Mr Gabriel Ochuko Omojowho.
                There are four children of [pic]that marriage, all  of  whom
                are UK citizens and living in the United Kingdom.  They  are
                aged between 31 and 21 years of age. The  marriage  [pic]was
                dissolved on 25 April 2015.


           (iii) [The appellant] and  [the  sponsor]  met  in  April  2014,
                started to live together in August 2014  and  married  on  9
                January 2016. At all  relevant  times  [the  appellant]  had
                limited leave to remain in the United  Kingdom.  That  leave
                expired on 21 January 2016.[pic]


           (iv)  The Home Office accepts that the relationship between [the
                appellant] and [the sponsor] is genuine  and  subsisting.  I
                unhesitatingly endorse that assessment. The  nature  of  the
                relationship  is  supported  by  objective  evidence.  Their
                witness  statements  reveal   a   genuine   and   subsisting
                commitment to each other.


           (v)   At all material times [the sponsor] has worked as a nurse.
                The refusal letter acknowledges that [the sponsor] meets the
                financial eligibility requirements of  Appendix  FM  to  the
                Immigration  Rules.  It  is  apparent  from  the   documents
                provided that  she  surpasses  the  �18,600  annual  minimum
                income threshold by some margin.


           (vi)  [The applicant's] previous human  rights  application  for
                leave to remain was made on 5 February 2016,  shortly  after
                his leave to remain had expired on 21 January 2016.[pic]


           (vii) [The appellant] became appeal rights exhausted in November
                2018, after his application for  permission  to  appeal  was
                refused by the Upper Tribunal. His current  application  was
                made on 24 April 2019, by which time he was  an  overstayer.
                He  therefore  does  not  satisfy  the  immigration   status
                eligibility requirements of Appendix FM to  the  Immigration
                Rules.


            (viii)       [The  appellant]  acknowledges  that   he   cannot
                demonstrate that he has an English  Language  qualification.
                He was prepared to take a test  but  was  unable  to  do  so
                because the Home Office had retained his passport, which  he
                needed  as  identification  for  the   test   centre.   [The
                appellant] and his representatives are critical of the  Home
                Office  for  this.  However,  it  makes   little   practical
                difference to [the appellant]'s legal position, as he  would
                have to satisfy EX. 1 to  Appendix  FM  to  the  Immigration
                Rules in any event, as he did not  satisfy  the  immigration
                status eligibility requirements.[pic]"


24. As para 18(ii) of Judge Rayner's decision states, the sponsor has  four
    children, i.e. a son named Neil (date of birth: 8 May 1988), a daughter
    named Amy (date of birth 14 February 1991), a son named Glen  (date  of
    birth 10 January 1994) and her daughter, Precious  (date  of  birth  16
    October 1998).

25. When the appellant made his application of 5 February 2016 for leave to
    remain, Miss Precious was aged 17 years. By the  date  of  the  hearing
    before Judge Clarke, she was over 19 years of age.

Judge Clarke's decision

26. Insofar as relevant to the grounds of appeal against  the  decision  of
    Judge Rayner, Judge Clarke found, in summary, as follows:

      (i)   The appellant was not the parent of a  child  under  18  and  he
        could not therefore succeed under the parent route of  Appendix  FM
        (para 23 of Judge Clarke's decision).

    (ii)    Para EX.1. of Appendix FM did not apply  because  Judge  Clarke
        found that there were no insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life
        continuing between the appellant and the  sponsor  in  Nigeria.  In
        this regard, Judge Clarke found, in summary as follows:


      (a)   The sponsor "... last saw her son Neil in the  latter  part  of
             2014 and her son Glen in 2016" (para 30).


      (b)   Judge Clarke did not find that there was  anything  exceptional
             about the relationship between the sponsor and  Miss  Precious
             beyond the normal emotional [pic]ties between adult relations;
             that the sponsor had some direct contact  with  Miss  Precious
             but it was not frequent; that  the  face-to-face  contact  was
             once every couple of months; taken at its height, most of  the
             contact was by telephone; and that the sponsor would  be  able
             to maintain contact with Miss Precious  by  telephone  if  she
             moved to Nigeria with the appellant and returned to the United
             Kingdom for visits with her daughter (para 31).


      (c)   The appellant and the sponsor both had family in Nigeria.  They
             could derive emotional and practical support from their family
             in Nigeria. The appellant's evidence that the sponsor supports
             four siblings in Nigeria suggests that she is  close  to  them
             (para 33). Judge Clarke placed weight on  the  fact  that  the
             sponsor had Nigerian heritage and had returned to  Nigeria  on
             occasions, the most recent visit being in 2015 (para 34).  The
             appellant and the sponsor were both of  working  age  and  had
             skills that  were  easily  transferable.  The  appellant  sold
             clothes. The sponsor had trained as a teacher in  Nigeria  and
             has worked as a nurse in the United Kingdom (para 35).


      (iii) The appellant did not meet the requirements  of  para  276ADE(1)
        of the Immigration Rules. In relation to  para  276ADE(1)(vi),  the
        appellant would not experience very significant  obstacles  to  his
        reintegration in Nigeria. Judge Clarke gave his  reasons  for  this
        finding at paras 40-46 of his decision.

      (iv)  Judge Clarke then considered the  appellant's  Article  8  claim
        outside the Immigration Rules, taking into account, inter alia, his
        findings in relation to the appellant's  family  life  and  private
        life claims under the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules.  He
        found that the decision was proportionate, giving  his  reasons  at
        paras 48-68.

Judge Rayner's decision

27. It was accepted before  Judge  Rayner  that  the  appellant  could  not
    satisfy  the  immigration  requirements   or   the   English   language
    requirements of Appendix FM and therefore he could only  qualify  under
    Appendix FM if he can show that paragraph  EX.1  applies  (para  19  of
    Judge Rayner's decision). Accordingly, as Judge Clarke had before  him,
    Judge Rayner considered whether there were very  significant  obstacles
    to family life continuing between the  appellant  and  the  sponsor  in
    Nigeria.

28. Judge Rayner noted (at paras 22, 23 and 25) that, unlike  the  position
    in the appeal before  Judge  Clarke,  neither  the  appellant  nor  the
    sponsor had in the appeal before him (Judge  Rayner)  relied  upon  the
    sponsor's relationship with any of her  four  children  including  Miss
    Precious, to assert that there were insurmountable obstacles to  family
    life between the appellant and the sponsor continuing in  Nigeria.  The
    relevant parts of paras 22, 23 and 25 read:

        "22.     Neither [the appellant] nor [the sponsor]  place  reliance
             on [the sponsor's] relationship with  her  adult  children  in
             respect of this claim, although Mrs  [pic]Omojowho  stated  in
             her evidence that she wanted to be with her four children  and
             two grandchildren, all of whom are in the United Kingdom.


        23.      In fairness to [the appellant]  and  [the  sponsor],  they
             make no claim that because  of  [the  sponsor's]  relationship
             with her children they should be permitted to stay.  No  doubt
             [the sponsor's] relationship with her adult  children  is  not
             what she would hope, and that is to be regretted. However,  it
             is also clear that the relationship cannot carry any weight in
             determining whether there would be 'insurmountable  obstacles'
             to [the appellant] returning to Nigeria,  and,  if  necessary,
             [the sponsor] accompanying her [sic].


        25.      ... [Judge Clarke] was dealing  with  precisely  the  same
             issue, albeit [the appellant] did not on this occasion seek to
             rely on the relationship between [the sponsor] and Precious as
             creating an 'insurmountable obstacle' to him and [the sponsor]
             continuing their family life outside of the United Kingdom.  I
             must and do give considerable weight to the findings of First-
             tier [pic]Tribunal Judge Clarke."


29. Ms Delbourgo, who represented the appellant before Judge Rayner, sought
    to persuade Judge Rayner that the issues considered in the  applicant's
    previous appeal were different and that this would be a ground for  not
    following Judge Clarke's decision or his findings of fact. Judge Rayner
    dealt with this submission at paras 24 and 25 where he said:

            "24. Ms Delbourgo submitted that the  previous  application  and
             appeal had focussed exclusively or mainly on  the  relationship
             between [the sponsor] and Precious, and that would be a  ground
             for not following First tier Tribunal Judge  Clarke's  decision
             or his findings of  fact.  I  do  not  agree.  Paragraph  6  of
             [pic]Tribunal Judge Clarke's determination, quoted at paragraph
             20 above, makes it clear that he was dealing not only with  the
             relationship between [sponsor] and Precious, but primarily with
             [the  appellant's]  family  life  and  relationship  with  [the
             sponsor], and  her  relationship  with  Precious  was  just  an
             element of [the appellant's] family life. Tribunal Judge Clarke
             was plainly dealing with the whole of EX. 1, which he quotes in
             full at paragraph 24 of his  determination.  Having  considered
             the  relationship  between  [the  sponsor]  and  her  children,
             Tribunal Judge Clarke makes the following  findings  about  the
             relationship between [the appellant] and [the sponsor], as well
             as  whether  there  were  'insurmountable  obstacles'  to  [the
             appellant] and  [the  sponsor]  continuing  their  family  life
             outside of the United Kingdom: ...

            25.  No arguable error on a point of law was found by the First-
             tier or Upper Tribunal in First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Clarke's
             determination, which was promulgated fewer than 18  months  ago
             in July 2018. I do not accept Ms  Delbourgo's  submission  that
             the previous Tribunal Judge was dealing with a different  issue
             from me. He was dealing with precisely the same  issue,  albeit
             [the appellant] did not on this occasion seek to  rely  on  the
             relationship between [the sponsor] and Precious as creating  an
             'insurmountable obstacle' to him and [the  sponsor]  continuing
             their family life outside of the United Kingdom. I must and  do
             give  considerable  weight  to  the  findings   of   First-tier
             [pic]Tribunal Judge Clarke."

30. Judge Rayner said, at para 21 of his decision, that his starting  point
    was the decision of Judge Clarke. He considered the decision  of  Judge
    Clarke and the evidence before him. He made the following findings:

      (i)   There were no insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  being
        enjoyed between the appellant and the sponsor in  Nigeria,  stating
        at para 26:

             "26.  I  have  considered  the  witness  statements   of   [the
             appellant] and [the sponsor] carefully. Neither refers  to  the
             previous determination. Neither were able to answer  Mr  Main's
             question as to what had changed since that determination, other
             than to say that they thought it was wrong and that because  of
             their ages they could not re-establish themselves  in  Nigeria.
             [The appellant] has given no reason for  not  following  First-
             tier Tribunal Judge Clarke's findings of fact, or of any change
             in circumstances since the decision. I adopt in their  entirety
             First-tier Tribunal Judge Clarke's findings of fact."

      (ii)  The appellant would not experience  very  significant  obstacles
        to his reintegration in Nigeria, stating at paras 28 and 29:

      "28.  Applying the facts to the legal provisions, First-tier Tribunal
             Judge  Clarke  found  that  there  were   no   'insurmountable
             obstacles' to [the appellant]  and  [the  sponsor]  continuing
             their family life outside of  the  United  Kingdom;  nor  very
             significant obstacles' to [the applicant's]  integration  into
             Nigerian society. I give due weight  to  the  fact  that  [the
             sponsor] is a UK national. Of itself however that cannot be  a
             determining  feature,  as  EX.I  applies   primarily   to   UK
             nationals. [The appellant] has spent the majority of his  life
             in Nigeria. [The sponsor] is familiar with life in Nigeria  by
             way of heritage, family connections and visits. There  are  no
             language or cultural bars to [the appellant] and [the sponsor]
             establishing themselves in Nigeria. Both [the  appellant]  and
             [the sponsor] have family in Nigeria who  could  support  them
             while  they   re-establish   themselves   there.   Both   have
             transferable skills to establish themselves in Nigeria.  While
             there  would  be,  as   First-tier   Tribunal   Judge   Clarke
             identified, a degree of upheaval  and  readjustment  involved,
             there  were  [pic]no  'insurmountable   obstacles'   to   [the
             appellant] and [the  sponsor]  continuing  their  family  life
             together there; nor were there 'very significant obstacles' to
             [the appellant] integrating into Nigeria.[pic]
      29.   Nothing of substance  had  changed  since  First-tier  Tribunal
             Judge Clarke's determination. [The appellant] cannot establish
             entitlement under the Immigration Rules."


      (iii) Judge Rayner then considered the  appellant's  Article  8  claim
        outside the Immigration Rules and concluded that the  decision  was
        proportionate, saying, in relation to proportionality as follows at
        paras 33-38:

        "33.     In applying the provisions of section  117B  of  the  2002
             Act, I note that the maintenance of immigration control is  in
             the public interest. It must weigh heavily in the balance that
             [the appellant] cannot satisfy the Immigration Rules. Although
             he does not have the requisite certificate, I accept that [the
             appellant] is fully proficient in English, which is a  neutral
             feature.  [The   appellant]   is   not   himself   financially
             independent as he does not work. However, he is not reliant on
             public funds, as his  wife  supports  him.  [The  applicant's]
             relationship with [the sponsor] is genuine and subsisting, and
             was established at a time when he was here  lawfully,  insofar
             as he had  limited  leave  to  remain  when  the  relationship
             started and developed and when he and [the sponsor] married. I
             am therefore not limited as to the  weight  I  can  give  that
             relationship. As for [the appellant's] private life, the  only
             evidence I have of it is his relationship with [the  sponsor].
             In any event, such private life  as  he  has  established  was
             while his immigration status was 'precarious': although he was
             here lawfully, he had only limited leave  to  remain  and  not
             with  leave  on  a  settlement  route,  so  could   not   have
             anticipated being given further leave.  Nevertheless,  because
             he was here lawfully, I do give weight to the private life  he
             has established.


        34.      Ms Delbourgo submitted that there  had  been  a  delay  in
             immigration control that would reduce the public  interest  in
             the removal of [the appellant]. She relied on EB Kosovo v SSHD
             [20081 UKHL 41. That case was  explained  in  Agyarko  in  the
             following terms:


                 52. It is also necessary to bear in mind that the  cogency
                 of the public interest in the removal of a person living in
                 the UK unlawfully is liable to diminish  or, looking at the
                 matter from the opposite  perspective,  the  weight  to  be
                 given to precarious family life is liable to increase -  if
                 there  is  a  protracted  delay  in  the   enforcement   of
                 immigration control. This point was made  by  Lord  Bingham
                 and Lord Brown of  Eaton-under-Heywood  in  EB  (Kosovo)  v
                 Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL  41;
                 [2009] AC  1159, paras 15 and 37. It is also illustrated by
                 the judgment of the European court in Jeunesse.


        35.      I do not find that any legitimate criticism can be made of
             the  respondent  in  this  respect.  [The  applicant's]  leave
             expired on 21  January  2016.  Since  then  he  has  made  two
             applications for leave to remain, which have been  dealt  with
             expeditiously. There has been  no  'protracted  delay  in  the
             enforcement of immigration control'.


        36.      The effect of refusing [the applicant's] appeal is that he
             is likely to leave or be removed from the United Kingdom.  For
             the reasons given above, that would  not  be  disproportionate
             because there are no 'insurmountable  obstacles'  to  him  and
             [the  sponsor]  continuing  their  family  life  in   Nigeria.
             Alternatively, [the appellant] may elect to leave  the  United
             Kingdom and apply for entry clearance from Nigeria. I asked Ms
             Delbourgo  whether  it  would  be  'proportionate'  for   [the
             appellant] to return to Nigeria to make an entry  application.
             That is based on the following passage from Agyarko:


                 51. Whether the applicant is in the UK unlawfully,  or  is
                 entitled to remain in the LIK  only  temporarily,  however,
                 the significance of this consideration depends on what  the
                 outcome of immigration  control  might  otherwise  be.  For
                 example, if an applicant would otherwise  be  automatically
                 deported as a foreign criminal,  then  the  weight  of  the
                 public interest in his or her  removal  will  generally  be
                 very considerable. If, on the other hand,  an  applicant  -
                 even if residing in  the  UK  unlawfully  -  was  otherwise
                 certain to be granted  leave  to  enter,  at  least  if  an
                 application were made from outside the UK, then there might
                 be no public interest in his or her removal. The  point  is
                 illustrated by the decision in  Chikwamba  v  Secretary  of
                 State for the Home Department.


        37.      First-tier Tribunal Judge Clarke had dealt in detail  with
             a 'freestanding' Article  8  claim,  including  the  Chikwamba
             issue. Having cited the authorities, the Judge  concluded,  "I
             do not find it disproportionate for the Appellant to return to
             Nigeria and make an  entry  clearance  application.  There  is
             nothing in the Appellant's circumstances that  would  tip  the
             balance in favour of the Appellant  and  outweigh  the  strong
             public interest in maintaining effective immigration  control.
             I place reliance on my findings that the Appellant cannot meet
             the requirements of the Immigration Rules. I find the decision
             to remove is justified, lawful  and  proportionate"  paragraph
             68.


        38.       I  can  only  agree  with  that  assessment.  Indeed,  Ms
             Delbourgo gives no reason for departing from it.  This  appeal
             was in essence a rerun of [the applicant's]  2016  application
             and consequent 2018 appeal. The facts are the same, the law is
             unchanged, First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Clarke's  decision  was
             found to be unchallengeable. I dismiss he appeal for the  same
             reasons as identified by the previous Tribunal Judge."


The grounds

31. Para 2 of the grounds of appeal summarise  the  grounds  of  appeal  as
    follows:

      (i)   Ground 1:  Judge Rayner misapplied the guidance in Devaseelan  *
        [2002] UKIAT 00701.

      (ii)  Ground 2: Judge Rayner  failed  to  take  account  of  the  best
        interests of a child contrary to s.55 of the  Borders,  Citizenship
        and Immigration Act 2009 and Home Office guidelines issued pursuant
        to s.55.

      (iii) Ground 3: Judge Rayner failed to give "due regard" to s.117B  of
        the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the  "2002  Act")
        by "not taking due account of economic  considerations".  The  said
        "economic considerations" are explained at paras 21, 22 and  27  of
        the grounds which I quote at para 61 below.

      (iv)  Ground 4: Para 2(iv) explains ground 4 as follows: Judge  Rayner
        erred in equating the instant appeal "in which  some  reliance  was
        placed on EX.1. of Appendix FM in order to comply with paragraph E-
        LTRP.2.2(b) (the immigration status requirements)"  with  "a  free-
        standing Article 8 claim".

      (v)   Ground 5: In the circumstances, the  proportionality  assessment
        called for by Article 8(2) of the ECHR was not properly conducted.

32. At para 2 of the sponsor's July 2020 statement, she refers to the  fact
    that the respondent did not mention the decision of Judge Clarke in the
    decision letter dated 14  June  2019  and   that  the  respondent  only
    mentioned the decision of Judge Clarke  at  the  hearing  before  Judge
    Rayner. She therefore submits that there was a  significant  procedural
    error on the part  of  the  respondent  and  that  paras  9-14  of  the
    respondent's (.e. Mr Lindsay's) submissions dated 13 July  2020  cannot
    be sustained.

Submissions

33. I shall deal with the parties' submissions in my assessment  below,  to
    the extent that I consider it necessary to do so.



Assessment

34. The sponsor's July 2020 witness statement advances legal submissions as
    well as making statements of fact. This is inappropriate, in my view.

35. At paras 4, 5 and 6 of her July 2020 statement, the sponsor says

          "4.    Family life between  myself  and  my  grandchildren,  this
             issue came before the First Tier Tribunal (FTT) about which the
             Judge interrogated me, and I told the Judge  that  my  children
             and my grandchildren do visit us (my husband and l)  regularly.
             I am still  [pic]supporting  my  youngest  daughter  (Precious)
             financial  including  paying  for   her   [pic]medications   as
             evidenced in the bank statement and Whatsapp printout  enclosed
             [pic]herewith   Therefore,   the    Respondent's    (Lindsay's)
             submission at paragraph 17 that "There does not  appear  to  be
             any suggestion that the submissions  now  advanced  under  this
             ground were made before the FTT" is completely incorrect.


          5. As recent as May 2020, when my  youngest  daughter  (Precious)
             was ill, she was with us and I looked after her  and  paid  for
             her medications and evidence of this is found [pic]in  my  bank
             statement.  Therefore,   I   submit   that   the   Respondent's
             submissions as [pic]advanced in paragraphs 18 to 20 are totally
             incorrect.  To  the  contrary,  family  life   [pic][pic]exists
             between us meaning my husband and l,  and  between  us  and  my
             children and [pic]grandchildren. We are one big family, and  we
             enjoy family life together.


          6.     ... My six siblings are all here in the UK. I do not  have
             anyone in Nigeria. My parents are dead....[pic]"


36. Attached to the sponsor's  July  2020  statement  is  a  Barclays  bank
    statement for an account in the name of Mercy  Venture  Limited.  Three
    items, which have been marked with an asterisk, show payments of  �100,
    �39.98 and �50 respectively and which it appears  are  relied  upon  as
    evidence that the sponsor has paid for medication for Miss Precious.

37. The grounds of appeal also refer to the sponsor's grandchildren.

38. Para 3 of Ms Delbourgo's submissions dated 2 July 2020  refers  to  the
    sponsor's "developing relationship with her  young  grandchildren  (and
    consequent rapprochement with her adult  children)"  as  a  new  factor
    justifying departing from the findings of Judge Clarke.

39. I have carefully considered all the material  before  me  in  order  to
    ascertain what evidence Judge Rayner had of the sponsor's contact  with
    Miss Precious, her other children and her grandchildren.

40. There are on file two bundles of documents submitted on the appellant's
    behalf as follows: (a) a bundle containing 15 documents submitted  with
    the Notice of appeal under cover of  an  undated  letter  by  A.Vincent
    Solicitors which was signed on 25 June 2019 (hereafter the "appellant's
    bundle A" or "ABA"); and (b) a 237-page bundle of documents  (hereafter
    the "appellant's bundle B" or "ABB").

41. Having considered all of the material on file, including Judge Rayner's
    record of the  proceedings  (hereafter  the  "RoP"),  I  am  absolutely
    satisfied as follows:

      (i)   The only evidence that  Judge  Rayner  had  before  him  of  the
        sponsor's contact with Miss Precious  was  the  evidence  that  was
        before Judge Clarke. That evidence had  been  considered  by  Judge
        Clarke.

      (ii)  In particular, it is to  be  noted  that  the  sponsor  did  not
        mention Miss Precious in terms in her witness  statement  dated  22
        August 2019 other than to refer to her in general terms at para  17
        (ABB/111-114) as follows:

                 "my four children who also  were  born  here  and  are  all
                 British citizens and are settled in the UK".

      (iii) Furthermore, it  should  be  noted  that  the  sponsor  did  not
        mention Miss Precious at all in her oral evidence.

      (iv)  Apart from that what she said about her children at para  17  of
        her witness statement  dated  22  August  2019  (ABB/111-114),  the
        sponsor did not mention her other  three  children  in  the  appeal
        before Judge Rayner. Accordingly,  the  only  evidence  that  Judge
        Rayner had about the sponsor's contact with her other children  was
        the evidence  that  was  before  Judge  Clarke.  Judge  Clarke  had
        considered that evidence.

      (v)   In relation to the grandchildren, the only evidence  that  Judge
        Rayner had before him of the sponsor's grandchildren was  given  by
        the sponsor in re-examination. In re-examination, she was asked  if
        she had any grandchildren and she said:  "2  boys".  She  was  then
        asked how old they were and she said: "2 and 4".

      (vi)  It is to be noted that the sponsor  did  not  even  mention  her
        grandchildren at para 17 of her witness statement dated  22  August
        2019. This is a striking omission.

      (vii) It is also to be  noted  that  the  sponsor's  evidence  in  re-
        examination  amounts  to  evidence  of   the   existence   of   two
        grandchildren but she did not give any evidence at all that she had
        any contact with them.

      (viii)     There was no evidence at all before Judge Rayner  that  the
        sponsor's siblings are in the United Kingdom and/or that  she  does
        not have any family in Nigeria. The only evidence that Judge Rayner
        had before him in this regard was  the  evidence  that  was  before
        Judge Clarke. That evidence had been considered by Judge Clarke.

42. I am therefore absolutely satisfied that paras 4 and 5 of the sponsor's
    July 2020 statement, to the extent that it  refers  to  anything  other
    than  the  mere  existence  of  two  grandchildren,  constitutes  fresh
    evidence which was not before Judge Rayner and which  therefore  cannot
    be relied upon in order to establish that he erred in law.

43.  Judge  Rayner  referred  to  the  sponsor's  oral  evidence   of   her
    grandchildren at para 22 of his decision, quoted at my para 28 above. I
    am satisfied that what he said at para 22  of  his  decision  correctly
    represented the sum total of the evidence that was before him about the
    sponsor's grandchildren. I  am  satisfied  that  he  did  not  overlook
    relevant evidence.

44. Likewise, I am satisfied that the sponsor's assertions at para 6 of her
    July 2020 statement that her siblings are all in the United Kingdom and
    that she does not have family in Nigeria constitute fresh evidence that
    was not before Judge Rayner and therefore  cannot  be  relied  upon  in
    order to establish an error of law. Likewise the evidence  attached  to
    the sponsor's July 2020 statement, including the bank statement  relied
    upon to show that the sponsor has paid for medication for Miss Precious
    on three occasions, the evidence  of  the  Whatsapp  messages  and  the
    photographs.

45. The final paragraph of para 6(ii)  of  the  grounds  contends,  in  the
    context of ground 1, that the existence of grandchildren constitutes  a
    material change from the evidence that was before Judge Clarke. This is
    a wholly untenable submission. Given that there was no evidence at  all
    before  Judge  Rayner  that  the  sponsor  had  any  contact  with  her
    grandchildren, the submission that the mere existence of  grandchildren
    constituted a material change is wholly untenable.

46. The significance of the fact that there was no  evidence  before  Judge
    Rayner of any contact between the sponsor and her grandchildren becomes
    clear  when  one  considers  Judge  Clarke's  findings  concerning  the
    sponsor's contact with her children, i.e. that she had not seen her son
    Neil since the latter part of 2014, that she had not seen her son  Glen
    since 2016 and that her contact with her daughter, Miss  Precious,  was
    mostly by telephone. In these circumstances, there was simply no  basis
    for  any  inferences  to  be  drawn,  by  the  mere  existence  of  two
    grandchildren, that the sponsor had any  meaningful  contact  with  her
    grandchildren and/or that their best interests would in any be affected
    adversely if she decided to relocate to Nigeria to  enjoy  family  life
    with the appellant there.

47. Accordingly, there is no foundation at all for the submission at para 3
    of Ms Delbourgo's submissions dated 2 July 2020 where she refers to the
    sponsor's "developing relationship with her  young  grandchildren  (and
    consequent rapprochement with her adult  children)"  as  a  new  factor
    justifying departing from the findings of Judge Clarke.

48. Indeed, I cannot see how Ms Delbourgo, who appeared before Judge Rayner
    and who  also  drafted  the  grounds  of  appeal  and  the  appellant's
    submissions dated 2 July 2020, could  properly  have  referred  to  the
    sponsor's "developing relationship with her  young  grandchildren"  and
    her "(consequent rapprochement with her adult children)".

49. I turn now to deal with the grounds.

50. Ground 1 contends that Judge Rayner erred in following the guidance  in
    Devaseelan. It is said that Judge Clarke's  findings  should  have  had
    little bearing on the outcome of  the  appeal  that  was  before  Judge
    Rayner for various reasons which I will now summarise, as follows:

      (i)   It is said (para 6(i) of the grounds) that  the  hearing  before
        Judge Clarke took place over a year earlier; that the appellant had
        given evidence in the appeal before Judge Rayner that  he  did  not
        now have available the financial resources which would  enable  him
        to set himself up in Nigeria whereas his evidence in  the  previous
        appeal according to para 44 of Judge Clarke's decision was that  he
        had savings from the sale of a property in Nigeria.

      (ii)  The sponsor was over a year older than she was at  the  time  of
        the hearing before Judge Clarke. The sponsor and the appellant gave
        evidence that at the sponsor's age she would struggle to find a job
        in Nigeria.

      (iii) There was no mention in the appeal before Judge  Clarke  of  the
        sponsor's grandchildren whereas the sponsor had given oral evidence
        before Judge Rayner that she had two grandchildren who were aged  2
        years and 4 years.

      (iv)  The appellant had  submitted  documents  in  the  appeal  before
        Judge Rayner that the sponsor worked for the NHS as  a  nurse  with
        earning substantially in excess of the minimum income threshold.

      (v)   Time had passed since the decision  of  Judge  Clarke.  In  this
        regard, it is to be noted that a period of 1 year 4 months  elapsed
        between the hearing date before Judge Clarke (8 June 2018) and  the
        hearing date before Judge Rayner (21 October 2019).

51. However, point (i) ignores the fact that Judge Rayner found (at para 28
    of his decision) that both the appellant and the sponsor have family in
    Nigeria who could support them and that there was  no  evidence  before
    Judge Rayner to the contrary (see  my  para  41(viii)  above).  I  have
    already  dealt  with  point  (iii)  which  relates  to  the   sponsor's
    grandchildren. Point (iv) ignores the fact that the respondent accepted
    in the refusal letter that the  sponsor's  income  was  more  than  the
    minimum income threshold, as Judge Rayner said at para  18(iv)  of  his
    decision.

52. Judge Rayner was aware of the passage of time but, as he said at   para
    29 of his decision,  nothing  of  substance  had  changed  since  Judge
    Clarke's decision. Indeed, I am satisfied that, on the evidence  before
    Judge Rayner, the appellant's claim before Judge Rayner was weaker, not
    stronger, than his claim before  Judge  Clarke  because  there  was  no
    attempt in the appeal before Judge Rayner to rely  upon  the  sponsor's
    relationship with any of her children and the grandchildren  were  only
    mentioned in her oral evidence in bare terms.  It  is  therefore  self-
    evident that points (ii) and (v) amount to no more than a  disagreement
    with the decision of Judge Rayner.

53. For the reasons given above, there is no substance in  the  appellant's
    submissions dated 2 July 2020 in relation to ground 1.

54. I turn to the attempt at para 2 of the sponsor's July 2020 statement to
    rely upon an alleged procedural error on the part of the respondent  in
    order to suggest  that  Mr  Lindsay's  submissions  at  para  9-14  (in
    relation to ground 1) cannot be sustained.

55.  However,  the  fact  is  that  the  respondent  is  entitled  to  make
    submissions on the grounds on which permission was  granted.  If  there
    was any procedural error, that does  not,  of  itself,  disentitle  the
    respondent from making submissions in response to the grounds on  which
    permission was granted. Further, and in any event,  the  appellant  was
    represented by Counsel at the hearing before Judge Rayner. No objection
    was raised to the respondent's production  of  the  decision  of  Judge
    Clarke. Indeed, it is difficult to see how  any  such  objection  could
    properly have led to the decision of Judge Clarke being excluded, given
    that the appellant and the sponsor confirmed in evidence that they were
    aware of the previous decision and that, if they had required  time  to
    consider the decision of Judge Clarke  before  the  hearing  commenced,
    their Counsel would no doubt have requested Judge Rayner to allow  them
    some time.

56. Para 7 of the grounds then contends that  "the  legal  context  of  the
    appeal  presently  being  considered  was  so  different,  for  reasons
    explored in more detail below" that Judge Clarke's ruling  should  have
    had little bearing on the outcome of the present appeal.

57. What then follows is ground 2 which  relies  upon  s.55  and  the  best
    interests of a child. Paras 12-15 of the grounds then state:

        "12.     It is submitted that the advent of grandchildren is likely
             to have  altered  the  relationship  of  the  [pic]Appellant's
             spouse with her adult children. A grandmother, especially  one
             with medical knowledge, may be a welcome resource for  parents
             with young children - whilst grandparents may welcome  contact
             with the young children.


        13.      In this particular case the very night shifts, which Judge
             Clarke noted (at paragraph 26 of his judgment) as causing  the
             Appellant's wife to forgo custody of her younger children,  it
             is submitted should mean that she would  be  available  during
             the day to take care of her grandchildren whilst their parents
             might be at work.


        14.      The  grandchildren  themselves,  it  is  submitted,  would
             benefit from support from their extended family.


        15.      It is submitted that were the  Appellant's  spouse  to  be
             obliged to return to Nigeria she would not be able to  provide
             such support so she would have to choose between  her  husband
             and her grandchildren."


58. I was surprised to read these submissions, as it  is  plain  that  they
    could not properly have been made, especially in view of the fact  that
    the author of the grounds was Ms Delbourgo who  appeared  before  Judge
    Rayner and who therefore ought to have been aware that paras  12-15  of
    the grounds amounted to pure speculation and supposition as  there  was
    no such evidence before Judge Rayner.

59. There is therefore no substance at all in the submissions at  paras  16
    and 17 of the grounds in relation to ground 2, that Judge Rayner  erred
    in  failing  to  consider  the  best   interests   of   the   sponsor's
    grandchildren in his consideration of whether the  appellant  satisfied
    the requirements of para 276ADE(1) or whether there were insurmountable
    obstacles  to  family  life  between  the  appellant  and  the  sponsor
    continuing outside the United Kingdom or whether there were exceptional
    circumstances.

60. For the reasons given above, I reject paras  9-12  of  the  appellant's
    submissions dated 2 July 2020 in relation to  ground  2.  There  is  no
    foundation at all to ground 2.

61. Ground 3 contends that Judge Rayner failed  to  give  "due  regard"  to
    s.117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  (the  "2002
    Act") by "not taking due account of economic considerations". Paras 18-
    27 of the grounds  begin  by  referring  to  Judge  Clarke's  decision,
    including paras 27 and 33 thereof, to the effect that the  sponsor  has
    been providing  financial  support  to  three  households  out  of  her
    earnings as a nurse whereas she gave evidence to Judge Rayner that  she
    would not now be able to find a job in Nigeria due to her age  and  the
    appellant gave evidence that he did not now have financial resources to
    set himself up in Nigeria. Paras 21, 22 and  27  of  the  grounds  then
    state:

        "21.     It is submitted that although the Appellant and  his  wife
             might have been welcomed in Nigeria as benefactors  that  would
             not  necessarily  be  the  case  if  they   now   returned   as
             supplicants.[pic]


        22.      The Appellant's spouse may feel constrained to  remain  in
             the UK for financial reasons at some [pic]cost to her emotional
             well-being just as Judge Clarke noted at paragraph  26  of  his
             judgment that the demands of her job meant she  had  previously
             to forgo custody of her younger children.


        27.      Moreover, as the Appellant's  spouse  has  been  providing
             financial support in the UK to [pic]her  ex-husband  and  adult
             child, were she to accompany the Appellant if he was obliged to
             return to Nigeria, then, it would increase the possibility that
             those others she had  been  [pic]supporting  in  the  UK  would
             become a burden on the state.[pic]"


62. Para 14 of the appellant's submissions dated 2 July 2020 also refer  to
    the sponsor providing support for several  households.  However,  there
    was no evidence before Judge Rayner that, as at the date of the hearing
    before him, the sponsor continued to provide financial support  to  her
    adult children.

63. It is self-evident that paras 21 and 22 of the  grounds  are  based  on
    supposition and speculation and/or amount to an attempt to re-argue the
    decision of Judge Rayner.

64. There is no foundation at all  for  the  assertion  that  Judge  Rayner
    failed to take into account "economic considerations" because the  said
    "economic  considerations"  are   in   fact   mere   suppositions   and
    speculation, which is surprising  given  that  Ms  Delbourgo   appeared
    before Judge Rayner and was the author of the grounds.

65. Para 26 of the grounds contends that Judge Rayner failed to  note  that
    Judge Clarke  had  interpreted  s.117B  as  to  financial  independence
    incorrectly,  in  that,  he  penalised  the  appellant  for  not  being
    financially independent but was instead dependent upon his  wife.  Para
    26 of the grounds draws attention to the fact that the Supreme  Court's
    decision in Rhuppiah v SSHD [2018] UKSC 58 was  a  change  in  the  law
    since the decision of Judge Clarke.

66. However, this submission simply ignores the fact that Judge Rayner  did
    not make that error. He specifically said, at para 33 of his  decision,
    that the appellant is not reliant on public funds as his wife  supports
    him.

67. I therefore reject ground 3.

68. I turn to ground 4.

69. The reader  would  be  forgiven  for  not  understanding  ground  4  as
    described at para 2(iv) of the grounds -  see  my  para  31(iv)  above.
    Paras  29-38  of  the  grounds  explain  ground  4  under  the  heading
    "Different legal context". In effect, it is contended as follows:

      (i)   The appeal before Judge Clarke was  a  free-standing  Article  8
        appeal. This was because  the  application  to  which  that  appeal
        related was an application for leave to  remain  as  a  parent  but
        Judge Clarke found that the appellant was not a parent of  a  child
        under the age of 18 and therefore he could not  succeed  under  the
        parent route.

      (ii)  The appeal before Judge Rayner was an appeal that related to  an
        application for leave to  remain  as  spouse.  The  respondent  had
        accepted that the appellant satisfied the suitability  requirements
        as well as the requirements as to  eligible  relationship  and  the
        financial eligibility requirement. Whilst the  respondent  did  not
        accept that the appellant met  the  English  language  requirement,
        Judge Rayner accepted at para 33 that the appellant was  proficient
        in English. Accordingly,  "the  only  infraction"  in  the  instant
        appeal was the immigration status requirement. In this regard,  the
        appellant's  immigration  history  shows  that   his   periods   of
        overstaying were "relatively minor".

      (iii) Thus, whilst Judge Clarke was faced with "a  glaring  breach  of
        the immigration rules", Judge Rayner was faced  with  "a  different
        type of application where the infraction was much more minor".

      (iv)  Para 38 of the grounds then states:

                 "Insofar as the  previous  determination  was  relevant  at
                 all, it is submitted that Judge Rayner wrongly applied  the
                 same weight to the Appellant's breach  of  the  Immigration
                 Rules  as  Judge  Clarke  had  done   in   very   different
                 circumstances."

      (v)   Para 17  of  the  appellant's  submissions  dated  2  July  2020
        contends that  fairness  required  Judge  Rayner  to  consider  the
        appellant's Article 8 claim afresh.

70. It was argued before Judge Rayner that the appeal before  Judge  Clarke
    was in a different legal context because the appeal before Judge Clarke
    concerned an application for leave to remain as a  parent  whereas  the
    appeal before Judge Rayner concerned an application for leave to remain
    as spouse. Judge Rayner rejected Ms Delbourgo's  submission  that  this
    was relevant and that he should therefore depart from the  findings  of
    Judge Clarke. The grounds contend that Judge Clarke's decision was  not
    relevant at all or, in the alternative, that the said "different  legal
    context" meant that Judge Rayner was led into the error of placing  too
    much on Judge Clarke's findings or too much weight on  the  appellant's
    "relatively minor infraction" of the immigration status requirement.

71. Judge Rayner was entirely correct to reject Ms Delbourgo's submissions.
    The fact is that the factual  issues  before  Judge  Clarke  and  Judge
    Rayner  were  the  same,  namely,  whether  there  were  insurmountable
    obstacles  to  family  life  between  the  appellant  and  the  sponsor
    continuing in Nigeria; whether there were very significant obstacles to
    the appellant's reintegration in Nigeria and, if the answer to both  of
    these  questions  was  "no",  then  whether  there   were   exceptional
    circumstances which meant that refusal would be a breach of Article  8.
    Judge Rayner was therefore correct to say that Judge Clarke's findings,
    which were made only 1 year 4 months earlier, were a starting point.

72. Furthermore, it is unreasonable and perhaps even misleading to  suggest
    that that there was a "relatively minor infraction" of the  immigration
    status requirement in the appeal before Judge Rayner.  The  appellant's
    leave expired on 21 January 2016, as Judge  Rayner  correctly  said  at
    para 18(iii) of his decision. He made  the  application  that  was  the
    subject of the appeal before Judge Clarke on 5 February 2016, i.e.  out
    of time. Thus, as at the date of the hearing before Judge Rayner on  21
    October 2019, he had been in the United Kingdom unlawfully for a period
    of 3 years 9 months.

73. It may be that, in referring to the "relatively  minor  infraction"  of
    the immigration status requirement, Ms Delbourgo was referring  to  the
    fact that the appellant's application of 5 February 2016 was made  only
    15 days after his leave had expired on 21 January 2016. If that is  so,
    it makes no difference to the period of his overstay as at the date  of
    Judge Rayner's decision that he made his application only 15 days after
    his leave expired. It was his choice to make his  application  when  he
    did. It does  not  make  his  "infraction  of  the  immigration  status
    requirement" a minor one, on any reasonable view. This part  of  ground
    4, and the related submissions of Ms Delbourgo in her submissions dated
    2 July 2020, amount to no more than a disagreement with the weight that
    Judge Rayner placed on  the  appellant's  period  of  overstay  in  the
    balancing exercise in relation to proportionality.

74. In his assessment of proportionality at  para  33,  Judge  Rayner  said
    that, although  the  appellant  did  not  have  the  requisite  English
    language certificate, he was proficient in English which  he  correctly
    noted was a neutral factor.

75. There is therefore no substance in ground 4. I therefore reject  ground
    4.

76. Ground 5 contends that,  "in  the  circumstances,  the  proportionality
    assessment called for by Article 8(2) of  the  ECHR  was  not  properly
    conducted". This is  elaborated  at  paras  19-25  of  the  appellant's
    submissions dated 2 July 2020 which read:

        "19.     For the reasons given above and in the Grounds of  Appeal,
             it is submitted that Judge Rayner failed to properly apply the
             statutory guidance in ss. 117A and  117B  of  the  Nationality
             Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.[pic]


        20.      By relying on the previous decision of Judge  Clarke  when
             considering the breach of the Immigration Rules  Judge  Rayner
             gave heavy weight to a breach, which it has been submitted was
             relatively minor, as Judge Clarke had done in the  context  of
             an  appeal  which  was  wholly  outside  the  terms   of   the
             Immigration Rules.


        21.      Judge Rayner accepted at paragraph 33 of his judgment that
             the Appellant had a good standard of English.


        22.       Meanwhile,  there  were  strong  economic  factors   also
             weighing in the Appellant's favour.


        23.      Judge Rayner accepted  that  the  negative  provisions  of
             s.117B(4)  did  not  apply  and  despite  the  provisions   of
             s.117B(5) afforded the Appellant some  credit  for  a  private
             life established whilst he was lawfully in the UK.


        24.      Whilst s.117B(6) might not strictly be applicable,  it  is
             submitted that by analogy with that provision the interests of
             the sponsor's grandchildren should favour the Appellant as the
             sponsor being allowed to remain in the UK.


        25.      Accordingly, it is clear that the balance should have come
             down in the Appellant's favour and it is submitted that  Judge
             Rayner was wrong to hold otherwise."


77. Section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act applies if a "person has a genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with  a  qualifying  child".  However,
    para 24 ignores the fact that there was no evidence at all b,

78. However, para 24 of  Ms  Delbourgo's  submissions  dated  2  July  2020
    ignores the fact that there was no evidence at all before Judge  Rayner
    that the sponsor had any contact at all  with  her  grandchildren,  let
    alone a parental relationship with them.

79. The remainder of paras 19-25 of Ms Delbourgo's submissions dated 2 July
    2020 fail to identify any factors that Judge Rayner failed to take into
    account. In reality, paras 19-25 of these submissions amount to no more
    than a disagreement with Judge Rayner's assessment of proportionality.

80. For all of the reasons given above, Judge Rayner did not err in law.  I
    therefore dismiss the appellant's appeal.

81. This is a case in which permission should not have been granted. It may
    be that Judge Foudy, who mentioned specifically that Judge  Rayner  may
    have failed to properly consider the best  interests  of  children  and
    that  it  was  arguable  that  he  had  not  taken   into   "sufficient
    consideration the best interests of the grandchildren  in  the  family"
    mistakenly thought that there was evidence before Judge Rayner  of  the
    relationship between the sponsor and her grandchildren  whereas,  as  I
    have said above, there was no evidence that she had  any  contact  with
    them.

82. Judge Rayner said, at para 38 of his decision, that the  appeal  before
    him was a re-run of the appellant's 2018 appeal. It may  be  said  that
    this was a generous description because  the  evidence  in  the  appeal
    before Judge Rayner was weaker, as  reliance  was  not  placed  in  the
    appeal before Judge Rayner on the sponsor's relationship  with  any  of
    her children and  she  only  barely  mentioned  the  existence  of  two
    grandchildren, giving no evidence at all that she had any contact  with
    them.  It is therefore difficult to see how the respondent reached  the
    conclusion that the appellant's application of  24  April  2019  was  a
    "fresh claim" within the meaning of para 353 of the Immigration Rules.


Notice of Decision

83. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    any error on a point of law such that it fell  to  be  set  aside.  The
    appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is therefore dismissed.
