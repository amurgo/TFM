Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Katani & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The respondent refused the appellant's asylum, human rights  and  other
    claims for reasons explained in her decision dated 15 August 2017.

 2. FtT Judge Doyle dismissed the appellant's appeal for reasons  explained
    in his decision promulgated on 6 October 2017.

 3. At �27 the judge said, "S.117B of the 2002 Act  tells  me  that  I  can
    place little weight on a relationship formed while the appellant was in
    the UK unlawfully".

 4. The appeal to the UT is on the ground that the judge erred  by  failing
    to recognise that the  statutory  provision  can  be  overridden  by  a
    sufficiently strong case, on the authority of Rhuppiah  v  SSHD  [2016]
    EWCA Civ 803, [2016] 1 WLR 4203.  This is said to be material for  four
    reasons which, lightly edited, are as follows:

      (i) The FtT failed to make any credibility findings on the evidence of
      the appellant's partner (Mr Craig) at �32.  If  credible,  that  would
      undermine the finding that there was adequate care available from  the
      local authority or other family members.  Although it is in the public
      domain that NHS care is available, it is not within judicial knowledge
      or within the public domain what specific care is available for  those
      with advanced dementia and where the evidence was that  Mr  Craig  was
      his wife's carer.  There was no  finding  that  Mr  Craig's  daughters
      would be able to assist.  To suggest that they would was not supported
      by the evidence.

      (ii) There was no, or insufficient, evidence that [Mrs Craig] would be
      able to receive adequate care from the local authority.

      (iii) The FtT erred at �28 by relying on [the facts of]  a  case  when
      each case is fact specific.  Although the FtT refers  to  Agyarko  the
      FtT at �32-33 failed to assess  relevant  factors.  In  expecting  the
      appellant's partner to relocate the  relevant  factors  were:  he  had
      lived all his life in the UK; all his family were in the UK; he had no
      ties in Malaysia; he had accommodation; he would face language issues.

      (iv) The FtT erred when finding [the appellant] should return to apply
      for entry clearance, failing to  ask  whether  there  was  a  sensible
      reason [to expect her to do so]: MA (Pakistan) v SSHD  [2010]  Imm  AR
      196.  There was no sensible reason where it was not disputed that  the
      relationship was genuine and subsisting.
 5. Both parties based their submissions on �53 of Rhuppiah:
      Reading  section  117A(2)(a)  in  conjunction  with  section   117B(5)
      produces this: "In considering the public interest question, the court
      or tribunal must have regard to the consideration that  little  weight
      should be given to a private life established by a person  at  a  time
      when the  person's  immigration  status  is  precarious".  That  is  a
      normative statement which is less definitive than those given  by  the
      other sub-sections in section 117B and section 117C. Although a  court
      or tribunal should have regard to the consideration that little weight
      should be given to private life established in such circumstances,  it
      is possible  without  violence  to  the  language  to  say  that  such
      generalised normative guidance may be  overridden  in  an  exceptional
      case by particularly strong features of the private life in  question,
      where it is not appropriate in Article 8 terms to attach  only  little
      weight to private life. That is to say,  for  a  case  falling  within
      section  117B(5)  little  weight  should  be  given  to  private  life
      established in the circumstances specified, but that approach  may  be
      overridden where the private  life  in  question  has  a  special  and
      compelling character. Such an  interpretation  is  also  necessary  to
      prevent section 117B(5) being applied in a manner which would  produce
      results in some cases which would be incompatible with Article 8, i.e.
      is necessary to give proper effect to Parliament's intention  in  Part
      5A; and a similar interpretation of section 117B(4) is  required,  for
      same reasons. (Mr  Byass'  own  suggestion,  that  the  words  "Little
      weight" in sub-sections 117B(4) and (5) should be read so as  to  mean
      "great weight" should be attached to private  or  family  life  in  an
      appropriate case seemed to me to be linguistically untenable, although
      directed to the same outcome of achieving compatibility  with  Article
      8).

 6. Having considered the grounds and submissions, I am not persuaded  that
    any error of law is disclosed, such as to require the  decision  to  be
    set aside and remade.

 7. Mr Winter accepted that the FtT had not been referred to Rhuppiah.   He
    said that nevertheless this was a matter of law  which  the  judge  was
    bound to take into account, and that he "wrong footed" himself  in  the
    rest of his assessment by taking the statutory provision as absolute.

 8. Judges seldom fall into  error  of  law  by  applying  plain  words  of
    statute.

 9. No doubt the judge, if asked, would have made  a  specific  finding  on
    whether statute was overridden, but  that  was  for  the  appellant  to
    advance in the first place.  There was no point  of  law  so  obviously
    applying to the  facts  in  her  favour  that  the  judge  should  have
    identified and considered it with no invitation to do so.

10. The relationship between the appellant and Mr Craig began in July 2016,
    while she was here unlawfully, and they moved in  together  in  January
    2017 (in the same household as Mrs Craig).  The human rights aspect was
    raised in course of an asylum claim made after the appellant was served
    with notice of removal following an enforcement visit to  a  restaurant
    where she was working on 6 January 2017.  As Mr Matthews  pointed  out,
    the relationship fell well short of the terms of the immigration rules,
    not only as to the appellant's immigration status but also in terms  of
    duration and absence of any evidence that financial requirements  might
    be met.  The starting point was weak.  In the language of Rhuppiah,  to
    override the statutory norm  the  judge  would  have  had  to  find  an
    "exceptional  case",  of  "special  and  compelling  character",   with
    "particularly strong features".  It is difficult to  see  that  if  the
    judge had been invited to analyse the case in these terms  there  might
    have been a different result.

11. Dealing with the points on which it was argued that any error would  be
    material:

      (i) and (ii). This was not a  credibility  case.   The  primary  facts
      about family relationships were accepted as advanced.   It  is  within
      judicial knowledge and the public domain that the  UK  state  provides
      essential  care  to  its  citizens,  including  those  with   advanced
      dementia.  Of course, publicly and privately provided care may not  be
      of the same nature or quality, but, as Mr Winter accepted, the  burden
      was on the appellant to prove any special features which might advance
      her case.  The judge accurately pointed out at �32 that  scant  detail
      was provided.  Deficiencies in the evidence went against  her  not  in
      her favour.  (There were, for example, no  medical,  social  work,  or
      other professional reports.)

      (iii). This sub-ground is only insistence and  disagreement  with  the
      proportionality  assessment,  reciting  obvious  features   which   an
      experienced judge used to dealing with cases raising such issues could
      not have overlooked.

      (iv).  It was perhaps not helpful to leave the remark hanging that the
      appellant could apply for entry clearance, but it is true as far as it
      goes.  Whether the appellant might have  any  application  open  which
      carries much prospect of success is unknown on the evidence, but seems
      doubtful.  It is not a case where it appears she might succeed but for
      the procedural requirement to apply from abroad.  There is nothing  in
      this sub-ground which might have led to another outcome.

12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

13. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
