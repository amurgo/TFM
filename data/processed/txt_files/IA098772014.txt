For the Appellant:     Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Appellant in person


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The background to this appeal is set out in my decision of  12  January
    2015.  I found that the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Thorne contained an error on a point of law and had to be set aside.  A
    copy of my decision is annexed hereto for convenience.

 2. Because I was unable to remake  the  decision  on  6  January  2014,  a
    resumed hearing was arranged. At the  end  of  the  resumed  hearing  I
    announced that I would remake the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    to allow the original appeal against the EEA decision  of  11  February
    2014 refusing to issue a residence card. I reserved my reasons, which I
    now give.

 3. As indicated in my earlier decision, the appellant could  succeed  only
    by showing that his wife was a qualified person at some point since she
    arrived in the UK. This was necessary because, without proving she was,
    the appellant was not able to show that he derived a right of residence
    as a family member.

 4. At the resumed hearing the appellant produced cogent evidence that  his
    wife had established in business and that she was therefore a qualified
    person. The evidence showed that the appellant's wife  had  established
    an online business providing images and associated graphic design work.
    She had received income from her business. She had registered  as  self
    employed with HMRC.

 5. Mr Mills accepted that the evidence was clear and cogent.  Although  it
    had not been submitted in accordance with directions he informed me  he
    had no basis on which he could ask for it  to  be  excluded  since  its
    content  and  relevance  was  obvious.  Mr  Mills  accepted  that   the
    appellant's wife was self employed and therefore was a qualified person
    from whom the appellant derived a  right  of  residence.  Although  the
    basis for this was wholly different to  the  original  application,  Mr
    Mills conceded that the appellant was  entitled  to  a  residence  card
    confirming his right of residence.

 6. I am satisfied that  this  is  correct  in  law.  Irrespective  of  the
    appellant's immigration history, when remaking the decision I  have  to
    consider the facts as at the date of hearing. Being self employed,  the
    appellant's  wife  satisfies  regulation  4(1)(b)  of  the   2006   EEA
    Regulations. As such she is a qualified  person  for  the  purposes  of
    regulation 6. It follows from regulation 7 that  the  appellant  has  a
    right of residence and is  entitled  to  have  that  confirmed  by  the
    issuance of residence documentation as per regulation 14.



Decision

The Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is  allowed  to  the
extent that there was an error on a point of law that required the  decision
of the First-tier Tribunal to be set aside and remade.

When remaking the decision, the appeal against the EEA decision refusing  to
issue a residence card is allowed.

                               Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal
ANNEX:
Decision of 12 January 2015 on there being an error on a point  of  law  and
to set aside the First-Tier Tribunal's determination

Date of hearing   6 January 2015

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms R Manning , instructed by Sabz Solicitors,
Birmingham

 1. The Secretary of State  appeals  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  against  the
    determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Thorne that was  promulgated
    on 23 September 2014.   Judge  Thorne  allowed  Mr  Szymanski's  appeal
    against the EEA decision of  11  February  2014  refusing  to  issue  a
    residence card.

 2. Mr Szymanski was born on 14 November 1980 and is a citizen of the  USA.
    He arrived in the UK on 29 December 2012 with his  wife  and  then  two
    children.  At that time Mr Szymanski held an EEA family permit that had
    been issued to him on 9 November 2012 and which was valid until  9  May
    2013.  Since arriving in the UK, the couple have had a third child.

 3. Mr Szymanski applied for a residence card on 6  December  2013  on  the
    basis that his wife, a French national, was a qualified person for  the
    purposes of the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2006
    as a self-sufficient person.  On 11 February  2014,  the  Secretary  of
    State refused to issue  the  requested  document  because  insufficient
    evidence had been provided to show  that  Mrs  Szymanski  was  a  self-
    sufficient person.

 4. On  appeal,  Judge  Thorne  came  to  the  following  conclusions  (see
    paragraphs 22 to 25 of his determination).

     a. Mr Szymanski, his wife and their three  children  were  covered  by
        comprehensive sickness insurance.

     b. Mr Szymanski earnings of  over  ï¿½31,000  per  year  was  more  than
        sufficient to support the  family  group  and  were  sufficient  to
        ensure that family would not become a burden  on  the  UK's  social
        assistance system.

     c. Mr Szymanski derived a right of residence from his wife  who  as  a
        self sufficient person was a qualified person in the UK.

 5. The Secretary of State's appeal against this decision is on the grounds
    that it was not open to Judge Thorne to find that an EEA national is  a
    self-sufficient person on the basis of earnings from  a  third  country
    national.  The Secretary of State relied on the reported  decision,  MA
    and  others  (EU   national;   self-sufficiency;   lawful   employment)
    Bangladesh [2006] UKAIT 00090.

 6. The Secretary of  State  commented,  "It  is  submitted  that  the  EEA
    national sponsor must first exercise her treaty rights  to  enable  the
    appellant to derive his rights."  It is argued that such an approach is
    necessary to prevent a circular argument where Mr Szymanski  relies  on
    his wife being a qualified  person  in  order  to  derive  a  right  of
    residence and thereby his right to work in the UK,  the  earnings  from
    such employment being the basis on which his wife is able to  establish
    her right of residence.

 7. Mr Mills relied on these grounds.  He supplemented them by saying  that
    Mr Szymanski had not established that his wife had ever  established  a
    right of residence prior to him taking employment.  Although there  was
    some evidence that she had funds of her own, they were insufficient  to
    show she had a right of residence because  they  were  not  substantial
    savings.

 8. Ms Manning relied on her rule 24 response in which she asserted  simply
    that Judge Thorne had correctly determined that  Mrs  Szymanski  was  a
    self sufficient person under the Regulations.  She reminded me that the
    evidence before the First-tier Tribunal had been that Mrs Szymanski had
    intended to work in the UK but had been prevented from so doing because
    she was pregnant, the couple's third child being born in the UK  on  21
    September 2013.  In paragraph 4 of her skeleton  argument,  Ms  Manning
    comments that Mrs Szymanski is working although no evidence of that has
    been provided.

 9. Ms Manning also relied on Ahmed (Amos; Zambrano; reg 15A(3)(c) 2006 EEA
    Regs) [2013] UKUT 89 (IAC) on the grounds that if Mr Szymanski was  not
    allowed to remain in the UK, then the whole family would be  forced  to
    return to the USA.

10. Both  representatives  referred  to  article  8  of  the  human  rights
    convention and mounted opposing views as to how the EEA decision  would
    or would not interfere  with  the  family's  private  and  family  life
    rights.

11. At the end of the hearing I indicated that I would have to  review  the
    case law and consider whether the determination contained an error on a
    point of law.  I not consider that issue.

12. I begin by rejecting the arguments presented by Ms Manning in  relation
    to article 8 and the points raised in Ahmed.  As confirmed by Mr Mills,
    it has never been the Secretary of State's  case  that  Judge  Thorne's
    determination was defective  because  he  failed  to  deal  with  these
    issues.  It is  evident  that  there  has  been  no  cross  appeal  and
    therefore Ms Manning  cannot  introduce  these  issues  at  this  stage
    although I acknowledge they may be relevant to remaking the decision if
    I were to find there had been an error on a point of law.

13. I move on to  consider  the  substance  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
    grounds.  Although I was  not  referred  to  either  of  the  following
    reported decisions, I have had regard to  both:  Seye  (Chen  children;
    employment) [2013] UKUT 178 (IAC) and Boodoo  and  another  (EEA  Regs;
    relevant evidence) [2013]  UKUT  346  (IAC).   The  first  reviews  the
    Tribunal's view of whether the income of a third country  national  can
    establish that an EEA national is a self-sufficient person,  and  after
    examining its earlier case law together  with  jurisprudence  from  the
    Court of Appeal and Court of Justice of the  European  Union  concludes
    that the negative propositions in MA and others and related cases  must
    be regarded as doubtful.  The second case serves as a reminder that  in
    an appeal against an EEA decision, post-decision evidence can be  taken
    into account if it is material to the decision, the relevant date being
    the date of hearing.

14. Although the decision in  Seye  undermines  the  Secretary  of  State's
    ground of appeal relying on MA and  others  it  does  not  disturb  the
    principle argument, "It is submitted that the EEA national sponsor must
    first exercise her treaty rights to enable the appellant to derive  his
    rights."

15. The fact Judge Thorne failed to engage with this question,  and  at  no
    point identifies when or on what basis Mrs  Szymanski  established  her
    right of residence in the UK other than by reference to Mr  Szymanski's
    employment, means the determination is vitiated by an error on a  point
    of law.  This is because if Mrs Szymanski has  never  had  a  right  of
    residence in the UK then Mr Szymanski could not  have  derived  such  a
    right and therefore he has not had permission to work in the UK.  It is
    trite law that an EEA national cannot derive a right of residence as  a
    self sufficient person from illegal earnings.

16. In reaching this conclusion I  have  considered  whether  the  evidence
    rejected by the Secretary of State was in fact sufficient to show  that
    Mrs Szymanski was a self sufficient person prior to her husband finding
    employment.  A simple answer to this is found  in  the  date  when  the
    family obtained "comprehensive sickness insurance".  The evidence  from
    BUPA shows that such cover was provided from 31 October 2013.  At  that
    time the couple accept that they relied  on  Mr  Szymanski's  earnings.
    Even if the family had been reliant on Mr Szymanski's  savings  in  the
    first half of 2013 (and  I  remind  myself  that  the  statements  from
    Redstone Federal Credit Union  have  the  American  date  format),  the
    absence of evidence of comprehensive sickness insurance  at  that  time
    means the requirements for Mrs Szymanski  to  be  regarded  as  a  self
    sufficient person were not met.

17. I add that it would appear that Mr Szymanski was working prior  to  his
    employment with Gateway College.  The HSBC bank statements show  fairly
    regular income from KPPES Ltd from 19 April 2013 onwards.  Although  no
    documentary evidence has been provided, I presume these  entries  refer
    to payments relating to supply teaching, since that is  Mr  Szymanski's
    profession and since it is accepted that Mrs Szymanski was not  working
    at that time  because  she  was  pregnant.   It  is  evident  from  the
    outgoings displayed in the bank statements that  the  couple  supported
    themselves from this income from April 2013 onwards,  which  undermines
    any notion that the family was supported by Mrs Szymanski's savings  at
    that time.

18. The fact that the  evidence  was  not  considered  in  respect  of  the
    relevant question that had to be decided means that I  must  set  aside
    the determination.

Issues to be determined at the resumed hearing

19. It will be necessary to resume the hearing to deal with the above issue
    and any other matters that might be relevant given  that  Judge  Thorne
    did not deal with all the grounds of appeal that were raised before the
    First-tier Tribunal.

20. For convenience I set out the issues that will have to  be  covered  at
    the resumed hearing.

21. The relevant date for evidence will be the date of the resumed hearing.



22. Mrs Szymanski's right of residence as a self sufficient  person  cannot
    be established on the basis of Mr Szymanski's income unless it is shown
    that Mr Szymanski had derived a  right  of  residence  from  her  which
    entitled him to work in the UK under EU law.

23. It will be for Mr Szymanski to show when and how his wife established a
    right of residence as a self sufficient person in the  UK  meeting  the
    requirements of regulation 4(c) of the 2006 EEA Regulations.

24. If the above cannot be established, then it will be for Mr Szymanski to
    pursue the  other  grounds  of  appeal  raised  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, with the following exception: he cannot rely on any  argument
    that the decision was not in accordance with the immigration  rules  or
    that  discretion  exercisable  under  those  rules  should  have   been
    exercised differently.  Those grounds (being the grounds  specified  in
    sections 84(1)(a) and (f) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002) are precluded by paragraph 1 of schedule 1 to  the  2006  EEA
    Regulations.

25. In the alternative, as  mentioned  in  paragraph  8  above,  there  are
    assertions that Mrs Szymanski was intending to work when she arrived in
    the UK in December 2012 and that she is currently working.  No evidence
    to substantiate either assertion has been provided to date.  I am aware
    that the application to the Secretary of State was  not  made  on  this
    basis and the issues appear to  have  been  introduced  at  the  appeal
    stage.  It would also appear that these points were not pursued  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.

26. Mr Szymanski cannot  assume  that  evidence  on  such  issues  will  be
    admitted.  If he provides evidence relating to  these  issues,  I  will
    consider whether to  admit  it  and  in  so  doing  I  will  take  into
    consideration objections from the  Secretary  of  State,  if  any,  and
    whether it would be more appropriate for a fresh application to be made
    rather than to  consider  novel  issues  in  an  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

27. In respect of issues relating to private and family life,  I  add  that
    the parties might refer to the Court of Justice's decision in Dereci  &
    Ors (case no C-256/11) [2011] EUECJ C-256/11; [2012] Imm AR 230 and are
    reminded that the issues might be taken in respect of article 8 of  the
    human rights convention or article 7  of  the  Charter  of  Fundamental
    Rights.

Directions

28. In light of the above issues, it is appropriate to give directions.

29. The parties must file with the Upper Tribunal and serve on  each  other
    any additional documents, on which they will seek to rely, at least  14
    calendar days before the resumed hearing.  Failure to do so may  result
    in such evidence not being admitted.

30. The parties must file with the Upper Tribunal and serve on  each  other
    skeleton arguments dealing with the above issues no  later  than  seven
    calendar days before the resumed hearing.

Decision

    The determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Thorne contains an error
    on a point of law and is set aside.

    The Upper Tribunal  will  arrange  a  resumed  hearing  to  remake  the
    decision.
