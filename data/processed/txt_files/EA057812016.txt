Representation:
For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr J. Staunton, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The Appellant is a national of the Czech Republic, born on 28 August
1977. On 22 February 2016 she applied for a document certifying her
permanent residence in the United Kingdom. This application was refused on
7 May 2016 but on appeal to the First tier Tribunal her appeal was allowed
in a decision promulgated on 18 July 2916, on the basis that, whilst there
were some gaps in the Appellant's work record, the Judge was satisfied that
the Appellant was either working or seeking work during the five year
period preceding her application for permanent residence.

2. The Respondent made an in-time application for permission to appeal on
25 July 2016 on the basis that the Judge materially erred in
misapprehending the Respondent's position, which was that the documents
submitted in support of the application did not support the Appellant's
claimed chronological work history. The Judge thus failed to give adequate
reasons for allowing the appeal. Permission to appeal was granted on 28
October 2016 and at a hearing before a panel of the Upper Tribunal on 21
November 2016, an error of law was found for the reasons set out in the
grounds of appeal and the appeal was adjourned for a resumed hearing.

Hearing

3. On behalf of the Home Office, Mr Staunton fairly accepted that, having
spoken to Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs, he was satisfied that the
Appellant had been working or seeking work continuously for 5 years prior
to making an application for permanent residence. Therefore, he conceded
that the appeal should be allowed.

4. In light of Mr Staunton's helpful concession, I allow the appeal on the
basis that the Appellant had been working or seeking work continuously for
5 years prior to making an application for permanent residence and thus she
satisfies the requirements of regulation 15(1)(a) of the Immigration EEA
Regulations 2006.
