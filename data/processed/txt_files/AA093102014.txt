For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
    respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and
    evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. In order to avoid confusion, the parties are referred to as  they  were
    in the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Thornton promulgated on 20 March  2015  which  dismissed
    the Appellant's appeal against the decision of the Respondent to remove
    the Appellant  from  the  UK  following  the  decision  to  refuse  the
    Appellant's claim for asylum

Background

 4. The Appellant was born on 13 February 1976 and is a national of Russia.

 5. On 29 February 2012 the Appellant and her two children were issued with
    family visit visas valid until 29 August 2012 and then further visas on
    26 April 2013 valid until 26 October 2013. Visits to the UK took place.

 6. On 15 May 2013 they arrived in the UK and although her  husband  had  a
    visa he did not travel with them. The Appellant gave birth to  a  third
    child on 1 July 2013.

 7. On 24 October 2013 the Appellant applied  for  asylum  with  her  three
    children as dependents in essence because the  Appellant  claimed  that
    her and her children were at risk of violence from her husband.

 8. On 25 September 2014 the Secretary of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
    application as he claims in relation to her husband were not accepted.

The Judge's Decision

 9. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  Thornton  ("the  Judge")  dismissed  the  appeal   against   the
    Respondent's decision. The Judge heard oral evidence from the Appellant
    and her sister and also had a bundle of documents before him  which  he
    indicated he took into account. The Judge found :

      a) That the Appellant and her sister were not credible witnesses.

      b) He found her claims to be inconsistent with her immigration history
         of repeated visits to the UK.

      c) He did not find her claim that her husband threatened to  sacrifice
         their third child to Satan was credible given that he agreed to her
         traveling to the UK when pregnant without him.

      d) It was not credible that she would  leave  her  daughter  with  her
         husband when she came to the UK on her first trip given her  claims
         of his violence towards them and her claim that associates  of  his
         had attempted to rape her.

      e) He did not find it credible  that  the  Appellant  would  take  her
         daughter back to Russia in order for her to finish her school  year
         was credible given her claims that she was at risk of violence  and
         rape.

      f) He found her failure to claim asylum until her fourth visit to  the
         UK under mined her credibility.

      g) He also found a number of aspects of her evidence generally  to  be
         incredible and set those out at paragraph 23(i)-(iii)

      h) He found inconsistencies in the Appellants sisters evidence and set
         those out at 24(i)-(iii)

      i) He found that  the  Appellant  and  her  sister  gave  inconsistent
         evidence of messages from the  Appellants  husband  and  set  those
         inconsistencies out in detail

      j) He placed no weight on the letter purportedly from  the  Appellants
         neighbour advanced in support of the alleged rape of  her  daughter
         as it was vague and made no mention of rape but it was also written
         in English and was unsigned.

      k) The medical evidence did not support her claim.

      l) He found that her whole account had been fabricated to support  and
         asylum claim.

10. Grounds of appeal were lodged arguing that:

      a) The Judge had failed to make findings on material evidence, that of
         her daughter.

      b) The Judge failed to make a finding as  to  why  the  Appellant  had
         changed her name and that of her children.

      c) The Judge applied the wrong standard of proof  in  using  the  term
         incredible.

11. On 15 April 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Cadwallader gave  permission
    to appeal in respect of the first two grounds.

12. There is a Rule 24 response in which the Respondent argues that  it  is
    unclear how a finding  in  relation  to  the  name  change  could  have
    impacted on the Judge's decision and that the  Judge  gave  sustainable
    reasons why he found the Appellants account lacking in credibility.

13. At the hearing I heard submissions from Mrs Johnrose on behalf  of  the
    Appellant that:

      a) She acknowledged that there was an issue of  whether  the  failures
         highlighted in the grounds were material to the outcome  given  the
         other credibility findings.

      b) The daughter's evidence was compelling: it was true  that  she  did
         not give oral evidence but this was  because  the  solicitors  felt
         that she was unable to give oral evidence.  Taking into account the
         daughter's evidence may have had an impact on her assessment of the
         Appellants evidence.

      c) In relation to  the  Appellants  name  change  the  Judge  did  not
         consider the relevance of the Appellant having  taken  the  drastic
         step of changing her name because she  was  so  frightened  of  her
         husband finding her.

14. On behalf of the Respondent Mr Harrison submitted that :

      a) He relied on the Rule 24 notice.

      b) The Appellant provided a 15 page witness statement which  contained
         great detail about what she alleged had happened  to  her  and  her
         children during the marriage.

      c) The daughter's witness statement was less  than  ï¿½  page  long  and
         addressed her feelings rather than facts and it took the Appellants
         case no further.

      d) The Appellant may well have told her daughter what she claimed  had
         happened: without the opportunity to cross examine the daughter  it
         was not possible to say whether her account  was  first  or  second
         hand.

      e) The change of name also takes the case no further.

      f) The Judge found a wealth of the  evidence  before  him  not  to  be
         credible.

The Law

15.  Errors  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow  binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account  immaterial   considerations,
    reaching irrational  conclusions  on  facts  or  evaluation  or  giving
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

16. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged. Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail  to
    deal with every factual issue  under  argument.  Disagreement  with  an
    Immigrations Judge's factual conclusions, his appraisal of the evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law. Unless an Immigration  Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken no account of evidence that was not before him..

17.  If  a  point  of  evidence  of  significance  has  been   ignored   or
    misunderstood, that is a  failure  to  take  into  account  a  material
    consideration. In Mibanga v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ  367  Buxton  LJ  said
    this in relation to challenging such findings:

         "Where, as in this case, complaint is made of the reasoning  of  an
         adjudicator in respect of a  question  of  fact  (that  is  to  say
         credibility), particular care  is  necessary  to  ensure  that  the
         criticism is as to the fundamental approach of the adjudicator, and
         does not merely reflect a feeling on  the  part  of  the  appellate
         tribunal that it might itself have taken a different  view  of  the
         matter from that that appealed to the adjudicator."

Finding on Material Error

18. Having heard those submissions,  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    Tribunal made no material errors of law.

19. It is argued that the Judge failed to take into  account  the  evidence
    given by the Appellants daughter  in  refusing  the  appeal  against  a
    refusal of asylum. This raises two issues: did the Judge fail  to  take
    the evidence into account and would that evidence have made a  material
    difference to his decision.

20. In what is a very detailed and carefully  written  decision  the  Judge
    stated at paragraph 7 that he took into account the Appellants  indexed
    and paginated bundle and properly stated that he was  not  required  to
    set out its contents. I see no reason why I should accept that  he  did
    not take into account the daughters letter which formed  part  of  that
    bundle. Even if I am wrong about that I am satisfied that the daughters
    evidence would have made no difference  to  the  outcome  of  the  case
    because it did not address any of the specific facts in  issue  in  the
    case. It was as Mr Harrison noted barely ï¿½ page long; she spoke in very
    vague terms about 'horrible people' who wanted to kill her  family.  It
    did not identify her father as one of these  horrible  people  who  was
    treating her or her brother or mother badly. It did not  refer  to  the
    alleged rape against her or any mistreatment of her brother or anything
    that could have supported her mothers account. While it  was  suggested
    before me that the solicitors had decided that the daughter should  not
    give evidence for medical/psychological reasons there was  no  evidence
    of that before the Judge. Her account therefore, such as  it  was,  was
    untested and therefore taking all of these  factors  into  account  and
    particularly given the numerous adverse credibility  findings  which  I
    have set out at 9(a)-(l) the Judge would have been entitled  to  attach
    little weight to that evidence.

21. In relation to the Judge making no specific finding about the Appellant
    having changed her name and that of her children I  am  satisfied  that
    the Judge is not required to make a finding on every issue in the  case
    unless it was one of significance. I am  satisfied  that  a  change  of
    name, which was arguably a self serving action, was  not  a  matter  of
    significance in this case given the overall core of her claim. Even  if
    I were wrong about this I am satisfied that in the light of the  wealth
    of other adverse credibility findings that no finding  in  relation  to
    this issue would have changed the outcome of the case.

22. I was therefore satisfied that the Judge's determination when read as a
    whole set out findings that were sustainable and sufficiently  detailed
    and based on cogent reasoning.

CONCLUSION

23. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established and  that
    the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

24. The appeal is dismissed.
