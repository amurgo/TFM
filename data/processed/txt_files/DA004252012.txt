Representation:

For the Appellant: Ms Lagunju, instructed by Dorcas Funmi & Co Solicitors.

For the Respondent: Mr Norton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




     1. In a determination promulgated on 5th February 2013 a panel of  the
        First-tier Tribunal ('the Panel') sitting at Taylor House dismissed
        the appellant's appeal against an order  to  deport  him  from  the
        United Kingdom made pursuant to section 32 (5) UK Borders Act 2007.


     2. The appellant's application for permission to appeal  against  that
        decision was initially refused by another judge of  the  First-tier
        Tribunal, but granted, on a renewed application, by Upper  Tribunal
        Judge Chalkley on 11th March 2013.


     3. On 30th May 2013 Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge  Appleyard  found,  on
        the basis of the challenge alleging that the Panel  reached  flawed
        and erroneous conclusions in relation to Article 8 ECHR,  that  the
        Panel had erred. The determination was  set  aside  and  directions
        given for the matter to be heard afresh.


     4. Although Deputy Judge Appleyard directed that there  should  be  no
        preserved findings much of the evidence is not in  dispute  between
        the parties - in particular the  appellant's  immigration  history,
        time in the  United  Kingdom,  childhood  experiences,  and  family
        connections in the UK and Angola.



Background


     5. The appellant was born on the 23rd June 1991 and is  a  citizen  of
        Angola. He is the subject of the deportation order as a  result  of
        his conviction at Woolwich Crown Court for false  imprisonment  and
        blackmail.   Although  there  was  some   dispute   regarding   the
        appellant's culpability for the offence we have  no  reason  to  go
        behind sentencing remarks of HHJ Shorrock:


              Would you stand up please, Ange Mbaki and James  McGowan.  You
   were both           the victim of a confidence trick as a result of which
   a fairly substantial sum of           money, �2000 was lost.  So  it  was
   that you turned to Mboso Ncube, who was an             associate  of  the
   fraudsters but not it seems actually involved.


              In the early hours of the morning you arrived at an address in
   Westgate on Sea              where you, James McGowan, had the use  of  a
   room. There, the victim was               detained against his will for a
   period of about eight hours.


              I accept that he was threatened and I accept that for some  of
   the time he was tied             up with a piece  of  woolly  rope  which
   came from the address.


              I am also satisfied that threats were made to him in  more  or
   less  the  way  in                   which  he  describes.  I  draw  that
   conclusion  principally  because  the  purpose  of  the             false
   imprisonment was to bully him into making good the losses via his mother.


              Accordingly, I  find  that  this  was  not  a  case  of  false
   imprisonment for ransom. He           was actually intimidated to ringing
   her up and attempting to persuade her to  pay            money  into  his
   account but in fact no money actually changed hands.


              I treat both the offences as being part and parcel of the same
   incident and I will              pass concurrent sentences in relation to
   them in due course.


              I do not accept that the victim was punched and kicked in  the
   way he alleged,              nor do I accept that he was assaulted with a
   dog lead. The reason for that is that              the medical  evidence,
   in my view, contradicts what he says happened.


              I found Mbuso  Ncube  in  many  ways  to  be  an  unimpressive
   witness. I am not            sure that attempts were made to  set  a  dog
   upon him and that he was, for a short              while, gagged  with  a
   sponge and hooded with a pillow case. Equally, I am not              sure
   that James McGowan was armed with a knife when the visit  to  the  nearby
     shop was made. It seems to me that by then the victim  had  formed  the
   view  that            cooperation  or  apparent   cooperation   was   the
   appropriate way to react to his           circumstances.


              Nevertheless, false imprisonment  and  blackmail  are  serious
   offences for the             reasons given, in my judgment  the  starting
   point in both cases is one  of  three  and             a  half  years  in
   prison.


     6. HHJ Shorrock sentenced the appellant to  three  years  in  a  Young
        Offenders Institute, concurrent on each count, having allowed a six-
        month discount to reflect a late guilty plea. He also  stated  that
        in his opinion he saw no reason  to  distinguish  between  the  two
        accused in terms of their role or overall responsibility.


     7. This is not the appellant's first offence.


     8. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on 24th January 1995, aged
        three, with his maternal uncle and two minor aunts. An  application
        for asylum was submitted with the appellant as a dependent  of  his
        uncle although at that time he was described as his son rather than
        a nephew.  The application for asylum was refused on 22nd May 1997.
        Further representations were made and the decision  appealed  as  a
        result  of  which  the  original  decision  to  refuse  asylum  was
        withdrawn and Exceptional Leave to Enter granted  until  17th  July
        1999.  The appellant's siblings arrived in the  United  Kingdom  on
        10th June 1999, accompanied by their aunt who was also a  minor  at
        the time. They too were included as dependents of the uncle.


     9. On 15th July 2002 the appellant applied for  Exceptional  Leave  to
        Remain as a dependent of his maternal uncle which  was  granted  to
        the family on 18th December 2002.


    10. On 25th July 2003 Oxfordshire Social  Services  were  contacted  in
        relation to the appellant's welfare and that of  his  siblings  and
        his minor aunt. It was alleged the children had been left alone and
        there were concerns of neglect. The police were called and served a
        Child Protection Order. The children were taken into  care  and  on
        27th July 2003 placed in foster care.


    11. The appellant's mother  arrived  in  the  United  Kingdom  on  26th
        October 2003 accompanied by her daughter in order to participate in
        the Family Court proceedings. She was subsequently granted leave to
        remain until 31st August 2004. She was refused indefinite leave  to
        remain on 13th November 2006 but was granted discretionary leave to
        remain.


    12. The appellant first came to the attention of  the  Police  on  19th
        October 2005 when  he  received  a  reprimand  for  theft.  He  was
        fourteen years of age at that time. He has the following history of
        criminal behaviour:


          19 October 2005           Reprimanded by Thames Valley Police  for
   theft of                              cycle.


          30 May  2006            Convicted  at  Thames  Juvenile  Court  of
   robbery and                               theft from person. He was  made
   subject to a 12                                    month  Referral  Order
   for each offence which was                             later revoked  and
   varied on 15 May 2007.


          15 May 2007           Convicted at Thames Juvenile Court of Common
                                Assault. The previous referral  orders  were
   revoked                               and varied to a  Supervision  Order
   for a period of 18                             months.  In  addition  the
   appellant was made subject                             to a curfew  order
   for  two  months  with  electronic                                tagging
   between    20:00    -    06:00     hrs     and     ordered     to     pay
   �100 compensation.


          31 May  2007            Convicted  at  Thames  Juvenile  Court  of

   months.

   He was  given  a  three                                month  Supervision
   Order (Young Offenders) and                            was  made  subject
   to             a             six             hours              Community
   Rehabilitation     Order.     He     was      also      convicted      at
        Oxford    Juvenile     Court     of     breaching     a     previous
       conditional   discharge.   No   further   action   was    taken    in
          this regard.


          16 April 2008             Convicted at Oxford  Juvenile  Court  of
   common                                assault. He was made subject  to  a
   supervision order                              for  three  months  and  a

          10 September 2008         Convicted at Oxford  Juvenile  Court  of

   fined �15.


          22 October 2008           Convicted at Oxford Magistrates Court of

   The  drugs   were   fortified.                                Conditional
   discharge for 12 months.


          20 December  2010       Convicted  at  Basildon  Crown  Court  for
   assault                                   occasioning actual bodily  harm
   and  theft  from                                       person.   He   was
   sentenced to six months  and  three                                months
   imprisonment              respectively               to               run
   consecutively at a Young Offenders Institute.


          12 August 2011            Convicted at  Woolwich  Crown  Court  of
   false                                   imprisonment    and    blackmail.
   Appellant   sentenced    to                                three    years
   imprisonment        for        each        offence         to         run
   concurrently in a Young Offenders Institution.


    13. On 10th March 2008 an application for registration of the appellant
        as a British citizen was received but refused on 23rd April 2008 on
        character grounds and as a result of his criminal record.


    14. On 6th March 2009 his mother gave birth to  another  child  in  the
        United Kingdom and on 15th December 2009 she  applied  for  further
        leave to remain for herself and her two youngest daughters.


    15. The liability for deportation letter was  issued  on  14th  October
        2011 which resulted in further representations and  material  being
        submitted to the Secretary of  State.  The  deportation  order  was
        signed on 27th June 2012 and forwarded to HMP Rochester on the same
        date for service.


    16. We have  also  had  the  opportunity  of  considering  an  Offender
        Assessment  Report  (OASys)  prepared  by  the  National  Probation
        Service on 8th June 2012 whilst the appellant was at HMP Rochester.
        The concerns the author of the report has regarding the  appellants
        future conduct are reflected in the section of the document setting
        out any licence requirements, if he was  to  be  released,  in  the
        following terms:


              To permanently reside at Thames Valley  Approved  Premise  and
   must not leave               to reside elsewhere,  even  for  one  night,
   without obtaining  the  prior  approval  of             your  supervising
   officer;  thereafter  must  reside  as  directed  by   your   supervising
   officer.


              Report to staff at a Thames Valley Approved Premise at  09.00,
   12.00, 15.00 and             17.00, unless otherwise authorised  by  your
   supervising officer. This condition           will be  reviewed  by  your
   supervising officer on a fortnightly basis and may  be            amended
   or removed if it is felt the  level  of  risk  you  present  has  reduced
     appropriately.


              Confine yourself to an address approved  by  your  supervising
   officer between the              hours of 21.00 and  07.00  daily  unless
   otherwise  authorised  by  your   supervising             officer.   This
   condition  will  be  reviewed  by   your   supervising   officer   on   a
   fortnightly basis and may be amended or removed if it is  felt  that  the
   level of risk           that you present has reduced appropriately.


              Not  to  contact  or  associate  with  James  McGowan,  Graeme
   McGowan, Andre               Dunkley and John Flateau without  the  prior
   approval of your supervising officer.


              To comply with any requirements specified by your  supervising
   officer for the              purpose of ensuring that  you  address  your
   offending behaviour problems at the           Thinking Skills  Programme.




    17. The appellant's automatic release date was 29th June 2012  although
        he remains in detention.  His facility licence  expiry  eligibility
        date is 8th December 2013.


    18. In relation to the offence it is recorded that it does  not  appear
        the appellant was the lead, nor that he was  easily  influenced  by
        others. He admits he  was  jointly  involved  and  jointly  made  a
        decision to offend although it is recorded that he  stated  to  the
        Probation Officer that Mr Flateau "took it too far" when he used  a
        knife to injure the victim [2.7]. In relation to  the  extent  that
        the  appellant  accepted  responsibility  for  the  offence  it  is
        recorded that he accepts he is guilty of false imprisonment in that
        although he claimed the door to the accommodation was unlocked  the
        victim was threatened with violence and was too scared to leave the
        property. The appellant is stated to have admitted in interview  "I
        gave him a couple of slaps ....  I  wasn't  gonna  let  him  leave"
        [2.11]


    19. In relation to his conduct in detention the author  of  the  report
        notes:

              "Information from  the  prison  shows  that  there  have  been
concerns regarding Mr           Mbaki's affiliation with gangs and  that  he
has received three adjudications for              fighting  and  threatening
behaviour related to gang rivalry. The most recent              adjudication
on  04/04/12  for  fighting  resulted  in  21  days  custody  being   added,
delaying his release date to 29/06/12.  Mr Mbaki has  been  recommended  for
         deportation therefore he may be detained further after this date"


    20. In section 7  of  the  report,  in  which  the  author  deals  with
        lifestyle and associates, the issue of the appellant's  involvement
        in gangs is further mentioned in the following terms:


              "There have been previous concerns that Mr Mbaki was  involved
   with gangs in           London as a teenager and there have been  periods
   of his childhood where his            whereabouts have been unknown.   In
   2007, Mr Mbaki was stabbed following an            incident at  a  party,
   which was perceived to be a gang related incident. Reports           from
   the prison suggest that he is affiliated with the " London Fields "  gang
   and             he has been involved in gang related violence  whilst  in
   custody, which  also               necessitated  a  prison  transfer  and
   restricted  movements  around  HMP  Rochester               where  he  is
   currently held. Mr Mbaki has had  at  least  three  proven  adjudications
     for fighting and threatening behaviour linked to gang rivalry including
                  threatening to place a tin of tuna in a sock and use  this
   to assault the first rival            gang member he saw.  He  also  told
   staff that he would have no problem gouging            out  the  eyes  of
   someone  from  a  rival  gang.   In   September   2011   Mr   Mbaki   was
   assaulted by 10 other prisoners in the exercise yard.


              The current offences  demonstrate  manipulative  and  reckless
   behaviour in that            Mr Mbaki blackmailed the victim and held him
   against his will. Mr Mbaki                admits that he has in the  past
   associated with criminal peers and that he has              become easily
   distracted  by  crime  when  he  is  not  in  employment.  He   describes
   himself as "troublesome" when he was younger but states that  he  is  now
           motivated  to  lead  a  pro-social  lifestyle  and  refrain  from
   associating  with  negative               peers.   However,   given   the
   information above regarding gang-related violence           this does not
   appear to the case and  he  is  continuing  to  associate  with  criminal
   peers and gang members in custody"


    21. The report accepts there is no  indication  that  drug  or  alcohol
        misuse is linked to offending and no adverse  reports  relating  to
        the appellant's  emotional  well-being  or  suicide  or  self  harm
        attempts. In section 10.8 the author notes the appellant states  he
        is anxious about the prospects of deportation  although  is  coping
        well.


    22. In relation to thinking/behavioural issues, at section  11  of  the
        report, the author records the following:


              "Mr Mbaki claims that he becomes easily distracted when he  is
   not in                       employment or has free time and  he  accepts
   that he has  in  the  past  spent  most  of               his  time  with
   offending  peers.  He  used   the   threat   of   violence   during   the
   commission of this offence in an attempt to get back money  that  he  had
   lost in a           "dodgy deal". Mr Mbaki has previous  convictions  for
   violence against  others  and            accepts  that  he  has  shown  a
   tendency  to  confront  people  when  feeling  threatened              or
   provoked, however, he states that he  can  let  some  things  go  without
   feeling             the need to use violence. Whilst in  custody  he  has
   continued to use violence,            mainly against those  he  perceives
   to be from a rival gang. He has made threats  to              rival  gang
   members  via  members  of  staff  and  does  not  appear  to  acknowledge
   the consequences of this, in terms of adjudications for himself and  harm
   caused              to other prisoners. His cell sharing risk  assessment
   is high.


              Mr Mbaki displays no empathy for the victim of  this  offence,
   stating that the             victim lied and showed no sympathy  for  him
   and the other people who had lost             out due  to  the  jewellery
   deal.  He  states  that  it  is  the   victim's   fault   that   he   was
   initially  classified  as  a  category  A  prisoner  due  to  the  victim
   mentioning seeing            guns in his Police statement.  Mr Mbaki also
   justified his behaviour by stating            that  "other  people  would
   have done the same". It is my assessment  is  that  Mr              Mbaki
   would benefit from completing the Thinking Skills  Programme  during  his
     licence period to improve his thinking skills."




    23.  The  propensity  to  blame  others  for  his  conviction  and  his
        description of violence appearing to indicate that he views this as
        being fairly  commonplace  is  noted  in  section  12  relating  to
        "attitudes".  It is also noted  that  the  appellant  continues  to
        engage in criminal activity whilst in custody and does  not  adhere
        to that regime which is of concern when he is released on  licence.
        It is also noted he has previously breached conditional  discharges
        by the commission  of  further  offences  and  has  demonstrated  a
        reluctance to work with professionals. The author acknowledges that
        the appellant has stated he will adhere to his licence  because  he
        has to, but he has not demonstrated  any  commitment  further  than
        this.


    24. In the section of the report in which the author assesses the  risk
        of harm posed by the appellant concerns are recorded in relation to
        escape/absconding based upon his past history of remaining  out  of
        touch with  professionals  and  moving  between  locations  without
        informing relevant agencies. It is  said  that  if  he  is  granted
        immigration bail he may abscond due to the  threat  of  deportation
        and previous transient lifestyle.  Concerns are  also  recorded  in
        relation to control issues/disruptive behaviour and in  respect  of
        breach of trust. He is assessed as posing a risk to other prisoners
        and his risk of reoffending is assessed as "high" [R4.4].


    25. In section R10, there is a summary of the risk of serious  harm  as
        follows:


          Who is at risk: Members of the public and prisoners - mainly rival
   gang           members or those perceived to be such by Mr Mbaki.   These
   are usually young       adult/teens males.  Known  adult  -  the  victim,
   Mbusio Ncube - Mr Mbaki               continues to display anger  towards
   the victim.


          What is the  nature  of  the  risk:  physical  violence/threat  of
   violence/ false              imprisonment - could result in physical harm
   and long term emotional  trauma.        Possible  use  of  an  improvised
   weapon.


          When is the risk likely to be greatest: the risk continues  to  be
   imminent whether        in custody or on release - Mr Mbaki has continued
   to behave violently to other           prisoners  and  had  made  threats
   about harming members of rival gangs.  He is        affiliated  with  the
   "London Fields" gang and even when transferred to another       prison he
   soon established links and became involved  in  gang  violence.   In  the
   community it is likely that Mr  Mbaki  would  try  to  establish  further
   links,              particularly in London, although he may  do  this  in
   other cities.


    26. We have referred to the above in some detail as it  relates  to  an
        issue that arose during  the  course  of  the  hearing.  Mr  Norton
        produced an addition  bundle  containing  evidence  from  Detective
        Constable O'Donnell and  Police  Constable  Thornton  of  Operation
        Nexus which is a partnership between the  Metropolitan  Police  and
        UKBA. In accordance with the guidance given by the  Upper  Tribunal
        case of Farquhason [2013] UKUT 146 both officers  prepared  witness
        statements and corroborated the information contained in the  same,
        relating to the appellant's alleged  conduct  and  his  associates,
        with copies of crime reports and printouts from the Police National
        Computer (PNC).


    27. The statement of D.C. O'Donnell also refers to the Crime  Reporting
        Information System (CRIS) and to crime reports including those from
        two Constabularies outside London, namely Thames Valley  and  Essex
        Police, which summarise ten convictions for seventeen offences  for
        the appellant, as detailed above, and also ten non-convictions  for
        ten offences as follows:


          Assault occasioning actual bodily harm               2006


          Rape of female                                  2008


          Aggravated burglary                         2009


          Possession of cannabis (Class B controlled drug)     2009


          Theft from person; False imprisonment           2009


          Burglary and theft dwelling; false imprisonment      2010


          Robbery                                     2010


          Robbery                                     2010.


          The record shows that the appellant has not guilty  disposals  for
   five offences       including assault occasioning actual bodily  harm  in
   2007, kidnapping,            wounding with intent to do  grievous  bodily
   harm,  having  an  imitation  firearm          with  intent   to   commit
   indictable offence and having an imitation firearm with         intent to
   commit an indictable offence in 2010.


    28. Before we can accept  the  same  as  establishing  the  appellant's
        conduct we have to be satisfied that the allegations are  supported
        by evidence to which we can give due weight.  In  relation  to  the
        11th November 2008 rape  allegation  the  statement  indicates  the
        victim, who  was  16  years  of  age,  stayed  overnight  with  the
        appellant and fell asleep on a bed in the premises  fully  clothed.
        She had been drinking. She told the police that when she woke  from
        sleep she discovered that her tracksuit bottoms and  underwear  had
        been removed without her consent and that she felt that intercourse
        had occurred, again to which she did  not  consent.  The  appellant
        admitted during interview being with the victim on that evening and
        that he digitally penetrated the victim and also inserted a part of
        his penis into her vagina, but stated that it  was  consensual.  He
        denied rape. The CPS decided not to charge due to the fact  it  was
        one person's word against the other. The case  was  reviewed  by  a
        Detective  Chief  Inspector  who  conducted  a  full  case   review
        resulting in Thames Valley Police appealing the decision of the CPS
        stating it was in the public interest to  proceed  and  that  their
        belief that was the case should go before a jury and not be decided
        by the CPS prior to charge. The CPS  decision  noted  that  it  was
        accepted there was enough to grant the  appeal  but  they  did  not
        believe that it was in the public interest and so no further action
        was taken.


    29. In relation to the aggravated burglary on 27th February 2009,  this
        occurred in Oxford when the appellant and others are said  to  have
        approached a residential address and  forced  entry.   One  of  the
        accomplices entered the property with a  knife  having  forced  the
        door open. The occupants were all asleep in  bed.   An  altercation
        occurred with the  occupant  during  which  the  intruder  received
        several wounds; three lacerations  to  shoulder,  and  one  to  his
        stomach. The group fled  and  the  intruder  was  treated  at  John
        Radcliffe Hospital for stab  wounds.  The  appellant  was  arrested
        together with four others at the hospital; but on 31st  April  2009
        Oxford Police made a decision that no further action will be  taken
        against him  or  his  associates  on  the  basis  that  the  injury
        sustained by the intruder was as a result of self  defence  by  the
        house occupier.  On 5th May 2009  the  intruder  was  sentenced  to
        three years imprisonment at Oxford Crown Court  for  conspiracy  to
        commit robbery as the intruder in the incident.


    30. On 2nd September 2009 for criminal damage the appellant received  a
        fixed penalty notice as a result of throwing stones and rubble at a
        window of a house occupied by an  individual  that  he  had  argued
        with, causing it to smash, and a further fixed  penalty  notice  on
        28th October 2009 for criminal damage as a result  of  his  causing
        damage to a letter box which the appellant claimed  he  did  whilst
        attempting to ascertain whether the resident was at home.


    31. It can therefore be seen that the appellant admitted some of  those
        incidents referred to in the police report which are  supported  by
        the existence of cautions or credible police records.  He  admitted
        penetration of the young girl in the early offence although claimed
        it was consensual which was denied. The fact the Police  sought  to
        appeal the CPS decision regarding whether charges should be brought
        indicates that they considered there was strong evidence worthy  of
        putting before a jury that the action was not  consensual  and  may
        have been opportunistic.


    32. There is also evidence of  named  individuals  being  charged  with
        offences in their own right and evidence of individuals  with  whom
        the appellant has associated. The appellant was  asked  about  such
        associations by  his  barrister  during  the  course  of  his  oral
        evidence. He claimed not to know  an  individual  by  the  name  of
        Damien Dean, Jonathan Kindoki he claimed he knew from college  and,
        although he was arrested with him at the John  Radcliffe  Hospital,
        he alleged that he only accompanied him to the hospital and had  no
        knowledge of him prior to going to the hospital.   Dalgo  Mosa  the
        appellant claimed he did not know personally but  admitted  he  was
        there when he was arrested for aggravated burglary.  He  claims  to
        have been at school with his brother.


    33. Various other names were put to the appellant, which we do not need
        to set out in detail in  relation  to  whom  the  appellant  either
        claimed they were friends or school associates.  Some  he  admitted
        were involved in the false imprisonment offence which  led  to  the
        deportation order. In relation to the ten non-convictions  he  also
        admitted that some of them were familiar although he had  not  been
        charged or convicted for those offences.


    34. In relation to Damien Dean the appellant, in cross-examination, was
        referred to an incident of fraud by false representation  following
        the removal of high-value jacket and the replacing of the price-tag
        with one of lower value at a shopping centre when  he  was  charged
        with the offence with Damien Dean.  The appellant acknowledged that
        this had occurred,  which  resulted  in  the  10th  September  2008
        conviction at Oxford Juvenile Court, and that he was  with  another
        person but claimed he did not know who this person was. We  do  not
        find this plausible.


    35. In relation to Jonathan Kindoki the appellant claimed not  to  know
        why this person was at the hospital that evening  and  then  stated
        that another person may have mentioned that it was as a  result  of
        the aggravated burglary. The appellant claimed he was  not  at  the
        property when the person who was taken to hospital was stabbed  but
        admitted being arrested at the hospital. We are not satisfied  that
        his evidence provided a credible explanation for why he was at  the
        hospital with a  group  of  individuals  following  the  aggravated
        burglary which resulted in one of  them  requiring  urgent  medical
        treatment if he had nothing to do with the events of that night  or
        with the named individuals. We find on balance it was more  likely,
        as the police statement implies, that the appellant was a member of
        the group that went to the property and who committed, as  a  joint
        enterprise, the burglary although we accept there  is  no  evidence
        that the appellant used a knife or had any weapon on him.


    36. The appellant confirmed  that  he  studied  French  at  school  and
        accepted there have been adjudications in custody for fighting  but
        denied any gang membership. His denial of any gang involvement  was
        consistent throughout  his  evidence,  but  we  do  not  find  this
        credible, which casts doubt upon the reliability of his evidence as
        a whole as a result of the clear statements  in  the  OASys  report
        relating to gang associates both within the community  and  in  the
        prison environment and also in part based upon the appellant's  own
        evidence. Although it was submitted by Ms Lagunju that there was no
        evidence of gang membership at page 53 of his own bundle is a  copy
        of a report from the Early Years and Family Support Team  noting  a
        number of concerns having been brought to the author's attention in
        relation to the  risk  of  significant  harm  being  posed  to  the
        appellant as a result of:


              i.  Him stating he is involved in a gang.


              ii. Stating he has been threatened.


              iii.     Him being excluded from school as  he  was  found  in
   possession of a                  knife - which it is suspected he carries
   for protection although he will               not admit this.


          This entry has a date of a meeting on  15th  June  2007  when  the
   appellant was       fifteen years of age.


    37. An entry dated  10th  February  2007  from  Oxford  County  Council
        Emergency Duty Team refers  to  threats  to  the  appellant's  life
        caused by violent attacks by pupils at his school, one was  stabbed
        and another hit over the head  with  a  hammer  and  stabbed.   The
        appellant is said to be high on the list as their next  target,  as
        he is unpopular with his peers. On the same date is reference to  a
        fax containing essential information to  the  Emergency  Duty  Team
        background details in which it is noted "Ange has  been  threatened
        to be killed by youths in London. He is in a gang".  A copy of  the
        fax is at page 78 of the appellant's bundle including a  note  that
        it  is  recommended  he  not  be  returned  to  London  after   the
        endorsement regarding gang membership.  At page  81  is  a  further
        form containing  information  for  an  Emergency  Duty  Team  again
        recording the appellant's gang membership.


    38. There is also a note dated 18th April 2005 from Oxfordshire  County
        Council recording the appellant being involved  in  a  fight  after
        school, that he hangs around with a gang and is involved in  hiding
        a knife and possibly stealing a knife and passing it on.


    39. When we indicated to his representative that there was evidence  to
        corroborate the claim of gang membership  we  were  faced  with  an
        interesting submission by Ms Lagunju  that  we  should  put  little
        weight  on  this  evidence  and  in  fact  ignore  it.   Whilst  we
        understand that this was the only submission that could be made  it
        was effectively the appellant's own advocate asking  us  to  ignore
        his  own  evidence  that  he  had  relied  upon  throughout   these
        proceedings just because it undermined his claim and  supported  an
        important element of the Secretary  of  States  case.   We  do  not
        accede to such request as it is evidence from a professional source
        and when this is taken together with the evidence provided  by  the
        Metropolitan Police, and  the  evidence  contained  in  the  report
        repaired by the Probation Service, a clear  picture  emerges  of  a
        young man who has been involved in  gangs,  associated  with  named
        individuals, and committed a number of offences involving  acts  of
        violence as outlined in the police intelligence and record  of  his
        convictions.  We find such involvement to be proved.



Discussion



    40.   In   Masih   (deportation   -    public    interest    -    basic
        principles) Pakistan [2012] UKUT 00046(IAC)  the Tribunal said that
        so long as account is taken  of  the  following  basic  principles,
        there is at present no need for further citation  of  authority  on
        the public interest side of the balancing exercise.  The  following
        basic  principles  can  be  derived  from  the  present  case   law
        concerning the issue of the public  interest  in  relation  to  the
        deportation of foreign  criminals:  (i)  In  a  case  of  automatic
        deportation, full account  must  be  taken  of  the  strong  public
        interest  in  removing  foreign  citizens  convicted  of  serious
        offences, which lies not only in the prevention of further offences
        on the part of the individual concerned, but  in  deterring  others
        from committing them  in  the  first  place.  (ii)  Deportation  of
        foreign  criminals  expresses  society's  condemnation  of  serious
        criminal activity and promotes public confidence in  the  treatment
        of foreign citizens who have committed them. (iii)   The  starting-
        point for assessing the facts of the offence of which an individual
        has been committed, and their effect on others, and on  the  public
        as a whole, must be the view taken by the  sentencing  judge.  (iv)
        The appeal has to be dealt with on the basis of  the  situation  at
        the date of the hearing. (v) Full account should also be taken  of
        any developments since sentence was passed, for example the  result
        of any disciplinary adjudications in prison or  detention,  or  any
        OASys or licence report.


    41.  Applying  the  case  law  to  the  above  factors,  including  the
        assessment that the appellant poses a high risk of reoffending, the
        Secretary of State has a strong case for  deporting  the  appellant
        based upon the need to protect the public from  the  commission  of
        future crimes.


    42.  It  is  still  necessary  to  consider  whether  the   appellant's
        deportation is proportionate which we can do only by  weighing  the
        factors in his favour against the Secretary  of  States  case.   In
        Boultif v Switzerland [2001] ECHR 54273, as confirmed by Uner v the
        Netherlands [2007] Imm AR 303, the Court  said  that  in  order  to
        assess whether an expulsion measure was necessary in  a  democratic
        society and  proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim  pursued,  the
        following criteria had to be considered:


              (i) The nature and the seriousness of the offence committed by
   the                     Appellant;
              (ii)     The length of the Appellant's  stay  in  the  country
   from which he or                 she was to be expelled;
              (iii)    The time that  had  elapsed  since  the  offence  was
   committed and the                claimant's conduct during that period.
              (iv)     The nationalities of the various parties concerned;
              (v) The  Appellant's  family  situation,  such  as  length  of
   marriage and                 other factors expressing  the  effectiveness
   of the Appellant's family                 life;
              (vi)     Whether the spouse knew about the offence at the time
   he or she               entered into the family relationship;
              (vii)    Whether there are children in the marriage and if  so
   their ages;
              (viii)   The seriousness and the difficulties which the Spouse
   is likely to                 encounter in the country of the  Appellant's
   origin;
              (ix)     The best interests and well being of any children  of
   the Appellant;                   and in particular the seriousness of any
   difficulties that they would                  be likely to  encounter  in
   the country to which the Appellant would               be expelled;
              (x)      The solidity of social, cultural and family ties with
   the host country                 and with the country of destination.


    43.  In Maslov v Austria (Applic. 1638/03) EctHR  (First  section)  the
        appellant, who had been legally resident in Austria  for  11  years
        with family had a string of convictions.  He was served with a  ten
        year ban.  The EctHR First Chamber said that in  assessing  whether
        the  Austrian  authorities  struck  a  fair  balance  between   the
        claimant's right to family and private life and the  prevention  of
        disorder and crime, the relevant criteria were (i) the  nature  and
        gravity of the claimant's offences (ii) the length of his  stay  in
        the host  country  (iii)  the  period  which  elapsed  between  the
        commission of  the  offences  and  the  impugned  measure  and  the
        claimant's conduct during that period and (iv) the solidity of  the
        social, cultural and family ties with  the  host  country  and  the
        country of destination.


    44. Although the appellant has been in the United Kingdom since he  was
        very young we note that the offence which led  to  the  deportation
        order was committed when he was an adult at 18 years of  age.  When
        considering the criteria set out above we find as follows:


    45. The nature and the seriousness of  the  offence  committed  by  the
        Appellant:  the  appellant  committed  a  serious   offence   which
        represents an escalation in his  criminal  behaviour.  His  conduct
        outside the offences for  which  he  was  convicted  illustrates  a
        propensity to offend and cause  serious  harm  to  members  of  the
        public.


    46. The length of the Appellant's stay in the country from which he  or
        she was to be expelled: we accept that the appellant  has  been  in
        the United Kingdom from a very early age and that he has  grown  up
        within his uncle's family and the care system, been educated in the
        United Kingdom, and is to all effects the same as his peers who are
        British citizens in  terms  of  his  experiences  and  how  he  has
        developed both in a physical and  emotional  sense  and  integrated
        into society in the United Kingdom. The  OASys  report  notes  that
        during 2002 he spent some of his time in care before  being  placed
        on a full care order in 2005 which expired when he turned 18  years
        of age.  He is said to have  absconded  from  a  number  of  foster
        placements between 2004 and 2007 when he returned to Oxford  to  be
        with  his  mother.  He  thereafter   obtained   Key   2   supported
        accommodation but soon began staying at family and  friends  houses
        and allowed others to use his supported accommodation at  a  result
        of which this was closed in April 2009. In June 2009  he  moved  to
        Wembley in London due to harassment and threats being made  against
        him by associates due to an alleged burglary, a move  supported  by
        Thames Valley Police. The appellant did not stay  at  the  property
        and did not provide paperwork needed or  attend  necessary  housing
        appointments and gave various 'care of' addresses in London  before
        returning to live with his mother in Oxford in August 2009.


          The appellant sought advice  from  his  Leaving  Care  Worker  who
   arranged for        him to move to Brent in London as he claimed to be in
   fear of associates in            Oxford and perceived himself  to  be  at
   risk. He was granted temporary            accommodation in a flat but did
   not spend any time there, did not pay service          charges and failed
   to  meet  support   sessions   as   a   result   which   he   lost   that
   tenancy. He claimed to have been staying with friends  and  then  with  a
     girlfriend in Southend-on-Sea. He then lost contact  with  his  Leaving
   Care           Worker who later  discovered  he  had  been  arrested  and
   remanded in custody          which led to his conviction for the  current
   offence.


    47. The time that had elapsed since the offence was committed  and  the
        claimant's conduct during that period: the dates of the convictions
        are set out above as are the adjudications for fighting in  prison,
        the threats  made,  and  the  concerns  regarding  the  appellant's
        conduct both in prison and in the wider community.


    48. The nationalities of the various parties concerned:  the  appellant
        is an Angolan citizen.


    49. The Appellant's family situation, such as length  of  marriage  and
        other factors  expressing  the  effectiveness  of  the  Appellant's
        family life: we do not find it proved that the appellant has family
        life recognised by Article 8 with his uncle  or  any  other  family
        members in the United Kingdom,  although  they  form  part  of  his
        private life. We heard oral evidence from two members of his family
        who clearly support him in his attempt  to  remain  in  the  United
        Kingdom. Whilst we accept such family support exists we do not find
        it has  been  shown  that  the  appellant  retains  the  degree  of
        dependency upon his family members to allow us to find that  family
        life recognised by Article 8 exists. The appellant  has  in  effect
        been living an independent life for some time as  evidence  of  his
        conduct and accommodation provision in and outside the care  system
        indicates. He is not married and there is  no  evidence  of  family
        life with a girlfriend or any other individual sufficient to engage
        Article 8.


    50. Whether the spouse knew about the offence at the  time  he  or  she
        entered into the family relationship: not relevant as there  is  no
        spouse.


    51. Whether there are children in the marriage and if  so  their  ages:
        the appellant has no children.


    52. The seriousness and the difficulties which the Spouse is likely  to
        encounter in the country of the Appellant's origin:  The  appellant
        is a single man.


    53. The best interests and well being of any children of the Appellant;
        and in particular the seriousness of  any  difficulties  that  they
        would be likely to encounter in the country to which the  Appellant
        would be expelled: there are no children.


    54. The solidity of social, cultural and  family  ties  with  the  host
        country  and  with  the  country  of  destination:  we  accept  the
        appellant has strong cultural,  social,  and  family  ties  to  the
        United Kingdom as this is the country he has grown up in and he  is
        not likely to have realistic memories of Angola or  any  experience
        of that country. It is a country with which he is not  familiar  as
        he did not grow up there, although he  has  his  mother  and  other
        family members there.


    55. It is on this aspect of the criteria that Ms  Lagunju  concentrated
        her submissions.  It is accepted that when  the  appellant  entered
        the care system his mother travelled from Angola to be involved  in
        the family proceedings and provided support for him and,  when  she
        had accommodation, to offer a home as an alternative to his  having
        to go into care. The appellant's uncle  Mr  Zeta  stated  that  she
        encountered difficulties in the form of language  as  she  did  not
        speak English, the unfamiliar environment and culture, which had an
        adverse effect on her ability to resume the care of  her  children.
        Although the appellant returned to  live  with  his  mother  it  is
        stated their relationship broke down which culminated in  a  number
        of changes to the appellant's placement.


    56. Mr Zeta claims that the appellant  has  no  family  connections  in
        Angola as the entire family are in the UK and that  they  have  not
        returned to the country due to persecution  they  suffered  in  the
        past, as a result of which it would be highly unlikely they will be
        able to visit the appellant if he was returned. He claims  that  it
        is unlikely  there  will  be  anybody  to  support  and  guide  the
        appellant back in Angola and that he would find it difficult as  he
        cannot speak Portuguese and  will  struggle  to  survive  upon  the
        streets of Luanda without assistance from the government and may be
        at risk of harming himself.


    57. The appellant's aunt, Mrs Templer, also stated  that  in  2003  her
        sister, the  appellant's  mother,  arrived  from  Angola  with  the
        intention  of  taking  custody  of  the  children,  including   the
        appellant, which resulted in a shared parental responsibility order
        with the local authority and a placement  with  her  in  2004.  The
        children  were  separated  us  a  result  of  placements  and   the
        appellant's mother was frustrated as she found the appellant to  be
        unruly and stubborn which led to an estrangement and eventually  to
        her returning to Angola.  Mrs Templer  also  claims  she  would  be
        worried as the appellant will suffer a lot of hardship in Angola as
        life is difficult there and he will have nobody to support him or a
        system for adapting to the strange life he will meet. In  her  oral
        evidence she repeated the claim there has been no contact with  the
        appellant's mother since she returned, claiming in addition, not to
        know where  the  appellant's  mother  was  and  that  she  had  not
        contacted family members herself since her return.


    58. In relation to the claim that the appellant will find it  difficult
        to adapt to life in  Angola  we  accept  that  he  will  experience
        problems in an alien environment and that some of these may be very
        difficult for  him  to  overcome.  He  states  he  does  not  speak
        Portuguese, the language of Angola, and that as  a  result  of  the
        time he has spent in the United Kingdom he  has  no  experience  of
        growing up in that country, which will make it more  difficult  for
        him. We note he studied French at school although even  if  he  has
        the ability to learn Portuguese it is unlikely he  will  develop  a
        practical working knowledge of Portuguese within the timescale  the
        Secretary of State would allow him to remain in the United  Kingdom
        if his appeal is dismissed.


    59. The First-tier Panel did not accept  that  the  appellant  will  be
        abandoned by his mother if he is returned to Angola  based  on  the
        fact that she was willing to travel to the United Kingdom  to  take
        part in the care proceedings and to offer him  a  home  previously.
        Based upon her past conduct this is not a  perverse  or  irrational
        conclusion. It is claimed the mother has now returned to Angola and
        that she and the appellant have become estranged but this does  not
        mean that she would abandon him in her  own  country  where  issues
        such as language and the cultural surroundings are things that  she
        is familiar with. It is claimed there is no contact with the mother
        although the evidence did not suggest that any  real  efforts  have
        been made to contact her, either directly through established means
        of communication, through individuals within her home village which
        must be known to the family, or through the International Red Cross
        or other  non-government  organisations.  Similarly,  there  is  no
        evidence that if the appellant was returned he would be  completely
        abandoned by the family.


    60. If the appellant's mother was to be located and willing to  provide
        him with support and guidance in  Angola  he  will  have  a  family
        member there to support  him.  We  have,  however,  considered  the
        alternative on the basis  that  no  such  family  support  will  be
        available; but we do not find that this  element  and  any  related
        difficulties the appellant may face  is  determinative.  There  are
        established cases  where  individuals  have  lived  in  the  United
        Kingdom for considerable periods of their lives and been removed to
        their countries of origin and where the  European  Court  of  Human
        Rights has accepted that such action is proportionate. The issue is
        fact specific.


    61.  The  submission  that  if  returned  the  appellant  will   suffer
        difficulties sufficient to make his deportation unlawful in  effect
        amounts to an Article 3 issue, as accepted by  Ms  Lagunju  in  the
        course of her submissions.


    62. In Bosnja [2002] UKIAT 07605 the Tribunal said that the  conditions
        which an appellant faced on return to her home country, such  as  a
        lack or inadequacy of medical facilities, could constitute  inhuman
        or degrading treatment.  In principle, Article 3 is not confined to
        treatment at the hands of the authorities in the receiving  country
        although in N (Burundi) [2003] UKIAT 00065 the Tribunal  said  that
        where the humanitarian situation is poor in the country to which  a
        failed asylum seeker is to be returned  that  in  itself  will  not
        generally reach the high threshold needed for a breach  of  Article
        3.  The Tribunal was guided by the approach  in  SK*  [2002]  UKIAT
        05613 (Collins J)  in  which  the  Tribunal  acknowledged  that  an
        individual's personal circumstances could be relevant (eg if he had
        a physical or mental disability) but, nonetheless, "there must be a
        threshold which is of general application. Croatia has suffered the
        ravages of a fierce and bitter civil war.  Thus the mere fact  that
        there will be a return  to  hardship  resulting  from  that  cannot
        produce a breach of human rights."


    63. The general situation must be taken into account as  must  what  is
        generally accepted in the society in question.  In Ibrahim  v  SSHD
        [2005] EWCA Civ 1816 the Adjudicator found that a highly vulnerable
        Somali with very poor cognitive skills who could not in consequence
        fend for herself or avail herself of protection was at  risk  under
        Article 3 and the Court of Appeal upheld this.


    64. A more recent decision is MB and others [2013]  EWHC  123  (Admin):
        where Mr Justice Mitting held:


              24. Strasbourg applies different tests to applications brought
   in respect of treatment by                a  member  state  against  that
   state   from   those   which   it   applies   to   "foreign   cases"    -
   those in which a member state proposing to remove  a  person  to  another
   state may               be in breach of its obligations to that person by
   reason of circumstances which will                 arise  in  that  other
   state. In Article  3  cases  about  conditions  in  a  member  state,  an
     applicant is required to prove to a  high  standard  that  he  will  be
   subjected to                     inhuman or degrading treatment. It  must
   be proved "beyond reasonable doubt":               Ireland v.  UK  [1978]
   2EHRR  25  �  161.   Presumptions   may   aid   proof:   a   breach   may
   be established by  the  "existence  of  sufficiently  strong,  clear  and
   concordant                        inferences  or  of  similar  unrebutted
   presumptions of fact": Jasar v.  Macedonia                    69908/1  15
   February 2007 � 48. Attainment  of  the  minimum  level  of  severity  to
     establish a breach of Article 3 may, however, be easier to establish in
   a contracting                state than in a non-contracting state: Babar
   Ahmad v. UK 24027/07 & Others 10                   April 2012 � 177:
                   "However in reaching this  conclusion,  the  court  would
      underline that it agrees with               Lord Browne's  observation
      in  Wellington  that  the  absolute   nature   of   Article   3   does
      not mean that any form of ill-treatment will act as a bar  to  removal
      from a               contracting state. As Lord Browne observed,  this
      court has repeatedly stated that            the  Convention  does  not
      purport  to  be  a  means  of   requiring   the   contracting   states
      to impose  Convention  standards  on  other  states...This  being  so,
      treatment which           might violate Article 3 because of an act or
      omission of a contracting state might           not attain the minimum
      level of severity which is  required  for  there  to  be  a  violation
      of Article 3 in an expulsion  or  extradition  case.  For  example,  a
      contracting  state's            negligence  in  providing  appropriate
      medical care within its jurisdiction has, on             occasion, led
      the court to find a violation of Article 3 but  such  violations  have
      not              been so readily established in the  extra-territorial
      context (compare the denial  of               prompt  and  appropriate
      medical    treatment     for     HIV/Aids     in     Aleksanyan     v.
      Russia...with N v. UK..."
                   In a "foreign" case, the burden of  proof  is  lower.  An
      applicant is required to               establish  substantial  grounds
      for believing that if removed to another state  he  faces            a
      real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. If he
      does so, the              removing state is prohibited from  deporting
      him there: Saadi v. Italy 37201/06              [2008] ECHR 179 � 125.
      However,
                   "Article 3 principally applies to prevent  a  deportation
      or expulsion where  the  risk  of               ill-treatment  in  the
      receiving  country  emanates  from  intentionally  inflicted  acts  of
      the public  authorities  there  or  from  non-state  bodies  when  the
      authorities are           unable to afford the  applicant  appropriate
      protection..."


              29. On the facts, the position under the Convention is no less
   clear. This is a "foreign"                case. If  the  "foreign"  tests
   established   by   Strasbourg    in    Articles    3    and    5    cases
   apply, the answer  is  straightforward.  Article  3  imposes  no  general
   obligation  on  a                   contracting  state  to  refrain  from
   removing   a    person    to    another    state    or    territory    in
   which he would be destitute. Even in a "domestic" case, "it  is  not  the
   function of                  Article 3 to prescribe a minimum standard of
   social support for those in need....that               is  a  matter  for
   the social legislation of each signatory state", per Lord Scott at  �  66
          in Limbuela v. SSHD [2006] 1AC 396. It  is  only  when  deliberate
   state action is                  taken,  by  prohibiting  a  person  from
   providing for his own sustenance by work and                then removing
   from him the  provision  of  accommodation  and  the  barest  necessities
     of life, that a breach of Article 3 will occur: per Lord Bingham at � 6
   and 7 and per                Lord Hope at �  56.  In  a  "foreign"  case,
   wholly exceptional circumstances such as               those obtaining in
   D  v.  UK  30240/96  15  October  1996   may   engage   Article   3   and
   prohibit removal by a contracting state. Otherwise, "the  fact  that  the
   applicant's                    circumstances,    including    his    life
   expectancy, would be significantly reduced if he                 were  to
   be removed from the contracting state is not sufficient in itself to give
   rise                to breach of Article 3": N v. UK � 42. The  situation
   of these claimants is plainly not                  exceptional. They  are
   all  fit,  young  single  men.  It  is   common   ground   that   Maltese
   law does not now prohibit them from working. They may  be  provided  with
              rudimentary accommodation and very modest  financial  support,
   but even if they                 were not, Article 3 would not be engaged
   - not even in Malta and certainly not in               the UK.


    65. Article 3 does not set out any minimum standards that an individual
        is entitled to enjoy  as  of  right.   We  do  not  find  that  the
        appellant has discharged the burden of proof upon him to show  that
        any hardship he may experience on  return  to  Angola  crosses  the
        threshold  necessary  to  engage  Article  3.   He  is  a   healthy
        resourceful individual who has been able to survive in the past and
        who has not proved his level of suffering or  destitution  will  be
        such that Article 3 will be engaged. It has not been shown he  will
        be unable to seek the assistance of the various  NGO's  in  Luanda,
        some of whom work in the  international  language  of  English,  or
        church groups to enable him to establish himself and meet his basis
        needs.


    66. As stated, we not accept Article 3 ECHR is engaged  or  capable  of
        proving an exception to the deportation decision and therefore  the
        appellant is dependent upon Article 8 based  predominantly  on  his
        private life in the United Kingdom and his settled status  in  this
        country. We accept those ties are deep and, as stated above, he  is
        a British citizen in all bar nationality. He is a product  of  this
        country with little or no experience of living in his  home  state.
        The family members he  has  here  are  part  of  his  private  life
        recognised by Article 8 as are his friends, associates, and  others
        with whom he is engaged in the United Kingdom, including  those  he
        has  met  in  prison.  The  question  before  us  is  whether   his
        deportation is proportionate in  all  the  circumstances  when  due
        weight is given to the appellants claims on the one hand, including
        the strength of his ties to  this  country  and  lack  of  ties  to
        Angola, and the legitimate aim relied  upon  by  the  Secretary  of
        State.


    67. In terms of the weight to be given to the respondent's case we have
        to take into account the  fact  the  appellant  is  subject  to  an
        automatic deportation order. The inclusion  of  the  exceptions  to
        automatic deportation is an issue noted by the Court of  Appeal  in
        SS (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 550 who,  notwithstanding  this  fact,
        gave guidance upon the weight to be attached to the fact that  once
        a relevant  conviction  occurs,  absent  an  ability  to  prove  an
        applicable  exception,  an  individual  must   be   removed.   That
        Parliament had passed legislation  to  this  effect  in  the  terms
        referred to by the Court is indicative of the weight that should be
        given to such a clear public policy statement when undertaking  the
        Article 8 balancing exercise.  SS  (Nigeria)  was  followed  in  CW
        (Jamaica) [2013] EWCA Civ 915 in which Lord Justice McCombe stated:


              34. In considering these provisions in the SS  (Nigeria)  case
   (supra), Laws LJ                 considered extensively the law  relating
   to the balance between Article 8                   rights and the  public
   interest   in   deporting   foreign   criminals,   the    latter    being
   forcibly emphasised by the statutory provisions which I have just quoted.
                  At paragraph [48] Laws LJ said this:
                   "....Where such potential deportees  have  raised  claims
      under Article 8,              seeking to resist deportation by relying
      on the  interests  of  a  child  or                   children  having
      British  citizenship,  I  think   with   respect   that   insufficient
      attention has been paid to the weight to be attached, in virtue of its
      origin           in primary legislation, to the  policy  of  deporting
      foreign criminals."
                   At paragraph 54, the learned Lord Justice added:
                   "I would  draw  particular  attention  to  the  provision
      contained in s.33(7):              "section 32(4) applies despite  the
      application of Exception 1...", that is  to           say,  a  foreign
      criminal's  deportation  remains  conducive   to   the   public   good
      notwithstanding his successful  reliance  on  Article  8.  I  said  at
      paragraph 46              that while the authorities demonstrate  that
      there is no rule of exceptionality              for  Article  8,  they
      also   clearly   show   that   the   more    pressing    the    public
      interest in removal or deportation, the stronger  must  be  the  claim
      under            Article 8 if it is to prevail. The pressing nature of
      the public interest here is            vividly informed  by  the  fact
      that  by  Parliament's  express  declaration  the               public
      interest is injured if the criminal's  deportation  is  not  effected.
      Such a           result could in my judgment only be  justified  by  a
      very strong claim                  indeed."


    68. The question therefore, when balancing the competing interests,  is
        whether the scales fall in favour of the appellant or the Secretary
        of State. Having very carefully considered all the elements of this
        appeal relied upon by the appellant, the detailed submissions  made
        on his behalf by Ms  Lagunju,  and  those  of  Mr  Norton  for  the
        Secretary of State, we do not find that  it  has  been  established
        that the case under Article 8 is  sufficiently  strong  to  prevail
        over the pressing public interest in the  appellant's  deportation.
        We find the Secretary of State has discharged the burden  of  proof
        upon her to the required standard to  prove  that  the  appellant's
        removal from the United  Kingdom  is  proportionate.   Borrowing  a
        phrase from the judgment in CW (Jamaica), the Article  8  claim  is
        far from  being  "very  strong".  It  is  impossible  to  see  how,
        therefore, those claims could outweigh the express  declaration  of
        the public interest in the deportation of a foreign criminal,  such
        as this appellant, as expressly stated in the statute.  The risk of
        serious potential harm to the public still remains and there  is  a
        very strong deterrent element in this appeal in  relation  to  non-
        nationals who choose to carry out acts of  violence  against  third
        parties which is an increasing problem in British  society,  as  is
        the gang culture in inner cities and elsewhere.


Decision

    69. The First-tier Tribunal Panel has been  found  to  have  materially
        erred in law and  its  decision  has  been  aside.  We  remake  the
        decision as follows. This appeal is dismissed.




   Anonymity.


    70. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.  We make no such order as none was applied for and  no  basis
        for making such an order emerges from the facts.
