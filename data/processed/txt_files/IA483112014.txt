                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction


1. I refer to the parties as they were in the First-tier Tribunal although
   it is the respondent who is appealing in these proceedings.

2. The appellant is a national of India, born on 18 December 1983. He came
   to the United Kingdom on 22 September 2008 on a student visa valid until
   31 March 2010. He then obtained further leaves as a student and post
   student until 28 August 2013. A further application as a student was
   refused on 19 November 2013. His appeal was listed for 30 May 2014 but
   did not proceed as the decision was withdrawn.

3. On 11 August 2014 he applied for leave to remain on the basis of his
   private and family life. That application was refused on 14 November
   2014.

4. His appeal against that refusal was heard by First-tier Judge Green at
   Birmingham on the 9th March 2015. At the hearing the appellant's
   representative accepted that the appellant could not succeed under the
   immigration rules but relied upon article 8 rights outside the rules. In
   a decision promulgated on 16 March 2015 the appeal was allowed on human
   rights grounds.

5. The respondent has been given permission to appeal the decision on the
   basis it is arguably incorrect in law. The emphasis in the appeal was on
   the appellant's relationship with Mrs Elliot, a British national. They
   met online in November 2012. The appellant was living in Hertfordshire
   and Mrs Elliot was residing in Essex. They would meet at weekends. As the
   relationship developed, Mrs Elliot obtained employment in Hertfordshire
   and cohabited from in or around mid-October 2014.

6. At paragraph 14 of the decision Judge Green set out the relevant facts
   found. The judge found the appellant and Mrs Elliot to be credible
   witnesses. In summary, the judge stated that since coming to the United
   Kingdom the appellant had graduated with a Masters degree in Business
   Administration. He believed there were better opportunities for him in
   the United Kingdom .He had been working at Asda and was well regarded. He
   had been offered a management training opportunity, subject to his
   immigration status. He contended he would be able to maintain himself and
   his partner without recourse to public funds. His parents and a brother
   and sister were still in India. They remained in contact though he did
   not enjoy a good relationship with his father.

7. Regarding Mrs Elliott, Judge Green found that she was a British citizen
   and that her whole life was based in the United Kingdom. She had obtained
   a decree nici in relation to her marriage of 37 years and was awaiting
   her divorce becoming absolute. She had two adult sons from that marriage
   and has a close bond with her three grandchildren living in Essex. She
   was working for Marks & Spencer's as a store assistant on a permanent
   basis earning ï¿½14,765 per year. She has a close relationship with her
   mother who five years ago was diagnosed with breast cancer. This
   subsequently spread to her lungs and kidneys and she is undergoing
   chemotherapy. Mrs Elliot supported and cared for her.

Permission to appeal

8. In seeking leave the respondent mounted four areas of challenge.
   Firstly, it was contended that Judge Green did not accurately assess the
   public interest consideration because of a misinterpretation of the
   meaning of `partner'.
9. Secondly, it was submitted the judge was wrong in concluding that the
   operative reason for the respondent's position was that the immigration
   rules must be obeyed. It was contended that the operative reason was
   effective immigration control which was in the public interest.

10. Thirdly, it was contended that when considering the possibility of the
   appellant reapplying for entry clearance there was misdirection as to the
   rationale of the Chickwamba and Hyatt decisions.

11. The fourth ground related to the decision of Nagre .There, the European
   jurisprudence was reviewed. It held that where family life is established
   when the immigration status of the claimant is precarious, removal will
   be disproportionate only in exceptional cases. In the present case it was
   submitted the judge's focus was on whether the separation of the
   appellant and Mrs Elliot could be reasonably avoided. It was contended
   the judge failed to consider that the interference with family life was
   proportionate to the public interest given  the immigration rules were
   not met and there were no exceptional circumstances leading to
   unjustifiably harsh consequences.

Proceedings in the Upper Tribunal

12. Mr Nace, Presenting Officer, continued to rely upon the four challenges
   made.

13. Mr Nasim submitted that the grounds were misconceived. He referred me
   to paragraph 13 of the decision, pointing out it was common case that the
   appellant had a genuine and subsisting relationship with Mrs Elliot. He
   referred to the findings made by the judge at paragraph 14, particularly
   at (iv) were the judge referred to the appellant having a close
   relationship with Mrs Elliott and that he supported her emotionally,
   physically and financially. He referred me to paragraph 15 of the
   decision were Mrs Elliott's family circumstances are set out. At
   paragraph 19(v) the judge considered the question of proportionality and
   the policy expressed in the immigration rules. The judge said the fact an
   applicant fails to qualify under the immigration rules is relevant but as
   a starting point rather than a conclusion and that the proportionality
   exercise cannot be reduced to whether the case is truly exceptional. At
   paragraph 19(vi) the judge referred to general considerations relating to
   the effective and consistent operation of immigration control that may
   weigh in favour of refusal when assessing proportionality. He pointed out
   that section 117B (5) states that little weight should be given to a
   private life established when the persons immigration status is
   precarious and does not refer to family life. Regarding the possibility
   of applying for re-entry from India he submitted the judge set out the
   relevant considerations.

14. I indicated I would be reserving my decision and both parties agreed
   that if I found a material error of law. I could remake the decision
   without the need for further evidence.

Consideration

15.   At paragraph 26(i) Judge Green stated:

         He established his relationship with Ms Elliot, (who is a British
         citizen) and, therefore, a qualifying partner for the purposes of
         the 2002 Act at a time when he was in the United Kingdom lawfully
         and his immigration status at that time was not precarious. Given
         the fact that he application was made 6 days after his leave
         expired but within 28 days of expiry it is questionable whether his
         immigration state became precarious as he was in the UK without
         limited leave to enter or remain.


   There are two issues arising here, namely, whether the judge was  correct
   in concluding Mrs Elliott was a qualifying partner, and secondly, whether
   his immigration status was precarious when the relationship developed. My
   conclusion is the judge was incorrect on both grounds.

16. The 2002 Act at section 117 D defines a qualifying partner as a partner
   who is a British citizen. There is no dispute that Mrs Elliott is a
   British citizen. However the respondent contends that `partner' has to be
   understood in the same way as a `partner' is defined in Appendix FM,GEN
   1.1: a spouse or someone they have been living with in a relationship
   akin to marriage for at least two years before the date of application. I
   believe this is correct. This would be consistent with the traditional
   distinction between a spouse and a partner. In the case of the latter two
   years cohabitation has traditionally been taken as a comparator in order
   to demonstrate durability in a relationship.

17.  Judge Green was clearly wrong in concluding his immigration status was
   not precarious. In AM (S 117B) Malawi [2015]UKUT 290 , the tribunal noted
   the distinction made between times when a person has been in the United
   Kingdom unlawfully and times when their immigration status has been
   precarious. The decision points out that in order to be considered
   precarious person must have held a grant of leave to enter or remain.
   Their precarious immigration status continued if they were dependent upon
   obtaining a further grant of leave. This is precisely the appellant's
   situation. When he came to the United Kingdom it was with leave for a
   fixed period. His initial leave expired on 31 March 2010; he obtained
   further leave until 30 October 2010 and then further leave until 23
   August 2013. He began a relationship with Mrs Elliott in November 2012.
   At that stage he had no guarantee he will be permitted to remain.

18. I note that section 117 B (4) is concerned with the situation of a
   person in the United Kingdom unlawfully. Judge Green at paragraph 26(i)
   recorded that the appellant had been in the United Kingdom lawfully save
   for a gap of 6 days after his leave expired and submitting any
   application. I acknowledge that for the bulk of the appellant's time he
   has been here lawfully though his immigration status was precarious
   because of its temporary nature.

19. I also acknowledge that section117 (B)(5) in providing little weight
   should be given where the persons status is precarious only applies in
   respect of private life. At paragraph 26(iii) Judge Green had referred to
   the appellant's significant private life. It is worth noting that in AM
   (S 117B) Malawi the Upper Tribunal at paragraph 14 pointed out that
   section 117 B did not grant any form of immigration status on an
   individual who does not meet the immigration rules on the basis of having
   a good command of English or being financially independent.

20. I also find that the approach taken to `the Chikwamba principal 'as
   refined in Hyatt is flawed. In carrying out the proportionality
   assessment at paragraph 28 the judge considered as an alternative to Mrs
   Elliott going to India, that the appellant returned to India and reapply
   for entry. The appellant's Counsel submitted there would be considerable
   uncertainties. This is completely different from the factual situation in
   Chikwamba. In Hayat (nature of Chikwamba principle) Pakistan [2011] UKUT
   444 (IAC) it was held that the significance of Chikwamba v SSHD [2008]
   UKHL 40 was that in appeals where the only matter weighing on the
   respondent's side of an Article 8 proportionality balance is the public
   policy of requiring an application to be made under the Immigration Rules
   from abroad, that the legitimate objective will usually be outweighed by
   factors resting on the appellant's side of the balance.  This is not the
   situation here and to expect the appellant to return to India and reapply
   for entry clearance is not being obtuse.

21. In conclusion, I find that there are a number of material errors of law
   in the decision and that it can no longer stand. The decision has been
   premised on a misunderstanding of what is meant by a partner within the
   meaning of section 117 B (4). The judge should have viewed the
   appellant's claim in the context that his immigration status was
   precarious. The judge also misdirected himself in his understanding of
   the Chikwamba principle.

Remaking the decision

22. It has been accepted that the appellant cannot meet the immigration
   rules. He relies upon a freestanding article 8 claim. It was accepted in
   the First-tier Tribunal that he has established a significant private
   life from his time here. He studied and worked here, as well as forming
   various social ties. However, I am obliged to have regard to the
   considerations in section 117 B, which includes at (4) that little weight
   should be given to a private life were a persons immigration status is
   precarious. The appellant's immigration status was precarious because he
   was dependent upon obtaining further leaves. Consequently, I would attach
   little weight to his private life. It is not disputed that he is in
   relationship with Mrs Elliott. The relationship is at a comparatively
   early stage. They first met in late 2012 and have been cohabiting since
   October 2014. They have always known the appellant was here on a
   temporary basis. It is my conclusion that the respondent's decision is
   proportionate.

Decision

23. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve
   errors of law. I set aside that decision.

24. I remake the decision. The appeal is dismissed under the immigration
   rules and there is no breach of article 8.

Anonymity

25. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order for anonymity. No
   application for such an order has been made before me. I see no reason of
   substance for making one
