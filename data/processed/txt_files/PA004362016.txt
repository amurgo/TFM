                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Ms N Loughran, of Loughran & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier Tribunal Judge A
    M S Green, promulgated on 20 June 2017, dismissing his  appeal  against
    refusal of asylum.

 2. The grounds are rather lengthy,  making  the  same  point  in  slightly
    different ways.  Their essential thrust  is  that  the  judge  gave  no
    adequate reasons for his adverse findings, and in  particular  for  not
    accepting at �18 that the appellant did not have a CSID (on  which  the
    judge misunderstood the evidence) and that his family would not be able
    to help him obtain another one, essential issues in light  of  the  "AA
    Iraq" guidance as given by the UT and modified by the Court of Appeal.

 3. Ms Loughran did  not  expand  upon  �6  of  the  grounds,  "erroneously
    requiring corroboration".  �11 of the decision does not  bear  out  any
    such misconception.

 4. The grounds at �7 of the grounds say that the judge erred by  taking  a
    "section 8" credibility issue as a starting point  and  by  overlooking
    the appellant's explanation for not claiming en route, but Mr  Matthews
    was able to answer those issues by reference to �12  of  the  decision,
    where s.8 is not taken as a discrete point and where his explanation is
    explicitly rejected.

 5. In course of her submissions and in her reply, Ms  Loughran  said  that
    the country guidance now constitutes an exception to the  general  rule
    that separate reasons are  not  required  for  each  separate  negative
    finding.  She said that the issue of possession or ability to obtain  a
    CSID has been identified as of such crucial significance as to  require
    separate and specific reasoning,  and  could  not  be  covered  by  the
    reasons for a generally negative finding, even if those were  otherwise
    legally adequate.

 6. In my opinion,  the  degree  of  specific  reasoning  required  can  be
    assessed only on the facts of the case.  The  precise  realities  about
    the existence or availability of a  CSID  will  seldom  be  within  the
    capacity of a tribunal to resolve, and it is not its function to do so.
      There  will  be  cases  where  there  is  particular  evidence  about
    possession of or ability to  obtain  a  CSID  which  requires  separate
    reasoning.  There will also be cases where the  appellant's  claims  on
    those matters stand or fall with his general credibility.

 7. An appellant has simply to show  that  what  he  claims  is  reasonably
    likely; if he does not, there is no obligation on the respondent or  on
    a tribunal to demonstrate that his claims are beyond all possibility.

 8. The guidance requires clear findings, subject to the  usual  principles
    of legal adequacy of reasoning and no more.

 9. The amended country guidance in AA says at �9  that  "...  it  will  be
    necessary to decide whether P has a CSID, or will be able to obtain one
    ...".   Judge  Green  said  at  �18,  "Given  my  concerns  about   the
    appellant's general credibility, I do not accept that he does not  have
    a CSID or that his family will not be able to help him  obtain  another
    one ...".   No  error  has  been  shown  in  his  findings  on  general
    credibility.  There is no discrete  error  in  relation  to  the  CSID.



10. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

11. The FtT made an anonymity direction, but not at the request  of  either
    party, and for no stated reason.   Representatives  agreed  that  there
    was no need for anonymity, so that order is discharged.
