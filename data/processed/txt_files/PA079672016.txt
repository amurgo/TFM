Representation
For the appellant:     Mr I Palmer of Counsel
For the respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a citizen of Iran, born on [ ]  1996,  appealed  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal against the decision of  the  respondent  dated  18
    July 2016 to refuse his claim for asylum and humanitarian protection in
    the United  Kingdom.  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Khan  dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal on July 2016.


 2. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Ransley
    who founded arguable that the Judge failed to engage with or  make  any
    findings on the evidence in the country  expert  report  of  Prof  Emil
    Joffe regarding the enhanced risk on return due to the appellant  being
    a Kurd and a failed asylum seeker who had  exited  Iran  illegally.  He
    also said that the Judge failed to engage with the submissions made  on
    behalf of the appellant that there are good reasons to depart from  the
    CG case of SSH and HR Iran CG [2016] UKUT 308  (IAC).  The  Judge  also
    failed to engage with Prof Joffe's evidence  on  the  very  significant
    discrimination against Kurds in Iran and the discrimination amounts  to
    a very significant obstacle to integration into Iran. This  might  have
    made a material difference to the outcome of the appeal.


 3. Thus, the appeal came before me.


The First-tier Tribunal Judge's findings


 4.  The  Judge  made  the  following  findings  which  I  summarise.   The
    appellant's background is that he ran a grocery shop in  Iran,  selling
    cigarettes and alcohol to  a  few  customers.  On  the  evening  of  24
    December 2015, a friend asked him to keep a parcel in  his  shop  until
    the next day which he agreed  to  do.  The  following  day  his  mother
    informed the appellant  that  his  neighbour  had  told  her  that  the
    appellant should close the  shop  and  go  into  hiding  as  there  was
    something illegal in his shop. The appellant gave  the  parcel  to  his
    mother who later told him that she had burnt  it.  He  also  moved  the
    alcohol from the shop elsewhere. His  mother  told  him  to  leave  the
    village and go to his uncle in Sardesht. He arranged an agent to  leave
    Iran. His mother informed his uncle that  the  authorities  raided  his
    shop and the family home on 25  December  2015  taking  his  belongings
    including his identity card and his birth  certificate.  The  appellant
    cannot return to  Iran  because  he  will  be  mistreated  due  to  him
    accepting an illegal parcel.


 5. The appellant claims that he started his Facebook  postings  since  his
    arrival in the United Kingdom although he could not remember the  date.
    He had no evidence of these Facebook postings and has not printed  them
    off from the computer. Even if the appellant has something on Facebook,
    how will the Iranian authorities come to know of it.

 6. In his screening interview, the appellant claimed  that  he  left  Iran
    because he had been accused  of  helping  the  Pejak  party  and  would
    distribute their leaflets in his shop. He stated that  the  authorities
    came to arrest him and he  decided  to  leave  Iran.  However,  in  his
    witness statement the appellant's evidence completely  changed  and  he
    stated that one of his regular customers came with two other friends to
    his shop and asked him to keep a small parcel at his shop.  There  were
    other inconsistencies in the evidence pointed out  by  the  Judge  from
    paragraph 33 to 37 and found him not to be credible and  dismissed  his
    appeal.








Grounds of appeal


 7. The grounds of appeal argued that the appellant is an Iranian  national
    of Kurdish ethnicity who first entered the United Kingdom on 2 February
    2016 at his asylum claim was refused by the respondent on 18 July 2016.
    The respondent accepted  the  appellant's  nationality,  ethnicity  and
    identity but not his account of past experiences or that he would be at
    risk if returned to Iran.


 8. The Judge failed to deal with the submissions made  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant that there were four grounds upon which it was said that  the
    appellant would be at risk upon his  return  to  Iran.  These  are  his
    activities in Iran, his Kurdish ethnicity, his illegal exit  from  Iran
    and his return to Iran as a failed asylum seeker.


 9. The core of the submissions made on  this  aspect  of  the  appellant's
    claim was that the Judge should depart from the country  guidance  case
    of SSH and HR. The Judge failed to engage with any of the arguments put
    before him including that the expert in his report  submitted  that  in
    the appellant's case he had vigorously  challenged  with  the  reasoned
    argument and evidence that the conclusions that the Tribunal reached in
    SSH and HR in respect of the four findings that were  material  to  the
    appellant's case.


10. Prof Joffe in his report pointed out that  undocumented  returnees  can
    obtain a laissez pass� upon the production of  proof  of  identity  and
    proof of nationality to an Iranian Embassy second that absent any other
    adverse inference a person who left Iran illegally or who was a  failed
    asylum seeker would not be at risk for those reasons alone, third  that
    as a returnee who is Kurdish would not enhance their risk  per  se  and
    thought that Kurdish, in general do not face a disproportionate risk of
    official discrimination and  persecution.  The  Judge  was  invited  to
    depart from the conclusions of the Upper Tribunal  in  SSH  and  HR  in
    respect of those findings on the basis of the expert report provided by
    Prof Joffe and expert whose bona fides are well established.


11. The expert further noted that the situation in Iran  has  worsened  for
    every Kurdish returnee who has given rise to suspicions of  anti-regime
    behaviour, either at home or whilst abroad such as claiming asylum  and
    therefore his  prospects  of  avoiding  persecution  are  significantly
    diminished. Furthermore, the expert noted  that  applications  from  an
    asylum seeker for a laissez pass� cannot be  made  without  potentially
    endangering the applicant. It was incumbent on the Judge to engage with
    these issues.


The respondent's Rule 24 response


12. The respondent in her rule 24  respondent  stated  the  following.  The
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal directed himself appropriately. On the
    face of the decision without sight of the skeleton  argument  submitted
    on behalf of the appellant, there appears to have been no argument  put
    forward at the hearing that a request  was  made  to  depart  from  the
    country guidance case. Even if that was the  case,  one  expert  report
    with no supporting objective evidence would be insufficient to lead  to
    departure from the country guidance case law if these findings were not
    demonstrated as happening on the ground.


Findings  as  to  whether  there  is  a  material  error  of  law   in   the
determination.


13. Essentially, the point been taken by counsel on behalf of the appellant
    is that the First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in  law  by  not
    taking into account the expert report and departing  from  the  country
    guidance case of SSH and HR. The appellant also  took  issue  that  the
    Judge did not consider that the appellant was a Kurd and this would put
    him at risk on return as opined by the expert, Prof Joffe.


14. It was clear from the decision of  the  First-tier  tier  Tribunal  who
    dismissed the appellant's appeal, did not find the  appellant  credible
    in respect of events which the appellant claims to have taken  pace  in
    Iran and no issue is taken with those findings. The Judge  gave  proper
    cogent reasons for finding that the appellant left Iran as an  economic
    migrant. These findings are without arguable error.


15. The Judge in his decision after finding  that  the  appellant  was  not
    credible did not engage with the appellant's  evidence  that  he  is  a
    Kurdish failed asylum seeker. After  having  found  the  appellant  not
    credible about events that the appellant claimed happened to him before
    he left Iran, he did not engage in any  of  the  other  issues  in  the
    appeal.


16. There is therefore merit in the argument that the Judge did not  engage
    with the expert evidence of Prof Joffe about risk on return. The  Judge
    also failed to consider that the appellant will be returned to Iran  as
    an unwilling returnee who has claimed asylum  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    However, I note that the appellant has only been away from  Iran  since
    early 2016 and this is a  factor  to  be  considered  when  determining
    whether the appellant will be questioned on his return  which  is  when
    the problems for a returnee normally start.


17. The Judge recorded the appellant's evidence at paragraph 36 and  stated
    that the appellant states that since his arrival in the United  Kingdom
    in February 2016, he has been posting  materials  against  the  Iranian
    authorities on his Facebook page. The Judge stated that  the  appellant
    has not had a single response to it and has not provided  any  evidence
    of the posts such as printouts. Therefore, there was no evidence before
    the Judge about  the  appellant's  Internet  activity.  The  Judge  was
    therefore entitled to find that the appellant had not demonstrated  his
    Internet activity in the United Kingdom.


18. The Judge therefore cannot be criticised for  not  considering  whether
    the appellant claimed Internet activities would put him at risk on  his
    return to Iran because there was no evidence of  this  activity  before
    him. At the hearing, there was no attempt to refer me two the  evidence
    of the Facebook activities of the appellant, which was before the Judge
    which it is claimed that the Judge did not consider.


19. The Judge also stated that even if he was to accept that the  appellant
    may have put something on his Facebook  account,  he  questioned,  "how
    would anyone be able to access his account in Iran". This finding  does
    not rest easily with the case of AB and  others  (Internet  activity  -
    state of evidence) Iran [2015] 0257 (IAC)  where  it  was  stated  that
    there is clear evidence that some people are asked about their Internet
    activity and particularly for their Facebook password. It is absolutely
    clear that blogging and activities on Facebook are very common  amongst
    Iranian citizens and it is very clear that the Iranian authorities  are
    exceedingly twitchy about them. The act of returning someone creates "a
    pinch point" so that returnees are brought into direct contact with the
    authorities  in  Iran  who  have  both  the  time  and  inclination  to
    interrogate them. background evidence that Iranian authorities  do  ask
    for returnees Facebook password to look into their account.


20. The Judge did not even refer to the country guidance case  of  SSH  and
    HR, in his decision much less say that he had been  invited  to  depart
    from it. The Judge obviously did not consider that it was not an  issue
    in this appeal because he did not accept the appellant's evidence  that
    he had participated in any Internet activities in  the  United  Kingdom
    which would put him at risk on return.


21. However, the evidence before the Judge was that the  appellant  was  an
    unwilling Kurdish returnee and should have  addressed  how  this  would
    affect the appellant's safe return to Iran. His failure to engage  with
    these issues brought him into material error.


22. I find that there is a material error of law in  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal for not considering the country  guidance  case  of
    SSH and HR. The issue remains whether the appellant would be at risk on
    his return to Iran as a  failed  Kurdish  asylum  seeker  who  will  be
    perceived by the Iranian authorities to have anti-regime  proclivities,
    remains to be considered.


23. I however preserve the adverse credibility findings  made  against  the
    appellant by the Judge about the events which the appellant  claims  to
    have happened in Iran.


24. I direct that the appeal  be  placed  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  for
    submissions on the issue of risk on return for this appellant,  on  the
    evidence in this appeal, including the expert report of Dr Joffe.

Resumed hearing on 9 February 2018

  25. I heard submissions from both parties as to the  appellant's  risk  of
      return to Iran. The issue I now must decide is whether  the  appellant
      faces any risk on return to Iran as an unwilling Turkish Kurd returnee
      who left Iran illegally and who  has  claimed  asylum  in  the  United
      Kingdom.

  26. It has been argued that I should depart from the country guidance case
      of SSH and HR and rely on the expert's evidence. It is argued that  Dr
      Joffe's report is an extension to the country guidance case on Iran.


  27. I have considered the country guidance case  of  SSH  and  HR  and  Dr
      Joffe's report as  to  the  risks  to  the  appellant  on  his  return
      considering the appellant's profile.  I  am  aware  that  the  country
      guidance case is the authoritative guidance  on  the  situation  in  a
      particular country based on assessment of expert and factual evidence.
      I also am aware that I must take into account of an applicable country
      guidance case in deciding whether the appellant's fear of  persecution
      is well-founded. A failure to do so is an  error  of  law  because  it
      constitutes a failure to take a material matter into account.



  28. I take into account the case of DSG & Others (Afghan Sikhs:  departure
      from CG) Afghanistan [2013] UKUT 00148 (IAC) where it was said that as
      this case shows, country guidance cases are not set in stone (see also
      HS (Burma) [2013] EWCA Civ 67), and a judge may depart  from  existing
      country guidance  in  the  circumstances  described  in  the  Practice
      Direction and the Chamber Guidance Note.  I note that it is necessary,
      in the wording of the Practice Direction to show why it does not apply
      to the case in question.  In SG (Iraq) [2012] EWCA Civ 940, the  Court
      of Appeal made it clear, at paragraph 47,  that  decision  makers  and
      Tribunal Judges aare required to take country guidance  determinations
      into account, and to follow them unless very strong grounds  supported
      by cogent evidence, are adduced, justifying their not doing so.  To do
      otherwise will amount to an error of law.



  29. In the Upper Tribunal Immigration and  Asylum  Chamber  Guidance  Note
      2011 No 2, at paragraph 11, it is stated:






         " If there is credible fresh evidence relevant to  the  issue  that
         has not been considered in the  country  guidance  case  or,  if  a
         subsequent  case  includes  further  issues  that  have  not   been
         considered in the CG case, the judge  will  reach  the  appropriate
         conclusion on the evidence, taking into account the  conclusion  in
         the CG case so far as it remains relevant."





  30. I take into account Dr Joffe's expert report in this regard  and  note
      that he is an expert  of  repute.  Dr  Joffe  challenged  the  country
      guidance case  with  reasoned  argument  and  evidence  and  that  the
      conclusion the tribunal  reached  in  the  country  guidance  case  in
      respect of four findings that were material to the  appellant's  case.
      These findings were, first,  that  in  an  documented  individual  can
      obtain unless it pass� upon production of proof of identity and  proof
      of nationality to an Iranian Embassy, second  that  absent  any  other
      adverse inference a person who left Iran illegally or who was a failed
      asylum seeker would not be at risk for those reasons alone, third that
      a returnee who is Kurdish would not enhance  their  risk  per  se  and
      fourth that Kurds, in general do not face a disproportionate  risk  of
      official discrimination and persecution.



  31. Dr Joffe referenced in his report of October 15, 2014 where he pointed
      out that undocumented returnees issued with travel  documents  to  the
      Iranian authorities will appear before a special court on return  when
      they can face prison and ill-treatment. His recent evidence  was  that
      Kurds returned to Iran to face an increased risk of persecution simply
      because of their Kurdish ethnicity and therefore  the  combination  of
      being both Kurdish and  a  failed  asylum  seeker  does  result  in  a
      significant risk of persecution. It was also Dr Joffe's evidence  that
      the situation in Iran has worsened and if a Kurdish returnee has given
      rise to a suspicion of anti-regime behaviour either at home or  whilst
      abroad such as claiming asylum, his prospects of avoiding  persecution
      are significantly diminished. He also stated that applicants  from  an
      asylum seeker for a lasse pass� cannot  be  made  without  potentially
      endangering the applicant.



  32.  I  consider  Dr  Joffe's  report  is  supplementary  evidence   which
      undermines the conclusion reached in  the  country  guidance  decision
      that a Kurd will not necessarily be at risk on his return to  Iran.  I
      therefore find that there are  reasons  for  me  to  depart  from  the
      country guidance  case  and  accept  the  evidence  of  Dr  Joffe  who
      considers that the appellant would be  at  risk  as  a  failed  asylum
      seeker who left the country unlawfully.



  33. I find that Dr  Joffe's  evidence  justifies  my  departure  from  the
      country guidance in SSH and HR. I find that the appellant would be  at
      risk on his return to Iran.



Decision



  34. I allow the appellant's appeal under the Refugee Convention  and  this
      concludes the matter.
