For the Respondent:    Miss A Brocklesby-Weller, Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant was born on 20 January 1982 in Kosovo.  On 21  July  2011
    he married his British wife in Kosovo. She was originally from  Kosovo.
    He entered the United Kingdom a number of  times  to  visit  her  after
    their marriage and she also visited him in Kosovo. Sometimes  she  took
    their son with her.  The Appellant last entered the United  Kingdom  on
    28 October 2014, as a visitor.  On 22  December  2014  he  applied  for
    leave to remain here  as  his  wife's  spouse.   This  application  was
    refused on 19 February 2015 and he appealed on 25 February 2015.
2.   On 26 August 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Row dismissed  the  appeal.
    It was not argued at that appeal that the Appellant could succeed under
    the  Immigration  Rules.   The  Appellant  did  argue  that  he  had  a
    derivative right of residence but this ground of appeal  is  no  longer
    relied upon.
3.   The Appellant appealed on 4  September  2015  and  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Hollingworth granted him permission on 29 December  2015  on  the
    basis that First-tier Tribunal Judge Row  should  have  considered  the
    Appellant's circumstances at  the  date  of  the  appeal  hearing  when
    considering whether his  Article  8  rights  had  been  breached.   The
    Respondent made a Rule 24 response on 18 January 2016.

ERROR OF LAW HEARING

4.   Counsel for the Appellant  submitted  that  First-tier  Judge  Row  had
    erred in law when he found  that  the  Appellant  could  not  meet  the
    financial requirements contained in the Immigration Rules at  the  time
    of his application when he was considering the Appellant's rights under
    Article 8 of the ECHR. He also referred to the table of the Appellant's
    wife's current earnings, which was at page 4 of his skeleton  argument,
    and submitted that in the year up to 31 July  2015  she  had  earned  a
    gross amount of �21,354.19. He also relied on the  cases  of  LS  (post
    decision evidence; direction; appealability) Gambia [2005] UKAIT  00085
    and SO (Nigera) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2007]
    EWCA Civ 76. In addition, he  submitted  that  First-tier  Judge  Row's
    approach to the Appellant's English language skills was incorrect.
5.   Counsel for the  Appellant  also  submitted  that  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Row did not apply the law relating to the Appellant's son's  best
    interests correctly in paragraphs 22 to 25  of  his  decision.  Counsel
    said that he failed to properly assess  the  impact  on  the  child  of
    separation from the Appellant when they currently  lived  together  and
    the Appellant cared for him. He also relied  on  the  case  of  JO  and
    Others (section 55 duty) Nigeria [2014] UKUT 00517 (IAC).
6.   The Home Office Presenting Officer then responded. She noted  that  the
    Appellant could not meet the requirements of the Immigration  Rules  as
    he was here as a visitor and that, therefore, he needed  to  show  that
    there were compelling circumstances in his case which entitled  him  to
    leave to remain outside the Rules. She also submitted that there was no
    reason why the Appellant could not return to Kosovo and apply for entry
    clearance there and that he could not just refuse to return to  do  so.
    She also noted that the First-tier Judge had found in paragraph  25  of
    his decision that he did "not find that the welfare of the child  would
    be adversely affected in any significant  way  by  the  return  of  the
    appellant to Kosovo".
7.   First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth  had  not  given  the  Appellant
    permission to argue that First-tier Tribunal Judge Row  had  not  taken
    into account the case of Chikwamba v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
    Department [2008] UKHL 40.  However,  as  the  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer had raised the issue of return in  order  to  apply  for  entry
    clearance  in  her  oral  submissions,  I  permitted  counsel  for  the
    Appellant to respond and rely on the section of his  skeleton  argument
    which related  to  Chikwamba  and  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department v Hayat (Pakistan) [2012] EWCA Civ 1054. He  also  submitted
    that, if the Appellant did return to Kosovo, he would  succeed  in  any
    application for entry clearance as his wife's spouse.

ERROR OF LAW DECISION

8.   When formulating his decision First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Row  did  not
    refer to the Immigration Rules or consider relevant case law such as  R
    (on the application of  Nagre)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department  [2013]  EWHC  720  and  consider  whether  there  were  any
    exceptional circumstances which entitled  the  Appellant  to  leave  to
    remain  outside  the  Immigration  Rules.  Instead,   he   started   by
    considering whether Article 8  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human
    Rights would be breached if the Appellant was removed from  the  United
    Kingdom.
9.    When  doing  so  he  considered  whether  his  removal  would   be   a
    disproportionate breach of Article  8.  As  this  was  a  human  rights
    appeal, as opposed to an appeal under the Immigration Rules, First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Row was entitled to take into account  any  matter  that
    was relevant to the substance of the decision at the date of the appeal
    hearing. This approach was  confirmed  in  the  cases  of  LS  and  SO.
    Therefore, in paragraph 29 of his decision  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Row erred in  law  when  he  failed  to  take  into  account  that  the
    Appellant's wife now earned more than �18,600 a year and looked back at
    the situation at the date of the decision under the Immigration  Rules.
    He also erred when he failed to take into account  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant had obtained a certificate from the University  of  Cambridge
    which confirmed that he had passed a Key English  Test  at  Council  of
    Europe Level A2. Instead First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Row  ignored  this
    qualification and relied  on  the  fact  that  the  Appellant  used  an
    interpreter at the appeal hearing.
10.  In paragraph 35 of his decision  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Row  also
    found  that  in  the  context  of  section  117B  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 "it is  in  the  public  interest  that
    persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are  able  to
    speak English [and]  the  appellant  gave  evidence  today  through  an
    interpreter". However, First-tier Tribunal Judge  Row  failed  to  take
    into account the University of Cambridge  certificate  which  indicated
    that the Appellant was able to speak English to some  extent  and  this
    was a factor which should have been taken into  account  when  applying
    section 117B.
11.   When  granting  permission  to  appeal   First-tier   Tribunal   Judge
    Holllingworth found that it was arguable that First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Row applied the wrong test in paragraph 25  of  his  decision  when  he
    found that "the welfare of the child would be adversely affected in any
    significant way by the return of the appellant to Kosovo". In paragraph
    22 of his decision First-tier Tribunal Judge Row did remind himself the
    welfare of the Appellant's son should be a primary consideration and in
    paragraph 22 he noted that he was two years old, was  in  good  health,
    was not at school and was primarily looked after by his mother.
12.  He also took into account the fact that he was a  British  citizen  but
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Row did not remind himself that in  paragraph
    30 of ZH (Tanzania) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011]
    UKSC 4 Lady Hale held that "although nationality is not a "trump  card"
    it is of particular importance in assessing the best interests  of  any
    child. The UNCRC recognises the right of every child to  be  registered
    and acquire a nationality and to preserve her identity,  including  her
    nationality".
13.  In JO and others the Upper Tribunal found that  "the  duty  imposed  by
    section 55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009
    requires the decision-maker to be properly informed of the position  of
    a child affected by the discharge  of  an  immigration  function.  Thus
    equipped, the decision maker must conduct a careful examination of  all
    relevant information and factors". I find that the value which attaches
    to British nationality was one such factor  which  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Row failed to take into account.
14.  Counsel for the Appellant also relied on  the  case  of  Chikwamba  and
    argued that this case confirmed that it was "only comparatively rarely,
    certainly in family cases  involving  children,  should  an  article  8
    appeal be dismissed on the basis that it  would  be  proportionate  and
    more appropriate for the appellant to apply for leave from  abroad.  He
    also relied on Hayat where it was held that "where Article 8 is engaged
    and there is no sensible reason for enforcing the policy, the  decision
    maker should determine the Article 8 claim on its  substantive  merits,
    having  regard  to  all  material  factors,  notwithstanding  that  the
    applicant has no lawful entry clearance".
15.  However, in R (on the application of Chen) v  Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department (Appendix FM - Chikwamba - temporary  separation  -
    proportionality) (IJR) [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal found
    that "Appendix FM  does  not  include  consideration  of  the  question
    whether it would be disproportionate to expect an individual to  return
    to his home country to make an entry clearance application  to  re-join
    family members in the UK. There may be cases  in  which  there  are  no
    insurmountable obstacles to family life being enjoyed  outside  the  UK
    but where temporary separation to  enable  an  individual  to  make  an
    application for entry clearance may be disproportionate. In all  cases,
    it will be for the individual to place before the  Secretary  of  State
    evidence   that    such    temporary    separation    will    interfere
    disproportionately with protected rights.  It will  not  be  enough  to
    rely solely upon the case law concerning Chikwamba".
16.  I find that Chen is  particularly  relevant  in  the  Appellant's  case
    because he had been coming in and out of the United Kingdom  since  the
    date of his marriage in 2011 and since the birth of his child  in  2013
    and there was nothing  in  the  evidence  to  suggest  that  a  further
    temporary separation would interfere disproportionately with  protected
    rights and there was no evidence about how long it would  take  him  to
    apply for entry clearance. Therefore, I find First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Row did not make any error of law when he found in paragraph 34 of  his
    decision that "there is no reason why the Appellant could not  go  back
    to Kosovo and make his application for  entry  as  the  spouse  of  the
    sponsor".
17.  However, I do find for the other reasons given  above  that  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Row did make material errors of law when dismissing  the
    Appellant's appeal.

Notice of Decision

1.   The Appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed  on  the  basis
    that First-tier Tribunal Judge Row failed  to  take  into  account  the
    Appellant's circumstances at the date of the appeal  hearing  and  also
    failed to apply relevant law relating to  the  Appellant's  son's  best
    interests.
2.   The Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's  decision  is  remitted
    to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard  de  novo  before  a  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Row.
