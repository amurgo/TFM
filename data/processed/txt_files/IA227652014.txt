                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This matter comes before me as an error of law hearing.  The  appellant
    appeals  a  decision   made   by   the   First-tier   Tribunal   (Judge
    Telford)("FtT") promulgated on 29 July 2015 in which the FtT  dismissed
    the appeal on immigration grounds under the Immigration EEA Regulations
    2006 ("EEA Regs") and on human rights grounds.



Background

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria.  He made an  application  on  14
    March 2014 for a residence card as confirmation of his right to  reside
    in the UK as a family member under Regulation 15(b) of  the  EEA  Regs.
    He was married to an EEA National on 24.11.2004.

3.   The FtT heard the appeal and found that there was no reliable  evidence
    to show that the appellant's wife was living and working in the UK  for
    the requisite five year period; the  documentary  evidence  as  regards
    employment between 2005 and 2007 was not satisfactory.  The FtT was not
    satisfied that she was a qualified person under Regulation  6(b).   The
    FtT found that the EEA national lived in Germany for a period  of  time
    which broke the continuity of residence (Reg 15(2) EEA Regs).

4.   In its decision and  reasons  the  FtT  [13]  recorded  an  alternative
    submission by the appellant's representative that he was entitled to  a
    residence card. The FtT considered family life at [14 - 16].

Appellant's application for Permission to Appeal

Ground 1

5.   The FtT failed to properly  apply  Regulation  15  of  the  Immigration
    (EEA) Regulations 2006, a right to permanent residence. The FtT made  a
    material error of  law  by  miscalculating  the  five  year  period  of
    residence as from 2005 until March 2011.  The correct  period  of  time
    was from the date of marriage on 24 November 2004 to March 2011.  There
    was no break in the continuity (Regulation 15(2)).

Ground 2

6.   The FtT failed to properly consider  evidence  to  show  that  the  EEA
    national was a qualified person.  The  FtT  erred  in  finding  that  a
    letter from HMRC which confirmed national insurance  payments  for  the
    tax years 2004-2005 and 2005-2006  was  not  evidence  of  actual  work
    completed on the part of the EEA national.  It further erred in finding
    that an unpaid tax demand for ï¿½411 was also not evidence of actual work
    done by the EEA national.

7.   The weight of the appellant's evidence  (including  the  oral  evidence
    from the appellant and his wife) together with 140 pages of documentary
    evidence ought  to  have  been  assessed  in  the  appellant's  favour.
    Specifically the FtT failed to take into account the unchallenged  oral
    evidence that their original documentation for the period 2004 to  2008
    remained with the Home Office.   The  evidence  was  sent  pursuant  to
    applications made by the appellant for three residence cards which were
    granted.

Ground 3

8.   The FtT failed to properly consider Regulation 14 and 17  EEA  Regs  in
    the alternative. The appellant was entitled to the grant of a five year
    residence card on the basis that he was  a  family  member  of  an  EEA
    national in the  UK  exercising  treaty  rights  as  a  self-sufficient
    person.  The findings made by the FtT at paragraph 13 were unclear  and
    unsupported by adequate reasoning.

Permission to appeal

9.   Permission was granted by Designated Judge of the FtT Appleyard on  all
    grounds.

Rule 24 Response

10.  In a letter dated 14 December 2015 the Secretary of State  opposed  the
    appeal.  The FtT was entirely correct that  the  five  year  period  of
    continuous residence had not been established [10-12], and gave reasons
    why the appellant had not discharged the burden of proof.

11.  The criticism of the FtT was totally without merit as Class 3  National
    Insurance Contributions were voluntary and could be paid by  those  who
    are unemployed and not claiming benefits.

12.  Ground 3 was without merit as the FtT [13] took  into  account  at  the
    appellant had only recently "taken out health insurance  and  that  the
    sponsor had left the UK in 2011".

Error of Law Hearing

13.  At the hearing Mr Youssefian and Mr Bramble made  further  submissions.
    Mr Bramble conceded that contrary to the position taken in the Rules 24
    response, it was now accepted that the FtT had erred in  miscalculating
    the five year period of continuous residence.

14.  Mr Youssefian expanded on ground 2 and  3   arguing  that  this  was  a
    material error such that the determination should  be  set  aside.   He
    submitted that whilst the National Insurance Contributions under  Class
    3 were in effect a voluntary contribution, the evidence ought  properly
    to have been considered with all the evidence establishing that the EEA
    national was economically active.  He submitted that  the  NI  document
    (page 28 A/B) showed two  different  figures  for  contributions  made,
    which was an indicator that there must have been one contribution  paid
    as a result of employment.  The FtT failed  to  consider  the  Class  1
    Contributions and had not taken into account the evidence given by  the
    parties on this issue.  Further the FtT failed  to  take  into  account
    that the appellant had been issued with residence  cards  in  2005  and
    2006; the issuance of which required the  respondent  to  be  satisfied
    that the EEA national produced evidence of being  a  qualified  person.
    There was unchallenged evidence that the documentary evidence submitted
    in support of the applications for the two residence cards had not been
    returned by the Secretary of State.

15.  As to ground 3 Mr Youssefian submitted that the FtT failed to  consider
    the alternative submission under Regulation  15  for  the  grant  of  a
    residence card.  This failure amounted to a material error  of  law  as
    the appellant was able to show that he met the necessary Regulations at
    the date of hearing.

16.  Mr Bramble submitted that notwithstanding his acceptance of  the  error
    in miscalculation, it was only material if the other grounds were  made
    out.

17.  Mr Bramble submitted that there was insufficient  evidence  before  the
    FtT to establish that the EEA national  was  in  work  and  or  details
    thereof.  The unpaid tax demand was not an indication of work  done  or
    hours or period covered.  The FtT was permitted to consider aspects  of
    the evidence of economic activity between 2005 and 2007 and to conclude
    that there was a paucity of evidence.

18.  Mr Bramble submitted that as at  the  date  of  hearing  the  appellant
    failed to establish  evidence  that  the  sponsor/EEA  national  was  a
    qualified person as a self-sufficient person.

19.  Mr Youssefian responded.

Discussion and Decision

20.  I decided that there was a material error of law in  the  decision  and
    reasons.  It was conceded by Mr Bramble that Ground 1 was made out. The
    FtT miscalculated the period of five years'  continuous  residence  and
    failed to specify a start date and thereafter further erred by  finding
    that that continuous period  was  broken.  I  am  satisfied  that  this
    amounts to a material error because the FtT's further consideration  of
    evidence was infected by the miscalculation of the relevant  period  of
    time.  I am further satisfied that ground 2 is made out.  The EEA  Regs
    require evidence to show that the EEA national is a qualified person in
    specified categories, in this instance as a worker for the duration  of
    the five year period.  The FtT failed to take into account all  of  the
    relevant and material evidence,  including  the  written  evidence,  in
    reaching its conclusions that the EEA  national  was  not  a  qualified
    person for the relevant period.  In particular the FtT failed to  place
    weight on the very significant evidence that  the  appellant  had  been
    granted residence cards in 2005 and 2007, and the unchallenged evidence
    that the Secretary of State had retained the  documentary  evidence  in
    support of applications in 2004,  2005  and  2008.  The  FtT  erred  by
    restricting its assessment to particular aspects  of  the  evidence  in
    isolation. Looking at the evidence in the round  I  am  satisfied  that
    there was sufficient evidence to establish that the  EEA  national  was
    working. The regulations do not require specific evidence of the nature
    and details of any work done and the FtT erred in its approach in  this
    regard [11].  Whilst accepting that the payment  of  Class  3  National
    Insurance Contributions were  voluntary  contributions,  there  was  no
    consideration by the FtT that the EEA national was otherwise working. I
    accept also that the FtT [13]did not adequately consider or  reach  any
    decision on the alternative submission made under Regs 14 and 17.





Decision

21.  There is a material error of law in  the  decision  and  reasons  which
    shall be set aside.  I remake the decision by substituting  a  decision
    to allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules (EEA)  Regulations  and
    grant the appellant a permanent residence card as the family member  of
    an EEA national under Regulation  15(1)(b)  of  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006.

No anonymity direction is made.
