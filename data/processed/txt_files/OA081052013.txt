Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms O Rees, Sponsor
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Cuba who was born on  27  December  1972.
    On 29 January 2013, he applied for entry clearance to  join  his  wife,
    Orquidea Rees, a British citizen in the United Kingdom.  On 21 February
    2013, the Entry Clearance Officer refused the  appellant's  application
    on  the  basis  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the   financial
    requirement in Appendix FM, namely that the sponsor had a gross  annual
    income of �18,600  (see  E-ECP3.1).   On  13  August  2013,  the  Entry
    Clearance Manager confirmed that decision on the basis that the P60 for
    the tax year 2012-2013 disclosed a gross income of �15,306.12 based  on
    the sponsor's employment as a Care Assistant with the  Peninsular  Care
    Homes Limited where she had been employed since April 2006.

 2. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and did not  seek  an
    oral hearing.  On 10 December 2013, dealing with the appellant's appeal
    on the papers, Judge Deavin dismissed the  appellant's  appeal  on  the
    basis that he had not established that the sponsor's gross  income  was
    at least �18,600.

 3. Judge Deavin took into account that the relevant P60 showed  an  income
    of �15,306 for the tax year 2012-2013.  He also noted that the  sponsor
    claimed to earn on average, approximately �4,000 per year extra  income
    from the University of Exeter hosting students at her home.  The  judge
    noted that the letter from the University of Exeter, whilst recognising
    that the sponsor would receive �109 per week when she hosted a student,
    provided no evidence of actual payment.  In the grounds, the  appellant
    claimed that this would generate an additional income of  approximately
    �4,000  per  year.   The  judge  noted  that  the  agreement  with  the
    university could allow the sponsor to generate an annual  gross  income
    of �6,540 by hosting two students over the academic year.  In addition,
    the sponsor claimed that she had two cleaning jobs for  which  she  was
    paid �48 per week.  However, Judge Deavin concluded that  the  evidence
    of her additional work beyond that of her employment by the  Peninsular
    Care Homes Limited postdated the decision and could not be  taken  into
    account in the appeal.  Consequently, on the basis of her P60  for  the
    tax year 2012-2013, he concluded  that  the  appellant  had  failed  to
    establish that the sponsor had  a  gross  annual  income  of  at  least
    �18,600 and so he dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 4. The appellant sought permission to appeal and on 13  January  2014  the
    First-tier Tribunal (UTJ Deans) granted  the  appellant  permission  to
    appeal on the basis that the judge was wrong to  exclude  post-decision
    evidence provided that it related to the circumstances appertaining  at
    the date of decision.  Thus, the appeal came before us.

 5. The sponsor appeared at the hearing.  She sought to argue that she  had
    sufficient  income  to  meet  the  requirements  in  the   Rules.    In
    particular, she relied upon the additional income which she claimed she
    earned by hosting students from the University of Exeter.

 6. It was clear from the sponsor,  and  indeed  from  a  letter  from  her
    employer dated 7 January 2014, that the sponsor has been  on  maternity
    leave since 1 April  2013  and  has  not  returned  to  her  employment
    following the birth of her and the appellant's son in April 2013.   The
    sponsor told us that she had sent a P60  for  the  2012-2013  tax  year
    following the refusal  of  the  appellant's  visa  in  June  2013.   In
    addition, the judge had no bank statements which  showed  any  payments
    from the University of Exeter.  The sponsor told us that  she  received
    the money in cash and that sometimes she paid it in to the bank  whilst
    on other occasions she kept the cash to spend.  She acknowledged before
    us that she had not paid any  tax  on  money  received  in  cash.   She
    expressed surprise that she was required to do so.

 7. The only evidence before the judge (and indeed before  us)  that  meets
    the requirements of the Rules was the sponsor's P60 for  the  tax  year
    2011-2012 which shows a gross employment income of �15,306  which  does
    not demonstrate a gross  income  of  at  least  �18,600.   Indeed,  the
    sponsor's more recent P60 for the tax year 2012-2013  (even  if  before
    Judge Deavin) still falls short of that figure,  demonstrating  only  a
    gross income of �16,560.21.  Whilst the judge was required to take into
    account evidence submitted  after  the  ECO's  decision,  he  was  only
    required to do so to the extent that it was  relevant  to  whether  the
    appellant could show, on  the  basis  of  the  sponsor's  income,  that
    together they could demonstrate a  gross  annual  income  of  at  least
    �18,600.  The sponsor was simply unable to  show  actual  gross  income
    received from the University of Exeter, or directly from students  that
    she hosted, to supplement the only evidence before  Judge  Deavin  that
    satisfied the evidential requirements of the Rules, namely her P60  for
    2011-2012 showing her gross income to be �15,306.  There  was  also  no
    documentary evidence, whether satisfying the evidential requirements of
    the Rules or not, in relation to any income received from  her  claimed
    cleaning jobs.

 8. Consequently, on the evidence presented  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    Judge Deavin was, in our judgment, correct to find  that  the  evidence
    did not establish that the appellant met the financial requirements  in
    Appendix FM and that therefore the  appellant's  appeal  was  correctly
    dismissed under the Immigration Rules.

 9. At no point has the appellant relied upon Art 8 of the ECHR  and  given
    the unsatisfactory state of the evidence  presented  by  the  appellant
    including that of the sponsor concerning her additional claimed income,
    we see no basis upon which the appellant could succeed under Art  8  on
    the evidence presented in the appeal.

10. For these reasons, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  to  dismiss
    the appellant's appeal stands.

                                                                     A Grubb
                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal
