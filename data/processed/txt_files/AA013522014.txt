Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr S Khan, instructed by Malik & Malik Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, WA, date of birth 14.8.96, is a citizen of  Afghanistan.



 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Burns, promulgated 11.9.14  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    decision of the  respondent,  dated  14.2.14,  to  refuse  his  asylum,
    humanitarian protection and human rights claims and to remove him  from
    the UK as an illegal entrant. The Judge heard the appeal on 22.8.14.

 3. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Kelly  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    7.10.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 13.11.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Burns should be set aside.

 6. The refusal and removal decision was made following  an  assessment  by
    the local authority on 7.11.11 that the appellant's date of  birth  was
    14.8.96, two years earlier  than  the  appellant's  claim  of  14.8.98.
    However, the decision was made on the  basis  that  the  appellant  was
    nevertheless a minor  at  the  date  when  he  claimed  asylum.  It  is
    asserted, incorrectly, that the age assessment had  been  withdrawn  by
    the date  of  the  appeal  hearing.  The  grounds  of  application  for
    permission to appeal assert  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in
    refusing the appellant's application to adjourn the appeal  hearing  in
    order to await the outcome of a re-assessment of the appellant's age.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Kelly  said,  "It  is  arguable
    that the Tribunal did not act fairly in refusing the  application  for,
    amongst others, the following reasons: (i) the appellant's age  -  both
    at the time of his asylum interview and at the hearing of his appeal  -
    was potentially relevant to the assessment of his credibility, (ii) the
    Tribunal did not make any explicit finding concerning  the  appellant's
    age, but its reasoning at paragraph 52 is nevertheless consistent  only
    with it having preferred the assessment of the local authority over the
    claims made by and on behalf of the appellant, and (iii)  there  is  no
    acknowledgement by the  Tribunal  that  the  assessment  of  the  local
    authority had been withdrawn. It is thus  arguable  that  the  Tribunal
    ought either to have acceded to the application to adjourn, or to  have
    based its assessment of the appellant's credibility  upon  his  claimed
    age at the material times. It is also arguable that it failed  to  take
    account of material  evidence.  Permission  to  appeal  is  accordingly
    granted."

 8. The grant of permission was  based  upon  factual  inaccuracies.  By  a
    letter dated 11.11.14 it is explained that judicial review  proceedings
    have been issued challenging the "lawfulness and correctness of an  age
    assessment conducted by the Croydon LBC in July 2014."  Whilst  Croydon
    has agreed to carry out a further assessment, which will supersede  the
    July  2014  assessment,  "The  decision  of  July  2014  has  not  been
    withdrawn." It is thus incorrect to assert that the age assessment  had
    been withdrawn and that the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in  failing
    to acknowledge the supposed withdrawal or take it into account.  It  is
    not clear to me whether it was asserted before the First-tier  Tribunal
    appeal hearing that the age assessment had been withdrawn, but even  if
    it had, such an assertion was inaccurate. It follows that there  was  a
    valid age assessment, maintained by Croydon LBC, before the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge and he was entitled to  take  it  into  account  and  to
    prefer that assessment over the appellant's unsupported  assertions  as
    to his true age.

 9. In the light of the above, the only material issue in the appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal is whether it was  fair  or  unfair  for  the  judge  to
    proceed to hear the appeal  on  22.8.14,  or  whether  he  should  have
    acceded to the adjournment request.

10. An application for an adjournment had been made in writing prior to the
    appeal hearing and refused on 5.8.14.  The  appellant's  representative
    produced a skeleton argument to Judge Burns  renewing  the  adjournment
    request. It appears that the appeal had already been put back for  some
    3 months, during which time "it was hoped that the dispute  in  respect
    of our client's age would be settled." The judge was informed that  the
    dispute had not yet  been  settled,  but  no  further  information  was
    provided. The written refusal of the adjournment  request  had  advised
    the appellant's solicitors that unless there was further  evidence  the
    case would proceed on whatever evidence was available on the issue.

11. The renewed application for an adjournment was considered by the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge, who noted at  �26  that  it  was  opposed  by  the
    representative of the Secretary of State, who submitted that  the  case
    had been dragging on for  some  time.  The  appellant's  representative
    submitted that the age assessment would have a bearing  on  credibility
    and thus should be allowed. The judge noted that there was no letter or
    other information as to when  such  further  age  assessment  would  be
    provided. There was no guarantee or even likelihood  that  any  further
    age assessment would result in any different outcome to the  assessment
    already before the Tribunal. The respondent's representative  submitted
    that in the event of fresh information as to age it was open to make  a
    fresh challenge to the refusal decision.  On  the  limited  information
    available to the First-tier Tribunal Judge, he saw no justification for
    the adjournment and refused the application.

12. I am satisfied that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  acted  perfectly
    properly on the  limited  information  available  to  him  which  might
    justify an adjournment. Time had already been granted for  further  age
    assessment but nothing was forthcoming and there was no indication when
    there might. Neither was it the case that the age assessment  had  been
    withdrawn, as has been asserted. There was  nothing  before  the  judge
    upon which he could have reached the conclusion that the age assessment
    by the local authority was flawed or otherwise unreliable.

13. It is further relevant that the Secretary of State had proceeded on the
    basis that the appellant was still a  minor  at  the  date  he  claimed
    asylum. On his claim he would have been 13, on the  Croydon  assessment
    he was 15 and thus had turned 18 by the date of the appeal hearing.

14. In fairness to the appellant, at �52 the  judge  considered  that  "his
    credibility should be assessed  within  the  broad  parameters  of  the
    conflicting ages offered." The judge decided  to  make  no  credibility
    finding against the appellant for having potentially given a false age.
    The judge also carefully considered the age assessment and found it  to
    be reliable. However, as can be seen  from  �53  the  judge  was  still
    keeping an open mind as to the appellant's age  and  reached  the  view
    that whatever his age, there  were  still  serious  problems  with  the
    appellant's account. There was a change in evidence  and  inconsistency
    in the appellant's case as to when he allegedly left  the  family  home
    following his  father's  death.  The  judge  said,  "Whatever  age  the
    appellant might have been, this is an event  that  would  have,  in  my
    finding, remained pretty well branded on  the  memory  and  I  was  not
    persuaded that the appellant was being  honest  and  truthful  on  this
    point. Rather, I concluded that the appellant was adapting his evidence
    to fit in with changing circumstances." I find  that  on  the  evidence
    this was a finding open to the judge and for which he has given  cogent
    reasoning whilst at the  same  time  considering  the  appellant's  age
    assertion. Ultimately, by �57 of the decision  the  judge  reached  the
    conclusion that the appellant's claim was bogus and made up, "and  that
    the appellant's entire history showed a determination to  come  to  the
    United Kingdom."

15. The findings of the First-tier Tribunal Judge are ones which were  open
    to him to make  and  for  which  cogent  reasons  have  been  provided.
    Further, it does not seem to me that even if the appellant were only 13
    at the time he claimed asylum on 8.10.11, due allowance for his age  in
    any credibility assessment could have produced any different outcome to
    the appeal. The documentary evidence, rejected by the  judge,  did  not
    depend on the appellant's age and the basic facts of  his  claim,  also
    rejected by the judge, would have been the same whatever age.  This  is
    not the sort of situation of an inability to remember, or confusion  by
    reason of lack of understanding, or  immaturity,  that  might  be  age-
    dependant. The  appellant's  account  was  rejected  wholesale  in  its
    entirety.

16. In all the circumstances, I find that there was  nothing  unfair  about
    the way in which the  judge  refused  the  application  for  a  further
    adjournment or conducted the appeal hearing.  Even  now,  there  is  no
    other age assessment and Croydon has decided not to  withdraw  its  age
    assessment. At this stage, whether a further assessment would produce a
    different outcome is entirely a matter of speculation. In fairness, the
    judge evidently allowed a degree of latitude in the assessment  of  the
    evidence for the possibility of  a  wider  age  range,  but  ultimately
    concluded that whatever age the appellant was,  his  evidence  was  not
    credible. Despite there being what he  considered  to  be  a  perfectly
    proper age assessment, and no reasons were advanced for suggestion that
    it was flawed, the judge deliberately ignored any  adverse  credibility
    there might have flowed from making a false age claim.  The  judge  did
    not seek in fact to fix the appellant's age but  applied,  as  had  the
    respondent, a broad age range when considering the credibility  of  the
    appellant's account. The judge did not rely on small  discrepancies  or
    variations in the appellant's accounts in making credibility  findings,
    but rather on flaws in the main 'planks' of the appellant's  case  that
    no age assessment could  provide  explanation  or  justify  making  any
    allowance for. In any event, the appellant's  representative  has  been
    unable to point me to any finding in the determination  of  the  First-
    tier  Tribunal  that  would  or  could  have  been  different  had  the
    appellant's age been accepted to be as he claimed.

Conclusion & Decision:

17. For the reasons set out above, I find that he making of the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did make an order pursuant to  rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I continue anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
