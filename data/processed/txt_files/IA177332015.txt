Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Z Malik, Counsel, instructed by Whitefield
Solicitors Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant has permission to  challenge  a  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal (FtT)  Judge  Lloyd-Smith  promulgated  on  18  November  2015
    dismissing his appeal against a decision made by the respondent  on  29
    April 2015 refusing leave to remain on private and family life grounds.
     The appellant advances but a "single ground"  and  that  is  that  the
    judge erred in law in failing to engage with s.117B(6) of the NIAA 2002
    as amended and its approach to the welfare of the  child.   In  essence
    the point made is that the judge should have found that  the  appellant
    met in full the requirements  of  s.117B(6)  because  his  daughter  by
    virtue of being a British citizen was a "qualifying child" and he has a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with a qualifying child".  Although
    the grounds dwell on the case law on best interests of  the  child,  as
    enunciated in ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC  4  in  particular,  there  has
    since they were drafted been judicial confirmation that s.117B(6) is  a
    self-contained set of  requirements  such  that  if  they  are  met  an
    applicant  is  entitled  to  succeed  on  Article  8  grounds:  see  MA
    (Pakistan)  &  Ors,  R  (on  the  application  of)  v  Upper   Tribunal
    (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) & Anor [2016] EWCA Civ 705.   In  [19]
    of this judgment Elias, LJ stated that the only questions which  courts
    and Tribunals need to ask when applying s.117B(6) are the following:

         "...


         (2)  Does the applicant have  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
             relationship with the child?


         (3)  Is the child a qualifying child as defined in section 117D?


         (4)  Is it unreasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the  United
             Kingdom?"

    For the purposes of analysing this case it is simplest  to  take  these
    questions in reverse order


2.   As regards question (4), it is not in dispute that the  child  involved
    (Miss I) cannot reasonably be expected to leave the UK.

3.   As regards question (3), the appellant produced a copy of  the  child's
    British passport.  There is an  issue,  which  was  identified  by  the
    judge, as to whether that passport was obtained on the  basis  of  true
    particulars because the child's birth certificate names another man  as
    the father, whereas on the basis of  DNA  evidence  the  appellant  has
    established that he is the natural father.  But in the absence of steps
    being  taken  by  the  respondent  to  deprive  the  child  of  British
    citizenship,  the  appellant  was  entitled  to  say  that  she  was  a
    qualifying child within the meaning of s.117D and that  is  indeed  the
    basis on which the judge proceeded to deal with the case.

4.   All turns, therefore, on the judge's treatment of  question  (2)  "Does
    the applicant have a genuine and subsisting parental relationship  with
    the child?"


5.   In the  written  grounds  as  amplified  by  Mr  Malik  two  particular
    passages of the judge's decision are highlighted, [12] and [18] and  it
    will assist to set them out in full as follows:

         "12. I have considered the DNA  evidence,  which  is  unchallenged.
             This shows that the appellant or a close male relative of  his
             is the father of the  child.   I  find  the  appellant  to  be
             incredible in relation to the account  he  has  given  of  his
             relationship with the child.  If he is the  biological  father
             then for the reasons that I have set out above I do not accept
             that the appellant is still in a relationship with the sponsor
             or that he has regular contact and is influential in the  life
             of the child.  In any event, if he is  the  biological  father
             then, at birth it seems that the child  was  not  entitled  to
             British  nationality  because   her   mother   only   obtained
             settlement on 19th June 2013 and the appellant clearly had  no
             British status at the time of her birth.  That would therefore
             potentially affect the assessment of her best interests.


         ...


         18.  The facts of this case can be distinguished from ZH (Tanzania)
             because of the appalling immigration history of the appellant;
             the child is not a British citizen by descent  but  rather  by
             fortune of  where  she  was  born;  even  if  her  mother  had
             citizenship at the time of her birth she was  conceived  at  a
             time when the appellant's immigration  status  was  precarious
             and he is not the primary carer for her.  In addition [Miss I]
             is only 3ï¿½ and whilst she has spent all of her  life  in  this
             country, she has just begun her education which clearly it  is
             at the earliest stage.  She has always lived with  her  mother
             who, it would appear has sole responsibility  for  her.   That
             situation would not change.  It seems apparent that  were  the
             appellant to be unsuccessful his partner would remain  in  the
             UK with the child.  As is apparent from my findings I  do  not
             accept that the appellant is involved in this child's life  to
             the extent that is claimed.  The application stated  that  all
             contact  was  being  done  secretly  or  over  the   telephone
             therefore this level of contact  could  easily  be  maintained
             through modern means of technology whilst the appellant is  in
             Pakistan.  It would also be open to the sponsor to  visit  the
             appellant with her daughter in Pakistan if she chooses not  to
             relocate with him.  That would not be  a  difficulty  for  the
             child because the appellant said that they speak Urdu at  home
             and therefore there would be  no  language  barrier.   Clearly
             Pakistan is a country in which she would obtain a decent level
             of education."

6.   The grounds contend that nowhere in these or any other  paragraphs  did
    the judge address or reach a conclusion on the matter of whether  there
    was a genuine and  subsisting  relationship.   The  word  "genuine"  in
    ordinary language means valid  or  legitimate  and  the  appellant  had
    proved by DNA evidence that he was  the  father.   In  the  absence  of
    fabrication of a biological link, the judge should have  accepted  that
    the relationship was plainly genuine.

7.   Likewise, the grounds contended,  the  word  "subsisting"  in  ordinary
    language contemplates something that exists.  It is perfectly  possible
    to have a subsisting relationship where the other parent is the one who
    is taking an active part in the child's upbringing or  even  where  the
    other parent (as here) has the sole responsibility.  The term  used  in
    the   legislation   is   "parental   relationship",    not    "parental
    responsibility".  It is also perfectly possible for a parent to have  a
    "subsisting relationship" with a child when he is not  residing  or  is
    not in regular contact.  Accordingly the FtT's findings that the mother
    had "... sole responsibility" [for Miss I] and that  the  appellant  is
    not "influential in her life" does not equate to a finding  that  there
    is no "subsisting parental relationship".

8.   The grounds also took the judge to task for giving  fallacious  reasons
    for distinguishing the appellant's case from ZH (Tanzania).

9.   I do not find that the appellant's "single ground" is made out.

10.  Clearly, the wording of  s.117B(6)(a)  reflects  the  necessity  for  a
    person seeking to benefit from it to  show  that  there  is  a  factual
    content to the claimed relationship with the child and in so doing  its
    terms are entirely consistent with the requirement of s.55 to treat the
    best  interests  of  the  child  as  a  primary  consideration.    This
    requirement corresponds to the Article 8(1) requirement to establish  a
    factual content to the right to respect for private  and  family  life.
    Accordingly, it is for an  applicant  to  show  that  the  relationship
    relied on does have the necessary factual content.

11.   The  judge  can  be  criticised  for  not  expressly  identifying   or
    addressing the requirements of s.117B(6) or analysing them in  the  way
    set out in MA (Pakistan).  But this failure can only be a material  one
    if his assessment did not in substance address and answer the  relevant
    point.  In the appellant's case, it is apparent that the judge did  not
    accept the appellant's claims about the strength  and  quality  of  his
    relationship with Miss I.  At [9] he recorded that he did not find  the
    appellant (or sponsor) a credible witness and he went on to note  inter
    alia the appellant's previous use of deception by entering into a  sham
    marriage  which  he  claimed  was  genuine.   He  also  noted  material
    inconsistencies in the appellant's (and sponsor's)  evidence  regarding
    the nature of their relationship and his relationship with Miss A.  For
    example, at [11(iii)] the appellant's claim  that  the  child's  school
    knew of the appellant was roundly rejected.

12.   It  is  important  to  observe  that  there  has  been  no   challenge
    whatsoever, to the judge's findings of fact.

13.  The clear consequence of the judge's adverse findings of fact was  that
    the appellant had not persuaded the  judge  that  his  account  of  his
    relationship with his daughter  was  a  credible  one:  see:  e.g.  his
    statement to that effect in [12].  On any reading of this determination
    it is impossible to conclude that the judge accepted that the appellant
    has discharged the onus of proof on him to show that  his  relationship
    with the child was one  that  could  be  described  as  genuine  or  of
    meaningful content.

14.  To the extent that the judge's findings  include  acceptance  that  the
    appellant had  a  biological  relationship  with  the  child  and  some
    "contact" and some "involvement" in the child's  life,  it  is  equally
    clear that the judge considered this to fall short of the  requirements
    of s.117B or of Article 8(1).

15.  Mr Malik may be right that the concept of  "a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship" is one that can accommodate a broad spectrum  of
    relationships, including situations in which a  parent  does  not  have
    primary care and does  not  live  in  the  same  house  as  the  child.
    However, on any proper understanding of that test,  the  judge's  clear
    and reasonable assessment was that the appellant had not shown that his
    relationship with Miss A came within it.  Mr Malik invokes the ordinary
    meaning of the terms "genuine" and "subsisting", but  on  his  argument
    the mere fact of a biological relationship  plus  the  barest  type  of
    contact or involvement would suffice to satisfy the requirement.   Such
    a reading offends both ordinary meaning and common sense.  It  is  also
    contrary to the approach taken by the AIT in the  starred  case  of  GA
    ("Subsisting" marriage) Ghana [2006] UKAIT 00046 which stated  that  an
    enquiry into whether a marriage was subsisting  entailed  consideration
    of the "nature and quality of the substance of the  relationship"  [8].
    The term clearly denotes relationships which have a  minimum  level  of
    meaningful content.  Such a reading would also conflict with  the  very
    principle which the grounds say governs the requirement  of  s.117B(6),
    namely the best interests of the child.  The need for the term "genuine
    and subsisting parental relationship" to compare with the principle  of
    the best interests of the child reinforces this observation.  It  could
    not conceivably be in the best interests of the child to have  to  rely
    on an empty shell of a parental relationship.

16.   I  would  accept  that  the  judge   gave   inadequate   reasons   for
    distinguishing the facts of  the  appellant's  case  from  the  general
    guidance given in  ZH  (Tanzania)  but  on  the  judge's  findings  the
    appellant's case could not come within the terms of that guidance since
    it was concerned with cases where there was a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship between the relevant parent and child.

17.  For the above reasons I conclude that the FtT Judge did not  materially
    err in law.  Her decision to dismiss the appellant's appeal must stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
