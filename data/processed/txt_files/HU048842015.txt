                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Gurung-Thapa, promulgated on  15th  November  2016,  following  a
    hearing at Stoke-on-Trent on 24th October 2016.  In the  determination,
    the  judge  dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the
    Appellant subsequently applied for,  and  was  granted,  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria, is a female, and was born on [ ]
    1979.  She appeals against the decision of the  Respondent  dated  19th
    August 2015 refusing her application for leave to remain in the  UK  on
    the basis of her family and private life.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The essence of the Appellant's claim is that,  having  been  granted  a
    visit visa on 13th December 2007, following which she entered the UK in
    March 2008, she gave birth  to  her  son,  [DE],  in  the  UK  on  18th
    September 2011.  Her son [DE] is a national of Nigeria  and  is  now  4
    years old.  Although [DE] is not a British citizen and has not lived in
    the UK for at least seven years, he had a relationship with his father,
    who had leave to remain in the UK until 24th March 2019, and also  with
    his half-brother, [J], who resides in the Netherlands with his  mother.



 4. The Appellant, who made her application on 14th April 2015 for leave to
    remain in the UK on the basis of her family and  private  life,  cannot
    remain in the UK on this basis, because even if there is a relationship
    between [DE] and his father, the father can return to Nigeria before or
    when his leave expires, and he could also visit [DE] in Nigeria  as  he
    currently has leave to remain.

The Judge's Findings

 5. The judge took note of the witness statement of [DE]'s father,  namely,
    [FE], which was dated 14th April 2015,  where  he  asserts  he  is  the
    biological father of [DE], and has been resident in the UK since  2005,
    and obtained a right of residence as a dependant of an EEA national  in
    June 2007 (this EEA national being the Dutch mother of [J], and was now
    returned back to the Netherlands with [J], the half-brother of [DE]).

 6. The judge noted how [FE] was granted residence  on  the  basis  of  his
    marriage to a Dutch national, who became his wife in 2007, and that  he
    is presently in the process of applying for indefinite leave to remain,
    on the basis of his ten years' residence as a settled partner of an EEA
    national (see paragraph 28).  The  judge  observed  how,  since  [DE]'s
    birth, he has seen  him  regularly,  because  [DE]  comes  to  see  him
    virtually every weekend and often  stays  overnight.   There  was  also
    evidence from him that [DE] has a  good  relationship  with  his  half-
    brother [J].

 7. Nevertheless, the judge held that she could not be satisfied that [FE],
    whose evidence was not tested in cross-examination, was playing a  full
    and active role as [DE]'s father, because [FE] simply  did  not  attend
    the hearing and the judge held that, "I reject  the  Appellant's  claim
    that she was not advised for [DE]'s father to attend" (paragraph 31).

 8. The judge went on to conclude that this was a case where the  Appellant
    had spent the majority of her life in Nigeria and there is no reason to
    believe that she has lost all social, cultural  or  family  ties  there
    (paragraph 55).  The  Appellant  was  found  by  the  judge  to  be  an
    intelligent and resourceful woman who had established herself in the UK
    despite having no family here (paragraph 56).

 9. Although the evidence from the Appellant before the judge was that [DE]
    only spoke English this was  a  language  that  was  widely  spoken  in
    Nigeria and there was nothing to suggest that [DE] would not be able to
    enter the education system in Nigeria (paragraph 57).

10. The appeal was dismissed.

11.  On  5th  June  2017,  permission  to  appeal  was  granted,  with  the
    observation that the grounds largely amounted to  little  more  than  a
    disagreement with the findings of the judge, but there was an  arguable
    point in the suggestion that the Appellant's son [DE] enjoyed a  family
    life with his half-brother, [J], who is  permanently  resident  in  the
    Netherlands.

12. In granting permission, the observation was made that the judge did not
    make findings as to the nature and extent of family life  between  [DE]
    and [J] and did not go on to consider whether such a relationship would
    be subject to a disproportionate interference if [DE], aged 5 years  at
    the date of hearing, were to leave the UK with the Appellant.

13. A Rule 24 response was entered dated 16th June 2017 to the effect  that
    the relationship between [DE] and the half-brother, [J], was duly noted
    by the judge, and this was evident from the points noted by  the  judge
    at paragraphs 11 and 29 of the determination.

Submissions

14. At the hearing before me the Appellant was unrepresented, but  she  was
    in attendance, and she stated that the father of [DE], [FE], was in the
    UK and had valid leave to remain until 2019.  Her son, [DE], had  spent
    all his life in this country.  He had not had a stable life so far  and
    it will be wrong to disrupt his life by requiring him to go to  Nigeria
    with her, were she to be compelled to do so, and that  it  was  in  his
    interest to remain in this country.

15. For his part, Mr Mills submitted that there was only one issue in  this
    appeal, and that was the relationship between  the  two  half-brothers,
    namely, that of  [DE],  with  his  half-brother  now  resident  in  the
    Netherlands, by the name of [J].  In the midst of this, there was [FE],
    the two children's father.  He, however, was in  the  UK  with  an  EEA
    card, only because he had been married to a Dutch lady, in  consequence
    of which he had been granted rights of residence.

16. That marriage, however, had subsequently broken down.  It is now  being
    said that  the  judge  did  not  give  adequate  consideration  to  the
    relationship between the two half-brothers.  This is  quite  untenable,
    submitted Mr Mills, because one child, [J], lives in Holland  with  his
    Dutch mother, and the other child, [DE], lives  in  the  UK,  with  his
    Nigerian mother.  What relationship they  have,  is  maintained  either
    through modern means of communication, or by  occasional  visits,  when
    during the school holidays one flies out to meet the other.

17. There is no reason why  either  of  these  things  cannot  happen,  and
    continue to happen, if the Appellant were to return to Nigeria with her
    son, [DE].  The two half-brothers could communicate by modern  mean  of
    communication or could visit  each  other,  because  there  is  nothing
    stopping [J] from visiting [DE] in Nigeria.

18. Second, the judge at paragraph 43 had found that,

         "... there is a family life between the Appellant and  [DE].   They
         can both be removed as a family unit.  For the reasons given  above
         I cannot accept that [DE] has a relationship with his father.  Even
         if I am wrong in this regard, the fact is that they are not  living
         together in a family unit" (paragraph 43).

19. Third, the right to reside in the UK of [FE], was entirely questionable
    at present because his initial right to  remain  in  this  country  was
    based upon his relationship with his Dutch wife, which had since broken
    down, such that she had returned back  to  the  Netherlands.   She  had
    taken [J] with her.  In these circumstances, the  father  of  both  the
    children, [FE], had no right to remain in this country any longer.

No Error of Law

20. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.  My  reasons  are
    as follows.

21. First, the judge has found there to be no relationship between [DE] and
    his father,  [FE]  (see  paragraph  43).   Even  if  there  is  such  a
    relationship, there is nothing stopping the Appellant and [DE] going to
    Nigeria, as the judge found.  In this  respect,  the  findings  of  the
    judge echo the concerns of the Respondent Secretary of State as set out
    at paragraph 11 of the determination.

22.  Second,  insofar  as  there  is  a  relationship   between   the   two
    stepbrothers, namely, [DE] and [J], this  is  a  relationship  that  is
    undertaken on the basis of their residence  in  two  entirely  separate
    countries, namely, in the United Kingdom and in the Netherlands, and it
    is undertaken on the basis of visits  that  they  make  to  each  other
    during the school holidays, such that the same can  be  done  were  the
    Appellant and [DE] to return to Nigeria.  The judge has so  found,  and
    the judge has given a consideration, to the public interest requirement
    under Section 117B of the 2002 Act.

23. In this regard, ample consideration was given to what was in the  "best
    interest" of the child, but noted that [DE] was not a qualifying  child
    (see paragraph 54, and that the Appellant  herself  had  not  lost  all
    cultural or family ties in Nigeria (paragraph 55).  [DE] spoke  English
    and could easily integrate into life in Nigeria (paragraph 57).

24. In short, this is a case where the judge has made entirely  sustainable
    findings of fact on the  evidence  before  her,  and  has  applied  the
    relevant case law (see paragraphs 32 to 42) to the  facts  before  her.
    There is no error of law.

Notice of Decision

There is no material error of law in the  original  judge's  decision.   The
determination shall stand.
