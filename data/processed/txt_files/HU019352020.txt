For the Respondent:    Mr S Nwaekwu of Moorehouse Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Secretary of State appeals with permission to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    against the decision of  the  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  who
    allowed the appeal  of  Mr  Makpa  against  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision of 24  September  2019  refusing  his  application  for  entry
    clearance as the spouse of his wife, who is present and settled in  the
    United  Kingdom,  having  been  naturalised,  with  the  couple's  four
    children, who are also British citizens.

2.   I shall refer hereafter to the Secretary of State  as  the  respondent,
    as she was before the judge, and to Mr Makpa as the  appellant,  as  he
    was before the judge.

3.   The basis of the respondent's decision was that  the  appellant  failed
    to meet the financial eligibility requirements of Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  In particular there was no evidence  provided  that
    his sponsor and  wife  had  a  gross  income  of  �18,600.   The  self-
    employment documentation submitted did not meet the requirements of the
    Rules in respect of cash savings as there  was  a  failure  to  provide
    evidence of savings held for at least six months of at least �62,500 in
    the form specified by paragraph 11 of Appendix FM-SE.  In addition  the
    respondent was not satisfied that there were exceptional  circumstances
    which would render refusal a breach of  the  appellant's  rights  under
    Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

4.   As noted by the judge at paragraph 6 of the decision,  the  appellant's
    position was that there was no documentation relating to the sponsor as
    she did not do sufficient  work  due  to  childcare  commitments.   The
    documentation relating to savings did not meet the requirements of  the
    Rules, but the refusal would breach Article 8 as  it  would  result  in
    unjustifiably harsh consequence  for  the  appellant  and  his  family.
    Consequently, it was argued, the judge was  required  to  take  a  more
    flexible approach to the financial  information  provided  pursuant  to
    paragraph 21A of Appendix FM-SE, which  allowed  the  judge  to  assess
    whether the minimum income requirement could be met through  any  other
    credible and reliable source of  income,  financial  support  or  funds
    available to the couple.

5.   The judge concluded that there were exceptional circumstances  so  that
    the refusal to allow the application breached  the  appellant  and  his
    family's Article 8 rights because the refusal resulted and continued to
    result in unduly harsh consequences for the appellant, the children and
    the sponsor.  The judge said that she heard  extensive  and  compelling
    evidence during the hearing on the impact of the  continued  separation
    in particular on the children, which is significant.  The children  had
    spent their whole life in the United Kingdom and had been to Nigeria on
    a few occasions for short visits but had never lived there.  The  judge
    said that she was satisfied, given the children's life  in  the  United
    Kingdom, on which she heard evidence regarding friends  and  schooling,
    that requiring them to relocate permanently to Nigeria, where they  had
    never lived, would not promote  their  welfare  or  be  in  their  best
    interests and would be  disproportionate.   She  considered  this  fact
    against the public interest in  maintaining  immigration  control  when
    considering proportionality.

6.   The judge considered the evidence at the date  of  decision  and  found
    that the savings combined with the money available to the appellant and
    the sponsor and  the  business  account  alone  accounted  for  roughly
    �64,000.   (It  would  appear  that  this  is  a  combination  of  bank
    statements showing a balance to the equivalent of �39,000 in a  savings
    account and the equivalent  of  some  �24,000  showing  self-employment
    income in a business account.)  The judge said that this did  not  take
    into account the income shown  in  the  accounts.   The  money  in  the
    business account did fluctuate but at the date of application the  bank
    statements showed that for  a  period  of  time  sufficient  funds  are
    available when combined with  the  savings  to  get  over  the  savings
    threshold.  The judge said she was entitled to take  into  account  any
    other credible and reliable source of income available at the  date  of
    application to the appellant and the sponsor.  There  was  income  from
    self-employment clearly available at the date of the application.   She
    found that the documents were credible and reliable.

7.   She concluded at the date of the  application  the  appellant  met  the
    requirements of the Rules.  Paragraph 21A of Appendix FM-SE  read  with
    GEN.3.2.  If the appellant were not granted entry his  British  citizen
    children and wife would not relocate to Nigeria.  The family  would  be
    permanently  separated.   There  would  be   an   unjustifiably   harsh
    consequence that would have a  continuing  devastating  impact  on  the
    appellant's children in particular.  The appellant  had  satisfied  her
    that he had a successful business in Nigeria and that he  would  likely
    continue with this or a similar business in the  United  Kingdom.   The
    judge concluded that the refusal to grant  entry  was  an  interference
    with the appellant's family life in the United Kingdom and that of  his
    partner and children that was disproportionate, having  regard  to  the
    public interest in immigration control  and  in  the  alternative  that
    there were exceptional  circumstances  rendering  refusal  of  leave  a
    breach of the family's Article 8 rights.  The consequences of a refusal
    of leave would cause very substantial  difficulties  and  unduly  harsh
    consequences when balanced against the strength of public  interest  in
    immigration control.

8.   The appeal having been allowed, the respondent sought and  was  granted
    permission to appeal on the basis that the judge was only  entitled  to
    take other sources of  income  into  account  where  there  were  truly
    exceptional circumstances, and no such  exceptional  circumstances  had
    been identified.  It was argued that the  decision  was  proportionate.
    In her submissions Ms Isherwood adopted and developed the  points  made
    in the grounds.  It was accepted that the appellant did  not  meet  the
    financial requirements via the required  evidence.   It  had  not  been
    explained why the appellant wanted to rely on  the  other  evidence  of
    self-employment and the judge had not  shown why  the  requirements  of
    the Rules could not be met as  self-employment  was  allowed.   In  the
    refusal letter it was accepted that there was �25,000 of income but the
    judge referred to more and ignored the accepted point  in  the  refusal
    letter.  There was little evidence provided.  It was  unclear  how  the
    judge had arrived at the figure of �64,000 equivalent, at paragraph  20
    of the decision.  Article 8 did not exist to enable a person  to  chose
    where they wanted to spend their family life.  It had to be  compelling
    and that was not the case  here.   The  evidence  with  regard  to  the
    children did not make out the necessary exceptional circumstances.  The
    fact that the sponsor  would  not  go  back  to  Nigeria,  having  been
    naturalised, was a matter of choice just as had been  made  some  years
    earlier.  The decision lacked reasoning.

9.   In his submissions Mr Nwaekwu argued that  the  judge  had  provided  a
    reasoned decision especially at paragraph 19 and paragraph 20 and  made
    adequate findings about exceptional circumstances which had been  found
    to exist and this was on the basis of hearing the oral evidence of  the
    appellant and the sponsor.  The judge had reached findings  on  GEN.3.2
    and the fact that paragraph 21A requirements were met.  It was found at
    paragraph 20 that the appellant met the requirements of  the  Rules  at
    the date of the application.  The respondent did not properly  consider
    paragraph 21A and hence the judge  had  done  so  and  found  that  the
    requirements were met.  The challenge sought to relitigate  or  reargue
    the case.   The  findings  on  proportionality  were  adequate  as  the
    decision was to be read as a whole.  The  judge  had  heard  sufficient
    oral evidence about the children and the circumstances when  they  were
    separated from their father at a time when they  needed  him  in  their
    lives.  Exceptional circumstances had been found to exist and it was  a
    reasoned decision and there was no error of law.

10.  Ms Isherwood had no points to make by way of reply.

Discussion

11.  The application was refused on the basis that the appellant  could  not
    meet the financial requirements under EC-ECP.3.1 to 3.4 as there was no
    evidence that his wife and the sponsor had income of  �18,600  a  year,
    and the self-employment documentation did not meet the Rules in respect
    of cash savings that there had been a failure to  provide  evidence  of
    savings held for at least six months of at least �62,500.

12.  The judge at paragraph 10 of her decision noted that  it  was  accepted
    by the appellant that he had not submitted documents that satisfied the
    main requirements of the Rules.  She allowed the appeal however on  the
    basis that under paragraph 21A of Appendix FM-SE  it  was  possible  to
    take into account any other credible and reliable source of  income  or
    funds for the applicant or their partner, which is available  to   them
    at the date of application or  which  will  become  available  to  them
    during the period of limited leave applied  for  and  in  circumstances
    where at GEN.3.2 there would be unjustifiably harsh consequences.

13.  The difficulty as I see it with the judge's decision, is that when  she
    was considering the evidence, she said no more, at paragraph  19,  with
    regard to the children that they are British citizens  and  have  spent
    their whole life in the United Kingdom, had been to Nigeria  on  a  few
    occasions for short visits and that given  their  life  in  the  United
    Kingdom on which she said she  heard  evidence  regarding  friends  and
    schooling,  that requiring them to  relocate  permanently  to  Nigeria,
    where they had never lived. would not promote their welfare  or  be  in
    their best interests and would be disproportionate.

14.  That however in my view falls short of enabling a proper finding to  be
    made that the consequences would be unjustifiably harsh.  In effect the
    judge described no more than the ongoing circumstances  of  the  family
    separation, and referred to no evidence which showed that  there  would
    be a continuing devastating impact on the children  in  particular,  to
    which she referred at paragraph 22 of her decision.   In  my  view  the
    challenge to the decision goes  well  beyond  simple  disagreement  and
    points to a failure adequately to consider, still less set out  in  any
    detail what  the  evidence  was,  that  could  be  said  to  amount  to
    unjustifiably harsh consequences which is  the  test  required  in  the
    Immigration Rules.

15.  Since the judge also  in  essence  based  her  decision  on  Article  8
    outside the Rules on those same  circumstances,  I  consider  that  her
    decision is equally flawed in that regard.  Accordingly the appeal will
    require to be reheard and in my view will require a  rehearing  to  the
    extent that it can only properly be done by the matter  being  remitted
    for a full rehearing in the First-tier Tribunal at Newport by  a  judge
    other than Judge Heaven.

No anonymity direction is made.
