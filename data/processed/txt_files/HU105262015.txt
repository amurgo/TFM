Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Quee, Solicitor from Quee and Mayanja Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is a challenge by the Appellant against the decision of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge S Rodger (the judge), promulgated on  25  May  2017,  in
    which he dismissed her appeal against the Respondent's  decision  of  9
    October 2015.  The Appellant had sought entry  clearance  to  join  her
    spouse (the sponsor)  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The  Entry  Clearance
    Officer had refused that application on two  grounds:  first  that  the
    Appellant's  relationship  with  her  husband  was  not   genuine   and
    subsisting; second, that the English language requirement had not  been
    met.  The application had been considered  under  Appendix  FM  to  the
    Immigration Rules.




The judge's decision

 2. The judge found the sponsor to be a credible witness  and  went  on  to
    conclude that the relationship  was  in  fact  genuine  and  subsisting
    (paragraphs 25 to 26).  In respect of the English language requirement,
    the judge noted the existence of a NARIC letter but found that this did
    not satisfy the specific evidential requirements under  Appendix  FM-SE
    to the Rules.  Having regard to the evidence as a whole the judge found
    that the Appellant was able to speak sufficiently good English  suffice
    to be able to integrate into the United  Kingdom,  that  she  would  be
    maintained according to the minimum income threshold  set  out  in  the
    Rules, and  that  if  she  were  to  make  a  further  entry  clearance
    application this would have been, "likely to succeed"  (paragraphs  28,
    30, and 33).

 3.  Ultimately,  the  judge  found  that  the  inability  to  satisfy  the
    particular requirements of the Rules in relation  to  English  language
    evidence was, in what he described as the absence of  any  "exceptional
    or compelling" factors, decisive of the appeal.




The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 4. The somewhat lengthy grounds of  appeal  essentially  assert  that  the
    evidence before the judge  did  in  fact  satisfy  Appendix  FM-SE,  or
    alternatively that the judge applied  an  exceptionality  test  in  the
    context of the Article 8 claim outside the context of the Rules.

 5. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Canavan on  13
    September 2017.




Thee hearing before us

 6. At the outset of the hearing Mr Clarke  accepted  that  the  judge  had
    materially erred in law.  He pointed out that the  judge  had  accepted
    that the English language requirement was, in  substance,  met  by  the
    Appellant.  Mr  Clarke  acknowledged  that  the  judge  had  in  effect
    accepted that as at the date of the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing  the
    various requirements of the Rules had been met.  Mr Clarke acknowledged
    that as of the date of the hearing before us the Appellant continued to
    meet the requirements of the Rules. That being the  case,  he  accepted
    that there were no public interest considerations which could  outweigh
    the factors in favour of the Appellant.  He  indicated  that  we  could
    quite properly set aside the judge's decision and remake that  decision
    by allowing the Appellant's appeal outright on Article 8 grounds  (this
    being a human rights only appeal).

 7. Unsurprisingly Mr Quee did not seek to  suggest  any  other  course  of
    action.




Decision on error of law

 8. We find that Mr Clarke's express concession in this case  was  properly
    made and in consequence, we conclude that the judge did materially  err
    in law.

 9. We set aside the decision.




Re-making the decision

10. Having set aside the judge's decision we now  remake  the  decision  in
    light of the evidence as a whole and the position adopted by Mr Clarke,
    above.  We find, as did the judge, that  the  Appellant's  relationship
    with  her  husband  is  and  has  always  been  perfectly  genuine  and
    subsisting.

11. There has never been any dispute  as  to  the  Appellant's  ability  to
    satisfy the financial requirements under  Appendix  FM.  We  find  that
    these have been met.

12. As to the English language requirements, we do not seek  to  go  behind
    the concession by Mr Clarke before us that  the  relevant  requirements
    were met by the Appellant as at the date of hearing  before  the  judge
    and as of today.  Not only was there the NARIC  letter,  but  also  the
    original degree certificate.

13. There were, and are, no other issues in dispute  relating  to  Appendix
    FM.

14. Thus, the requirements of the Rules had been met and there  is  nothing
    else the Appellant need show in order to succeed in his appeal.

15. We allow the appeal on the basis that the requirements of  Appendix  FM
    have been met in full.

16. If it were said,  notwithstanding  Mr  Clarke's  concession,  that  the
    particular requirements under Appendix FM-SE were not met in respect of
    the English language evidence, we would nonetheless conclude that  this
    appeal should be allowed on Article 8 grounds outside  the  context  of
    the Rules. As a matter of fact the Appellant speaks  sufficiently  good
    English so as to be able to integrate fully into life in this  country,
    and all other aspects of the Rules are met.  Even taking account of the
    hypothetical fact that the particular requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE
    had not been met in respect of the English language issue, this  factor
    alone would  not,  even  when  incorporated  into  the  general  public
    interest factor, be sufficient  to  render  the  Respondent's  decision
    proportionate.

17. Therefore we would allow the appeal on this alternative basis.




Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material errors of law.

We set that decision aside.

We re-make the decision by allowing the  Appellant's  appeal  on  Article  8
grounds.



No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award of ï¿½140.00. The Appellant has succeeded in her appeal on the basis  of
evidence submitted in advance of the First-tier Tribunal  hearing,  and  the
Respondent has conceded that she should have been successful at  that  stage
at the latest.
