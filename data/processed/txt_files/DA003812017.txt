For the Appellant:     Mr A. McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    -


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of Poland born on the 9th  February  1997.
    His case comes before the Upper Tribunal because the Secretary of State
    wishes to deport him, pursuant to  Regulation  27  of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.

 2. My task in this decision is to determine whether the Secretary of State
    has made out his case for expulsion. Before I make my decision, and set
    out the reasons for it, it is appropriate that I set out the history of
    this matter so far.




    Case History

 3. Mr Drozd has, it is now established, lived in the United Kingdom  since
    he was eight years old, having arrived in the care of  his  mother.  He
    has lived here, with his mother, siblings and latterly stepfather, ever
    since.

 4. He has been in trouble with the law on a number of occasions. In August
    2011, when he was 14, he was cautioned for theft. In 2015 he received a
    conditional discharge upon conviction for criminal damage and  battery.
    In February 2016 his criminality took a  more  serious  turn,  when  he
    received a sentence of 24 months in a Young Offenders  Institution  for
    his part in a drunken group assault on a man who was robbed and  kicked
    to the ground. In May of that year he received  a  further  consecutive
    sentence for burglary. This is a sorry record given that  Mr  Drozd  is
    still only 22 years old.

 5. It was this string of convictions which led the Secretary of State,  in
    June 2017, to the decision to deport him.

 6. Mr Drozd appealed against that decision. On the 30th  August  2017  the
    matter came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Thorne.  By  his  written
    decision dated the 20th September 2017 Judge Thorne found as fact  that
    Mr Drozd has lived in this country since he was 8 years old,  and  that
    he attended primary and  secondary  school  here.  Although  there  was
    limited documentary evidence to establish such  long  residence,  there
    was a letter from his primary school and Judge  Thorne  noted  that  Mr
    Drozd speaks "English like a native with  a  strong  regional  accent".
    Judge Thorne was further satisfied that by the time that Mr  Drozd  was
    sent to prison, he had been living here for 10 years. He found that  by
    virtue of Regulation 27(4) this meant that the Secretary of  State  had
    to demonstrate that there were "imperative grounds" before he could  be
    deported. This he could not do, and the appeal was allowed.

 7. The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal. The grounds took
    issue with the factual finding that Mr Drozd had  acquired  ten  years'
    residence. In particular it was alleged that Judge Thorne  should  have
    calculated backward from the date that he was sent  to  prison  on  the
    15th February 2016. Since the letter from  the  primary  school  stated
    that he had enrolled in November 2006, the Secretary of  State  refused
    to accept that the full 10 years had been proven. By his  calculations,
    Mr Drozd was short by 8  months.   Reliance  was  placed  on  Onuekwere
    [2013] EUCJC C-378/12, with  the  submission  made  that  Judge  Thorne
    failed to consider whether Mr Drozd was in fact integrated. The grounds
    then say this:

         "The omission of such consideration of the Appellant's  conduct  in
         the 10 year period prior to conviction is a fundamental error,  and
         the FTTJ should have considered the appeal on the  basis  that  the
         Appellant only had a permanent right of residency.  If  the  appeal
         had been considered on that basis it is respectfully submitted that
         the FTTJ was bound to dismiss the appeal".

 8. Permission was granted on those grounds, and  the  matter  came  before
    Upper Tribunal Judge Plimmer.  By her decision of the 5th February 2018
    Judge Plimmer found the decision of Judge Thorne to be flawed for error
    of law.  Whilst the Secretary of  State  had  not  actually  identified
    this, the correct position in law was that the 10 year period had to be
    calculated by counting backwards from  the  date  of  the  decision  to
    deport: see Regulation 27(4)(a).  This Judge Thorne had not  done.  Nor
    had he investigated whether the prison term had undermined any level of
    integration that Mr Drozd may have achieved. Further Judge Plimmer  had
    regard to what was then simply an Attorney-General's opinion in  Vomero
    C-424/16, to the effect that the acquisition of permanent residence  is
    a pre-requisite to achieving the '10  year'  enhanced  protection.  She
    remitted the matter to Judge Thorne, preserving his other  findings  of
    fact and requiring him to make a fresh decision  applying  the  correct
    legal framework.

 9. Thus the matter came back before Judge Thorne.   Having had  regard  to
    Judge Plimmer's decision, Judge Thorne found, in a detailed and  cogent
    determination dated the 21st June 2019, as follows:

           . That the family entered the United Kingdom on the 7th February
             2006

           . The decision to deport was made on the 28th June 2017

           . Counting backwards from the date of the  deportation  decision
             Mr Drozd had therefore lived in the United  Kingdom  for  over
             ten years

           . Mr Drozd had however been sent to prison on the 24th May 2016,
             so his period of residence had been interrupted by a period in
             detention

           . In the decision of the Grand Chamber in Vomero[1] the CJEU had
             held that imprisonment can cast doubt on integrative links but
             periods in jail should not automatically be excluded from  the
             calculation

           . On the facts, that period of detention did  not  interrupt  or
             undermine Mr Drozd's  degree  of  integration  in  the  United
             Kingdom. He has lived  here  since  he  was  a  child,  speaks
             English like a native and has little or no memory of  life  in
             Poland, where he retains no substantive connection.  Mr  Drozd
             engaged  well  with  prison  staff  and   the   rehabilitative
             programme. He has established strong  integrative  links  with
             British society

           . He has therefore maintained his 10 year  continuous  residence
             and it is for the Secretary of State to show  that  there  are
             imperative grounds for his deportation

           . This he cannot do so the appeal must be allowed.

10. Despite directing himself to the decision in  Vomero  to  this  effect,
    Judge Thorne made no explicit finding on whether, during that ten  year
    period, Mr Drozd had acquired  permanent  residence,  that  is  to  say
    whether Mr Drozd had spent a continuous five year period  'living  here
    in accordance with the Regulations'.   There appears to be good  reason
    for that omission. I have read the record  of  proceedings  and  it  is
    clear that Ms Molomo, who appeared on behalf of the Secretary of State,
    made no submissions on the point. Further it seemed, from the Secretary
    of State's previous grounds to the Upper Tribunal, that the matter  was
    regarded as settled (see my ï¿½7 above):

         "the FTTJ should have considered the appeal on the basis  that  the
         Appellant only had a permanent right of residency".

11. Judge Thorne will no doubt therefore be extremely  surprised  to  learn
    that  the  Secretary  of  State  subsequently  sought,  and   obtained,
    permission to appeal against his decision  on  this  very  point.   The
    single ground in this second appeal to the Upper Tribunal wass that  it
    was not open to Judge Thorne to assume  that  permanent  residency  was
    acquired when Mr Drozd was a  school  student,  because  there  was  no
    evidence before him  to  show  that  he  had  taken  out  comprehensive
    sickness insurance.

12. By Regulation 4(1)(d)(ii) & (iii) a 'student' is defined  as  a  person
    who:

         (d)      "student" means a person who-

             (i) is enrolled, for the principal purpose of following a
             course of study (including vocational training), at a public
             or private establishment which is-

                  (aa) financed from public funds; or

                  (bb) otherwise recognised by the Secretary of State as an
                  establishment which has been accredited for the purpose of
                  providing such courses or training within the law or
                  administrative practice of the part of the United Kingdom
                  in which the establishment is located;

             (ii)      has comprehensive sickness insurance cover in the
             United Kingdom; and

             (iii)     has assured the Secretary of State, by means of a
             declaration, or by such equivalent means as the person may
             choose, that the person has sufficient resources not to become
             a burden on the social assistance system of the United Kingdom
             during the person's intended period of residence.

13. At a hearing before me in June Mr Drozd readily admitted  that  he  had
    never heard  of  comprehensive  sickness  insurance.  Mr  McVeety,  who
    appeared for the Secretary of State, was able to  tell  from  the  Home
    Office records that Mr Drozd had not been issued  with  a  registration
    certificate prior to 2011 which would exempt  him  from  the  insurance
    requirement[2]. Nor was there any indication that a declaration of self-
    sufficiency had been made.  It  would  therefore  follow  that  on  the
    evidence, Mr Drozd could not have qualified for permanent residence  as
    'qualified person' in his own right as a school student.

14. Applying Vomero, I was bound to find an error of  law.  In  my  written
    decision of the 21st June 2017 I said this:

         "As I think I have made plain, the Secretary of State's conduct  in
         this matter has been less than satisfactory. At no time  in  either
         of the appeals before Judge Thorne has the issue  of  comprehensive
         sickness insurance been raised. Nor, as far as I can  see,  was  it
         raised before Judge Plimmer.  In his second decision  Judge  Thorne
         was quite entitled to proceed on the basis that it was agreed  that
         Mr Drozd had acquired permanent residence, since that was the basis
         upon which the Secretary of State had hitherto put his case.   That
         said, it is clear from Regulation 4, and Mr Drozd's  own  evidence,
         that he could not have acquired a permanent right of residence as a
         student.  It would follow, applying Vomero, that he could  not,  on
         that basis at least, claim to have acquired the highest  '10  year'
         level of protection against expulsion".

15. Having found error, I was not however prepared  to  simply  remake  the
    decision. That is because it was acknowledged by the Secretary of State
    that the error would be entirely immaterial if Mr  Drozd  had  in  fact
    acquired permanent residence in another capacity, i.e.  as  the  family
    member of his mother, an EEA national exercising  treaty  rights.   The
    Secretary of State accepted that  it  would  be  in  the  interests  of
    justice to adjourn to give Mr Drozd the opportunity to demonstrate that
    his  mother  (or  stepfather)  had  been  economically  active  for   a
    continuous five year period during  his  minority.   I  adjourned  with
    directions for such evidence to be produced.

16. Unfortunately for Mr Drozd, it wasn't. Mr Drozd managed to  obtain  the
    HMRC records relating to his mother's work in the United Kingdom. These
    demonstrated that she has been continuously working since 2014 to date,
    but in the years preceding that  her  declared  income  was  zero.  The
    decision to deport was taken on the 28th June 2017. It followed that Mr
    Drozd could not demonstrate that he had acquired permanent residence as
    the family member of a qualified person; nor could be then rely on  his
    ten years+ long residence to  claim  any  enhanced  protection  against
    expulsion.  It is on that basis then, that  I  proceed  to  remake  the
    decision in this appeal.







    The Re-Made Decision

    The Legal Framework

17. The Secretary of State seeks to deport Mr Drozd  under  the  powers  in
    Regulation 27:

         '27.-    (1)  In this regulation, a "relevant decision" means an
             EEA decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public
             security or public health.

             (2) A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic
             ends.

             (3) A relevant decision may not be taken in respect of a
             person with a right of permanent residence under regulation 15
             except on serious grounds of public policy and public
             security.

             (4) A relevant decision may not be taken except on imperative
             grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-

                  (a)  has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous
                  period of at least ten years prior to the relevant
                  decision; or

                  (b)  is under the age of 18, unless the relevant decision
                  is in the best interests of the person concerned, as
                  provided for in the Convention on the Rights of the Child
                  adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on
                  20th November 1989.

             (5) The public policy and public security requirements of the
             United Kingdom include restricting rights otherwise conferred
             by these Regulations in order to protect the fundamental
             interests of society, and where a relevant decision is taken
             on grounds of public policy or public security it must also be
             taken in accordance with the following principles-

                  (a)  the decision must comply with the principle of
                  proportionality;

                  (b)  the decision must be based exclusively on the
                  personal conduct of the person concerned;

                  (c)  the personal conduct of the person must represent a
                  genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting
                  one of the fundamental interests of society, taking into
                  account past conduct of the person and that the threat
                  does not need to be imminent;

                  (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of the case or
                  which relate to considerations of general prevention do
                  not justify the decision;

                  (e)  a person's previous criminal convictions do not in
                  themselves justify the decision;

                  (f)  the decision may be taken on preventative grounds,
                  even in the absence of a previous criminal conviction,
                  provided the grounds are specific to the person.

             (6) Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds of public
             policy and public security in relation to a person ("P") who
             is resident in the United Kingdom, the decision maker must
             take account of considerations such as the age, state of
             health, family and economic situation of P, P's length of
             residence in the United Kingdom, P's social and cultural
             integration into the United Kingdom and the extent of P's
             links with P's country of origin.

             (7) In the case of a relevant decision taken on grounds of
             public health-

                  (a)  a disease that does not have epidemic potential as
                  defined by the relevant instruments of the World Health
                  Organisation or is not a disease listed in Schedule 1 to
                  the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010; or

                  (b)  if the person concerned is in the United Kingdom, any
                  disease occurring after the three month period beginning
                  on the date on which the person arrived in the United
                  Kingdom,

             does not constitute grounds for the decision.

             (8) A court or tribunal considering whether the requirements
             of this regulation are met must (in particular) have regard to
             the considerations contained in Schedule 1 (considerations of
             public policy, public security and the fundamental interests
             of society etc.).'

18. The relevant part of Schedule 1 is paragraph 7:

         '7.      For the purposes of these Regulations, the fundamental
         interests of society in the United Kingdom include-

             (a) preventing unlawful immigration and abuse of the
             immigration laws, and maintaining the integrity and
             effectiveness of the immigration control system (including
             under these Regulations) and of the Common Travel Area;

             (b) maintaining public order;

             (c) preventing social harm;

             (d) preventing the evasion of taxes and duties;

             (e) protecting public services;

             (f) excluding or removing an EEA national or family member of
             an EEA national with a conviction (including where the conduct
             of that person is likely to cause, or has in fact caused,
             public offence) and maintaining public confidence in the
             ability of the relevant authorities to take such action;

             (g) tackling offences likely to cause harm to society where an
             immediate or direct victim may be difficult to identify but
             where there is wider societal harm (such as offences related
             to the misuse of drugs or crime with a cross-border dimension
             as mentioned in Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning
             of the European Union);

             (h) combating the effects of persistent offending
             (particularly in relation to offences, which if taken in
             isolation, may otherwise be unlikely to meet the requirements
             of regulation 27);

             (i)       protecting the rights and freedoms of others,
             particularly from exploitation and trafficking;

             (j) protecting the public;

             (k) acting in the best interests of a child (including where
             doing so entails refusing a child admission to the United
             Kingdom, or otherwise taking an EEA decision against a child);

             (l) countering terrorism and extremism and protecting shared
             values.

    The Evidence

19. The bare facts relied upon by the Secretary of State are set out at  my
    paragraph 4 above.  In his submissions Mc McVeety  indicated  that  the
    Secretary of State did not ask me to place any  significant  weight  on
    either the 2011 caution or the  2015  conditional  discharge,  both  of
    which arose from offences committed when Mr Drozd was  a  minor.    The
    offences giving rise to the decision to deport were those for which  Mr
    Drozd was convicted in May 2016.  These were the robbery, burglary  and
    assault, for which Mr Drozd received a sentence of 24 months concurrent
    in a Young Offenders Institution (at the date of conviction he was  19;
    he was 18 at the date of the offence).    I have been provided  with  a
    copy of the sentencing remarks of HHJ Badley.  As  these  remarks  make
    clear, the central offences of the robbery and  assault  arose  from  a
    particularly nasty incident when Mr Drozd was drunk and apparently  out
    of control:

         "The circumstances of that robbery were that you Brajan Drozd,  for
         reasons of becoming embroiled in alcohol use, you and the young man
         that you were with took exception to [the first victim]; whether in
         fact there was some name calling between you  really  doesn't  bear
         delving into, because you had taken alcohol.  The other  young  man
         who was the victim had also taken alcohol and it was a  potent  mix
         of young people not able to handle the alcohol, finding slights and
         moving on from there towards offending.

         The situation became ugly; I note that Jake Manning, the  companion
         that you at the time had with you, punched Mr Brown and started  it
         off. Thereafter you joined in. [The victim] went to the ground. You
         punched [the second victim]. He tried to get away and noticed  that
         you were hitting [the first victim] as he was  on  the  ground  and
         also going through his clothing as he lay unconscious stealing from
         him".

20. In June 2017, just over a year into  sentence,  the  Probation  Service
    prepared a report on Mr Drozd.  This gives  further  background  detail
    about the circumstances of the offence. Mr Drozd and  two  friends  had
    already consumed a bottle of vodka when they went into  Blackburn  town
    centre on a Saturday night. They were refused entry to  a  bar  because
    they were inappropriately dressed. They hung around  outside.  The  two
    victims came out of that bar and words were exchanged between  the  two
    groups. From there it escalated in the manner described by HHJ  Badley.
    At that time the probation service assessed Mr Drozd as  having  a  20%
    chance of reoffending within one year of discharge, and a 33% chance of
    reoffending within a two year period; this was classed  as  a  'medium'
    risk.  The information used by the  officer  to  make  that  assessment
    included the offences itself, the motivation  and  circumstances  (i.e.
    the drinking and peer group) and the attitude  displayed  by  Mr  Drozd
    post-conviction.

21. In respect of that attitude Mr McVeety  asked  me  to  give  particular
    weight to the attempts by Mr Drozd to minimise the seriousness of  that
    offence.  In the OASys report the probation officer made the  following
    notes:

         "Initially  he  attempted  to  minimise  the  offences  but   after
         discussion pleaded guilty to the offences. He did  state  that  the
         victim deserved what he got but later  retracted  this  and  stated
         that he did not deserve to be assaulted and  expressed  regret  for
         his actions although the victim should not have threatened him  and
         his friends"

    Having drawn my attention to that passage Mr  McVeety  further  pointed
    out that Mr Drozd  had  interrupted  Mr  McVeety's  submission  on  the
    offence by saying "it wasn't as bad as its being made out". As  I  made
    clear to Mr Drozd at the hearing, attacking a man who is unconscious is
    an extremely serious assault and it was  not  to  his  credit  that  he
    attempted to minimise the severity of that assault. In fairness  to  Mr
    Drozd I do however acknowledge that at the hearing both myself  and  Mr
    McVeety were proceeding on the basis that this had been a group assault
    on a single victim: this does appear to have  been  at  odds  with  the
    evidence I refer to above, which suggests that it was in fact a dispute
    between two groups.

22. There was some evidence of remorse and rehabilitation.  The  author  of
    the June 2017 OASys report records Mr Drozd as  having  reflected  that
    the victim could have been him or his brother, and that the man did not
    deserve what happened to him. He felt  really  bad  about  the  assault
    then, and had developed insight into his violent offending, recognising
    that it was fuelled by  cannabis,  excessive  alcohol  consumption  and
    "going  along"  with  friends.  Mr  Drozd  and  the  probation  service
    consistently report that he has not drunk to excess since  his  offence
    was committed. Mr Drozd told me that since his release from  prison  he
    has not touched cannabis.  He  has  had  vodka  on  one  occasion,  and
    sometimes had a beer watching sport with his stepfather.  He  does  not
    get drunk anymore.  Since the day of the offence he has  not  seen  the
    friends he was with that day.  One of  them  had  been  a  particularly
    close friend and Mr Drozd regrets that they are no longer  in  contact,
    but recognizes that it is not in his interest to renew that friendship.
     The Secretary of State accepts that Mr Drozd  has  complied  with  the
    terms of his licence, apart from one recent occasion where Mr Drozd was
    found to be in Blackburn town centre in contravention of a curfew (both
    Mr Drozd and Mr McVeety were uncertain about  who  might  have  imposed
    such a 'curfew' or what the terms of it might be).

23. Mr Drozd has attended all of his fortnightly probation service meetings
    and has committed no further offences.  In  a  letter  dated  the  14th
    December 2018 Mrs Toni Routh, an offender manager, wrote  of  Mr  Drozd
    that he had engaged  well  with  the  prison  regime.  He  demonstrated
    positive behaviour throughout his programme and feedback from programme
    facilitators about him was very  positive.  Prison  staff  reported  no
    adjudications and said that he was polite and well-mannered.  Mrs Routh
    found Mr Drozd to be very open and honest  during  the  year  that  she
    spent working with him.  He  demonstrated  good  reflection  about  his
    offence, especially in relation to the victim and the consequences  for
    society generally.

24. As to his personal circumstances Mr Drozd confirmed  that  he  is  back
    living with his mother and stepmother (he had initially  been  released
    on  licence  to  his  sister's  address).  His  mother  had  -  perhaps
    understandably - been furious with him about the conviction but now she
    was supporting him. His mother has submitted a signed witness statement
    in which she explains that Mr Drozd  had  a  difficult  childhood.  His
    father was abusive and she left him when Mr Drozd was only a baby.  She
    had struggled as a single mother to provide  for  her  three  children.
    When they moved to the United Kingdom in 2006 Mr Drozd had struggled at
    school but now he spoke more English than he does Polish.  In  2012  he
    had been attacked by an unknown assailant - his jaw  had  been  broken.
    She believes that this  led  to  her  son  being  anxious  and  seeking
    reassurance from being in a group  of  friends.  That  he  was  "easily
    influenced" by this group led him to substance abuse  and  to  breaking
    the law.  She believes that now her son has changed. She has remarried,
    and he has a strong relationship with her new husband. The family  have
    had no problems with Mr Drozd since he was released  from  prison.  She
    and his stepfather engage with him frequently about his life  and  past
    offending and are confident that they can keep him on the  right  path.
    The whole family life here apart from Mr Drozd's maternal  grandmother,
    who remains in her village in Poland. His mother visits  her  at  least
    every year; his sister has also been back to Poland to see her  but  he
    himself has not been back to Poland since he was in the early years  of
    secondary school.

25. Mr Drozd told me, and I have no reason  to  doubt,  that  he  has  been
    employed full time since his release  from  prison  last  year.  He  is
    employed by a car valet company in Blackburn and he  earns  about  ï¿½300
    per week. He works 9-6 every day, 5 days  per  week.  His  employer  is
    aware that he was in prison and  gives  him  time  off  to  attend  his
    probation meetings - he lets him go early those days.   Mr  Drozd  says
    that he gives his mother some money towards bills and housekeeping, and
    he is trying to save the rest to set up his own car valet business.




    My Findings

26. Having regard to the factors set out at  Regulation  27(5)  I  find  as
    follows.

27. The Secretary of State seeks by her decision  to  protect  one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society, namely  protecting  the  public  from
    violent crime.   I find that the decision to deport arises  exclusively
    from the conduct of Mr Drozd.

28. I am not satisfied, that as of todays date, Mr Drozd does  represent  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society.

29. Although I have had, at  the  forefront  of  my  mind,  that  Mr  Drozd
    exhibited  a  horrible  and  frightening  propensity  to  use  violence
    exemplified in that assault in 2015, I am satisfied on balance that  he
    has taken meaningful steps to address that issue.  Although it is  true
    that he has not been able to complete any 'thinking skills' courses  in
    custody (these were not made available to him) these are not  the  only
    ways in which a prisoner can demonstrate rehabilitation.

30.  I am satisfied that the risk of reoffending today is low.  I  so  find
    for the following reasons. First, Mr Drozd  has  committed  no  further
    offences since November 2015. Although I accept that  he  has  been  in
    custody and/or licence for much of that time, it is of course the  case
    the people can  continue  to  offend  even  in  those  circumstances  -
    particularly hot-headed young men prone to  fighting.  It  is  in  that
    regard of note that Mr Drozd had an impeccable record  as  a  prisoner.
    Second, he has complied well with the terms of his  licence,  attending
    all of his appointments with his probation officer save two, which were
    authorised absences. Third, he  has  satisfied  me  (and  indeed  Judge
    Thorne) that he is truly remorseful for his actions, and  that  he  has
    taken personal action to prevent himself getting into trouble again: he
    has stopped smoking cannabis, he has cut off the friends  that  he  was
    with that night and he has markedly reduced his alcohol intake  to  the
    extent that he now drinks only socially and very occasionally. He  has,
    in short, grown up. Fourth, he  has  demonstrated  his  intentions  and
    attitude by working full time.

31. I have had the opportunity to hear directly  from  Mr  Drozd  over  the
    course of two hearings. Like Judge Thorne I am entirely satisfied  that
    his imprisonment notwithstanding, Mr Drozd is integrated  into  British
    society.  Although he does speak Polish, and does not shy away from his
    nationality, that heritage would not be readily apparent  to  a  casual
    observer. As Judge Thorne found, he  speaks  with  a  "strong  regional
    accent"; everything he has known since he was a young  child  -  music,
    football, friends, surroundings - has  been  English.   He  has  strong
    links with this country in terms of his immediate family - his  sister,
    brother and their  families,  his  mother  and  stepfather  -  are  all
    resident here and have been for many years.  Conversely his links  with
    Poland are minimal. He has spent no more than a week  in  that  country
    since he left aged 8, and has little contact with his  grandmother  who
    remains there.  Having considered all of those matters, and having  had
    particular regard to the offences committed, I am  satisfied  that  his
    deportation,  away  from  everything  he  knows,   would   not   be   a
    proportionate response to a series of offences committed as a youth.

32. It follows that the appeal must be allowed.




    Decisions

33. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

34. The decision in the appeal is remade as follows: "the appeal is allowed
    under the Regulations".

35. I make no order for anonymity.
