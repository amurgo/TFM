Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Greer, instructed by Legal Justice Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal
    or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any
    form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly  identify  the
    appellant in  this  determination  identified  as  MS.  This  direction
    applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any  failure  to  comply  with
    this direction could give rise to contempt of court proceedings

      1. The appellant, an Afghan citizen, arrived in the UK  on  5th  March
         2014 and claimed asylum with his wife and child  (a  girl  born  in
         2009) as dependants. Whilst in the UK they had a son in 2015 who is
         also a dependant on her father's asylum  application.   The  asylum
         application  was  refused,  and  the  appeal   dismissed.   Further
         submissions  were  made,  and  a  further  decision  taken  by  the
         respondent to refuse their protection and human rights claims.

      2. The appeal came before First-tier Tribunal judge Cruthers  on  17th
         July 2018 and for reasons set out in a decision promulgated on 18th
         October 2018, the First-tier Tribunal Judge dismissed the appeal on
         protection grounds and allowed the appeal on Article 8 human rights
         grounds. The appellant sought and was granted permission to  appeal
         the dismissal of the protection claim; there was  no  cross  appeal
         against the Article 8/ human rights decision.

      3. The grounds  of  appeal  are,  put  briefly,  that  the  First-tier
         Tribunal judge failed to reach a decision on whether the fact  that
         the appellant's wife and daughter would be confined to  their  home
         in order to avoid harassment and that the inability of the children
         to obtain education amounted to persecution.

         Error of law

      4.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  found  that  the  basis  of  the
         appellant's account lacked credibility; that  his  account  of  how
         they had lived in Afghanistan was not credible and he gave detailed
         reasons for  rejecting  witness  evidence.  This  appeal  does  not
         however turn on those elements of the claim; this appeal  turns  on
         what the position would be on return to Afghanistan - a Sikh family
         consisting of an adult male, his wife and two children. The  eldest
         child has been attending school  in  the  UK  with,  for  the  last
         academic year an attendance rate of 96.77%. The youngest  child,  a
         boy,  is  attending  nursery  and  there  is  concern   about   his
         development in Prime  areas  of  communication  and  language.  The
         appellant's wife wishes to attend college but is unable  to  do  so
         because of lack of child care for their youngest child.

      5. The First-tier Tribunal judge found (ï¿½64 of his decision)

             "... it is my assessment that  that  test  ([very  significant
             obstacles under paragraph 276ADE Immigration Rules])  is  made
             out in the appellant's favour, (whether assessed by  reference
             to Jalalabad or Kabul) - for the following reasons:

                . One relatively consistent theme in  the  country  evidence
                  (and decided cases) is that for many years any Sikh  woman
                  who goes out  of  her  home  in  Afghanistan  will  almost
                  certainly be subjected to incidents of  harassment  (scarf
                  pulling and so on) by Muslim men. In  my  assessment  this
                  prevalent harassment means that the female members of  the
                  appellant's family would effectively be  confined  to  the
                  house if the family were  now  to  live  in  Jalalabad  or
                  Kabul. The fact that the female members of the appellant's
                  family  (in  particular)  would  be  subject  to  frequent
                  harassment and/ or severe restrictions back in Afghanistan
                  appears from (amongst other places) paragraphs 132 and 135
                  of TG.

                . Referring to pages 1 and 4 of  the  Gurudwara  Guru  Nanak
                  Darbar letter and TG, I do  not  find  that  the  risk  of
                  members of the appellants' family being kidnapped/  raped/
                  persecuted rises to the level of a  real  risk.  I  would,
                  however,  accept  that  the  members  of  the  appellant's
                  family,  particularly  the  female  members,  would   very
                  significantly restrict their ways of living  in  order  to
                  reduce the risk of them being kidnapped.

                . The appellant's children are unlikely  to  have  effective
                  access to  education  if  the  family  resumes  living  in
                  Afghanistan (see, for example, paragraph 50 of TG)

                .  If  the  family  resumed  living  in  Afghanistan   their
                  opportunities for meeting other Sikhs for the purposes  of
                  worship would be very curtailed (at best) ..."

      6.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  did  not  consider  whether  the
         significant restrictions on the appellant's wife and  daughter  and
         the significant restrictions on education of both children amounted
         to persecution. This failure amounts to an error of law  such  that
         the decision is set aside to be remade.

         Remaking the decision

      7. The issue to be remade is narrow. There  is  no  challenge  to  the
         credibility findings of the First-tier Tribunal judge; this  appeal
         turns simply on whether the  strong  findings  made  by  First-tier
         Tribunal judge in connection with confinement to the home  and  the
         lack of access to education is such as to amount to persecution.

      8. It is difficult to conclude  otherwise  than  that  for  women  and
         daughters to have to choose to remain confined  to  their  home  to
         avoid  harassment  and  to  reduce  the  risk  of   kidnapping   is
         persecution. The fact that there is a male  member  of  the  family
         does not prevent that confinement,

      9. Furthermore, it is difficult to conclude otherwise  than  that  the
         prevention  of  children  having  access  to   education   is   not
         persecution. In this case the youngest child has some special needs
         although he has not been formally statemented. Whether he grows out
         of this or not (as considered to be the  case  by  the  judge)  the
         restriction on education when this family  plainly  considers  that
         education is important and relevant to their development cannot  be
         otherwise than persecution.

     10. I find that the female members of the family and the youngest child
         would, on return to Afghanistan be at risk of being persecuted.  It
         follows that the appeal is allowed.




    Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

    I set aside the decision and  remake  the  appeal  by  allowing  it  on
    international protection grounds.




    Anonymity

    The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of  the
    Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

    I continue that order (pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
