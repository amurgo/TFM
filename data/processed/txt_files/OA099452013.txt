                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant in this appeal  was  the  Respondent  at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing on 10 April 2015. However, for ease of reference,  the
    Appellant and Respondent are hereafter referred to as they were  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.  Therefore Mrs Manota is referred  to  as  the
    Appellant and the Secretary of State is referred to as the Respondent.

 2. The Respondent was granted permission to appeal against the decision of
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Hunter  (the  Judge),  who  dismissed  the
    Appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules, because  the  Appellant
    could not meet the financial provisions of Appendix FM-SE  in  relation
    to the income of the Sponsor, and allowed it under Article  8  ECHR  on
    the basis that: (i)  the  Sponsor's  income  only  fell  short  of  the
    financial requirements by �250; (ii) on the  authority  of  MM  v  SSHD
    [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin), he found that refusal of the  application  on
    the basis of an inability to meet the financial  requirements  amounted
    to a disproportionate interference with the rights of British  national
    sponsors and refugees to enjoy respect for family life.

 3. In the  grounds  of  application,  it  is  submitted  that  the   Judge
    materially misdirected himself in law because:

          a. As stated in the grounds at paras 1  -  7,  9  -  11  and  13,
             Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) makes it clear that an Article
             8 assessment should  only  be  carried  out  where  compelling
             circumstances not covered by  the  Rules  are  established.  R
             (Nagre) v SSHD [2013] EWHC  720  (Admin)  provided  that  such
             compelling circumstances would  only  be  established  if  the
             refusal would lead to an unjustifiably  harsh  out  come.  The
             Judge  had  not  established  such  compelling  circumstances,
             thereby failing to apply the correct test, and had  failed  to
             provide reasons as to why it would be unjustifiably harsh  for
             the Appellant and the  Sponsor  to  continue  family  life  in
             Canada. It is  submitted  that  the  income  requirements  are
             within the Immigration Rules and there was no prejudice to the
             Appellant in the application of the law. It is submitted  that
             the Judge failed to make findings  on  whether  the  Appellant
             could have made a further application, so that any  separation
             was only temporary. There was no analysis by the Judge of  why
             the Appellant could not submit a further application.

          b. In MM v SSHD [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin), the Judge  usurped  the
             role of  the  democratically  elected  decision-maker  in  the
             formulation of policy and had insufficient regard to the width
             of  discretion  afforded  to  the  Secretary   of   State   in
             formulating policy. If he had applied the proper principles of
             proportionality,  he  would  have  been   compelled   to   the
             conclusion that the interference in the Article  8  rights  of
             applicants  and  their  families  caused   by   the   material
             provisions of the Immigration  Rules  was  proportionate.  The
             Judge thereby erred in relying on MM.

 4. The Upper Tribunal granted permission on the basis that "It  is  indeed
    arguable that the judge gave no reasons  for  why  he  considered  that
    there was an arguably good case for consideration outside the rules  on
    Article 8 grounds or why he found the circumstances warranted  a  grant
    of leave on that  basis.  It  is  also  arguable  that  when  assessing
    proportionality he failed to consider the fact that the appellant could
    make a fresh application for entry clearance if  her  sponsor's  income
    now met the maintenance requirements and to consider why  it  would  be
    disproportionate to expect her to do so. The requirements are in  place
    for a reason and arguably Article 8 cannot be used to circumvent them."

The hearing

 5. Mr Parminder Singh Jaghra, who attended the hearing, is the Sponsor and
    a lay representative. It was explained to him that the Judge had  found
    that his wife could not meet the provisions of  the  Immigration  Rules
    for a grant of  entry  clearance  as  his  spouse  and  the  Judge  had
    therefore allowed the appeal on Article 8 grounds, that the  Respondent
    had appealed against that decision on the  basis  that  the  Judge  had
    erred in the way in which the law was applied in reaching this decision
    and that permission had been granted by the Upper Tribunal  because  it
    appeared that the Judge had misapplied the law. When asked if he had  a
    copy of the grounds of application and the grant of permission, he said
    that he had not. Copies were supplied to him and he was given  time  to
    read them. The hearing proceeded when he confirmed  that  he  had  read
    those documents and that he was able to deal with the issues which were
    raised in them.

 6. Mr Mills provided a copy  of  SS  (Congo)  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387,  and
    referred to paragraphs 40 - 41, submitting that whilst in  the  grounds
    there was reference to the earlier case  of  Gulshan,  SS  (Congo)  had
    confirmed  that  where  an  appellant  could  not  succeed  under   the
    Immigration Rules, compelling circumstances  must  be  established  for
    allowing an appeal under a free standing Article 8 assessment which was
    unconstrained by the Immigration Rules. In the  Appellant's  case,  the
    Immigration Rules were not met and Article 8 was considered.  Mr  Mills
    submitted that firstly, the Judge erred in law in placing  reliance  on
    MM; the Court of Appeal had disagreed with the analysis of the Judge in
    MM in which he stated that the Rules and income  requirements  did  not
    strike a fair balance between British citizens and their  spouses.  The
    Court of Appeal found the opposite and  reliance  on  MM  rendered  the
    decision unsafe.

 7.  Mr  Mills  further  submitted  that  the  Judge  gave  absolutely   no
    consideration to the ability of the Appellant to re-apply;  she  was  a
    little short of meeting  the  income  threshold  and,  as  specifically
    provided in SS (Congo) it was fair and proportionate to refuse where it
    was being argued that the Appellant could not meet the requirements  at
    the date of decision but could now meet the requirements.  In  allowing
    the appeal under Article 8 because she was only a little short  of  the
    income threshold, the Judge used the near  miss  principle  and  in  SS
    (Congo), at paragraphs 54  -  56,  it  was  established  that  narrowly
    missing the threshold was not a determinative factor. He submitted that
    the decision was unsafe, that it should be set aside and that it should
    be remade on the basis of the evidence before me.

 8. The Sponsor submitted that he understood  that  the  Immigration  Rules
    were not met because his income was a little short of the threshold (he
    said that he was �200 short), but he submitted that he had money  in  a
    savings account and in shares and pension schemes,  and  that  he  also
    received about �600 per month in bonuses, although this  had  not  been
    explained to the Judge, who made the decision on the evidence that  was
    available to him. The Sponsor  submitted  that  he  thought  that  this
    additional income could be taken into account and his income would then
    be over the threshold and that is why he had appealed on  Human  Rights
    grounds. He stated that he and his wife had previously been married and
    had got divorced because of the distance between them but  had  decided
    to remarry and to re-apply would mean that the separation  between  him
    and his wife would be prolonged. He  stated  that  the  separation  had
    caused a strain on the relationship between him and his wife, that they
    had waited two years for a decision, and that they were both  32  years
    of age and they needed to consider their future. H also stated that  he
    lived with his mother at present, that she was 61 years of age and  was
    under the care of the hospital, and that if his wife came to the UK his
    mother could retire.

 9. Mr Mills made no further submissions by way of reply and  both  he  and
    the Sponsor accepted that if I found  that  the  Judge  had  materially
    erred in law in reaching his decision, I would remake the  decision  on
    the basis of the evidence before me.

Decision and reasons

10. The only  evidence  the  Judge  had  before  him  was  the  documentary
    evidence; the Appellant had requested a decision on the papers and  the
    Respondent had not requested  an  oral  hearing.  In  relation  to  the
    Immigration  Rules,  specified  evidence  must  be  provided  with  the
    application. There was simply no documentary evidence  before  me  that
    the Appellant had submitted the requisite  evidence  of  the  Sponsor's
    savings with her application and, as accepted by the Sponsor, there was
    no such evidence before the Judge. There was also  no  evidence  before
    the Judge to establish that the savings of the Appellant complied  with
    the provisions of paragraph 11 of Appendix FM-SE. There  can  therefore
    be no error of law in  relation  to  the  Judge's  decision  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

11. As to the assessment under Article 8, as the decision in MM  was  found
    to be legally flawed by the Court of Appeal on the issue relied  on  by
    the Judge (that is that the combination of the features relating to the
    maintenance  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  resulted  in  a
    disproportionate interference with the rights of British  citizens  and
    their spouses), it was legally  flawed  at  the  date  of  the  Judge's
    decision and, in the absence  of  any  other  compelling  circumstances
    being identified by the Judge for allowing the appeal under Article  8,
    it follows that, as submitted by Mr  Mills,  the  Judge's  decision  is
    unsafe and must be set aside. The only other reason identified  by  the
    Judge was that it was unreasonable to expect the  Sponsor  to  live  in
    Canada. He did  not,  as  submitted  in  the  grounds  of  application,
    consider that the  Appellant  could  make  a  further  application  and
    whether it would be disproportionate interference with her  rights  and
    those of the Sponsor to require her to do so. This too  is  a  material
    error of law as it was capable of making a difference to the outcome of
    the appeal.

12. I therefore set aside the decision if the Judge and remake the decision
    under Article 8 as follows:

13. I note from the decision that although the notice of refusal is said to
    have been issued on 8 January 2013 (and this could not  have  been  the
    case because the on-line application  was  not  submitted  until  March
    2013), the Appellant in the grounds of  appeal  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal stated that the notice of refusal was dated 8 April  2013.  As
    the application was made in March, the time  it  took  to  process  the
    application was no more  than  one  month.  I  can  only  consider  the
    circumstances appertaining at the date of decision. The Entry Clearance
    Manager in his review of the decision accepted that there is a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship between the Appellant and the  Sponsor  and
    that they intend to live together permanently such  that  there  is  an
    interference with their Article 8 rights.  However,  such  interference
    will not have consequences of such gravity as to potentially engage the
    operation of Article  8  when  the  only  consequence  is  a  temporary
    separation of between 2 - 4 months  whilst  a  further  application  is
    being processed. This is particularly  so  when  it  is  the  Sponsor's
    evidence that he himself had savings, evidence  of  which  he  had  not
    submitted. Even taking into account the  Sponsor's  evidence  that  the
    continued separation  between  them  was  causing  a  strain  on  their
    relationship, the evidence was that due to the  processing  times,  the
    consequences of the decision did not amount to compelling circumstances
    for allowing the decision under Article 8. As to the Sponsor's mother's
    medical condition, there was simply no evidence before me of her health
    as at the date of decision. It would appear from the Sponsor's evidence
    that his mother would  only  retire  if  his  wife  was  granted  entry
    clearance, which would indicate that her condition is not  such  as  to
    result in retirement through ill -health. I find that Article 8 is  not
    engaged in this case and there  are  no  compelling  circumstances  for
    granting leave outside the Immigration Rules.

Decision

14. There are material errors of law in the determination of  Judge  Hunter
    as set out above such that the determination falls to be set  aside  on
    the Article 8 rounds only. For the reasons set out above, I remake  the
    decision to dismiss the Appellant's appeal under Article 8.

15. The Respondent's appeal is allowed.

Anonymity

16. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)
   of the Asylum and immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and  I  see
   no reason why an order should be made pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal
   Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

TO THE RESPONDENT

In light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (procedure) Rules
2005 and section 12(4) (a) of the Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act
2007.

As I have dismissed the Appellant's appeal, I make no fee order.
