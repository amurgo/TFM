Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms A Nizami, Counsel instructed by Turpin and Miller
LLP solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr D Clarke, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the  First-
   tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the respondent's decision  on
   7 December 2017 to make a  deportation  order  against  him  pursuant  to
   Regulation 23(6)(b) with  Regulation  27  of  the  Immigration  (European
   Economic Area) Regulations 2016.  The appellant is a citizen of Portugal.





Background

2. The appellant has been in the  United  Kingdom  since  approximately  May
   2000.  He has a history of offending, having been convicted on 7 February
   2006  of  driving  a  motor  vehicle  with  excess  alcohol  (fined   and
   disqualified from driving for 12 months, licence endorsed); on  29  April
   2009, on 7 counts of  supplying  a  controlled  drug,  for  which  on  11
   September 2009 he was sentenced to 2�  years'  imprisonment;  on  1  June
   2011, for common assault (56 days' imprisonment and a  restraining  order
   to protect the victim); and on 23 April 2015, for conspiracy to possess a
   class A drug (heroin) with intent to supply, for which on 1 June 2015  he
   was sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment and a victim surcharge.

3. At an  appeal  hearing  in  November  2010,  the  immigration  judge  was
   satisfied that the appellant had acquired a permanent right of  residence
   in the United Kingdom under Regulation 15 of  the  Immigration  (European
   Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

4. The respondent in his refusal letter in 2017  did  not  accept  that  the
   appellant had continued to reside and exercise Treaty  rights  thereafter
   and considered,  therefore,  that  the  appellant  might  have  lost  his
   permanent residence entitlement. The appellant was  not,  in  any  event,
   entitled to the highest level of protection because he could not show  10
   years' lawful residence before his imprisonment for the index offence  on
   1 June 2015.

5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

First-tier Tribunal decision

6. The First-tier Judge noted that the appellant  had  been  warned  of  the
   risk of deportation if he continued to offend after his 2010 appeal,  but
   had nevertheless continued to do so, committing an  assault  against  his
   former partner, and further heroin dealing offences, from which he  would
   have had significant profit as well as paying for his own supply.

7. The First-tier Judge noted that the appellant claimed  to  have  been  in
   the United Kingdom for 16 years and was now 42 years  old.   He  accepted
   that the appellant had been working in the United Kingdom and  exercising
   Treaty rights here, but that  he  was  estranged  from  both  his  former
   partner and his wife.  He had four children with his ex-partner, but  had
   no direct contact with any of them: he had only indirect contact with his
   two younger children, who lived with their maternal grandmother.  His ex-
   partner had moved away and the appellant had no contact at all  with  his
   older two daughters, who were teenagers.

8. The appellant had a heroin habit but was trying to break it.   The  Judge
   accepted that at the date of hearing he was drug free  but  that,  having
   regard to the lengthy periods he had spent in prison, his integration was
   'severely detracted from', particularly in the light of his drug dealing.
    Any interference with  the  appellant's  rehabilitation  by  removal  to
   Portugal, which he had last visited in 2005/2006, would be justified.

9. The Judge noted that the index offence attracted a sentence of more  than
   4 years and that applying section 117C of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
   and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended) the appellant therefore needed  to  show
   very compelling circumstances over and above those set out in  Exceptions
   1 and 2 in that section.   Exception 1 did not apply,  as  the  appellant
   was neither socially nor culturally integrated in the United Kingdom  and
   nothing in the grounds of appeal reached the  level  of  very  compelling
   circumstances over and above the Exceptions.

10. The Judge accepted that the appellant  had  family  life  with  his  two
   younger children, but by way of indirect contact,  which  could  continue
   when he returned to Portugal.   The  appellant's  removal  would  not  be
   disproportionate and the appeal was dismissed.

11. The appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal.

Permission to appeal

12. Permission to appeal  was  granted  on  all  the  grounds  advanced,  as
   follows:

    "2.  The grounds argue that the Judge erred as follows:   Ground  1  at
    [9] of his decision, in his assessment of risk with  reference  to  the
    OASys report; Ground 2, in his interpretation of the Judge's sentencing
    remarks; Ground 3, in  his  assessment  of  the  question  whether  the
    appellant poses 'a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat' to
    one  of  the  fundamental  interests  of  society;  ground  4,  in  his
    assessment of Article 8 ECHR, in terms of the  appellant's  prospective
    contact with his children. ..."

Rule 24 Reply

13. There was no Rule 24 Reply for the respondent.

14. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Upper Tribunal hearing

15. In oral argument, Ms Nizami repeated the  contents  of  the  grounds  of
   appeal.  She contended that the OASys report was nuanced and balanced and
   that the First-tier Judge had not given it sufficient weight.  The author
   of the report was a probation officer who knew the appellant well and was
   in a position to give a view on his risk profile.

16. Ms Nizami reminded us that the First-tier  Judge  had  found  that  this
   appellant had achieved a permanent right of  residence  before  the  2009
   sentencing remarks and contended that the Judge should  have  found  that
   the appellant did not present a genuine, present and sufficiently serious
   threat to the fundamental interests of the United  Kingdom.  The  Judge's
   reasons at [11] were inadequate.

17. Ms Nizami accepted that the appellant had no direct contact with any  of
   his four children and confirmed that  no  contact  proceedings  had  been
   issued in relation to that situation.  The appellant  hoped  to  pay  for
   legal advice once he was permitted to work again, and  in  the  meantime,
   there was evidence that his eldest daughter, now age 16, was  seeking  to
   resume contact via Facebook.  She relied on Razgar v Secretary  of  State
   for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 27 at [53] and argued that in certain
   situations, the state  had  an  obligation  to  take  positive  steps  to
   encourage family life.

18. Ms Nizami argued that the appellant had demonstrated  a  material  error
   of law and the decision should be set aside for remaking in due course.

19. For the respondent, Mr Clarke  noted  that  at  [9]  of  the  First-tier
   Judge's decision, he had gone way beyond reliance on  the  OASys  report.
   He had taken account of the sentencing remarks,  of  the  fact  that  the
   appellant was selling drugs not only  to  fund  his  own  habit  but  for
   significant profit, that he had committed further  offences  after  2009,
   that he had been treated as a category 3 significant drug dealer and that
   he had never admitted the offence. The First-tier Judge had been entitled
   to take account of the seriousness of the conduct relied upon and of  the
   burgeoning pattern of offending mentioned at page 18 of the OASys report.



20. The  First-tier  Judge  correctly  treated  the  2010  decision  as  the
   Devaseelan starting point for his decision, noting that the appellant had
   continued to use heroin and to profit from his drug  dealing  activities,
   as well as paying for his own supply.  The First-tier  Judge  found  that
   the situation had become more serious since that  conviction,  which  was
   open to him on the facts.

21. As regards  the  Article  8  ECHR  claim,  that  was  misconceived:  the
   appellant was a foreign national offender whose offending attracted a  5-
   year sentence and there was a public interest in deporting him.   Removal
   was not unduly harsh: the family life on which the  appellant  sought  to
   rely was presently only indirect contact with his two  younger  children,
   which could be maintained from Portugal.  The  appellant  had  not  shown
   very compelling circumstances over  and  above  exceptions  1  and  2  in
   section 117C and putative future family life was not capable  of  meeting
   that test.

22. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be upheld.

Analysis

23. This appellant is a foreign criminal as defined by section 32 of the  UK
   Borders Act 2007.  In EEA terms, he is a 'medium' offender, as set out in
   Regulation 27(3) of the 2016 EEA Regulations.  It is not  suggested  that
   the higher 'imperative' grounds test applies  to  him.  Contrary  to  the
   position taken by the respondent in his refusal  letter,  the  First-tier
   Judge accepted that the appellant had established a  permanent  right  of
   residence before his imprisonment and not lost it subsequently.

24. The respondent may not remove the appellant  under  Regulation  23(6)(b)
   except on serious grounds of public policy and public security  and  only
   then, pursuant to Regulation 27(5), if the decision is proportionate  and
   his personal conduct represents  a  'genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
   serious threat affecting one of the  fundamental  interests  of  society,
   taking into account past conduct of the person and that the  threat  does
   not need to be imminent'.

25. In this case, the appellant  is  a  recidivist  dealer  in  heroin,  for
   profit as well as his own use, who for the moment appears not to be using
   the drug. There is still a restraining order  in  place  and  he  has  no
   partner nor any direct contact with any of his  children  in  the  United
   Kingdom.

26. The appellant in his grounds of appeal argued that it was  not  open  to
   the First-tier Judge to find that there was  a  significant  increase  in
   seriousness in his conduct and behaviour, because  the  sentencing  judge
   said in 2015 that the offence committed was exactly the same as in  2009.
   However, the sentencing judge in 2015 clearly viewed the  second  offence
   more seriously, sentencing him to 5 years  imprisonment,  not  2�  as  in
   2009.  The OASys report was broadly supportive of the appellant  but  the
   weight to be given to evidence is a matter for the First-tier Tribunal as
   the fact-finding Tribunal.  In this appeal, we  are  satisfied  that  the
   First-tier Judge gave appropriate weight to all the evidence  before  him
   and was entitled to reach the factual conclusions he did,  including  the
   weight he placed on  the  OASys  report.   It  cannot  be  said  that  he
   overlooked that report.

27.  The  First-tier  Judge  gave  adequate  reasons   for   regarding   the
   appellant's conduct as having increased in seriousness between  2009  and
   2015. Despite warnings that if he reoffended he  faced  deportation,  the
   appellant had continued not just to use heroin but to deal it for profit.



28. The First-tier Judge was entitled to find that the  appellant  presented
   a 'genuine present and sufficiently serious threat'  to  the  fundamental
   interests of the United Kingdom.  As  stated  by  the  sentencing  Judge,
   dealers in heroin cause grave harm to society and  to  individuals.   The
   appellant has twice been found to be such a person and has only  recently
   attempted to give up  his  habit,  while  in  prison.   The  question  of
   rehabilitation is not determinative in this appeal as  the  appellant  is
   not fully integrated,  despite  having  acquired  a  permanent  right  of
   residence (see MC (Essa principles recast)  [2015]  UKUT  520  (IAC)  and
   Secretary of State for the Home Department v  Dumliauskas  &  Ors  [2015]
   EWCA Civ 145).  Treatment for his problems would  also  be  available  in
   Portugal, if required.

29. There remains the question of Section 117C  of  the  2002  Act  and  the
   statutory presumptions therein. The appellant is a foreign  criminal  and
   section 117C of the 2002 Act was  applicable  to  him.   Section  117C(1)
   states that the  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
   interest.

30.  Section 117C, so far as relevant, is as follows:

         "117C    Article 8: additional considerations  in  cases  involving
         foreign criminals
          1)  The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
             interest.
          2) The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
             the greater is the  public  interest  in  deportation  of  the
             criminal. ...
         3)     Exception 1 applies where-
             a) C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most
                of C's life,
             b) C is  socially  and  culturally  integrated  in  the  United
                Kingdom, and
             c) there would be very significant obstacles to C's integration
                into the country to which C is proposed to be deported.
         (5)  Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.
         (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public  interest
         requires   deportation   unless   there   are    very    compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2. ..."

31. The appellant cannot bring himself within  Exception  1.   He  lived  in
   Portugal until 16 years ago and he is only 42 now.  He has not  lived  in
   the United Kingdom for 'most of his life'.   There is no challenge in the
   grounds of appeal to the First-tier Judge's finding that he had not shown
   'very significant obstacles' to his reintegration into Portugal, nor that
   he was not fully integrated here, given his imprisonments and his  heroin
   habit.

32. As regards Exception 2, whilst the First-tier Judge accepted that  there
   was family life, albeit indirect, between the appellant and  his  younger
   two children, there was no  evidence  whatsoever  to  indicate  that  the
   effect of his removal on those children, or any of his children, would be
   unduly harsh.

33. The First-tier Judge was fully entitled to find, on the  evidence,  that
   the appellant  remained  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
   threat.  Section 117C does not avail him since he  cannot  bring  himself
   within either of the Exceptions  therein  nor  has  he  demonstrated,  as
   section 117C(6) requires, that there are very  exceptional  circumstances
   over and above those described in the  Exceptions.  I  therefore  dismiss
   this appeal and uphold the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

DECISION

34. For the foregoing reasons, our decision is as follows:

   The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error on  a
   point of law


   I do not set aside the decision but order that it shall stand.
