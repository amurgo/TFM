                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Shola Grace Oluwamakinde, was born on  13  January  1985
    and is a citizen of Nigeria.  By a decision dated  19  June  2013,  the
    appellant was refused leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 4
    (General)  Student  Migrant.   The  appellant  appealed  against   that
    decision  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Deavin)  which,  in  a
    determination which was promulgated on 19 November 2013, dismissed  the
    appeal.  The appellant now  appeals,  with  permission,  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 2. The appellant's application had  been  refused  on  the  basis  of  her
    failure to prove that she had sufficient funds.  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Grubb,  granting  permission  to  appeal,  summarised  the  grounds  as
    follows:

         The grounds argue that, in requiring  [the  appellant]  to  show  a
         balance of �5,780 both respondent and the judge wrongly  based  the
         calculation on the total fee for her two year course rather than as
         the Rules require, only the first year's  fee  (plus  maintenance).
         She relies on further documentation including  a  letter  from  her
         college explaining the total fee  for  the  two  year  ACCA  course
         (�7,560) was payable before commencing the course and she had  paid
         50% (�3,780) upfront.  If that is correct, then arguably the  first
         year's fees had already  been  paid  and  the  appellant  was  only
         required to show she had the  maintenance  funds  for  two  months.
         That would be �2,000 for Inner London (which she had in  her  bank)
         but the college letter also identifies that the course may not have
         been based in London in any event but that would  only  reduce  the
         funds the appellant was required to have.

         While the appellant has maintained throughout the appeal (albeit it
         was decided on the papers) that the required course fee was �7,560,
         it is at least  arguable  this  was  a  misunderstanding  that  the
         respondent (and the First-tier Tribunal) proceeded on the basis  of
         a mistaken fact that could, arguably, amount to  an  error  of  law
         (see E&R [2003] EWCA Civ 1032).

 3. There is a Confirmation of Acceptance for  Studies  (CAS)  from  Kaplan
    dated 22 January 2013 which indicates that the first year  of  fees  of
    the college would be �7,560.   It  was  this  CAS  that  the  appellant
    submitted to the respondent in support of her application.

 4. The appellant seeks to rely upon two further letters from  Kaplan,  one
    dated 19 December 2013 which records that,

         Please note the CAS ... covers the student for the period  of  four
         terms (i.e. 22 months).  Due  to  nature  of  the  course  package,
         students are required to pay  the  full  costs  before  the  course
         commencement date so that 'first year fees' in  this  case  in  the
         entire cost of the ACCA programme the student  is  being  sponsored
         for.  The total cost was �7,560 as per CAS whereas the student paid
         50% deposit upfront (�3,780).

    The letter goes on to record that there has "been a 50% discount agreed
    on top of any existing ones.  In effect, the student's  total  for  the
    ACCA programme (the same period of time) changed to �2,850."

 5. There is a second letter (wrongly dated 17 January  2013;  the  parties
    agree that the date should be 17 January 2014) which offers  a  further
    explanation.  This letter notes that,

         [the appellant] was informed by Kaplan Leeds that she needed to pay
         the first year's fee (�3,780) upfront and could pay  the  remaining
         balance in instalments over the four terms.   Due  to  an  internal
         error, the first year's fees were incorrectly stated on the CAS  as
         �7,560 instead of the correct amount of �3,780.

 6. The appellant seeks to rely upon the Court of Appeal authority  of  E&R
    (see above).  At [66], the Court of Appeal  detailed  circumstances  in
    which an error of fact may give rise  to  unfairness  amounting  to  an
    error of law:

         In our view, the time has now come to accept that a mistake of fact
         giving rise to unfairness is a separate head  of  challenge  in  an
         appeal on a point of law, at  least  in  those  statutory  contexts
         where the parties share an interest in co-operating to achieve  the
         correct result. Asylum law is undoubtedly  such  an  area.  Without
         seeking to lay down a precise code, the ordinary requirements for a
         finding of unfairness are apparent from the above analysis of CICB.
         First, there must have been a  mistake  as  to  an  existing  fact,
         including a mistake  as  to  the  availability  of  evidence  on  a
         particular matter. Secondly, the fact or evidence  must  have  been
         "established",  in  the  sense  that  it  was   uncontentious   and
         objectively verifiable. Thirdly, the appellant  (or  his  advisers)
         must not been have been responsible for the mistake. Fourthly,  the
         mistake must have played a material (not necessarily decisive) part
         in the Tribunal's reasoning.

 7. I find that the appellant failed to show  that  an  error  of  law  has
    occurred in this instance.  I find the appellant fails  in  respect  of
    the third requirement referred to by the Court of Appeal in  E&R  ("the
    appellant or her advisers  must  not  have  been  responsible  for  the
    mistake.")   I  accept  the  appellant  and  her  advisers   were   not
    responsible for the error actually occurring on the face  of  the  CAS;
    Kaplan Financial accept that they are responsible for  that  error.   I
    do, however, find that the appellant and her advisers  are  responsible
    for the mistake having led to the dismissal of the appeal in the First-
    tier Tribunal.  The letters from Kaplan indicate that the appellant was
    fully  aware  of  their  financial  arrangements  with  her   and,   in
    particular, what she had to pay to Kaplan in respect of course fees.  I
    find that the error on the face of the CAS would have been apparent  to
    the appellant from the moment the document came into  her  hands.   Not
    only did the appellant fail to  raise  any  query  with  Kaplan  having
    received the CAS, she sent it to  the  respondent  in  support  of  her
    application when she ought  to  have  known  that  it  contained  false
    information.  She  then  compounded  that  error  making  no  reference
    whatever to  the  inaccurate  CAS  in  her  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Judge Deavin, dealing with the matter  on  the  papers,  had
    before him grounds of appeal drafted by the appellant's representatives
    which complained only of an alleged failure by the respondent to  apply
    an "evidential flexibility policy" and sought to explain the  shortfall
    in the appellant's  funds  by  reference  to  money  "available  in  my
    sponsor's bank account statement which  I  failed  to  submit  at  that
    material  time"  (presumably  the  time  at  which  she  submitted  the
    application).  I do not accept that the appellant only became aware  of
    the error in the CAS after her appeal had been dismissed in the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  The appellant was, therefore, the  author  of  her  own
    misfortune before the First-tier Tribunal. I find that she  has  failed
    to show that the First-tier Tribunal erred in  law  by  dismissing  her
    appeal. In  the  circumstances,  I  find  that  the  appeal  should  be
    dismissed.

DECISION

 8. This appeal is dismissed.
